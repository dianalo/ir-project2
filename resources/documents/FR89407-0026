Background </ITAG>A. Authority On January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulationsimplementing section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published an amended list of hazardouswastes from non-specific and specific sources. This list has been amendedseveral times, and is published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. These wastesare listed as hazardous because they typically and frequently exhibit oneor more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in SubpartC of Part 261 (<T3>i.e.</T3>, ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and extraction procedure(EP) toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(2) or (a)(3). Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials,industrial processes, and other factors. Thus, while a waste that is describedin these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individualfacility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason, 40CFR 260.20 and 260.22 provide an exclusion procedure, allowing personsto demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facilityshould not be regulated as a hazardous waste. To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generatedat their facilities do not meet any of the criteria for which the wasteswere listed. See 40 CFR 260.22(a) and the background documents for thelisted wastes. In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA)of 1984 require the Agency to consider any factors (including additionalconstituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if thereis a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factors could causethe waste to be hazardous. Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstratethat the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics(<T3>i.e.,</T3> ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and EP toxicity),and must present sufficient information for the Agency to determine whetherthe waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See 40 CFR260.22(a), 42 USC 6921(f), and the background documents for the listedwastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (<T3>i.e.,</T3> excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or notthey exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste, generatorsremain obligated to determine whether or not their waste remains non-hazardousbased on the hazardous waste characteristics. In addition to wastes listed as hazardous in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32,residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastesand mixtures containing hazardous wastes also are eligible for exclusionand remain hazardous wastes until excluded. See 40 CFR 261.3 (c) and (d)(2).The substantive standard for ``delisting'' a treatment residue or a mixtureis the same as previously described for listed wastes. B. Approach Used to Evaluate This Petition In making a delisting determination, the Agency evaluates each petitionedwaste against the listing criteria and factors cited in 40 CFR 261.11 (a)(2)and (a)(3). If the Agency believes that the waste remains hazardous basedon the factors for which the waste was originally listed, EPA will proposeto deny the petition. If, however, the Agency agrees with the petitionerthat the waste is non-hazardous with respect to the original listing criteria,EPA then will evaluate the waste with respect to other factors or criteria,if there is a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factorscould cause the waste to be hazardous. The Agency considers whether thewaste is acutely toxic, and considers the toxicity of the constituents,the concentration of the constituents in the waste, their tendency to migrateand to bioaccumulate, their persistence in the environment once releasedfrom the waste, plausible and specific types of management of the petitioned waste, the quantities of waste generated, and any other additional factorswhich may characterize the petitioned waste. The Agency is proposing to use such information to identify plausible exposureroutes for hazardous constituents present in the waste, and is proposingto use an organic leachate model and a fate and transport model to predictthe concentration of hazardous constituents that may be released from thepetitioned waste after disposal and to determine the potential impact ofthe unregulated disposal of BSC's petitioned waste on human health andthe environment. Specifically, the models will be used to predict compliance-pointconcentrations which will be compared directly to the levels of regulatoryconcern for particular hazardous constituents. EPA believes that this fate and transport model represents a reasonableworst-case waste disposal scenario for the petitioned waste, and that areasonable worst-case scenario is appropriate when evaluating whether awaste should be relieved of the protective management constraints of RCRASubtitle C. Because a delisted waste is no longer subject to hazardouswaste control, the Agency is generally unable to predict and does not controlhow a waste will be managed after delisting. Therefore, EPA currently believesthat it is inappropriate to consider extensive site-specific factors. Forexample, a generator may petition the Agency for delisting of a metal hydroxidesludge which is currently being managed in an on-site landfill and providedata on the nearest drinking water well, permeability of the aquifer, dispersivities,etc. If the Agency were to base its evaluation solely on these site specificfactors, the Agency might conclude that the waste, at that specific location,cannot affect the closest well, and the Agency might grant the petition.Upon promulgation of the exclusion, however, the generator is under noobligation to continue to manage the waste at the on-site landfill. Infact, it is likely that the generator will either choose to send the delistedwaste off site immediately, or will eventually reach the capacity of theon-site facility and subsequently send the waste off site to a facilitywhich may have very different hydrogeological and exposure conditions.The Agency also considers the applicability of ground-water monitoringdata to its evaluation of delisting petitions. In this case, the Agencydetermined that, because BSC is seeking a delisting for waste managed onsite, ground-water monitoring data collected from the area where the petitionedwaste is contained are necessary to determine whether hazardous constituentshave migrated to the underlying ground water. Ground-water monitoring datacollected from BSC's monitoring wells will help characterize the potentialimpact (if any) of the unregulated disposal of BSC's waste on human healthand the environment. Finally, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 specificallyrequire the Agency to provide notice and an opportunity for comment beforegranting or denying a final exclusion. Thus, a final decision will notbe made until all  public comments (including those at requested hearings,if any) on today's proposal are addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Delisting Petition </ITAG>A. Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Lackawanna, New York <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Petition for Exclusion </ITAG>Bethlehem Steel Corporation, located in Lackawanna, New York was engagedin primary metal-making and coke-making operations prior to 1983. BSC petitionedthe Agency to exclude, on a one-time basis, the waste contained in an on-site5.4 acre landfill, presently listed as EPA Hazardous Waste No. K060_``Ammoniastill lime sludge from coking operations''. The listed constituents ofconcern for EPA Hazardous Waste No. K060 are cyanide, naphthalene, phenoliccompounds, and arsenic. BSC refers to this landfill as Hazardous WasteManagement Unit No. 2 (HWM-2). Although only a portion of the waste inthe landfill is the ammonia still lime sludge, the entire volume of wasteis considered to be a listed waste in accordance with 40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv)(<T3>i.e., </T3>the mixture rule). The mixture of listed ammonia still limesludge and solid waste contained in HWM-2 are the subject of this petition.BSC petitioned to exclude its waste because it does not believe that thewaste meets the criteria of the listing. BSC claims that its ammonia stilllime sludge is not hazardous because the constituents of concern, althoughpresent in the waste, are present in either insignificant concentrationsor, if present at significant levels, are essentially in immobile forms.BSC also believes that this waste is not hazardous for   any other reason(i.e., there are no additional constituents or factors that could causethe waste to be hazardous). Review of this petition included considerationof the original listing criteria, as well as the additional factors requiredby the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. See section 222 ofthe Amendments, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and 40 CFR 260.22(d)(2)(4). Today'sproposal to deny this petition for delisting is the result of the Agency'sevaluation of BSC's petition. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Background </ITAG>BSC petitioned the Agency to exclude the waste contained in its on-sitelandfill on July 18, 1984 and subsequently provided additional information.In support of its petition, BSC submitted (1) detailed descriptions ofits manufacturing process, including schematic diagrams; (2) a list ofraw materials and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all tradenamematerials that might be expected to have contributed to the waste; (3)total constituent and EP leachate analyses for the EP toxic metals, nickel,and cyanide on several samples of the petitioned waste; (4) total constituentanalyses for sulfide on samples of the petitioned waste; (5) total oiland grease analyses data on samples of the petitioned waste; (6) resultsfrom characteristics testing for ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivitydata; (7) total constituent analyses of the petitioned waste for the organicconstituents for which the waste was listed (naphthalene and phenolics)and benzene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene,indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, and tetrachloroethylene; and (8) ground-water monitoringdata collected from wells monitoring the on-site landfill. BSC conducted primary metal-making and coke-making operations during theperiod the ammonia still lime sludge was generated. In October 1983, BSCdiscontinued its primary metal-making operations and modified its cokingprocesses so that the ammonia still lime sludge was no longer generated.(BSC now uses sodium hydroxide as the strong base at the ammonia stillrather than lime slurry, and therefore ammonia still lime sludge is nolonger generated.) BSC's steel-making process involved refining molten iron with oxygen, flux(<T3>i.e., </T3>dolomite or lime), and alloying materials in a basic oxygenfurnace to produce carbon steels. BSC's iron-making process involved smeltingof iron bearing materials (<T3>i.e., </T3>iron ore, sinter, and scrap) with coke, flux (<T3>i.e., </T3>dolomite and lime), and preheated air in blast furnaces.The blast furnace slurry disposed of in BSC's landfill originated fromthe water scrubbing of blast furnace gas. Coke-making involves the destructive distillation of bituminous coal incoke ovens. Volatile matter evolves during the coking process (includingthe moisture content of the coal) and leaves the ovens through coke ovengas off-takes. This hot coke oven gas is cooled by spraying it with recycledflushing liquor consisting of a weak ammonia liquor (WAL) solution. Asthe coke oven gas is cooled, water and tar are condensed. The tar fractionis separated from the aqueous WAL in a decanter. The majority of the WALis recycled back to the coke oven gas cooling process as flushing liquor.Any excess WAL is processed by solvent extraction to recover phenol orsodium phenolate. The excess WAL then is processed by steam stripping torelease aqueous ammonia into the gas phase in an ammonia still. In theupper portion of the still, free ammonia is stripped by steam (at temperaturesof about 100 anddegrees;C) and ammonia vapor rising from the lower portion.In the lower portion of the still, fixed ammonia compounds are dissociatedby adjusting the pH with lime slurry and then injecting steam. The spentammonia still lime slurry is drawn off the bottom and discharged to oneof two settling basins. The sludge that settles out in these basins (<T3>i.e., </T3>ammonia still lime sludge) is subsequently placed in theon-site landfill. As stated previously, BSC disposed of its ammonia still lime sludge inits on-site landfill with other solid wastes between 1969 and Novemberof 1983. BSC is not currently disposing of wastes in the landfill. Basedon available records, BSC claims that less than two percent of the wasteplaced in the landfill is ammonia still lime sludge. The most significantwastes (by volume) that were disposed of in the landfill included: blastfurnace thickener sludge, basic oxygen furnace thickener sludge, cold rollingmill wastewater treatment sludge, and dredging spoils (from Smokes Creek).Only the ammonia still lime sludge is a listed hazardous waste.To collect representative samples from a waste disposed of in a landfilllike BSC's, petitioners are normally requested to divide the unit into10,000 square foot sections and randomly collect five full-depth core samplesfrom each section. The five full-depth core samples are then composited(mixed) by section to produce composite samples. See ``Test Methods forEvaluating Solid Wastes: Physical/Chemical Methods,'' U.S. EPA, Officeof Solid Waste and Emergency Response, Publication SW-846 (third edition),November 1986, and ``Petitions to Delist Hazardous Waste_A Guidance Manual,''U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste, (EPA/530-SW-85-003), April 1985. BSC's preliminary sampling demonstration included data on ten samples collectedfrom the landfill in March 1984. A detailed description of procedures usedto collect three of these samples was not provided. For the remaining sevensamples, BSC divided the landfill into four sections and randomly selecteda partial core sample (<T3>i.e., </T3>two-foot core samples were taken as opposed to full-depthcore samples) from each of the four sections, two partial core samplesfrom the central portion of the landfill, and an additional partial coresample from the southeast section. A grab sample was then taken from eachof these seven core samples, resulting in seven grab samples. The threesamples for which sampling procedure descriptions were not provided wereanalyzed for total constituent (<T3>i.e., </T3>mass of a particular constituent per mass of waste) andextraction procedure (EP) leachable (<T3>i.e., </T3>mass of a particular constituent per unit volume of extract)concentrations of arsenic, cyanide, naphthalene, and phenolic compounds.The extraction procedure used in these analyses, however, was not equivalentto the procedure described in SW-846 Method 1310 and therefore these datawere not considered in the evaluation of BSC's petition. (For a more detaileddescription of the extraction procedure used by BSC, see the public docketfor today's notice.) The remaining seven grab samples were analyzed forleachable concentrations of the EP toxic metals, nickel, cyanide, and sulfideusing SW-846 Method 1310; total concentrations of sulfide; and the characteristicsof corrosivity and reactivity. BSC collected a second set of samples during April 1984. To collect thesesamples, BSC divided the landfill into six sections of approximately equalsize. Within each section, six discrete samples were taken at random depthsfrom evenly spaced boring locations. The samples then were composited,by section, to form six representative samples, one composite per section.These six composite samples were analyzed for total constituent concentrationsof the EP toxic metals, nickel, cyanide, sulfide, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene,naphthalene, phenolic compounds, and tetrachloroethylene. In addition,these six composite samples were analyzed for leachable concentrationsof the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide; total oil and grease content;and the characteristic of ignitability. At EPA's request, BSC conducted additional sampling and testing of thecentral portion of the landfill in February of 1985. Specifically, BSCcollected approximately ten two-foot long core samples from six locationswithin the central portion of the landfill. For each of the six locations,grab samples were taken from each of the core samples (approximately ten)and composited. These six composite samples were analyzed for total constituentand leachable concentrations of the EP toxic metals (excluding mercury,selenium, and silver), nickel, and cyanide. In addition, these six compositesamples were analyzed for total constituent concentrations of sulfide,benzene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene,indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, naphthalene, and phenolic compounds; and totaloil and grease content. BSC claims that the composite samples collected in support of the petitionare representative of any variation in constituent concentrations in thewaste. Furthermore, BSC believes that the contents of the landfill arerelatively homogenous because boring logs prepared during the samplingprograms indicate that the materials bored through are relatively uniformin appearance. BSC states that these borings did not indicate any stratificationof landfill contents. Because the landfill cell is 5.4 acres (with a maximum depth of 22 feet),the Agency believes that BSC should have divided the landfill cell intoat least 23 sections and collected at least 23 composite samples of landfillwaste. Each of these 23 composite samples would have had to be analyzedfor total constituent and EP leachate concentrations of the EP toxic metals,nickel, and cyanide; total constituent concentrations of sulfide, naphthalene,phenol, and all other hazardous constituents (<T3>e.g., </T3>those listed in 40 CFR Part 261, Appendix VIII) potentiallypresent in the waste; and total oil and grease content. Although the landfillsamples collected may not be completely representative of all of the wastecontained in the landfill, the Agency considers these samples to be representativeof at least a portion of the petitioned waste and, therefore, consideredthese samples in the evaluation of BSC's petition. Because there was sufficientbasis to propose denial of the petition, the Agency did not request BSCto conduct more complete sampling and analyses. BSC also submitted ground-water monitoring information collected from wellsmonitoring the landfill to demonstrate that waste contained in the landfillwas not adversely impacting ground-water quality. The ground-water monitoringinformation submitted by BSC and received from State and EPA Regional authoritiesincluded: (1) Well location information; (2) boring logs and well constructioninformation for each well; (3) water levels and water level contour maps;and (4) results of the analysis of ground-water samples. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Agency Analysis </ITAG>BSC used SW-846 Methods 7060 through 7760 to quantify the total constituentconcentrations of the EP toxic metals and nickel. ``Methods for ChemicalAnalysis of Water and Wastes'' Method 335.2 (April 1984 samples) and SW-846Method 9010 (February 1985 samples) were used to quantify total cyanideconcentrations in the petitioned waste. SW-846 Method 9030 was used toquantify total sulfide levels in the petitioned waste. SW-846 Method 1310was used to determine the leachable concentrations of the EP toxic metals,nickel, and cyanide. Table 1 presents the maximum reported total constituentand EP leachate concentrations of the EP toxic metals, nickel, cyanide,and sulfide. (Analysis for EP leachable concentrations of sulfide (or reactivesulfide) is not necessary because the Agency's level of regulatory concernis based on the total constituent concentration of reactive sulfide.)<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Maximum Total Constituent and EP Leachate Concentrations (ppm) LandfillWaste  </T4><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Total constituent analyses </H1><H1>EP leachate analyses </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic<D>16.2</D><D>0.034 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium<D>1,660</D><D>1.48 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>3.30</D><D>0.015 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>172</D><D>0.144 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>7,520</D><D>1.61 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D>0.268</D><D>0.0007 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>64.6</D><D>0.59 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium<D>2.60</D><D>0.008 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver<D>andless;0.05</D><D>andless;0.001 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide (total)<D>43.1</D><D>1.22 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sulfide<D>0.15</D><D/><F>andless; Denotes that the constituent was not detected at the detectionlimit specified in the table.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The detection limits in Table 1 (and Table 2 that follows) represent thelowest concentrations quantifiable by BSC when using the appropriate analyticalmethods to analyze the petitioned waste. (Detection limits may vary accordingto the waste and waste matrix being analyzed, <T3>i.e., </T3>the ``cleanliness'' of waste matrices vary and ``dirty''waste matrices may cause interferences, thus raising the detection limits.)Using ``Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (14thedition)'' Method 502D, BSC determined that the maximum oil and greasecontent of the petitioned waste was 0.93 percent; therefore, the EP analysesdid not have to be modified in accordance with the Oily Waste EP methodology.(Wastes having more than one percent total oil and grease may either havesignificant concentrations of constituents of concern in the oil phase,which may not be assessed using the standard EP leachate procedure, orthe concentration of oil and grease may be sufficient to coat the solidphase of the sample and interfere with the leaching of metals from thesample.) See SW-846 Method 1330. On the basis of test results providedby BSC, pursuant to 40 CFR 260.22, none of the samples analyzed exhibitedthe characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity. See 40CFR 261.21, 261.22, and 261.23, respectively. BSC used unreferenced gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) methods(April 1984 samples) and SW-846 Methods (February 1985 samples) to quantifybenzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and tetrachloroethylene concentrations. SW-846Methods were also used to quantify the total constituent concentrationsof benzo(k)fluoranthene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene,and naphthalene. <T3>Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste </T3>Method 420.1(April 1984 samples) and SW-846 Methods (February 1985 samples) were usedto quantify phenol levels. Table 2 presents the maximum reported concentrationsfor hazardous organics detected in the petitioned waste. The concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene, naphthalene, and phenol in the sixcomposite samples collected in April 1984 were presented in the petitionon a dry weight basis. Because, for delisting purposes, the Agency evaluateswastes in their as-disposed condition, the concentrations of these threeconstituents were re-calculated on a wet weight basis using percent solidsdata to account for the water that is normally present in the waste.

The Agency reviews a petitioner'sestimates and, on occasion, has requested a petitioner to re-evaluate estimatedwaste volume. EPA accepts BSC's certified estimate of 170,000 cubic yards. EPA does not generally verify submitted test data before proposing delistingdecisions, and has not verified the data upon which it proposes to denyBSC's petition. The sworn affidavit submitted with this petition bindsthe petitioner to present truthful and accurate results. The Agency, however,has a spot-check sampling and analysis program to verify the representativenature of data for some percentage of the submitted petitions, and mayselect facilities likely to be proposed for exclusion for spot-check sampling.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Agency Evaluation </ITAG>The Agency considered the appropriateness of alternative disposal scenariosfor ammonia still lime sludges and solid wastes (such as those BSC co-disposedwith the ammonia still lime sludges) and decided that a landfill scenariois the most reasonable, worst-case scenario for the petitioned waste. Undera landfill disposal scenario, the major exposure route of concern for anyhazardous constituents would be ingestion of contaminated ground water.The Agency evaluated the petitioned waste using its vertical and horizontalspread (VHS) landfill model which predicts the potential for ground-watercontamination from wastes that are landfilled. See 50 FR 7882 (February26, 1985), 50 FR 48896 (November 27, 1985), and the RCRA public docketfor these notices for a detailed description of the VHS model and its parameters.This modeling approach, which includes a ground-water transport scenario,was used with conservative, generic parameters to predict reasonable worst-casecontaminant levels in ground water at a hypothetical receptor well (i.e.,the model estimates the ability of an aquifer to dilute the toxicant froma specific volume of waste). In addition, the Agency used its Organic Leachate Model (OLM) to estimatethe leachable portion of the organic constituents in the petitioned waste.See fig. 48953 (November 27, 1985), 51 FR 41084 (November 13, 1986), andthe RCRA public docket for these notices for a detailed description ofthe OLM and its parameters. The results of the OLM analysis were used inconjunction with the VHS model to estimate the potential impact of organicconstituents on the underlying aquifer. The Agency requests comments onthe use of the OLM and VHS model as applied to the evaluation of BSC'swastes.Specifically, the Agency used the VHS model to evaluate the mobility ofthe EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide detected in the EP extract ofBSC's waste. The Agency's evaluation, using BSC's estimated waste volumeof 170,000 cubic yards per year and the maximum reported EP leachate concentrations,generated the compliance-point concentrations shown in Table 3. The Agency did not evaluate the mobility of silver from BSC's waste becauseit was not detected in the EP extract using the appropriate analyticaltest method (see Table 1). The Agency believes that it is inappropriateto evaluate non-detectable concentrations of a constituent of concern inits modeling efforts if the non-detectable value was obtained using theappropriate analytical method. If a constituent cannot be detected (whenusing the appropriate analytical method), the Agency assumes that the constituentis not present and therefore does not present a threat to either humanhealth or the environment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,6.4,7.3</C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>VHS Model: Compliance-Point Concentrations (ppm) Landfill Waste  </T4><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Compliance-point concentrations </H1><H1>Levels of regulatory concern \1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>0.005 </D><D>0.05 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>0.23 </D><D>1.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>0.002 </D><D>0.01 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.023 </D><D>0.05 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.26 </D><D>0.05 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.0001 </D><D>0.002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.094 </D><D>0.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>0.001 </D><D>0.01 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide <D>0.019 </D><D>0.7 </D><F>\1\ See ``Docket Report on Health-based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The petitioned waste exhibited lead concentrations at the compliance pointthat exceed the Agency's health-based level of 0.05 ppm used in delistingdecision-making. The leachable lead concentrations in 4 of 19 landfillwaste samples failed the VHS model evaluation. The petitioned waste exhibitedarsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, selenium, and cyanidelevels at the compliance point below the health-based levels used in delistingdecision-making. Because the maximum reported concentration of total cyanidein the waste is 43.1 ppm, the Agency believes that the concentration ofreactive cyanide will be below the Agency's interim standard of 250 ppm.See ``Interim Agency Thresholds for Toxic Gas Generation,'' July 12, 1985,Internal Agency Memorandum in the RCRA public docket. Furthermore, becausethe total constituent concentration of sulfide in the waste is 0.15 ppm,the Agency believes that the concentration of reactive sulfide will bebelow the Agency's interim standard of 500 ppm. See ``Interim Agency Thresholdsfor Toxic Gas Generation,'' July 12, 1985, Internal Agency Memorandum inthe RCRA public docket. In addition, the Agency does not believe that BSC'swaste exhibits any of the characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity,or reactivity. See 40 CFR 261.21, 261.22, and 261.23, respectively. The Agency also used the VHS model to evaluate the mobility of the hazardousorganic constituents that are potentially present in the waste. The Agencyused the OLM to predict leachable concentrations of the hazardous organicsthat were detected in the waste. The resulting leachable concentrationsand BSC's estimate of 170,000 cubic yards of accumulated waste were usedas inputs in the VHS model in order to assess the potential impacts ofthese constituents upon the ground water. The calculated compliance-pointconcentrations for these organic constituents are presented in Table 4.As stated previously, the Agency will not evaluate non-detectable concentrationsof a constituent of concern in its modeling efforts if the non-detectablevalue was obtained using the appropriate analytical method.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>TABLE</T4> 4._ <T4>OLM/VHS Model: Compliance-Point Concentrations (ppm) Landfill Waste </T4><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Compliance-point concentrations </H1><H1>Levels of regulatory concern \1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Benzo(a)pyrene <D>0.00002 </D><D>0.000003 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene <D>0.00l </D><D>14.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenols <D>0.0096 </D><D>1.0 </D><F>\1\See ``Docket Report on Health-based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The petitioned waste, when evaluated using the OLM and VHS model, exhibitedbenzo(a)pyrene concentrations at the compliance point that exceed the Agency'shealth-based level of 0.000003 ppm for benzo(a)pyrene. Benzo(a)pyrene concentrationsin 6 of 12 landfill waste samples failed the OLM/VHS model evaluation.The petitioned waste exhibited naphthalene and phenol concentrations atthe compliance point below levels of regulatory concern. The Agency also reviewed BSC's demonstration concerning the presence ofhazardous constituents (<T3>e.g.</T3>, those listed in 40 CFR Part 261, Appendix VIII) in the petitionedwaste. BSC chose to demonstrate that certain hazardous constituents werenot present in the waste by analyzing the waste for a specific set of indicatorparameters (<T3>i.e.</T3>, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, cyanide, naphthalene, phenols,and tetrachloroethylene). This set of indicator parameters is the set of``indicator'' toxic organic pollutants established by the EPA for regulatingiron and steel wastewaters under 40 CFR Part 420 (effluent limitation guidelinesand standards for the iron and steel manufacturing point source category).These six indicator parameters were chosen (by the National Pollutant DischargeElimination System (NPDES) permit program) to reduce analytical testingrequirements for 29 organic and 6 non-organic pollutants known to be presentin coke-making wastewaters. Specifically, benzene was selected as an indicatorfor the presence of volatile organic constituents, phenols to indicatethe presence of acid extractable organic constituents, and naphthaleneand benzo(a)pyrene to indicate the presence of base/neutral organic constituents.See the ``Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines andStandards for the Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category,''(EPA 440/1-82/024), May 1982. BSC claims that these six indicator parameterscould potentially be present in the petitioned waste because the wastesplaced in the landfill originated from the treatment of wastewaters fromvarious iron and steel processes (<T3>i.e.,</T3> coke-making, iron-making, steel-making, and cold finishing).BSC further claims that because the indicator parameters are absent oronly present at low levels in the petitioned waste it would be reasonableto conclude that other constituents likely to be present in the waste,specifically the remaining 29 constituents identified by the Agency tobe present in coke-making wastewaters, would also be absent or only presentin the petitioned waste at levels below regulatory concern. BSC concludes,therefore, that further analyses for hazardous constituents is unnecessary.The Agency concluded, after reviewing BSC's demonstration, that the rationalefor selecting the indicator parameters was insufficient to demonstratethat the waste contains no other hazardous constituents. The NPDES permitprogram requires continuous monitoring of wastes discharged. The testingparameters in permits are based on the waste to be discharged and treatmentstandards set for the types of processes generating the wastes. Thus, ifthe results of indicator parameter testing for a specific waste show elevatedlevels, further analyses can be conducted, modifications to the permitfor the waste can be made, and/or enforcement action can be taken. Unlikethe NPDES permit program, the Agency, in order to exclude BSC's petitionedwaste from hazardous waste regulation, especially on a one-time basis,must be assured that the waste does not contain significant levels of anyhazardous constituents potentially present in the waste. As a result, theAgency's decision must be based on a constituent-specific basis, not justindicator parameters. Furthermore, because delisting health-based levelsfor hazardous constituents are derived on a constituent-specific basisand because hazardous constituents are evaluated on a constituent-specificbasis, the Agency maintains that, to evaluate BSC's petition, constituent-specificanalytical data are necessary to quantify the actual presence or absenceof hazardous constituents potentially present in the landfill waste (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the remaining 29 constituents present in coke-making wastewaters).In addition, as previously noted, benzo(a)pyrene levels in the waste areof regulatory concern in  the petitioned waste. Thus, the Agency does notbelieve that BSC, using its indicator approach, completely demonstratedthat other hazardous base/neutral organic constituents are not presentbelow delisting levels of concern. The Agency did not request that BSCprovide further information about additional hazardous constituents inthe landfill waste because sufficient data existed to support a proposeddenial of the petition. The Agency reviewed the ground-water monitoring data available for BSC'slandfill. Data from the analysis of samples collected from the existingground-water monitoring system at the landfill indicate that the petitionedunit may have contributed to ground-water contamination. Table 5 presentsthe hazardous constituents which were detected at concentrations exceedingthe delisting health-based levels in ground-water samples collected fromwells downgradient of the landfill. Although the contaminants listed in Table 5 have also been reported inBSC's designated upgradient well (MW-2Ul), the Agency concluded that ground-watercontamination in the vicinity of the ammonia still bottoms landfill maybe due, at least in part, to the petitioned unit. Specifically, concentrationsof more than one of the contaminants listed in Table 5 are greater in adesignated downgradient well than in the upgradient well (MW-2Ul). In addition,the upgradient well's close proximity to the landfill, the low hydraulicgradient across the landfill, and fluctuations in ground-water flow causedby Lake Erie (located approximately 200 feet from the landfill) suggestthat the upgradient well may intercept flow from the landfill. The contaminationobserved in the upgradient well, therefore, may result from migration ofconstituents from the landfill. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>5._<T4>Selected Ground-water Monitoring Data (ppm) </T4><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Levels of regulatory concern\2\ </H1><H1>Monitoring wells\1\ </H1><H2>MW-2U1 </H2><H2>MW-2D2 </H2><H2>MW-2D3 </H2><H2>MW-2D4 </H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene <D>0.005 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">7-86 \3\ <D> </D><D>NR </D><D>NR </D><D>0.021 </D><D>NR </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">11-6-87 (NYDEC) <D> </D><D>0.029 </D><D>NR </D><D>0.036 </D><D>NR </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">11-6-87 <D> </D><D>0.023 </D><D>andless;0.005* </D><D>0.036/ </D><D>0.041</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12"> </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>0.031** </D><ITAG tagnum="2">1-88 <D> </D><D>0.028 </D><D>andless;0.005 </D><D>0.039 </D><D>0.018 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>0.002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">7-86 <D> </D><D>NR </D><D>NR </D><D>0.021 </D><D>NR </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">11-6-87 (NYDEC) <D> </D><D>0.039J </D><D>NR </D><D>0.015J </D><D>NR </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">11-6-87 <D> </D><D>0.045 </D><D>andless;0.010* </D><D>0.021/ </D><D>0.051</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12"> </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>0.024**  </D><ITAG tagnum="2">1-88 <D> </D><D>0.039 </D><D>andless;0.010 </D><D>0.020 </D><D>0.033 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2Barium <D>I.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">6-85 <D> </D><D>NR </D><D>0.920 </D><D>0.670 </D><D>1.06 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fluorene <D>0.002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">7-86 <D> </D><D>NR </D><D>NR </D><D>0.022 </D><D>NR </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">11-6-87 (NYDEC) <D> </D><D>0.036J </D><D>NR </D><D>0.016J </D><D>NR </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">11-6-87 <D> </D><D>0.037 </D><D>andless;0.010* </D><D>0.019/ </D><D>0.023</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12"> </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>0.021**  </D><ITAG tagnum="2">1-88 <D> </D><D>0.035 </D><D>andless;0.010* </D><D>0.020 </D><D>0.018 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Anthracene <D>0.002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">7-86 <D> </D><D>NR </D><D>NR </D><D>0.0027 </D><D>NR </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">11-6-87 <D> </D><D>0.010 </D><D>andless;0.010 </D><D>andless;0.010*/</D><D>andless;0.010*</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12"> </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>andless;0.010** </D><ITAG tagnum="2">1-88 <D> </D><D>andless;0.010* </D><D>andless;0.010 </D><D>andless;0.010* </D><D>andless;0.010* </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane <D>0.00038 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">6-12-86 <D> </D><D>andless;0.001 </D><D>andless;0.001 </D><D>0.001 </D><D>andless;0.001 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">lI-6-87 (NYDEC) <D> </D><D>0.0075 </D><D>NR </D><D>0.0029J </D><D>NR </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">11-6-87 <D> </D><D>0.006 </D><D>andless;0.005 </D><D>andless;0.005*/ </D><D>andless;0.005</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12"> </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>andless;0.005**  </D><ITAG tagnum="2">1-88 <D> </D><D>0.005 </D><D>andless;0.005* </D><D>andless;0.005* </D><D>andless;0.005* </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,6-Trichlorophenol <D>0.0018 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">6-12-86 <D> </D><D>0.010 </D><D>andless;0.0I0 </D><D>0.0I0 </D><D>andless;0.010 </D><F>\1\ Well MW-2U1 is an upgradient well; Wells MW-2D2, MW-2D3, and MW-2D4are downgradient wells </F><F>\2\ See ``Docket Report on Health-based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket. </F><F>\3\ All values reported by BSC unless otherwise noted. </F><F>NR_Not reported. </F><F>andless;_Denotes that the constituent was not detected at the detectionlimit specified in the table. </F><F>J_Estimated value. </F><F>*_Compound present below measurable detection limit. </F><F>**_Values represent the results of replicate sample analyses. </F><F>  NYDEC_Value reported by New York Department of Environmental Control.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">5. Conclusion </ITAG>The Agency believes that BSC has not demonstrated that its petitioned wasteis not hazardous. The Agency considers the sampling and analysis programconducted in support of the petition to be incomplete. The Agency is awarethat the samples collected from the landfill may not be completely representativeof all of the waste contained in the landfill; however, the Agency believesthat the samples are representative of at least a portion of the petitionedwaste. The Agency's evaluation of analytical data provided by BSC indicatethat the landfill waste exhibits significant concentrations of leachablelead and benzo(a)pyrene. Further, the Agency believes that a more completecharacterization of hazardous constituent concentrations in the petitionedwaste might demonstrate that the waste contains hazardous levels of additionaltoxicants, including those detected in the ground water. In addition, ground-watermonitoring data collected for wells monitoring the on-site landfill indicatethat the landfill waste may be adversely impacting ground-water qualityat the site. The Agency, therefore, proposes to deny Bethlehem Steel Corporation'spetition for exclusion of its ammonia still lime sludge described in itspetition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. K060 and contained in its landfillat its Lackawanna, New York facility. This waste should continue to besubject to regulation under 40 CFR Parts 260 through 268 and the permittingstandards of 40 CFR Part 270. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Effective Date </ITAG>This rule, if promulgated, will become effective immediately. The Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allowrules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated communitydoes not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is thecase here, because this rule, if promulgated, would not change the existingrequirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. This facility hasbeen obligated to manage its waste as hazardous before and during the Agency'sreview of its petition. Because a six-month deadline is not necessary toachieve the purpose of Section 3010, EPA believes that this denial shouldbe effective immediately upon promulgation. These reasons also providea basis for making this rule effective immediately, upon promulgation,under the Administrative Procedures Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.The proposed denial of this petition, if promulgated, would not imposean economic burden on this facility because prior to submitting and duringreview of the petition, this facility should have continued to handle itswaste as hazardous. The denial of the petition means that they are to continuemanaging their waste as hazardous in the manner in which they have beendoing, economically, and otherwise. There is no additional economic impact,therefore, due to today's rule. This proposal is not a major regulation,therefore, no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e., </T3>small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. This amendment, if promulgated, will not have an adverse economic impacton small entities. The facility included in this notice does not constitutea small entity. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this proposed regulation,if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not requirea regulatory flexibility analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with thisproposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub.L. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et. seq.</T3>) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0053.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
