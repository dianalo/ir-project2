First, she dons a white lace corset and matching panties. Then, the blond, 33-year-old mother of two climbs onto the bed. She curls into a seductive pose, pouts and purrs &quot;Hi.&quot;    &quot;Beautiful,&quot; the photographer says. Click.    &quot;Now, give me a big smile.&quot; Click.    &quot;Perfect.&quot; Click.    Mr. Opp is going to be a very happy man when he finds out about this little session -- or, at least, that's what his wife hopes. On their 10th anniversary, she is giving her husband a gift she figures he will treasure forever: a scorchingly sexy portrait of herself.    Forget old-fashioned aphrodisiacs like oysters and powdered rhinoceros horn. Boudoir photographs are the hottest new item on the market for lovers looking to rev up a romance. Women, men and even couples are leaping at the chance to shed their clothes and pose. These sessions aren't inexpensive. But those who have indulged say it is money well spent.    Posing nearly nude was a big thrill for Mrs. Opp, who describes herself as &quot;a mother and a homemaker&quot; who also works as a bookkeeper at her husband's commercial-art business. &quot;Being a model for a day is kind of neat,&quot; she adds.    Toni Furlong, a 30-year-old housewife from Las Vegas, says her session in front of the lens fulfilled &quot;a tiny, tiny fantasy of being this month's centerfold.&quot; Mrs. Furlong says her husband was so happy with the photos that he not only tacked them up all over the house, he also showed them off to the neighbors.    Photographer Steven Palen, who took the photos of Mrs. Furlong at his studio in Las Vegas, says sexy photos can help a tired relationship. He recalls the time a woman posed for him, hoping the photos would revive her eight-year marriage. When she brought her husband in to see the finished prints, he was overcome with emotion, Mr. Palen says.    &quot;The sucker had tears in his eyes,&quot; Mr. Palen says, &quot;It was fantastic.&quot;    For those handy with a camera, boudoir photography can be a big money-maker -- and a pleasant diversion from the humdrum wedding and portrait business. Boudoir photography is &quot;the fastest-growing segment of the portrait-photography business,&quot; says Galen R. Metz, who conducted a survey of industry trends among 200 professional photographers on the West Coast for Eastman Kodak Co. in 1986.    Rodolfo I. Pollack of Queens in New York City says he started taking intimate portraits three years ago; now, they account for 15% of his business, he says. Stuart Naideth, who photographed Mrs. Opp at his studio here, says last year he pulled in about $320,000 from boudoir photography alone. On the average, he charges $900 for a sitting and the prints. (Mr. Naideth keeps the negatives, as most professional photographers do.)    Personal intimate photographs aren't new, by any means. Lots of sexy snapshots of sweethearts went overseas during World War II, for instance. But as professional portraiture, boudoir photography began to catch on only about five years ago. It first took off in the West.    Among the earliest to cash in on the trend were Robert and Carla Calkins, who have a studio in Placerville, Calif., a tiny logging and tourist town outside Sacramento. The Calkinses say they had no trouble finding customers even in a town with a population of 7,000. &quot;People are looking for a real special gift they can give someone they love,&quot; Mrs. Calkins says. The couple recently has opened two more studios in the area.    Not all subjects naturally come off looking like a centerfold. So boudoir photographers have devised a number of tricks to help transform even the plainest Janes into sloe-eyed beauties.    Some slim down the Rubenesque customers by posing them on a soft mattress or a foam pad. That allows chubby derrieres or flabby upper arms to sink out of the view of the camera. Other unsightly features can be shaded with lighting.    Some photographers hide nature's mistakes with a strategically draped feather boa or a satin sheet. The photos also can be liberally retouched so that stretch marks, blemishes and facial puffiness magically vanish.    Getting the subject to loosen up can be a challenge. A glass of wine and some mood-setting music often get things started. The professional boudoir photographer is &quot;loving, caring and sensitive,&quot; but totally professional, says Mr. Palen. &quot;Picking up girls isn't what this is all about,&quot; he says. &quot;What we sell isn't a naked picture, it's love.&quot;    Audrey M. Revell, a 64-year-old photographer in San Francisco, has a more direct way of priming her subjects. &quot;I just tell them, 'Honey, I want you to think of the hottest man you've ever met,'&quot; she says. &quot;It works every time.&quot;    For somewhat more modest subjects, boudoir photographers also offer what they call &quot;glamour shots.&quot; These may feature a daring bit of cleavage or some other racy touch, but they leave a lot more to the imagination. Judy Armstrong, a 39-year-old health-care consultant in San Francisco, elected such an approach when she hired Ms. Revell.    Concerned that lingerie mightn't flatter her 180 pound, 5-foot-2-inch frame, Ms. Armstrong wore a strapless evening gown. But the final pictures, a gift for her boyfriend, were enticing enough to boost her ego as well.    &quot;There gets to be a point in your life when you want to know if you still have it,&quot; she says. &quot;This is a validation to yourself that you can still look good and that you still can be sexy.&quot;    In Laguna Beach, Calif., Cheryl J. Maneff is making a handsome living taking libidinous shots of men. She calls the style &quot;dude-oir.&quot; Testimony to her theory that &quot;a girl likes to look at a good-looking guy as much as a guy likes to look at a good-looking girl&quot; is 29-year-old Joseph F. Wells.    Mr. Wells, the muscular co-owner of an athletic-wear company, likes to give sexy photos of himself to girlfriends. He has posed several times in tank tops and towels during the last three years. For one session, he outfitted himself like Rambo, with bandanna, vest and a pretty authentic-looking machine gun.    His former girlfriends &quot;are probably all throwing darts at {the pictures} now,&quot; he says. But he keeps going back because posing makes him feel &quot;like a star.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
