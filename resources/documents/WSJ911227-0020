Prices for oil and natural gas aredepressed, and the mood in Calgary is glum.   Everywhere, that is, except at the offices of CanadianOccidental Petroleum Inc., thanks to the company's 52% stakein an oil field in Yemen.</LP><TEXT>   Canadian Oxy's stock has been a stellar performer, nearlydoubling to an American Stock Exchange peak of 22 earlierthis year on reports of successful Yemen drilling programs.Although the stock recently stumbled, bulls predict it willchalk up further gains by mid-1992 as new test results comein from ongoing drilling on the Masila field. The stock wasquoted late yesterday on the Amex at 21 3/8, up 1/4; it alsotrades in Toronto.   Already, Canadian Oxy and its partners have reportedestimated recoverable reserves of 235 million barrels on partof the field, based on results of three wells. Thatdisappointed some investors, who'd been expecting 500 millionbarrels in recoverable reserves based upon statements by thegovernment of Yemen and Occidental Petroleum Corp. of LosAngeles, which holds a 48% stake in Canadian Oxy.   Though the Canadian company isn't talking -- it seems tobe actively discouraging speculation -- bulls on the stockare guessing that there might be as much as a billion barrelsof recoverable oil in Canadian Oxy's Yemeni field.   &quot;I believe they have about 500 million barrels there,based on the structures that they have explored -- and thereare more structures still to explore,&quot; said Don Whatley, ananalyst with Bunting Warburg in Toronto. &quot;Depending on theadditional news that comes from the drilling they're doingnow, I can see this stock moving up to $30 {Canadian, orUS$25.85} a share next year,&quot; from a recent C$24.50.   &quot;Yemen is one of the fastest-growing sources of crude oilexports in the world right now,&quot; says Wilf Gobert, an analystwith Peters andamp; Co., a Calgary investment dealer specializingin the oil industry. &quot;The reserves report allowed people tofocus on the uncertainty of producing there, and they optedto sell on the news just as they'd bought on the rumor.&quot;   Hunt Oil Co. of Dallas, currently producing from a fieldin the northern part of the country, is one of the few otherNorth American concerns involved in Yemen. Hunt's field isreported to be an &quot;elephant,&quot; a large discovery with aboutone billion barrels of oil recoverable -- and that's whatCanadian Oxy's shareholders hope its Masila field willbecome. Aggressive drilling is under way, with three rigsworking on exploratory and development wells on newstructures that could add to reserves. Analysts say that thetwo largest finds to date have come from the Camaal block andthat finds on other structures could help boost reserves --and the stock price -- significantly.   In the midst of all the speculation, Canadian Oxy'sexecutives have remained cautious. They bowed out of apreviously scheduled presentation at an oil and gasconference sponsored by the American Stock Exchange earlierthis year, leading to speculation that they didn't want totalk about Yemen. When the Yemen government announced thatone of the Canadian Oxy discovery wells was the largest inthe country's history, with a flow of more than 10,000barrels a day, the company promptly issued a press releasesaying it couldn't confirm figures. But in fact, LarryMurphy, Canadian Oxy's vice president, corporate affairs,says one well has tested at a flow rate of 10,000 barrelswith a second well testing at 12,000 barrels. &quot;We hopethere's a lot more out there,&quot; he said.   Analysts note that the 24-inch pipeline Canadian Oxy andits partners plan to build to ship oil to a coastal exportterminal is very large for the 120,000 barrels of oil dailyCanadian Oxy said are expected to be shipped through itbeginning in late 1993.   There remain some skeptics in Canada's investmentcommunity. &quot;This stock is fully valued right where it is,&quot;contends Denis Mote, an analyst with Maisons Placements inToronto. &quot;The current price reflects about 500 millionbarrels recoverable. Besides, while the flow rates on thesewells are great, who knows if they're sustainable whencommercial production begins?&quot;   Bulls aren't deterred. &quot;The concession is very large, andthe company is only a year into their drilling program,&quot; saysMr. Gobert. &quot;Given their early and high rate of success, I'dbe surprised not to see some more good news. There's still alot of upside to this stock.&quot;   George Domolkoy, of Fidelity Investments' Canada Fund,says he's generally pessimistic about prospects for Canada'senergy industry next year; still, he &quot;might want to take alook at&quot; Canadian Oxy.   ---   Canadian Occidental Pete                                                                                                          Business: Oil and gas exploration and development;chemicals                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1990:   Revenue: $550.2 million   Net Income: $40.6 million; 61 cents a share                                                                                                          Third quarter, Sept. 30, 1991:   Per-share net income: 11 cents vs. 16 cents                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume:   8,214 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 66.7 million*                                                                                                          Note: All figures in Canadian dollars.   *48% owned by Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
