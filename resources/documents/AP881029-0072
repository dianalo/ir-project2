Voted into office last week by less than 3 percent of thetownship's 1 million adults, the council must deal with a 2-year-oldrent boycott and a 4-month-old strike by municipal workers.   Thirty of the 35 incumbent councilors, including Mayor NelsonBotile, were ousted in Wednesday's election. All but one of the 30new councilors belong to the Sofasonke Party, headed by former mayorEphraim Tshabalala, a businessman. His son, Mbutana, is favored tobe selected by the new council as Botile's successor.   But the 11{ percent voter turnout was so low the victors canscarcely claim a mandate. Only 28,993 Sowetans disregarded anationwide boycott call from anti-apartheid leaders and voted in theelections.   The low turnout followed a multimillion-dollar governmentadvertising campaign in which cartoon-character squirrels urgedvoters to ``Make It Happen.''   The outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, in astatement issued Saturday in Lusaka, Zambia, said blacks had``rejected the apartheid local elections with contempt.'' It urgednewly-elected councilors to resign from their ``collaborativestructures ... and join the ranks of the people.''   By law and custom, South Africa maintains a system of apartheidunder which its 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs,which are controlled by the 5 million whites.   The city council faces two major crises _ a widespread rentboycott and a strike by municipal workers whose promised payincreases have been delayed because of the boycott.   The rent boycott started in a group of townships south ofJohannesburg in 1985 and spread to Soweto in June 1986. It waslaunched to press a variety of political demands, including liftinga national state of emergency, withdrawing security forces fromblack townships and releasing political prisoners.   Authorities have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in rent andservice fees during the boycott. An estimated two-thirds of Soweto'shouseholds are withholding rent.   In June, about 3,500 Soweto municipal workers went on strike,irked by the postponement of pay increases and by demands that theyhelp break the rent boycott.   About 2,000 strikers have been fired. Those who went back to workare mostly office clerks and administrators.   Services disrupted by the strike, such as garbage collection andsewage-system repairs, have resumed on an irregular basis, but largepiles of trash line many of the unpaved streets.   During the election campaign, Sofasonke leaders made sweepingpromises to rehire the strikers, improve services, lower rents andhalt evictions of rent boycotters.   The Sowetan, the main daily newspaper in the township, attributedthe Sofasonke Party's success to support from ``the old, theunemployed, the homeless and the sickly. The party's organizationalmachinery saw to it that voters were well-fed and properly bused toelection posts.   ``Whether the party fulfills its promises ... remains to be seen.Black councilors still have a long way to go before being fullyaccepted by residents.''</TEXT></DOC>
