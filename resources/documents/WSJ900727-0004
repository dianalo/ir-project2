Karene Witcher   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/27/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B3B</SO><CO>   NWS</CO><IN>MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)</IN><LP>   SYDNEY, Australia -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. isnearing the time when it customarily raises the value of itsassets, an exercise that supported acquisitions in itsempire-building past. Now, however, that revaluation practiceis part of the debt-laden media giant's efforts to shore upits finances.   Every three years, News Corp. revalues its publishingrights, television licenses and titles. Analysts who trackthe company expect it to write up the value of some of itsassets by a total of about 1 billion Australian dollars(US$797.5 million). That's roughly the same Australian dollarincrease as in the 1987 revaluation, though because the baseamounts have grown, the expected write-up translates into asmaller percentage increase in shareholders' equity.</LP><TEXT>   Richard Sarazen, a News Corp. director, says therevaluation &quot;is a policy we established six or seven yearsago.&quot; The company has been particularly tight-lipped aboutthe size of the latest planned revaluation, and Mr. Sarazendeclines to comment beyond saying, &quot;We won't know the finalnumbers until mid-August,&quot; when News Corp. will releaseresults for its 1990 financial year, ended June 30.   In the past, the revaluation helped fuel the company'srapid, debt-financed global expansion, often to thedisadvantage of U.S. competitors, who must adhere to stricteraccounting standards. Although most of News Corp.'s assetsare outside Australia, under Australian accounting rules thecompany can periodically write up the value of certain assetsif its directors think the assets are worth more than thepurchase price. That practice, in turn, increases holders'equity -- and News Corp.'s borrowing power.   These days, though, the company, which is off theacquisition trail, is depending on the revaluation as adefensive tactic to reduce its leverage. Despite a flurry ofasset sales since March to further that reduction, thecompany's debt is estimated to have ballooned to A$9 billionfrom A$5.4 billion in 1988. The estimate excludes preferenceshares that if counted as debt would raise the total to aboutA$10 billion. And it doesn't take into account any financialliability News Corp. might bear for its 50%-owned domesticairline, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., or itsjoint-venture aircraft-leasing company, Ansett WorldwideAviation Services.   Meanwhile, Mr. Murdoch could be forced to write downcertain of his U.S. assets, some analysts warn. And inAustralia, relatively high domestic interest rates areputting pressure on asset values. The Australian governmentalso is maintaining a hard line on foreign ownership of thecountry's newspapers, which could hold down the value ofthose assets.   In broadcast media, the government recently restrictedforeign ownership to 15% by any one party and a 20% total forany company, but Australia hasn't any such legislated policyon newspapers. However, a spokesman for Treasurer PaulKeating, who is the final arbiter on foreign investment, saysthe government intends to hold total foreign ownership in anyAustralian newspaper below 15%.   The Labor Party government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke hasspurned several overtures from foreigners who want to takebig stakes in local newspapers. The latest rebuff came inJune when British publisher Robert Maxwell proposed toacquire 49% of the daily West Australian in Perth.   Mr. Murdoch controls News Corp., which accounts for about60% of Australia's newspaper sales. The Australia-bornentrepreneur changed his citizenship to American in 1985 tocomply with U.S. television-ownership rules. But Mr. Hawkesays Mr. Murdoch, the son of one of Australia's most famousreporters, is a special case because he &quot;started off as anAussie&quot; and isn't considered a foreigner.   Mr. Sarazen discounts the potential impact of foreignownership limits on News Corp.'s Australian media assets. Butanalysts and bankers, who say the limits could make it moredifficult to write up those assets in the future, raise thespecter that their current value could be eroded.   Restricting newspaper ownership &quot;will rule out a lot ofbuyers,&quot; says Viktor Shvets, who tracks News Corp. for BaringSecurities Ltd. Consequently, he says, &quot;It will have adetrimental impact on the value of the asset backing.&quot;   Moreover, Mr. Shvets says News Corp. could come underpressure to write down some of its investment in TrianglePublications Inc., a U.S. publisher whose crown jewel is TVGuide. In 1988, News Corp. paid US$3 billion for TrianglePublications, a figure Mr. Shvets thinks was much too high.   Based on analysts' projections, if News Corp. revalues itsassets by A$1 billion, that will increase shareholders'equity by less than 15%, to A$8.2 billion, excludingpreference shares; that compares with 1987's revaluation thatincreased shareholders' equity by 25%, to A$4.9 billion.   George Batsakis, an analyst at the Melbourne brokeragefirm J.B. Were andamp; Son, is looking for an increase on assetvaluations, including News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co. andFox TV stations in the U.S. and at Herald andamp; Weekly TimesLtd., an Australian newspaper company that News Corp.acquired in 1987 for A$2.3 billion.   News Corp. has raised about A$1 billion from asset salessince March, including the sale of 49% of its Hong Kong-basedSouth China Morning Post newspaper. But News Corp. also hadto bring its book-publishing arm, Harper Collins PublishersInc. -- and its estimated A$700 million debt -- onto itsbooks during the year ended June 30.   According to Baring Securities estimates, News Corp. endedits 1990 financial year with debt of A$9 billion and totalequity of A$9.5 billion, including A$1.2 billion inconvertible notes and A$1.3 billion in preference shares.That gives News Corp. a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.95 to 1,well below the 1.1 to 1 that News Corp.'s bank lendersstipulate must exist every year on June 30.   Meanwhile, some analysts are slashing their earningsforecasts on News Corp. Last month, investment bank MorganStanley andamp; Co. cut its 1990 earnings estimate after tax, butbefore extraordinary items, to A$215 million, or 76Australian cents a share, from A$250 million, or 86 cents ashare. News Corp. earned A$496 million, or A$1.58 a share, inthe year ended June 30, 1989.   Carla Bakker, the investment bank's London-based analyst,still has a buy recommendation on the stock, but she iscutting her estimates mainly because of &quot;lower earnings thanexpected in the U.S., due to the slowdown in advertisinggrowth which is affecting the company's magazines, newspapersand TV stations.&quot;   While she says the overall outlook on News Corp. is&quot;promising,&quot; she also trimmed her profit estimates for fiscal1991 to A$490 million, or A$1.56 a share, from A$510 million,or A$1.62 a share.   J.B. Were's Mr. Batsakis is looking for an estimated A$250million, or 84 cents a share, for the year just ended andA$390 million, or A$1.21 a share, next year. With NewsCorp.'s share price climbing above A$12, Baring Securitiessays the stock is &quot;a little expensive.&quot; In the currentlytight international credit environment, News Corp. is facedwith selling assets to finance its funding commitments, butthe cash-flow base will expand to meet those needs if thecompany &quot;can buy itself a grace period of 12 to 18 months,&quot;Baring said in a recent report.   Still, Baring's Mr. Shvets expects News Corp. to &quot;emergein the next two years as a much leaner and more concentratedvehicle, with greater emphasis on the broadcasting side ofthe business&quot; including Sky Television, the company'sfledgling British satellite-TV service. Mr. Murdoch now saysSky TV should break even by late 1991 or early 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
