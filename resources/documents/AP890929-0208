Criticism of two aspects of the bill just passed by the Houseare bound to make their way into discussions in the Senate.   First of them is the absence of any inflation adjustment forexisting asset-holders. Next is the two-year limitation on thereduction.   Almost forgotten in such discussions will be an awareness of theostensible reason for the cut, which is to provide the federalgovernment with more revenue rather than to do favors for certainconstituencies.   As passed by the House, the capital gains tax bill would lowerto 19.6 percent the highest tax bracket for capital gains, whichare the financial rewards of long-term investments _ equities,stocks, real estate and the like.   Most people with capital gains now pay 28 percent to 33 percent.Those less well off also may have important capital gains,political oratory notwithstanding. Their tax would drop to 10.5percent from 15 percent.   These percentages, however, would last just two years, afterwhich the tax would return to 28 percent and 15 percent.Thereafter, capital investments would be indexed to wring out thefalse profit of inflation.   By this means, it is hoped, individuals will be encouraged tosell their investments now gathering dust, at which time they willbe compelled to pay capital gains taxes, which are assessed onlyafter the assets are sold.   It is generally believed that many people have been holding onto their assets because they cannot afford to sell and pay the tax.Not just the very rich either. Some ordinary folks have seen theirmoney expand 10 times in 20 years.   No doubt, some of these people will view the two-year period asa rare opportunity, and so will take the cash, pay the tax andreinvest in something more in keeping with their current lifestyle. Uncle Sam's revenues will rise.   However, there is less certainty on another contention: thatinvestors will be encouraged by lower taxes to invest in newenterprises that will grow into firms employing lots of people andpaying lots of taxes.   Criticism on this score will come from a wide variety ofsmall-business people, including venture capitalists, who alreadyare saying that two years is not enough. Capital investments arelong term, they say. Two years is not.   As they see it, if this aspect of the law is to encourageentrepreneurial investments, it must be extended by several moreyears, or even indefinitely. Two years, they say, is not enoughtime to earn a respectable profit.   Perhaps an even larger squawk could come from investors who feelthat past inflation should be deducted from their capital gains.They have a point, because inflation might account for half theirso-called profits, or even more.   It is conceivable that even with the tax deduction some peoplecould end up as losers. Such an unhappy situation could result, forexample, if the rate of inflation approached, equaled or exceededthe investment rate of return.   Logic would seem to apply to the past as well as to the future.If those with gains after 1992 are to be tax-exempted frominflation why shouldn't earlier investors be treated in the samefashion?   You might think the answer is clear cut, but it isn't. Logic isnot the issue, taxes are. The whole idea is to raise revenues, spureconomic activity and try to finance the government _ not toprovide justice.   The latter belongs to another, entirely separate branch ofgovernment.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for PMs Monday, Oct. 2.</NOTE></DOC>
