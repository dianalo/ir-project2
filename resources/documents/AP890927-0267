(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Final approval of former Ohio financierMarvin Warner's $16 million bankruptcy settlement plan was delayedWednesday because of questions over court costs, a family trust andinterest on back taxes.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George Proctor set a Nov. 19 deadline tosolve the problems.   The judge said he wants to either confirm a plan to settleWarner's personal bankruptcy case, dismiss it, convert it again toa Chapter 7 liquidation or handle it some other way under Chapter11 reorganization.   The biggest problem is a dispute with the Internal RevenueService over back taxes and interest owed by Warner.   Warner's tax attorney, Bart Brown, testified that discussionswith the IRS showed that Warner owes $2.5 million in taxes plus$3.7 million in interest for a total of $6.2 million. The IRS hasfiled a claim against Warner's estate for $13 million.   Under the proposed plan, Warner said he will pay the IRS back inyearly installments over six years. At dispute is the amount ofinterest Warner will have to pay during the period.   Also at issue is dissolving a Warner family trust containingsome of the money needed for settlement. Attorneys said they need aCircuit Court judge in Ocala to approve dissolving the trust, whichthey said could happen in under a month.   Warner also must pay legal fees ordered by the court or reach anagreement with attorneys before the next hearing.   Warner's creditors have approved the settlement and it hascleared critical court hearings in Ohio and Fort Lauderdale.   Under the proposal, Warner immediately would pay $10 million andmake three annual payments of $2 million beginning with the firstanniversary of the plan's approval.   Ohio officials said the state will accept $8 million becauseWarner can't afford the $22 million a court ordered him to pay asrestitution for bailing out his failed thift, Home State SavingsBank of Cincinnati. Creditors will divide the other $8 million.   At a hearing Monday in Fort Lauderdale, Thomas Tew, thecourt-appointed trustee representing investors of defunct ESMGovernment Securities Inc., backed the plan.   Fort Lauderdale-based ESM was closed by federal regulators inMarch 1985. Home State, which lost about $144 million in ESMinvestments, collapsed four days later and triggered a crisis amongOhio thrifts.   Tew said the ESM-related creditors will receive about $1.28million under the settlement, leaving Warner about $5 million andhis 153-acre Ocala horse farm.   Warner, 70, who was flooded with $4.5 billion in lawsuitsfollowing Home State's collapse, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcyprotection in October 1987.   Warner is appealing a felony conviction in Ohio in connectionwith the Home State collapse, but has been acquitted of federalcharges in a separate trial.</TEXT></DOC>
