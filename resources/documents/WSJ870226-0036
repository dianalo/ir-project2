Campbell said it will offer 1.25 Campbell common shares and 80 cents (Canadian) for each Meston common share, giving the proposed transaction an indicated value of about $15.1 million. The Campbell shares will carry trading restrictions for a year.    Meston currently has 8.7 million common shares outstanding. Campbell already owns about 4.2 million, or 47%, or Meston's common shares. Campbell said it also owns all of Meston's Class B shares, giving Campbell a 54% voting interest.    Campbell said its offer for the 4.5 million Meston common shares currently held by minority holders will be made within a few days. It won't apply to U.S. residents.    Campbell said the offer follows an agreement between it and the Quebec Securities Commission regarding the applicability of Quebec's rules on takeover bids. Campbell was ordered by the commission last October not to acquire further Meston shares after it acquired two million shares through the exercise of options acquired from shareholders.    The commission said it considered the purchase a public offer, and in contravention of its regulations. Campbell said the current planned offer provides equivalent consideration as that given to Meston holders under its previous purchase.    Montreal-based Meston owns the Joe Mann mine in Quebec, a copper and gold property. Campbell is a copper, precious metals, oil, gas and coal producer. In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Campbell closed at $2.05, up 15 cents, and Meston closed at $2.55, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
