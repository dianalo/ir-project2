Wearing bluecoveralls and carrying clipboard checklists, they are NissanMotor Corp. quality inspectors, flown in from Japan.   What they are finding may surprise critics of the Europeanauto industry. The cars, made in England by English-men --under British management, using parts supplied mostly byEuropean manufacturers, are equal in quality to those made byNissan in Japan. Nissan's five-year-old car-assembly planthere even matches the productivity of its Japanese plants.That means it's at least twice as efficient as the averageEuropean car plant.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In the European motor industry, there is resignation thatEurope can't do it,&quot; says John Cushnaghan, productiondirector of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (U.K.) Ltd. But, hesays: &quot;That's not so. We've done it.&quot;   This may offer scant comfort as European concern risesabout Japanese competition in a broad spectrum of products.Europe's auto makers fear not only Japanese imports but alsosuch &quot;transplant&quot; production as Nissan's and the assemblyplants being built in the U.K. by Toyota Motor Corp. andHonda Motor Co.   Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot S.A., has criticizedBritain for allowing the Japanese to build plants in theEuropean Community. Mr. Calvet and others argue thatcompetition from Japanese auto plants in Europe is unfairbecause the Japanese can afford to build modern, efficientplants on &quot;green field&quot; sites and handpick highly motivatedwork forces.   But even Mr. Calvet concedes that European regulationsbear some of the blame, and argues that French labor lawshave to be changed to allow the auto industry to prepare forcompetition with Japan. Peugeot &quot;should be able to chooseamong its personnel and fire those who don't want to work,who refuse to or are unable to be trained, and those whosimply aren't adapted to a modern automobile industry,&quot; hetold the business daily La Tribune de l'Expansion. French lawcurrently dictates that, in the event of layoffs, the firstto go must be those last hired or workers older than 56years. The latter get generous government social securitybenefits.   Meanwhile, Europe's car makers are scrambling to becomemore competitive, and nearly all have sent representatives totour the Nissan plant for ideas. But the Europeans maintainthat they can't soon afford to replace their old, inefficientplants or get out of obligations to present workers. So, thecompanies argue, they need at least a decade and hugesubsidies to catch up with the Japanese. Thus the EuropeanCommunity is seeking continued limits on sales of Japanesecars, including transplant production.   Nissan managers concede they have had advantages. &quot;Yes,starting from scratch is easier,&quot; says Mr. Cushnaghan. &quot;Butsaying that Europe has bad practices and can't get there iswrong.&quot; Some auto makers are heeding the message. TheEuropean units of Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., aswell as Sweden's AB Volvo, are moving to incorporate Japaneseideas in existing plants.   Nissan's predominantly British management team says it hadto adapt the parent company's management philosophy to localconditions. There was initial resistance among some workersto Nissan's flexible, team approach. But generally, Nissanhas succeeded here in applying the practices that have madethe Japanese auto industry the envy of the world.   &quot;Nissan's plant in the U.K. is probably the best car plantin Europe right now,&quot; says Daniel T. Jones, a professor ofmotorindustry management at Cardiff Business School. Afterpredictably operating in the red, the Sunderland plant is onschedule to break even this year and to post an operatingprofit in 1992.   The plant was designed to produce 100,000 midsizedPrimeras a year, but it has found ways -- including overtime-- to boost capacity to 120,000 this year. It's also gearingup to add a production line to turn out 100,000 Micraminicars annually, starting in August 1992.   Nissan's European operation, and the earlier creation ofits North American transplant company, fit into a strategy toreduce Nissan's exposure to political attacks and importquotas by cutting vehicle exports from Japan, expandingoverseas production under local management and increasing carimports to Japan.   At Nissan's sprawling assembly plant in Sunderland, theemphasis is on quality and on &quot;kaizen&quot;, a Japanese term thatmeans continuous improvement. The highly automated stampingplant, which each week turns 600 tons of British, French andGerman sheet metal into body panels, posts this goal ingiant, black letters: &quot;Best in the World.&quot;   Two workers inspect door panels coming off a multisteppressing line. Finding a problem, they halt production untilit can be fixed, preventing output of defective parts thatwould have to be scrapped. Similarly, the body assembly line,complete with 120 robot welders, halts frequently for minoradjustments. Along the final assembly line, a flashing alarmsummons a supervisor if any worker sees a problem.   At the end of one section, a worker inspectsundercarriages as cars on the conveyor pass overhead,watching for tags indicating minor repairs that need to bemade. For each fault he repairs, the worker drops a plasticball into a row of columns. If balls pile up for any defect,a supervisor knows that somebody needs more training or thatan assembly process needs to be refined.   The system is designed to keep defects from making theirway to the end of the assembly line. By contrast, U.S. andEuropean auto makers have emphasized keeping the assemblyline moving at all costs, with end-of-the-line inspectionsand repairs supposed to guarantee quality. But the superiorquality of Japanese cars is forcing U.S. and Europeancompanies to adopt Japanese methods.   Crucial to making its U.K. system work, Nissan says, isits carefully selected and cultivated work force. &quot;We hirethem for their brains, not just their hands,&quot; says onemanager. &quot;Our aim is to continually increase the role of theindividual.&quot;   From the beginning, Nissan has been able to select from anenormous number of job candidates: 25,000 applied for theinitial 470 jobs. Since then, applications have been runningat 40,000 a year at the plant, where the total work forceshould reach 4,000 next year. In part, that reflects Nissan'scompetitive wages and job stability in an otherwise uncertainmanufacturing sector.   One of the only serious debates that Nissan's Britishmanagers had with their Japanese bosses was over tradeunionism, says Peter Wickens, Nissan U.K.'s director ofpersonnel and a member of the board. In the U.S., Nissan tookan anti-union stance. But Mr. Wickens says he argued thatdoing so in the U.K. would make Nissan a target fororganizers.   In the end, Nissan agreed that a single union, theAmalgamated Engineering Union, would represent its workers.That gave the plant a tremendous advantage over older Britishplants, whose workers tend to be represented by numeroussmall craft unions, each with different rules and demands.And writing a labor agreement from scratch was anotheradvantage: Nissan wasn't limited by restrictive work rulesdeveloped over decades.   In setting up the Sunderland plant, there were someJapanese practices that Nissan's British managers decidedwouldn't work in the U.K., such as badges of rank, groupexercise before work shifts and singing of company songs.Given such differences, an official says, &quot;we aren't just acopy of a plant in Japan.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
