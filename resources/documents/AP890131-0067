Police say about two-thirdsof the haul is missing.   Valerio Viccei, the 34-year-old Italian who masterminded therobbery at a London safe deposit center, was sentenced to 22 yearsin jail on Monday after the two-month jury trial at London's OldBailey Central Criminal Court.   Detectives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they thoughtViccei, who had most of a month to dispose of the haul before he wasarrested, still controls much of it.   One Scotland Yard detective said: ``He is set for a verycomfortable retirement when he gets out'' of prison.   Assisted by Parvez Latiff, the 32-year-old debt-ridden owner ofthe safe deposit center, the gang broke into 120 deposit boxes onJuly 12, 1987 and stole enough valuables to fill a bathtub at theirhideout, prosecutor Roy Amlot told the jury.   Viccei and an accomplice had posed as customers at the safedeposit center across from Harrods department store in the expensiveKnightsbridge area.   Once inside, they pulled guns on security guards and on Latiff,who concealed his involvement. The gang members then spent two hoursbreaking open boxes, taking goods such as a 40-carat diamond, sincerecovered, belonging to the wife of West German industrialist GerdRudolph Flick.   One robber cried, ``Bingo,'' when he opened a box containing$265,000 worth of cocaine, the court heard.   But Viccei cut his finger on one box, took off his glove, andleft a fingerprint, which allowed police to arrest him a week beforehe planned to flee to South America.   Viccei estimated the haul was worth $70 million and detectivessaid it was worth at least $53 million.   Latiff, who had been promised one-third of the haul, wassentenced to 18 years in prison for robbery and five yearsconcurrently for possessing a gun.   One accomplice, David Poole, was given 16 years with a five-yearconcurrent sentence. Another, Peter O'Donohue, was sentenced todayto 11 years in jail. ``Some you win, some you lose,'' O'Donohue saidas he was led from the court.   Viccei also received a concurrent 12-year term for a firearmsoffense.   Police said about $17 million worth of the haul has beenrecovered. They said about $12 million worth of this will bereturned to owners but that about $5 million worth remains unclaimed.   Police think many of the mainly foreign owners may not haveclaimed items of stolen property because they want to conceal thefull extent of their wealth for political, tax or other reasons.   Once any appeals or subsequent trials have been dealt with, theunclaimed goods will be auctioned off for charity, police said.   Insurance companies have contacted detectives to authenticateclaims and losers cannot claim for more than they admitted topolice. One detective said: ``We think a lot of people have lostproperty they never told anyone about.''   Britain's previous biggest robbery was the theft of gold,platinum, diamonds and travelers checks worth a total of $46 millionfrom a Brinks Mat warehouse near London's Heathrow airport on Nov.26, 1983.   The Guinness Book of Records says the world's greatest robberywas the theft of the equivalent of $4.4 billion in present dayvalues from the Reichsbank following the collapse of Nazi Germany in1945.</TEXT></DOC>
