ALLEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Maryland lawmakers have ratified a billrequiring background checks and a seven-day waiting period forbuyers of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons.   The bill, prompted by January's schoolyard shooting inCalifornia and by an upswing in street violence involvingsemiautomatic weapons, was approved late Monday in the closinghours of the 1989 General Assembly session.   The measure still must be signed by Gov. William DonaldSchaefer, whose support is expected.   Under the legislation, state police would check the backgroundof a prospective gun buyer before a sale could be completed. Thesale would be canceled if police found evidence that the applicantwas a drug addict, alcoholic, convicted felon or was mentallyderanged.   Purchases of 24 specific gun models are affected, and those whoviolate the law would be subject to prison terms of up to threeyears and maximum fines of $10,000.   Earlier in the 90-day session, some legislators proposed banningthe sale of semiautomatics altogether, but later modified themeasure in the face of overwhelming resistance.   In 1988, Maryland passed a bill eliminating cheap handguns knownas Saturday Night Specials. The measure established a nine-memberboard to decide which guns may be manufactured and sold in thestate.   Gun control opponents spent $6 million in a losing effort todefeat that bill. Continued pressure from the National RifleAssociation has kept lawmakers leery of further weapons legislation.   However, lawmakers around the nation have felt pressure tocontrol the spread of semiautomatic weapons, particularly afterJanuary's schoolyard tragedy in Stockton, Calif., where a gunmankilled five children and wounded 30 other people in a rapid burstof gunfire from an AK-47.</TEXT></DOC>
