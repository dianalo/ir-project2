Mr. Strobel is the biotechnologist at Montana State University whose work and career were virtually destroyed last year by federal bureaucrats, lawyers, the nonsense wing of the environmental movement, and timid colleagues. This week, the National Institutes of Health said Mr. Strobel's experiments with a genetically altered bacterium to treat Dutch elm disease had not violated its guidelines on biotechnology.    The NIH's report represents more than just one federal agency's investigation of a controversial incident. Its larger meaning is that the American scientific community is starting to realize that if its work is to continue in the U.S., it will have to fight back against its critics. And that if it fights back, it can prevail.    Prof. Strobel's troubles began when it came to light that he had inserted a bacterium in 14 diseased elm trees without first obtaining the approval of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Prof. Strobel was pursuing a scientific strategy, already well along in the Netherlands, that would make possible the survival of American elm trees, which have been almost wiped out by the famous Dutch fungus. When his action was revealed in the national press, the sky fell on Gary Strobel.    His own colleagues, the Montana State biosafety committee, recommended uprooting and burning his trees and &quot;other punitive actions as deemed necessary.&quot; U.S. science's Rumpelstiltskin, Jeremy Rifkin, screamed about &quot;wanton&quot; violations of federal rules and filed petitions with three federal agencies. The most craven reaction came from the Industrial Biotechnology Association: &quot;We encourage EPA to throw the book at Gary Strobel.&quot;    In August, the EPA formally reprimanded Prof. Strobel. On Sept. 2, the Montana scientist cut down his 14 trees and burned them in a university incinerator.    The scientific community, Prof. Strobel's colleagues, and indeed EPA understood full well that his bacterium posed no danger. However, it has become an established phenomenon of public life that if someone can generate an atmosphere of fearful controversy around some aspect of modern technology -- genetic engineering, nuclear energy, research with animals -- politicians and bureaucrats will tremble. Most often they respond by imprisoning the technology in additional regulations, and supposedly this makes the scary thing go away. We have also discovered that rather than become pawns of lawyers, some American scientists take their work to Japan, West Germany or Switzerland.    Somehow the Strobel affair seems to have altered this pattern. The first sign of significant resistance was an important, widely publicized report by the National Academy of Sciences, which stated flatly that no evidence existed of unique hazards from research techniques commonly associated with genetic engineering. Then in November, EPA announced its intention to ease its recombinant-DNA guidelines and let many experiments be cleared by private biosafety committees. &quot;A pervasive federal presence,&quot; said the EPA's John Moore, &quot;is not needed or desired.&quot;    Now there is this exonerating report on Gary Strobel from NIH, the one federal agency that has developed some sense that it must push back against the publicity-seeking groups that threaten scientific progress in the U.S. No doubt individuals such as Jeremy Rifkin will continue to get their nonsense into the courts and the press. The only real antidote to this assault is a scientific community willing to come forward and publicly denounce the nonsense. </TEXT></DOC>
