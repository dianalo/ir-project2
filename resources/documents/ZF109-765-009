(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Computer Industry Megatrends: 1990 - 2000andM;We are currently undergoing a major paradigm shift guaranteed to change howwe think about our world.andP;  It goes without saying that it is changing us,affecting our work, play--even our politics.andP;  It is also changing the natureof the tools we use--especially computers.andM;We humans tend to pattern our social, political, and technologic structuresaccording to our current view of physical reality.andP;  Back in the Middle Ages,society and science mirrored a divine hierarchy--Dante's series of concentriccrystal spheres the largest of which was heaven.andP;  This world view wasreflected in a social structure in which the divine right of kings wascentral.andM;With Newton, the paradigm changed.andP;  Newtonian physics postulated a distinctlymechanical metaphor--a universe resembling a giant clock.andP;  We mirrored thisview in our political and social structures and we worshiped respectfully, ifsuspiciously, at the alter of technology.andP;  Our job was to keep the skidsgreased and the wheels turning.andP;  When computers arrived on the scene, anelite priesthood emerged to minister to machine needs.andM;But today, the paradigm is shifting again as evidenced by so-called 'New Age'thought.andP;  From quantum physics where observed (measured) particles are muchdifferent from unmeasured ones, to earth science (the Gaia principle), toWerner Erhart's EST, a human potential movement is in full swing.andP;  No longerare we cogs, caught up in the wheels of progress.andP;  We humans are becoming adriving force, the center and focus of innovation.andM;The technological ramifications of this shift are just as amazing as thesocio-political results.andP;  Virtually overnight we saw computers shrink down todesktop size and assume a new and telling moniker--&quot;personal.&quot;andP;  Graphicalinterfaces appeared that communicate (as we do) in metaphor.andP;  Software wascreated that organize tasks (as we do) for working groups.andP;  And with PCs soaffordable, the long-ignored 'End User' began pushing his/her economic weightaround.andP;  The demand: transformation, not just change.andM;A decade ago, Megatrends author John Naisbitt used trending techniques toforecast the shape of the 1980s (the information society, the global economy,the movement off-shore of our manufacturing base).andP;  With the new paradigm inplace change is occurring at rapidfire pace--as though we are onfast-forward.andP;  For this reason, early in 1989 we began an ongoing program toplot computer industry changes using trending techniques.andP;  It is vital thatthose of us with a stake in the computer industry make the right decisions.andO;We believe that this, our first report on computer trends, will help youanticipate new directions and use change rather than be surprised--orvictimized--by it.andM;These six major trends will shape computingandM;in the 1990s:andM;* A shift from text-based to graphics-based systemsandM;* A shift from single-application computing to an empowering,multi-application environmentandM;* A shift from standard, off-the-shelf software to customized applicationssuites and a concomitant rise in customization toolsandM;* A (continuing) shift from centralized (mainframe) processing to distributedprocessingandM;* A shift from proprietary systems to open systems (and the establishment ofWindows, Unix, RISC, and Intel's 80386 series microprocessor as openstandards)andM;* The downsizing of PCs from desktop to notebook/armtop and theconsumerization of hardware and software.andM;Our analysis indicates Microsoft Windows will be the de facto graphicsstandard of the 1990s and play a pivotal role in nearly all of these trends.andO;The inordinate interest generated in mid-1990 indicated Windows is ready toestablish a long-term direction of its own.andM;Windows owes much of its appeal to the personal computer as does Unix, whichbecame a driving market force during 1987 when the PC version called Xenixreached the 250,000 installed user mark.andP;  (The quarter-million point appearsto be a critical mass indicator.) Windows, however, has not experienced thefragmentation of Unix, which suffers from too many incompatible variations.andO;From its introduction in 1984, Windows was the graphical heir to MS-DOS andthe highly successful Intel line of processors.andP;  However, Windows instantfame (and de facto standardhood with the introduction of Windows 3 was notdue to graphics abilities alone.andP;  Windows also made good use of the virtual(multitasking) capabilities of Intel's 386 micro-processor.andM;Windows' other ace is the fact that it comes from an independent softwarehouse, so is not tied to any particular hardware vendor--a problem that hastainted IBM's OS/2.andP;  IBM is, after all, a hardware company.andP;  Why, forexample, would Compaq want to come out with its version of OS/2 six monthsafter IBM?andM;In fact, the recent Microsoft/IBM realignment, with IBM taking over OS/2development, indicates that OS/2 will evolve as a proprietary IBM product.andO;The only appeal will be to corporate networks so 'true blue' that OS/2 andOffice Vision are the only game in town.andP;  The Microsoft/IBM agreement, on theother hand, completely eliminates contractual restrictions on what featuresWindows can contain and allows Microsoft to develop Windows further.andP;  Inparticular, we can expect a full, 32-bit operating system with pre-emptivemultitasking (threads), long file names, and other OS/2-like features.andO;Windows will not, however, have OS/2's 'mainframish' personality because itis first and formost a PC product.andM;Initially, IBM's joint development agreement with Microsoft was probably tohelp IBM position OS/2 as an independent, third-party product.andP;  But the rusehas not worked very well.andP;  For one thing, these two companies are moving inopposing directions.andP;  As a hardware company, IBM (like DEC) has been loosingmoney because it's products are too proprietary.andP;  It has had to bite thebullet and incorporate both Unix and RISC into its product line to keepmarket share.andP;  These days, users vote with their pocketbooks.andM;IBM is like a huge freight train that seems unable to switch tracks.andP;  Evenafter introducing the IBM PC with an open architecture (the AT bus) andseeing how spectacularly successful it was, , the company's next PC linereverted back to a proprietary (Micro Channel) bus.andP;  Apparently IBM'sflirtation with Open Systems was an anomaly.andM;IBM has gone to great lengths to position OS/2 along side its PS/2 series ofcomputers as a 'corporate' (not personal) computing standard.andP;  OS/2, however,with its pre-emptive multitasking, is cut from the same cloth as Unix.andP;  ForOS/2, graphics is a Microsoft add-on, even though graphics is by far the keyingredient in an operating system today.andP;  Since its introduction, OS/2 hasbeen swimming against prevailing industry currents.andP;  In fact, one reason sofew device drivers appeared is because OS/2 doesn't write directly to videomemory.andP;  (These days, we tend to assume everything writes to video memory!)andM;Now we find the graphical future of OS/2 in IBM's hands.andP;  It is doubtful IBMhas the background to develop a PC-based graphical environment alone.andP;  Butthe bottom line is that all Microsoft Windows applications will run underPresentation Manager.andP;  Accordingly, developers have no reason to write aprogram that runs only under Presentation Manager--unless it runs on aserver.andP;  And this is exactly how Microsoft is positioning PresentationManager (i.e., if you need a server, buy OS/2; if you need a workstation, buyWindows).andP;  In the corporate marketplace, we expect to see OS/2 positionedagainst Novell's Netware.andP;  It is no longer realistic to position OS/2 as analternative to MS-DOS and Windows.andM;Graphical GrowthandM;Windows did not become the graphical standard for the 1990s overnight.andO;Fundamental research on systems that could create images on screen, andaddress issues of user-computer interaction began in the early '70s atStanford Research Institute and Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, This ledto experiments like the Xerox Star, a computer that could manipulate graphicsand produce different typefaces and font sizes.andP;  Apple's Lisa followed, andoffered similar capabilities but was priced too high--above $10,000.andP;  Apple'snext attempt, the Macintosh, was also expensive in PC terms.andP;  But coupledwith Adobe's Postscript page description language and Apple's Laserwriterprinter it offered powerful typesetting capabilities and produced a newindustry category--desktop publishing.andM;Picture PerfectandM;The 1980s hosted a basic change in computer design from text-based tographical-based systems.andP;  In fact, graphical computing is so compelling thatwe believe all new microcomputers will be graphics-based.andM;Just ten years ago, low-resolutions and monochrome screens showed littlepromise.andP;  That's because graphics is so complex.andP;  When a text-based machinegenerates a screen character, it sends a character code to a videocontroller.andP;  The controller creates the screen display by looking up a bitimage (or bit-map) for that character in read-only memory (ROM), thenmodulates the CRT's electron beam.andP;  Printers house their own bit maps, andprinted characters are created independent of the CRT display.andM;But with graphical-based computers, instead of simply matching bit maps, thescreen driver calculates each pixel in each character every time it writes tothe screen--whether it produces graphics or text.andP;  To make things even morecomplicated, both software and hardware must cope with new elements--likesizes and styles in a variety of typefaces.andM;IBM PCs (and clones) were snapped up by corporations and hobbyists alikethanks to low price--and key applications like Lotus 1,2,3.andP;  But PCs offeredno standard way to specify graphics.andP;  As a result, every application solvedthe problem differently.andP;  In fact, the Lotus 1-2-3 Graph Format became a defacto standard simply because of the size of the Lotus installed base.andM;Apple solved this problem early with its Macintosh.andP;  To manage graphics andtext consistently, an Apple Fellow named Bill Atkinson devised somethingcalled Quickdraw.andP;  Quickdraw resided in ROM and created screen images, andbecause the Mac used Quickdraw's common instruction set to specify graphicsand text, all Mac applications were able to share them.andM;Soon the PC industry was in dire need of a similar graphics standard.andO;Standardization offered real benefits like file compatibility and deviceindependence.andP;  Device independence frees up application developers fromwriting drivers for each and every display device.andM;And there are other plusses.andP;  A standardized graphical description wouldpermit one PC application to store, then pass along, an image to a second PCapplication.andP;  But the most important advantage was the promise of astandardized interface, so user skills learned from mastering one programwould be transferable to many other programs.andM;The ContendersandM;In the early '80s three companies, Microsoft, Digital Research, and GraphicSoftware Systems, began developing standards build around a graphicsdescription format called Virtual Device Interface (VDI).andP;  At the time,several incompatible VDI variations existed.andP;  Microsoft and Digital Researcheach adapted a version of VDI for their products.andP;  Digital Research's GEM andMicrosoft's Windows were both graphics environments that accomplished insoftware what the Mac handled with firmware (ROM).andP;  As competitors, theyappeared evenly placed with a small following and respectable market niche.andO;The Ventura page layout program for GEM gave Digital Research a slightadvantage.andM;The other contender, Graphics Software Systems GSS/CGI (i.e., GraphicSoftware Systems Computer Graphic Interface) found its way early on intoATandamp;T's Unix PC.andP;  GSS/CGI, however, addressed device independence andcompatibility issues but never attempted to define a particular interface.andO;No single graphics standard seemed likely to dominate in the DOS world untilMay 22, 1990 when Windows 3 was announced.andM;Windows 3, however, ended the contest overnight.andP;  It offered 16 Mbytes ofmemory and multitasking (thanks to the Intel 386's virtual mode) so thatseveral PC applications could run simultaneously.andP;  Moreover, dozens ofWindows 3 applications were available.andM;In addition, Windows 3 immediately solved several significant problems thatcorporations had been experiencing with DOS-based networks, the biggest beingthe 640K memory limitation.andP;  Resident protocols required to connect PCs tominis and mainframes didn't leave enough memory to load and run a large PCprogram like Lotus 1-2-3.andM;At this time corporations were leaving minicomputers in favor of Intel 386sand Local Area Networks (LANs).andP;  LANs are just as powerful as mainframes andcost less.andP;  Windows provides an interface standard that makes LANapplications supportable by corporate MIS departments.andP;  For example, createjust one DDE-compliant module to get to a mainframe and all DDE-compliantapplications can share it.andP;  No need for each application to have a customsolution since a solution that works for Excel also works for Word or SQLWindows.andM;This is especially important to lean corporations with a small support staff.andO;Now MIS departments can make a business case for Windows as a productivitytool.andP;  Windows common user interface and standard keyboard implementationcuts training costs since experience gained with one application appliesdirectly to the next application.andM;Open vs Proprietary SystemsandM;For years now, hardware vendors like, IBM, DEC, Prime, and Unisys, have sungan 'Open Systems' tune in public.andP;  But their private strategy was based onselling hardware that used a proprietary operating system.andP;  The idea was tolock users in and guarantee future sales as these customers upgraded.andM;Companies like Sun Microsystems (Mountain View, CA), that actually sell OpenSystems use a different strategy.andP;  Sun's products are priced competitivelyand Sun maintains a large sales force.andP;  But the company emphasizes serviceand support--something corporations in general lack these days due to adecade of cost cutting.andP;  Sun realized early on that profits come not onlyfrom hardware sales, but from service and support.andM;Proprietary systems now face extinction because hardware has become acommodity.andP;  Experience with Unix showed users that standards (like UncleSam's POSIX and the industry's X/Open) make hardware substitutable, thuslowering the cost of computing.andP;  For Digital Equipment Corp, Prime, Unisys,IBM and even Apple, a flattened market and big customers insisting on OpenSystems compatibility brought the point home.andP;  Digital EquipmentCorporation's VMS and its ilk may still be twitching, but they have nofuture.andM;As a result, proprietary hardware vendors are being forced to incorporateUnix and Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) computers into their product lines.andO;Unix applications cross architectural boundaries easily, while RISC offersenormous raw processing power.andP;  Perhaps the only vendor to come to the Unixtable willingly was Hewlett-Packard, and vendor resistance at DigitalEquipment and elsewhere will undoubtedly cost many jobs over the next fewyears.andP;  Recall Digital CEO Ken Olsen's comment at the announcement of theOpen Software Foundation in 1988 that Unix was &quot;as exciting as a Russiantruck&quot;!andP;  Olsen had missed the point.andP;  Saving money can be very exciting.andM;Apple, by the way, with its proprietary Macintosh line, is in an identicalquandry.andP;  Apple adopted Unix (Apple's A/UX) grudgingly two years ago, and in1991 will introduce a RISC-based machine.andP;  Apple is beginning to understandthat hardware is a commodity item and its strength lies in software--its newline of low-priced Macintoshes reflects that fact.andP;  But the Mac's specialniche--desktop publishing--is about to be swallowed up by Windows and Appleobviously doesn't know where to go.andM;For most proprietary vendors, the next move is simple.andP;  In the office,Hewlett-Packard's NewWave running with Windows is a core 1990 technologysince it is an open system based on industry standards.andP;  NewWave couples anobject-oriented environment with a graphical user interface that integratesdata and files across applications.andM;ATandamp;T was one of the first proprietary hardware vendors to understand theimplications of Open Systems and the need for a standard Unix.andP;  But analliance with Sun evoked a brouhaha that ultimated split Unix in two.andP;  ATandamp;Twas also first to make a NewWave announcement--Rhapsody--last March.andO;Rhapsody uses a client-server architecture to bundle core Windows/NewWave (orUnix) applications including Microsoft Word and Excel, Samna's Ami Pro,Future Soft's Dyna-Comm communications product, and Precision's Superbase IVdatabase product.andP;  ATandamp;T, which invested two years in building their sales andsupport staff, understands that future revenues will come from service andsupport.andM;NCR now offers an entire Intel-based product line (the 3000) and a NewWaveenvironment called 'Cooperation.'andP;  Digital, Canon, Prime, and Wang willfollow with their own NewWave announcements.andP;  In fact, every major player(except IBM, which still is still pushing OfficeVision) will have a NewWaveoffering.andP;  Last April, a vendor group including Hewlett Packard, DataGeneral, Philips International, Prime Computer, Sun Microsystems, Unisys,Gold Hill, Soft-Switch, Canon, American Airlines and 3Com formed the ObjectManagemetn Group Inc. to promote a 'common applications environment' forobject management.andP;  Ostensibly, this coalition indicates that proprietaryvendors have begun to plan a strategic shift to open systems--a good sign.andO;Planning for change is always better than being dragged along, kicking andscreaming.andM;It is worth noting that hardware makers are not alone in resisting change.andO;Lotus Development Corporation and WordPerfect now realize that they cannotignore Windows, but are still waffling on the keyboard question.andP;  (Bothproducts require special function keys, while Windows' strength is itsstandard use of keystrokes across applications.)andP;  As text-based applications,Lotus 1-2-3 and Word Perfect will have to adapt to Windows if they plan tokeep moving in the same direction as the rest of the industry.andP;  Windows isthe standard, and dallying with other graphical environments (as Lotus hasdone) only makes it harder to catch up.andM;The Empowered EnvironmentandM;Windows will be the hub of an enormous aftermarket because the ability to runmany applications on one computer essentially creates a brand new computingenvironment.andP;  Before Windows, users ran applications one at a time.andP;  AS aresult, word processing programs vied directly with each other, resulting in'feature' wars--and monolithic programs that devoured RAM and hard diskspace.andP;  But applications sharing this new environment (including a commoninterface, keyboard, and command structure) will have to work together (i.e.,andO;exchane data)--and not overlap functions.andP;  (How many spell-checkers do weneed on one hard disk?)andM;Instead of simply gobbling up hard disk space, Windows applications will usea wide assortment of utilities--dynamic link libraries.andP;  To create a graph orpie chart, one simply DDE's-in the data.andP;  Applications will become moremodular, especially as the notebook market expands.andP;  In this world one might,for example, load a complete versin of Samna's Ami Pro (all modules) on anoffice PC and place a single module (a 'Pro To Go' without spell-checker andthesaurus) onto a portable machine.andM;Customized WindowsandM;Windows offers corporate in-house developers as well as resellers a macrolanguage for customizing applications.andP;  Windows consultants like Gilbertassociates (Los Angeles) have been highly successful in adapting Windowsshells or MS Word templates and crafting customized, multi-applicationenvironments for market segments like law, real estate, and accounting.andP;  Amarket is already developing around Windows for shells, scripting products,and object oriented tools such as Actor (from Whitewater) and KnowledgePro(from Knowledge Garden).andP;  Object oriented programming is an environment thattreats data and applications like building blocks that can be mixed acrossoperating systems to create complex applications quickly.andM;Notebook ComputersandM;Today, portables like laptops or the new notebook-sized machines are arelatively small part of the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  Theya re mostly DOS-based, overlyexpensive, too weighty, and short on battery power.andP;  Moreover, they are stillconsidered a supplement to a desktop machine.andP;  The introduction by Intel ofthe 386SL three-chip set, however, will accelerate their growth.andP;  This isbecause Intel's chips have a power management system that uses energy moreefficiently and can increase battery life by as much as 50%.andM;We anticipate a series of notebook introduction that will produce portablesthat cost less--and are more desirable than--their desktop-sized counterpartsby 1992.andP;  There is a compelling appeal in the portability of briifcase-sizedcomputers.andM;Even though these machines will use Intel microprocessors, the price ofnotebook computers will noseditive almost overnight, thanks to Japaneseingenuity.andP;  This is because the flat, liquid crystal display screens requiredare chips, and making them in high-volume requires the same processtechnology that gave Japan the lead in memory chips.andM;However, the appeal of portability in a notebook-sized computer is even morecompelling when it runs the latest Windows applications.andP;  NEC and Toshibaalready manufacture notebook-style computers in Japan, and Sony, Fujitsu,Matsushita, and Hitachi have products in the works that will eventuallybundle Windows.andP;  We expect notebook computers to represent a 40% share of theU.S.andP;  PC market by 1995.andM;Notebooks by the way, skipped over Intel's 286 processor and went directly tothe 386--for good reason.andP;  The 286 chip can not run 386-specific software,nor can it run the 32-bit versoin of OS/2.andP;  This means the 286 is not capableof multiple DOS sessions, and offers to easy access to extended memory.andO;Products build around this chip are headed for an early demise given currentcomputer industry directions.andM;Distributed ProcessingandM;The whole industry is heading toward friendly little 386 processors connectedLANs.andP;  File servers, currently the hub of corporate LANs, are becomingobsolete while old-style mainframes have become little more than databaseservers.andP;  With file servers, data is too easily corrupted and is inaccessiblefrom outside the LAN.andM;Soon, new classes of applications servers for database communications andother functions will replace file servers at the hub of corporate LANs.andP;  Andas communications links between natoins improve, social and political forces(like the European Common Market) will spur a need for global computing.andO;Long term, computing will become even more distributed.andM;Other trends are still emerging.andP;  Current shifts in channel-based resellerstrategies and the growth of computer-related supermarkets or &quot;Superstores.andO;indicate changes ahead in how people shop for (and buy) computers.andP;  Windowswill open up the vue-added reseller marekt because distributors do not havethe personnel for extensive consultation or service.andP;  As PC hardware andsoftware prices (and profit margins) continue to drop, the Businesslands ofthe world find themselves unable to increase soft sales (service and support)that requires trained specialists (not sales clerks).andM;Additionally, multimedia as a teaching, entertainment, and sales tool holdsgreat promise.andP;  Ahead lies a decade in which television, compact discs, andthe living room VCR will meld with computer technology, and microprocessorswill be found just about everywhere.andP;  Copy machines,too, will be integratedinto computing, producing easily-retrievable data files instead of paper.andO;(The 'paperless office' revisited.)andM;In fact, the entire computer industry is on a roll that, with minor cyclicaladjustments, will lat until the year 2000.andP;  Windows is the hub of much ofhtis activitity.andP;  We will continue to report emerging trends, and invite youto stay tuned through he pages of Acknowledge The Window Letter.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
