This second noticeidentifies the high-density residential areas that would be affected byconstruction. It has been distributed to the recipients of the first notice,and to homeowners and tenants in selected residential areas whose propertiesmay be crossed by the proposed pipeline or construction equipment.On October 30, 1987, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) applied tothe FERC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, under section7 of the Natural Gas Act, to construct 179.7 miles of interstate gas transmissionpipeline, and 33,625 horsepower of compression at 11 existing and 2 proposedcompressor stations. On February 4, 1988, the FERC staff issued the first<T3>Phase II Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment andRequest for Comments on its Scope,</T3> which was sent to all parties inthe proceeding, government agencies, and interested persons. The firstnotice, which contains information about the entire project, can be obtainedby calling or writing the project manager identified later in this notice.The residential areas that would be affected by the project are in or nearthe Florida cities of Ocala, Orange City, Cocoa, Lakeland, Tampa, Auburndale,and Lake Wales. In total, about 6 miles of pipeline are involved. Mostof the pipeline in these areas would be located entirely within existingpipeline, road, and powerline rights-of-way. Residential properties wouldbe affected by construction activities and temporary construction rights-of-waywould be needed. However, FGT does not propose to acquire any additionalpermanent right-of-way for operation of the pipeline except in two locationswhere there is no existing right-of-way. The proposed location and thetemporary and permanent right-of-way configuration for the residentialareas are identified in Table 1. Schematic drawings of the right-of-wayconfigurations for these areas are shown in Figure 1, and the locationmaps are presented in the appendix to this notice. The route maps and drawingsare not published in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> but are included with copies of the notice distributedby the Commission to all parties in the proceeding, Federal, state andlocal government agencies, and interested members of the public.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Route maps are available from the FERC's Division of Publicand Legal Reference, telephone (202) 357-8118.Presently, FGT's system can transport 825 million cubic feet of gas perday. According to FGT, the proposed facilities are necessary to transportan additional 100 million cubic feet per day for residential, commercial,and industrial customers. The total cost of the project is expected tobe $103,385,000.<ITAG tagnum="84">Current Environmental Issues</ITAG>By this notice, the staff of the FERC is requesting public comments onthe environmental matters that should be addressed in its EA on the proposal.The EA will be used to determine whether the project constitutes a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.It may also contain staff recommendations to the Commission regarding measuresto reduce or avoid impact on the environment. At a minimum, the EA willaddress the following issues; any additional issues will be consideredbased on further staff review or public comments.<ITAG tagnum="15">Land Use_Effect of the right-of-way location and width on existingand future uses of land including residential areas crossed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Restoration_Erosion control, revegetation, soil productivity afterconstruction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Aesthetics_Visual impact of the right-of-way.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Wildlife_Impact on wetlands, threatened or endangered species, andhabitat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Residential Areas Crossed By Pipelines</T4><H1>Project name</H1><H1>State</H1><H1>County</H1><H1>Nearest city or town</H1><H1>Street or area</H1><H1>Distance (feet)</H1><H1>Pipeline diameter (inches)</H1><H1>Right-of-way configuration (see fig.1)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Ocala Lateral (New) a<D>FL</D><D>Marion</D><D>Ocala</D><D>NE. 49th St.</D><P>Parallel powerline existing right-of-way</P><D>3,600</D><P>11,400</P><D>8</D><P>8</P><D>Permit 1.</D><P>O.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Deland Loop b<D>FL</D><D>Volusia</D><D>Orange City</D><D>Parallel FGT pipeline.</D><P>Parallel Route 430A</P><D>1,400</D><P>400</P><D>6</D><P>6</P><D>I.</D><P>Permit 1.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cape Canaveral Loop<D>FL</D><D>Brevard</D><D>Williams Point</D><D>Parallel FGT pipeline.</D><D>2,400</D><D>12</D><D>I.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">OUC/Titusville Loop<D>FL</D><D>......do</D><D>Delespine</D><D>Parallel FGT pipeline.</D><D>1,900</D><D>8</D><D>G.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">St. Petersburg Loop 2<D>FL</D><D>Polk</D><D>Fox Town</D><D>New route in new subdivision, parallel Williams Road</D><D>4,000</D><D>16</D><D>A.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>FL</D><D>......do</D><D>Gibsonia</D><D>Parallel FGT pipeline along Old Polk City and Marcum Roads</D><D>12,000</D><D>16</D><D>Permit 3.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>FL</D><D>......do</D><D>Galloway</D><D>Parallel FGT pipeline through subdivision between Hwy 35A and GallowayRoad</D><D>1,000</D><D>16</D><D>L.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tampa Interconnect (New)<D>FL</D><D>Hillsborough</D><D>Tampa</D><D>Various streets NW of MacDill AFB</D><D>800</D><D>6</D><D>Permit 1.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sarasota Lateral (New)<D>FL</D><D>Polk</D><D>Auburndale</D><D>Various streets in NW Auburndale.</D><P>Across properties in north Jones Corner</P><D>2,400</D><P>2,500</P><D>16</D><P>16</P><D>Permit 1.</D><P>A.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lake Wales Loop<D>FL</D><D>......do</D><D>Floritan/Lake Wales</D><D>Parallel FGT pipeline across residential area adjacent to Hwy 60</D><D>200</D><D>4</D><D>J.</D><F/>a ``New'' means that it would not be parallel and adjacent to anexisting FGT pipeline, although other rights-of-way may be followed.<F/>b ``Loop'' means that the new pipeline would be parallel and adjacentto an existing FGT pipeline.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Geology_Evaluation of potential geologic hazards, including sinkholes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cultural Resources_Potential for impact on historic properties andcultural artifacts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Alternatives_Pipeline route variations and alternative system designs.</ITAG>All interested parties will receive a copy of and be invited to commenton the EA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Construction Procedures</ITAG>FGT proposes to have the facilities in-service by January 1989. Constructingthe pipeline would involve the following procedures:1. The right-of-way would be cleared and graded.2. The trench would be excavated and the spoil would be stockpiled alongone side of the right-of-way.3. Forty-foot sections of pipe would be placed along the trench, the pipewould be bent to fit the trench contour, and the sections welded together.4. The pipeline would be lowered into the ditch.5. The ditch would be backfilled, the pipeline would be tested for leaksusing pressurized water, and the right-of-way would be cleaned up.FGT anticipates that construction along city roads would involve disturbanceto only one or two blocks at a time. The clearing and grading operationswould be followed closely by cleanup and restoration to reduce the timeof traffic disruption in any one area. In residential areas where the pipelinewould not follow roads, FGT proposes to use conventional cross-countryconstruction methods which normally result in disturbance lasting from3 to 6 weeks in any one area. To reduce settling of the trench-fill, theditch would be compacted by rolling with equipment. The disturbed areawould then be seeded or sodded, depending on the requirements of the propertyowner, to match the surrounding vegetation. The work would be performedby the general contractor or a landscaping firm at the contractor's discretion,and the property owner would be asked to water the seed or sod as specifiedin the right-of-way agreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Scoping Procedure</ITAG>The EA will be based on the staff's independent analysis of the proposaland, together with the comments received, will comprise part of the recordto be considered by the Commission in this proceeding. The EA will be sentto all parties in this proceeding, to those providing comments in responseto this notice, the Federal and state agencies, and to interested membersof the public. The EA may be offered as evidentiary material if an evidentiaryhearing is held in this proceeding. In the event that an evidentiary hearingis held, anyone not previously a party to this proceeding and wishing topresent evidence on environmental or other matters must first file withthe Commission a motion to intervene, pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission'sRules of Partice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214).A copy of this notice and request for comments has been distributed toFederal, State, and local environmental agencies, parties in the proceeding,and the public. Written comments on specific environmental issues shouldcontain supporting documentation or rational and be filed as soon as possible,but no later than June 15, 1988. All written comments must reference DocketNo. CP86-704-002 and be addressed to the Secretary. Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. A copyof the written comments should also be sent to the project manager identifiedbelow.Additional information about the proposal, including detailed route mapsfor specific lacations, is available from Mr. Cary Secrest, Project Manager,Environmental Analysis Branch, Office of Pipeline and Producer Regulation,Room 7312, 825 North Capital Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, telephone(202) 357-9048.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
