LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it plans to split its third-largest unit, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., into three separate companies.    A McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman said the company would be split into units focusing on space systems, missile systems and defense electronics products. She said McDonnell Douglas plans to break up the 21-year-old Astronautics company because it had become too large to operate as a single unit. McDonnell Douglas's two largest units are its combat air and transportation units.    The spokeswoman said the breakup wasn't related to the current Pentagon procurement investigation.    The Astronautics unit accounted for about 16%, or $2.13 billion, of McDonnell Douglas's total 1987 revenue of $13.3 billion. The company has been based in St. Louis since 1981.    Under the reorganization, McDonnell Douglas said its Space Systems Co. will move its headquarters to Huntington Beach, Calif. The company will focus on McDonnell Douglas involvement with the space station Freedom as well as space transportation systems and technical services for the Kennedy Space Center and space-related facilities at Huntsville, Ala., Houston and Rockville, Md.    McDonnell Douglas's Missile Systems Co. will be based in St. Louis and consist of the company's tactical missile and combat weapons systems.    The third unit, McDonnell Douglas Electronic Systems Co., will consist of the company's electronics, communications and intelligence systems businesses. No headquarters site has been selected.    John F. Yardley, president of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics, will move to a newly created post of senior corporate vice president and will oversee the restructuring, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
