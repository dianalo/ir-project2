<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-35-0426 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the fifth generation computer systems (FGCS) project of Japan, logicprogramming and parallel processing are adopted as the principle of bothsoftware and hardware system development. Their amalgamation, parallelinference systems are being investigated in ICOT. The target of the hardwaredevelopment effort is a parallel inference machine (PIM) with about 10/sup3/ element processors. A smaller scale PIM with about 10/sup 2/ processorsis planned in the intermediate stage of the project. Another system calledmulti-PSI is planned, which connects up to 64 personal sequential inferencemachines (PSI) relatively loosely for providing parallel software developmentenvironment. Both of these inference machines have the same kernel language(KL1) based on flat GEC as the machine language. As a software project,an operating system for parallel inference machines named PIMOS (parallelinference machine operating system) is under development. Both of theparallel inference machines are planned to have the same operating system.</TEXT></DOC>
