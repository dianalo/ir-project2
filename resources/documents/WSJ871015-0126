Terms weren't disclosed. But the biotechnology concern said it will manufacture the tests and Baxter, Chicago, will sell them through its Pandex division.    Cambridge BioScience said it is conducting human clinical trials with the test and expects it to become available in at least five foreign countries during the first quarter of 1988. The company said it also hopes to receive Food and Drug Administration approval to begin U.S. sales in early 1988.    Cambridge BioScience claimed its Recombigen AIDS test is simpler to use than others because it doesn't require sophisticated equipment or refrigeration. The company added that the test also may be able to detect cases of the disease several days sooner after infection. Researchers believe the disease is detectable with existing tests within a few weeks of infection.    The test, which employs genetically engineered proteins to detect antibodies to AIDS in a patient's blood, is being developed in two versions. One takes five minutes and is designed to be used in doctors' offices, hospital emergency rooms and other applications requiring a fast diagnosis. The second version takes two hours and is aimed at mass screening of large numbers of blood samples, the company said.    The agreement gives another boost to Cambridge BioScience's AIDS research program, which draws upon the work of several prominent AIDS researchers at Harvard University. As previously reported, Cambridge BioScience in July signed an agreement with Institut Merieux, a French vaccine maker, to jointly develop an AIDS vaccine. The company also recently agreed to supply Syntex Corp.'s Syva Co. unit with genetically engineered proteins for use in developing screening tests for AIDS and other diseases. </TEXT></DOC>
