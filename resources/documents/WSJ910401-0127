On Friday, the FDIC received bids to buy the entire Bankof New England from San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp.,Bank of Boston Corp., and a joint bid from the leveragedbuy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and theProvidence, R.I.-based Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. Asmall investor group from Maine also has placed a bid, butonly to buy the bank's Maine subsidiary.</LP><TEXT>   Whichever bid the FDIC chooses by April 16 -- itsannounced deadline for selecting a winner -- the decision issure to prompt immediate shifts in the stocks of the bidders,intense congressional scrutiny and years of publicsecond-guessing.   The seizing of the $20 billion-asset bank, once thesecond-largest bank in New England, will cost the FDIC atleast $2.3 billion, making it the third costliest failure ofa banking company. But, with many FDIC officials nowestimating the agency will have to assume between $6 billionand $8 billion in bad assets -- more than was originallyanticipated -- the price tag for the government is almostcertain to rise.   The FDIC's only chance to defray those costs and notfurther burden its already beleaguered bank fund, is to getthe highest price it can for the bank.   The FDIC is releasing only the names of the bidders --nothing about their offers. The bidders vary widely as to howthe offers are configured and the strengths each hopes willassure victory.   For BankAmerica, the nation's second-largest bank with$110.7 billion in assets and 1990 net income of just over$1.1 billion, &quot;the Bank of New England is for it to lose,&quot;according to a top Bank of New England official.   In the past two years, the bank has bought nine failedthrifts in the Southwest, sometimes at premium prices, andstill has $6.4 billion in capital. &quot;But buying those thriftsfit with their `dominate the West' strategy. This isdifferent; it's both a stretch across the country and theunfamiliar, big leagues of bank buying,&quot; said a former topBankAmerica executive. &quot;It's not clear that they really wantBank of New England bad enough to outbid the competition.&quot;   There has been vigorous debate within the bank about thepropriety of making a large investment in the dicey NewEngland economy, according to people close to BankAmerica.But BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive officer,Richard Rosenberg, grew up in the Boston area, as did itschief financial officer, Frank Newman, and both want to makea strong bid.   In terms of available capital, BankAmerica can easily bematched by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which has more than $2billion in ready capital and easy access to more, and isbidding jointly with Fleet/Norstar Financial Group. While theFDIC says it wants private capital and fresh managementtalent brought into banking, it has been criticized for beingprejudiced against non-bank bidders in other sales of failedbanks.   That shouldn't be a problem this time, as KKR combines itscapital with the banking expertise of Fleet, still consideredthe region's best-managed large bank, despite a loss of $48.5million last year, mostly from soured real-estate loans.   &quot;You've got Bank of Boston telling the FDIC that Bank ofAmerica could overwhelm weak New England banks and cause morefailures and FDIC costs while Bank of America responds thatthey would bring much needed capital to New England,&quot; saidFirst Albany Corp.'s chief analyst Don Kauth. &quot;KKR/Fleet insome ways solves that debate: Fleet plays to regionalinterests while KKR genuinely brings new capital intobanking, rather than BankAmerica just spreading its Westcoast bank capital in the East.&quot;   At this point, Bank of Boston can also boast of bringingfresh capital into the industry, considering the crowd thathas committed to investing about $500 million in Bank ofBoston -- in return for preferred stock and equity -- so thatthe bank can make a bid. According to people involved in thedeal, the investors are several companies with executives onthe bank's board, including three insurance companies andGeneral Cinema Corp., investor Warren Buffett andBoston-based buy-out specialist Thomas H. Lee.   Bank of Boston can realize the greatest cost savings ofany of the potential buyers because of overlapping operationsbetween the two banks. Bank of Boston Chairman Ira Stepaniansaid last week that projected cuts could be between 35% and60% of Bank of New England's current non-interest expense, orbetween $250 million and $450 million annually. That wouldmean enormous profitability for the $12 billion to $14billion of good assets that are left in Bank of New England,once the FDIC takes the bank's bad assets. Such cost savingswould allow the Bank of Boston to make a higher bid and stillget the same rate of return on its investment.   Another question is whether the FDIC will place itsconfidence in Bank of Boston management, considering thebank's loss of $395 million last year and its large portfolioof nonperforming assets.   &quot;It's strange that the FDIC could help solve theoverbanking in the region by going with Bank of Boston and,in a way, reward the bank for being in the worst shape of thebidders -- and needing this deal the most,&quot; adds GerardCassidy, an analyst at Tucker, Anthony Inc.   The final bidder, New Maine Bank Associates, an investorgroup led by Mr. Marco DeSalle, a Portland businessman,restauranteur and former banker, is bidding for the $1billion Maine subsidiary of Bank of New England. But it isconsidered unlikely the FDIC will split up the bank.   Even though the highest bid is the key criteria for theFDIC, the agency said it won't play one bidder againstanother to drive up the price. But a senior FDIC officialadded that the FDIC may seek clarification of bids or askbidders to consider additional facts, the kind of dialoguethat often leads to changes in an offer.   ---   Kenneth H.
