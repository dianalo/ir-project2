The television said it landed near a line of people waiting for abus near the Mikrorayon district, where senior government officialslive. The victims included people waiting at a distribution centerfor scarce flour and cooking oil, witnesses said.   Guerrillas surround Kabul and attack supply convoys, creatingsevere food and fuel shortages, but have fired few rockets into thecity as the Feb. 15 deadline nears for withdrawal of all Sovietmilitary forces. This was the first reported in several days.   Soviet military transports fly in hundreds of tons of flour dailyto help feed the poor in a city packed with 2 million residents andrefugees, but a Soviet officer said the flights would end with thewithdrawal.   A U.N. airlift of food and medicine from Pakistan to Kabul hadbeen expected to start Tuesday, but has been delayed at least untilThursday.   Col. Pavel Vinokunovsaid 35 Soviet air force planes, most of themgiant Ilyushin 76 transports, have brought 600 tons of flour to thecapital every day. Vinokunov, who has spent 2{ years in Afghanistan,commands the Red Army soldiers who guard the airport and protect theaircraft.   He said the airlift would contine until Monday, two days beforethe deadline, when he and his men will leave the defense of theairport to Afghan forces and return to the Soviet Union.   Vinokunov would not reveal how many men he commanded, but said:``We have enogh to fulfill the task, to do the job and then some.''   Soviet diplomats said privately fewer than 500 Soviet soldiersremined in Kabul.   In Moscow, the official news agency Tass quoted Col. Gen. MikhailMoiseyev, military chief of staff, as Wednesday the last Sovietsoldier would leave Afghanistan on Feb. 14.   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said Gen. B. V. Gromov, theRed Army commander in Afghanistan, would be the last to leave, atprecisely 10 a.m. Feb. 15, the deadline.   It said he would march across the border bridge at Termez andmake a silent speech to himself for precisely 1 minute and 7seconds. It did not say whether those were Gromov's plans or its ownspeculation.   The Kremlin sent military forces to Afghanistan in December 1979to help combat Moslem guerrillas who began fighting after aCommunist coup in April 1978. An estimated 115,000 Red Army soldierswere in the country when the pullout began May 15 under aU.N.-mediated agreement.   In Islamabad, Pakistan, U.N. officials said the crew of achartered EgyptAir transport had refused to make the first flight ofthe U.N. airlift to Kabul with 32 tons of supplies and EthiopianAirlines had agreed to do it.   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who directs the $1.1 billion U.N.relief and reconstruction program for Afghanistan, said the UnitedNations ``does not share the apprehension'' of the airline about thesafety of Kabul's airport ``and is convinced of the urgent needs tobe met on the bases of a humanitarian consensus among all thoseconcerned.''   In Cairo, the official Middle East News Agency quoted HassanAfifi, operations director of EgyptAir, as saying flights to Kabul``have been postponed, not canceled, until security conditions therestabilize.'' There was no elaboration.   Rene Albeck, spokesman for the relief program, said the charteredEthiopian plane would fly from Quetta, in arid Baluchistan provinceabout 65 miles from the Afghan border in southwestern Pakistan. Hesaid large U.N. storage depots were located there and at Peshawar innorthwestern Pakistan and the two cities would be the hubs for aiddelivery.   An estimated 350,000 people living in Kabul shantytowns are shortof food and heating fuel in one of the harshest winters of recentyears.   Long lines form daily for bread. The city needs 650 tons of floura day and officials estimate the reserve is enough for only one tothree months.   The Soviet Union airlifted 3,100 tons of flour to the city lastmonth and has said another 12,000 tons would be brought in by Feb.15.   Vinokunov said the halfway point was reached Wednesday.   As he spoke with foreign journalists, huge Ilyushin jets took offand climbed steeply over the mountains that surround Kabul, spittingout dozens of flares to deflect the heat-seeking missiles oftenfired by guerrillas.   Helicopter gunships, also spouting flares, circled in a two-mileradius from the runway in search of guerrilla hideouts in themountains.   Until this week the transports carried equipment, soldiers andSoviet civilians home, the colonel said, but now they return to theSoviet Union empty.</TEXT></DOC>
