Billed as the biggest participation event in history, thesix-mile road runs will begin in searing heat or torch-litdarkness, at speed or at a casual pace, when starting pistols firesimultaneously in 128 countries at 11 a.m. EDT.   From remote island outposts to the crowded streets of London,New York, Moscow and Hong Kong, young and old will don ``I Changedthe World'' T-shirts for an enlarged rerun of Sport Aid '86.   Organizer Nick Cater called it ``a petition of blistered feet''to help poor countries ``do something for their children.''   ``Our slogan is `Change the World','' he said. ``We hope toinspire people to feel that they can make a very real difference tothe world they live in.''   The race starts at dawn local time on Monday in the Pacificisland of Tonga, ``the land where time begins,'' and as the Sundayevening sun sets over the Pyramids in Egypt, Cater said.   All 58 residents in the South Pacific island of Pitcairn Islandhave pledged to run, as have the majority of the 2,000 residents inNorfolk Island off Australia.   ``When you live on a small island you tend to become veryisolated from the rest of the world,'' said Tom Lloyd, editor ofthe Norfolk Islander newspaper.   ``Now we feel part of it. It's the biggest thing that's happenedon the island.''   Two children from each participating country will formally kickoff the global event with a 1,000-yard run from New York's FifthAvenue to the steps of the United Nations headquarters.   They will be accompanied by Omar Khalifa, a Sudanese athlete wholaunched the May 25, 1986, race that raised more than $35 millionfor African famine victims.   Official runs have been organized in only 15 major Americancities, and Cater said ``the bigger nations of the world can be alittle insular.''   ``We just wish we could reach out to all the people in the(United) States,'' he said.   The 1986 race, which attracted nearly 20 million runners in 89countries, flopped in the United States because it coincided with anationwide ``Hands Across America'' campaign to raise funds for thepoor.   Sport Aid will be broadcast live in six languages to a potentialaudience of 1.5 billion people through satellite TV and radiolink-ups to 23 cities. Coverage will include excerpts of carnivalsand concerts from Trinidad to Dubai to Rio de Janeiro.   Pope John Paul II will relay a special message of support duringhis visit to Zimbabwe.   Money raised from runners' sponsors, ticket sales to the racesand from sideline events will go to charities in mainlyunderdeveloped nations. One-fifth of funds raised in each developedcountry will go to poor and disabled children in that country.   The United Nations Children's Fund estimates that nearly 15million children die each year from hunger and easily preventablediseases.   By Saturday, 26 million people had signed up to run, but Londonofficials of Sport Aid said they expect as many as 50 million whenthe starting pistols are fired.   Sport Aid said Zambia's President Kenneth Kuanda will start therace in the capital city of Lusaka. Iceland's President VigdisFinbogadott, Mauritius' First Lady, Lady Sugnautah, and Braziliansoccer star Pele will put on their running shoes and participate intheir country's runs.   Other locally organized fund-raising events include across-country ski event by British army marines in the SouthAtlantic island of South Georgia, and runs by passengers aboard theluxury ocean liner Canberra in the Mediterranean and by oil workersaboard tankers in the Gulf of Oman.   In China, where 2.3 million runners have signed up, doctors willhold special roadside clinics and donate their fees to helpinoculation and other medical programs.   Sudan has organized a run alongside the flood-swollen Nile Riverin Khartoum, but Bangladesh, also devastated by floods, haspostponed its race, Cater said.   In Malaysia, government ministers will join a relay race inKuala Lumpur. Free-fall army parachutists will herald the start ofthe race in Oman by descending into Muscat's Sultan Qaboos Stadium.   In the United Arab Emirates, a massive 11-tier Sport Aid cakeweighing 440 pounds was officially cut in Dubai and an officialSport Aid torch was moved by helicopter from Abu Dhabi to Dubai.About 2,000 people were expected to run Sunday.   Cater urged ``everybody on Sunday to do anything they can tohelp, whether it's just going out and giving money to a localchildren's charity. Let's do something for the kids of the world.''</TEXT></DOC>
