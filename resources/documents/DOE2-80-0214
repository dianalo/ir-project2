After the policy of operation systems for power systemsis shown, practical operation systems are presented. As for the automatedservices of central dispatching offices, local dispatching stations andsystem dispatching stations, the outline of an operation planning, supplyand demand control, system monitoring, and data recording are presented.The following techniques for the automated systems are described: thereliability monitoring to prevent power supply failures caused by systemstability reduction, the optimal power flow calculation including theeconomical load dispatching calculation to minimize power generationcosts and the power flow calculation function to plan system operations,the introduction of an expert system to system operation, the techniquesto automate normal system operations and accident release operations,the large capacity high speed communication system to monitor or controlpower systems, the man-machine interface for monitoring or control, andthe future advanced power communication system.
