(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   USAir and American Airlines on Fridayannounced a 4.2 percent fare increase for domestic flightseffective Oct. 1, blaming the increase in higher fuel prices fromthe Persian Gulf crisis.   With the announcements, the airlines join a growing group ofcarriers to impose a second increase in fares since Iraq invadedKuwait. Delta Air Lines on Thursday announced a 4.2 percentincrease, while Pan American World Airways and Alaska Air have alsoannounced fare hikes, most to take effect Oct. 1.   The increase comes on top of a 5.3 percent increase that nearlyall domestic airlines imposed Aug. 30, due to higher jet fuelcosts.   USAir said the cost of jet fuel has periodically risen more than30 cents per gallon above the average price of 58.5 cents pergallon in the second quarter of this year.   Each 1 cent increase in fuel costs translates to $13 million inannual costs for the carrier, the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
