The aims of the investigationswere to elucidate the chemical mechanism of the reaction and to obtaininformation about the location of the rate-limiting steps. The V andV/K/sub NADPH/ profiles indicate that a single ionizing group at theactive center of the enzyme must be protonated for catalysis, whereasthe K/sub i/ profiles show that the binding of NADPH to the free enzymeand of ATP-ribose to the enzyme-dihydrofolate complex is pH independent.From the results of deuterium isotope effects on V/K/sub NADPH/, it isconcluded that NADPH behaves as a sticky substrate. It is this stickinessthat raises artificially the intrinsic pK value of 6.4 for the Asp-27residue of the enzyme-dihydrofolate complex to an observed value of 8.9.Thus, the binary enzyme complex is largely protonated at neutral pH.The elevation of the intrinsic pK value of 6.4 for the ternary enzyme-NADPH-dihydrofolatecomplex to 8.5 is not due to the kinetic effects of substrates. Rather,it is the consequence of the lower, pH-independent rate of product releaseand the faster pH-dependent catalytic step. The data for deuterium isotopeand deuterium solvent isotope effects are consistent with the postulatethat, for the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, protonationprecedes hydride transfer. A scheme is proposed for the indirect transferof a proton from the enzyme to dihydrofolate.</TEXT></DOC>
