This is a highly optimisticmessage, since it implies that cancer is largely a preventable disease.To meet this challenge we must, however, understand the mechanisms ofcancer causation at the cellular and molecular levels and, in a paralleleffort, develop new laboratory methods that can be used to identify specificcausative agents in humans. The approach must be comprehensive sinceit is likely that human cancers are due to complex interactions betweenmultiple factors, including the combined actions of chemical and viralagents. This paper reviews recent studies from our laboratory and studiesby other investigators related to these themes. A major principle instudies on mechanisms of carcinogenesis is that the process proceedsthrough multiple discernible stages, including initiation, promotion,and progression. It is likely that the transition between these stagesis driven by different environmental and endogenous factors and involvesdifferent biochemical mechanisms and genetic elements. Several typesof chemicals initiate the carcinogenic process by yielding highly reactivespecies that bind covalently to cellular DNA. Our group has elucidatedthe details of this process with two groups of compounds, aromatic aminesand polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, emphasizing how these agents distortthe conformation of DNA and its functions during DNA replication andtranscription. The implications of these findings with respect to oncogeneactivation, DNA amplification, gene transposition, and chromosome translocationsare discussed. 74 references.</TEXT></DOC>
