 It's likegiving a package to the mailroom and specifying that it be sent by overnightcourier, UPS, or parcel post, without knowing how to fill out the specificforms required by the different services.andM;Learning a communications protocol can take many months, and protocol-relatedcode may constitute 25 percent or more of a client-server programmingproject.andP;  So RPC tools speed things up even for developers who are going touse only a single protocol.andP;  When the developer needs to implement the sameapplication for multiple protocols, an RPC programming tool can become nearlyindispensable.andP;  Using RPCs for initial development provides a strong measureof insurance: If the application ever has to be implemented using a newprotocol, a daunting task becomes trivial.andM;Some RPC programming tools can handle differences in data representation.andO;For instance, different microprocessors, such as those from Motorola andIntel, may represent data differently.andP;  The RPC programming tool canautomatically translate between these data formats.andM;A number of large vendors provide RPC programming tools that are designed forthe vendor's specific network environment.andP;  However, one little company inBoulder, Colo., has made a name for itself as an independent enterprisededicated solely to providing RPC programming tools for a broad range ofprotocols--eight at last count.andP;  Netwise's RPC Tool has been adopted byNovell as NetWare RPC.andP;  Sun Microsystems sells it in addition to its own RPCprogramming tool.andP;  RPC Tool is sold by Data General, Concurrent Computer, andWang Laboratories as part of their systems.andP;  These three vendors, as well asUnisys and NCR, are using RPC Tool to build mission-critical applications.andM;The &quot;attack of the RPCs&quot; has generated a profusion of war stories: tales ofinhouse developers keeping up with kaleidoscoping network environments andyarns of commercial developers, systems integrators, and resellers smugglingapplications to a succession of new machines or network protocols.andP;  Seldom,however, does the average user get a glimpse behind the scenes to witness anRPC programming tool helping to build a fax server, a document retrievalsystem, and a nationwide network management system.andP;  Such are the storiesthat follow.andM;Fax AttackandM;To a large extent, the onslaught of the RPCs is taking place in hundreds oflittle software shops around the world.andP;  One example is Share Communications(Seattle, Wash.), the maker of FaxShare, fax server software for NetWare andNetBIOS-compatible LANs.andP;  The FaxShare application consists of two parts: theserver (usually, one per network) and clients (up to hundreds per network).andO;The FaxShare server provides shared fax services; it sends and receives faxesthrough an Intel Connection Coprocessor or Brooktrout fax board.andP;  The serversoftware runs under NetWare 386 as a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) or on aDOS workstation attached to a NetWare 286 or 386 LAN.andP;  It also runs on anyother network that supports DOS workstations.andP;  Client software for accessingthe FaxShare server can run under DOS or Microsoft Windows.andM;Share supports two configurations for FaxShare: a network-independentconfiguration that relies on shared files at the server and aNetWare-specific configuration that requires IPX.andP;  Because it depends only onDOS file I/O, the first configuration is compatible with all networks thatsupport DOS workstations.andM;For the NetWare environment, FaxShare relies on direct communication betweenFaxShare clients and the FaxShare server via IPX, without the intervention ofthe NetWare file server.andP;  Leaving the file server &quot;out of the loop&quot; has someadvantages.andP;  Performance is one; file I/O is generally slow compared todirect communication over a LAN.andP;  In addition, keeping all fax users loggedinto the file server all the time places a burden on the file server andnetwork operating system.andP;  It restricts the number of people who can use thefax server simultaneously.andP;  This limitation is particularly onerous inmultiple file server environments, where users on all file servers want touse the fax server.andM;Share found that using the Netwise RPC Tool made programming with IPX no moredifficult than programming file I/O.andP;  RPC Tool also eliminates thedifficulties of programming for different protocols in the future.andP;  Theexisting program can simply be recompiled for protocols such as NetBIOS,LU6.2, Named Pipes, TCP/IP, DECnet, and others as Netwise adds support forthem.andP;  The clincher was that NetWare RPC, which Share already had as part ofthe NetWare Developers Kit, is a version of the Netwise RPC Tool, with justthe IPX library included.andM;Share's ambition doesn't stop with IPX and NetWare.andP;  The company wants Unixworkstations and other machines to be able to access the FaxShare server,too.andP;  &quot;Today's market is increasingly one of mixed platforms,&quot; says KenHilliard, president of Share Communications.andP;  &quot;We want to reach everywhere wecan.&quot;andM;NetWare LANs are Share's primary market today, notes Hilliard, and Sharecan't afford to devote disproportionate resources to Unix, which will bringless income in the immediate future.andP;  The C programming language takes careof some of the problems of porting from one environment to another.andP;  Forexample, file operations in C are much the same under Unix, DOS, and NetWare.andO;When it comes to communications, however, it's a different story.andP;  &quot;We caneasily write a Unix program to open and close files,&quot; says Hilliard.andP;  &quot;RPCTool makes client-server programming for multiple environments equallysimple.&quot;andM;Given the modest payback, creating a Unix client for FaxShare would probablybe prohibitively expensive for a small company like Share, according toHilliard, if it weren't for the Netwise RPC Tool.andP;  RPC Tool allows Share toreuse the DOS client code for the Unix client.andP;  Although Share may have tomake many changes to the code to port it from DOS to Unix, the communicationsportion of the program will require no change.andP;  RPC Tool also handlesmachine-specific differences--if the Unix workstation is based on a MotorolaCPU, for instance, as opposed to an Intel CPU.andM;LAN of the Light BrigadeandM;While many RPC Tool users are small software vendors looking for a way tosurvive in a multiprotocol, multiplatform world, great enterprises may adoptNetwise's software.andP;  For example, with about two million employees, theOffice of the U.S.andP;  Secretary of Defense may be the largest endeavor in humanhistory.andP;  While our troops work with more traditional weapons, manygovernment workers wield an RPC-based application to respond quickly andefficiently to information requests.andM;The Office of the Secretary of Defense gets a request for a report on all theoil resources at U.S.andP;  military bases worldwide.andP;  In the past, a team ofworkers produced such a report by wading through a mountain of papers andabstracting the necessary information.andP;  Soon, they will be able to compilethe same report without looking at a single piece of paper.andP;  Instead, theywill use an optical disk-based document storage and retrieval system calledOptimis, from Systems Research and Applications (SRA) in Arlington, Va.andM;The hardware for the system consists of a combined scanner and OpticalCharacter Recognition (OCR) software, an optical jukebox, an index server, animage server, and end user workstations.andP;  All devices are connected via afiber-optic Ethernet.andP;  Networking among the index server, the image server,and the end user workstations is provided by TCP/IP.andP;  Both servers areimplemented on Sun Microsystems' 3/280 workstations running Sun/OS, a versionof Unix.andP;  End user workstations are Sun's 386i, also running Sun/OS.andM;Hard-copy documents are scanned and stored on the image server.andP;  Text can berecognized by the OCR and stored in an ASCII format.andP;  Other information isstored as images.andP;  Once the documents are in the system, a user makesrequests at a workstation with a graphical user interface.andP;  For example, auser may bring up a list of all documents after a certain date that containthe word &quot;oil.&quot;andP;  The index server, which runs an Oracle database, providesthis list.andP;  The user may then view the selected documents, looking at images,word processing files, electronic mail, facsimiles, and computer data, all ona single screen.andP;  Finally, the user may request that some documents aredownloaded to a local hard disk from the image server.andP;  The user may alsocombine several documents or parts of documents into a single file, or he maysend documents or parts of documents to other users or groups.andP;  In short,Optimis can eliminate nearly all paper handling.andM;One impressive feature of the system is its capacity.andP;  The Cygnet Series 1800Jukebox can support up to five Optimem 2400 write-once-read-many drives andup to 131, 12-inch optical disk cartridges, each of which can hold 2.2GB ofdata.andM;&quot;You might think that nobody could really make use of that kind of capacity,&quot;says Michael Lorton, the project leader for implementing Optimis for theOffice of the Secretary of Defense.andP;  &quot;But a single page of graphics takesabout 100KB of disk space even in compressed form, and I encountered onesingle office with 170 filing cabinets full of material that had to be putinto the system.andP;  Frankly, I don't see how they ever got along without asystem like this.&quot;andM;In implementing Optimis, SRA had the advantage of a single-vendor,single-protocol environment.andP;  Both the servers and workstations come fromSun, run Sun/OS, and use TCP/IP for network communications.andP;  Thus, an RPCprogramming tool was not needed to ease the task of writing to multipleprotocols.andP;  Nor was portability across different network operating systems anobstacle.andM;The problem RPC Tool solved has to do with getting workstations to talk tothe Oracle server.andP;  Oracle provides a means of doing this: SQL*Net.andP;  However,it would have cost about $2,000 per workstation to use Oracle's SQL*Net withOptimis, says Lorton.andP;  Given those high costs, SRA began considering thepossibility of creating its own substitute for SQL*Net.andP;  If SRA used RPCTool, it would not be a difficult project.andM;&quot;With the RPC Tool,&quot; says Lorton, &quot;We wrote our own [equivalent of] SQL*Netin about a week, saving us thousands of dollars.&quot;andP;  Using RPC Tool eliminatedany direct programming to the TCP/IP protocol.andP;  It also took care ofmachine-specific differences between the servers and workstations.andP;  The 3/260is based on the Motorola MC68020, while the 386i is based on the Intel 80386.andO;The two chips require different data representation formats.andP;  Beforediscovering RPC Tool, SRA dealt with these differences by transferring onlyASCII characters between the two machines, which was extremely limiting andinconvenient.andP;  RPC Tool transparently converts alphanumeric characters,integers, floating point numbers, and other data types from one format to theother.andM;&quot;Transparently&quot; is not just a convenient description in this instance, saysLorton.andP;  &quot;I really don't know how it does it.andP;  And it's not important.andP;  Itjust does it.&quot;andM;Victory in CanadaandM;Automating the Office of the Secretary of Defense seems impressive, but RPCshave made a colossal conquest to the north.andM;When it comes to bringing images and sound into Canadian homes andbusinesses, Rogers Communications (Toronto, Ont.) does it all: telephone,radio, broadcast television, and cable television.andP;  It takes a large anddiverse wide area network to support all these different kinds ofcommunication.andP;  Rogers' network includes fiber-optic, microwave, satellite,and coaxial links to more than two million &quot;points of presence&quot; in Canada.andO;Each point of presence contains many types of equipment, such as modems,multiplexers, telephone switching equipment, and cable TV amplifiers.andM;Each device is monitored constantly for a possible malfunction.andP;  Althoughsome devices are intelligent enough to generate messages only when a problemarises, most generate a continuous stream of status messages.andP;  A networkmanagement system must interpret these messages to determine whether theequipment is working properly.andM;Historically, Rogers used different management systems for different types ofequipment, each typically supplied by the hardware vendors.andP;  Additionally,Rogers used multiple regional network management centers, since the companycould not find one system that could keep up with all the status messages.andO;The drawback to this fragmented approach was the difficulty of correlatingalarms.andM;A malfunction in one device or part of the network can cause problems forother devices in other locations.andP;  To determine which alarm reflects theoriginal cause, the alarms must be examined to see how they relate to oneanother; that is, they have to be correlated.andP;  If the various networkequipment types are managed by entirely separate systems, there is no waythat correlation can be automated.andP;  Instead, human operators have to look atstatus messages on a number of different screens, using a variety of networkmanagement systems, perhaps in many geographical locations, then correlatetheir findings.andP;  This requires a large, highly skilled team.andM;Rogers realized that as its network continued to grow, the manual approach tointegrating network management would become costly and perhaps evenimpractical.andP;  Rogers began looking for a commercial system that could handleany number of devices, users, locations, and protocols; it found that noexisting system filled its needs.andP;  Furthermore, the available systems werevery expensive.andP;  A fault-tolerant system that could survive the failure of anetwork management center would cost several million dollars or more.andP;  Muchof that cost was for minicomputers or mainframes needed to run the networkmanagement software.andM;Rogers began to consider building a network management system to meet itsneeds, using off-the-shelf microcomputer and LAN technology as its primarybase.andP;  If such a system were possible, the company was sure it would be farless expensive than mainframe- or mini-based alternatives.andP;  Initial costs andongoing maintenance costs would be lower by orders of magnitude, according toRogers' estimates.andM;Rogers designed a three-layered network management architecture.andP;  At thehighest level are standard graphical user interfaces: Microsoft Windows forDOS computers and Motif for Unix boxes.andM;At the second layer, the network management protocols are based on OSI'sCommon Management Information Protocol (CMIP).andP;  The fledgling networkmanagement protocol defines basic network management messages exchanged overthe network.andP;  Since nearly all network equipment manufacturers willultimately support CMIP, Rogers gains very wide compatibility by conformingto CMIP.andM;The lowest level moves packets around the management system.andP;  This layer islargely based on NetWare and NetWare bridges using T-1, X.25, andasynchronous services.andP;  It also includes 386 PCs running Santa Cruz OperationXenix and ATandamp;T 3B2 workstations running ATandamp;T Unix.andP;  Unix machines communicateusing TCP/IP.andP;  Rogers plans to add Sun SPARCstations, a reduced instructionset chip (RISC) computer that runs Sun/OS.andM;Rogers employed the RPC Tool at this lowest level.andP;  Rogers had to implementits software on three platforms: PCs, SPARCstations, and 3B2s.andP;  Rogers wantedthe flexibility to move to OSI transport protocols in the future, eitherwithin NetWare and Unix or in a move to other operating environments.andM;Under DOS and NetWare, Novell's IPX is the preferred transport because of itsspeed and efficiency.andP;  The Unix boxes, however, do not support IPX, so Rogersused TCP/IP and IP routers.andM;RPC Tool made it much easier to develop for NetWare and Unix simultaneously,while keeping future options open.andP;  Rogers did not have to write any IPX- orTCP/IP-specific code.andP;  Instead, it wrote to the Netwise interface, and RPCTool automatically created all the communications-specific code for bothenvironments, while handling machine-specific differences between the PC andthe 3B2.andP;  The Sun version of the Netwise RPC Tool took care of communicationsin the Sun environment.andP;  Of course, programmers must account for thedifferences between DOS and Unix.andM;As a bonus, using the RPC Tool makes it much easier for Rogers to license itssource code to other communications companies or equipment vendors.andO;&quot;Potential licensees want something they can implement quickly, no matterwhat their networking environments,&quot; says Ken Nickerson, manager ofinformation technology for Rogers Cable Systems, a division of RogersEngineering.andM;&quot;Licensing software to equipment vendors brings the added benefit of creatinga symbiotic relationship between those vendors and Rogers,&quot; Nickerson adds.andO;Equipment vendors use the software with other clients, enhance it, expand it,and fix problems that Rogers has not yet encountered.andP;  As part of theexchange, Rogers can then use the improved software.andM;From a network management system to a document retrieval system in the Officeof the Secretary of Defense to a fax gateway--the invasion of the RPCs is notover.andP;  They may be coming to your LAN next.andM;Michael Hurwicz is a consultant and freelance writer specializing innetworks.andP;  He is based in Eastsound, Wash.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
