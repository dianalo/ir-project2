The other is a floor heat storage thatgives heat from the surface to the room. A solid material is used asthe heat storage medium, and a fluid is used as the heat-carrier. Theheat exchange between the heat-storage medium and the heat-carrier fluidis enhanced by using plate fins on the heat-carrier tubes. The heat conductivityof the heat storage medium is usually low, and the fins may have a greateffect on the rate of the heat transfer. The finned-tube solids heatstorage suits well for high-temperature applications, in which usuallyexpensive pressurized vessels are used as heat storages.</TEXT></DOC>
