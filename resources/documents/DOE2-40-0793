CO adsorptionon this surface is predominantly molecular. We show that changes in thecerium 3d spectrum upon CO chemisorption may be separated into initial-and final-state effects. In the initial state, stabilization of the (Ce)(5d6s)34f1configuration occurs due to an increase in effective nuclear charge onthe cerium atom. This leads to a decrease in f0 intensity in the recordedspectrum. Increased f-electron repulsion in the final state raises theenergy of the f2 final-state configuration and causes a 2.2-eV shiftto higher binding energy of the 3d5/2f2 peak. The 0.5-eV binding energyshifts of the 3d5/2f1 and 3d3/2f1 peaks along with the 2.2-eV shift ofthe 3d5/2f2 peak indicate that the f orbitals are quite-sensitive indicatorsof the surface oxidation state in this compound.</TEXT></DOC>
