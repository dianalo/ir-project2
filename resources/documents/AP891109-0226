In the first government comment on the changes convulsing theSoviet Union's ally, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.Gerasimov praised East Germany for its leadership shake-up and itsfirst steps toward Soviet-style reforms.   He told a news briefing that although it was not the SovietUnion's place to comment on another country's internal affairs, itwas clear East Germany was undertaking a ``renewal of socialism.''   Gerasimov called East Germany an ``important, one might say,strategic ally'' of the Soviet Union and said Moscow is closelyfollowing events there.   In its account of the briefing, the official news agency Tassreported:   ``Commenting on deliberations in the Western press about thepossible reunification of Germany, ... (Gerasimov) said,specifically, that this matter `cannot be viewed apart from theoverall situation in Europe, which is, as of yet, split into twoalliances.'   ``He appraised the deliberations in the press as an `occupationnot related to practical policy.'''   Gerasimov said, ``If we remain on real ground, any unificationof Germany is out of question now.''   Germany's division into communist East Germany and capitalisticWest Germany followed the collapse of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germanyin World War II. East Germany now is being shaken by mass demandsfor more democracy and by an exodus of East Germans to WestGermany, prompting the changes there this week.   Gerasimov said Thursday that the East German leadership is``improving the situation in the sense that they're moving towardperestroika on their own terms,'' referring to the reformsPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev began on coming to power in 1985.   Millions of Soviets learned in TV, radio and newspaper reportsof the dramatic overhaul of East Germany's ruling Politburo and newleader Egon Krenz's promises of democratic reforms.   Tass quickly reported that the East German government had thrownopen all borders and that its citizens could travel or emigrateanywhere.   Vyacheslav Mostovoy, a correspondent reporting on Soviettelevision's popular nightly news program Vremya, said EastGermany's Central Committee had begun mapping political andeconomic reforms in a ``program which the whole country awaits andon which the future of the republic largely depends.''   Mostovoy, reporting from East Germany, stressed the elevation ofreformers to the Politburo. He quoted Krenz as saying in a speechthat the East German communist party leadership had earlier taken anegative approach to changes in the Soviet Union and othersocialist countries.   Krenz's predecessor, Erich Honecker, had been cool toGorbachev's reforms and resisted implementing them in his owncountry. But Krenz told Gorbachev in a telephone call last monththat ``there are important lessons to be learned from Sovietperestroika in the German Democratic Republic.''   During a visit to Moscow, Krenz discussed possible applicationsin East Germany of Soviet-style reforms.   ``We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process ofperestroika in the Soviet Union,'' he told reporters, adding heespecially wanted to explore its aim of making socialism ``moreattractive.''   In its reports on East German developments, Radio Moscow focusedon that government's plans for a party conference and Krenz's callfor more democracy.   Tass issued at least four reports. One report said the changesthe Central Committee is discussing ``came from the street'' andthat the party must admit its mistakes or lose its right to govern.   Tass ran excerpts of Krenz's 86-page speech Wednesday to theCentral Committee, highlighting his remarks on the formergovernment's hostility toward the Soviet reforms.   It quoted Krenz's condemnation of the old Politburo's ``negativewait-and-see attitude and partly dogmatic and haughty attitude toprocesses taking place in the Soviet Union and other socialistcountries.''   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia also gave readersdetails of Krenz's speech and reported the continuing mass exodusof East Germans.   On Wednesday, Vremya showed Mostovoy standing against thebackdrop of an outdoor public protest in Berlin and describing the``exceptionally important political events'' in East Germany thisweek.   ``The process of reform and renewal that started just a fewweeks ago is continuing with unusual quickness,'' Mostovoy said ina report of about three minutes that came halfway through the45-minute show.</TEXT></DOC>
