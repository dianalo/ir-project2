Now the financial markets may be seeing theemergence of a new movement: bondholder rights.   The recent experience of GAF Corp. when it redeemed several bondissues as part of its plan to go private shows that some bondholdersno longer will sit by passively while a corporation restructures.   When GAF announced it would redeem the bond issues beforematurity as part of its $1.46 billion, management-led buyout, majorinstitutional holders of the securities banded together, hired anadviser and went to battle with the Wayne, N.J., chemical andbuilding-products company until it raised the bond-redemption pricesseveral times.   ``The bondholders were able to receive a reasonable premium andnot have to suffer any losses,'' said Jack Ackerman, president ofBondReview Inc., the adviser to the GAF bondholder group.   In order to undertake the buyout, GAF needed the approval of theholders of three issues of its high-yield, or ``junk,'' bonds.Covenants written into the bond issues required the approval of thebondholders before the company could restructure, Ackerman said.Such covenants typically restrict a company from incurringadditional debt without bondholder approval.   GAF offered to pay the bondholders a fee for their consent todisregard the covenants, and at the same time buy back their bonds.   But some institutional holders of the bonds, primarily insurancecompanies, believed the bonds were worth more than GAF was offering,Ackerman said. With his help, they formed a group and decided not totender their bonds right away.   GAF responded by raising its tender offer, but not by much,Ackerman said.   ``They were testing to find out if a group had been formed,'' hesaid. ``Nobody tendered.''   The bondholder group then negotiated with GAF, and reachedagreement on the price GAF offered for the bonds and for the consentfee, or the amount it paid for bondholders to relinquish their rightto reject GAF's restructuring.   ``By forming these groups and staying together and by areasonable negotiation position with the company, bondholdersincreased their payment by about $20 million'' overall for the threebond issues involved, Ackerman said.   He said the sweetened offers represented improvements rangingfrom 5 percent to 8 percent for each of the bond issues comparedwith the first GAF offers.   GAF refused to comment on the bond redemption. An unidentifiedGAF official told Bondweek, a weekly trade newsletter, that thefinal GAF offer for one of the bond issues ``wound up being moreexpensive than we planned.''   Ackerman said one important reason for bondholders to negotiateas a group is that if the company receives approval from holders of51 percent of its bonds, it can undertake the changes barred by thebond covenants.   For example, he said, if holders of 51 percent of the GAF bondsagreed to give up their covenant rights, holders of the other 49percent would face the prospect that their bonds would be worth lessas the company incurred more debt during a buyout.   ``You've got a potential tyranny of the majority over theminority,'' he said.   Some bond market analysts believe more bondholders will becomemore active in protecting their interests because of corporaterestructurings. In addition to enforcing covenants in existingbonds, investors increasingly are demanding that new issues containcovenants protecting them from managements that load up on debt.   ``Institutional investors are looking at the way things are goingthese days and are deciding not to take a passive attitude,'' saidDavid Blitzer, chief economist for Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., thesecurity-rating company.   Several industry watchers pointed to the recent leveraged buyoutof RJR Nabisco Inc. as a turning point in bondholder awareness.   ``A lot of big investors in R.J. Reynolds thought they had beenunfairly treated,'' Blitzer said. He said RJR had completed a debtissue shortly before the leveraged buyout was announced. ``Peoplethought they were given the short end of the stick.''   The rating of some RJR debt fell after the company'sdebt-financed buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Two major RJRbondholders, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., and ITT Corp.'sinsurance subsidiary, sued the company for alleged damage to thevalue of their investment.   ``Clearly, bondholders are becoming more active in standing upfor their rights, and that has been especially true since the RJRNabisco LBO,'' said Lewis Knox, an executive editor of Bondweek.   ``I don't mean to say that RJR treated its bondholders badly,''he added. ``It was just that people though RJR was a safe betbecause it was so big.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday, March 20</NOTE></DOC>
