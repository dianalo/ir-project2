It was like a thunderbolt. I looked at my greenhouse and itwas flattened,'' he said.   Rail cars had pitched down the steep embankment behind a row ofhouses and come to rest upside down, one of them in Taylor'sbackyard, 30 feet from the house.   At least five people were killed and scores injured when the twoLondon-bound trains from southern England collided at suburbanPurley, about 12 miles south of central London. The reason for thecrash was not immediately known.   ``I went into my garage and I got out two sets of ladders and weused them to try and get up to the carriage doors,'' Taylor said.``but it was difficult because one of the coaches looked as if weput any weight on it at all that it might topple.''   Taylor's 46-year-old son, Andrew, ran out to help.   ``People who were injured were asking `Can you come and help me,please help me,''' he said.   ``I worked on one carriage (rail car), the one in my father'sgarden. A girl was trapped in a luggage rack and, together with aneighbor, I helped her free. I also gave assistance to an elderlylady who had been badly injured and stayed with her until the doctorarrived,'' he said.   One man watched the collision from his bedroom window, shouted tohis wife to call the police, then grabbed a sledgehammer and headedout back with his young son.   Other neighbors gathered up sheets and blankets and clambered upthe high embankment to try to reach the injured.   One woman named Annette said,``My husband went along the gardensand began smashing windows to get people out.''   ``We used ladders as stretchers to carry the people out,'' saidFred Williams. ``The people were just in a big jumble, one on top ofthe other.''   Police soon were on the scene using their truncheons to breakwindows. The sides of the high embankment were so steep thatemergency teams had to haul each other up using ropes secured at thetop.   Doctors had to climb into the rail cars to treat the trappedwhile firefighters cut them free.   Because of the difficulty of getting stretchers to the scene,rescuers used anything flat to carry the injured away _ ladders,even a shed door.   British Rail rescue workers in bright orange coats, andfirefighters in brilliant yellow dotted the muddy rail line.   Meesha Footer, 18, said she saw injured people being brought fromthe mangled railroad cars.   ``I could hear people shouting and groaning,'' she said. ``Therewas a lot of blood and I saw one body covered with a blanket andthere was one man with his leg hanging off.''   Trees growing between the embankment and the houses appeared tohave prevented at least three of the cars from tumbling further downthe embankment into people's homes.   About 20 muddy survivors limped into the nearby Jolly Farmer pub.``There was not much I could do for them except make gallons ofcoffee and let them use the telephone,'' said proprietor NoraO'Connor.</TEXT></DOC>
