Tokyo, London and Frankfurt all turned in winning performances.    Tokyo trading was exceptionally heavy. Dealers said New York's big gain provided the initial impetus for Tuesday's rally, but bullish sentiment born of continuing signs of improvement in Japanese economic fundamentals continued to bring out buyers throughout the day.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which fell 42.06 points Monday, rose 193.09 to close at 25435.90.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index, which gained 0.23 point Monday, rose 11.04 to close at 2089.11. First section volume was estimated at 1.6 billion shares, up from 900 million shares Monday.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, share prices were higher. The Nikkei index rose 121.98 points to 25557.88 at the end of the morning session.    Iron and steel issues posted the best gains in active trading Tuesday. One dealer said the iron and steel sector as a whole rose 2.7%, followed by textiles and chemicals.    Nisshin Steel rose 30 yen to close at 714 yen ($5.50), while Nippon Steel rose 7 to 437 and Kawasaki Steel gained 10 to 385.    Dealers said brokers were active in Tuesday's trading, along with institutions such as life insurance companies.    &quot;The institutionals were out in full force today,&quot; said one trader. He said that because institutional investors are getting back into the market after having a smaller presence than usual for some months, they are moving to buy up the highly liquid large-capital heavy industrials such as steels.    &quot;These are easy shares to get into the market with, and get out of,&quot; he said.    Among heavy industrials, Ishikawajima-Harima rose 19 to 765.    Another trader said that continued strong buying by non-Japanese investors is also helping to drive the current rally. &quot;Foreigners have changed roles. They're buying this market,&quot; he said.    London share prices closed higher, but trading volume remained light.    Dealers said prices mostly held their gains following early markups made on the back of Wall Street's rise. But there was little actual buying going on as investors remained cautious about committing funds to the market, they said.    The Financial Times 30-share index was up 9.6 points at 1439.1. Volume was a modest 405.1 million shares, up from 313.2 million shares Monday. The 100-share index finished 13.1 points ahead at 1781.9.    Most share price movements came as the result of company earnings reports or specific news stories. There wasn't any news that affected the overall market, dealers said.    Standing out among major movers were shares in British Aerospace, which closed 25 pence lower at 329 ($5.83) after plummeting to an intraday low of 308. Hurting the shares was an announcement by Lord Young, British trade and industry secretary, that the company had declared a &quot;serious interest&quot; in acquiring the government's 99.8% shareholding in Rover Group.    The move surprised and confused dealers and analysts, who said the two companies weren't a &quot;natural fit.&quot; Rover Group moved up 15 to 82. Unilever closed 2 pence down at 497 after trading as high as 513 in the morning. The company said pretax profit rose 16% in 1987. Analysts criticized the results, which were at the low end of expectations, because they included a significant increase in profit from property disposals.    Share prices gained in active trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, boosted by gains in New York and Tokyo.    Brokers said domestic investors were considerably more active on the stock exchange floor, contributing to the rise in prices. Foreign investors were net buyers in the earlier part of the session but were seen taking profits toward the close, traders reported.    Dealers said the market remains generally bullish on West German shares. Some uncertainty was detected, however, around midsession, resulting in light retrenchment.    Some export-dependent stocks softened on expectations of a sharp decline in the U.S. January leading indicators, which were released after the trading session ended, brokers said.    Most shares booked moderate increases. The retailer Karstadt led the gainers with a 9-mark rise to 421.5 ($250), while another retailer, Kaufhof, rose 6 to 376.    Among chemical issues, Bayer gained 1.4 to 267, and BASF edged 0.4 mark higher to 246.5, while Schering fell 1 to 442.    Prices fell in Paris, but rose in Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan. The Paris market was hit by afternoon profit-taking, dealers said.    Among Pacific markets, share prices closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore and Wellington, were mixed in Manila and lower in Taipei. The Seoul market was closed.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
