Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu ``froze'' the credentials of RabbiYaacov Avitan, who recently was chosen spiritual leader of BeitShikma, a farming community of about 1,000 in southern Israel,rabbinate spokesman Shmuel Zaafrani said Sunday.   Avitan's ``lack of experience with marital relations'' was amain factor in the decision, said Zaafrani. He explained thatgiving married couples advice about sexual matters was one of arabbi's duties.   ``To do this, he has to know these matters from up close. Adoctor who hasn't done an internship would never be allowed totreat any patients,'' Zaafrani said.   He added that the ruling was more a matter of custom than Jewishlaw. ``It is simply desirable for a rabbi to be married,'' he said.   Avitan is one of the youngest men approved as a rabbi in Israeland believed to be the youngest appointed to the post of communityrabbi. A community rabbi customarily has to be older than 24 andmarried.   Avitan said he agreed with the chief rabbi's decision.   ``He's right. There has to be a certain order to things. It'slike a fresh recruit in the army doesn't become chief of staff in aday,'' Avitan said in an interview.   ``I will wait patiently until my match comes from heaven,'' hesaid.   Eliahu is chief rabbi to Israel's Sephardic community, Jews ofNorth African and Middle Eastern origin.   Sephardic Jews make up about 60 percent of Israel's 3.5 millionJews. Beit Shikma's residents are mainly Jews of Moroccan andLibyan origin.</TEXT></DOC>
