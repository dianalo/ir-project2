 In those days,&quot;office electronics&quot; meant an intercom between boss and secretary, while,&quot;factory information systems&quot; depended on clipboards and pencils.andP;  Computershad barely passed the laboratory curiosity stage and were rarely seen outsidepayroll and accounting in even the most venturesome organizations.andP;  This was,it must be noted,a mere several decades ago.andM;Since then, computerization has expanded the role of technology dramatically,particularly in the movement and management of information.andP;  On a typicalworking day in the late 1980s, for example, computers produce over 600million sheets of printout in the United States alone--some 30 times thedocument output of the human work force.andP;  Computers are everywhere.andP;  Many oftoday's offices contain more microprocessors than people.andM;ComplexityandM;In my own job at ATandamp;T, I see a continuing need to increase links betweenpeople in various parts of the organization to keep pace with technological,advances.andP;  As foreign and domestic competition drives us to seek constantimprovement in our operations, designers can no longer afford to wait until aproduct emerges from a factory before we find out how well it works.andP;  Today,we do a far more integrated Randamp;D job, designing and producing more complexproducts at lower costs and in less time than in the past.andP;  Today, ourengineers and product managers must telescope product specification,functional design, design for manufacture, factory layout, and producttesting into heavily overlapped schedules.andP;  Thus, much of the work goes on atthe same time and puts a huge premium on coordination.andM;Like most of its competitors, ATandamp;T needs fewer people to do a given job thanit used to.andP;  Better coordination eliminates duplication and reduces theamount of rework needed to fix mistakes.andP;  But slimmer organizations aren'tnecessarily simpler.andP;  In my experience, an organization's complexity has lessto do with absolute size than with the amount of dependence between itsvarious functions, and the number of people who hold stakes in a givendecision.andM;When I joined Bell Labs in the early 1960s, the product-realization processwas a sequential series of information hand-offs, plans &quot;mailed&quot; from onegroup to the next.andP;  Today, everyone works from a single design plan thattakes the manufacturing process into account from the start.andP;  This growinglevel of interdependence shows itself in the integrated way we now design andproduce the things we sell.andP;  The extra care pays off by avoiding costlysurprises later, but it means attending a great many meetings.andM;Today, most of the major manufacturing companies I'm familiar with have a mixof excellent, good, and not-so-good factories, but the standard keeps movingupward.andP;  Today's &quot;good&quot; factories would have been judged &quot;excellent&quot; just afew years ago.andP;  Today's best factories operate with a mechanical precisionthat in, say, 1985 I would not have believed possible (or even desirable).andO;Most operations mesh so tightly with their neighbors that an entireproduction line can come to a halt if a single machine breaks down.andM;Until the Japanese taught the industrial world otherwise, factory designerskept their production lines loosely connected.andP;  Conventional widom called for&quot;buffering&quot; operations by providing storage space between each pair ofadjacent stages in the process.andP;  That way, if a particular machine stoppedfor a while, its upstream and downstream neighbors could keep working byfilling and emptying their respective buffers.andM;While this seemingly sensible arrangement kept everyone &quot;busy,&quot; it alsoproduced some unpleasant side effects.andP;  For example, when a particularmachine went out of adjustment, it produced bad products until someonedownstream discovered the problem.andP;  But that didn't happen until all theolder material stored in intervening buffers had been exhausted--and replacedby an equivalent amount of newly made junk.andP;  The bigger the storage, thehigher the cost of each malfunction.andP;  The desire to keep everyone else &quot;busy&quot;when one contributor got into difficulty created problems that we can nolonger afford.andP;  Modern production lines must generally be able to handle amultiplicity of models and shift smoothly from one model to another.andP;  Imaginewhat would happen if most of the machines in an assembly line shifted over toanother product and someone with a supply of items from an earlier jobshipped this now-unwanted material downstream.andM;Until recently, most of us accepted such glitches as the inevitable wasteproducts of mass manufacture, the best one could achieve from the sum of theavailable (individually optimized) parts.andP;  Now, however, competition hasforced electronics producers to stretch toward levels of quality andefficiency achievable only by near-perfect integration of effort across theentire enterprise.andM;When Japanese products first entered the American consumer electronicsmarket, U.S.andP;  manufacturers were caught unprepared.andP;  Many blamed theirtroubles on &quot;cheap overseas labor.&quot;andP;  In reality, however, most Japaneseadvantage flowed from better-engineered factories, which turned outhigher-quality products at lower cost.andP;  American manufacturing methods inthis field proved no match for their competition, and by the mid-1980s everymajor U.S.andP;  producer of consumer electronics was importing virtuallyeverything they sold from overseas.andP;  While some TV sets, radios, taperecorders, and stereos still bore familiar American names--RCA, Sylvania,GE--the small print on their labels invariably indicated foreign manufacture.andM;On the other hand, some American manufacturers have increased their share ofboth domestic and overseas markets.andP;  Black andamp; Decker provides a notableexample.andP;  In the early 1970s, Black andamp; Decker's managementfaced the need toredesign its line of power tools to provide &quot;double insulation&quot;--anadditional insulation barrier to protect users from shock if the maininsulation failed.andP;  While some of the competitors had introduceddouble-insulated products at a 15 to 20 percent premium, Black andamp; Decker'smanagement resolved to use the new design to reduce the cost of its productline.andM;The integration of design engineering and manufacturing was the key elementin achieving this goal.andP;  Manufacturing engineers from every part of theoperation--machine and process development, cost, pruchasing, andpackaging--were brought in to work directly with the design engineeringgroup.andP;  Organizationally, this meant combining manufacturing, productdevelopment, and manufacturing engineering under the newly created positionof vice president of operations.andP;  Through this combined effort, a smallnumber of easily manufactured standardized components were stretched acrossthe entire product line.andP;  For example, a single cylindrically shaped motordesign supplied all needs.andP;  Only the length of the motor had to be varied tomeet the different power requirements of individual tools.andP;  This permitted asingle set of machines to produce all of Black andamp; Decker's motors.andM;By standardizing on a much smaller number of components--such as fasteners,gears, and housings--volumes were increased to levels that justified internalproduction of specialized parts from lower-cost materials.andP;  These newprocesses were also carefully integrated with design.andP;  In the case of gears,for example, bevel gears (cone-shaped gears that work in pairs set at rightangles to each other and calling for precision machining) were eliminated infavor of spur gears, which could be mass produced from powdered metal.andM;The redesign process also called for a large capital investment in newmachinery and the patience to wait for a long-term payoff--some seven yearsfrom the start to the break-even point in the original plan.andP;  When the payofffinally came, Black andamp; Decker benefited handsomely.andP;  From 1967 through 1980the cost of its products fell by well over 50 percent when measured inconstant dollars.andP;  Had Back andamp; Decker retained its 1960s methods, the sameproducts would have cost about five times as much to produce.andM;Black andamp; Decker's integrated approach to the creation of its products led to ashakeout in the domestic power tool industry in which less-preparedproducers--Skil, Stanley, General Electric, Sunbeam, Thor, and Porter Cable,among others--did not survive.andP;  Black andamp; Decker also gained a substantialshare in overseas markets.andP;  As a result, you can find Black andamp; Decker productsin hardware stores around the world, labeled &quot;Made in U.S.A.&quot;andM;Since winners and losers had access to the same technology, &quot;winning throughintegration&quot; was the name of the game and the better integrator came out ontop.andM;At the yet higher level of integration demanded by the production of moresophisticated electronic equipment--such as computers and telecommunicationsgear--high-quality manufacturing is only part of the story.andP;  Producers ofthese items must be prepared to compete across a broad range of productrequirements.andP;  An electric drill or TV set can be used just as it comes outof the box.andP;  A modern telecommunications switching system, on the other hand,must be customized to meet local traffic needs.andP;  It must be able to handlewhatever equipment and signaling and networking arrangements the customershave been using.andP;  Training, maintenance, and a path for future expansion mustbe arranged in advance.andP;  Similarly, the large mainframe computers that storeand control massive databased call for equally complex care and feeding.andM;Since computing and telecommunications share much of the same technology, aswell as portions of the same task (the movement and management ofinformation), many people imagined that expertise in one field would transfereasily into the other.andP;  The news stories following the 1982 breakup of theBell System provide notable examples of such expectations.andP;  Following thebreakup, The New York Times, Business Week, Fortune, and many otherpublications heralded the &quot;Battle of the Giants&quot;--the struggle of ATandamp;T (the&quot;telephone&quot; company) and IBM (the &quot;computer&quot; company) to move into eachother's business.andP;  I particularly rememder the words of one writer wholikened this &quot;struggle&quot; to a wrestling match between two &quot;800-poundgorillas.&quot;andM;The actual event has proven far more mundane.andP;  While both companies have madeattempts to invade each other's territory, nothing much has happened.andP;  Itsimply proved tougher to get into the other business than the pundits hadexpected.andP;  Despite the formidable resources available, neither one couldduplicate enough of the other's organized expertise to make a dent in itscore business.andM;Why?andP;  Basically, the answer lies in people.andP;  These &quot;high-tech&quot; businessescall for the utilization of specialized knowledge in highly sophisticatedareas that go beyond the hardware itself--such as systems engineering, themanagement of large software projects, human factors, and operations support,as well as marketing, sales, and distribution.andP;  Galbraith's &quot;massive andcomplex business organizations&quot; continue to provide our best means forintegrating diverse knowledge inputs and creating a synergistic whole.andP;  As Isee it, the integration of individual expertise is still the name of thegame, and the game still drives the major players to ever greater complexity.andM;ManagersandM;At the same time, the imperatives that drive organizational behavior towardinterdependence also create more work for the middle managers who mustestablish and maintain needed links between cooperating groups.andP;  In addition,as automation reduces the number of lower-level workers needed to perform agiven task, it generally demands more work from the managers that supervisethem.andP;  As I see it, these growing needs for the services that middle managersprovide are the key driving forces behind the dramatic changes taking placein the employee mix of information technology companies.andM;Over the past ten years, for example, a vigorous automation program hasallowed the Travelers Insurance Company to double the amount of business ithandles without increasing its work force.andP;  At the same time, the clericalcomponent of that work force shrunk from two-thirds of the total toone-third, while the professional/managerial component doubled in size.andM;Standardizing Travelers Insurance's computer systems and networking themtogether have reduced the need for manual reformatting of information--suchas typing names and addresses found on one form, or in one database, intoanother.andP;  That cut the need for clerical help.andP;  At the same time, developingand maintaining these integrated systems called for highly trained people,such as computing professionals and systems analysts.andP;  Moreover, theincreased business volume brought with it a proportionate need for morepeople to deal directly with customers and handle the nonroutine componentsof the workload.andP;  Machines can't replace people; they can only take over someof the work that people do.andM;In addition, our growing appetite for technology continues to raise thesophistication and specialization of our work force.andP;  As this processcontinues, I see more managerial effort going into understanding the work ofsubordinates in order to direct their work.andP;  The more knowledge a jobdemands, the more help and expert supervision it requires.andP;  In my own job,Bell Labs research scientists provide a clear example of this need.andP;  Becausemuch of their work is exploratory, subject to unpredictable circumstances andlargely driven by self-motivation, one might think that the best managementcan do is to leave them alone.andP;  In fact, however, quite the opposite is true.andM;Most of the research scientists I know complain if their supervisors don'tunderstand their work in good detail.andP;  As a result, much of each researchmanager's time goes into keeping up with technical developments within theorganization, as well as with related activities elsewhere.andP;  The insight andguidance that these managers provide play a vital role in the success of theresearch process.andP;  I think it's fair to say that similar needs exist in mostwork situations that involve specialized expertise.andM;While technology has generally increased the management workload, it alsooffers help for management by providing easier access to information--as wellas personal aids to information processing.andP;  This latter area includes avariety of computer-based &quot;decision-support&quot; systems.andP;  These softwarepackages handle information-processing chores, such as tracking financialperformance, scheduling airlines, or laying out a network of telephonecables, that highly skilled people (both managers and nonmanagers) formerlyaccomplished manually.andM;My favorite example of an excellent decision-support system comes from a sumowrestling match I happened to watch during a recent trip to Japan.andP;  Anelaborate ceremony preceded each match, after which the contestants tried tobutt or throw their opponents out of a small ring.andP;  The first one to stepoutside the ring or touch the floor with any part of the body other than thesoles of the feet lost the match--often by a fraction of a second.andM;While little in sumo wrestling has changed for centuries, a key piece oftechnology has recently been added.andP;  Before making a close call, thereferee--an elderly gentlemen with lacquered headgear, long pointed mustache,and an elaboratley embroidered silk rote--and his fellow judges now consulttheir &quot;assistant,&quot; a microprocessor-controlled video recorder.andM;For me, the picture of those judges gravely checking through the frames oneby one captured the essence of the proper interplay between the human andmechanical contributions to decision-making.andP;  In many ways, the Japaneseappear more willing to incorporate new technology into their everyday lives,but as this case illustrates, they also maintain a good appreciation of theappropriate division of labor.andP;  Refereeing is, in a sense, amiddle-management activity.andP;  Technology enhances the decision-ranking processby helping people do higher-quality work--making the human decision-maker'sservices more valuable.andM;QualityandM;As the pace of technological advance complicates our environment, it alsoleverages the impact of individual decisions.andP;  Small mistakes, such as anautomobile throttle linkage that sometimes sticks when dirty, can lead tolarge consequences--serious accidents and the recall of millions ofautomobiles.andP;  Consequently, the productive power of technology forces us toshift ever more of our attention from quantity to quality, from how much weproduce to how well we produce it--the whole, rather than the parts.andM;In frontier days, pioneers often burned their houses down when they got readyto move.andP;  They wanted their nails back.andP;  The cost of a handful of componentparts dominated the value of the entire structure and the work that went intobuilding it.andM;Things are a lot different today.andP;  With the exception of a few items that wehaven't learned how to mass produce--such as gem-quality diamonds--individualparts owe most of their value to a role in some larger system.andP;  We rarelynotice parts unless their absence or malfunction causes the system to fail,like a rubber gasket on the Challenger's rocket.andP;  Failure can make aparticular component very expensive indeed.andM;In a world where pieceparts cost little, I see the critical need--as well asthe greatest added value--to rest with the smooth function of an entiresystem, one in which all the parts work together in a trustable fashion.andO;True quality in a modern system demands more than the narrowly definedquality of its individual components.andP;  The quality of the Challenger'sgaskets wasn't the issue.andP;  The gaskets behaved exactly as carefully madepieces of rubber of that shape and composition could be expected to.andP;  Theymaintained airtight seals as long as they were kept warn enough to remainsoft and pliable.andP;  Unfortunately, an unforeseen comibination of chillymorning air and the flow of ultracold gas from the rocket's cryogenic fueltanks changed the ground rules, and disaster struck.andM;In the face of the Challenger disaster, NASA's program was placed undercareful scrutiny.andP;  Our society has yet to demand such a painstaking approachto quality throughout a variety of complex systems in many other fields.andP;  Inparticular, I'm continually struck by how rarely information gets to all theplaces where it's needed.andM;When I began to think about such information shortfalls, I tried to findcosmic reasons for this phenomenon--like a lack of computer literacy or thecost of custom software.andP;  Upon reflection, however, I've settled on a muchsimpler answer.andP;  Shortcomings in the integration of information can crop upwhenever attention to total quality lapses--even when the technology involvedis as simple as a printed page of instructions.andM;Lewis Thomas's autobiography, The Youngest Science: Notes of a MedicineWatcher (Viking, 1983), provides a poignant example of such an isolation ofinformation.andP;  One day in the late 1930s, while working as a junior residentin one of Boston's largest hospitals, Thomas learned of an interesting casefrom a colleague.andP;  A young musician had been admitted that morning with ahistory of chills and fever during the previous week.andP;  The patient's bloodsamples revealed malaria, a disease so unusual in Boston that many on thestaff took specimens for further study.andM;As the day wore on, a growing number of physicians and medical students cameto the patient's bedside to observe this remarkable case for themselves.andP;  Butall this interest didn't help the patient.andP;  The young man became increasinglydrowsy as clumps of infected cells blocked more and more of his brain's bloodvessels.andP;  He fell into a deep coma, and by evening he was dead.andM;Silently, the house physician left the group standing around the bed and soonreturned with a copy of the medical textbook he had fetched from his room.andO;Opening it to the chapter on malaria, he read the following passage to hisassembled colleagues.andP;  &quot;Any doctor who allows a case of malaria to diewithout quinine is guilty of malpractice.&quot;andM;The young musician was an admitted heroin addict.andP;  He had apparently shared aneedle with an infected visitor from a tropical climate.andP;  While the treatmentof malaria had long been part of medical training, none of the attendingphysicians did more than study the unexpected appearance of this disease on awintry day in New England--until it was too late.andM;For each of us, the consequences of information shortfalls can range fromminor inconvenience to ultimate tragedy.andP;  Surely we can do better.andM;Human society can derive much-needed benefits from the quality environmentthat only an integrated sharing of information can provide.andP;  As I see it, weneed an integrated approach to quality, one that defines and realizes theperformance of each system in its entirety, rather than the small-scalebehavior of its pieceparts.andP;  Technology that is measured by its total impacton the human beings it serves provides a worthy goal for the information age.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
