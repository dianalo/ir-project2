(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Top House Democrats, leadingtheir members to a weekend retreat at the luxurious Greenbrierresort, tried to put the onus on the Senate Friday as they facedheat over Speaker Jim Wright's plan to let a 51 percentcongressional pay raise take effect, at least temporarily, next week.   But many lawmakers doubted Wright's gambit _ letting the raiseautomatically go through and then having the House vote to cut itback to 30 percent _ would end public demand for rescinding theentire $45,500 pay increase.   Rep. Tony Coelho, the House majority whip, told reporters theSenate's 95-5 vote Thursday to reject the pay raise was an easy onethat left the difficult decision to the House.   ``We intend to send that (30 percent increase) over to theSenate, those folks over there who are very strong willed, and we'llstand up and see what they do and see if they're interested in a 50percent increase or not,'' he said.   ``We're taking the heat and they're not,'' he said, defending theneed for a pay increase or some sort.   The chairman of the House Democratic organization, Rep. WilliamH. Gray III, D-Pa., said the Senate was ``wanting it both ways _keeping honoraria and after-hours (earnings) while appearing to bepure on the pay raise.''   The pay raise, which would increase rank-and-file congressionalsalaries from $89,500 to $135,000, takes effect Wednesday unless theHouse joins the Senate before then in voting to kill it.   In Washington, meanwhile, a group of Republicans were planning toforce a House vote Monday on the pay raise.   The group planned to offer a resolution calling on Wright to holda vote on the pay raise before it goes into effect. The draftresolution asserted that ``the dignity of the House ofRepresentatives is being sullied from coast to coast'' because ofWright's failure to schedule a vote.   If the leadership declines to allow an immediate vote on theresolution, proponents would call for a vote to override the rulingand seek to construe that vote, which could be forced withoutmajority approval, as a test vote on the pay increase, according toGOP aides.   The move is being led by Reps. Robert Smith, R-N.H., and WilliamDannemeyer, R-Calif.   On the train ride here, Coelho and other Democratic leaders andaides worked to explain Wright's decision, which blocks a votebefore the raise takes effect. Many of the 142 House Democrats,accompanied by their families to the resort, wondered aloud whetherthe speaker's strategy, which could keep the pay fight going forweeks or months, was wise.   ``The opponents of the pay raise will try a repeal every twoweeks until Christmas eve,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.   ``I have never received such vicious mail,'' said Rep. BillRichardson, D-N.M. He said constituents were promising to voteagainst him even if the pay raise took effect over his objections.   Richardson said he understood Wright's position, but said ``itwill not help because 30 percent and 50 percent are still viewed asexcessive and the public doesn't understand honorariums.''   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who has been working with thebipartisan House leadership on the pay issue and a companion measureto ban members from taking speaking fees or other honoraria,declined to criticize the speaker's plan but said he doubted itwould defuse the situation.   The issue caters to ``trash television and talk radio. If theyhad their way, this wuld go on for months,'' he said. ``It couldbecome a far more dominant issue than it has been already,'' he said.   Williams said he thought Wright's plan would still be seen as away to protect a raise while the public wanted none. ``And the 50percent will be repealed,'' he predicted.   The lawmakers were reminded of the public outcry at the outset oftheir trip, as their buses arrived at the side door of Union Stationto avoid a protest. And along the way, a prominent trackside signread: ``Spike the Pay Hike.''   Privately, members also worried that Wright's strategy would notonly fail to net them a pay raise, but cost them their income fromhonoria as well. The ban on accepting those fees would go intoeffect immediately in the House, and if the pay raise were rolledback it would be politically embarassing to then repeal thehonoraria ban.   Speaker Wright, D-Texas, and the House's second-ranked Democrat,Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., were not on the trainbecause of a White House meeting Friday morning. They were flying tothe resort later Friday to join their colleagues for the weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
