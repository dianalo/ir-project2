Although the absoluteairborne asbestos levels were very low, Category (3) had the highestmedian levels followed by Category (2), Category (1), and outdoors. Category(3) levels were significantly higher than Category (1). Another objectivewas to field test an assessment method for ACM developed facilitate abatementdecision making in the context of an asbestos-management program. Usingrate consistency as an evaluation criterion, the three factors showedpromise as assessment tools for use in the field. Each factor showedstatistically significant consistency among raters.</TEXT></DOC>
