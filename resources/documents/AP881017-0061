CLOUD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Warm weather, the party atmospheresurrounding homecoming weekend and increased alcohol consumptionhave been blamed for two nights of rioting at St. Cloud StateUniversity.   ``The catalyst for this whole thing was a lot of young peoplewith a lot of booze in them,'' Assistant Police Chief Jim Molinesaid Sunday. ``They're not experienced enough with alcohol and theyjust go kind of crazy.''   Things were quiet Sunday night, authorities said.   But the previous night, police clad in riot gear clashed withstudents and others who burned furniture and a trash bin that hadbeen dragged into the street. Sixty people were arrested, including34 students, police said. On Friday night, two people were arrested.   At least six people, including a police officer, were treated ata hospital for minor injuries suffered Saturday night and earlySunday, said hospital nursing supervisor Patricia Anderson.   Students set off firecrackers and some played the Beatles' song``Revolution'' on a stereo as police swept through the crowd,estimated at about 700 people, Saturday night. Other people toredown street signs and jumped on cars, or threw beer bottles andpieces of lumber.   In all, as many as 1,500 people converged on a four-block areaboth Friday and Saturday nights, Moline said.   Brendan McDonald, president of the 16,500-student campus, andseveral students said numerous out-of-towners came to St. Cloud tolook for parties after Friday night's disturbance.   ``Once it hit the news media, it was like an open invitation,''McDonald said. ``Some people will go any distance for a party.''   While authorities blamed the violence on the rioters, somestudents said police aggravated the situation by using excessiveforce.   ``Both sides took it too far,'' said student Kevin Stanek.   But Moline praised officers for their handling of thedisturbance. ``In situations like this, people have a tendency tosay things that look to the public like they (police) areinsensitive,'' he said.   Moline said that in his 31 years on the city police force, theweekend's violence could be topped only by demonstrations againstthe Vietnam War in the 1960s.   The two people arrested Friday night probably will be chargedwith felony assault for throwing beer bottles, Moline said. Thosearrested Saturday are likely to be charged with misdemeanors, hesaid.   McDonald met with school officials Sunday to discuss the riots,and university spokesman Angelo Gentile said a task force would beappointed to investigate. University fraternities and sororitiessponsored a cleanup rally Sunday afternoon.   Gentile said the university has no jurisdiction over privaterooming houses near campus that were the source of some of thetrouble.</TEXT></DOC>
