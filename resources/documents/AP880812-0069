British diplomat David Reddaway arrived in Tehran today fortalks about the hostages. It is Britain's first diplomatic visit toIran in a year.   Those developments, along with meetings in London between anIranian envoy and Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, raisednew hopes for the release of the three Britons held hostage inLebanon.   ``I think it is bound to help,'' Reddaway, a senior official atthe British Foreign Ministry, said of his Tehran visit. Speakingbefore leaving from Heathrow Airport, he said that while in Iran heplanned to assess the possibility of Britain resuming diplomaticties.   Britain withdrew its diplomats from Iran a year ago after onewas beaten up in apparent reprisal for the arrest of an Iranianenvoy in England on shoplifting charges.   Neither the Iranian Embassy nor Runcie, who left for athree-week vacation in Philadelphia, would comment on Runcie'sWednesday night talks with Mohamed Reza Said Mohamedi, an IranianForeign Ministry official.   Runcie is the spiritual head of the Church of England. Churchenvoy Terry Waite is among the three British hostages.   An Anglican bishop went to Lebanon last month to initiateinquiries about the fate of four Iranians believed kidnapped byChristians in Lebanon.   A statement from the Iranian Embassy, released Thursday night,said:   ``1. Any attempt in locating the Iranian hostages in Lebanonwould be appreciated by the entire people of Iran.   ``2. We are sincerely exploring the possibilities and ways ofmutual assistance in tracing non-Iranian hostages in Lebanon.   ``3. We fully share the views expressed by the archbishop ofCanterbury and appreciate his initiatives in solving this problem.''   Pro-Iranian extremists are believed to hold 18 foreigners,including nine Americans, hostage in Lebanon. The Hezbollahfaction, over which the Iranian government wields considerableinfluence, is believed to be the umbrella organization for groupsholding the hostages.   Waite disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying tosecure the release of hostages.   The other Britons missing are television journalist JohnMcCarthy, who was kidnapped April 17, 1986, and teacher BrianKeenan from Northern Ireland, who has been missing since April 11,1986. Keenan holds British and Irish nationality.   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16,1985.   The Foreign Office said the catalyst for sending a diplomat toTehran was Iran's agreement July 18 to accept a U.N. cease-fire inits war with Iraq.   A British Broadcasting Corp. Middle East correspondent, KeithGraves, reported that the agreement had led to control of thehostages being passed from Hezbollah to a group of ``hard-lineIranian Revolutionary Guards.''   Graves said the hard-liners opposed Hashemi Rafsanjani, head ofIran's armed forces, because of his agreement to a cease-fire andhis ``willingness'' to have the foreign hostages released fromLebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
