Ballasts operate at various levels of energy efficiency.The standards set in NAECA 88 will phase out the least efficient ballasts.The remaining ballasts, which all manufacturers make, are typically tento fifteen percent more efficient. The more efficient ballasts run cooler,last longer and deliver the same quantity and quality of light.Since it is estimated that approximately ten percent of the nation's electricityis consumed by fluorescent lighting, most of which is installed in officeand institutional buildings,\4\<NOTE/> there is a tremendous opportunity for energy savings. TheAmerican Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (``ACEEE'') in Washington,DC, estimates that there are over fifty million new ballasts sold eachyear. Each higher efficiency ballast saves ten to twenty-four watts. ACEEEestimates that NAECA 88 will reduce the need for new electric generatingcapacity by 7,000 megawatts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ S. Rep. No. 100-345, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1988).The initial cost of the more efficient ballasts is slightly higher, andthe typical payback will take approximately two years. But ACEEE estimatesthat, because ballasts last from twelve to fifteen years, NAECA 88 willsave consumers eleven billion dollars by the year 2000 and sixteen billiondollars by the year 2010. There will be additional savings because of thereduced cooling load in buildings and the reduced need to build new powerplants.<ITAG tagnum="84">NAECA 88 Requirements</ITAG>Standards and TestingNAECA 88 amends EPCA/NAECA 87 \5\<NOTE/> by establishing minimum energy efficiency standards for fluorescentlamp ballasts. The standards will apply only to the four most commonlyused fluorescent lamp ballasts, which make up approximately 85% of theballast market.\6\<NOTE/> The standards will take effect in phases, with manufacturersof ballasts having to comply with respect to ballasts manufactured afterJanuary 1, 1990, sold after April 1, 1990 or incorporated into lamps byApril 1, 1991. NAECA 88 also directs DOE to establish a testing procedurefor ballasts. The labeling rules the FTC must prescribe, however, are notdependent upon DOE's promulgation of this procedure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ NAECA 87 set minimum energy efficiency standards for 11major home appliances and preempted any state standards for those products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The ballasts affected are those that operate at a nominalinput voltage of 120 or 277 volts, with an input current frequency of 60Hertz, and are for use with one (or two) F40T12 lamps (40 watts, 48 byone and one-half inches), two F96T12 lamps (75 watts, 96 by one and one-halfinches) or two F96T12HO lamps (110 watts, 96 by one and one-half inches).LabelingNAECA 88 directs the Federal Trade Commission to amend the Appliance LabelingRule to require disclosure that ballasts meet the minimum efficiency standardsset by NAECA 88. The legislation specifically requires that the disclosurebe in the form of a capital letter ``E'' printed within a circle on theballast and on the packaging of the ballast or the lamp containing theballast.\7\<NOTE/> Further, NAECA 1988 gives the Commission the option to requirethat any information required on the label also be disclosed in any printedmatter displayed or distributed at the point of sale of such ballasts.Sec. 2(d)(3), 102 Stat. 673.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ (B) The Commission shall prescribe labeling rules underthis section applicable to the covered products specified in paragraph(13) of section 322(a) and to which standards are applicable under section325. Such rules shall provide that the labeling of any fluorescent lampballast manufactured on or after January 1, 1990, will indicate conspicuously,in a manner prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) by July 1,1989, a capital letter ``E'' printed within a circle on the ballast andon the packaging of the ballast or of the luminaire into which the ballasthas been incorporated. Sec. 2(d)(1), 102 Stat. 672.The Commission is required by the statute to have the amendments in placeby July 1, 1989. The rule, however, will only apply to products manufacturedon or after January 1, 1990. Under section 336(a) of EPCA,\8\<NOTE/> the Commission must prescribe amendments to its ApplianceLabeling Rule in accordance with the notice-and-comment requirements ofsection 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act,\9\<NOTE/> except that interested persons must be afforded an opportunityfor a hearing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 42 U.S.C. 6306.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 5 U.S.C. 553.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Amendments</ITAG>Although NAECA 88 adds fluorescent lamp ballasts to the list of coveredproducts under EPCA, its substantive requirements are significantly morelimited than those for the other products covered by the Rule. To preventthe new status of fluorescent lamp ballasts as a ``covered product'' fromtriggering other requirements of the existing Rule, the Commission proposesa number of minor amendments to adjust the Rule. These minor amendments,which reconcile the Rule's existing labeling requirements with the simplifiedapproach taken with fluorescent lamp ballasts, are to the following sectionsof the Rule:<ITAG tagnum="25">Section 305.1(a) Scope of the Regulations in this Part</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 305.2 (n), (o) and (p) Definitions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 305.3(j) Description of Covered Products to Which This PartApplies</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 305.4(e)(2) Prohibited Acts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 305.5 and (i) Determinations of Estimated Annual Energy Costand Energy Efficiency Rating</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 305.10(a) Ranges of Estimated Annual Energy Costs and EnergyEfficiency Ratings </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 305.16 Required Testing by Designated Laboratory</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 305.18 (i) and (j) When the Rule Takes Effect.</ITAG>The minor changes to these sections are identified in Section G of thisNotice, which contains the text of the proposed amendments. A discussionof the substantive amendments and other substantive considerations appearsbelow.Section 305.8 Submission of DataSection 326 of EPCA, which is unchanged by the NAECA 88 amendments, requiresmanufacturers of covered products to submit to the Commission ``relevant''energy usage data and starting serial numbers pertaining to their products.\1\\0\<NOTE/> These requirements are repeated in andSection; 305.8 of theRule. The Commission uses this information to establish and maintain theranges of comparability and for enforcement purposes with respect to thehousehold appliances presently covered by the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The requirement for reporting starting serial numbersis found in secton 326(b)(1) (42 U.S.C. 6296(b)(1)) and the requirementfor reporting relevant energy consumption data is found in section 326(b)(4)(42 U.S.C. 6296(b)(4)).The Commission proposes excluding manufacturers of fluorescent lamp ballastsfrom these requirements because the Commission has been told by industrysources that these products do not have serial numbers and because theCommission believes that energy usage information for these products isnot ``relevant,'' as contemplated by the statute. The Commission has concludedthat the information would not be ``relevant'' for two reasons. First,the labels for fluorescent lamp ballasts will not disclose ranges for theseproducts, since the statutory labeling requirement does not include thedisclosure of ranges, so the information would not be used for compilingranges. Second, in this situation, the information probably would not bevery helpful to the Commission for law enforcement purposes. Congress anticipatedthe possibility that, prior to the January 1, 1990, manufacturing cutoffdate, some manufacturers might legally produce and ``stockpile'' ballaststhat do not comply with the standards for sale after the amendments takeeffect. To limit this, the minimum efficiency standards to be set by DOEwill apply to all fluorescent lamp ballasts sold on or after April 1, 1990or incoporated into luminaires on or after April 1, 1991.To ensure that there are no other reasons for manufacturers of these productsto submit energy usage data to the Commission, the Commission seeks commenton whether, and for what reason, such submissions should be made. The Commissionis also interested in receiving suggestions on what method to use to determinethe date of manufacture of fluorescent lamp ballasts for enforcement purposes,since the use of starting serial numbers (which can be used with otherproducts covered by the Commission's Rule) will not be possible with fluorescentlamp ballasts.Section 305.11(d) Labeling for Covered ProductsThe Commission has added a new subsection_andSection; 305.11(d)_to the sectionon labeling in order to set out the manner in which the encircled capital``E'' logo must be disclosed. The proposed language contains no referencesto the specific size or style of the lettering to be used for two reasons.First, section 324(a)(2)(B) of EPCA (as amended by NAECA 88) indicatesonly that fluorescent lamp ballasts are to be labeled ``conspicuously''in a manner prescribed by the Commission.'' The statute does not specificallyrequire the Commission to specify items such as type size and face. Second,these products are seldom seen or purchased by consumers, and since thedisclosure itself communicates no comparative numerical information, extremelyspecific regulatory requirements seem unnecessary.For these reasons, the Commission has drafted the regulation to incorporatethe statutory criterion of a ``conspicuous'' disclosure coupled with severaloptions as to how and where the disclosure must be made. Since all fluorescentlamp ballasts are labeled with a stick-on label that discloses the UL mark,the manufacturer's name, a catalog number, a wiring diagram, voltage, Hertzand other information, most manufacturers will probably take the optionof disclosing the logo on the label. The other options are using a separatelabel or indelibly stamping the ballast itself. The disclosure must bemade on the surface of the ballast that is normally labeled, and in color-contrastingink.The requirement for disclosing the logo on packaging for individual ballastsand luminaires parallels the disclosure requirements for ballasts themselves.The disclosure must be made on the surface on which printing normally appears,and may be in the form of a separate label or an addition to an existinglabel, or printing or an indelible stamp on the package itself. If thepackage contains printing on more than one surface, the label must appearon the surface that contains the product's specifications. The Commissionhas learned that the majority of fluorescent lamp ballasts and luminairesare packaged by the pallet load, usually wrapped in plastic sheeting, or``shrink-wrap.'' Such loads are often accompanied by documentation underthe shrink-wrap that contains descriptive product information. To ensurethat the logo is disclosed conspicuously under these circumstances, thisproposed section requires that the logo appear ``conspicuously'' on thepackaging, the shrink-wrap and the accompanying documentation. Again, theoptions for the method of disclosure are a separate label, printing orstamping with indelible ink.Since the Commission's gathering of information relating to this industry'spractices concerning packaging and marketing is only in the preliminarystage, the Commission seeks comment on the appropriateness of the disclosureapproach taken in this section. Specifically, the Commission is askingfor conments on whether the requirement should be more specific as to thesize, design and placement of the logo, and if so, what specificationswould be appropriate. The Commission also solicits information about allaspects of the packaging of these products and is interested in receivingsuggestions concerning the most effective method of labeling the packages.Section 305.13 Promotional Material Displayed or Distributed at Point ofSaleThe NAECA 88 amendments do not affect the Commission's authority to requirecertain disclosures in connection with the use, by manufacturers of coveredproducts, of point-of-sale promotional materials. As noted above, the Commissionhas been informed that fluorescent lamp ballasts and luminaires containingthem are infrequently bought at retail and promotional materials are rarely,if ever, used. Therefore, the Commission has excluded manufacturers ofthese products from the requirements of andSection; 305.13 of the Rule, eventhough section 324(c)(4) of EPCA grants the Commission the authority toinclude them.In order to confirm that these products are not sold through the use ofsuch promotional materials, however, the Commission wishes to know whether,and to what extent, such materials are used by the industry.Section 305.14 CatalogsSection 326(a) of EPCA, which is unaffected by NAECA 88, requires thatif a manufacturer of a covered product advertises the product in a catalog,the catalog must display all the information required on the label, unlessotherwise required by the Commisison. The Commission has learned that theseproducts are sold to builders, distributors and retailers through catalogs.The Commission has, therefore, included manufacturers of fluorescent lampballasts in the requirements of this section of the Rule, and ballast manufacturersmust display the logo in connection with the product description for eachcovered ballast they include in their catalogs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section A_Invitation To Comment</ITAG>All interested persons are hereby notified that they may comment on anyissue of fact, law or policy that may have bearing upon the proposed rules.While the Commission welcomes comments on any aspect of the proposed rules,there are questions that appear at the end of the discussions of the proposedamendments themselves. All comments and testimony should be referencedspecifically to either the Commission's questions or the section of theproposed rules being discussed.The Commission requests that commenters provide representative factualdata. Individual firms' experiences are relevant to the extent they typifyindustry experience, in general, or that of similar-sized firms. Commentsopposing the proposed rules or specific provisions should, if possible,suggest a specific alternative. Proposals for alternative regulations shouldinclude reasons and data that indicate why the alternatives would betterserve the purposes of the proposed rules. Comments should be supportedby a full discussion of all the relevant facts and/or be based directlyon firsthand knowledge, personal experience or general understanding ofthe particular issues addressed by the proposed rules.Before adopting these proposed rules as final rules, consideration willbe given to any written comments timely submitted to the Presiding Officerand on the record of the hearing, if one is held. Comments submitted willbe available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of InformationAct (5 U.S.C. 552) and Commission Regulations, on normal business daysbetween the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Public Reference Room130, Federal Trade Commission, 6th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington,DC 20580.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section B_Public Hearings </ITAG>Persons desiring a public hearing on the proposed amendments should notifythe Presiding Officer by no later than February 2, 1989. If there is interestin a hearing, it will take place in Room 532 of the Federal Trade Commission,Pennsylvania Avenue at Sixth Street, Northwest, Washington, DC, at a timeand date that will be announced in a subsequent notice. If a hearing isheld, persons desiring an appointment to testify will be required to submitto the Presiding Officer a complete statement in advance. This will beentered into the record in full. However, as a general rule, oral statementsshould not exceed ten minutes. There will be no opportunity for interestedpersons to cross-examine witnesses. Further instructions to witnesses willbe contained in the notice announcing the hearing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section C_Motions or Petitions </ITAG>Any motions or petitions in connection with this proceeding must be filedwith Henry B. Cabell, the Presiding Officer, who is responsible for theorderly conduct of the proceeding and who shall have all powers necessaryto that end, including the authority to rule on all motions or petitionsfiled. Applications for review of a rule will not be entertained by the Commissionprior to its review of the record unless the Presiding Officer certifiesin writing to the Commission that a ruling involves a controlling questionof law or policy as to which there is substantial ground for differenceof opinion and that an intermediate review of the ruling may materiallyadvance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or that subsequent reviewwill be an inadequate remedy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section D_Post-Comment-Period or Post-Hearing Procedures</ITAG>Interested persons will be afforded 20 days after the close of the hearing,or the close of the comment period if no hearing is held, to file rebuttalsubmissions, which must be based only upon identified, properly cited mattersalready in the record. The Presiding Officer will reject all submissionsthat are essential additional written comments, rather than rebuttal. Ifa hearing is held, the 20-day rebuttal period will commence when the finaltranscript of the hearing is placed on the public record by the PresidingOfficer.After the close of the rebuttal period, staff will analyze the evidenceon the record and prepare and submit a recommendation for the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section E_Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an initialregulatory analysis (5 U.S.C. 603-604) are not applicable to this documentbecause it is believed the amendments, if promulgated, ``will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities''(5 U.S.C. 605).The requirement that lamp ballasts and lamp ballast packaging bear theencircled ``E'' logo is statutorily imposed and the proposed regulationswill impose few additional costs. The statutory disclosure requirementitself will result in only minimal cost to the industry.Because these changes are not likely to have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act and the rules implementing it, the Commission believesthat a regulatory analysis is unnecessary. This conclusion is based oninformation presently available to the Commission and its staff. The Commissionrequests any information on whether the amendments proposed today wouldhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.After receiving comments, the Commission will decide whether the preparationof a final regulatory flexibility analysis is warranted.In light of the above, it is certified, under the provisions of section5 of the Regulatory Flexibilty Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that the proposedregulations, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section F_Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The amendments proposed today are not subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct (``PRA''), 44 U.S.C. 3501-3518, because they do not contain disclosureor reporting requirements that constitute the ``collection of information''as defined by the rule implementing the PRA. This is because the all ofthe information that must be disclosed (the encircled ``E'') is providedby the government and the industry does not have the collect informationin order to develop the disclosure.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\``The public disclosure of information originally suppliedby the Federal government to the recipient for the purpose of disclosureto the public is not included within th[e] definition [of information collection].''5 CFR 1320.7(c)(2) (1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 305</ITAG>Advertising, Energy conservation, Household appliances, Labeling, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section G_Proposed Amendments </ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Commission proposes to amendTitle 16, Part 305 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 305_RULES FOR USING ENERGY COSTS AND CONSUMPTION INFORMATIONUSED IN LABELING AND ADVERTISING FOR CONSUMER APPLIANCES </ITAG>1.
