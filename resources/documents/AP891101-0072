All but one of 28 women jabbed between Oct. 21 and Oct. 27 onthe city's diverse Upper West Side were white, and the attackerswere black teen-agers or young women.   None of the victims has been seriously hurt, and police haveminimized fears of infection with AIDS, hepatitis or other diseases.   ``I would doubt if it was a hypo needle,'' said Capt. MauriceCollins. ``These are very quick jabs, for somebody to be injectinganybody with a hypo needle would take time.   ``It could be any kind of a sharp object, it could be a needle,it could be a brooch pin, it could be a compass point, somethingthat's sharp enough to prick the skin. ... The wounds are basicallyshallow,'' Collins said.   Collins, who heads the department's Bias Incident squad, said,``The victims are selected, it appears that they're selected on thefact that they're white.''   Most of the women were walking alone on the street in theevening and ``were approached usually from behind. They felt apricking as the black female teen-agers passed them, they observedlaughing and giggling,'' Collins said.   No remarks have been made during most of the attacks. However,in one of the assaults, a teen-ager cursed her victim, and inanother case, a teen-ager was heard to say, ``We're going to cutyour hair off,'' the captain said.</TEXT></DOC>
