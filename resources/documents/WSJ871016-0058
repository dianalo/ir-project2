Despite bright prospects for an arms-control agreement and a continuing economic expansion, the administration seems increasingly paralyzed after its bloody battle to appoint Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. With 15 months yet to go in the administration, the signs are all around:    --State Department professionals widely consider foreign policy to be in a holding pattern except on arms control.    --The administration's highly publicized AIDS commission is in disarray.    --Health Department bureaucrats grumble that a distracted White House has bungled the fight over costly catastrophic-illness insurance.    --Labor Department aides fret over a lack of high-level lobbying on legislation.    --Another cabinet secretary is leaving, and the general counsels of five cabinet-level agencies have bailed out or soon will.    President Reagan is &quot;in some danger of becoming another Jimmy Carter,&quot; says Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a right-wing Republican. The White House, Rep. Gingrich complains, isn't giving clear signals. &quot;The result,&quot; he declares, &quot;is the self-imposed debilitation of the Reagan presidency. None of us on the Hill knows what to expect in any given week.&quot;    This sense of a creeping paralysis first arose almost a year ago with the disclosure of the Iran-Contra scandal. But now President Reagan's own uncompromising mood on a range of policy issues, combined with the long fight over Judge Bork's confirmation, has deepened the impression.    Moreover, the prospects for a full recovery aren't bright. Congress is in the hands of the Democrats, who are newly energized by the Bork fight. They will soon try, in line with revived deficit-cutting legislation, to force President Reagan to swallow defense cuts or tax increases he adamantly opposes. Yet Mr. Reagan gives no sign that he will work his way out of the jam by compromising on taxes. He is likely to simply veto an entire defense bill and other spending measures when they reach him.    &quot;I find it quite startling that the administration just isn't seeming to bounce back vigorously,&quot; says Fred Greenstein, a scholar at Princeton University who studies the presidency. By contrast, he says, Dwight Eisenhower, the last president to serve two full terms, saw his image reach &quot;its highest levels in the last two years.&quot;    Of course, the administration will soon bask in the glow of a completed arms treaty with the Soviet Union and a late-autumn summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, two events that the administration now counts on more than ever to refurbish its image. Indeed, this pending diplomatic breakthrough and the continuing economic expansion -- which has just set a record for sustained postwar growth -- leave many administration officials arguing that their plight isn't as bad as it seems after the Bork battle.    &quot;I remember being here with Gerald Ford in the last year, and we were much more on the defensive and had to govern by veto,&quot; says Treasury Secretary James Baker, who remains an effective operator.    White House aides assert they will be successful if they can merely block the Democratic Congress from passing big tax or spending bills or gouging the defense budget. Some aides think the most important thing right now is for Mr. Reagan to fight on to uphold his basic beliefs, even if that means suffering some defeats.    &quot;Even when we may lose, I think it's important that we proceed,&quot; says Gary Bauer, assistant to the president for policy development. &quot;You remind people what the other side stands for.&quot;    And as long as President Reagan can portray himself as a deal maker with the Soviets -- and the economic expansion continues, easing some of the worries that have undoubtedly contributed to Wall Street's recent slide -- his personal popularity may remain high.    But few dispute that the administration's vacillating performance in the Bork fight has both illuminated and exacerbated its weakness. &quot;They don't have a rudder,&quot; asserts Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster. Adds John Deardourff, a Republican consultant: &quot;It seems to me that at least in terms of domestic policy and domestic politics, the Bork chapter really does bring the Reagan years to an end.&quot;    Side effects of the Bork battle can already be seen. The Labor Department, for example, has been fighting a bill in the House requiring that workers be notified, in some cases, when they may be exposed to toxic chemicals or radiation. The House passed the bill over the administration's objections yesterday. Ordinarily, the department might have enlisted White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker to lobby against the bill. But with the White House distracted by the Bork fight, says a Labor official, the department determined it had &quot;no shot&quot; of getting such help and didn't seek it.    The administration's general inability to move Congress causes retreats on other legislative fronts as well. The Justice Department has virtually abandoned efforts to slash federal financing for some juvenile-delinquency and victims-assistance programs. The Agriculture Department seems content to simply administer a 1985 farm bill rather than seek any changes. &quot;Stay the course is the term they use,&quot; says Martin Sorkin, an agricultural consultant.    And as the 1988 election campaigns heat up, the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to put on hold President Reagan's nominations of dozens of federal judges.    Similarly, administration aides acknowledge that the budget proposal they are preparing for release next February is likely to have little relationship to what is ultimately enacted in an election year -- and as a result demoralization is setting in at the Office of Management and Budget.    One policy maker in the Department of Health and Human Services grouses that administration decisions are &quot;random policy actions by a bunch of lightweights.&quot; He predicts the administration will lose its battle to scale back an expensive plan for catastrophic-illness insurance working its way through Congress.    Many of Mr. Reagan's advisers are sure to recommend that he simply veto the health-insurance bill, and some advisers may urge a veto, too, of a big trade bill now being put together. Indeed, as Congress flexes its muscles more, the administration's only power may be the &quot;power to veto and block and create a stalemate,&quot; says Michael Bromberg, the executive director of the Federation of American Hospitals and an experienced administration watcher.    Administration lethargy is also felt in foreign policy. Just two months ago, the administration still was ambitious enough to launch a peace feeler in Central America. But that effort has backfired: It has been upstaged by a peace plan put forth by Central American leaders and has undercut congressional support for Nicaragua's Contra rebels. Now senior State Department aides say they detect little interest in new policy initiatives around the world that would be controversial or require high-level pushing.    For instance, State Department officials who are busy drawing up a new strategy for negotiating with the Soviets over cuts in conventional arms in Europe worry that they may be involved in a pointless bureaucratic exercise.    Europeans strongly believe that such a new strategy is needed to address the imbalance between Soviet and Western conventional forces, which will become more troublesome after the pending arms agreement removes intermediate-range nuclear arms now defending Western Europe. But initiating such a strategy would require deep presidential involvement and tense consultations with allies, and State Department officials suspect that the White House doesn't want to get involved.    In other areas of slow-moving diplomacy, such as the Middle East peace process, the administration is reluctant to begin anything that it may not have time to finish, foreign-policy officials say. And they say that because there haven't been any terrorist incidents recently to refocus attention on the area, some of the steam has gone out of the administration's counterterrorism strategy. In the Persian Gulf, however, the administration is sticking with its policy of providing military escorts for Kuwaiti oil tankers even though that mission is becoming more difficult as many congressmen clamor for a cutback in the American exposure there.    Some State Department officials say that the White House doesn't want to carry out normal rotation of ambassadors for fear the politically powerful friends of some appointees who are moved out of their posts might stir up a fuss, which the administration doesn't need now. The slowdown, combined with deep budget reductions that are forcing the State Department to cut back the Foreign Service, is deflating department morale. &quot;This place,&quot; says one senior State Department official, &quot;is in a quiet state of turmoil.&quot;    The administration's slowdown is likely to worsen as some of its most skilled and experienced operators jump ship in the final months. A notable example: Labor Secretary William Brock is departing to manage Sen. Robert Dole's presidential campaign.    On economic policy, the White House is forced to lean heavily on Treasury Secretary Baker, who is a leader on issues as disparate as a trade agreement with Canada, the pending trade bill in Congress and negotiations on Third World debt. But he is stretched thin. Richard Darman, when he departed as deputy Treasury secretary earlier this year, was replaced by M. Peter McPherson, who isn't considered a heavyweight by comparison. Now Robert Kimmitt, the Treasury's general counsel and an important troubleshooter for Mr. Baker, is leaving to join a law firm.    Nor is the lawyer exodus limited to the Treasury. General counsels at the Office of Management and Budget, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Energy and Commerce departments have left or are getting ready to go.    Some supporters of President Reagan would like to see him move his administration out of its rut by showing more willingness to compromise with Congress on issues like tax increases to close the budget deficit. William Lilly, the executive director of the American Business Conference, says the companies he represents &quot;are getting tougher and tougher lectures from international lenders who say, 'What is wrong with your government? You can't continue this way. Your house has to be put in order.'&quot;    (Revised WSJ Oct. 19, 1987)   (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Polly Gault&quot; -- WSJ Oct. 19, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
