That complaint requests thatthe Commission investigate and report its findings as to whether the continuedapplication of the Private Express Statutes (39 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) to advertising mail is consistent with the policies ofthe Postal Reorganization Act. The Commission issued Order No. 804 thefollowing day, setting a date for the Postal Service's answer to the complaint.That Order also solicited intervention notices from interested partiesapplicable to any proceeding that might result from the complaint, butdid not set a deadline for intervention. The Postal Service filed an answer to the TCMA complaint on November 16,1988, denying its allegations. On that date it also filed a motion to dismissthe complaint on the grounds that the Commission has no jurisdiction overthe administration of the Private Express Statutes. The Postal Service's motion to dismiss relies, in part, on Commission OrderNo. 133, from Docket No. RM76-4. The Commission instituted that rulemakingto provide a more appropriate context for evaluating our jurisdiction overthe Private Express Statutes than did pending classification and complaintproceedings in which that issue arose. Order No. 133 states our generalpolicy not to assert jurisdiction over questions concerning the applicationof the Private Express Statutes unless such jurisdiction is ancillary toour express statutory duties. Responses to the Postal Service's motion to dismiss the TCMA complaintwill be due on or before December 5, 1988. Parties who have not previouslyfiled a notice of intervention in this docket that satisfied Rule 20 ofour Rules of Practice (39 CFR 3001.20) must do so on or before December5, 1988, if they wish to respond to the Postal Service's motion. It is Ordered 1. Responses to the Motion to Dismiss, filed by the Postal Service in thisdocket on November 16, 1988, are due on or before December 5, 1988. 2. Parties who wish to respond to the Postal Service's Motion to Dismiss,who have not previously filed a notice of intervention in this docket,must do so on or before December 5, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Cyril J.
