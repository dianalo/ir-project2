Mr. Bush labeled the draw-down, the first use of thereserve in a time of crisis, as a &quot;test.&quot; A recently enactedlaw gave the president the right to conduct afive-million-barrel test without declaring that a disruptionin supply is imminent.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We want to make it clear to those speculators that wehave oil available to put on the market,&quot; said White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   Officials said the administration also intends to consultwith Japan and Germany, starting at a meeting of theInternational Energy Agency in Paris tomorrow, about apossible long-term, coordinated use of strategic reserves.Last week, the Energy Department, at a meeting of theadministration's top national-security aides, gave thepresident a plan to sell 500,000 barrels of oil daily fromthe reserve, which would be put on the world market incombination with a total of another 500,000 barrels dailydrawn from the German and Japanese reserves.   It isn't clear whether Japan and Germany will agree tosuch a plan. They have been more reluctant than U.S.officials to dip into strategic reserves.   Until the past few days, Mr. Bush opposed tapping thereserve during the crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,arguing that there isn't a genuine shortage of oil. Butofficials said his view changed as prices shot skyward inrecent days.   Mr. Bush's view evolved &quot;as prices keep going up withoutany physical change in the physical characteristics of themarket,&quot; said a senior administration official. &quot;It seems tobe caught up in a certain speculative fever.&quot;   Any steps to keep oil prices down would ease theadministration's worries about U.S. economic conditions andalso might serve to bolster public support for a prolongedconfrontation with Iraq by minimizing disruptions in dailylife.   The five million barrels to be drawn from the reserve andsold on the open market probably won't have an enormousimpact on oil markets. That amount represents only slightlymore than the approximately four million barrels of oilKuwait and Iraq exported each day before the crisis. Butadministration aides hope the draw-down will send a signal tooil traders that the U.S. won't let prices rise out ofcontrol.   If the U.S., Japan and Germany jointly decide to put amillion extra barrels of oil on the market daily, that amountwould ease the tighter supply situation created by the Iraqcrisis.   By authorizing extraction of oil now, Mr. Bush isapproving the first use of the reserve in an internationalcrisis. Some oil was extracted and sold in a 1985 test.   Many members of Congress have urged using the reserve andhave complained about price &quot;gouging&quot; by oil companies duringthe tensions with Iraq. Thus, it seems unlikely Congress willobject to use of the reserve.   The 590-million-barrel reserve was established after the1973 Arab oil embargo to give the U.S. a cushion to use in atime of an international crisis that produces a shortage. Theadministration has been locked in a debate over whether touse it in the current situation. Oil supplies at the momentseem adequate, but prices are rising because of speculationon oil markets about a potential future shortage if warerupts in the Middle East.   Oil prices have doubled since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion ofKuwait. Crude oil closed yesterday at $38.67 a barrel on theNew York Mercantile Exchange.   The Energy, Transportation, State and Defense departmentshave favored using the reserve to cool market speculation.But the Treasury and Commerce departments have been opposed-- as was Mr. Bush.   &quot;I think that when you have a real shortage of a productor you see an external event that is going to guarantee thatthere {will} be a shortage, then would be the time when youmost certainly should use the {reserve},&quot; Mr. Bush toldreporters at the White House 10 days ago. &quot;It is my judgmentthat there isn't such a shortage at this time.&quot;   Indeed, it still isn't clear that there is a shortage.Just yesterday, Kuwait's minister of oil and finance, SheikAli Khalifa alSabah, asserted that the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries and other nations already havemade up for the shortfall caused by the ban on purchases ofoil from Iraq and Kuwait.   &quot;It has all been replaced, 3.5 million barrels a day,&quot;said the minister, whose government was ousted by the Iraqiinvasion. He added: &quot;What's driving up the market isn'tphysical shortage, it's psychology.&quot;   Others question whether the shortage has been eliminated,and administration officials have come increasingly tobelieve that the recent surge in prices has been causedmostly by market speculators rather than the current supplysituation.   On other matters, Sheik Ali Khalifa said Iraq has done&quot;extensive damage&quot; to Kuwait's infrastructure and has killedmany Kuwaitis, although he declined to give numbers. TheIraqis took about $300 million to $350 million in gold fromKuwait's central bank, he said.   The minister also said that the roughly $5 billion hisgovernment-in-exile will give to the campaign against Iraqwill be divided about equally between military andnonmilitary aid. He also said Kuwait and Saudi Arabia won'taid Jordan until it changes its policy of maintaining ties toIraq. &quot;Turkey and Egypt definitely, but Jordan will have tochange its policy as far as I am concerned,&quot; he said.   ---   Peter Truell contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
