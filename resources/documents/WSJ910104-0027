Commodity prices are at their lowest level in nearly fouryears and appear to be headed lower in coming months as aworld-wide economic slowdown chills demand for raw materials.Even the threat of war in the Mideast, and the likely priceincreases in oil and gold that would result if it occurs,wouldn't be enough to offset the deflationary trend pushingcommodity prices generally lower, economists predict.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The U.S. economy is in a free fall that will continue atleast through the winter,&quot; says Donald Straszheim, chiefeconomist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in New York. Most otherindustrial nations are on the verge of recession orexperiencing a sharp decline in economic growth, he adds.   As a result, &quot;another 10% drop in commodity priceswouldn't be out of the question,&quot; he says.   On Wednesday, the Commodity Research Bureau index ofcommodity prices fell 1.8% to its lowest level since April1987. Yesterday, the CRB index tracking the price of 21commodities sagged 0.43 to 218.03.   Falling commodity prices indicate reduced inflationarypressure in the months ahead. That, in turn, would give theFederal Reserve more leeway to combat the recession bylowering short-term interest rates further.   Just five months ago, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent crudeoil futures soaring to more than $40 a barrel and sparkedfears of an inflationary price spiral. Gold prices also shothigher.   But a world-wide oil glut, caused in part by increasedproduction from Saudi Arabia as well as by flat to fallingconsumption by many Western nations, reversed the trend inoil prices within weeks of the August invasion of Kuwait.Yesterday crude oil futures for February delivery slid $1.01a barrel to $25.48 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   If war is begun in the Mideast, oil prices most likelywould spike upward. But they would only remain at high levelsin the event that Iraq was able to cripple Saudi Arabia's oilproduction and distribution facilities, economists speculate.   Unless that happens, crude oil will fall back to the$20-to-$22 a barrel range within a few months, and maytemporarily dip into the mid-teens, predicts Samuel Kahan,chief economist for Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago.   With most Western economies running out of steam, a broadfuel price index tracked by Georgia State University'seconomic forecasting center that includes crude oil isexpected to plunge 20% by year end, says Stacy Kottman, aGeorgia State economist.   old has also pulled well back from its post-invasion highof about $420 an ounce. This year gold is likely to tradewithin 1990's price range of roughly $350 to $425 an ounce,says Frederick Demler, a metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc.in New York.   Heavy gold selling by the cash-strapped Soviet Union hasweighed on gold prices in recent months, and would mostlikely do so again if a Mideast war pushed prices higher.Gold also lost some of its luster as a safe haven investmentfor oil-rich Arab investors last year when many Kuwaitisdiscovered they couldn't pull their bullion out of thenation, Mr. Demler adds.   Among nonprecious metals, copper prices are likely to fallduring the first half of the year as the result of saggingworld demand, Mr. Demler says. An exception is Germany, wherethe need for new housing in what was East Germany has keptcopper demand strong.   Weighing on copper prices later this year will be theincrease in world production from the huge La Escondidacopper mine in Chile that just went &quot;on stream&quot; last month,he adds.   A sustained war in the Mideast and higher oil prices coulddepress world metals prices. Higher oil costs would reducemanufacturing output, and therefore the demand for metals,says Raymond Worseck, chief economist with A.G. Edwards andamp;Sons in St. Louis.   Grain and soybean prices are weighed down by near bumpercrops in the U.S., Canada, Europe and the Soviet Union.However, massive distribution problems in the Soviet Unionhave resulted in millions of bushels of grain rotting in thefields. Export demand has also been sluggish for the pastseveral months, and shows no signs of rebounding any timesoon, futures analysts say.   If the U.S. pulls out of the current recession sometimeafter mid-year, as many economists predict, the recovery islikely to be slow and won't put much inflationary pressure oncommodity prices.   &quot;The economy is going to come out of the recession with awhimper, not a bang,&quot; says Mr. Kahan of Fuji Securities.   In commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Futures prices of petroleum were off sharply againon further news of pending talks between Iraq and the U.S.over the Mideast crisis. After President Bush proposed ameeting in Switzerland next week between Secretary of StateJames Baker and Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister, U.S. oilprices fell below $25 a barrel to a level not seen sinceearly August just after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Aftersome recovery from the day's low, crude oil for Februarydelivery settled at $25.48 a barrel, down $1.01, on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange. In London, the February Brent crudecontract ended trading on the International PetroleumExchange $1.55 a barrel lower at $24.89. Dragged down bycrude, fuel prices continued to fall. In U.S. futures,February heating oil has lost nearly nine cents a gallon injust two days of trading. Although petroleum demand hasturned sluggish, oil analysts said the sharp price declinesin the past two days are due mostly to expectations thatdiplomatic efforts may yet avert a war in the Mideast.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures regained some of theground lost Wednesday as March soybean futures closed threecents a bushel higher at $5.7025 a bushel on the ChicagoBoard of Trade. Analysts said the modest price rise waspartly due to reports that one of Brazil's prime soybeangrowing regions was suffering from below-average moisture.Strong European demand for soybean meal also supported U.S.soybean futures prices, analysts said. March corn futuresclosed a half cent a bushel higher at $2.3225 a bushel, whileMarch wheat futures on the Board of Trade slid four cents abushel to close at $2.5950 a bushel.                                                                                                          COPPER: Prices fell yesterday and the March contractfinished down three cents a pound at $1.1630. &quot;The recentrally was vastly exaggerated by technical factors,&quot; saidWilliam O'Neill, commodity analyst at Merrill Lynch Futuresin New York. He said the run-up was touched off Friday by awork stoppage at a large copper mine in Chile atChuquicamata. It now appears that the grievances at that minehave been settled, at least temporarily. Mr. O'Neill notedthat there appears to be little excess metal in Asia,particularly in Japan. But, he added, &quot;these two factorsdon't appear to be constructive enough to dictate a rally ofthe magnitude we have witnessed since last week.&quot; He pointedout that the buying being done by commodity funds appeared tobe mostly short-covering -- that is, buying back contractsthat had been sold earlier with the expectation of decliningprices. He also noted that the current economic situationdoesn't justify higher copper prices. However, BernardSavaiko, senior analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said one cannotjudge the demand for copper solely by the direction of theU.S. economy, because &quot;about 80% of the demand for coppercomes from outside the U.S.&quot; He added that he was notsurprised by yesterday's sell-off given the 10-cent run-upover the past week. He said he believed the market wouldoffer some resistance to further price declines at around the$1.14 level and would encounter strong price resistance above$1.22.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Prices were mixed, with silver andplatinum finishing higher and gold slipping. Silver turned ina surprisingly robust performance with the March contractending 10 cents an ounce higher at $4.267. April platinumfinished at $415.90 an ounce, up $2.40. February gold lost$2.20 an ounce to $388.90. Mr. Savaiko of PaineWebber said hebelieved that silver was attempting to catch up to gold. Henoted that in the past few months the ratio of gold prices tosilver prices had moved from about 70 to more than 94. Healso said precious metals will be buoyed by lower interestrates, which will reduce the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of holding anasset that doesn't produce income, such as gold or silver. Headded, &quot;I also don't believe that the bears on the metalswill press their case very strongly ahead of the UnitedNations' deadline for Iraq to vacate Kuwait of Jan. 15.&quot; Henoted that South Africa, a major producer of gold andplatinum, has suspended forward sales of its precious metalsat least until Jan. 15. Mr. O'Neill of Merrill Lynch said hethinks silver and platinum continue to be viewed more asindustrial metals and therefore are less affected by eventsin the Mideast. Consequently, when rumors about settlementtalks begin to swirl as they did yesterday, prices of thosetwo metals are not buffeted as gold's price is. Both Mr.Savaiko and Mr. O'Neill said that they expected silver toretest its recent high set a few weeks ago of $4.40 an ounce.Mr. O'Neill said he doesn't see any significant physicaldemand for silver at this time. &quot;Silver's rally to above the$4.25 area was due to short-covering and technical buying. Isaw little {commodity} fund buying in this rally,&quot; he added.Mr. O'Neill noted that if the Mideast crisis is settledwithout shooting, demand for platinum could be boosted aslower gasoline prices stimulate increased use of autos.However, he noted that there is currently a surplus ofplatinum.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: March futures ended the day three cents apound lower at $1.0815. The soonest-to-expire Januarycontract ended at $1.0615, up 0.80 cent, after trading as lowas $1.0350. It had declined by more than eight cents the daybefore. Mr. Savaiko of PaineWebber said that even if Floridawere to be hit by a major freeze, there is still too muchjuice around. He noted that orange juice, like mostcommodities, is now in a deflationary environment andtherefore the market is in the process of wringing anyinflationary expectations out of its price.   ---                     Collapsing Commodities                                                                                                                              Cash market prices                                                                                                                                             SEPT. 28       JAN. 3                                        1990          1991                                                                                                        Crude Oil                             $39.50        $25.50   (West Texas Intermediate,   dollars per barrel)                                                                                                        Gold                                  409.74        387.61   dollars per troy ounce)                                                                                                        Aluminum                                0.92          0.71   (ingot, dollars per pound)                                                                                                        Soybeans                                5.98          5.56   (dollars per bushel)                                                                                                        Orange Juice                            1.37          1.06   (frozen concentrate,   nearest futures, dollars   per pound)</TEXT></DOC>
