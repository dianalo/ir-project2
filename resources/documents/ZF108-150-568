said Ledbetter, engineering section head ofProcter andamp; Gamble Co. of Cincinnati.andP;  &quot;We also needed to have an improvementin speed.&quot;andM;Mail 2.0 provided both enhancements, at least in part, because Ledbetteraggressively voiced his views on what he needed in a final product.andM;&quot;In Mail 2.0, there were some specific improvements we needed in our businessenvironment,&quot; Ledbetter said.andP;  &quot;By being a beta site, we were able todemonstrate that this improved product would meet that need as well asinfluence Microsoft in what was really important to us.&quot;andM;Worth the fuss.andP;  Professionals agree to become beta testers largely becausethey expect future products will include features and functions critical toachieving their business goals.andM;&quot;We beta test a lot of things, mainly because we want to stay in theforefront of technology and have the opportunity to change things before theyhit the streets,&quot; said C.L.andP;  Jeff Jeffers, network services director forBoston College in Chestnut Hill, Mass.andP;  &quot;What we're really looking for whenwe beta test a product is to tell [vendors] what's right and what's wrongwith their products and to get our agenda into the product cycle.&quot;andM;As a beta tester, Jeffers virtually ensures that his department will meet itsthree-year strategic goals.andP;  &quot;If we're in at the beginning of a product'slife cycle, we can guarantee [our plan] will come true,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;As a betasite, we can influence the direction of the equipment and the manufacturer.&quot;andM;Time-intensive.andP;  While the beta process does afford participatingorganizations many advantages, there are drawbacks, the major one being thetime involved.andM;&quot;There are only so many hours in a day,&quot; said Pat Thompson, vice president ofthe Apple Professional Exchange (APX).andP;  &quot;In testing A.M.E.andP;  (Access ManagedEnvironment, a security program from Casady andamp; Greene), we spent about 20 to30 hours in testing.andP;  Some I did at home, before and after hours.andP;  It'simpossible during the day.&quot;andM;Some products require less testing time than others, said Mike Bailey,president of APX and a systems integrator for Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.andO;of Sunnyvale, Calif.andM;&quot;We've beta tested some for 15 minutes and gotten enough feedback to correctmost of the problems,&quot; Bailey said.andP;  &quot;A network product is more intensive,and you're looking at a minimum of 30 hours total testing time.&quot;andM;Those hours are likely to be spread over weeks, because testers might useproducts for an hour a day or three to four hours a week.andP;  That's one reason,Bailey noted, that organizations should not test too many products.andM;Many organizations build beta testing into their computer administrators' jobdescriptions.andM;&quot;It's factored into my daily work,&quot; Jeffers said.andP;  &quot;Once the legal papers aresigned, the vendor usually installs it.andP;  We have to read documentation andunderstand how to use the product, and someone has to go out there and makesure it's used daily.&quot;andM;Writing up problem reports and placing long-distance calls to developersrequire a commitment of time and energy that Boston College is willing tomake to assure its products work, Jeffers added.andM;Crashes and burns.andP;  Another potential pitfall of the beta-testing process isthe risk an organization takes each time it puts something new and unknown ona network, especially within a multiplatform environment.andM;That's why Infotron Systems Corp. operates betas on test networks -- productscan run full tilt without disrupting users, said Cris Maloney, head of theMicrocomputer Technology Group for the Cherry Hill, N.J.-based networkingsupplier.andM;MIS managers also must spell out to users in the beta process that theproducts they're testing are indeed test products.andM;&quot;You have to state clearly that it's a beta,&quot; said Chris Gladwin, productevaluation specialist with Martin Marietta Corp.'s computing standardsorganization in Chantilly, Va.andP;  &quot;If you put a beta into users' hands and itcrashes, they may not understand what beta means.&quot;andM;Knowing when to join.andP;  Products go through different test phases before beingreleased for sale to the general public.andP;  Most organizations prefer to dobeta testing rather than alpha testing.andP;  The first phase, which developersoften do internally, can involve system crashes and other unpleasantries,Jeffers said.andM;&quot;You can get bloodied in the alpha world because not all the software isthere, not all the hardware is guaranteed to work, and you can bring a wholenetwork down,&quot; Jeffers said.andM;Martin Marietta will enter on the ground floor for significant new productslike Novell Inc.'s NetWare 2.15.andP;  &quot;To us, that was more than an upgrade; itwas a whole new level of functionality,&quot; Gladwin said.andM;&quot;We wanted to be involved at the pre-alpha stage to be able to have input towhat the product did.andM;&quot;If it's a maintenance upgrade, which means fixing bugs, and there are noreal design issues, the beta stage is fine,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But if it's asignificant new release and it's strategically important to us, we might wantto be involved earlier than beta and have more influence.&quot; n</TEXT></DOC>
