In a report issued Monday, the Lawyers' Committee for CivilRights Under Law said the administration subverted the law's intentby interpreting sections of the statute as allowing infusions ofmoney to South Africa.   The report also said the administration ignored Congress'direction to enlist allies in imposing a broad trade blockadeagainst South Africa.   The report was released as the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee prepared to open hearings Wednesday on new and strongersanctions legislation. A similar bill is expected to come to a votein the full House soon.   Both bills would place a virtual ban on U.S. trade andinvestment in South Africa within a year. Backers say the UnitedStates needs to escalate economic pressure on Pretoria to forceabandonment of its system of official racism.   The legislation is given a good chance of passing in the Housebut is likely to have a tougher time in the Senate, where it lacksthe support of moderate Republicans who gave the current sanctionslaw crucial backing two years ago. The administration opposes thebill.   The 1986 sanctions, enacted over President Reagan's veto, bannedimportation of South African textiles, agricultural products, ironand steel and coal and uranium. They also prohibited new U.S.investment and new loans to the South African government.   The lawyers' report said the administration has allowed ``largequantities'' of South African uranium to continue to be importedinto the United States in spite of the ban; allowed Ford Motor Co.to pour $61 million into a South African company that was takingover the automaker's operations there; and interpreted a ban onexports of petroleum products to allow re-export from thirdcountries.   Concerns that the sanctions would not be fully implemented by anadministration hostile to their intent have ``in part'' beenrealized, the report found.   ``Most troubling has been the administration's refusal to seek acoordinated strategy with other industrialized countries'' toimpose multilateral sanctions, the lawyers' group concluded.   ``This failure may have created the greatest limitation on thepotential impact of the sanctions,'' the report stated.   ``Not only has the administration failed to comply with thespirit of the law, it has actively worked to subvert and underminethe efforts of other nations to achieve precisely the kind ofmultilateral cooperation contemplated by the statute.''   Gay J. McDougal, director of the study, acknowledged thatCongress' instructions on encouraging multilateral participationwere merely advisory and not legally binding, and that somecongressional supporters sought to pass a bill that would be more asymbolic statement against apartheid than a real economic weapon.   To remedy that shortcoming, the group recommended newlegislation to close many of the loopholes. It also recommended aseries of new sanctions that closely resemble the pendinglegislation sponsored by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and Sen.Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
