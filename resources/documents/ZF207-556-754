IBM ran the testsunder the RAMP-C benchmark.andP;  The test results show the IBM AS/400B20 performed at 13,000 RAMP-C transactions per hour (tph), whichis faster than the 8,800 tph DEC Microvax 3600s.andP;  Test resultsalso show the 35,300 tph IBM AS/400 B60 as faster than IBM's own9380 models 30, 80 and 90; the DEC VAC 6220; and HP's 3000 Series950 minicomputer.andP;  Analysts split over the validity and meaning ofthe IBM results.andP;  The search continues for an acceptablepublic-domain benchmark for measuring the performance of mid-rangesystems.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   International Business Machines Corp.
