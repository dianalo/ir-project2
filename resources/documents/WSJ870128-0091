MD-11.    Senior U.S. officials are scheduled to visit European capitals next week to ask officials of sponsoring governments not to provide financing for production and marketing of the MD-11's Airbus competitors, the wide-bodied A-340 and A-330.    They also are expected for the first time to raise the possibility that U.S. aircraft makers may file anti-dumping or countervailing duty petitions against Airbus products if the government-owned aircraft consortium continues to market its wide-body planes aggressively. Airbus is an international consortium financed jointly by Britain, France and West Germany.    The new U.S. effort follows accusations by Washington that the Europeans are reneging on an agreement reached last summer. Under the agreement, they pledged to stop using government political pressure or special inducements, such as the offer of landing rights in their countries, to potential buyers of the A-340 and A-330 series.    The Reagan administration believes the market for such medium-sized, long-range, wide-bodied aircraft is so narrow that there is no room for the U.S. and Airbus products both to succeed.    U.S. officials contend that the subsidies Airbus receives are so large that they violate the international aircraft code of the Geneva, Switzerland-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Under that code, government-financed aircraft-manufacturing projects must be profitable over the life of the production effort and provide a reasonable rate of return to investors. Washington has been considering filing a formal complaint in GATT.    In addition to the possibility of filing anti-dumping or countervailing-duty cases, the U.S. also has threatened to begin unfair-trade-practices proceedings against Airbus.    The existence of Airbus has been an irritant in U.S.-European trade relations for several years. The Europeans have viewed the three-country consortium as a point of national pride.    The Europeans contend the U.S. aircraft-manufacturing industry also is government-subsidized because it benefits from military contracts that finance technological development that can be used in production of civilian aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
