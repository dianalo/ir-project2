CrimeWave.andP;  This latest thriller from Access Software has a plot like an adventuregame and all the shoot 'em up action of an arcade classic.andP;  If that's notenough to get you to pull the box off the shelf, consider that Crime Waveuses stunning VGA graphics of nearly photographic quality and, of course,Access's sound system (RealSound), which makes an ordinary PC sound like ithas a $200 music card.andM;As the story unfolds-or rather flashes by in animated cells--Mr.andP;  King Pin,boss of a nationwide crime cartel, kidnaps the President's daughter and haulsher off to a secret warehouse.andP;  it is your job to rescue her and in theprocess rid our cities of the drugs and thugs that Mr. Pin controls.andO;Sandwiched between storyboards describing the plot are intense episodes ofarcade action, where you'll battle the likes of Eddie The Lump, the EvilNinja, and K909.andM;You are not defenseless.andP;  Armed with weapons, including a five-shots-at-oncemachine gun and an awesome rocket launcher, and protected by a powerfulshield, you make your way deeper and deeper into the infested town.andP;  Ammo,your shield, and lives are all renewable resources.andP;  The first two can bescooped up as they drop from the top of the screen (heaven?), and the latterare stashed in various places around the city.andM;The arcade action ranges over a variety of different settings.andP;  The playbegins in a railroad yard (watch out for snipers in the coaches), and moveson through a ghetto, a weapons plant, a drug factory, a subway station, andfinally ends up in King Pin's mansion.andP;  Along the way, doors lead into darkand dangerous bonus rooms where laser beams and kinetic death pads presentpuzzles and obstacles you must overcome if you are to complete the rescue.andO;Don't skip the bonus rooms, since they contain some useful supplies.andM;In addition to the 3,000 points you get for surviving each bonus room, otherpoints are awarded for blowing away various villains like Eddie T. Lump, whocounts for a measly 500, and The King Pin himself, who goes for a cool25,000.andM;Crime Wave keeps score, allowing you to save your name and points aftersuccessfully completing the game.andP;  Crime Wave will not, however, allow you tosave anything else, such as a game in progress, which means you'll have tocomplete your rescue in one sitting.andP;  That's just one of severalinconveniences I found in an otherwise excellent product.andP;  The others: itdoesn't support joysticks, it requires a hard disk, and it can beridiculously slow on a slow computer (although you can choose to play asubset of Crime Wave that includes just the arcade action).andM;Once you master the beginners level of play, you progress to twomore-difficult levels.andP;  At the novice level, you may be attacked by onlythree or four gangsters at once.andP;  Ammo floats down at a slow rate, and youcan take many hits before you expire.andP;  At the most difficult level, you mustfight off waves of attackers.andP;  Supplies seem to be hurled at you too rapidlyto scoop up, and one or two hits can do you in.andM;From the first notes of Crime Wave's opening music  (you'll swear it's PinkFloyd, but it isn't) to the last animated scene on a tropical island, you'llbe astonished at how far computer games have come since the early hit, Pong.andO;With its breathtaking graphics and surprisingly good sound-which requires noadditional hardware--Crime Wave is a worthy addition to Access's series ofstate-of-the-art games.andP;  If you have a hard disk drive and a VGA or EGA card,this is a game you'll want to own.andP;  List Price: Crime Wave, $59.95.andO;Requires: 640K RAM, EGA or VGA graphics adapter, color monitor, hard disk,DOS 2.0 or later.andP;  Access Software, 545 W. 500 S., Bountiful, UT 84010; (800)824-2549.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
