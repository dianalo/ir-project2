PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A record number of manatees, 160,died in Florida waters in 1989, and state biologists fear recentcold weather will kill more of the lumbering marine mammals.   ``We're quite worried about the increasing number of deaths,''said Bruce Ackerman, a researcher with the Department of NaturalResources in St. Petersburg.   Biologists estimate at least 1,200 manatees, an endangeredspecies, live in Florida. The population had been estimated at asmany as 10,000 a few decades ago.   In 1989, 51 manatees died after hitting boats or barges, andfive were killed by other human-caused problems, such asentanglement in fishing nets, according to the Department ofNatural Resources.   In 1988, 133 manatees were found dead in Florida. Boats killed43 manatees, then a record.   Environmentalists and government biologists cite thesestatistics when they promote boating speed limits and increasedprotection of manatee habitat, issues state lawmakers could debatethis spring.   Manatees frequent rivers, estuaries, canals and protectedcoastal areas that also are magnets for the state's more than710,000 registered motor boats.   The average adult manatee is about 10 feet long and weighs 1,000pounds, though some weigh three times that much. Gray andslow-moving, they can be difficult for speedy boaters to spot, saidLori Price, captive marine mammal specialist for the Department ofNatural Resources.   ``I think very few of them (boaters) actually maliciously intendto run down a manatee,'' she said. ``They're very difficult tosee.''</TEXT></DOC>
