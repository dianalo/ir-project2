Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged parliamentary deputies to ``vote oncompetence alone'' rather than ``differences of taste, or Godforbid, personal matters.''   His appeal for a speedy vote of confidence in Rafsanjani'sCabinet at a parliamentary session scheduled Sunday indicatesopposition to Rafsanjani's policies and the 22 ministers he haschosen to carry them out.   In a speech broadcast by Tehran Radio, which was monitored inNicosia, Khamenei stressed Iran cannot afford to have Rafsanjani'sgovernment undercut by no-confidence votes against ministers.   ``Frankly, in these times, every single day is crucial. If one ofthese ministries is left without someone in charge, even for a dayor a week, a big part of the people's affairs will be left undone,''Khamenei said.   Rafsanjani, the 54-year-old former parliament speaker, emerged asIran's new leader after the June 3 death of revolutionary leaderAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   In a landslide election victory July 28, he won the presidencyand unprecedented executive powers in constitutional reformsdesigned to streamline Iran's decision making.   Rafsanjani favos ending Iran's isolation and attracting Westerninvestment to rebuild Iran after its eight-year war with Iraq.   He is bitterly opposed by hard-liners led by outgoing InteriorMinister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who think his policies deviate fromKhomeini's course.   Rafsanjani dumped Mohtashemi and other hard-liners in hisproposed Cabinet in favor of technocrats, though more than half ofparliament called on him to keep Mohtashemi.   In an apparent attempt to pacify his critics, Rafsanjani toldIranian diplomats gathered in Tehran Wednesday that his policies donot deviate from Khomeini's strategy.   He also denied there is a power struggle.   ``What exists in our country ... is the presence of differenttastes and currents of thought, and not a power struggle,'' TehranRadio quoted him as saying.   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored inCyprus, quoted Mohtashemi as saying Wednesday: ``Any new plan andprinciple contrary to (Khomeini's) principles is a blatant violationof his clear path.''</TEXT></DOC>
