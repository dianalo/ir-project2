Dependent on the insolation are all other regenerativeenergies, beginning with wind power, via environmental heat to the photosynthesisof plants. The state-of-the-art of solar collectors, heat pumps and absorbers,wind power converters, facilities for bio mass utilization, and in particularsolar cells for direct conversion of light into electricity will be demonstrated.Efficiencies between 6 and 10% are expected at the latter, whereat valuesof more than 25% are possible with the so-called tandem solar cells untilthe next century. The electricity generating cost are estimated in dependenceon the manufacturing capacity of solar cells. From the presently approx.5 DM/kWh, a decreasing trend up to 0.25 DM/kWh can be deviated. The developmentof the fuel prices will have an important influence on the future utilizationof regenerative energy sources. A proportionate share of maximum 4 to8% in the final energy demand through solar energy is expected for theFederal Republic of Germany until the turn of the century mainly in theform of hydro power, environmental heat and bio mass. Photovoltaic willpresumably not even achieve 0.1% in 13 years. Nuclear energy alreadyhas a proportionate share of 6% in the final energy demand today. Finally,the crucial points of the planned RWE Photovoltaic Research Programmewill be discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
