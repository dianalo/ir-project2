The high court's action, refusing to hear an appeal by Rep. Don Sundquist (R., Tenn.), came as a surprise to members of the House who approved a resolution in May, 413-0, urging Supreme Court review.    Steven Ross, general counsel to the House, said the appeals court's ruling has &quot;raised questions about whether the flow of information to constituents and to the public will be curtailed.&quot;    Rep. Sundquist was sued by a lawyer with Memphis Area Legal Services over a letter the congressman wrote in 1985 to then Attorney General William French Smith. In the letter, Rep. Sundquist criticized the activities of the lawyer, Wayne Chastain, in raising legal obstacles to local efforts to collect child-support payments from recalcitrant parents.    The Constitution shields legislative activities of members of Congress from lawsuits, and a federal judge here dismissed Mr. Chastain's libel suit.    But last November, an appeals court here ruled 2-1 that although Rep. Sundquist's letter was an official action, it wasn't part of his legislative role and, therefore, was outside the immunity the Constitution provides legislators. The appeals court ordered a trial, and Rep. Sundquist appealed to the high court.    Justices Byron White, Harry Blackmun and Sandra O'Connor voted to hear the case, one vote short of the four needed.    The appeals court's ruling is already having an impact. House Counsel Ross says a libel suit has been filed in Houston against Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas) over his statement that a fund-raiser on contract to a Texas state agency wasn't entitled to a commission on federal funds intended to restore the battleship Texas.    And not long ago, Mr. Ross said, Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) ordered the text of a controversial committee report printed in the Congressional Record, rather than publicly distributed. Material in the Congressional Record is covered by legislative immunity, Mr. Ross noted, but public issuance of the report isn't immune under the appeals court's ruling.    Agent Orange   The justices decided not to hear two appeals by Vietnam veterans who want to sue manufacturers of the herbicide Agent Orange on their own rather than be bound by the settlement of a class-action suit over the same issue. The high court's action is expected to clear the way for distribution of a settlement fund, now valued at about $230 million, created by major chemical companies.    James Sparrow, director of Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims, said the first funds would probably go to families of veterans who died from exposure to the chemical, and to veterans who are totally disabled.    Other Cases   In other actions yesterday, the high court:   --Allowed Wyoming to sue directly in the Supreme Court over an Oklahoma law that requires coal-burning power plants located in and serving Oklahoma to buy at least 10% of their coal from mines in the state. Wyoming says this interferes with interstate commerce.    --Refused to hear a challenge by the cable television industry to a formula used by the U.S. Copyright Office to calculate royalties cable operators must pay for carrying over-the-air television broadcasts on cable. The cable industry says the formula is a $40 million-a-year windfall to television producers.    --Agreed to decide whether a state may prohibit &quot;testimonial advertising&quot; by lawyers. The court will review a California rule that bars such ads, in which, typically, former clients praise the efforts of a lawyer and recommend that he be hired.    --Said it will decide whether statistics showing a concentration of minority workers in one kind of job may be used to prove that hiring practices had a discriminatory effect in other job categories. The case involves alleged racial bias at salmon canneries in Alaska operated by Wards Cove Packing Co. and Castle andamp; Cooke Inc. The issue is similar to one that split the court on Wednesday.    --Let stand a federal judge's damage award of $840,556 against Grumman Corp. for the father of a Navy pilot who was killed in 1979 when his A-6 attack plane crashed in the Pacific. On Monday, the high court ruled that defense contractors are shielded from such lawsuits in some circumstances, but the court declined yesterday to apply that shield to Grumman.    --Agreed to decide whether the Constitution bars the death penalty for offenders who were younger than 18 when they committed their crimes. The court was split on the question in a ruling issued on Wednesday. </TEXT></DOC>
