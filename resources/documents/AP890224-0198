In New York, Israeli U.N. Ambassador Johanan Bein ``expressedregret for the unnecessary death,'' said Israel was investigatingand stressed that the shooting involved only the SLA and not Israelitroops, Barukh Binah, the Israeli U.N. Mission spokesman, told TheAssociated Press.   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,said Pvt. Michael McNeela, 21, was shot in the chest by machine-gunfire from an SLA position overlooking an Irish post in the southernLebanese village of Hadatta.   ``Death was instantaneous,'' said Goksel. ``The fire was notprovoked.''   In Dublin, Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan called in the Israelicharge d'affaires and strongly protested what he called the``unprovoked killing.''   ``Mr. Lenihan insisted the incident could not but have a negativeeffect on relations with Israel,'' said a spokesman for the ForeignAffairs Department, speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``The Israeli representative expressed regret and undertook toconvey the views of the Irish government to the Israeliauthorities,'' the spokesman said. The Israeli diplomat was notidentified by name.   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said at U.N. Headquarters In NewYork that Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding, in charge ofpeacekeeping, summoned Bein ``and protested strongly this incident.''   Goulding, in a verbal protest, repeated the U.N. position ``thatIsrael is responsible for the South Lebanon Army, and we do notaccept the view that the SLA is acting independently.''   It was a rarely publicized U.N. diplomatic complaint. The UnitedNations seldom makes timely announcements of its protests.   Diplomatic sources at the United Nations, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said the incident appeared to be a mistake and thatthe SLA militiaman apparently fired without authorization of his ownsuperior officer.   But a statement read by Giuliani said, ``The recent upsurge ofSLA's deliberate and unprovoked firing to UNIFIL positions, mostlyto Irish, has been persistently protested with the Israeli army, butnothing had come out of these protests.''   McNeela was on his second tour of duty in Lebanon with the700-man Irish battalion in the 5,800-member UNIFIL force. He hadplanned to marry soon.   Lars-Eric Wahlgren, commander of the U.N. force, visited thevillage later and told reporters: ``I condemn the senseless killingof one of my soldiers.''   Most SLA members are Christians. Israel trains and finances themilitia, which helps 1,000 Israeli troops patrol the Jewish state'sself-designated ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.   Israel established the eight-to-10 mile zone in 1985 afterwithdrawing most of its troops from Lebanon.   Since the U.N. force was deployed in southern Lebanon in 1978under a U.N. peacekeeping mandate, 160 peacekeepers have been killed_ 27 of them Irishmen.</TEXT></DOC>
