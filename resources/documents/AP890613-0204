Their mission is to remove asbestos insulation from a leakingsteam pipe as required by a federal law that is forcing every schoolin the nation to take costly and drastic steps to control a mineralonce used widely as a fire retardant. It is now linked to lungcancer and other diseases.   ``I've seen people die of asbestosis,'' said Jim Breslin,abatement supervisor for the Philadelphia School District and aformer pipe insulator at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. ``I'm notinterested in catching it.''   It's a fight some say could have been avoided if asbestoscompanies had heeded and divulged early warnings of health risks.Instead, the substance was used in insulation, ceilings, floors andwalls for decades.   The Philadelphia School District will have to spend $425.6million to remove asbestos from more than 400 buildings, including291 used by children, in addition to more than $50 million alreadyspent on asbestos abatement in the nation's sixth-largest schooldistrict.   Every school had to submit an asbestos management plan by May 9or face fines up to $5,000 a day under the Asbestos Hazard EmergencyResponse Act of 1986. Some 21 percent of U.S. school systems hadviolated the law by not filing plans before the original Oct. 12deadline or obtaining a deferral to May 9.   Pennsylvania schools were fifth-worst with 41.3 percent failingto comply. Indiana had 41.5 percent not in compliance; Maine, 41.9percent; Virginia, 43.9 percent; and Mississippi, 46.2 percent.Compliance generally has been higher for public than privateschools, said Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman AliciaTenuta in Washington.   An estimated 44,600 of the nation's 107,000 school buildingscontain asbestos that could become dangerous.   Asbestos fibers can cause asbestosis, a scarring of lung tissuethat diminishes breathing capacity; mesothelioma, a cancer of thelining of the chest or abdominal cavity; and lung cancer, often longafter exposure.   The cleanup law requires only management, not removal, of allasbestos.   ``We're talking well into the next century for some of thisremoval,'' said Bernard Rafferty, district asbestos cleanup chief.Nevertheless, the district expects to spend $75.8 million fightingasbestos during the next six years.   ``We don't question the need to address this environmentalhazard,'' said Albert I. Glassman, associate superintendent forbuildings.   ``I'm sure responsible school people all over the nation feel thesame way. But we do question the imposition of the total burden fordoing this on the backs of financially strapped school systems.''   Washington has provided little to offset cleanup costs the EPAestimates at $3 billion nationwide. From fiscal 1985-1988, $160million had been distributed under the Asbestos School HazardAbatement Act, with $47.5 million to be distributed this year, saidEPA spokesman Lee Blackburn.   ``It's clear there's limited resources for schools and a lot ofother demands _ educational reform issues, increasing teacherssalaries, drug education,'' said Joel C. Packer, coordinator of theWashington-based Asbestos In Schools Coalition. His organization ispushing for more federal money.   The law requires states to review plans and monitor abatement.   The Department of Environmental Resources, ordered by Gov. RobertP. Casey to review the plans, was 3{ months late with its report oncompliance. It gave Pennsylvania schools a higher mark than EPA,with 36 percent noncompliance, but the DER still is developing waysto review the plans, casting uncertainty over cleanups that the lawrequires to start by July 9.   ``School districts either cannot go ahead with removal work orrun the risk of having to do work over again if it is not approvedby DER,'' said state Sen. Mike Fisher, chairman of the SenateEnvironmental Resources and Energy Committee.   ``We have acknowledged that we've had a slow start, but we'removing very aggressively now,'' DER Deputy Secretary Mark M.McClellan said. The department is adding staff and plans to hirecontractors this summer to speed the reviews.   Much of the problem is the constant change brought on by thefragility of asbestos, even after it is declared contained. ``Kidsknock up against it with their chairs, stick a pencil in it, or awater leak occurs and breaks it down,'' said Glassman.   Those cases are treated as emergencies by the 30-member full-time``A-Team'' trained in an EPA-certified program. A ``C-Team'' of 60maintenance workers has been cleared for part-time work. Both teamsuse the same procedures as workers in other schools once a problemis located.   Using plastic sheeting, the Beeber A-Team has sealed the boy'sgym office where the leaking pipe was found. Workers pass throughtwo additional chambers of plastic that serve as safety traps. Theoffice is ventilated by a filter that catches 99.97 percent of anyfibers. Each worker going in dons two suits of a non-breathablesynthetic material. A health hygienist monitors the air they breathethrough masks.   When work begins in earnest this week with the end of school, theasbestos will be sprayed with a wetting agent, cut with a razorknife, sprayed again and bagged. No more than 20 pounds per bagbecause the bag might break.   On the way out, the workers shed one suit in one chamber, thesecond in the second chamber, to ensure no fibers leave with them.By the time they are done, air samples must show less than 0.01fibers per cubic centimeter. ``At times it might seem like overkill,but you never know when you're going to have a problem,'' Breslinsaid.   Each step is recorded: the date work started, how much asbestosis removed, where it is taken, how many fibers showed up on samples.   ``Since there's such a long gestation period for these cancersand these cancerlike diseases, it's possible that 30, 40, 50 yearswould go by and then someone who gets cancer would file a personalinjury suit,'' said Patricia Donovan, attorney for the schooldistrict.   ``I don't want my successors to have to try to reconstruct whathappened in 1988, 1989 and 1990.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 18</NOTE></DOC>
