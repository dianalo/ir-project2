These days combination dinners -- or &quot;combos&quot; -- are beingpromoted as the best deal. The slew of sandwiches that letpeople eat lunch for a dollar and change last year are barelymentioned in ads. And some of the cheapest fare is beingdropped altogether.</LP><TEXT>   This new view of &quot;value&quot; is simultaneously putting more incustomer stomachs and in the chains' coffers. Combo mealsallow stores to steer customers toward items with higherprofit margins. McDonald's features Extra Value Meals. BurgerKing pushes BK Meal Deals. And Wendy's offers Biggies, a lineof large sandwiches with fries and drinks to match.   The chains are also expanding the concept of &quot;value&quot; toinclude the quality of the food, service and restaurantambiance in addition to the price. &quot;They realize that the wayyou build loyalty is by some combination of values,&quot; saysRonald Paul, a Chicago-based restaurant consultant. As forout-and-out discounting, he says, &quot;it's run its course.&quot;   None too soon, some franchisees say. At discount-leaderTaco Bell (which itself has dropped a line of 39-centsnacks), many independent store operators are rebellingagainst the PepsiCo Inc. unit's pricing strategy. Franchiseeswho own more than a third of the chain's 3,500 stores bandedtogether in January to form an independent group, in partbecause of dissatisfaction with what they regard as overlyzealous pricing.   &quot;We went too far,&quot; says Ron Bellamy, president of thefranchisee group and owner of seven Taco Bell stores in Texasand Oklahoma. He says many group members are ignoring TacoBell's guidelines and raising prices on some items normallycosting 59, 79 or 99 cents. Mr. Bellamy, for example, willincrease the price of soft tacos to 69 cents from 59 centsand add a dime to the price of four items that had cost 79cents.   Other franchisees say such moves are necessary to reviveprofits. &quot;We had to increase prices slightly to break evenwith the previous year,&quot; says Fred Kotoske, a Taco Bellfranchisee in Columbia, S.C., citing higher labor, insuranceand produce costs. Customers don't seem to mind the priceincreases, he says, and traffic counts at his 10 storesdidn't drop.   Taco Bell officials say they're sticking with thelow-price strategy that ignited the industry's price war. Butwhile the chain rang up big sales gains, in recent months itsprofit growth has slowed sharply. Operating earningsincreases of 108% and 19% in the first two quarters last yearshrank to 2% in the third quarter and 5% in the fourth.   And current Taco Bell ads feature a $1.99 steak burritothat is among the priciest items on the Mexican chain's menu.Franchisees like Mr. Kotoske say they're pleased that &quot;theemphasis is on re-establishing to the consumer that we haveitems that are large, filling -- and value-priced.&quot;   Featuring combo meals allows chains' counter employees topush consumers toward more pricey items. &quot;They clearly wantto sell drinks and fries,&quot; both high-margin items, saysMontgomery Securities restaurant analyst Michael Mueller.   Image -- as well as profit -- is at stake. Some McDonald'soutlets had so many banners boasting low prices, &quot;it lookedlike the whole store was on sale,&quot; Mr. Paul says. Restaurantanalysts see companies keeping their discounted come-ons butrepackaging them as one of many ingredients in the valueequation.   McDonald's franchisee Harvey Ross thinks he has found away to tie service to the search for a good deal. If patronsof his Madison, N.C., stores are dissatisfied with theiroverall dining experience, they can order themselves a freelunch. &quot;We guarantee hot, fast and friendly service or thenext meal is on us,&quot; Mr. Ross explains.   &quot;Value is more than the price you pay,&quot; adds a spokesmanfor McDonald's. He says the company's new advertisingcampaign -- &quot;What you want is what you get&quot; -- reflects thatidea. The Extra Value menu will be a permanent part of that,he says.   While discounting helped prop up traffic as the recessionswept the country, some chains found themselves offering toomuch of a good deal and have backed off.   Sizzler International Inc., a 650-store steakhouse chain,says so many customers were opting for its Buffet Court, asalad bar with hot food, that the average meal checks dropped5%. &quot;It had gone well beyond 50% of our menu mix,&quot; a companyspokesman says. To recoup, Sizzler is testing a steak menufeaturing New York and other higher-quality cuts designed toraise average dinner prices.   Arby's Inc. abandoned a test of bargain-basement pricingon some roast beef sandwiches because &quot;it ran counter to thequality image we sell,&quot; a spokesman for the DWG Corp. unitsays. Instead, Arby's is promoting combo meals and will soonintroduce a line of submarine sandwiches starting at around$2.59.   In fact, a test of items grouped by price flopped atCaptain D's, a seafood chain. &quot;It was terribly confusing,&quot;says Leonard Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer ofthe company's parent, Shoney's Inc.   Low pricing has other problems. KFC franchisee John R.Neal in Columbia, Tenn., says selling cheap chicken snacks,like two pieces and a biscuit for $1.29, hurt profit marginsand cannibalized sales of full meals. He worries that ifcustomers go away unfilled, they may not come back. Instead,KFC, another Pepsico unit, is emphasizing deals on full mealsand chicken buckets, using limited-time price promotions onsmaller items.   &quot;There's an effort to push the more expensive items on themenu,&quot; says Michael Mueller, a restaurant analyst atMontgomery Securities.   Still, cheap food seems here to stay in some fashion.Wendy's International Inc., which says under-$1 specialshelped its fortunes, plans a line of salads-to-go rangingfrom a 99-cent Caesar salad to one with grilled chickenpieces that costs three times that much.   Analysts are closely watching Taco Bell for the definitivetest of how low pricing fares long term. They say that afterestablishing itself as the discount leader, the chain wouldhave a tough time abandoning that image. &quot;They are apotential victim of their own success,&quot; says Hugh Zurkuhlenof Weiss, Peck andamp; Greer. He thinks that inflation and othereconomic factors will eventually push prices up.   But Taco Bell executives say the chain isn't retreating.It's even testing a lower-priced version of its &quot;value menu,&quot;charging 10 cents less an item, in two markets. &quot;Ourcustomers' focus on price is unchanged,&quot; says Tim Ryan,senior vice president, marketing. &quot;Value continues to be theprimary driver.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
