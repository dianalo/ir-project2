The British financial-services group said any losses stemming from the questionable transactions would be insignificant and that it has agreed to compensate clients who may have had losses related to the transactions. Exco also said the fraud investigation wouldn't affect its recent agreement to be acquired by British andamp; Commonwealth Shipping Co. for a minimum the equivalent to $888 million.    Municipal Brokers, a broker of British municipal debt securities, &quot;is one of our smallest subsidiaries, with a total staff of about 12 people,&quot; said Bill Matthews, Exco's chief executive. &quot;Our lawyers and the Fraud Squad are now investigating up to three former employees who left the firm in October.&quot; Mr. Matthews declined to identify the former employees under investigation or specify alleged abuses.    Mr. Matthews said, however, that the former employees are believed to have skimmed proceeds from transactions with Exco clients. The irregular dealings were discovered through &quot;a routine clerical inquiry&quot; last month, he said. &quot;We continued the investigation and notified the Sterling Brokers Association,&quot; a self-regulatory group, &quot;the Bank of England, as well as the Fraud Sqaud after it became apparent that the former employees breached a code of conduct.&quot;    A Fraud Sqaud spokesman decline to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
