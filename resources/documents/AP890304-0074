Venezuela, the world's eighth-largest oil producer, has long beenregarded as an oasis of prosperity and stability in a region swampedby poverty and political upheaval.   But last week, rioting left at least 300 people dead.Venezuelans, accustomed to three decades of democratic rule,witnessed the specter of soldiers and tanks patrolling the capitalunder martial law.   The disturbances broke out Monday when bus fares rose 30 percentby government decree. At the same time, prices on a range of basicgoods and services such as gasoline, bread and electricity rosesharply under the government's economic-adjustment program, whichalso provided for a rise in interest rates and a currencydevaluation.   To offset price increases, the government doubled the mininumwage to the equivalent of $110 a month. But for many Venezuelans,the wage increases were cut in half by higher transport fares alone.   President Carlos Andres Perez announced the measures Feb. 16, twoweeks after taking office, to satisfy requirements of theInternational Monetary Fund and Western creditor banks. The mainrequirement was that Venezuela lift government subsidies that hadkept prices artificially low for years.   Had the government not imposed the price increases, Perez saidFriday, it would have had no chance of obtaining $4.8 billion inloans from the IMF.   He linked the civil unrest directly to Venezuela's $33 billionforeign debt, saying interest payments were consuming 70 percent ofoil revenues and undermining the nation's ability to provide for its18 million people.   Moreover, the president said debt-burdened nations throughoutLatin America were vulnerable to similar uprisings spawned byeconomic hardship.   ``I hope this painful sacrifice by our country will cause theleaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are notexaggerating when we say the crisis is serious,'' Perez said.   According to a study last year by the Caracas-based LatinAmerican Economic System, a regional think tank, the region spent$139 billion from 1982 to 1987 in servicing foreign debt. Not onlydid that not dent the obligation, debt actually grew over theperiod, mostly because of more loans just to pay interest.   If the trend continues, the organization said, the standard ofliving of Latin Americans will not return to levels of the 1970suntil the year 2000.   Venezuela is the region's fourth-largest debtor behind Brazil, at$114 billion; Mexico, at $106 billion; and Argentina, at $54 billion.   Venezuela, however, is one of the few developing countries thathas been trying to repay debt, dipping into reserves built up beforethe collapse in world oil prices in 1986. The others simplyreschedule their debt.   Peru, with a foreign debt estimated by the World Bank at $19billion, has paid almost nothing on its debt since President AlanGarcia in 1985 imposed a ceiling on debt payments of 10 percent ofthe nation's export income. Its foreign reserves have since run out,and the country has entered into a steep recession.   Venezuela's government is seeking to defer further interestpayments on its foreign debt until September. Perez said anydecision on delaying payment beyond that will depend on the successof his new economic program.   The major debtor nations have been urging creditor nations foryears to come up with a comprehensive plan for solving the debtcrisis, but no formula has emerged.   A U.S. banker based in Caracas said the Latin debt crisis couldbe traced mainly to ill-conceived government economic policies.   He said Brazil had dealt with its huge debt by printing moremoney, creating an annual inflation rate of 3,000 percent.   In Venezuela, the banker said, successive governments have triedto win popular support by maintaining low prices through subsidies.   ``The fact is they have pursued policies that would have broughtthem to the edge of economic ruin regardless of debt,'' he said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   For example, gasoline, which rose in price 80 percent, had beenselling for 6 cents a gallon.   The crunch started in the early 1980s, as an oil glut forcedprices down and the standard of living of most Venezuelans fell. Oilrevenues account for 90 percent of Venezuela's foreign exchangeearnings.   For many Venezuelans, the government's austerity measuresconfirmed that the days of prosperity were over. Years of pent-upfrustration were vented in the bloodiest rioting the country hasseen.   Perez said Venezuelans could expect at least six more months ofeconomic hardship before the economy begins to expand.</TEXT></DOC>
