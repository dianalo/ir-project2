The followingrevisions were made as a result of reviewing comments received from thenotice. At Military Department request, a proposed provision was eliminatedthat would have authorized commanders with available funds to considerproposals to acquire automated teller machines. A provision covering theprocess for consideration of a second banking institution on a DoD installationwas expanded to include both FDIC- and FSLIC-insured institutions. A proposedprovision that would have permitted installation commanders, on a one-timebasis, to renegotiate existing fair market rental real property leasesunder new nominal rental provisions was limited to extensions of such leases.Finally, the revised rule accepts clarifying and editorial changes suggestedin response to the notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Dr. R.

(2) When conditions warrant consideration of a second banking institutionon the installation, a request providing full details shall be forwardedthrough channels to the DoD Component headquarters concerned for evaluationand appropriate action. All interested institutions near the installationthat are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) orFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) should be giventhe opportunity to offer a proposal.
