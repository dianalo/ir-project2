Even if the treaty were not legally inoperative because of its unratified, expired and violated state, it wouldn't be of any practical significance because, while it might be &quot;verifiable,&quot; it cannot be said to be &quot;enforceable.&quot; In a world of sovereign states no one has devised a certain method of enforcing treaties except by force. Even those insisting most vocally on arms agreements with the Soviet Union acknowledge Soviet violations of previous agreements, such as the building of the Krasnoyarsk anti-missile battle-management radar, and concede that there is no way to enforce compliance. The U.S. has not only ruled out the use of force directly against the Soviet Union except in response to a Soviet military action against the U.S. or its allies, but has shown reluctance to use strong force even against lesser powers that have violated fundamental diplomatic conventions, such as the seizure of U.S. diplomatic personnel in Iran.    If the U.S. is unwilling to enforce agreements made with the Soviets, why does it continue to make such agreements? Would it not be better to put any future agreements in the form of &quot;declarations,&quot; such as the Atlantic Charter drawn up by Roosevelt and Churchill in 1941? (A by-product of negotiating such declarations would be to free the president from the necessity of conducting foreign policy with 100 senatorial advisors at his side.)    In an era of nuclear, biological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction, agreements that cannot be guaranteed by force, should not be incorporated in instruments that carry the implication that they can be enforced. Let such agreements, therefore, stand as aspirations, which is what they are in practical terms. Failure by one party to realize the hopes expressed in such a declaration would trigger the only response realistically open to the other party: rebuilding its own security by whatever means seem desirable. There would be no need to agonize over means of surveillance or verifiability, since they are of minor importance in an era of unenforceability. The U.S. would be saved the traumatic experience of denouncing a &quot;sacred treaty&quot; even in the face of its violation by the other side. Repudiating a declaration is easier than breaking a treaty.    To satisfy those domestic critics who require that the U.S. show its &quot;good faith&quot; by willingness to negotiate with the Soviet Union, let the president seek agreements on arms, military actions and human rights. But do not incorporate into our own respected constitutional structure legal instruments that can be ignored with impunity or repudiated in an instant by a handful of men in a nondemocratic government but can only be modified laboriously or scrapped by our own government.
