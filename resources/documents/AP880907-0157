The department's Economic Research Service said those cropsinclude apricots, clingstone peaches, bartlett pears and apples.Moreover, it said in a new outlook report, smaller inventoriesalready on hand ``will keep most canned fruit supplies tight againthis season.''   Demand from both domestic and export markets has been relativelystrong, the report said.   ``Several canned fruit prices have advanced recently because ofstrong movement, tight supplies and higher contract prices for rawfruit,'' the report added. ``Prices are expected to remain strongthroughout 1988-89.''</TEXT></DOC>
