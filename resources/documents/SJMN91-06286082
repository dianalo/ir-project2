PROGRAM  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO><TEXT>     Such coding by numbers or note-letters (A, B, C, etc.) is a game played inthe past by Bach, Elgar, Shostakovich and one of Rouse's personal favorites,Alban Berg.;   Now Rouse has taken up the cryptographic game, and thesymphony, under guest conductor David Zinman, is laying it out for all to hearin a program that includes Mahler's grand and gloomy Symphony No. 6.;   Rouseis one of the immensely talented &quot;new romantics&quot; of the late 20th century,writing in a style reminiscent of the late 19th, as shown in his award-winningSymphony No. 1, heard here three seasons ago.;   &quot;Iscariot&quot; is a sensuous anddolorous piece, full of extravagant orchestral effects, despite its use of acompact string ensemble and just a dozen assorted non-string players.;   Init, Rouse sets up an intermittent dialogue between contrasting sections of theorchestra: He keeps returning to the despondent sounds of murky strings aftersuccessive attempts at enlightenment by winds, brass and celesta. A cadenzafor a pair of kettle drums forms the centerpiece for this 13-minute opus.;  Like Berg's Violin Concerto, &quot;Iscariot&quot; also quotes the ominous Bach choraleof termination, &quot;Es ist genug&quot; (&quot;It is enough&quot;).;   &quot;I'm not called 'doom andgloom' for nothing,&quot; said the 42-year-old composer with a chuckle followingthe Thursday performance. &quot; ('Iscariot') isn't any 'Cuckoos in Spring.' &quot;;  Rouse said he hopes it will take musicologists more than a century to find allhis autobiographical references, which he firmly declines to identify.;  Writing the piece was &quot;cathartic for me,&quot; he said. &quot;It exorcised my nemeses.&quot;;  Conductor Zinman resisted any urge to counterbalance &quot;Iscariot&quot; withbrighter, more upbeat sounds. The Mahler Sixth is one of the most despondentopuses ever created, running 79 minutes. It requires a gigantic orchestra,including eight horns and six trumpets (among them, moonlighting San JoseSymphony principal trumpet James Dooley).;   Near the end of the fourth andfinal movement comes the famous &quot;blows of fate&quot; theme, achieved here with asledgehammer impact that involved some electronic enhancement -- a factreluctantly confirmed by symphony spokeswoman Isabelle Anacker.;   Zinmanclearly has mastered the cues and techniques for navigating this colossal gemof a symphony. I could feel the intensity, but not the suffering, nor passionit is meant to evoke. The music flowed by but rarely sighed its elegies.; SanFrancisco Symphony; David Zinman conducting works of Rouse and Mahler; Where:Davies Symphony Hall, Van Ness Avenue at Grove Street, San Francisco; When:Tonight, 8:30 p.m.; Sunday, 3 p.m.; Tickets: $22-$48; Call: (415) 431-5400  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL HERTELENDY, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911012  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  511  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, October 12, 199100286082,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
