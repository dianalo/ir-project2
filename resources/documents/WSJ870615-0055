CarleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AMR MDEST EUROPAIRLINES (AIR)TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hijackings of aircraft and bombings of airports, now in a lull, are bound to recur.    &quot;Few people are willing to call this {lull} anything but a temporary situation,&quot; says David Long, an official in the State Department's office of counterterrorism. &quot;There haven't been any structural changes that would lead people to say this very complex problem has been solved.&quot;    The seeds of terrorism -- political and economic unrest -- are still rife world-wide, Mr. Long notes, adding: &quot;There still are bitter people out there.&quot;    During the past decade, about a half-dozen major terrorist attacks on airplanes or airports occurred each year. But it has been nine months since the hijacking of the Pan American World Airways jet at Karachi, an incident that left 22 dead and more than 100 injured. It has been more than a year since the equally deadly attacks at the Vienna and Rome airports.    The reasons for the respite are uncertain. Some specialists say it merely reflects random timing. Some claim the U.S. bombing of Libya has inhibited terrorism sponsored by that country. They also credit recent terrorists' arrests by France, West Germany and Italy. U.S. officials had fumed over the reluctance of Europeans to take vigorous action against terrorists. Now, says a U.S. specialist, &quot;I think the Europeans almost deserve medals.&quot; He hopes the tough line will continue.    The lull may be traced in part to Syria, which last year was clearly implicated in an attempt to smuggle a bomb aboard an El Al airliner in London. The Syrians may now be trying to repair their image, a specialist in terrorism says. Syria has reportedly denied support to Abu Nidal, one of the world's most dangerous terrorists, who allegedly planned the Pan Am hijacking in Karachi as well as the bombing of an Istanbul synagogue the next day.    But airports and aircraft again will become targets, the specialists say. Airliners provide terrorists relatively easy transport to friendly or neutral turf, from which they can issue demands and exert their powerful bargaining advantage, the lives of their hostages. And aircraft and airports are physically vulnerable still. &quot;The offensive measures are so much more powerful than any available defenses,&quot; says Mike Ackerman, a former Central Intelligence Agency agent now a consultant on terrorism for U.S. corporations.    Others concur. Billie Vincent, former director of security for the Federal Aviation Administration, says, &quot;The current security for U.S. air carriers in high-threat locations -- Europe, the Middle East and Southwest Asia -- is inadequate to meet the threat against it.&quot;    Hijackers are becoming more adept at smuggling weapons aboard. Hijackers of TWA's Flight 847 in June 1985 somehow got a pistol and grenades on the aircraft. One theory involves an opaque vase with a lining of lead crystal that blocked X-rays. A passenger saw a hijacker enter a lavatory, and heard glass smashing, suggesting that weapons were hidden in a such a container.    In the annals of weapons smuggling, an incident involving Chianti wine bottles has become famous. In December 1985, guards at an airport in Cyprus confiscated two bottles carried by an airline passenger. They contained three grenades, two disassembled handguns, a silencer and 91 rounds of ammunition. Someone had drained the bottles, cut off their bottoms, inserted the weapons and then repaired the bottles. The passenger and three companions were arrested.    Hijackers have access to explosives such as book-size bombs that are hard to detect and can be detonated by such signals as changes in air pressure.    An unsuspecting Irishwoman carried the Syria-linked bomb in a bag to El Al at Heathrow last year. It passed undetected through detection machines. The trigger, also in the bag, was disguised as a calculator. Only after El Al security guards became suspicious and thoroughly inspected the bag was the bomb discovered.    FAA officials last June briefed airline officials on the new bombs.    American Airlines retained former El Al officials to consult on security and remodeled its system after the Israeli airline's. American, which formerly relied on airport security personnel and contractors, has hired more than 230 of its own security agents. They watch planes, inspect freight, check food and screen passengers. &quot;We're going to have the best security system we can,&quot; says Robert Crandall, American's chairman.    The FAA is spending millions of dollars on bomb detection. A prototype device detects explosive vapors but is also triggered by nitroglycerin tablets used by heart patients. An FAA official says it may take years to perfect a bomb-detection device. </TEXT></DOC>
