Effective Date of RegulationEPA's final regulation limiting the production and consumption of certainozone-depleting substances was published on August 12, 1988. However, theregulation specified that, with the exception of a single reporting requirement,it would take effect at the same time that the Montreal Protocol enteredinto force. According to the terms of that agreement, entry into forcewould occur on January 1, 1989, provided that at least 11 instruments ofratification, acceptance, approval of the Protocol or accession theretohad been deposited by States or regional economic integration organizationrepresenting at least two-thirds of 1986 estimated global consumption ofthe controlled substances.On December 16, 1988, according to information provided by the United NationsTreaty Office in New York City, the conditions for entry into force weresatisfied. On that day, instruments of ratification were deposited by 10nations from the European Community (EC) and by the EC itself, which broughtthe number of nations ratifying the Protocol to 25. (The United Statesdeposited its instrument of ratification in April 1988.) Together, thesenations represent more than the two-thirds of 1986 global consumption ofthe controlled substances, which was the other condition for entry intoforce.The change to the final rule contained in today's action is a technicalrevision altering the original conditional language to reflect the factthat the requirements for the Protocol's entry into force were met priorto January 1, 1989, and therefore that the Protocol and the domestic ruletook effect on that date.B. Timing of Control PeriodsIn the preamble to the August 12 final rule, EPA stated that the rule'scontrol periods would coincide with those specified in the Montreal Protocol.Since the rule itself was contingent on the Protocol's entry into forceand since the dates of some control periods were contingent on when theProtocol entered into force, EPA reserved the provision of the rule definingcontrol periods. Now that the date of the Protocol's entry into force isknown, the Agency is promulgating andSection; 82.3(f) to specify the datesof the various control periods.Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol sets forth the timing and magnitudeof the reductions that each Party must make in controlled substances. Itstates that each Party shall limit its production and consumption of GroupI substances (i.e. chlorofluorocarbons or ``CFCs'') to its 1986 levelsfor the twelve month period commencing on the first day of the seventhmonth following the date of entry into force.Article 2 of the Protocol also requires that the freeze at 1986 levelsfor Group I substances be followed by a 20 percent reduction for the periodfrom July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994, and for each 12 month period thereafter.The 20 percent reduction is followed by an additional 30 percent cut thattakes effect for the 12 month period beginning on July 1, 1998, and foreach 12 month period thereafter. Group II controlled substances (i.e. halons)are to be frozen at 1986 levels beginning on the first day of the thirty-seventhmonth after entry into force.Since the Protocol entered into force on January 1, 1989, andSection; 82.3(f)(1)of EPA's rule now provides that the first control period will begin onJuly 1, 1989, and run until June 30, 1990, and that subsequent controlperiods will run from July 1 to June 30 thereafter. Similarly, andSection;82.3(f)(2) provides that for Group II substances, the first control periodwill run from January 1 to December 31, 1992, and that subsequent controlperiods will extend from January 1 to December 31 of each year thereafter.C. Effective Date of Additions to RuleThe addition to the rule of the dates described above is effective immediately.EPA finds good cause for making an exception to the requirement that aregulation be published at least 30 days before its effective date (5 U.S.C.553(d)(3)). The rule as originally published provided that it would takeeffect when the Montreal Protocol entered into force, which it stated wouldbe January 1, 1989, if certain specified conditions were met by that date.Since those conditions were fulfilled by that date, the effective datesection of the original rule itself provided for a January 1, 1989 startdate. Thus, this notice does not change the substance of the effectivedate section, but only substitutes a date for the statement of conditionsthat determined that date. Under these circumstances, EPA finds it appropriateto make this revision to andSection; 82.2 effective immediately.For similar reasons, the Agency is making the revision to andSection; 82.3(f)effective immediately. In the preamble to the final rule, EPA stated thatthe control periods established by the rule would coincide with the controlperiods defined by the Montreal Protocol, which in turn made the datesof some periods dependent on the date the Protocol entered into force.EPA described what those control periods would be if the Protocol enteredinto force on January 1, 1989, as has occurred. Since EPA decided at thetime it promulgated the original rule that the control periods would beas defined here, provided the Protocol entered into force on January 1,1989, the Agency finds good cause to make this change to the control perioddefinition effective immediately.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection requirements contained in the final rule publishedon August 12, 1988, 53 FR 3056, have been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act</T3>, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et. seq.</T3>, and have been assigned OMB control number 2060-0170.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burdento Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork ReductionProject (2060-0170), Washington, DC 20530, marked ``Attention: Desk Officerfor EPA.''<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Don R.
