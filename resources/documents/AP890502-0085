John G. Rowland,R-Conn., said Monday. ``There were really no big problems at all.''   Cheney last week cited operational problems in the two SH-60Fsalready delivered by Sikorsky, the Stratford, Conn.-based divisionof United Technologies Corp. Cheney did include funds to keep theprogram going until future purchases can be made.   But according to briefing papers the Navy provided to Rowland, amember of the House Armed Services Committee, most of the problemseither have been fixed or are being resolved. The Navy said none ofthe failures pose a serious enough problem to prevent safe use.   The problems included improper installation of a warning lightand damaged sonar cables, according to the documents. The Navy saidthe helicopter has ``no substantial design flaws.''   Sikorsky officials also were fixing problems discovered duringthe previous year's testing, including an overly sensitiveautomatic altitude control designed to keep the craft at 50 feetabove the water. The system apparently forced the helicopter up anddown with the motion of the waves below, according to Rowland aideDavid Boomer.   The SH-60F is a modified version of Sikorsky's SH-60B Seahawk.The SH-60F, expected to replace the Sikorsky-built SH-3H, is madeto be based on aircraft carriers for anti-submarine missions. TheSH-60F lowers sonar equipment into the water and pulls it in searchof enemy subs.   Capt. Barton Strong, the Navy's program manager, told Rowland inthe private briefing Monday that the SH-60F was performing well andwould be a significant improvement over the older SH-3H, accordingto the congressman.   Strong assured Rowland that the Pentagon still supported theSH-60F program.   Navy officials told the congressman that the administrationplans to buy a total of 175 SH-60F helicopters over 13 years. Sevenwere ordered in 1987 and 18 each in fiscal 1988 and 1989. The Navyplans to return to a request of 18 in 1991, then 12 a year through1995, 17 in 1996, 24 in 1997 and 25 in 1998.   The helicopters cost about $15.8 million each.   The 1990 budget, which originally called for $313.6 million inSH-60F spending, was reduced by Cheney to $94 million to coverspare parts and advanced procurement to keep the program alive. NoSH-60Fs would be purchased in 1990 under Cheney's budget, butCongress still has to approve that plan.</TEXT></DOC>
