HughesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Bruce Blast, a model, was expounding on the many fine qualities of a Japanese juicer to a group of about 30 potential buyers at a New York trade show. He touted the juicer's versatility, its five-year guarantee and, above all, its reliability.    Then he plugged it in to demonstrate its power to pulverize a bunch of carrots. &quot;It was an ugly sound,&quot; Mr. Blast recalls. &quot;It was the sound of metal rubbing against metal.&quot; No carrot juice.    The audience laughed. &quot;We're having a slight problem,&quot; Mr. Blast said as he jiggled the product frantically. &quot;In a few minutes I'll show you how it works.&quot; But the jiggling didn't fix the juicer. &quot;I felt like an idiot,&quot; he says.    Failure is never pleasant. But it is particularly unpleasant when a product fails in front of a large group of possible customers. Product demonstrators say it happens frequently, particularly with electronic products. Car phones won't dial, printers won't print, personal computers crackle and die. But even simple products often flop in public. Microwave popcorn won't pop. Toys squirt buyers in the face.    Still, more companies are risking humiliation by offering product demonstrations. &quot;Consumers are skeptical about advertising, and demonstrations are one way to cut through the criticism and let the consumer experience the product,&quot; says Penny Peters, a senior vice president of Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc., the public-relations firm. She warns, however, that &quot;there can be failure and embarrassment if the product isn't tested first.&quot;    A well-trained demonstrator often can hide a failure by talking about a product's many advantages while ignoring the actual performance. If the failure has drawn attention, many demonstrators make calming speeches about warranty plans. But some demonstrators, particularly models and actors hired on little notice, panic and become speechless or joke nervously. In any case, the sale often falls through.    That is what happened when Frank J. Feitz attempted to demonstrate a phone system installed by Interconnect Planning Corp. to a group of executives from Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. The group flew from New Jersey to Tulsa, Okla., to see the system at work at a facility of American Airlines. The trouble started at the door.    &quot;Just a minute, our phones aren't working,&quot; said the receptionist. &quot;I'll have to walk back to tell them you're here.&quot;    Things only got worse. An irate American Airlines manager arrived and told the group that lightning had struck the system that morning and that a backup system had also failed. The manager also talked about the time he instructed all the employees to dial out at exactly the same moment to test the system -- causing it to crash.    Mr. Feitz, who was then an executive of Interconnect Planning, had to say something to the Aandamp;P executives. &quot;You've seen the worst, and obviously we're not going to let this happen to you,&quot; he said. It didn't help. A week later, the Aandamp;P executives called to say no, thanks, to the phone system.    Perhaps the only fate worse than having a product fail is having it attack prospective buyers. It happens with some of the smallest and most innocuous products. Sharon Hanian, a former Miss Iowa, was demonstrating a plastic squeeze bottle at an Iowa State Fair in front of about 40 people. &quot;Don't you just hate it when you shake and shake a bottle and the lotion just doesn't come out?&quot; Ms. Hanian asked.    A few people nodded.    &quot;Wouldn't it be nice if someone designed a bottle so the lotion would just come out in nice, even increments?&quot;    More people nodded.    That is when Ms. Hanian gave the bottle a good strong squeeze and the cap flew off -- followed by the lotion, which landed on one woman in a dress and three men in business suits. They screamed. Ms. Hanian's instinct was to leave, but she didn't. &quot;Obviously, we've all experienced this,&quot; she said quickly. She grabbed a towel and began wiping the lotion off the irked observers.    No sale for the bottle's maker, whom Ms. Hanian declines to identify.    Even people who only buy wholesale can be victimized by balky products. Frank Lott was demonstrating Slime, a Mattel Inc. product, at a New York trade show when the head buyer of a large department store walked by.    &quot;This is great!&quot; gushed a Mattel salesman working with Mr. Lott. &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; said the buyer as the salesman dumped the green gelatinous plaything into the buyer's hand.    &quot;We were dealing with a bad batch of Slime&quot; recalls Mr. Lott. &quot;Someone had messed up on the recipe.&quot; The Slime, which is supposed to come right off, stuck to the buyer's hand. &quot;This isn't right! This isn't right!&quot; cried the buyer as the salesman frantically tried to remove the gooey mess. Mr. Lott ran to get a napkin and eventually the two men scrubbed off the Slime. The buyer left looking less than enchanted.    A highly trained demonstrator can turn a truly hideous moment into a sales pitch for the company. Teresa Paton was demonstrating photocopiers for Ricoh Co., a Japanese firm, at a trade show in New Orleans when the paper jammed. No copy. &quot;I'm so glad this happened!&quot; said Ms. Paton with enthusiasm, as she had been instructed to do if the situation arose. &quot;Now I have an opportunity to show you how to remove a paper jam!&quot; She also discussed Ricoh's fine repair team.    The buyers stuck around and watched, but Ms. Paton doesn't know whether they bought any of the copiers.    Those less trained are likely to bring demonstrations to an immediate halt after failures. Vermont Jacobs was hired to demonstrate a personal computer made by Apple Computer Inc. at a Philadelphia trade show. But when he plugged in the machine in front of a small group, it didn't demonstrate &quot;the power to be your best,&quot; as the advertisements promise. &quot;It was a green screen and it just flickered and then went totally black,&quot; he says.    Mr. Jacobs skipped his speech. &quot;I was very embarrassed and a little upset,&quot; he says. &quot;I started laughing and the buyers started laughing. We were all laughing.&quot; Mr. Jacobs told his audience to come back in a few hours; by that time he had a new machine that worked just fine.    There are demonstrators who persist -- sometimes for days -- despite repeated failures. Gail Wise was hired to demonstrate the strength of Yellobags, a yellow garbage bag made by a unit of General Plastics Corp. in Miami. Her assignment was to stand in a Dallas grocery store and prove that two competing brands were weaker by pulling them down over the head of a bottle until they broke. Then she had to do the same to the Yellobags to show that they wouldn't break.    Ms. Wise did as she was told. Sure enough, the leading brands fell apart. Then came the Yellobag. It broke, too. &quot;I wanted to hide,&quot; says Ms. Wise, who turned to the assembled shoppers and said, &quot;That was a defect.&quot; But the same thing happened the next two times. &quot;I guess they just want your money,&quot; muttered one shopper. Others laughed.    &quot;I thought, 'This stuff doesn't work and I have to be here for eight more hours today,'&quot; Ms. Wise recalls. Altogether, Ms. Wise spent two days at the grocery store. She says the Yellobags broke about 30% of the time.    Last year a saleswoman sought to convince AFG Industries Inc. of the merits of a novelty drinking glass. She told Roger Kennedy, vice president of marketing of the Irvine, Calif., glass producer and distributor, that when ice water was added, the image of a Christmas tree -- complete with decorations -- would appear on the glass in 15 to 20 seconds.    The woman set the glass on Mr. Kennedy's desk and added water and then ice. A couple of minutes went by. The two were still staring at a plain tumbler filled with ice water. &quot;I don't think I'm interested,&quot; said Mr. Kennedy, finally.    &quot;This is unbelievable. It worked 20 minutes ago,&quot; the woman said. &quot;I can go back to my office and get another one.&quot;    No dice. &quot;You've spent enough time,&quot; replied Mr. Kennedy, showing the product demonstrator the door. </TEXT></DOC>
