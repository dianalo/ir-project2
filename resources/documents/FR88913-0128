Background </ITAG>Under section 1816 of the Social Security Act, public or private organizationsand agencies participate in the administration of Part A (Hospital Insurance)of the Medicare program under agreements with the Secretary of Health andHuman Services. These agencies or organizations are known as fiscal intermediaries,and they perform bill processing and benefit payment functions for theMedicare program. Most providers of services (such as hospitals, skillednursing facilities (SNFs), and home health agencies (HHAs)) submit billsto these intermediaries, which determine whether the services are coveredunder Medicare and determine correct payment amounts. The intermediariesthen make payments to the providers on behalf of the beneficiaries. Under section 1842 of the Act, we are authorized to enter into contractswith carriers to fulfill various functions in the administration of PartB (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program. Beneficiaries,physicians and suppliers of services submit claims to these carriers. Thecarriers determine whether the services are covered under Medicare andthe reimbursable amount (usually on the basis of reasonable charges) forthe services or supplies and then make payment to the appropriate party.Under section 1816(f) of the Act, we are required to develop criteria,standards, and procedures to evaluate an intermediary's performance ofits functions under its agreement with us. We evaluate intermediary performancethrough the Contractor Performance Evaluation Program (CPEP). Our regulationsat 42 CFR 421.120 provide for publication of <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices to announce criteria and standards applicableduring each fiscal year. Under section 1842(b)(2) of the Act, we are required to develop criteria,standards, and procedures to evaluate a carrier's performance of its functionsunder its agreement with us. Since 1981, we have evaluated carrier performanceunder CPEP using criteria and standards similar to those used for intermediaries.Under section 1842(a) of the Act, the Secretary is authorized to enterinto contracts with carriers, including carriers with which agreementsunder section 1816 are in effect, to perform some or all of the MedicarePart B functions. As a result of section 2326(c) of Pub L. 98-369, the Deficit ReductionAct of 1984 (DEFRA), we publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> the criteria and standards used to evaluate bothintermediaries' and carriers' performance in order to allow the publican opportunity to comment before implementing them. This notice announcesthe FY 1989 criteria and standards to be used to measure the effectivenessand efficiency of both intermediaries and carriers.In addition, section 2326(a) of DEFRA established the Secretary's statutoryauthority to replace up to two Part A and up to two Part B contractorswhich, over a period of time, have been in the lowest 20th percentile ofMedicare contractors, as measured by performance criteria and standards.The contractor community has played a significant role in developing theDEFRA methodology. By publishing the methodology for applying the DEFRArequirements in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, it is HCFA's intention to afford this formalcomment opportunity each year in the notice which conveys the performancecriteria and standards. The ongoing exchange of ideas and comments whichoccurs through interaction between HCFA and its contractors will also continue,as in the past.Section 9332(a) of Pub. L. 99-509, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1986 (OBRA'86), and section 4085(i)(2)(B) of Pub. L. 100-203, the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA'87), require that HCFA developa system to measure a carrier's performance in increasing the proportionof participating physicians or total payments for services furnished byparticipating physicians and to provide for the payment of a bonus to carriersfor success. This system is the subject of another notice being preparedfor publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Also, we will notify all carriers of the systemas soon as possible.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Fiscal Year (FY) 1989 Criteria and Standards_General</ITAG>In FY 1988 we redesigned CPEP to focus on more results and output orientedmeasures in an effort to create a more enhanced measurement total. ForFY 1989, we have retained that redesign and have made changes only wherenecessary to improve the standards already existing, or to comply withrecent legislative mandates.In maintaining the basic design of CPEP, we have retained the same functionalcriteria for both intermediaries and carriers. For intermediaries, thereare eleven separate functional criteria, and for carriers, there are ten.Within each functional criterion we have identified the performance standardswhich, when measured, will evidence how well each contractor is performing.Each of these standards will fall into one of the three basic key indicatorsor categories (cost, quality (accuracy), or timeliness) and each will beassigned points ranging from zero to 160.The major changes between the 1989 CPEP and the program for 1988 are thechanges which were required as a result of OBRA'87. Essentially, thesechanges are the modification of existing standards or the creation of newstandards to measure contractor adherence to requirements that (1) no claimspayment is made before the fifteenth day after date of receipt (incorporatedinto all claims processing timeliness standards); (2) appeals are processedwithin the mandated timeframes; (3) the rate of reversals on appeal forintermediaries is appropriate; and (4) the participating physician programis carried out effectively.Action Based on Performance EvaluationsWe may, as in previous years, initiate administrative actions as a resultof the evaluation of intermediary and carrier performance based on theseperformance criteria and standards. Under sections 1816 and 1842 of theSocial Security Act, we consider the results of the evaluation in our determinationson:1. Entering into, renewing, or terminating agreements with contractors;and2. Decisions concerning other contract actions for intermediaries and carriers(such as deletion of an automatic renewal clause). These are made on acase-by-case basis and depend primarily on the nature and degree of performance.More specifically, they depend on:a. Relative overall performance compared to other contractors;b. Number of standards in which superior, average, or deficient performanceoccurs;c. Extent of each failure; andd. Relative significance of the standards for which superior or deficientperformance occurs within the overall CPEP.In addition, we consider the results of our evaluation of the intrermediaryin determinations we make concerning assignment or reassignment of providersand designation of regional or national intermediaries for classes of providers.We make individual contract action decisions after considering these factorsin terms of their relative significance and impact on the efficient administrationof the Medicare program.<T3>Replacement of Contractors Through Competitive Bidding.</T3> Section2326(a) of Pub L. 98-369 (DEFRA) allows HCFA to use competitive biddingto replace a contractor whose performance over a period of time has beenin the lowest 20th percentile as measured by performance criteria and standards.In FY 1985 and FY 1986, section 2326(a) authorized HCFA to enter into twointermediary agreements and two carrier contracts based on competitivebidding, without regard to provider nomination rights, in order to replacelow ranking intermediaries and carriers. The authority to replace poorperformers under provisions of section 2326(a) was extended through theend of FY 1989 by section 9321(b) of Pub L. 99-509. Section F of this noticeoutlines the methodology for complying with section 2326(a) of DEFRA forFY 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Scoring System</ITAG>For both intermediaries and carriers, the maximum score attainable is 1000points. Each of the CPEP's functional criteria is assigned a given portionof the 1000 available points. One of the requirements for passing CPEPis that 70 percent of the available points <T3>for each criterion</T3> must be attained.In addition, within a functional criterion is one or more standards categorizedas either a cost, quality, or timeliness measure. Each of the standardsis assigned a portion of the total points for that functional criterion.Each standard has a method of evaluation that is used to calculate a ratingbased on a contractor's performance in that standard. The second requirementfor passing CPEP is that 70 percent of the total points assigned to thecost standards, quality/accuracy standards, and timeliness standards mustalso be attained.A contractor's performance is evaluated against each applicable standard.In general, if a contractor exactly meets the requirements for a standard,it achieves 70 percent of the points allocated to that standard, to whichwe refer as the threshold score. Any rating below that threshold (i.e.,less than 70 percent) constitutes a deficiency. The contractor may be requiredto develop and implement a corrective action plan when performance problemsare identified. The contractor will be monitored to assure eeffective andefficient compliance with the corrective action plan and improved performancewhere criteria are not met.<ITAG tagnum="84">D.

L. 99-369 will be as follows:andbullet; Performance, as measured by the Secretary's criteria and standards,will be considered for the 3 fiscal years 1987, 1988, and 1989.andbullet; Each year's overall performance will be captured in the form ofan unweighted, base efficiency rating_points earned as a percentage ofpoints available, as determined by the performance criteria and standards.andbullet; Each year's efficiency rating will be weighted to provide extraemphasis for the most recent performance. The weights, to be multipliedby each year's efficiency rating, are:<ITAG tagnum="73">Year and Weight</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="38">1989</ITAG>.....3<ITAG tagnum="38">1988</ITAG>.....2<ITAG tagnum="38">1987</ITAG>.....1andbullet; Each year's weighted efficiency rating will be summed and thecontractors ranked (Part A and Part B separately) from highest points tolowest points.andbullet; Careful study of the bottom 20th percentile of contractors willbe undertaken to fully assess considerations such as performance that isimproving/deteriorating, factors beyond the contractor's control, and otherfactors pertinent to a particular territory.<ITAG tagnum="84">G. Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>1. Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any major rule. A major rule is definedas a rulemaking document, including a notice such as this one, that wouldresult in: (1) An annual economic impact of $100 million or more; (2) Amajor increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or any geographical regions;or (3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.We do not expect this notice to meet any of these criteria. Preliminaryanalyses reveal that the FY 1989 CPEP may reduce the Federal resourcesrequired to administer these criteria and standards as more efficient evaluationmethodologies are being used. We expect little, if any, impact on contractorcosts since the criteria and standards measure functional responsibilitiesthat the contractor must be performing anyway as a Medicare contractor.We also expect the effects on both competition and productivity to be favorable,not adverse, and the effects, if any, on employment, inveatment, and innovationto be negligible. For these reasons, we have determined that a regulatoryimpact analysis is not required.2. Regulatory Flexibility ActWe generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unlessthe Secretary certifies that a notice such as this would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, intermediaries and carriers are not small entities, althoughwe treat all providers and suppliers as small entities.The direct effect of this notice is on our intermediaries and carriers.Since they are not small entities, even though we expect this notice tohave an effect on contractor operations, an analysis of that impact isnot required. However, it is clear that many standards, such as those governingbill processing, beneficiary services, and provider services, will haveindirect effects on a substantial number of providers and suppliers. Therefore,in order to verify that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required,we assessed whether the indirect impact on those small entities will besignificant.Generally, the operations to which the standards of the intermediary andcarrier performance criteria refer are required by law, other regulations,contract, or other program instructions. These criteria provide an evaluationprocess and do not in themselves require the performance of the operationsthey evaluate. The most important indirect effect on providers and suppliersis to ensure that they are paid timely and accurately. We do not expectthese criteria and standards to have any indirect adverse effects on them.Therefore, we have determined that the evaluation process in and of itselfwill not have a significant impact on providers and suppliers. For thesereasons, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this noticewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities, and we have, therefore, not prepared a regulatory flexibilityanalysis.Furthermore, we have not prepared a rural impact statement because thisproposed rule would not have a significant impact on the operations ofa substantial number of small rural hospitals.3.
