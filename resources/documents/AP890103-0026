But the U.S. government contends Carmine Esposito isthe ``Al Capone of Italy,'' a ruthless mob boss linked to a dozenkillings.   Esposito, 31, facing a Jan. 13 deportation hearing, is fighting areturn to Italy that he says would mean certain death at the handsof mobsters or corrupt law enforcement officials.   ``Would the `Al Capone of Italy' come to Chicago and work like adog? Would he leave behind his protection and his money?'' hedemanded in a recent interview from the federal MetropolitanCorrectional Center, where he has been held in solitary confinementfor 21 months.   ``Would the `Al Capone of Italy get up at 4 a.m. each day to gobuy meat, to make sausage alone, to deliver it at night ... not haveenough time in a day to even wash yourself?''   But the U.S. government has concluded that Esposito is the mannamed in an extradition request from Italian authorities.   The document charges that Esposito ordered or committed 12killings in Italy from April 1982 through June 1983 while holding atop post in the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, a criminal clan similarto the Mafia that operates in and around Naples, near Esposito'shometown of Acerra, Italy.   ``Esposito is big fish,'' said Italian Judge Vicenzo Scolastico,who was involved in the investigation of the organization.   ``As a member of the (Camorra's policy-making) Council of Nine,Esposito had people strangled. Some had to dig their own gravesbefore they were shot. Bodies were mutilated or disappeared.   ``He is one of the last great Nuova Camorra figures still atlarge, and if he ever decided to talk, he could cast light on manyunsolved crimes,'' Scolastico added in an interview with The ChicagoTribune.   Esposito was arrested in March 1987 as he and several employeesfinished lunch at Bravissimo, the modestly successful restaurant heand his wife opened in May 1986. He also worked as a chef there, andearlier had worked as an auto body repairman, car salesman andsausage-maker.   He entered the United States in 1984, had no trouble with the lawand appeared to have been what he claimed _ a contented,hard-working immigrant whose sweat earned him a growing business anda home in the suburbs. He earned enough money to send his childrento parochial schools.   But all that changed with Esposito's arrest. A lengthy courtfight drained his resources and forced his family onto public-aidrolls. He also said his prison confinement has worsened a heartcondition.   ``The authorities make him out to be a one-man crime wave,'' saidEsposito's attorney, Philip Parenti, ``and for all that, there isnot one eyewitness, one photograph, one fingerprint.   ``There is not one piece of corroborating evidence, except forthe pentiti.''   ``Pentiti,'' which literally means ``penitent'' but has taken onthe more pedestrian definition ``informant.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Scorza argued that even thoughsome informants' criminal histories might raise questions, thosematters are best addressed in Italian courts. The U.S. governmentdoes not have to prove Esposito's innocence or guilt, Scorza said.   ``Besides,'' he said, ``the witnesses almost always are(informants) in gangster cases. And in this instance, the peoplepointing at him are saying, `I did it with him.'   ``They're not doing it to save their necks. They're confessing tothe crimes as well.''   Esposito admits to having known Camorra members while working athis father's auto body shop in Acerra, to fixing their getaway carsand on at least one occasion, to sawing off the barrels of shotguns.   His refusal to join the Camorra, he said, resulted in harassmentby Italian police, and later in his decision to pack up his familyand run. He left Acerra and spent the next three years in severalItalian cities _ Caserta, then Rome and Milan, before heading forthe United States.   ``In Italy, the Camorra have so much influence with thegovernment and with police, there is no way to be safe,'' he said.``Always I think, `If only I am successful to reach the UnitedStates, it will be different.   ``Now,'' he concluded, ``I am not so sure.''</TEXT></DOC>
