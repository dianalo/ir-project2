The lastcommercial nuclear power plant order by a domestic utility was in 1978.Based on a domestic construction schedule shown historically to lastas much as 12 yr, this would mean that construction of all plants currentlyon order would be completed by 1990. Furthermore, it is generally agreedthat the next domestic order for a new nuclear power plant will occurduring the decade of the 1990s. Thus, 1990 can be considered to be theconjunction of two major eras in the domestic application of nuclearenergy.</TEXT></DOC>
