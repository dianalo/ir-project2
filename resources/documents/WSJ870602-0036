The strong plea came in a brief filed by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the case of R. Foster Winans, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, and two other men who are appealing their convictions for securities fraud.    The brief argues that the anti-fraud provision of federal securities law is intended to penalize far more than classic insider trading, in which nonpublic information is obtained directly from officials of a company.    The U.S. officials argue that securities law is intended to penalize the use of any improperly obtained information in stock trading. This broad idea, which has come to be called the &quot;misappropriation&quot; theory of securities fraud, is of vital importance in the government's cases against several Wall Street figures, the SEC has said.    &quot;The misappropriation theory fills what would otherwise be a large and illogical loophole in the securities laws,&quot; the brief argues. Cases in which securities fraud doesn't involve a corporate insider &quot;unfortunately occur with some frequency,&quot; the brief says, citing in a footnote SEC civil lawsuits against former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. investment banker Martin Siegel, takeover speculator Ivan Boesky, and former investment banker Dennis Levine.    &quot;In such cases,&quot; the brief argues, the fraud is illegal &quot;even if the defendant is not an insider and the information does not originate in the target company.&quot;    But the government's theory is controversial. The Supreme Court has twice hinted at the possibility of going after securities fraud based on misappropriation of information, but has never ruled on what the theory means or how broad it is.    &quot;If there is a void and a loophole, the question is whether it should be filled by government prosecutors and by the courts in a case-by-case basis, or by Congress,&quot; says Harvey Pitt, a former SEC general counsel who represents Mr. Boesky.    Lawyers for Mr. Winans and the other defendants have argued at trial and on appeal that although their clients' conduct may have violated Journal policy, it didn't violate federal law.    The convictions were for mail, wire and securities fraud. In the brief, federal officials contend that the mail and wire fraud were based on Mr. Winans deceiving the Journal and using Journal information for his own benefit.    Once it is determined that the information was obtained fraudulently, the brief says, then the information also becomes the basis of the securities fraud claim of misappropriation.    Federal officials say in the brief that there is no basis for the three defendants' claim that because of the novelty of the legal theory, they had no way of knowing their conduct was illegal.    In a footnote, the officials also describe as &quot;preposterous&quot; a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press suggesting that the prosecution of Mr. Winans raises problems with the First Amendment free press guarantee.    In developing the misappropriation theory in the Winans appeal, federal officials are putting much on the line. The conventional misappropriation case, like the recent Wall Street scandals, involves the taking of information, whether directly or indirectly, from a company that is in some way participating in the securities markets.    But by any reading, the Winans case -- in which he is accused of improperly taking information from The Wall Street Journal -- is at the further reaches of the theory. If the government is successful in the Winans case, misappropriation theory will have few limits. But if the government loses, the question is whether the court rejects the far extension of the theory, or whether the ruling casts doubt on the theory even in more conventional cases. </TEXT></DOC>
