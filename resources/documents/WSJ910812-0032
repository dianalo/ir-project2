Led by a decline in energy and food prices, the 0.2%decrease in the Labor Department's producer price index wasthe second drop in a row after a string of only slightincreases. Other recent inflation measures, includingconsumer prices and labor costs, have sent similar signals.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Inflation pressures are definitely subsiding,&quot; saidKathleen Stephansen, senior economist for Donaldson, Lufkin andamp;Jenrette Securities Corp. &quot;This is a very good report andshould be a welcome development for the Fed.&quot;   However, many economists doubted the report would sparkany immediate move by the Federal Reserve to reduce interestrates further.   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, producerprices edged up 0.2% during the month after being flat themonth before.   The prices producers charged for food fell 0.8% in July.Vegetables led the drop. Tomatoes, lettuce and snap beanstumbled more than 30% during the month. Prices of vegetableshad skyrocketed in May and April because of weather damage tocrops.   Gasoline costs dropped more than 5% in July, causingenergy prices as a whole to fall 1.3%. Other energy prices,including natural gas and home heating oil, were up lastmonth.   While many economists viewed the Labor Department's reportas a sign that inflation had diminished, some others said itwas still too early to tell. &quot;The real test of whetherinflation has subsided or is just in a lull will come in thefall when spending typically picks up&quot; for the purchase ofback-to-school items and new styles of durable goods, saidJoel Popkin, head of an economic analysis firm here bearinghis name.   Prices of intermediate, or partly processed, goods fell0.3%, and prices of crude goods rose a modest 0.2%.Economists read these figures as a further indication of slowrecovery from the recession. Prices of these goods usuallyrise more substantially during an upturn as businesses demandmore of them to step up production. All the figures areadjusted for seasonal changes.   In recent weeks, a number of reports have pointed to aslow recovery: The money supply has been declining,businesses cut their payrolls by 51,000 in July, consumercredit fell in June, and a survey of 12 Federal Reservedistricts showed businesses and banks felt the recovery wasslow and uneven.   In response, the Fed last week cut a key short-terminterest rate, the federal funds rate, to 5.5% from 5.75% totry to boost the economy. The federal funds rate is the ratebanks charge each other for overnight loans.   ---                      PRODUCER PRICES                                                                                                          Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes(1982=100) for July, before seasonal adjustment, and thepercentage changes from July, 1990.
