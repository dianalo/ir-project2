Most traders expect the report to show that the March 1 hog population in 10 major hog-producing states was up only moderately from March 1987. That would help ease fears that last year's high pork prices had spurred farmers to rapidly expand their herds, which would tend to depress prices.    Based on market estimates of only a moderate rise in the hog population, optimistic traders have pushed the hog contract for April delivery to a premium over the spot market.    Such a premium is unusual. The April contract usually trades below the spot market because cash prices normally hit bottom in the first two weeks of April.    All this is making the hog futures market somewhat vulnerable to a big drop if traders are surprised by a report that is notorious for surprises, analysts said.    &quot;The market is very nervous,&quot; said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. He said hog-futures prices fell slightly yesterday as some traders got out of the market.    Estimates of the rise in the hog population range from 3% to 8%. Among those taking the middle ground are such analysts as Charles Levitt of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Chicago. He expects the Agriculture Department's March 1 survey to show that the hog population grew only 5% to 6% to roughly 40.5 million head. He is also estimating that the hog population's two components -- the number of hogs slated for slaughter and the number of hogs kept for breeding purposes -- each grew 5% to 6% from March 1987.    Mr. Levitt said the big debt burden of most hog producers prevented them from expanding as aggressively as was predicted last year.    Fears of a herd expansion began to dissipate earlier this year when the Agriculture Department reported in its December survey that the hog population grew 7% instead of the 10% that had been widely estimated by market analysts.    Mr. Morgan of Sterling has one of the most bearish forecasts for the futures market. He expects the Agriculture Department to report Thursday that the March hog population was up 7%. If accurate, such a number would probably deflate hog futures prices, he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices firmed as the March contract expired and traders began to anticipate greater demand for copper in the second quarter. March delivery copper ended its trading life at $1.0425 a pound, for a loss of 3.35 cents, as the supply of copper in Commodity Exchange warehouses continued more than adequate to satisfy outstanding March contracts. The key May delivery rose 2.75 cents to $1.0325, and other futures contracts also posted gains. Peter Cardillo, futures trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., New York, foresaw the possibility of a slight easing in copper prices over the near term &quot;but by May we'll see gains of about 10 cents a pound from current levels.&quot; The improved economy will increase demand for copper, he said. J. Clarence Morrison, metals analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York, said the fundamental picture with respect to production hasn't changed, with such major producers as Chile, Peru, Zambia and Zaire still having production problems. Mr. Morrison estimated that Chile, the world's leading producer, may suffer a drop in production this year of as much as 100,000 tons from last year, because of rock bursts, or explosions of ceilings, at one mine and other difficulties at an open-pit mine. &quot;This along with anticipated stronger demand could lead to higher prices for the near to intermediate term,&quot; Mr. Morrison said.    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Futures prices fell for major currencies in the face of a strong rebound by the dollar. &quot;There's a possibility that the latest drop in the dollar may have run its course,&quot; said Anne Mills, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. &quot;We're expecting a modest rally in the dollar&quot; and a corresponding decline in foreign currency futures prices from current levels, she said. Analysts said the dollar's rebound began in the Tokyo market Monday night New York time and followed the sun to London, New York and Chicago. The turnaround in Tokyo was sparked by comments indicating support for the dollar from Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. The Bank of Japan also reportedly entered the currency markets to buy dollars, traders said. Fears that the dollar might continue to drop and trigger massive sales of dollar-denominated assets by Japanese insurance companies when their fiscal year begins April 1 have largely dissipated, traders said.    SUGAR: Futures prices ended lower as an early advance couldn't be sustained. May delivery sugar settled at 8.99 cents a pound for a loss of 0.15 cent, after at one point rising to as much as 9.22 cents. Analysts said that a wire-service report of a &quot;swap&quot; deal between Cuba and China that lessened the need for China to be a buyer in the world market was a price-depressing factor. According to the report, a British trade firm will supply China with an estimated 300,000 tons of raw sugar and Cuba will ship an equal amount to the trade firm early in 1989. Cuba can't now meet its commitments to China because drought has delayed and reduced the Cuban crop, an analyst said. &quot;But it will have the sugar early next year,&quot; the analyst said. </TEXT></DOC>
