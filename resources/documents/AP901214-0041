The United States voted against the measures Thursday nightafter its representative Jack Stein complained to the assembly that``such divisive language does not promote the cause of peace.''   The assembly adopted the measures by wide margins.   The United States has been struggling to remove languageendorsing a Mideast peace conference from a draft resolution of themore influential U.N. Security Council, fearing it would look likea concession to Iraq.   Israel, a traditional U.S. ally, vehemently opposes any suchconference. A U.S. veto of the proposal could jeopardize thetenuous Arab coalition the United States has aligned against Iraq,which has championed the Palestinian call for a homeland since itinvaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.   A Security Council vote on the resolution has been put off sixtimes in a week. Another one is tentatively planned for Monday.   Cuban Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon, in rallying the assembly toendorse a peace conference, declared, ``There is a need for acomprehensive peace in the Middle East based on the withdrawal ofIsraeli from the occupied territories.''   The resolution endorsing a peace conference was adopted 99 to 19with 32 abstentions. Israel, the United States and several Europeannations were among those voting against it.   The resolution also condemned ``Israel's aggression'' againstthe Palestinians and declared that U.S. military and economic aidhas ``encouraged Israel to pursue its aggressive and expansionistpolicies'' in the occupied lands.   It also declared that strategic U.S.-Israeli cooperation has``had adverse effects on efforts for the establishment of acomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.''   Stein protested that ``the United States remains firmlysupportive of efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace,'' but addedthat ``the shape of a final settlement cannot be dictated by anyparty in advance.''   The General Assembly adopted another resolution condemningIsraeli occupation and called on member states ``to put an end tothe flow to Israel of any military, economic, financial andtechnological aid.''   Stein said a call to halt aid to Israel was ``unacceptable'' andobjected to the ``critical reference to the United States'' in theclause on U.S.-Israeli cooperation.   The assembly also passed resolutions declaring Israeliadministration of Jerusalem ``illegal'' and calling for greatercooperation between the United Nations and the Arab League.   Israel seized the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank,including east Jerusalem, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.</TEXT></DOC>
