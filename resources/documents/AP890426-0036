Cheney told Congress on Tuesday that he remains a strongadvocate of Star Wars, known formally as the Strategic DefenseInitiative, but is recommending that the budget for fiscal 1990 becut to $4.6 billion from the $5.9 billion proposed by formerPresident Reagan.   He said President Bush ``believes very deeply that we need to goforward with strategic defense.''   Much SDI research will focus on the Brilliant Pebbles concept,said Cheney, although SDI officials later said that weapon is oneof several space-based anti-missile satellites under consideration.   The budget level for Star Wars ``will buy us the capability tolook aggressively at Brilliant Pebbles,'' said Cheney. ``IfBrilliant Pebbles does not work out, the ultimate deployment dateof the current space-based missile program would slip by twoyears.'' He did not set a date.   Plans call for the president and Congress to decide in 1993 or1994 whether to go ahead with Star Wars, said Pentagon spokesmen.Several years later, deployment could begin on the first elements,surveillance satellites and ground-based missiles.   Brilliant Pebbles drew backing from the outgoing SDI chief, Lt.Gen. James Abrahamson, who predicted in a Feb. 9 memorandum that itcould be deployed in space for about $25 billion, far underestimates of $45 billion for other SDI orbital systems.   The concept calls for between 3,000 and 5,000 satellites, aboutthree feet long and weighing less than 100 pounds apiece, to beplaced in orbit up to 400 miles above the earth, according toretired Lt. Gen. Daniel O. Graham, a strong backer of Star Wars.   Each satellite would be housed in a protective cocoon, called a``life jacket,'' from which it would be ejected in time of war. Ifeverything worked, sensors aboard the satellites would spot andtrack enemy boosters, and rockets would propel the ``pebbles''toward the boosters, destroying them before they could releasetheir warheads.   The other space-based interceptor (SBI) under considerationcalls for several hundred satellites, each armed with about a dozeninterceptors, which would be fired at enemy boosters.   Brilliant Pebbles and SBI rely on a Boost Surveillance andTracking Satellite, in high earth orbit, designed to spot boostersat launch.   Brilliant Pebbles is the brainchild of Lowell Wood, a physicistat the federal Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California. He is aprotege of Edward Teller, who is known as the father of thehydrogen bomb and helped persuade Reagan to launch his Star Warscampaign.   Cheney's remarks drew applause from SDI backers and skepticismfrom Star Wars critics, who note that any space-based system wouldviolate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and thus lead to anew round in the arms race.   Graham, the head of the pro-Star Wars lobbying group HighFrontier, said he was ``delighted'' by Cheney's remarks.   Critics noted that the Pentagon has done relatively little workso far on Brilliant Pebbles.   ``The fundamental problem is that there is no `there' there. Atthis point it is just a neat idea,'' said John Pike, director ofspace research for the Federation of American Scientists.   ``I think it is entirely premature for the administration to bemaking the claim that this will pan out,'' said Pike, callingCheney's remarks ``a triumph of faith over fact.''   SDI is spending $40 million on Brilliant Pebbles this year, atiny fraction of its overall budget and only 10 percent of the $400million it is spending on two ground-based interceptors that wouldlikely also be deployed in any anti-missile defense.   The Brilliant Pebbles budget for fiscal 1990 has not beendisclosed, but an SDI spokesman, Maj. Alan Freitag, said ``wecertainly take our direction from the secretary of defense and theadministration. Technology will also be a determining factor.''   SDI spokesmen stressed that Brilliant Pebbles was just onepossible component in a system that would include layers ofsurveillance satellites, space-based kill vehicles and ground-basedanti-missile missiles.   ``It's just one element among space-based interceptors that weare looking at,'' Col. Louis Seelig, the SDI comptroller, toldreporters.   Brilliant Pebbles is not what SDI officials call a ``maturetechnology,'' on which much research has been done, said Capt.Bruce Jackson, another SDI spokesman. But ``it is probably anadvanced concept that we could bring to fruition quickly'' and at alower cost than other versions.   The SDI director, Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., is scheduledto appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee next Tuesdayto explain exactly how the lower budget proposal would affect SDIresearch through fiscal 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
