Consider the following trend:   In late 1989 we were warned that our prison population haddoubled in the past nine years. More recently, the JusticeDepartment reported the total prison population rose 6% inthe first six months of 1990. That's a rate of 12% a year,which means it will double every six years.</LP><TEXT>   With our current socio-political strategies in place,we'll have 1.2% of our people locked up in 12 years, nearly20% in 36 years. What problem are we solving? What'shappening to the education component?   While everyone agrees that education is a necessaryelement of the war on drugs, not everyone is aware that ourschools are serving up programs that actually cause childrento be more experimental. Courses based on humanisticpsychology and the Maslow-Rogers theories of non-directivetherapy have produced evidence for the past 15 years thatthey have the opposite effect from that which was intended.   Two studies showed that, compared with control groups thatgot no &quot;treatment,&quot; there was &quot;quicker and wider use ofalcohol, tobacco, and cannabis&quot; among the students receivingsuch discussion-group courses.   The &quot;decision-making&quot; process tells children to lookwithin themselves for answers that truly do not lie there.After the first step of identifying the problem, the secondstep is &quot;examine the alternatives.&quot; For a child who has beentaught abstention from drugs and pre-marital sex,&quot;alternative&quot; leaps off the page as something he neverrealized existed before. What's the alternative toabstention?   Children must surely be taught that drugs that alterthinking and feeling are both illegal and harmful, butelimination of the above-styled courses must figure moreprominently in our drug war. We'll save both children andmoney.   Charles M. Richardson   Educational Engineering   Huntington Station, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
