The Justice Department said North's attempt near the end of thetrial to subpoena the records was calculated to ``graymail theUnited States'' by threatening disclosure of secrets to forcedismissal of the charges.   ``This is a last-ditch effort to use classified information as aweapon rather than as proof,'' said the department, which alsofiled under court seal an affidavit by Mary C. Lawton, counsel forintelligence policy.   ``The information sought receives the highest protection underthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the harm to nationalsecurity of disclosure of this information would be enormous,'' thedepartment said in papers filed by Assistant Attorney GeneralEdward S.G. Dennis Jr., head of the criminal division.   As an alternative to furnishing records of the surveillances,the department proposed a stipulation of facts about eavesdroppingby intelligence agencies approved by the secret ForeignIntelligence Surveillance Court.   The stipulation document included an indication that Iranianarms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar was among those who were theobject of surveillances conducted in Washington by unnamedintelligence agencies.   The Justice Department said surveillances were conducted betweenOct. 1985 and September 1986 of several foreigners _ none named _at the request of then-CIA Director William Casey.   Included were ``several foreign nationals who purported to be,or have direct access to, representatives of the government ofIran,'' according to the proposed stipulation.   ``The surveillances related to negotiations concerning therelease of American hostages in Lebanon,'' the document said.   On Oct. 7, 1985, the department, with the authorization ofthen-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, sought court approval forsurveillance of two foreigners, the document said.   The next day, North met in Washington with Ghorbanifar as wellas Israeli arms dealers Al Schwimmer and Yaacov Nimrodi, accordingto the report of the presidential commission headed by former Sen.John Tower.   Another surveillance of ``one of the same two individuals'' wasapproved on April 2, 1986.   On the next day, North and CIA consultant George Cave met inWashington with Ghorbanifar, according to the Tower report.   The meetings, which continued April 4, 1986, involveddiscussions about the forthcoming mission to Tehran led by Northand former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.   The Justice Department document also detailed another round ofsurveillances approved by Meese in September 1986.   These surveillances coincided with meetings North and Cave hadin Washington with representatives of an Iranian group thatreportedly included the son of Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker ofIran's parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
