If seniority were the only key, Prime Minister Margaret Thatchermight certainly be voted most likely to assume the summitleadership. But she is clearly aware that taking the job requiresmore economic wherewithal than her country has.   The United States ``is the largest most prosperous nation in theworld, and let's be thankful she has taken a leadership role,'' thethree-term British leader said in a March radio interview. ``Noneof us can substitute for it. We could all help with it.''   French President Francois Mitterrand, the host of the 1989economic conclave, has not shown any inclination to don the mantleof world leadership. His country is not even a member of NATO'smilitary structure, although it does participate in the alliance'spolitical bodies, and his left-leaning economic policies are atodds with those of the other allies.   Japan, fast overtaking the U.S. economy in many ways, cannotassume leadership of the summit seven; its markets are virtuallyclosed to the outside world, its ability to expand militarily islimited by constitutional restraints and it is not a member of theNATO alliance to which the other summit countries belong.   ``There is no evidence of any country in the world anxious toreplace us in our leadership position,'' said PenelopeHartland-Thunberg, an international affairs scholar at the Centerfor Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``The costand responsibility of leadership is something they wish to avoid.''   Still, the economic decline that has turned the United Statesfrom the world's biggest creditor in 1982 to its biggest debtor in1988 has left a leadership vacuum begging to be filled.   Even at this, his final summit, Reagan was unable to sway hispartners on his agenda priority _ the elimination of allagriculture subsidies by the end of the century.   The summitteers are hoping Reagan's successor can turn thingsaround.   But the stakes are high, and many of the summit leaders wouldprefer that Reagan be replaced with a known quantity like GeorgeBush, his vice president who has pledged to carry on thepresident's program, said Simon Serfaty, an academic at the Schoolof Advanced International Studies of John Hopkins University inWashington.   This was underlined by the newest member of the summit club,Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita, who emphasized to the otherleaders the importance of continuity in U.S. policy.   ``Obviously, the current policy has been so successful, we wantto ensure it goes on,'' said an Italian official, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Some of the other leaders feel a Republican like Bush also wouldbe more likely to maintain the free market policies that led to asurge of prosperity in the summit countries during the Reaganadministration, said Serfaty.   But the other presidential hopeful, Michael Dukakis, alsoappears to be an economic moderate. In a broad-ranging foreignpolicy speech recently, Dukakis stressed the importance ofcooperating with America's allies.   Regardless of who wins the November election, Reagan has leftfor his successor little maneuvering room, given the U.S.indebtedness that resulted from his economic policies of deep taxcuts and enormous military buildup.   The heavy debt to Japan and other summit countries, growingforeign investment and bulging budget and trade deficits virtuallyensure the continued closeness that has characterized the club inthe Reagan years.   ``Reagan leaves a difficult legacy,'' Serfaty said.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Ruth Sinai, who specializes in foreign affairsfor The Associated Press, covered the Toronto summit.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 26</NOTE></DOC>
