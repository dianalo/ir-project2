Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and central bank governor Francisco Gros spent two days here conferring with an array of U.S. and international officials, including U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, World Bank President Barber Conable and Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. It was the first visit here by top Brazilian economic officials since the country suspended interest payments on its commercial bank debt two weeks ago.    Although the Brazilians won a sympathetic hearing, both U.S. and Brazilian officials acknowledged that the message from all quarters was the same: Additional money will be available, but Brazil first must take serious steps to put its economy back in order.    U.S. officials &quot;understand&quot; the Brazilian position, &quot;but they don't like it,&quot; Mr. Funaro acknowledged after the series of meetings here Friday and Saturday.    The chilly reception is expected to intensify pressure on Brasilia to speed up its efforts to draft a new program to deal with Brazil's economic ills. Since November, the country has been without a coherent economic plan to control inflation or a slumping trade performance.    U.S. officials say Brazil's current troubles stem mainly from the failure of the government of President Jose Sarney to tighten its economic program before consumer spending and wage increases got out of line. Brazil has been running a trade surplus of $10 billion to $12 billion over the past two years and has had an 8% economic-growth rate, one of the highest in the world.    In an indication over the weekend that government talk of a rigorous austerity program to control inflation may not be translated quickly into action, President Sarney authorized a 42% rise in Brazil's minimum monthly wage. The increase, which boosts wages to the equivalent of $70.10 from $49.40, affects about 16 million workers. It is intended to cover inflation since the most-recent increase on Jan. 1. But if inflation in February is as low as 12%, as Mr. Funaro has predicted, workers will receive an inflation-adjusted increase of 6.5%.    The increase confirms the return of the Brazilian economy to full indexation after the collapse of the Cruzado anti-inflation plan. Since that program was launched a year ago, workers receiving the minimum salary have been given pay rises totaling 70%, all during the past two months.    Mr. Funaro indicated over the weekend that Brazilian policy makers wanted to wait for the latest explosion of inflation to abate. &quot;We have to leave two or three months for prices to find their place,&quot; he said. &quot;If inflation remains, then we have to do something.&quot;    Despite Brazil's suspension of interest payments, both the U.S. and other creditor governments appear insistent that the country move to grapple with its domestic problems.    U.S. officials say the Reagan administration already provided substantial help when it persuaded creditor governments earlier this year to reschedule about $4.1 billion of Brazilian debt without the usual requirement that a debtor country first negotiate an accord with the IMF. Brazil contends that signing a pact with the IMF would be anathema at home.    Messrs. Funaro and Gros traveled to Europe yesterday for two days of meetings with their counterparts in Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland. But Western officials indicated the reception in those capitals was likely to be the same as in Washington. Monetary officials say Brazil can easily win approval of several billion dollars in loans from the World Bank provided it takes steps to put its economy in order.    It isn't clear yet what specific new concessions Brazil is seeking from its creditors. Brasilia contends the debt problem now demands a &quot;political&quot; solution because commercial banks seem unwilling to provide new money.    Mr. Funaro said over the weekend that Brazil wants to revamp the current system to guarantee that debtor countries will be able to borrow specific amounts from governments and international lending organizations for the next several years without having to rely on commercial banks. He said the Baker Plan, proposed by Treasury Secretary James Baker in 1985 partly to encourage more lending by commercial banks, failed to spur more bank lending. That plan also called for major economypolicy changes by debtor countries.    The weekend discussions reflect a growing split between Brazil and the U.S. over how to handle Brasilia's latest cash squeeze. Brazil contends it has taken all the steps that are necessary but has been overwhelmed by the need to amass a large trade surplus and keep up its debt repayments.    Mr. Funaro maintained a low key after his conferences here. He stressed that Brazil wasn't trying to provoke a major confrontation with its creditors. And Brazilian officials said privately they were not trying to persuade other Latin governments to join in any sort of debtors' cartel.    Separately, the central bank sent a telex to foreign creditor banks aimed at cooling the hostile reaction to its earlier declaration that banks cutting short-term credit lines to Brazil would not be repaid their debts. The telex, signed by Mr. Gros, the central bank governor, appeared conciliatory more in tone than in substance. It said the measure would &quot;only be maintained for the period considered absolutely essential.&quot; It added that any credits above those already open to Brazilian banks abroad would not be subject to the repayment suspension.    In an earlier telex that provoked surprise and anger among foreign banks, Brazil said banks cutting short-term trade and interbank credit lines to the country's banks abroad would not be repaid. Instead, the money would be deposited in accounts of the central bank outside Brazil.    Mr. Gros said the latest telex was an effort to &quot;clarify&quot; the situation. &quot;It was not at all an attempt to freeze the (short-term credit) lines,&quot; he said.    ---   Also contributing to this article was Roger Cohen in Rio de Janeiro. </TEXT></DOC>
