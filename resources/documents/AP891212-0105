Gorbachev and the Soviet Parliament onTuesday rejected reformers' efforts to revoke the Communist Party'smonopoly on power and push the nation along the road to multipartydemocracy taken by Moscow's allies.   But as the Congress of People's Deputies began its wintersession in the Kremlin, hundreds of parliamentarians supporteddebate on altering the party's legal status, indicating the idea isgaining popularity as reforms shake the Soviet Baltic and EasternEurope.   The Congress, the 2,250-member Parliament that is theoreticallythe nation's highest political body, gave Gorbachev the agenda hewanted for its 10-day session. Gorbachev urged them to focus on theeconomy.   ``We need drastic reforms,'' the Soviet president. ``So far,there are no improvements in this area.''   ``The key question of the agenda is righting the economy, thestages of economic reform and our approach to the next five-yearplan,'' Gorbachev said. He said the country needed ``as neverbefore,'' discipline and responsibility.   In other East bloc developments Tuesday:   _ Thousands of Bulgarians rallied in Sofia outside a CommunistParty Central Committee meeting to make sure the Communists keeptheir promises of reforms _ including free elections and an end tothe party's monopoly on power. An official said the party lacksenough talented people to promote its doctrine and manage theeconomy.   _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III met in Potsdam with EastGerman Premier Hans Modrow and told him of U.S. support for thereforms taking place there. East Germany's Communist Partynewspaper conceded that a botched brand of socialism has degradedliving conditions, but said those times are past and a new``democratic socialism'' is in the making.   _ Czechoslovakia's ousted Communist hard-liners lost their lastpositions of power as Parliament formally accepted theirresignations. The battle for president heated up between playwrightVaclav Havel and Alexander Dubcek, 67, the leader of the 1968``Prague Spring'' reforms.   _ Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Poland's government shouldbe granted special economic powers allowing it to restructure theeconomy without the approval of Parliament.   The Soviet deputies met in the Kremlin Palace of Congressesbefore a giant statue of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin.Gorbachev pressed the deputies toward a more organized approach totheir session than the nationally televised free-for-all in May andJune.   Only the first few hours were televised live, with the restshown on tape Tuesday evening. However, deputies voted later not toallow Soviet TV to air any debates on ethnic issues after speakerstouched on the explosive conflict between Armenians andAzerbaijanis that has led to an estimated 200 deaths and hundredsof thousands of refugees in the last two years.   Despite Gorbachev's plea for urgent action on the economy, along debate over procedural matters threw the Congress behindschedule, delaying Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's economic report.That report apparently will be based on a long-term plan developedby his deputy, Leonid Abalkin, that includes making the rubleconvertible, selling off unprofitable state enterprises anddeveloping a stock market.   In the first major test only 2{ hours after the session began,the Congress rejected a bid by Baltic deputies and members of thereformist Inter-Regional Deputies Group to debate Article 6 of theSoviet Constitution that proclaims the Communist Party ``theleading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of itspolitical system.''   The vote was 1,139 to 839. Fifty-six deputies abstained. It camea day after human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov's call for ageneral strike to press for elimination of Article 6 fizzled.   Poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko told the deputies: ``Authority must notbe only written into one paragraph, but proven every day.'' Hecalled the vote total a ``noble defeat'' because 87 percent of thedeputies are Communist Party members.   Vilen Tolpezhnikov, a deputy from Latvia, argued that the partyis used to usurping power. Tolpezhnikov, a member of a committeeinvestigating the military assault on demonstrators in Tbilisi,Georgia, in April, said the decision to use force was made at ameeting in the party Central Committee. ``There were no specialdecrees, nobody was taking notes in the course of the conference,''he said.   But he alleged that as a result of the conference, DefenseMinister Dmitri T. Yazov gave the order to use force.Shovel-wielding soldiers killed 19 civilians.   Lithuania last week became the first of the 15 Soviet republicsto abolish the Communist Party's leading role, rewriting itsConstitution to allow a multiparty system.   Gorbachev's reforms have pushed the Soviet Union's EasternEuropean allies toward radical changes that have ended thecommunist monopoly on power. Hungary, East Germany andCzechoslovakia have removed such language from their constitutions,and Poland has a non-communist goverment. The Bulgarian leadershiphas proposed a multiparty system.   Soviet Communist Party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev saidSaturday that the party would not maintain its monopoly on power``at any cost.'' But Gorbachev criticized Sakharov's strike call asan effort ``at belittling the party, or of undermining its prestigeamong the working people.''   He called for a sober debate of Article 6. ``We cannot startpolitical speculation. And that's it,'' he said.   Gorbachev also engaged in an angry exchange with Sakharov, whoproposed the Congress debate not only the party's monopoly onpolitical power but ``all the articles hindering the passing oflaws on land, property and other bills promoting perestroika.''   The law on land would allow farmers to pass down to theirchildren their rights on state-owned land. The law on propertywould widen ownership rights, but stops short of allowing privateproperty. Both are considered major pieces of reform legislationthat will break the top-down control of the economy. They weredebated by the Supreme Soviet _ the standing legislature that iselected by the Congress _ at its fall session and published forpublic debate.   Gorbachev told Sakharov, ``I am under the impression thatneither you nor we will know how to realize your suggestion. Who isto define what articles to exclude?''   Sakharov then turned to Gorbachev and handed him a stack oftelegrams in support of his position.   ``You come to me, I will give you three files of telegrams,''Gorbachev retorted.   When he began to speak about Article 6, Gorbachev cut him shortand with a curt, ``Thank you.''   Nevertheless, Gorbachev brought Sakharov's proposal up for avote. It was defeated 1,415 to 477. A separate proposal tospecifically debate the laws on land and property was defeated1,387 to 537.</TEXT></DOC>
