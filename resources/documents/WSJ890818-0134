The Congress was set up in the 1950s by intellectuals, mainly of the left, to do battle with Stalinism. Mr. Coleman, who was an early supporter of the organization, edited the Australian literary and political review the Quadrant, a sister to Preuves, Tempo Presente, Encounter and the other reviews created by the Congress. Just how the Congress was formed, why it was valued and how it was funded are matters directly addressed and forthrightly discussed in Mr. Coleman's always interesting book.    Operating on an international scale, the Congress's forums and publications attracted a wide array of intellectuals, among them Arthur Koestler, Ignazio Silone, Sidney Hook, Dwight MacDonald, Raymond Aron and Irving Kristol, who edited Encounter with Stephen Spender. Many of them did not know that the Congress had been secretly financed from the start by the CIA. When these ties were revealed in the mid-1960s, the Congress was kicked about by left and right until it was finally dissolved in 1967. &quot;Cockroaches in a slum sink&quot; -- Norman Mailer's view of the Congress's intellectuals -- suggests the level of the discourse.    It is Mr. Coleman's belief that the publications sponsored by the Congress were most useful in the struggle against communist totalitarianism, which seemed irresistible after the Soviet victory in World War II. Is this judgment valid? Did the reviews put out by the Congress contribute in any serious way to the victory of the democracies over the Soviet Union in the cold war? (Since Mr. Gorbachev's indictment of his country's Stalinist past, this victory has now been conceded by leftists of almost every shade of red.) And this second question has to be put: Was it necessary to deceive people like Messrs. MacDonald and Spender, or Nicola Chiaromonte, to make use of their literary skills in the struggle against Stalinism?    Let me answer this second question first. I do not think it would have been possible to set up literary-political reviews under capable and, in point of fact, superior editors -- Encounter was for a period the best English literary review since T.S. Eliot's Criterion -- while fully informing the editors chosen that the CIA was footing the bill. So most of those chosen to undeceive their readers about Stalinism had to be deceived themselves.    And now to the first question: Was the deception justified in view of its political results? I think I have to answer: It was not. I do not believe Preuves, the French review set up by the Congress, had the slightest effect on the intellectual community of Paris, which until the middle '70s remained solidly behind Sartre's pro-communist Les Temps Modernes. I was in Rome in 1965, and it was clear to me then that Nicola Chiaromonte's Tempo Presente, a first-rate review intellectually, had failed to influence Italian intellectual life to any important degree.    I can suggest one possible justification for the Congress's publications. If they did not win new adherents to democratic values, perhaps they helped keep those already committed to such values from giving up.    But there is more to &quot;The Liberal Conspiracy&quot; than just the story of Congress and its funding. Much interesting gossip can be found in these pages. Now, is gossip valuable? In most instances I would say it is not, but what is gossiped about here is intellectual opinion, and the intellectual opinions of yester-year may help us against crediting too readily those of the moment. It is always useful to note that the views of political theorists change with the passing of time.    For instance, Mr. Coleman reports that in 1951, Mr. Aron observed in a piece of his that for intellectuals &quot;anti-capitalism is an article of faith.&quot; Mr. Aron then went on to say that for them to even debate the merits of the free enterprise system would be an emotional and philosophical surrender.    Let me contrast this view of how intellectuals judged capitalism then, with the recent judgment of it by the late and respected Michael Harrington (a Trotskyist communist during the '50s). In his recent book, &quot;Socialism Past and Future,&quot; Mr. Harrington wrote: &quot;Capitalism was the greatest achievement of humankind in history, a culture and a civilization as well as an economy.&quot;    To be sure, I have gone outside Mr. Coleman's text to contrast a right-wing intellectual's view of the left during the '50s with a left-wing intellectual's view of the direction of the right today. But within Mr. Coleman's text, the readers will find many similar asymmetries of statement. For example, we read of Daniel Bell, lately leaning leftward, defending Western civilization against a leftist critique of William Phillips, now accused of political respectability. And there are statements by Mr. MacDonald, Mary McCarthy and Norman Birnbaum that are just as entertainingly odd.    ---   Mr. Abel is a writer who lives in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
