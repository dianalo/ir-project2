The Department has now completed the administrativereview in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended(``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(``HTS''), as provided for in section 1201 et. seq. of the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classifiedsolely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s).Imports covered by this review are shipments of replacement parts for self-propelledbituminous paving equipment, excluding attachments and parts for attachmentsfrom Canada. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiableunder items 652.1540, 652.1825, 652.3530, 678.5097, 680.2500, 680.3300,685.9026, 685.9500, 686.8040, 688.1800, 712.4900, and 773.2500 of the TariffSchedules of the United States Annotated. This merchandise is currentlyclassifiable under HTS items 4016.93.10, 7315.11.00, 7315.89.50, 7315.90.00,8336.50.00, 8479.99.00, 8481.20.00, 8482.10.10, 8483.90.90, 8539.29.20,8544.20.00, 8544.41.00, 8544.51.80, 8544.60.20, 9015.30.40. The HTS itemnumbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The writtendescription remains dispositive.The review covers two exporters of this merchandise to the United States,Fortress Allatt Ltd. (``Fortress'') and General Construction Co. Inc. (``General''),and the period September 1, 1986 through August 31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. Wereceived written comments from the petitioner, Blaw Knox, and from onerespondent Fortress Allatt Ltd. (``Fortress''). We also received rebuttalcomments from Fortress.<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Blaw Knox alleges that the Department failed to deductall duties from the U.S. price because of a clerical error in which thelowest duty rate of three possible rates was always deducted.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have recalculated the resultsaccordingly.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>The petitioner asserts that Fortress's pre-sale warehousingcosts on its exporter's sale price (ESP) sales to the United States shouldbe treated as direct expenses as in the decision of the Court of InternationalTrade in <T3>Asahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. </T3>v. <T3>U.S.</T3>, (Slip Op 88-100, July 25, 1988) because they bear a directrelationship to the sales under consideration.Fortress, in rebuttal comments, argues that ITA is acting within its authorityin treating pre-sale warehousing as an indirect expense on ESP sales asit has consistently done since 1979.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree with Fortress. There is a no evidenceon the record of a direct relationship between pre-sale warehouse expensesand the specific sales under review. Therefore, we have treated Fortress'spre-sale warehouse expenses as direct expenses.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> The petitioners alleges that the Department erred bypresuming full pass-through of taxes not collected by reason of exportationof the merchandise to the United States on sales to end users. No tax wasdue on sales to distributors in Canada or on exports to the United States,but only on sales to end-users in Canada. Petitioner cites Fortress's responsewhich states that no discounts are granted to end-users in either country,while discounts of 5 to 25 percent are granted on sales to distributorsand argues that the 12.1 percent Canadian Federal Sales Tax is not alwaysfully passed through to end users in Canada, in light of the differencein prices between sales to Canadian distributors and Canadian end-users.Fortress, in rebuttal, claims that there is no relationship between theamount of the sales tax and the amount of the discount granted to distributors.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree with the petitioner. The Departmentinterprets the language of section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to allow forthe addition of the full tax amount to the U.S. price when there is noindication that a manufacturer did not add the tax to the home market price.The statute does not require a measurement of the incidence of consumptiontaxes not collected by reason of exportation to the United States, andthere is no evidence in the record to indicate that Fortress did not addthe entire amount of the tax to home market price. For a more detaileddiscussion of Commerce's interpretation of section 772(d)(1)(C), see theDepartment's brief, dated April 25, 1988, in <T3>Zenith Electronic Corp. et al. </T3>v.<T3> United States,</T3> CAFC Appeal Nos. 88-1259 and 88-1260.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>The petitioner believes that Fortress's claimed warrantyexpenses should be rejected because the amount of warranty in Canada wasmuch greater than the amount in the United States and that in the absenceof verification, the warranty costs reported are clearly suspect and mustbe rejected. Blaw Knox argues that a far more reasonable assumption isthat warranty costs in the two markets are approximately equal.Fortress, in rebuttal comments, notes that reported the actual amountsof warranty expenses and would welcome a verification of them.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We found no basis to reject respondent'swarranty claim.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> The petitioner alleges that the Department erred bymaking an inland freight adjustment for Fortress's home market sales sincethe terms are f.o.b. Downsview. On ESP transactions to the United States,petitioner questions the Department's adjustment to the price for freightto the customer, because terms of the sale are f.o.b. Fortress' warehouse.In rebuttal comments Fortress states that it occasionally agrees to payfreight in the home market even though the terms of sale are f.o.b. Downsviewand that this was verified in a prior review. In previous reviews, theDepartment permitted the total freight costs in the home market to be allocatedover all sales because the large number of sales made it impractical toallocate the freight costs to sales of individual parts, so this approachis not unreasonable in this review.Fortress also notes that Blaw Knox is confused about the freight cost incurredon ESP sales. Those sales are f.o.b. U.S. warehouse so Fortress absorbsthe freight costs of shipping to those warehouses, not to the customeras stated by Blaw Knox.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We have continued to adjust both home marketand ESP prices for inland freight as this expense is incurred by Fortressin bringing the merchandise to the customer. We find the respondent's methodologyin allocating these expenses to apprpriate sales reasonable.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> In the disclosure example, the petitioner notes thatthe constructed value derived as a starting foreign market value differsfrom the constructed value used in the Department's margin calculations.Fortress in rebuttal comments notes that the constructed value shown inthe example was before adjustments. The Department made adjustments, whereapplicable, to all foreign market values for discounts, warranty expense,credit expense, and commissions to unrelated parties. When making comparisonswith ESP sales the Department deducted indirect selling expenses to offsetthe deduction of selling expenses on U.S. sales. When these adjustmentsare taken into account, there is no discrepancy.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Fortress is correct. The foreign marketvalue disclosed as a starting foreign market value was before adjustments,whereas the constructed value used in the margin calculation was afterthe appropriate adjustments had been made.<T3>Comment 7:</T3> Fortress notes that the Department should exclude fromthe final results any sales of parts for Fortress Allatt machines or attachments,pursuant to its request that such parts be excluded from the scope of thefinding.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree in part. The Department ruledon January 19, 1989 that replacement parts for Fortress machines are subjectto the finding but that replacement parts for attachments are not subjectto the finding.<T3>Comment 8:</T3> Fortress contends that the Department calculated creditexpense differently for sales to the United States than it did for homemarket sales. For U.S. sales, the Department calculated the expense bymultiplying the credit factor (average number of days times average shortterm interest rate) times the ``starting price''<ITAG tagnum="54">less discount, if any, while the home market credit expense was calculatedby multiplying the credit factor times starting price less discount, ifany, and less freight, warranty and commission. Fortess notes that theDepartment should calculate the credit expense on the same basis in bothmarkets.</ITAG><T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree and have recalculated the creditexpense using the starting price less discount only for both markets.<T3>Comment 9:</T3> Fortress contends that a portion of the freight coston ESP sales from the California and Georgia warehouses was double-counted.The total freight cost from Downsview (not Buffalo) to California or Georgiawas deducted as well as a factor for the freight from Downsview to Buffalo,in effect double-counting the Downsview Buffalo portion. Because the partsare shipped directly from Downsview for these sales, the Department shouldnot make an additional deduction for freight from Downsview to Buffalo.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have recalculated the resultsaccordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of the Review</ITAG>As a result of the comments received and correction of clerical errors,we have revised our preliminary results for Fortress Allatt Ltd. and GeneralConstruction Co. Inc., and we determine that the following weighted-averagemargins exist for the period September 1, 1986 through August 31, 1987:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,6</C> <H1>Manufacturer/Exporter </H1><H1>Margin (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Fortress Allatt Ltd. <D>1.31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">General Construction <D>1.31</D></ITAG></ITAG>The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between UnitedStates price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages statedabove. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly tothe Customs Service.Further, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, a cashdeposit of estimated antidumping duties based on the above margins shallbe required for these firms.For any future entries of this merchandise from a new exporter not coveredin this or prior administrative reviews, whose first shipments occurredafter August 31, 1987 and who is unrelated to any reviewed firm, or anypreviously reviewed firm, a cash deposit of 1.31 percent shall be required.These deposit requirements are effective for all shipments of Canadianreplacement parts for self-propelled paving equipment entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication ofthe final results of this administrative review.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and andSection; 353.53a of the CommerceRegulations (19 CFR 353.53a).<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
