The overseas practices were among 10 alleged irregularities that Joseph W. O'Donnell, former chairman and chief executive of JWT's flagship J. Walter Thompson Co. unit, presented to JWT's board just before he was dismissed last January. Mr. O'Donnell and JWT have declined to make the allegations public, but they have been the subject of considerable speculation on Wall Street and in the advertising industry.    As previously reported, Mr. O'Donnell was dismissed after presenting the JWT board with a buyout proposal from an outside group of investors. At the time, he also told the board he had uncovered financial irregularities at J. Walter Thompson since being named to head the unit in March 1986.    JWT, an advertising, market research and public relations company, is the target of a takeover bid by WPP Group PLC, a British marketing services concern. Martin S. Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, said he knows &quot;nothing about the specific charges&quot; of alleged financial irregularities at JWT, but said his outside auditors, Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., would have to look at JWT's books as part of any merger.    Terence Martin, JWT's chief financial officer, declined to comment specifically on the questions raised by Mr. O'Donnell. Mr. Martin would say only that the alleged problems didn't &quot;in any significant way affect JWT&quot; and were handled by JWT &quot;in the normal course of business.&quot;    In March, Price Waterhouse, JWT's longtime auditors, reported to the board and its audit committee -- headed by Gordon T. Wallis, former chairman of Irving Bank Corp., a JWT client -- that the problems listed by Mr. O'Donnell weren't material and were being cleaned up.    But according to one executive present at the meeting when Mr. O'Donnell discussed the alleged irregularities, Mr. O'Donnell said that &quot;any one of the 10 may be explainable, but collectively, they reveal a disturbing management pattern.&quot;    In an interview, Mr. O'Donnell, who currently is chief executive of William Esty andamp; Co., an advertising unit of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC, characterized JWT's financial management as &quot;very loose,&quot; but he declined to elaborate.    Among other things, Mr. O'Donnell is said to have told the board that he learned some employees in the Belgian office were partly paid with expense vouchers to help them avoid local taxes.    According to former JWT executives, JWT apparently has been negotiating a settlement of as much as $1.2 million with the Belgian government to settle for underpayment of taxes by JWT employees.    In Belgium, an official of the government said it has asked for added tax payments from JWT units there and has conducted an investigation of taxes paid by JWT employees.    The former JWT executives said that some employees were paid with expense account vouchers called &quot;S&quot; accounts instead of regular wages to avoid the high Belgian tax rate on individuals, which can run as high as 70%. Similar techniques were apparently used in some other foreign countries, the former executives said.    According to the former JWT executives, Mr. O'Donnell also told the board that the company used another technique in Belgium to help its employees avoid taxes. This method is said to have involved the collection of &quot;bonuses&quot; by JWT executives from a vendor outside Belgium. The vendor supplied the &quot;bonuses&quot; by separately billing JWT, Mr. O'Donnell is said to have charged.    Former executives say another incident brought to the board's attention by Mr. O'Donnell involved JWT's purchase of a Turkish ad agency in 1984. Mr. O'Donnell is said to have told the board that JWT paid a significant portion of the purchase price to a Swiss bank account belonging to the agency's owners, allowing them to avoid some Turkish taxes.    JWT's Mr. Martin declined to comment on the charges related to Belgium and Turkey.    In the past, JWT has been rocked by problems involving alleged financial irregularities. In 1982, the company disclosed it would have to take a $30 million write-off because of financial irregularities in its television-syndication unit. JWT publicly blamed the scandal on Marie Luisi, who headed the unit. Mrs. Luisi, who was dismissed, subsequently sued the company for damage to her reputation. The case is still pending in New York state court. </TEXT></DOC>
