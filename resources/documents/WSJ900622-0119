He even brought in a language specialist who hascollected gems of bureaucratese: a traffic light is an&quot;electronically adjusted, color-coded, vehicular flow-controlmechanism&quot;; a parachute is an &quot;individual aerial decelerationmechanism&quot;; a shovel is a &quot;combat emplacement evacuator&quot;;waves are &quot;sea-air interface climactic disturbances.&quot; We ofcourse wish Sec. Derwinski luck, but we're intrigued by thebureaucrats' amazing, almost incredible skill to conceal thereal meaning of simple nouns. As the saying goes, someoneshould bottle it. A real entrenpreneur would find a way toput this stuff in a box and sell it as a $25 party gameguaranteed to provide hours of puzzlement, laughter andshrieks of disbelief.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
