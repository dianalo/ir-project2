Keating Jr.'scriminal trial dealt a setback to prosecutors, ruling thatthe former chairman of American Continental Corp. can't beconvicted unless the government proves that he was aware ofspecific instances of securities fraud by his employees.   Los Angeles County prosecutors, in pretrial motions, hadasked Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito to adopt a broadertheory of criminal liability: that the head of a company canbe accountable for wrongful acts he didn't know about.</LP><TEXT>   Many securities lawyers criticized the prosecution'sproposed theory as too sweeping an interpretation ofCalifornia law, but the doctrine was endorsed by the NorthAmerican Securities Administrators Association and otherlawyers.   Stephen C. Neal, Mr. Keating's lawyer, said he was&quot;satisfied&quot; with the judge's ruling, which was reflected injury instructions that will be delivered at the close of thetrial. Prosecutors couldn't be reached for comment after theruling yesterday. The trial is expected to last at least sixmonths.   Mr. Keating faces 20 counts of securities fraud inconnection with the sale of American Continental subordinateddebentures at branches of the company's former LincolnSavings andamp; Loan Association unit. The thrift was seized byfederal regulators in April 1989, a day after AmericanContinental filed for federal bankruptcy-law protection.   The Phoenix, Ariz., businessman is also defending amassive civil lawsuit by American Continental bondholders whoallege that they lost $250 million. Separately yesterday, alawyer for the bondholders said that Michael Milken, theimprisoned junk-bond king, had agreed to give sworn testimonyin the civil case about his dealings with Mr. Keating.</TEXT></DOC>
