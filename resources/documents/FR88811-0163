A major resultof these changes is that we would discontinue 75 and 90 percent fundingfor eligibility determination systems because they do not meet the definitionof core subsystems of ``mechanized claims processing and information retrievalsystem.'' We would delete the definition of ``enhancement,'' as we proposeto discontinue 75 percent funding for enhancements except those requiredby HCFA.We would also conform our regulations to changes made by sections 9503(b)(2)and 9518 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)of 1985 (Pub.

Background</ITAG>Basis of the SystemA Medicaid management information system (commonly known as the MMIS) isa mechanized system (``system'') of claims processing and information retrievalused in State Medicaid programs under title XIX of the Social SecurityAct (the Act). The system, originally authorized by section 1903(a)(3)of the Act, is used to process Medicaid claims and to retrieve and produceutilization data and management information about medical care and servicesfurnished to recipients. Each State (with some exceptions) is requiredby section 1903(r) of the Act to have in place an operational and approvedsystem or be subject to reductions of Federal financial participation (FFP).Section 1903(a)(3) of the Act authorizes FFP at 90 percent of the sumsa State Medicaid agency expends for the design, development, or installationof a mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system thatthe Secretary determines is likely to provide more efficient, economicaland effective administration of the program and at 75 percent for the operationof these systems. (Hereafter, we will refer to 90 percent and 75 percentFFP as ``enhanced'' FFP since it is greater than the 50 percent FFP authorizedfor most Medicaid administrative expenses.)Current RegulationsOur regulations concerning mechanized claims processing and informationretrieval systems are at 42 CFR Part 433, Subpart C. Section 433.111 liststerms used in obtaining initial approval or making changes to the system;the terms are defined at 45 CFR 95.605. A State agency's system must complywith the requirements in andSection; 433.112 through andSection; 433.122, beforethe agency may obtain enhanced funding. These sections discuss the availabilityof enhanced FFP, identify the conditions a system must meet for approvalor reapproval and specify that an agency must meet HCFA-determined systemrequirements and performance standards if it is to continue to receiveenhanced funding. Section 433.123 describes procedures we follow to ensurethat we inform interested parties adequately before we make changes inconditions of approval or reapproval and in system requirements for systemseligible for enhanced funding.The general HHS requirements for approval of advanced planning documents(APDs) are found at 45 CFR Part 95, Subpart F, which prescribe the conditionsunder which HHS will approve FFP at applicable rates for costs of automaticdata processing for the Medicaid program and for the Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC) and the Child Support Enforcement program (titlesIV-A and IV-D respectively). On December 18, 1986, HHS amended 45 CFR Part95, Subpart F to simplify and make those regulations consistent, to themaximum extent possible, with regulations governing availability of FFPat the enhanced matching rate for computerized systems that support programsunder titles IV-A, IV-D and XIX (51 FR 45321). At the same time, HHS revised42 CFR 433.111 by removing the content of the definitions of all the termsfound there previously (except that of ``mechanized claims processing andinformation retrieval system'') and cross-referring the reader to 45 CFR95.605 for definitions of the other terms. The term ``improvement'' wasreplaced by ``enhancement'' in andSection;andSection; 433.111 and 433.112.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Proposed Changes to Regulations</ITAG>Under current policy based on HCFA regulations at andSection; 433.112 andat 45 CFR Part 95, Subpart F, we pay 90 percent FFP for the design, development,installation or enhancement of a mechanized claims processing and informationretrieval system based on an APD approved by HCFA. Under the proposed rulewe would approve an APD as being likely to provide more efficient, economicaland effective administration of the State plan only for a mechanized claimsprocessing and information retrieval system that consists of the required,or core, subsystems of that system, which we describe in Part 11 of theState Medicaid Manual. There are currently six required core subsystems:The Recipient, Provider, Claims Processing, Reference File, Surveillanceand Utilization Review, and the Management and Administrative Reportingsubsystems.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. ``Mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system''</ITAG>We propose to revise the current definition of ``mechanized claims processingand information retrieval system'' in 42 CFR 433.111 so that it consistsof the HCRA-required, or core, subsystems specified in the State MedicaidManual. If a State were to initiate changes to its system as likely toprovide more efficient, economical and effective administration of theState plan and HCFA approved them, the changes would be funded at the regularmatching rate of 50 percent in accordance with andSection; 433.15(b)(7) and45 CFR Part 95, Subpart F.Under the revised definition, ``mechanized claims processing and informationretrieval system'' would be the six Statewide core subsystems of softwareand hardware used (1) to process claims by providers of medical care andservices for items and services furnished to eligible recipients underthe Medicaid program and (2) to retrieve and produce service utilizationand management information that is required by the Medicaid single Stateagency and Federal government for Medicaid program administration and auditpurposes. The system would be used to process claims only for items andservices covered under the State plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Enhancements</ITAG>We also propose to delete the term ``enhancement'' found in andSection; 433.111.Neither the term ``enhancement'' nor ``improvement'', as enhancement wasformerly called, appears in the statute. Under our proposal, we would fundonly HCFA-approved core systems and subsystems and HCFA-required changesat the enhanced funding rates. Conversely, any modification suggested bya State that is not approved by HCFA as a core system requirement wouldnot be viewed by HCFA as an ``improvement'' for purposes of enhanced FFP.Under this proposal, the only changes for which we would allow 75 or 90percent funding are HCFA-required changes to the required core system orsubsystems. Any other system design and development changes that are approvedwould be funded at the regular 50 percent matching rate. (Although HHSdefines ``enhancements'' for Medicaid in 45 CFR 95.605, the definitiondoes not require Medicaid to pay for enhancements. It merely makes consistentthe definition and term from program to program.)Congress added section 1903(a)(3) of the Act to authorize enhanced FFPfor mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems thatthe Secretary determines are likely to provide more efficient, economicaland effective administration of the State plan. Congress expected the savingsfrom improved administrative efficiency to more than offset the cost ofimplementing the provision. (H.R. Rep. No. 92-231, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess.103-104 (1971))Once these proposed regulations are made final, we would not provide enhancedFFP for any system or subsystem that does not meet the above definitionof mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system. Therefore,under andSection; 433.112, we would approve 90 percent FFP only when therequirements published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and in Part 11 of the State Medicaid Manual forthe system being designed, developed, or installed are met. Approval ofa system for 75 percent FFP for operation would continue to depend on thatsystem meeting the published requirements as required by andSection; 433.116.We reaffirm our policy that 75 percent FFP is available only for costsdirectly attributable to approved systems.The purpose of the proposed amendment is to avoid the waste of effort expendedin preparing an APD or procurement for which we would disapprove enhancedFFP. Currently, we receive APDs for system projects and procurements thatwe would not fund (at an enhanced rate) under the proposed change, suchas eligibility determination systems or State-initiated changes.3. We also propose to revise andSection; 433.112(a) to read as it did fromJuly 30, 1985 to December 18, 1986, except that it would not include theterm ``improvement''. When this section was revised on December 18, 1986,the language that was in the Code of Federal Regulations before July 30,1985 was inadvertently used. Since there was no intention to change thesubstance of this pargraph in December, 1986, we would restore the earlierlanguage.4. We are also proposing to change the references in the regulations from``MMIS'' (which appear in andSection;andSection; 433.121 and 433.131), to ``system,''which is the short form for the term ``mechanized claims processing andinformation retrieval system'' and is currently in use in all sectionsin Part 433, Subpart C except andSection; 433.131. We have not defined ``MMIS''in regulations and would make the change for consistency.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Proposed Revisions to Implement Pub. L. 99-272</ITAG>We also propose revising our regulations to implement sections 9503(b)(2)and 9518 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1935(COBRA) (Pub. L. 99-272), as enacted April 7, 1986.Section 9503(b)(2)(A) of the COBRA amends section 1903(r)(4)(A) of theAct by requiring the Secretary to review each approved system at leastonce every three years, instead of once a year. Section 9503(b)(2)(B) amendssection 1903(r)(4)(A) of the Act to permit the Secretary, at his discretion,to review either the entire system of a given State agency or only thosestandards, system requirements and other conditions demonstrating weaknessin previous reviews.Section 9518 of the COBRA amends section 1903(r)(1)(B) of the Act so thatState agencies must have had an approved system no later than September30, 1985, instead of September 30, 1982. The amendment applies to paymentmade under section 1903(a) of the Act for calendar quarters beginning onor after October 1, 1982.We would revise andSection; 433.119, Conditions for yearly approval; noticeof decision, to show that we would review each system operation at leastonce every three years and to indicate that we would not have to reviewthe entire system but we would, at a minimum, have to review parts of thesystem operation that showed weaknesses in the previous review.We would revise andSection; 433.122 to delete the references to ``yearly''review.We propose to revise andSection; 433.113, Reduction of FFP for failure tooperate a system and obtain initial approval, to change the deadline bywhich an agency must have an approved system to September 30, 1985.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Funding for Optional Systems and Subsystems</ITAG>Many State agencies receive enhanced funding for system applications forthird party liability (TPL), which are integrated with the core systemor subsystem, or for an eligibility determination system, or both.1. Third Party LiabilityWe interpret section 9503(a) of COBRA as requiring State Medicaid agenciesto have an approved plan of action for TPL and to use the system to carryout the plan of action. We currently require the COBRA-mandated statutoryTPL changes as part of the core system by regulation (42 CFR 433.112(b)(2)).If these requirements are not currently part of the system approved forenhanced matching, they should be implemented as HCFA requirements to allapproved systems for which enhanced matching is claimed. Performance ofthe system in meeting these requirements will continue to be monitoredby the system reapproval review required by section 1903(r)(4) of the Act.The TPL plan required by COBRA will also be monitored as part of this approvalreview within the limits of system requirements and performance standards(Sections 1903(r)(4) requires us to reduce FFP for the disapproved systemif performance standards are not met.) No new system requirements or performancestandards are need to implement COBRA. If system modifications are requiredin some States to meet COBRA requirements, we will continue to make enhancedFFP available for modifications to those TPL systems that are part of therequired core system. We are publishing a separate regulation concerningthe TPL plan requirements of COBRA. (See 52 FR 6350, March 3, 1987, forthe proposed rule, State Plan Requirements for TPL Collections.)2. Eligibility determination systems<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Background</ITAG>Eligibility of many Medicaid applicants and recipients is determined byan agency other than the State Medicaid agency. Under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(I)of the Act, States must provide Medicaid to all recipients of AFDC benefits(administered under the auspices of the Family Services Administration)and certain individuals who are deemed to be recipients of AFDC. Therefore,the determination of Medicaid eligibility for these individuals is madeby the State's AFDC agency.Under sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) and 1902(f) of the Act, States havethe option of providing Medicaid to all recipients of Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI) (cash benefits to aged, blind, and disabled individuals) orto use more restrictive requirements of eligiblity than SSI for determinationsof Medicaid eligibility for aged, blind, and disabled individuals. FourteenStates have elected to use more restrictive requirements for Medicaid eligibilityfor the aged, blind, and disabled, and therefore the State Medicaid agencymakes the eligibility determination. Five States use SSI criteria for thedetermination of Medicaid eligibility and require recipients of SSI tofile a Medicaid application with the State Medicaid agency. (These fiveStates must provide Medicaid to all recipients of SSI who file for Medicaid.)The remaining States have entered into an agreement with the Social SecurityAdministration (SSA) to determine Medicaid eligiblity for aged, blind,and disabled individuals. In these States, SSA provides the State Medicaidagency with information on the current eligibility status of all applicantsand recipients of SSI benefits.There are additional groups of individuals that States are required tocover under their Medicaid plan_for example, qualified pregnant women andchildren under age eight and individuals who lose eligibility for SSI benefitsbecause of a cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits. Threeare also groups of individuals that States may elect to cover under theMedicaid plans_for example, the medically needy and recipients of optionalState supplements. The State Medicaid agency may make Medicaid eligibilitydeterminations for these individuals or amy enter into an agreement withanother agency to make the determinations.The amount of work involved in making Medicaid eligibility determinationsfor individuals other than AFDC and SSI recipients can vary from minimal,where Medicaid eligibility requirements differ from the cash assistanceprograms' requirements by only one or two criteria, to complex, where theMedicaid program's medically needy criteria are far more restrictive thancriteria for welfare payments. In all cases, the eligibility determinationis derived from a cash welfare-assistance determination; the Medicaid agencydoes not determine eligibility as a totally separate process from the cashwelfare eligibility determination. As a result, in States where the Medicaidagency has an eligibility determination system, the system is integratedas a multi-program (AFDC, Food Stamps, Medicaid and other welfare programs)system. Most States are in the process of developing integrated systems.Medicaid pays its allocated share of the costs of the integrated system.During the mid-1970's, a number of dramatic systems improvements supporteda decision increasing the availability of enhanced funding. In one State,once a mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system wasinstalled, there were Medicaid savings of approximately $25 million inthe first three months and $100 million in the first year. Consequently,HCFA recognized some costs that benefited the operation of the mechanizedclaims processing and information retrieval system as reimbursable at enhancedrates of FFP and that were likely to provide more efficient, economicaland effective administration of the State plan.A similar line of reasoning applied to eligibility determination systems.Large sums of money depend on the accuracy and timeliness of eligibilitydeterminations. Therefore, a system that enhances the accuracy and timelinessof eligibility determinations benefits the program. The first eligibilitydetermination system was primarily installed to benefit a State Medicaidprogram, and a large proportion (40 percent of the installation and 30percent of the operation) of the cost of this particular system was allocatedto Medicaid, and the remainder to other welfare programs. Other Statesbegan to request enhanced funding for Medicaid eligibility determinationsystems, and we supplied it but our allocation was smaller. Some improvementin accuracy and timeliness of claims processing of provider claims resulted.Since 1977, HCFA has made available 90 percent FFP for the design, development,installation or improvement of eligibility determination systems, subjectto approved APDs, and 75 percent FFP for the subsequent operation of thesesystems, on the basis that applications for eligibility were ``claims''and that a system processing these ``claims'' was a part of the mechanizedclaims processing and information retrieval system.In 1981, section 403(a)(3)(B) of the Act, which refers to AFDC, as addedby section 406 of Pub. L. 96-265, requires the Secretary to provide 90percent FFP for the design, development and installation of a mechanizedeligibility determination system that meets the requirements of section402(a)(30) of the Act. In addition, the section requires the Secretaryto determine that the systems are ``likely to provide more efficient, economical,and effective administration of the plan and to be compatible with theclaims processing and information retrieval systems utilized in the administrationof State plans approved under title XIX . . .'' SSA published an interimfinal rule (45 CFR 205.35 through 205.38) on September 30, 1981 (45 FR47784) to implement this provision, and a final rule on April 17, 1986(51 FR 13001). The 90 percent FFP has been available for quarters beginningon and after July 1, 1981.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Proposal</ITAG>Eligibility determination systems would no longer be eligible for any enhancedFFP for Medicaid purposes under the proposed definition of mechanized claimsprocessing and information retrieval systems, since enhanced FFP wouldbe available only for costs directly attributable to approved Medicaidsystems. Because eligibility determination systems would not be used toprocess claims by ``providers of medical care and services for the medicalcare and services furnished to the recipients'', we would not require theirimplementation or operation, as part of the core subsystems.AFDC agencies now may receive 90 percent FFP for implementing eligibilitydetermination systems, giving those agencies considerable incentive, becauseof the cost and benefits, to implement a system. A State Medicaid agency'sinvolvement in eligibility determinations is minimal (either because AFDCor SSI makes the determination_by law or under contract_or because thedetermination is derived from eligibility for AFDC or SSI), and not adequatein terms of cost and benefits to justify defining mechanized claims processingand information retrieval system to cover implementation or operation ofeligibility determination systems.In addition, Congress purposely required that 90 percent FFP be made availablefor AFDC eligibility determination systems by adding section 403(a)(3)(B)of tha Act, effective July 1, 1981, and did not do so for Medicaid. Anyincentive provided by partial title XIX enhanced funding before 1981 hasbeen superseded by the explicit funding authority under section 403(a)(3)of the Act. This authority has encouraged 44 States to design eligibilitydetermination systems, principally with title IV funding. Because thereis no explicit statutory funding authority under title XIX, HCFA is notrequired to make enhanced FFP available for eligibility determination systemsand there is no further need to do do.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. FFP for an Eligibility Determination System</ITAG>We propose that, in order to receive any FFP for Medicaid purposes foran eligibility determination system after the effective date of the finalrule, a State agency would have to submit an APD in accordance with therequirements of 45 CFR Part 95, Subpart F, for funding. Once we approvethe APD, the State agency would receive 50 percent FFP for administrativecosts under section 1903(a)(7) of the Act for the system's design, development,installation, and operation.A State Medicaid agency with a currently approved APD for a mechanizedeligibility determination system would receive Medicaid enhanced fundingat 90 percent under paragraph 1903(a)(3)(A) until the effective date ofthe final version of these regulations. Once the final version is effective,all Medicaid enhanced funding would terminate and Medicaid funding foroperation of mechanized eligibility determination and information retrievalsystems would be at the 50 percent rate under section 1903(a)(7) of theAct. Any APDs approved by HCFA for eligibility determination systems afterthe effective date of the final rule would be funded at the 50 percentrate. Eligibility determination system operations being funded at the enhancedoperations rate of 75 percent before the effective date of the final regulationwould be funded by HCFA at the 50 percent rate after the effective date.We propose to add a paragraph to andSection; 433.112 to exclude eligibilitydetermination systems specifically from funding at enhanced rates.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>1. Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aninitial regulatory impact analysis for any proposed regulations that arelikely to meet criteria for a ``major rule''.A major rule is one that would result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or any geographic regions;or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.There are currently 45 States that have approved core systems in place.These States would not receive enhanced FFP for those parts of their systemsthat do not fit the proposed definition of ``mechanized claims processingand information retrieval system''. We expect some of these States to bearan increased share of data processing costs. However, this would not bea major cost increase for affected States nor would it meet any of theother criteria for major rules. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysisis not required.2. Regulatory Flexibility ActConsistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through612), we prepare and publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysisfor proposed regulations unless the Secretary certifies that the regulationswould not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.Under the RFA, States are not considered small entities. Therefore, wehave determined, and the Secretary certifies, that these proposed regulationswould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities, and we have not prepared an initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paperwork Burden</ITAG>These changes do not impose paperwork collection requirements. Consequently,they need not be reviewed by the Executive Office of Management and Budgetunder the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3801<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Response to Comments</ITAG>Because of the large number of comments we receive on proposed regulations,we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, in preparingthe final rule, we will consider all comments received timely and respondto the major issues in the preamble to that rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">G.
