Stella Goldberg also named the convicted killer, Darrell VanMastright, in her lawsuit, filed Monday in Allegheny County court.   Mrs. Goldberg claimed that both the university and thefraternity failed to curb the consumption of alcohol and thesmoking of marijuana by students at the party that preceded herdaughter's death.   After a non-jury trial before Common Pleas Court Judge Robert E.Dauer, Van Mastright, 19, was found guilty of first-degree murderin the Feb. 8, 1987, killing of Jeanne Goldberg, 20, a student atRobert Morris College.   Van Mastright is serving a life sentence at the StateCorrectional Institution at Pittsburgh.   Testimony during Van Mastright's trial showed that he wasintroduced to Goldberg on the Carnegie Mellon campus. They attendedan off-campus party at Delta Tau Delta, where they drank liquor andsmoked marijuana, according to testimony.   In her suit, Mrs. Goldberg claimed the university and thefraternity abdicated their ``parental responsibilities'' by failingto restrict the consumption of alcohol and drugs by students,particularly those under 21.   The stabbing would not have occurred, the suit contended, if VanMastright ``had not been crazed by the large amount of alcohol,combined with the quantity of marijuana.''   Among the damages Mrs. Goldberg is seeking is what her daughtermight have earned had she fulfilled her ambition of becoming an FBIagent.</TEXT></DOC>
