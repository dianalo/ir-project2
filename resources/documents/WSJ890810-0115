According to your editorial, &quot;Even if Roe v. Wade is overturned outright, the most that will happen is that to get an abortion some women in certain places will have to cross state lines.&quot; On page one, the story &quot;Turning Point?&quot; states, &quot;the chief effect of the landmark Supreme Court decision upholding Missouri's restrictive abortion law will be to widen the disparity in access to abortion between rich and poor. . . . for the young, the poor and those in rural areas, abortion will become more difficult to find and, for some, all but impossible.&quot;    You further feel that &quot;the pro-choice reaction . . . is sheer hysteria,&quot; implying the response is both unwarranted and emotionally based, but in yet another story in the same issue it's reported that the now-defensive pro-choice coalition faces a &quot;battleground&quot; with &quot;only nine states where both houses of the legislature favor keeping abortion legal, and in six of them the margins are narrow. Moreover, in about half the states both houses of the legislature favor making abortion illegal.&quot;    Are you questioning the integrity of your journalists here? Or do these careless statements reflect the real feelings behind the statement of support for &quot;Roe v. Wade in terms of social policy&quot;?    Cynthia A. Kater    Raleigh, N.C.    ---   I know exactly when my life began: The moment my mother's egg was fertilized by my father's sperm, creating a combination of all the things necessary to produce a unique, never to be duplicated human: me. From that moment, had anyone killed me, in or out of the womb, I would not now exist. As far as my death is concerned, the only difference would be in the timing.    Of course, there was no freedom of choice for me as to whether I should be aborted or allowed to live. Had there been, I would not have chosen to be aborted.    Would you?    George L. Worsdall    Brunswick, Ohio    ---   You correctly show that in the Common Law, abortion before &quot;quickening&quot; or ensoulment was not considered the taking of life. That historical view is also the position with which the American people generally still agree.    Moreover, as the Alan Guttmacher Institute shows, more than 90% of abortions occur within the first 12 weeks -- within the first trimester as Roe v. Wade and Webster v. Reproductive Health Services Inc. provide -- so that women to whom the right is most important are exercising that right consistent with the same respect for the sanctity of spiritual being (as distinguished from merely physical existence).    Your editorial is well ahead of this public-policy matter as the Supreme Court this fall takes up the next three related cases. But the American Bar Association and the legislatures of 42 states are ahead of both your editorial and the conservative Supreme Court by about 15 years.    George Barbary    Dallas    ---   Surely you're not suggesting a fertilized ovum is as likely to develop into a frog, a plant, an amoeba or maybe a virus (your words) as it is into a human. Of course it's a human being. What else could it be?    Your supercilious reference to the magic moment when life begins is uncalled for. It is indeed a magical, awesome, sacred moment and it occurs, oddly enough, at the beginning. Do you seriously mean to suggest it occurs at some other time, perhaps at the stroke of the first midnight following the end of the first trimester?    Equally amusing (were it not so sad) is your endorsement of the quaint notion of &quot;quickening.&quot; How hard must the child kick before you will acknowledge his or her right to life and limb?    Rev. Jerome McHugh    White Plains, N.Y.    ---   Anti-abortionists are gloating over the court's decision. They used to promote themselves as &quot;pro-life&quot; -- their new slogan is &quot;Stop Baby Killing.&quot; If they were sincerely concerned about the welfare of America's children, they would campaign against the homelessness, hunger and abuse that so many children suffer. Why aren't they speaking out about the lack of medical care for poor children?    George Orwell described the phenomenon in the novel &quot;1984&quot;: If a government can control a people's sexual energy, it can control the population completely.    Bruce Joffe    Piedmont, Calif.    ---   I've noticed some ironies that make the pro-lifers' stand seem hypocritical:    1) A significant number of the pro-life people are also against birth control. Proper advice and timely help on birth control can prevent the need for most abortions, making this emotional issue largely moot.    2) If life is beautiful and every fetus has a right to live no matter the circumstances under which it will be born, why are the pro-life people abandoning these fetuses once they're born? How many of them are active in facilitating adoptions? How many have adopted unwanted children, especially black, Hispanic or handicapped?    3) And, in a plot right out of an absurdist play, a significant number of pro-life people are also conservative &quot;law and order&quot; people who favor the death penalty. What happened to the sanctity of life?    Girish V. Nadkarni    Chatham, N.J.    ---   You don't need religious terms to define life. Common sense will do. Science gives us dramatic pictures of the live baby growing in the mother. If you don't start life at conception, then when? The day of birth? Three months before? Six months? When? Without conception, no baby. Conception starts the baby. Conception starts life.    Jack Dunn    Los Angeles    ---   To imply that it is morally permissible to terminate (pre-human? nonhuman? subhuman?) life before some nebulous date when it may become human is absurd.    Whatever that &quot;indeterminate&quot; form of life may be, we know it never develops into a crocodile or a virus. Unless arbitrarily snuffed out, it is invariably a human. Why? Because it was one to begin with.    Charles W. McCollester    South Bend, Ind. </TEXT></DOC>
