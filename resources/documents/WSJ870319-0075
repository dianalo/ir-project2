The measure represents an attempt to please Canada before President Reagan's summit in Ottawa next month with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who yesterday praised the plan as &quot;an important and helpful step.&quot;    U.S. environmentalists attacked the proposal, however, calling it misguided because it earmarks funds for research on new technology rather than using current technology, as West Germany has been doing, to reduce sulfur emissions through existing equipment such as &quot;scrubbers.&quot;    The plan closely follows recommendations that were made last spring by envoys from the U.S. and Canada, and endorsed by Messrs. Mulroney and Reagan. Despite that endorsement, Mr. Reagan's budget proposal for acid-rain programs in fiscal 1988 originally was far lower than the Canadians had hoped.    The new plan will seek to spend $500 million a year for the next five years to fund innovative projects that would reduce sulfur emissions from coal-fired power plants. For fiscal 1988, the administration will ask Congress to approve another $300 million above the $50 million in the January budget proposal. These funds would be in addition to the $150 million already approved by Congress for fiscal 1988, which begins next Oct. 1.    Private industry also will be asked to spend at least the same amount on innovative pollution-control technology, according to the president's statement yesterday.    In addition, Mr. Reagan directed Energy Secretary John Herrington to establish an advisory panel of state, federal and Canadian officials to select which projects will be funded. Vice President George Bush's regulatory relief task force will review federal and state regulatory programs to examine tax and other incentives that can assist in the emission-control efforts, the statement said.    The efforts are aimed at controlling the problem of acidic rain, snow or fog that results after pollutants are emitted from electric power plants, factories and automobiles.    Canadian officials praised the new proposal but said they would prefer that the U.S. establish an actual emissions-control program that would curb sulfur emissions by 50%.    Michael McCloskey, Sierra Club director, charged that the new spending &quot;will not reduce acid rain by a single drop&quot; because it is for research rather than actual emission control. He called the plan &quot;a smokescreen to obscure the administration's opposition to acid rain control.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
