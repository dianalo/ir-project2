On Thursday, the new government led by President Violeta Barriosde Chamorro announced that landlords whose property was seized bythe Sandinistas will have six months to file claims.   She also said all unused agricultural and pasture land will berented out on a provisional basis and a commission will study howmuch rent will be charged.   ``They would have to go over the cadavers of the cooperativemembers and small producers'' if the government tried to take backland, according to Daniel Nunez, president of the NationalAgricultural Workers Union.   ``We will not allow the application of these laws which aretotally against the people,'' Nunez said. His comments werepublished in the pro-Sandinista Nuevo Diario newspaper.   The U.S.-backed Mrs. Chamorro has said she will review all lawspassed by the leftist Sandinistas during their 10 years in office.Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated Daniel Ortega in elections in February,replaced him April 25.   The Sandinistas handed out weapons among supporters beforeleaving office, and Mrs. Chamorro has ordered the military to takeback those weapons.   Some civilians began turning in their weapons over the weekend.Ninety-nine farm workers turned over their rifles to authorities inLa Verbena, about 180 miles southeast of Managua, on Saturday.   Nunez said 50,000 farm union members will rally outside thepresidential palace to protest Mrs. Chamorro's decree and demand 10percent of the $300 million in U.S. aid earmarked for Nicaragua beused for farm credits.   During its decade in power, the Sandinistas confiscated and gaveaway thousands of privately owned farms. The Sandinistas onSaturday called Mrs. Chamorro's decrees ``dictatorial andunconstitutional.''   The government has refused to give public employees a 200percent raise to make up for inflation. Government workers went onstrike last week after rejecting a government offer of 60 percent.   Among measures announced Thursday, Mrs. Chamorro suspended acivil service law that protected employees from being fired andgranted them the right to strike and bargain collectively. She hassaid the country is virtually bankrupt.</TEXT></DOC>
