Jr.; Riggs, Michael; Smith, Jim.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>METAFILING Your information regarding the PCX format in the December 12,1989,issue was very informative.andP;  Do you also have a source regarding the CGMformat?andM;Jim SmithandM;Forest Lake, MinnesotaandM;Unlike the PCX graphics format, which is a de facto standard because of itswidespread use, the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) format is ratified bythe American National Standards Institute (ANSI); specifically, it's the ANSIX3.122-1986 standard.andP;  Hence, the specifications are available for $45 fromANSI (1430 Broadway, New York, NY 10018; (212) 642-4900).andM;If you're a programmer searching for CGM-related utilities and subroutines,one company to get in touch with is Graphic Software Systems Inc., a.k.a.andO;GSS (9590 SW Gemini Dr., Beaverton, OR 97005; (503) 641-2200).andP;  GSS sells theCGM Interpreter ($395), a linkable subroutine library whose functions includereading, interpreting, modifying, and redrawing.CGM files.andM;On the other hand, if you're just looking to convert.CGM-format files toother formats, there are a few packages at your disposal.andP;  Zenographics'sImPort ($295) is the most general, converting from.CGM to.PIC,.DXF,.IMA(Mirage), and HPGL files.andP;  (Zenographics, 19752 MacArthur Blvd., #250,Irvine, CA 92715; (714) 851-6352.) The company also offers Plus versions ofImPort, one of which supports the HP PaintJet XL, as well as Targa and TIFFinput files ($395).andP;  A Microsoft Windows-specific version should be out bythe time you read this.andM;Kinetic Software's CADConvert ($100) is more limited, only converting .DXFfiles to.CGM.andP;  (Kinetic Software, 240 Distillery Commons, Louisville, KY40206; (502) 583-1679.)andM;And last, Digital Research offers a series of Filter Packs ($15 per pack) ,one of which converts.CGM files into a GEM-compatible format.andP;  (DigitalResearch, 70 Garden Ct., Monterey, CA 93942; (800) 443-4200, (408) 649-3896.)andO;BEATING THE SYSTEMS Few engineers or scientists would attempt to use the typeof software your February 27, 1990, Advisor column suggests to solvelarge-scale systems of equations.andP;  Derive and Mathematica have excellentsymbolic capabilities, but the idea of a practical symbolic solution of ageneral system of 25 equations with 25 unknowns is quite unrealistic.andM;As you indicate, a principal difficulty in the numerical solution of largelinear (and nonlinear) systems is the accumulation of round-off errors thatcan swamp the solution being sought.andP;  Two decades of work by leadingnumerical analysts led to the development of the well-known mainframepackages LINPACK and EISPACK for the reliable solution of large linearsystems.andP;  The best MS-DOS implementation of these techniques is PC-Matlab,which permits the numerical solution of a 90 by 90 linear system on an 8088machine (and also includes nonlinear methods).andM;The current release, Version 3.5, includes an 80286 version that breaks the640K barrier by using 1MB of extended memory to run in protected mode.andP;  Thereis also a 386-Matlab version that has no limits on matrix or workspace size(subject to available memory), and hence allows mainframe-size problems to besolved.andM;All versions of Matlab require a numeric coprocessor, and include excellentgraphics in an interactive user environment that assumes little or noprogramming experience.andM;C.H.andP;  Edwards, Jr.andM;Athens, GeorgiaandM;Several readers popped out of the woodwork to offer suggestions on this one.andO;PC-Matlab ($795) and 386-Matlab  ($1,495), a mathematical toolbox thatstresses matrix operations, received the most nominations, and is certainly aviable alternative.andP;  We looked at the package in  &quot;Better Tools for HigherMath: When Numbers Count,&quot; in the March 14, 1989, issue of PC Magazine (theprogram is listed as Matlab, not PC-Matlab).andP;  (The MathWorks Inc., 21 EliotSt., South Natick, MA 01760; (508) 653-1415.)andM;Another reader chastised me for listing several very expensive solutions; heperforms all of his matrix manipulations using a short BASIC program.andP;  Ofcourse, you needn't confine yourself to BASIC-you can use almost anylanguage, if you're inclined to program.andM;One language especially optimized for mathematical operations is APL (AProgramming Language).andP;  Versions of APL range from IAPL Ltd.'s public domainAPL interpreter (downloadable from either Data Library 4 of the Programmingforum on PC MagNet or Data Library 5 of the IBMPRO forum on CompuServe, bothunder the filename IAPL11.ARC) to the full-blown APL*Plus/PC offered by STSC($695; 2115 E. Jefferson St., Rockville, MD 20852; (800) 592-0050, (301)984-5123), or APL*Plus II ($1,700), which runs on 386s.andP;  ADVISING THE ADVISORThe Advisor column in your January 16, 1990, issue answers a question aboutrecording EGA or VGA output on a VCR.andP;  Although your reply ultimately sendsthe reader in the right direction, it also contains some misinformation.andM;The output from an EGAcard is not, as you state, composite video-it is RGB(red-green-blue).andP;  CGA cards typically provide composite as well as RGBoutput, but the RCA-pin jacks on EGA cards are for the feature connector anddo not carry any sort of video signal.andM;More serious, however, is your confusion about the nature of Super VHS.andP;  Allthat distinguishes S-VHS from regular VHS is the greater luminance bandwidththe system can record, which increases its horizontal resolution.andP;  Regardlessof format, VCRs normally have both radio-frequency and composite-video inputsand outputs; any device that will work with a VHS VCR will work at least aswell with an S-VHS VCR.andM;The explanation you give to the contrary appears to be based on a commonmisconception about the relationship between S-VHS and the S-Video (or Y/C)connectors commonly found on S-VHS, Hi8, and ED Beta VCRs.andP;  These connectorsare not fundamental to any of these formats.andP;  They simply minimize adisadvantage in the way that a video signal is formatted for recording onconsumer VCRs.andM;In a composite-video signal, the chrominance information is on a subcarriernear the top of the luminance baseband signal.andP;  Consumer VCRs lack thebandwidth necessary to record a composite-video signal directly (as on alaserdisk or a professional videotape recorder) without losing or manglingthe color information.andP;  Instead, they separate the chrominance and transposeit down to a range of frequencies below what is used to record the luminanceportion of the signal.andM;But unless an S-Video connector is used, the chrominance and luminance mustbe recombined into a composite-video signal for playback, and then the videomonitor or television set must re-separate them on the way to assembling anRGB signal to drive the electron guns in its picture tube.andP;  S-Videoconnectors simply short-circuit this process, sending the luminance andchrominance signals directly from the VCR to the monitor, bypassing a cycleof merging and splitting that otherwise would be necessary.andP;  The visiblebenefit of using an S-Video connection usually ranges from very subtle tononexistent.andP;  The superiority of S-VHS over regular VHS is fully apparentwith an ordinary composite-video connection.andM;Michael RiggsandM;New York, New YorkandM;I appreciate the lucid setting-straight on the video issues.andP;  We hope topresent a similarly useful explication and evaluation of genlocking VGA toNTSC boards in a forthcoming issue of PC Magazine.andP;  ASK THE ADVISOR Send yourquestions to Advisor, PC Magazine, One Park Ave., New York, NY 10016, orupload them to PC MagNet (see the &quot;By Modem&quot; sidebar in the Utilities columnfor access information).andP;  Please specify your equipment.andP;  *andO;</TEXT></DOC>
