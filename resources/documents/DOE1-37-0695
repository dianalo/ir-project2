The positions of the resonances are used to determinethe unresolved hyperfine structure of the 3d states from which the magnetic-dipolehyperfine interaction constants A are derived. The results for the Afactors are: A(3d /sup 2/D/sub 3/2/; /sup 23/Na) = +527(25) kHz; A(3d/sup 2/D/sub 5/2/; /sup 23/Na) = +108.5(2.4) kHz; (A(3d /sup 2/D/sub3/2/; /sup 7/Li) = +843(41) kHz; A(3d /sup 2/D/sub 5/2/; /sup 7/Li) =+343.6(1.0) kHz. For the fine structure intervals fs of the 3d doubletswe obtain: fs(3d Na) = -1494444(44) kHz and fs(3d Li) = +1083936(60)kHz. The linewidths of the resonances are evaluated with respect to thenatural lifetimes of the 3d states. For Na the result is tau(3d Na) =19.27(23) ns.</TEXT></DOC>
