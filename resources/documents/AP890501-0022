(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Radio and TV stations could help takediscussion of sex and AIDS out of the locker room and into thenation's living rooms, but the language must be frank enough topersuade skeptical teens to practice safe sex, broadcasters weretold.   Panelists at a National Association of Broadcasters conventionsaid Sunday that broadcasters can expect heavy criticism from somegroups for public discussions of safe sex, but if they stick totheir guns they also can change minds.   Americans need ``direct language about sexuality itself, aboutsexual behavior, about sexual decision making so that it's noteuphemistic and abstract and something they can't mentally cueinto,'' said Mary Lee Tatum, a sex educator at George MasonUniversity.   She said too often movies and television treat sex as a ``dirtyjoke'' or as something in which people lose their reasoningabilities in fits of passion. At the same time, kids are told byauthority figures to think before they have sex. They often don'tlisten, she said.   ``We're hindered by the fact that we think that any serious talkabout any kind of sexual behavior is pornographic,'' she said.   Critics can be a ``potent force'' against frank publicdiscussions of sex, but another panelist, William Miller of KTVK-TVin Phoenix, said it is important that broadcasters take a chance.   ``These kinds of campaigns take a lot of guts because initiallyyou're really hit with an awful lot of rejection,'' Miller said.   But, he said, ``broadcasters have a lot to do with determiningwhat's acceptable and what's not acceptable and how we talk topeople within our society.''   He said his station found it difficult to find corporate backersfor an anti-AIDS campaign because ``there's a stigma with AIDS.They were afraid of being the AIDS electric company ... the AIDSconvenience store.''   But people's minds can be changed, Miller said, noting that aPhoenix Catholic bishop's position on public service announcementsabout condoms changed so that now he ``is one of the mostsupportive people we have.''   ``After you see some of these things on television it becomeseasier to talk about the subject. A lot of it is up to us,'' hesaid.   Tatum said educators are looking for good visual material onAIDS and would welcome broadcasters' assistance.   Toby Pate, marketing director at KPIX-TV in San Francisco, saidher station's Emmy Award-winning public service show, ``AIDSLifeline,'' is being distributed to stations in 55 cities and isbeing used by schools.   Reed Tuckson, public health commissioner for Washington D.C.,said the rate of new AIDS cases is declining in areas with heavygay populations, while it is increasing in areas outside urbancenters.   He said such statistics show the value of public educationcampaigns.   The panel discussion attracted less than 30 audience members atthis convention, which is being attended by nearly 50,000broadcasters.   One member of the audience, Delbert Lewis, also from the Phoenixstation, said he was ``angry'' that more broadcasters ``had nottaken this ball and run with it and expounding more on the AIDSproblem. ... We could do more,'' he said.   Another audience member, Jordan Cohen of WFMJ in Youngstown,Ohio, said ``the fact that this room is nowhere near full, not even50 percent, shows that there still is maybe a lot of educating tobe done among our own.''   An NAB official said the organization for the past 18 months hasbeen distributing AIDS spots and written material to radio and TVstations, along with suggestions for possible campaigns.   NAB also has been helping distribute material from ElizabethTaylor's anti-AIDS program, Americans for Aids Research, said RoryBenson, an NAB vice president in charge of public serviceactivities.   ``We didn't have any negative feedback,'' she said in aninterview.   A new campaign to be launched before the end of the year willallow stations to target high-risk groups with more explicitmaterial, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
