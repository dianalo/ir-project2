The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike Synar (D., Okla.), issimilar to a law under which record makers are allowed to barrentals. The software measure sailed through the Committee bya voice vote, despite objections from video rental storeoperators.</LP><TEXT>   Sponsors are expected to push for early action on themeasure. The Senate already has passed similar legislation.   The idea behind the bill is that it is easy to copy bothrecords and computer software stored on floppy disks. Rentalsthus are considered to undercut copyrights held bymanufacturers. Games often are priced from $40 to $50. Underthe bill, manufacturers could allow rentals or bar them. Inthe case of records, most makers don't allow rentals.   The bill applies to a wide range of computer software, inaddition to video games, but rentals of games by stores thatspecialize mainly in renting movies is the main focus of theissue.</TEXT></DOC>
