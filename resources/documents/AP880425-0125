Since the signing of the Geneva agreement on April 14, theguerrillas _ who were not party to the accord _ also have steppedup their war against the communists with about a dozen reportedoperations inside the country.   More than 180 enemy troops have been killed or wounded,including 20 Soviets, the guerrillas say.   ``What is clear is that in the current month and especiallysince the signing of the Geneva accord, a significant number ofenemy military and command posts have fallen to the mujahedeen,''said Burhaneddin Rabanni, leader of the Jamiat Islami Party, oneparty in the seven-member anti-communist front.   ``These are the last days of the war,'' contended Hamed Karzai,spokesman for the moderate National Liberation Front. ``As in anywar, towards its end, fighting intensifies. Both sides try toestablish their hegemony.''   Rabanni said soon after the Geneva accord was signed by theUnited States, the Soviet Union, Pakistan and Afghanistan, theguerrillas gave orders to all field commanders to launch attacks onenemy strongholds.   The rebels have also begun setting up new military bases insideAfghanistan, he said.   Last week's guerrilla takeover of the Afghan army garrison atBarikot on the Pakistan border should aid the guerrillas in thisendeavor.   The guerrillas said Friday's victory opened a new, direct supplyroute for weapons into Afghanistan. President Najib acknowledgedthe guerrilla victory on Sunday.   On Monday, the guerrillas also claimed to have taken control ofthree other strategic towns in recent weeks: Ghorband, 50 milesnorth of Kabul, and Maarouf and Darwazgai, both in the south about30 miles from the Pakistani bordar.   The Soviet Union has said it will begin withdrawing its 115,000troops from Afghanistan on May 15. Its troops entered Afghanistanin 1979 to quell an uprsing by anti-communist guerrillas.   On the political front, the the leaders of the seven-partyguerrilla alliance disagree about the structure of a ``provisionalgovernment'' and how to go about setting it up.   Ahmad Shah, a 44-year-old engineer with the hardline IttihadIslami Party who has been named president of the provisionalgovernment, said the 14-member cabinet will meet once a week tooutline new programs and plans.   But Sebaghatullah Mojadeddi, leader of the moderate NationalFront believes the provisional government is a ``joke.''   ``How can we have a government when it has not been approved bythe people,'' he said. ``Up to 700,000 Afghans are armed and whenthe government is weak, there are going to be clashes andbloodshed.''   The parties are also divided over the form of elections to beheld for approving an interim government.   Some want elections among the estimated 3 million Afghanrefugees in Pakistan: others favor elections inside Afghanistan aswell as in Pakistan.   The guerrillas do agree on one thing: there is no chance forreconciliation with Afghan President Najib and his communistsupporters.   They differ, however, on the question of how to deal with thecommunists should they be overthrown.   Alliance chief Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, the most hardline of theguerrilla leaders has called for a trial of Najib and othercommunists.   Mojaddedi, however, says if Najib and others ``repent'' and``embrace Islam'' they ought to be pardoned.   ``This is not the time for revenge,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
