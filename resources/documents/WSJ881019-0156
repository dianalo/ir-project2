The fuss is about the growing use or abuse of services that provide lecture notes to students. Consider Grade A Notes, a fledgling Columbus, Ohio, company that offers typed notes to Ohio State University students for $2 per class, courtesy of other students hired to attend the classes. For the truly lazy, it offers a three-month &quot;subscription&quot; for just $18.95.    &quot;For $2, you couldn't hire a friend to sit in class for an hour,&quot; says Kathy Gatton, president of Grade A Notes, who says she got the idea for the service while attending the University of Texas at Austin. She occasionally bought notes there and claims it &quot;helped me learn to take better notes&quot; and be a better student.    Business has been so good that Ms. Gatton hopes to offer Grade A Notes at 10 more universities within the next five years.    Such plans make educators cringe. They worry that a college degree could be reduced to a few trips to the notes supermarket. &quot;My guess is that it will quickly become widespread because of peer pressure,&quot; laments Randy Knight, vice chairman for undergraduate studies in Ohio State's physics department.    Mr. Knight and others criticize the service for helping students miss classes. But some teachers defend the service, maintaining it's helpful even for upper-level courses. &quot;It's a good outline,&quot; says Raymond Montemayor, an assistant professor in psychology. Ohio State administrators, meanwhile, say they have no official policy on such matters.    Ms. Gatton asserts that the service is simply a study tool and isn't meant as a substitute for attending lectures: &quot;We're helping people get by,&quot; she says. But perhaps not all students. Senior Mary Kreuz purchased the notes for a media law course but now regrets taking the short cut. &quot;I depended on them more than I should have,&quot; admits the journalism major, who will be taking the course again. </TEXT></DOC>
