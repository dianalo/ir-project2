U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III said he wasstepping down from the bench after seven years to return tobetter-paying private practice.   Attorneys for Drexel and creditors said the departure woulddelay proceedings while his replacement becomes familiar with thelargest collapse of a financial firm in Wall Street history.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Conrad, who sits in Rutland, Vt.,was named to take over the Drexel proceedings. Attorneys saidConrad has indicated he will spend about two weeks per month in NewYork on the case.   Buschman, 46, was appointed to a 14-year term in 1983, but saidhe had ``regretfully concluded that the financial needs of myfamily will not permit me to continue to serve out the remainder ofthe term to which I was appointed.''   The judge said he was under consideration for a job at anunidentified law firm that has represented a creditor in the Drexelcase but not filed any pleadings or argued in court before him.   Buschman said that he was not required to disqualify himselffrom the case and he was reluctant to burden another judge with thecase, but ``in an excess of caution I think it appropriate torequest that these cases be reassigned.''   The judge also had presided over the Chapter 11 proceedings ofThomson McKinnon Securities Inc.   Buschman won praise from attorneys in the seven-month-old Drexelcase for his preparation, attention to detail and ability tocontrol often contentious proceedings.   ``I'm sorry we're losing him,'' Alan Miller, an attorney forDrexel, said. ``This has been a difficult case and I think he'sdone a job of keeping it under control.''   Attorneys said they expected delays in the case while JudgeConrad digests the background of the bankruptcy proceedings todate. ``You can't read a case and a file, you also have tounderstand some of the dynamics that go into a decision,'' he said.   ``It's a very complicated bankruptcy case with a number ofinter-relationships,'' said Barry Dichter, who represents a largeDrexel creditor. ``It will take a new judge some time to understandthe complexities.''   Drexel filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors inFebruary in the aftermath of a junk bond market collapse and afailure to recover from its guilty plea to federal securitiesviolations.   Drexel still is liquidating its large securities portfolio anddrawing up, along with creditors, a reorganization plan.</TEXT></DOC>
