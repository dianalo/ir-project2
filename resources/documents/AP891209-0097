Cristiani's proposal, made on the eve of a summit of the fiveCentral American presidents, appeared to be a concession to get therebels back to the bargaining table.   He also offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to theconviction of the killers of six Jesuit priests and two others whowere slain Nov. 16.   Cristiani told a news conference his rightist government ``iswilling to renew the process of dialogue on condition the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front publicly pledges by Dec. 15 to endall terrorist actions that directly or indirectly affect thecivilian population.''   Since Cristiani began his five-year term as president on June 1,two rounds of truce talks in Mexico and Costa Rica have ended indeadlock because of government insistence that the rebels disarmimmediately and join El Salvador's political life.   Cristiani said Saturday that he did not expect the rebels tosurrender their weapons while talks are under way. ``If they wantto remain on San Salvador Volcano, that's all right, but theyshould not attack the civilian population,'' he said.   He said a meeting between his U.S.-backed government and rebelrepresentatives could be held in Caracas, Venezuela, to arrange acease-fire and negotiate peace by Feb. 15. The rebels then would beexpected to join the political process, Cristiani said.   ``When we speak of dialogue, obviously there are issues thathave to be negotiated and discussed, but the FMLN has positionsthat are absurd and others that can be discussed,'' he said,referring to the rebel organization by its Spanish initials.   If the rebels reject his proposal, the armed forces ``willcontinue to confront them militarily,'' he said.   The rebels have accused the government of not negotiating ingood faith.   They attacked the Defense Ministry compound in San Salvador withmortars in October, then canceled a third round of talks plannedfor Nov. 20-21 in Caracas when a leftist union hall and the officesof a human rights group were bombed, apparently in retaliation.   On Nov. 11, the rebels launched the fiercest offensive in theirdecade-old war. The offensive continued sporadically last week,mostly in the capital.   Attacks Friday cut power supplies in San Salvador and left thecity hall in flames in El Transito, 75 miles southeast of thecapital.   An estimated 2,000 people have been killed in the latest roundof fighting. More than 72,000 people, mostly civilians, have diedsince the war began.   ``Since Nov. 11 up to now, they (the rebels) have not attackedany military objective,'' only civilian targets, Cristiani said.   He guaranteed a $250,000 cash reward, safety and immunity foranyone providing information or evidence leading to the convictionof those responsible for killing the priests, their cook and herteen-age daughter.   Fellow Jesuits have said government soldiers entered theuniversity campus where the priests lived, roused them from bed,shot them to death and mutilated the bodies.   A maid at a nearby house, now in Florida for her own safety,claimed she saw the soldiers enter the Jesuits' house and heard theshots.   ``Any person or persons who, against their will or unwittingly,took part indirectly in this who provides relevant information thatcan clarify this crime, will be awarded (the money),'' Cristianisaid.   He said his government has asked for help from the FBI, ScotlandYard and police organizations in Spain and Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
