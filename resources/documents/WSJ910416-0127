Mr. Polo, whose whereabouts couldn't be determined, hadbeen ordered to pay $123.8 million to his former clients. ButMr. Polo has only about $12 million in assets available inthe U.S. And under a settlement approved last week by U.S.District Judge Charles Haight in Manhattan, $7 million willbe turned over to the IRS. The IRS was seeking a total of $36million, claiming that Mr. Polo owed income taxes on the $110million he allegedly embezzled from his clients.</LP><TEXT>   That leaves about $5 million for the investors. Most ofthe money comes from a court-ordered sale of paintings,jewelry and a Manhattan town house previously owned by Mr.Polo.   The investors sued Mr. Polo in 1988 for allegedly dippinginto their accounts to finance his own lavish life style. Theinvestors also are suing Mr. Polo in Paris and Geneva inattempts to recover some of his assets abroad.   Mr. Polo was ordered to pay the $123.8 million in adefault judgment in 1989. Proceeds from the sale of hisseized assets were held to satisfy the claims of theinvestors who sued.   Robert J. Reger Jr., an attorney for one of the groups ofinvestors suing Mr. Polo, said he expects investorseventually to recover much more from Mr. Polo. Mr. Reger, ofthe firm Reid andamp; Priest in Manhattan, said that antiques andjewelry valued at tens of millions of dollars are being heldin connection with the litigation in Europe.   An attorney for Mr. Polo couldn't be reached for comment.Mr. Polo, who courted clients from the jet set, has deniedany wrongdoing.   Mr. Reger and other attorneys in the case said theyhaven't been able to locate Mr. Polo. Mr. Reger said Mr. Polohasn't attended the court proceedings in Europe, although hehas been represented there by counsel and by his relatives.   &quot;Instead of presenting himself in court . . . he has sofar chosen to throw obstacles in the path of the people whomhe wronged,&quot; Mr. Reger said.   ---   FRAUD ACCUSATIONS against Posner should be dropped,magistrate rules.   Federal Magistrate Nina Gershon said that securities-fraudallegations against businessman Victor Posner should bedismissed in a class-action lawsuit over the failed sale ofFischbach Corp. in 1989. The magistrate, of U.S. districtcourt in Manhattan, also ruled that Fischbach shouldn't benamed as a defendant.   The class action alleged that Mr. Posner and Fischbachwere part of a scheme to violate the securities law anddefraud Fischbach investors. The alleged fraud stemmed from a$117 million proposed takeover of Fischbach by Britishinvestor Asher DeVere. The proposed takeover fell apart threemonths later because the purchasers couldn't attainfinancing, and the stock price of Fischbach tumbled. The suitsought unspecified total damages for investors who boughtFischbach shares between May 15, 1989, when the proposal wasfirst publicized, and Aug. 16, 1989, when the unavailabilityof financing was announced.   The suit, which also named Mr. DeVere and others asdefendants, claimed that Mr. Posner and Fischbach took partin the alleged scheme by issuing news releases about theproposed takeover. The lawsuit said Mr. Posner and Fischbach,of which he then owned 52.9%, had an obligation to provideinvestors with more information about the bidders' financingplans. Mr. Posner sold his stake in the New York-basedelectrical engineering company last year to AmericanInternational Group Inc., a New York-based insurer.   Magistrate Gershon, however, said the suit failed toallege any misstatements or omissions by Mr. Posner thatwould indicate any intent to defraud investors.   &quot;While the complaint makes boilerplate allegations offraud and knowledge of falsity against all of the defendants,plaintiffs offer no facts from which intentional fraud oractual knowledge of falsity on the part of {Mr. Posner andFischbach} can be inferred,&quot; the magistrate said. Herrecommendation and report will be sent to District JudgeKimba Wood, who is presiding over the Fischbach litigation.   Magistrate Gershon said that based on the allegations inthe complaint, Mr. Posner and the company &quot;were themselvesdefrauded by the other defendants.&quot;   Attorneys for Mr. DeVere couldn't immediately be reached.   ---   JUDGE WHO WAS OVERTURNED in Jim Bakker sentencing isrebuffed again.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, called &quot;Maximum Bob&quot; bymany lawyers because of the tough sentences he imposes, sentLouis Guglielmi to federal prison for 25 years in 1985. Mr.Guglielmi's crime: dispatching obscene films through themail. Under current federal sentencing guidelines, not thenin effect, the harshest sentence Mr. Guglielmi would get is14 months.   Responding to requests for a reduced sentence, the FourthU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., sent the caseback to Judge Potter for reconsideration three times, buteach time the judge sustained the sentence without adequatelyexplaining why. Last week, in a rare exercise of judicialpower, the Fourth Circuit took the case away from JudgePotter and remanded it to another judge not yet named. Thecourt said that Judge Potter, of Charlotte, N.C., had failedto &quot;exercise {his} discretion discernibly or meaningfully.&quot;   In a concurring opinion, appeals court Judge J. HarvieWilkinson 3rd issued a harsher assessment of Judge Potter'ssentence, calling it &quot;indeed idiosyncratic and beyond thescope of any legislative mandate.&quot;   Mr. Guglielmi's lawyer, Harvard University's AlanDershowitz, called Mr. Potter a &quot;very dangerous man on thebench.&quot; Mr. Dershowitz also handled Mr. Bakker's successfulappeal. &quot;Judge Potter doesn't understand the differencebetween a year and a decade,&quot; Mr. Dershowitz added.   Judge Potter declined to comment, as did Thomas J.Ashcraft, U.S. attorney in Charlotte, who had argued touphold the heavy sentence.   ---   NOTED: Rudolph C.
