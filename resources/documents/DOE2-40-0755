<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-0755 </DOCNO><TEXT>Semiconductor diode lasers remain the subject of intensive worldwide developmentefforts with rapid progress being made in many areas of device designand performance. In addition to their use in optical-fiber systems, otherapplications have been identified. This meeting treated all aspects oflaser design, development, and characterization. Laser and optical techniquesare increasingly important for diagnostics of a wide variety of materialsand processing technologies. Applications range from diagnostics of impuritiesand other defects in materials, to probes of dry-processing technologiesfor semiconductor device fabrication, to imaging techniques for patterningand analysis in VLSI manufacture. These techniques are being used bothfor analytic measurements and as tools to probe new materials and effects.This meeting brought together workers from all of these areas for theexchange of results and of new directions for research. Optical materialsare being applied in ever-more-stressing environmental conditions. Theresponse and durability of optical materials and coatings under the challengesposed by these environments can determine the overall success of manylarge-scale programs and of whole classes of optical devices. The purposeof this meeting is to bring together researchers with experience in allaspects (materials, design, fabrication, testing and performance) ofoptics in highly adverse environments for an exchange of results, techniquesand discussion of future research directions.</TEXT></DOC>
