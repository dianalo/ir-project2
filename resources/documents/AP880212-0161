(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Black andamp; Decker Corp. announced Friday that agroup of commercial banks has arranged $2.2 billion in financingfor the company's $2.1 billion hostile takeover attempt forAmerican Standard Inc.   The syndidate is composed of 19 domestic and foreign banks,including Chase Manhattan Bank, which earlier pledged $750 millionof its own funds toward the deal, the company said.   American Standard has vowed to fight Black andamp; Decker's$65-per-share bid, saying it will consider a restructuring,leveraged buyout or a friendly merger with another company. The NewYork-based manufacturer of plumbing, heating and air conditioningequipment has urged its shareholders to reject the offer and hasadopted a ``poison pill'' plan allowing shareholders to buy backtheir stock at half market value if the takeover succeeds.   Black andamp; Decker, which currently owns just 100 shares of thecompany, launched an effort Wednesday to oust American Standard'sboard of directors. Shareholders will be asked to vote their sharesto remove 10 members of the company's board, Black andamp; Decker said.One of the objectives, the suitor said, was to remove the poisonpill plan.   The Towson, Md.-based tool and appliance maker also announcedthe expiration of a waiting period under the Hart-Scott-RodinoAntitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The law required a 30-daycooling off period to check for possible antitrust violations.   ``The screening process is over and that means there are noantitrust implications,'' said Black andamp; Decker spokeswoman BarbaraLucas.   Mrs. Lucas said the agreements with the banks are for permanentfinancing of the takeover. Some of the $2.2 billion loan is forexpenses related to the deal, she said.   Black andamp; Decker launched its bid for American Standard on Jan. 28.</TEXT></DOC>
