The accord is a coup for Adobe, which is the dominantsupplier of printer and type software for personal computers.It also is a fresh example of Apple's new willingness to relyon outsiders for help with its products.</LP><TEXT>   In the past, Apple zealously adhered to an &quot;only inventedhere&quot; philosophy that sometimes limited the company. Over thepast 12 months, however, the computer maker has tried toshore up weak spots in its business by seeking aid fromothers. Last month, Apple made a tentative agreement todevelop software with International Business Machines Corp.In October, Apple is expected to sell for the first time acomputer it didn't manufacture itself -- a portable computermade by Sony Corp., a longtime Apple supplier.   The latest agreement, which is formally a letter ofintent, shows that Apple has come full circle in itsrelationship with Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif.Adobe's software, which controls the way typefaces arecreated by printers and displayed on computer screens, wasinstrumental in the computerization of publishing, and thecompany previously had support from Apple, which was thefirst big personal-computer company to incorporate Adobe'scode in its computer printers.   In 1989, Apple sold its 16.4% stake in Adobe and said itwould compete against the company by developing its ownversion of Adobe's product with Microsoft Corp., the biggestmaker of personal computer software. That action was seen asa major blow to Adobe because Apple then was Adobe's largestshareholder and customer, accounting for 28% of the company'srevenue in 1988.   But by this year, Apple had signed a fresh licensing pactwith Adobe, and Adobe scored a partial victory last year whenit signed a technology licensing pact with Apple. Morerecently, Microsoft pulled the plug on some of its efforts tocompete with Adobe.   Under the agreement, Apple said it will incorporateAdobe's Type 1 font software into future versions of itsMacintosh system software. The agreement also calls fordevelopment of software necessary to support the Adobe codeand for Apple to deliver the capability to handle Type 1fonts before release of the system software.   In national over-the-counter trading, Apple's shares werequoted at $51, up 50 cents, and Adobe's were at $48.75, down$1.50.</TEXT></DOC>
