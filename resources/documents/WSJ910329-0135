OSHA's allegations, which come from an investigation theagency undertook when a worker was accidentally killed at theplant this past autumn, include more than 100 citations forwillful safety violations at the site.</LP><TEXT>   The case against ConAgra's Monfort Inc. unit marks OSHA'sfirst use of so-called willful egregious claims under arecent regulation designed to protect workers who areservicing equipment.   OSHA has charged willful egregious violations in a varietyof other cases involving different work rules.   The agency said Monfort's Grand Island, Neb., plant &quot;hasbeen inspected by OSHA on different occasions and has not yetfully committed to improve or upgrade working conditions.&quot; AnOSHA spokesman in the Kansas City, Mo., office said theworker's death was the second at the plant in two years.   In Greeley, Colo., a Monfort spokesman said the companyhasn't yet completed a full review of the allegations, but&quot;from our initial review, we have determined that we willcontest the citations.&quot; He said Monfort is &quot;confident thatwhen we are given the opportunity for a full hearing on thesematters, that our commitment to safety and health will bevindicated.&quot;   Monfort has 15 working days to challenge the citations andproposed penalties.   The citations involve a plant where a maintenance workerwho was working on a hide-fleshing machine was killed inOctober, when the machine was accidentally switched on. A1989 OSHA standard requires that equipment being serviced beturned off or disconnected, and the switch to be eitherlocked or labeled with a warning tag; the provision, OSHA hassaid, could prevent about 120 deaths and as many as 60,000injuries yearly.   OSHA said its latest inspection of the Grand Island plantturned up &quot;disregard for lockout/tagout and machine guardingsafeguards.&quot; Monfort, OSHA said, &quot;was aware of&quot; the standard,but &quot;did not formulate a plan adequate to address existinghazards.&quot;   OSHA alleged 57 violations of machine guarding standards,18 instances of failure to abide by the lockout requirement,and assorted other training and safety violations. Themaximum penalty of $10,000 for each so-called willfulviolation was recently raised to $70,000 -- which could havemade Monfort liable for a considerably higher fine -- butOSHA couldn't seek the higher penalty because the agency'sinvestigation began before that law took effect this month.   ConAgra is based in Omaha, Neb.   Monfort's health and safety experience was an importantfocus of hearings last week by the House employmentsubcommittee. Several Monfort workers or their survivorstestified to deaths or injuries that occurred, for example,when machines were accidentally turned on as they worked onthe equipment. Others said they have suffered cripplinginjuries from frequent, fast production-line movements.   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.),and the United Food and Commercial Workers union criticizedOSHA's new policy of seeking voluntary agreements frommeatpackers to create programs to prevent workers' hand,wrist and arm injuries that result from those repeated workmotions. In return, OSHA, while monitoring the results ofsuch programs, will exempt the meatpackers from regularinspections for the so-called cumulative trauma disorders.OSHA defended the approach as the best use of its resourcesfor regulating meatpacking.</TEXT></DOC>
