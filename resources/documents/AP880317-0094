MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The beleaguered government announcedtoday it was taking over all public services a day after a failedcoup attempt by rebel officers sparked anti-government rioting bythousands of people.   Soldiers loyal to military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegapatrolled the streets after Wednesday's rampage by people fed upwith military rule and Panama's financial crisis.   The disturbances were the largest since civilian opponents beganstaging demonstrations calling for Noriega's ouster last summer.   Dressed in battle gear and armed with shotguns, sidearms, teargas cannisters and rubber truncheons, the soldiers were spreadthroughout the city and were on every corner in many areas.   The coup attempt Wednesday was led by Panama's police chief,Col. Leonidas Macias, but was quickly crushed.   The United States has been using economic and political pressureto try to force Noriega to step down as military leader and leavethe country. As head of the 15,000-member Panama Defense Forces,Noriega is the power behind the civilian government.   The government decree covered electric service, communications,ports, water services, airports, hospitals and the farm and dairyproducts marketing institute.   The decree said Defense Forces were instructed to ``cooperate''with the government agencies and insure that public order ismaintained.   Electric power shut off by striking workers Wednesday wasrestored early today, but then went off again.   Wednesday's protests erupted spontaneously throughout thecapital and in the country's second largest city, Colon, 50 milesto the north.   Security guards fired into crowds that ransacked stores and litbarricades of trash on fire in Panama City, but no deaths werereported.   By midafternoon, the demonstrators were dispersed, buses andtaxis stopped running and the city was virtually deserted, exceptfor patrolling soldiers.   The attempted coup was the first indication of opposition toNoriega within the Panama Defense Forces.   The coup attempt began an hour after dawn with the crackle oflight arms fire inside the walled Defense Forces headquarters inthe capital.   After eight hours of official silence, the Defense Forcesfinally acknowledged at midafternoon that a coup attempt had takenplace, blaming a handful of officers led by Macias.   A statement from the Defense Forces' press office said Macias,three majors and a captain were arrested and that the revolt wasput down ``without bloodshed.''   But Maj. Edgardo Lopez, head of the military press office, toldreporters that ``eight or 10 officers'' were involved in theaborted coup. He did not explain the discrepancy.   An hour after the shooting began, Noriega appeared at the top ofa stairway outside the headquarters building, dressed in civilianclothes and accompanied by members of his high command.   To shouted questions from reporters about what had happened, thegeneral replied: ``What has happened is that you are visiting ushere today.'   Asked about the shots, he replied: ``They were kisses.''   Despite official evasions, word of the coup attempt spread andpeople poured into streets of the capital that were strangelydevoid of riot police and soldiers.   Demonstrators erected flaming barricades of trash and debrisacross hundreds of streets, roughed up suspected governmentinformers and broke into stores believed to be owned by Noriega andhis supporters.   In the central business district, a mob of hundreds pushed aparked car through the plate-glass windows of a store they believedis owned by Noriega, then set the vehicle ablaze.   Security guards fired on the crowd from the building's upperwindows, but no one was injured. Flames destroyed the store.   By midday, unpaid workers at the state-owned utility joinedstrikes called earlier by teachers, health department and othergovernment employees. The entire nation was left withoutelectricity.   Noriega was indicted last month by two federal grand juries inFlorida on drug trafficking charges that link him to Colombia'sinfamous Medellin drug cartel. Spain formally offered him asylum.   Banks remained closed by government order for the 12th straightday on Wednesday. Most had closed days earlier because of a run ondeposits and the government's inability to provide them with cashto cover withdrawals.   The bank run began Feb. 26, when the Noriega-dominatedLegislative Assembly dismissed the nation's civilian, figureheadpresident, Eric Arturo Delvalle. The day before, Devalle hadordered Noriega to resign.   The United States has halted all military and economic aid toPanama and withheld $6.5 million in Panama Canal fees due this week.</TEXT></DOC>
