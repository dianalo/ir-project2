D'ALESSIO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Richard Wagner put him on the operatic stagein 1845, Tannhauser was a noble knight with one girlfriend too many_ the pagan goddess of love. Now, he's a television evangelist withthe same problem.   The goddess in Peter Sellars' production of ``Tannhauser,''which premiered Monday evening at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, livesin a sleazy Las Vegas motel and is attended by nymphs wearing onlytheir bikini tops for the first 90 seconds of Act 1.   Tannhauser himself, sung by tenor Richard Cassilly, bears acertain resemblance to the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart.   Tannhauser confesses to his sins of the flesh during a ceremonyat a crystal cathedral clearly modeled on the Rev. RobertSchuller's headquarters in California. In February, Swaggartconfessed to committing unspecified sins against his family andGod, while a prostitute maintained he had paid her to pose nude ina motel room.   In the play, Tannhauser achieves salvation by a miracleperformed at Los Angeles International Airport.   ``There will be a bunch of things on stage that people willreact to involuntarily,'' Sellars, 33, predicted in an interviewprinted in the program. ``I love making something just familiarenough and at the same time just strange enough that you feel athome enough to be caught off guard _ and to react without anypreconceived ideas.''   Despite angry letters to newspapers in weeks preceding thepremiere denouncing Sellars' modernization as ``anti-Wagnerian''and ``anti-Christian,'' no protesters picketed outside the operahouse.   Audience members noted that the histrionic gestures and languageoften used by television evangelists fit well with the high-flownWagnerian emotionalism of the libretto.   Sellars' translation of the libretto into ``modern American''evoked laughs during Tannhauser's Act 1 love scene with the goddessVenus.   Titles projected above the stage had Venus, sung by MarilynZschau, describing ``bodacious wonder'' and ``singing the blues,''and expressing such thoughts as ``Sing it baby, grab that harp!''   Act 2, however, was played seriously. As in Wagner's original,Tannhauser and other claimants compete in a contest of holy songfor the hand of the virtuous heroine, Elisabeth, portrayed byNadine Secunde.   Tannhauser, unfortunately, begins singing of the carnal love heenjoyed with Venus and is condemned as a sinner.   Some audience members said they found the televangelism analogya good one.   ``There's nothing in the modern age that fits an overblowncharacter like Tannhauser,'' said Matthew Vender Venn. ``It's gotto be a televangelist, or maybe Ollie North, if you really wantedto be silly.''   Others were a bit mixed in their reaction to the work bySellars, an avant garde impressario whose operatic triumphsincluded last year's ``Nixon in China.''   ``Peter Sellars is always an experience,'' said Dwight Casimere.``You know a given opera and you know where Sellars is coming from_ he tries to get a visceral reaction _ and you try to figure outhow it's going to fit together. To me, there are alwaysdiscrepancies. There are discrepancies tonight, but the music isgreat and the singing is great.''   Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, in Baton Rouge, La., had no commenton the performance.   ``I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about,''ministries spokeswoman Linda Westbrook said Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
