Bulk, X-ray powder patterns show the presence of siderite,rare plumbogummite minerals as well as common quartz and feldspar. TheFox Creek, McNeil Canyon and Ninilchik-Clam Gulch areas are characterizedby the presence of volcanic glass, minor halloysite and quartz-feldspar,respectively. Cluster analyses, using major oxide and trace element values,show that partings from McNeil Canyon and Fox Creek may correlate withpartings from the Ninilchik and Clam Gulch areas. SiO{sub 2} concentrationsare highest in the youngest parts of the sampled areas and lowest inthe oldest parts. For the Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, an opposite trend is observed.Detrital partings are characterized by high Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} content,which can be attributed to common siderite. Low Ti/Al ratios of 0.03-0.04are indicative of rhyolitic source volcanics for the ash partings. Traceelement concentrations of the younger partings approach the originalcomposition, with some depletion and some enrichment in the older partings.Most partings designated as volcanic contain one or more minerals characteristicof volcanic origin, as well as volcanic glass in various stages of transitionto clay. The altered glass can be recognized by its morphological features.41 references, 10 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
