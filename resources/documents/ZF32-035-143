Air Force.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Which rumors are worth reporting and which should be ignored?andM;In July, I reported in GCN that there was a movement afoot by some air Forceofficials to relocate the Standard Systems Center in Montgomery, Ala., toDayton, Ohio.andM;By itself, this was not news.andP;  For more than two years I had heard a stringof rumors about SSC being shifted -- here, there and everywhere.andP;  I neverreported any of those rumors; they were too flimsy.andM;But the July whispers were linked to the Air Force's continuing -- at timesit seemed eternal -- effort to produce an ADP consolidation plan as mandatedby the Defense Management Review.andM;Montgomery, as well as the Air Force Logistics Command in Dayton, were saidto be two 'sure things&quot; on a list that over a 10-month period had beenrumored to include as many as nine and as few as four sites.andM;But in August, the Air Force officially settled on five sites, includingMontgomery and Dayton.andM;Yet even before the Air Force made its consolidation plans known in August,Montgomery had been considered a likely hub center because Gunter Air ForceBase houses the Standard Systems Center, and SSC is the service's principalADP technology unit.andP;  Every line of standard software running in the AirForce is either developed, upgraded, evaluated, modified or, at least,approved by SSC officials.andM;The July rumor was worth reporting, I decided, because at that time officialsat some of the existing 75 ADP centers still were scrambling to get theirfacilities on the final Air Force list.andM;Uncertainty ContinuesandM;In July, I wrote that the Air Force still had not decided on the number ofsites and was juggling between four and six possibilities.andP;  I also wrote,&quot;Uncertainty about the exact number of centers might be related to a proposalto shift the location of the Standard Systems Center.&quot;andM;That sentence, of course, became moot in August when the Air Force producedits plan.andP;  Those who would have moved SSC obviously were overruled, it mightlogically be concluded.andP;  End of story?andM;Maybe, but it surely also was the beginning of a shaggy dog story.andP;  On Sept.andO;12, two Montgomery newspapers called wanting to interview me about my Julyreport.andP;  Reporters interviewing a reporter?andP;  It seems that Rep.andP;  WilliamDickinson (R-Ala.), the Montgomery congressman, had read the July 8 GCN anddialed the Air Force.andP;  So had the Montgomery papers.andM;&quot;I called Air Force public affairs, and they told me they know of no proposalby anyone to move SSC,&quot; a reporter told me.andM;Shocking stuff.andP;  Nothing like being told you got your story all wrong.andP;  Butwas it?andM;Among other episodes, I am reminded of my yearlong quest for the final wordon the Army's Information Systems Command, another DMR casualty.andP;  During thatslog, I was told continually that there was no official plan or proposal thatwould cut ISC's size and clout in half, despite persistent rumors to thecontrary.andM;Finally, this spring, a memo from the Army chief of staff ordered a massivereduction in ISC that he said was supported by studies and plans that, ofcourse, had not existed until his memo arrived.andM;The Montgomery press eventually reported that Dickinson found nothing tosupport rumors of an SSC move.andP;  This is good news for Montgomery's localeconomy, which would be boosted further by reports confirming that no one hasever proposed moving SSC and that no one ever will propose moving it.andM;Shaggy dog stories usually come and go without underlying morals.andP;  I'm notsure there are any lessons implied in this one.andP;  Rumors get reported in partbecause official information is lacking or non-existent.andM;In July I also wrote that officials privately said the consolidation planningwas dominated by political considerations as a result of pressures beingapplied on the Air Force from Capitol Hill.andM;Pinning Down FactsandM;After the story ran, an Air Force Pentagon official called and said there wasno political pressure.andP;  In fact, she said my story was &quot;75 percentinaccurate.&quot;andP;  When I asked which 75 percent, she answered, &quot;I'm notauthorized to talk about that.&quot;andM;Was it a mistake to report the SSC rumor?andP;  If so, it would seem comparable toone that Yossarian, the protagonist of Joseph Heller's World War II novel,Catch-22, made.andM;When he asked to be relieved from flying bombing missions, he was told hecould get out of flying only if he was found to be insane.andP;  But, he was alsotold, only an insane person would want to fly the missions.andP;  Asking out thusguaranteed he would stay in.andM;So perhaps I owe the Air Force this much of a retraction: Was there aproposal to move SSC?andP;  Forget it.andP;  No way.andP;  Insane.andM;Robert Green, who covered Defense Department computing as a GCN reporter, isa free-lance writer in Baltimore.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
