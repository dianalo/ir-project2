Frederick D. Wolf, director of the finance division of thecongressional watchdog agency, said he now estimates the cost ofeliminating insolvent Sandamp;Ls at $45 billion to $50 billion, up fromthe $26 billion to $36 billion estimated by the agency in May.Private analysts have estimated the cost will hit $80 billion ormore.   Moreover, Wolf said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's revenueprojections are ``highly optimistic,'' adding ``there is a stronglikelihood they will prove incorrect.''   He testified to the House Banking Committee on Thursday asdebate intensified over whether taxpayer money will be needed tobail out the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which isfunded currently by an assessment on the Sandamp;L industry.   ``At this point, I would say flat out that Congress is going tohave to do this. FSLIC resources under any conceivable scenariowill not be adequate,'' he said.   The latest estimate of red ink by the bank board, whichregulates 3,000 Sandamp;Ls, is $31 billion, well within the agency's $42billion projection of its revenue over the next 10 years.   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall last week promised to releasean updated cost estimate after the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.   A private consultant, Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va., told thecommittee that the bank board already has committed itself to spendmore in aid to insolvent Sandamp;Ls in the form of promissory notes orguarantees against loss than it can pay for through the premiumscollected from healthy institutions.   Wolf, Ely and Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman ofthe committee, called on the bank board to issue more realisticprojections.   ``There's no question that getting it all on the table is thefirst requisite to dealing with the problem. Until the bank boardis more willing or able to lay out the problems, it's going tofester,'' Wolf said.   St Germain said, ``The bank board's shifting tote board is doingnothing to enhance confidence.''   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said, ``We willcontinue to be, as we have been, forthcoming with the numbers as wederive them.''   Hoyle also said bank board revenue projections are conservativebecause they do not include any return from the agency's ownershipstake in rescued institutions.   Wolf and Ely criticized many of the transactions in a spate ofrescues _ $13 billion worth over the last month _ as thin dealsthat bring little new private money to ailing institutions.   ``Merging several insolvent institutions into a larger entitywhich remains thinly capitalized does not necessarily represent afinal resolution,'' Wolf said. ``Whether or not such institutionscan become viable entities without further assistance remains to beseen.''</TEXT></DOC>
