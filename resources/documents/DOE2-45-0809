The chlorofluorocarbons accumulatedin the troposphere gradually flow into the stratosphere by diffusion.Even stable CCl{sub 2}F{sub 2} and CCl{sub 3}F are photolytically degradedby the strong solar ultraviolet rays in the troposphere to produce chlorineatoms, which decompose ozone. Since the chlorine atoms are regenerated,a chain reaction decomposing ozone continuously proceeds. Consideringthat ozone plays roles as the filter for the ultraviolet rays and theheat source of the stratosphere, the environmental effects caused bythe decomposition of ozone in the stratosphere such as the increase ofthe intensity of ultraviolet rays on the earth and the temperature decreasein the upper part of stratosphere are anticipated. The greenhouse effectby Freon is anticipated from the existence of the ozone hole with a decreasedamount of ozone over the South Pole. (5 figs. 13 refs.)</TEXT></DOC>
