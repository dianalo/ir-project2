Government party officials said they would ask President RohTae-woo to veto the laws approved by the opposition-controlledlegislature. The proposals were passed 164-125, with threeabsentions.   If vetoed, the bills likely would die because the oppositionlacks the two-thirds legislative majority needed to override apresidential veto. South Korea's three predominant oppositionparties together control 166 seats in the 299-member NationalAssembly.   The governing Democratic Justice Party criticized the proposalsand said Roh would certainly veto them. Party officials argued thebills are unconstitutional.   ``It is highly regrettable that the opposition rammed the lawbills through the Assembly in disregard of our repeated warningsthat they would be vetoed,'' Democratic Justice Party floor leaderKim Yoon-hwan said.   Kim Won-ki, floor leader for the Party for Peace and Democracy,the largest opposition group, said he doubted Roh would veto thebills.   ``I don't think President Roh would veto the bills. He hasrepeatedly promised that there would be no sanctuary ininvestigating past corruption and irregularities,'' the oppositionleader said.   The legislation contains a provision that empowers the NationalAssembly to subpoena witnesses with writs of arraignment issued bycourts of law.   Opposition politicians said such a law is needed to compel allwitnesses to testify in South Korea's huge government corruptioncase.   They said privately that the main targets of the laws are Chunand his family.   Roh and other top government officials maintain that they wouldsupport efforts to ferret out all past corruption andirregularities under Chun but the president oppose any moves tomake the Chun testify or stand trial.   Chun, whose term ended in February, has come under public firefor alleged involvement in large-scale financial scandals. One ofhis brothers, Chun Kyung-hwan, was arrested in March for embezzlingmillions of dollars.   Several parliamentary committees were organized this week tolook into alleged corruption and other problems under Chun.   One committee is charged with probing a 1980 anti-governmentuprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left nearly 200 deadand more than 800 others injured, according to official count.   Opposition and dissident groups allege that Chun, along with Rohand the United States, helped mastermind the brutal suppression ofthe uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
