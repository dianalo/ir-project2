RJR's stock surged Monday, one day after its directors prolongedan unprecedented auction for the food-and-tobacco giant, reflectingtheir belief that even the priciest proposal _ valued at $26.58billion _ is too cheap.   Separately, the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., akey bidder for the company, indicated it would remain in contentionby extending its current tender offer for RJR Nabisco stock.   To some securities analysts following the deal, the maneuveringamounts to a spectacular guessing game in which it is difficult toaccurately value any of the bids or sense which direction thebiggest takeover saga ever would take next.   ``This is not regular analysis; this is guessing,'' said EmanuelGoldman, who follows RJR Nabisco for PaineWebber Group Inc. ``Whoknows what's going to happen. These are uncharted waters.''   Part of the problem that the offers include securities that aredifficult to price, making it harder to value the entire package,some analysts said.   ``These are `cash and trash,' as they say,'' said John Maxwell,who follows RJR Nabisco for the Richmond, Va. firm Wheat, FirstSecurities. ``You don't know how much the trash is worth until theyget it defined for you.''   A special committee of RJR Nabisco directors had givenprospective bidders until last Friday to present proposals forbuying the company, maker of hundreds of consumer items ranging fromWinston cigarettes to Planter's peanuts and Oreo cookies.   The directors received three bids and tried to evaluate them in amarathon weekend number-crunching session, but on Sunday nightextended the auction until Nov. 29 to give bidders time to amendtheir proposals and allow any new contenders to submit rival offers.   That move reflected the directors' view that the unprecedentedauction process required more time and that possibly higher offerscould emerge.   Wall Street speculators reacted by bidding RJR Nabisco stock up$1.87{ a share to $85.87{ Monday in heavy New York Stock Exchangetrading, leaving the price nearly 54 percent higher than when thetakeover battle began last month.   As of Monday these were the contenders:   _Senior RJR Nabisco managers backed by the investment firmsShearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Inc., offering a package ofcash and securities they valued at $100 a share, or $22.53 billion,for the company's 225.3 million shares outstanding.   _Kohlberg Kravis, backed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. andMerrill Lynch andamp; Co., offering a package of cash and securities theyvalued at $94 a share, or $21.17 billion.   _First Boston Corp. and Resource Holdings Inc., an investmentconcern led by the Pritzker family of Chicago and Anschutz family ofDenver, saying they could offer a package of cash and securitiesthey valued at between $105 to $118 a share, or $23.65 billion to$26.58 billion.   Although the First Boston proposal looked the fattest, it was apreliminary proposal that was vaguer than the others and structuredto take place over an extended period of time, rather than in asingle transaction that would provide shareholders immediate payment.   Before last Friday, the management group had offered $92 a sharein cash and securities, or $20.7 billion. The Kohlberg Kravis grouphad made a tender offer directly to shareholders of $90 a share incash and securities, or $20.3 billion.   Kohlberg Kravis has argued its latest proposal was superiorbecause the firm can simply and easily amend its earlier tenderoffer to reflect the higher $94-a-share price, speeding the paymentto stockholders by bypassing potentially time-consuming regulatoryobstacles that rival offers may face.   Kohlberg Kravis on Monday extended the tender offer expirationdate from this Friday to Dec. 13, thereby keeping the structure ofthat offer in place in case it wins the bidding contest.</TEXT></DOC>
