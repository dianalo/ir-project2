 This time I want to look briefly at desktop publishing on theMacintosh and then look at the issues surrounding one product -- Visionary --in a little more detail.andM;I mentioned in issue 129 that Microsoft and Apple are embarking on a UKroadshow promoting each other's products.andP;  The motive for this exercise is tointroduce the Macintosh as a viable PC alternative.andP;  The success of desktoppublishing on the Macintosh has tended to confine the machine to designdepartments, leaving PC users inclined to regard it as a West Coast gimmick.andM;Pared down to its essentials, the roadshow is an exercise to challenge thatimage and, of course, to introduce Apple to Microsoft customer base.andM;Alongside this is Microsoft's determination to construct a product line basedaround what it calls 'core technologies'.andP;  What that means is the company'sprogrammers construct a core engine for a product like Microsoft Word, andthen tart it up for Windows or the Macintosh or for the text-based MicrosoftWord 5.0.andP;  Of course, there's rather more to this than just tarting up, butthe essence is to prepare something that can be shifted from one platform toanother without too much trouble.andP;  It's one of the ways that Apple andMicrosoft can catch those PC users who've yet to succumb to the lure of theApple Macintosh.andM;Significantly though, one area th at Microsoft doesn't currently compete inis the one that made the Macintosh, and where it still -- if you'll excusethe expression -- excels.andP;  DTP made the Macintosh revolution work, and it'sstill the area where most PC users get their first glimpse of the machine.andM;Recent advances on the PC have meant that it's nowhere near the lame duck itused to be when it comes to combining printed words and photographs on thescreen and on to the page.andP;  But despite the sophistication of VenturaPublisher Professional Extension or Advent's 3B2, there's no getting awayfrom the fact that the Macintosh has a massive head start on this kind ofstuff plus an interface which makes sense to a lot of designers and layoutartists.andM;DTP packages on the Macintosh tend to tusssle for the position of top dog(er....top gun) but one that consistently appears near the top of the tableis QuarkXpress.andP;  It's a mainstream DTP program that supports colour andoffers good font manipulation and style editing.andP;  It also -- and necessarilyat this level -- produces PostScript files which can be 'RIPped' in to one ofthe big professional typesetting systems through a Raster Image Processor(RIP).andM;This is where desktop publishing starts to knock on the door of professionalcolour reproduction houses, and where users start to wonder just how far theycan -- and want to -- take office technology into the world of print andpublishing.andM;For those who want to go this route, Visionary is an interesting option.andO;It's a product produced jointly by Scitex (which makes large and expensiverepro machines) and Quark which makes Xpress.andP;  First off, it's important tounderstand that Visionary only makes sense if your colour house is alreadyusing Scitex kit.andP;  That's because the main enhancement Visionary offers overordinary Quark Xpress is the ability to translate files into a format thatthe big Scitex machines can understand.andP;  This means you can construct a setupwith a large format screen Macintosh (designers prefer bigger screens and thecolors are truer) with a Sharp A3 low-resolution scanner on the front-end anda cheapish (7,000 pounds) colour printer at the back for producingfour-colour proofs.andP;  The Macintosh is thus turned into an advanced proofingstation, producing sophisticated colour 'roughs' of page proofs which includemixed text and graphics as well as technical cropping and scalinginformation.andM;Once you've finished, the whole lot is compressed and passed to the Scitexsystem for fine adjustments and finishing.andP;  Visionary is currently being usedby The Independent Magazine and GolfWorld.andM;The pricing issue is a sensitive and complex one.andP;  Experience suggests thatScitex repro houses tend to charge a premium price for their services in thefirst place and any cost savings should be seen against that background.andP;  Asa guide, Ray Hammond, managing director of Visionary's Uk supplier The LastWord, suggests that the product only makes sense if your annual reproductioncosts are more than 250,000 pounds.andM;Others would argue that it also only makes sense if you want closer ties withyour colour house rather than more flexible ones.andP;  Any kind of publishing isfull of dependence and connections (at PC User we're linked to a typesetterwhich takes our Ventura Publisher files and then outputs them via Pubset) butwith copies of Visionary costing 5,000 pounds a shot without the hardware,it's a not inconsiderable investment.andM;Some in-house print and colour buyers I've spoken to consider systems likeVisionary to be a dead end.andP;  They admire the technology but argue that ifyou're serious about publishing you should be looking to replace your colourhouse and bring the facilities in-house.andM;Others hold the view that this white heat of technology stuff is far moretrouble and expense than it's worth, and that professional colour repro isstill too complex and should stay in the hands of the professionals.andM;There's one interesting point to note.andP;  About halfway down the first columnof the bright and sophisticated flyer that The Last Word has produced topromote Visionary there's a curious thing: half a dozen tiny black lines arecut above and below the copy.andP;  Lines that look suspiciously likecut-and-paste scalpel marks.andM;The Last Word is on (01) 736 7656</TEXT></DOC>
