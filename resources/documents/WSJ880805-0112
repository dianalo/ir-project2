Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> CNG SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A House subcommittee approved a bill that would substantially increase the penalties for insider trading.    The bill, cleared on a voice vote by the Energy and Commerce finance subcommittee, also would give the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to seek fines from firms for failing to properly supervise employees who engage in insider trading, and for failing generally to monitor for violations of securities laws.    Currently, the SEC can require the disgorgement of profits a firm makes as a result of an employee's insider trading, and can take such actions as barring people from the securities industry and asking courts to issue orders not to violate securities law. But the agency isn't able to ask courts to impose fines against firms in such cases.    An unrelated amendment to the bill, concerning the obscure but thorny issue of the multiple trading of options, was withdrawn after the SEC assured lawmakers that any changes it decides on won't be enacted before June of next year.    The full Energy and Commerce Committee probably will pass the bill next week without substantial changes, Democratic and Republican aides said. Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) has long opposed any legislative definition of insider trading, and in keeping with the powerful chairman's wishes, the bill doesn't offer a definition.    But the bill faces a less certain future on the Senate side. The Senate Banking Committee lately has focused on the problems of the thrift industry and on revising the law that separates commercial banking from investment banking. If it acts on insider trading this year, it is likely to do so only in late September or early October, when just a few days will be left in the current legislative session.    The bill would not only increase the penalties that can be sought by the SEC, which can take only civil actions, but also would boost the amount of criminal fines and criminal sentences that can be imposed for insider trading.    It calls for the maximum criminal fine for individuals to be increased to $1 million from $100,000, and the top fine for corporations and partnerships to rise to $2.5 million from $500,000. In addition, an amendment to the bill introduced by subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey (D., Mass.) and approved by voice vote would double the maximum jail term to 10 years.    The bill also establishes for the first time the payment of bounties to informants. Under this unusual provision, the SEC would have the authority to pay those providing information about insider trading as much as 10% of the penalty imposed or the settlement reached.    The bill also directs the SEC to establish a panel of experts to report on several issues, including the extent of insider trading and the adequacy of surveillance methods and of cooperation between various securities-enforcement authorities. The bill would give the panel subpoena powers and appropriate $5 million to fund it.    But the bill didn't include a draft amendment that would have prevented the SEC from taking any action on the multiple listing of options for two years. The long-running debate on the multiple listing of options contracts on exchange-listed issues has aroused some regional exchanges, some of which fear that their viability could be threatened if the SEC immediately allowed wide-open competition in options trading.    Rep. Mike Synar withdrew the amendment after receiving reassurances from SEC Chairman David Ruder that the agency won't carry out multiple options trading before June 1989. The Oklahoma Democrat later released a letter from Mr. Ruder stating that the SEC currently expects to consider the issue in October or November.    &quot;If the rule (allowing competitive options listings) is adopted at that time,&quot; Mr. Ruder's letter said, &quot;the effective date of the rule will be postponed until June 1, 1989, in order to give the industry time to prepare for implementation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
