Several days ago scientists from a small biotechnologycompany in Vacaville, Calif., Biosource Genetics Corp.,sprayed the plants with a virus that infects only tobacco andthat, until now, had been considered a nuisance. Thegenetically engineered virus infected each plant, carryingwith it a new gene that never before had functioned in atobacco plant.</LP><TEXT>   At the moment, the new virus-inserted genes are spreadingthrough the leaves, stems and stalks of the tobacco plants.In about six weeks the Biosource researchers plan to harvestthe plants, grind them up and put them through a chemicalextraction process.   If the inserted genes function as well in the field testas they did in the greenhouse, the researchers will extractfrom some of the plants a bountiful supply of trichosanthin,a drug better known as &quot;compound Q&quot; that now is in finalstages of testing in patients with acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome, or AIDS. Other plants should yield alpha amylase,an enzyme used by food processors, brewers and others toconvert starches to sugars.   Still other tobacco plants should yield supplies of twohuman proteins. Company researchers declined to say whichhuman proteins, but earlier reports in scientific journalsindicated the company probably would try to insert the genesfor the alpha and beta portions of human hemoglobin, theoxygen-carrying protein in human blood. A number ofbiotechnology companies are trying various geneticengineering approaches with bacteria and other microbes toproduce human hemoglobin for use in blood substitutes and toboost the effectiveness of radiation in destroying cancers.Biosource apparently is the only company attempting to getplants to make human hemoglobin.   The new technology, dubbed Geneware by the company, shouldcreate a new source for medicinal and industrial chemicals aswell as prove to be a boon for tobacco farmers who are seeingdemand for their crop drop steadily.   &quot;The system will allow tobacco farmers to have widermarket opportunities since they will be able to contracttheir crops to companies that use the Geneware system to makecommercial products in tobacco plants,&quot; said Robert L. Irwin,Biosource president.   Many biotechnology companies are attempting to insert newgenes into plants to make them resistant to chemicals,insects and drought and to improve their yields. But in mostcases the researchers are trying to insert the new genes intothe plants' germ cells. This means that the new gene ispassed on to succeeding generations through the seed orpollen.   In contrast, the Biosource scientists are inserting newgenes into plants that have already sprouted. The new genespreads through the plant, causing tissues throughout theplant to produce new proteins, but when the plant dies, thenew gene dies with it.   Biosource quietly began the field test 10 days agoimmediately after the test was approved by the state'sGenetic Engineering Review Board, an arm of the NorthCarolina Department of Agriculture, in one of the firstattempts by a state to regulate agriculture biotechnology.Environmental groups had appealed to the review board,composed of representatives of various government, public andindustrial groups, to hold up approval of Biosource'sapplication to begin the field test.   The review board approved the field test by a vote of 7-1,Laurence K. Grill, Biosource vice president for research,said. The field test also was approved by the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture.   The environmental groups appealed largely because theyfelt Biosource hadn't provided sufficient data on the safetyof the field test rather than out of any specific knowledgeof possible risk, said Allen Spalt, director of theAgriculture Resource Center in Carrboro, N.C., one of thegroups that sought the review. At the hearings, he said,state and federal agricultural officials themselves presentedinformation about the safety of the test that &quot;made us feelsomewhat better about the risk of the test. But we don't feelany better about the approval and review process.&quot;   &quot;The Geneware system has no negative environmental impactsince it is easily controlled and isn't inherited bysubsequent generations of plants,&quot; Mr. Grill said.   The virus used to insert new genes into the plants is thetobacco mosaic virus, which selectively infects tobaccoplants and causes damage to leaves that resembles a mosaicpattern. The virus already is endemic in the U.S. tobaccocrop.   The virus isn't carried by insects and doesn't appear inthe pollen of the plant. It is spread only by farm workers asthey periodically go through a field plucking off matureleaves, Mr. Grill explained. The chance of a farm workerspreading the genetically altered virus to neighboringtobacco fields is extremely small as the farm workers wouldtouch the chemical-producing plants far less than they handletobacco plants grown for smoking. If necessary, he said,gloves and farm machinery can easily be sterilized withordinary bleach.   The &quot;foreign&quot; gene carried by a tobacco plant dies offwhen the plant is harvested and dies and doesn't persist inthe soil. In fact, Mr. Grill said, Biosource hopes to makeits money by selling new supplies of the virus each growingseason.   The genetically altered virus needs to be sprayed onto asmall cut in only one leaf of a plant. The virus infects aplant cell by inserting its genes and the added gene into thecell's genetic apparatus. The cell then begins churning outthe protein specified by the added gene. The genes also arerelayed to neighboring cells until cells throughout theentire plant are making the protein specified by the addedgene.   If the field test is successful, Biosource plans to testinsertion of other commercially important genes into tobaccoplants and then build a processing plant in North Carolina toextract the proteins from harvested tobacco plants.</TEXT></DOC>
