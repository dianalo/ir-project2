The 1.9 percent January decline in construction of single-familyhomes and apartments, reported by the Commerce Department, raisednew concerns among some economists about the possibility of arecession this year.   However, other analysts pointed to a second government reportshowing that industrial production rose for the fourth consecutivemonth in January. The 0.2 percent rise in industrial outputfollowed larger gains of 0.4 percent in both November and December.   Economists are looking for continued strength in manufacturing,bolstered by rising export sales, to offset expected weakness inthe consumer sector.   The January decline in housing construction followed an evenlarger 15.5 percent December plunge and pushed building activitydown to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million units,the slowest pace since a rate of 1.30 million units in December1982, just as the last recession was ending.   Housing is being watched very closely in the aftermath of therecord 508-point drop in the stock market last October because itis often one of the first sectors to weaken at the onset of a newrecession.   Economists said the two consecutive monthly declines in housingconstruction did not guarantee a recession, especially since othereconomic sectors have been showing strength. But analysts saidfurther weakness in this important industry would be troubling.   ``If housing continues to weaken, it would obviously increasethe chances of a recession,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, head of theWEFA Group, formerly Wharton Econometrics. ``The rise in exportswould not be enough to offset a big drop in housing and consumerspending. A lot will depend on what happens in the next fewmonths.''   ``The weakness suggests that people have been scared by thestock market crash and are unwilling to take on the commitment of ahome mortgage,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data ResourcesInc. of Lexington, Mass.   Other analysts said that unusually severe January weather hadcontributed to the decline in starts last month and they predictedbetter figures in coming months, particularly in view of the factthat mortgage rates have been dropping in recent weeks.   Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages have fallen to a nationwideaverage of 9.84 percent, down almost a full percentage point sinceJan. 1 and the first time they have been in single-digits sincelast April.   ``We expect housing starts will pick up in February and March.Interest rates are lower and consumer confidence and employmenthave both strengthened,'' said Warren Lasko, executive vicepresident of the Mortgage Bankers Association.   The weakness last month came from a 2.9 percent decline inconstruction of single-family homes, which fell to an annual rateof 1.01 million units.   This drop offset a 0.8 percent increase in construction ofmulti-family housing, which edged up to an annual rate of 366,000units. That was still 35 percent below the level of activity in theapartment sector a year ago. Activity in the apartment sectorreflects a slump that followed enactment of the new tax law, whichremoved many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in realestate.   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association ofHome Builders, said that a rate of single-family starts above 1million still reflected strength in that sector, but he said theoverall industry was being held back by the prolonged slump inapartment activity.   He said multi-family construction is likely to fall further,especially in the South, where vacancy rates are high.   In January, construction starts fell 17.1 percent in the Southto an annual rate of 469,000 units. Starts were down an even larger21.8 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of 223,000 units.   Two other regions showed strength, however. Starts rose 27.6percent in the Northeast to an annual rate of 291,000 units andwere up 21.2 percent in the West to a rate of 394,000 units.   Building permits, considered a good sign of future activity,fell 8.2 percent in January to an annual rate of 1.25 millionunits, the lowest level for permits since January 1985. Permits hadfallen 7.4 percent in December.   The Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial productionshowed the January strength came from production of non-durablegoods, which rose 0.4 percent. Production of durable goods, itemsexpected to last three years, showed no increase last month as abig drop in auto and steel production offset increases in theoutput of light trucks and defense equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
