The definition of interaction depends on themeasure of association under consideration and can be expressed in termsof disease risk, time, or dose. Simple descriptive methods and maximumlikelihood model fitting methods are presented for analyzing interactionsin terms of joint effects on disease risk. Methods for assessing theinfluence of exposures on times to disease, using appropriate denominators,are also described. The various approaches are illustrated with publisheddata on lung cancer in relation to asbestos, radon daughters, chloromethylethers, and arsenic. Some of the mechanisms that can be invoked to explainthe observed patterns include initiation and promotion, lung clearance,transport across cell membranes, and mucous secretion.</TEXT></DOC>
