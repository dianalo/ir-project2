The raging Santa Catarina River engulfed cars, crushed housesand flooded large areas of this industrial city of 3 million about110 miles from the Texas border. Much of Monterrey was withoutpower and drinking water and the airport was closed.   Gov. Jorge Trevino Martinez declared the state of Nuevo Leon adisaster area.   ``It was a terrible thing, the worst thing that could havehappened here,'' said his spokesman, Geraldo Castro. ``Thisdisaster is unprecedented in the state.''   The hurricane, the strongest on record, was downgraded to atropical depression Saturday after leaving at least 100 otherpeople dead across the Caribbean, Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula andTexas.   Castro said there were at least 200 people aboard the fourbuses. ``I don't think many of them could have escaped,'' he said.Red Cross spokesman Adelberto Salas said only 13 people aboard thebuses were saved.   Castro said some 20,000 people in the state were homeless,12,000 of them in Monterrey.   ``We all left with only the clothes on our backs,'' VictorioCruz said as he picked through mud, gravel and the cement blockswhere his two-room house had stood.   Flood waters began to recede late Saturday but the current inthe Santa Catarina was too strong for a search for bodies.   Trevino told a news conference the bodies ``are buried in mud.If there are people inside (the buses), they are dead.''   He said a total of 60 bodies had been recovered in Monterrey anddownstream Saturday but a ``considerable number'' of people werestill missing.   ``The current carried more bodies but we don't how many thereare,'' said Coroner Juventio Guerrero in the suburban township ofGuadalupe.   Four policemen were swept to their deaths trying to rescue thebus passengers, said Comandante Antulio Alejo, commander of theCobra police unit. The National Civil Defense System in Mexico Citysaid two volunteers helping the police officers were missing.   Alejo also said that at the same spot ``There are several carsburied there also and we understand that some bodies are still insome of the cars.''   Weather stations reported that Hurricane Gilbert, during a28-hour period beginning Friday and ending Saturday morning, poured12 inches of rain on Monterrey.   As the water began to subside Saturday afternoon the wheels andchassis of one overturned bus could be seen. The vehicle was buriedup to the wheels by mud and rocks.   Nearby and partially buried were construction machines and othervehicles that had been carried by the raging waters into the river.   Eduardo Pichardo, an employee of Transportes Frontera inMonterrey, said about 64 people were aboard the two buses from hiscompany. He said one bus was en route to Monterrey from the bordercity of Nuevo Laredo and the other was on a run from Monterrey toMexico City.   Police said the buses were coming from the direction ofSaltillo, about 55 miles west of Monterrey. Saltillo, a city ofabout 450,000, is the capital of neighboring Coahuila state. Policesaid the buses probably had been diverted from their originalroutes because of flooded roads.   They said rising water stranded the buses on a low-lying stretchof road parallel to the river. As a special police unit, theCobras, tried to rescue the passengers, the current increased, thewater rose and the buses overturned.   Downstream from Monterrey, bodies were being recovered from theriver, police said.   The bodies of an elderly woman, a small boy and two men, allunidentified, were found in the town of Juarez 14 miles east ofMonterrey, said federal police spokesman Felipe de Jesus BandaMartinez.   In Cadereyta, 20 miles east of Monterrey, a police spokesmansaid another ``eight or ten bodies have been pulled out of theriver.''   At noon EDT Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in CoralGables, Fla. issued its final advisory on Gilbert.   It said the center of the storm was near latitude 25.5 north andlongitude 101.0 west or about 220 miles west southwest ofBrownsville, Texas, and 45 miles southwest of Monterrey.   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 35 mph and thestorm was expected to weaken further. But rainfall of 10 to 15inches was forecast, with up to 20 inches in some areas.   It was the second time in three days that Gilbert slammed intoMexico.   The storm hit the Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday and killed atleast 29 people after leaving 69 people dead in the Caribbean.   Gilbert, which turned into a hurricane Sept. 10, killed 26 inJamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in the Dominican Republic and eight inHonduras.   The storm at one point packed sustained winds of 175 mph and hadgusts of more than 200 mph. It was the most intense storm on recordin terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.13,breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane thatdevastated the Florida Keys.   The storm left 500,000 homeless and caused $8 billion in damagein Jamaica. In Haiti, the military government declared a state ofemergency in three southern regions, where 50 to 60 percent of theagricultural production was destroyed.   The storm left the eastern Yucatan resort of Cancun in shambles.About 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan state and 10,000 morehomeless in Campeche, on the west coast of the peninsula, saidNotimex, the Mexican news agency.   Gilbert stranded 8,000 tourists in Cancun and Cozumel, left muchof the peninsula without power or communications and causedhundreds of millions of dollars in damage.   The storm came ashore again Friday afternoon along a sparselypopulated stretch of the Gulf of Mexico coast south of Matamoros.   It quickly began to dissipate into torrential rains and highwinds that drenched the northeastern states of Tamaulipas, NuevoLeon and Coahuila.   In Texas, heavy rains fell on Brownsville, with gusts up to 82mph recorded at nearby Padre Island, but the vulnerable coastalarea escaped the worst of the storm.   A woman was killed Saturday morning when a tornado hit hermobile home in Bexar County, Texas. A second person died in SanAntonio when a utility pole crashed into a house.</TEXT></DOC>
