A new-look opposition Labor Party launched a program itsaid &quot;would get Britain working again&quot; with tax breaks forcapital investment, higher spending and a government that&quot;business can do business with.&quot; In a slick presentation thatcontrasted with the party's previous left-wing stance, Laborproduced an election platform that never mentions the word&quot;socialism.&quot; Instead, the party says it has abandonedpolicies of massive renationalization and unilateral nucleardisarmament in favor of a vision of government whose missionis &quot;not to replace the market, but to ensure the market worksproperly.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The party that once promised &quot;full employment&quot; now pledgesonly to seek to curb &quot;excessive&quot; unemployment. &quot;We refuse togive the impression that there is some magic lever to pull,&quot;said Labor leader Neil Kinnock.   Still, Labor is making promises that would be tough todeliver on, like pulling Britain out of a world-widerecession, while trying to pin the blame on the ruling Toriesfor allowing the recession in the first place.   Labor said it would introduce a minimum wage and raisetaxes on middle-class and wealthy Britons; the party said itwould use the tax proceeds for nearly #2 billion ($3.47billion) of extra spending on the health service, educationand training for the unemployed.   Meantime, the Tories are offering more of the policiesthat have kept them in power for 13 years.   The Conservative platform promises to continue cuttingtaxes to a base rate of 20%. The Tories also plan to continueprivatization with the sales of British Coal, the LondonDocklands train service and pieces of British Rail, and tokeep a strong defense and police force.   The Tories have been on the defensive this week, hurt bytwo newspaper polls published yesterday that gave Labor afive-point lead. But the Tories believe that once thecampaigners really hit the hustings, the likability of PrimeMinister John Major, who continues to score much higher thanMr. Kinnock in personal ratings, will help the Tory effort.And indeed, an opinion poll to be published in today's DailyTelegraph gave the Conservative Party a two-point lead overLabor.</TEXT></DOC>
