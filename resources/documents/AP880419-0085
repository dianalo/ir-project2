The 29-year-old defendant looked dejected after hearing thesentence and slumped into his chair. He made no comment.   Presiding Judge Klaus Arend said Abbas Hamadi was guilty of thecharges of kidnapping, coercion and possession of explosives.   Alfred Schmidt, one of two West Germans kidnapped in the weekafter Mohammed Hamadi's arrest, has been freed. Arend appealed forthe release of the second, businessman Rudolf Cordes, who has beenheld since Jan. 17, 1987.   ``Free Rudolf Cordes and show the world your own humanity,'' thejudge said.   He condemned terrorism, saying: ``Terrorists work to bend otherpeople to their will.''   Arend said that after Mohammed Hamadi's arrest at Frankfurtairport in January 1987, Abbas Hamadi talked by telephone withpeople in the Lebanese capital, including another brother, AbdulHadi Hamadi.   ``After the capture of Mohammed Hamadi these men formed a circlein Beirut who decided to do something to block the possibleextradition (to the United States) of Mohammed Hamadi,'' Arend said.   In testimony at the trial, West German police said they hadmonitored telephone calls made by Abbas Hamadi, who has lived inWest Germany for several years.   Abdul Hadi Hamadi is Beirut security chief of Hezbollah, aradical pro-Iranian Shiite Moselm group that is believed to be anumbrella for the groups holding 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon.   The 13-year prison sentence came as a surprise becauseprosecutors had asked only for a sentence of 11{ years.   Throughout the trial that began Jan. 5, Abbas Hamadi deniedhaving anything to do with the kidnappings.   Prosecutors said Hamadi participated in the abductions in anattempt to force the West German government to release MohammedHamadi, who is being held on charges stemming from the 1985hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut. A U.S. Navy diver was killedand 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days in the hijacking.   Defense attorney Ludwig Hoeller told the court last week thatAbbas Hamadi did not contest the explosives charges against him andrecommended that he be sentenced to one year in prison. But Hoellersaid his client should be freed because he had served more than ayear in investigative custody.   Federal agents testified during the trial that Abbas Hamadi'sfingerprints were found on a letter Schmidt wrote to his motherwhile he was being held hostage.   Federal prosecutor Karl-Heinz Schnarr said in his closingarguments that evidence did not link Abbas Hamadi directly to thegunmen who abducted the Germans, but he said the defendant played arole after the kidnappings.   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13,1987 while carrying liquid explosives. Abbas Hamadi was arrested inFrankfurt on Jan. 26, 1987.   Mohammed Hamadi was charged in February with murder, hijacking,hostage-taking and other crimes connected to the TWA hijacking.After his arrest, Abbas Hamadi admitted helping his brother hideliquid explosives near Abbas Hamadi's home in Saarland state.   The coercion charge against Abbas Hamadi stemmed from hisattempt to force the West German government to reject a U.S.extradition request for his brother. West Germany denied therequest last year, but promised that Mohammed Hamadi would be puton trial in West Germany.   Last week, a Frankfurt state court said a juvenile court wouldhear Mohammed Hamadi's case because he may have been under age 21when the hijacking was being planned. The juvenile court couldstill decide to try Mohammed as an adult.</TEXT></DOC>
