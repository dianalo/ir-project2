In 1980 the total remote population was 141,700,the largest segments being British Columbia and the Northwest Territories.This population is expected to decline as some communities become connectedto grids and thus are no longer considered as remote. Total energy usein 1980 by remote communities in Canada is estimated at 8.3 PJ, expectedto fall to 6.6 PJ by 2000. Over 60% of the energy demand is for residentialuse, mostly space heating. About 60% of end-use energy was supplied byheating oil, 25% by diesel, and 15% by wood. Major remote communitieshave ca 350 MW of diesel electric generating capacity installed, requiringca 1.3 million bbl/y of diesel oil supplied at high cost. Examinationof the availability of alternative, renewable energy sources in remoteareas is surveyed for solar, wind, ocean-related, biomass, small hydro,geothermal, and peat sources. A preliminary review suggests that geothermaland ocean-related sources offer little possibility of contributing tothe energy supply; peat has possibilities in certain areas; active solarmay have a limited but strategic role, the main problem being the largeseasonal variations; small hydro and wind sources look promising at anumber of sites; and biomass, especially from the forest, is available,already in use, and has a significant additional potential as a sourcefor electricity generation in a number of areas. 10 figs., 46 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
