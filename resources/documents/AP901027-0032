There will be ``a large vote in favor,'' said the councilpresident, British Ambassador Sir David Hannay.   The new resolution, set for a vote at midday today, was the 10thsince the invasion on Aug. 2.   In previous resolutions, the 15-member council has isolated Iraqwith an economic embargo and permitted U.N. member countries to useflotillas of warships in the Persian Gulf to enforce it. Thecouncil also has demanded that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait andrelease all hostages.   The draft resolution, supported by at least 13 nations, invitesnations, companies and individuals to document their damage andlosses for the council, but does not establish a system for makingclaims against Baghdad.   The proposal also demands that Iraq stop taking hostages and``mistreating and oppressing Kuwaiti and third-state nationals.''   It also moves toward establishing Iraq's responsibility for warcrimes, inviting nations to collect information on serious abusesof civilians contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 andto share it with the council.   The convention, which Iraq signed, protects the rights ofcivilians in wartime or in military-occupied territory, outlawingsummary execution, torture, deportations and hostage-taking.   Although the new resolution holds Iraq liable for war damages,it does not provide for punitive reparations.   Kuwaiti Ambassador Mohammad A. Abulhasan estimated that Iraq hasless than $800 million in assets in the United States, which willpay $22 billion more in energy costs in a year due to the rise inoil prices following the invasion.   The draft resolution also says Iraq must allow the immediateprovision of food, water and basic services to diplomats andforeigners in diplomatic missions in Kuwait City.   Iraq says Kuwait is now a province of Iraq and that thediplomats must move their operations to Baghdad. It has cut offwater and electricity to the embassies. The U.S., British andFrench compounds are the last Western holdouts.   The proposed resolution asks Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar to use his influence to see that the demands are met, andhe is encouraged to be available to assist ``in reaching a peacefulsolution to the crisis.''   The draft threatens Iraq with unspecified new punishment underChapter 7 of the U.N. Charter if it doesn't obey all itsresolutions.   Chapter 7 allows punitive action up to, and including,collective use of military force.   Western diplomats conceded they have few new major actions theycan take to pressure Iraq, aside from severing telephone, fax andcables services and retaliating against Baghdad's embassies.   In coming resolutions the council could establish the mechanismsfor making economic claims against Iraq, and could take concretesteps toward establishing a war crimes tribunal.   Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari said the latest resolutionwas a preparation so that someone can eventually say `` `Well, wehave exhausted all possible resolutions of the Security Council'sauthority, it is now time now to use force.'
