Today in Paris, the International Energy Agency will announce major upward revisions in its closely watched estimates of world oil demand. Although the IEA declined to discuss details prior to the announcement, one source familiar with the figures puts the new estimate of demand for OPEC oil in this year's first quarter at 17.6 million barrels a day. That's sharply higher than other industry estimates -- including OPEC's internal projections -- which generally are around 17 million barrels a day or less for the current quarter.    Equally important, total OPEC output already may have declined to the demand level expected to be forecast by the IEA. Evidence is sketchy, and there have been false signals before. But OPEC production does appear to be falling now from December's level of 18.6 million barrels a day. A preliminary estimate by London-based Petroleum Economics Ltd. pegs OPEC production at a million barrels a day less than in December -- at 17.6 million barrels a day, in fact, during January's first week.    &quot;One week's figures don't tell you what the month will be,&quot; says Keith Hamm, director of Petroleum Economics, &quot;but there are signs some countries have reduced output willingly, while others have had to because of lower demand.&quot;    But neither Mr. Hamm, who is an adviser to some OPEC members, nor a number of other oil consultants and analysts expect these developments to erase the potential for further major deterioration in oil prices before spring. Despite the new IEA assessments and the probable short-term firming of prices, oil-market fundamentals remain bearish. That's largely because of high world oil inventories; the possibility of petroleum demand turning sluggish if there is a recession; and continued skepticism that OPEC can successfully match production to demand, whatever the need for its oil.    Mr. Hamm suggests, for example, that the 13 members of OPEC must cut back production even more if they are to maintain their benchmark price through 1988. &quot;If they want to stick to $18 a barrel, we would put demand (for OPEC oil) for the year as a whole at below 17 million barrels a day,&quot; he says. But he says if OPEC was willing to tolerate prices of $14 to $14.50 a barrel, its members could produce an average of 18 million barrels a day for the year.    At last month's meeting of the oil ministers, 12 of the 13 OPEC members -- with Iraq excluded -- agreed to continue their production quotas totaling 15.1 million barrels a day through this year's first half. But several of the Persian Gulf producers have been producing beyond their quotas. &quot;Even if there is no (further) cheating, and we add Iraq's production of 2.7 million barrels a day, we are already beyond the demand for OPEC oil in the first quarter,&quot; notes Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based oil consultant.    Mr. Karbassioun, a former staff member at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, doubts the sincerity of some of the numerous public claims by exporters that they are suddenly adhering to official price and production quotas. He says, nonetheless, that Saudi Arabia apparently is encouraging the Persian Gulf region's excess producers -- notably Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq -- &quot;to initiate a short swing (down in production) to avoid a call for an extraordinary meeting&quot; of OPEC.    Even the Saudis, he says, appear willing to go along in such short-term cutbacks &quot;to firm up the market,&quot; despite their repeated insistence that they would maintain production at their official quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, regardless of any adverse effect on prices.    Most OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, have some market-related pricing plans in effect or on hold to assure themselves a minimum level of production. As previously reported, the four U.S. oil companies that operate Arabian American Oil Co. have an understanding with Saudi Arabia that they will be kept &quot;economically whole&quot; through rebates or other pricing mechanisms as long as they maintain their full contract volumes. But Japanese companies and other major customers so far are being rebuffed by Saudi Arabia, as well as by several other Mideast exporters in their attempts to obtain price discounts.    Industry officials interpret this refusal as a sign that the Saudis and several other producers will quietly allow production to come down, at least for the moment, rather than accept lower prices. &quot;As long as the Saudis can hang on, the price structure, though weak, will not break,&quot; says Fereidun Fesharaki, an international oil expert at Honolulu's East-West Center. If the price does plunge, however, most oil economists don't expect it to happen before February or March, and few look for a crash like that of two years ago.    In a major new study, Petroleum Finance Co. concludes that the end of the oil industry's long slide is in sight -- likely to be reached between 1990 and 1992 -- and that crude oil prices, in real terms, will double by the peak of the next expansion. Meanwhile, however, the Washington-based firm foresees a &quot;high probability&quot; that crude oil prices will fall to an average of $13 to $15 a barrel in 1986 dollars. &quot;Basically, the $13-to-$15 range has the highest probability this year,&quot; says Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of Petroleum Finance. &quot;It will probably be in the February-March period.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
