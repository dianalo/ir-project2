Detailed seismic stratigraphyalong regional profiles going via boreholes is the only way to determinethe different parameters required for computing subsidence. An investigationof the subsidence of the Viking Graben in the North Sea has revealedthree episodes: (a) The Permo-Triassic(Saalian?) distension phase. (b)The later Jurassic (Kimmerian) distension phase which created the majorstructures in this zone. (c) The Paleocene phase corresponding to thebacklash of the westward opening of the North Atlantic. Subsidence mapsfor different eras reveal the influence of the Caledonian framework.Two principal directions appear, one NE-SW corresponding to structuraldirections visible in Scotland and the other a more discreet NE-SW oneseparating the southern Viking Graben from the northern Viking Graben.</TEXT></DOC>
