At a hastily scheduled hearing just before the close ofbusiness Friday, the failed bank won an order that blocksregulatory actions or any new U.S. lawsuits against BCCIHoldings (Luxembourg) S.A. and its subsidiaries. The order,issued after as little as an hour's notice to some of theparties, expires Friday, when a hearing on whether to extendit will be held.</LP><TEXT>   The creation of a new legal battleground not onlyincreases the complexity of the BCCI tangle, but may also pitthe interests of U.S. creditors against those overseas. Theaction could, for instance, block U.S. regulators fromseizing First American Bankshares Inc., BCCI's principalasset in the U.S., so that BCCI could dispose of the bank onterms favorable to BCCI's 1.2 million depositors, almost allof whom live overseas. There aren't any signs that regulatorswere planning such a move, however.   The order also apparently freezes the Federal Reserve'srecently announced $200 million civil penalty against BCCI,as well as BankAmerica Corp.'s attempt to secure $175 millionin a civil case and a variety of asset seizures by New Yorkand California regulators.   The order also came just as Lloyds of London was on theverge of achieving discovery of key BCCI documents inconnection with a civil suit pending in federal court inMiami. &quot;The bankruptcy statutes weren't designed to protectfraud by preventing the production of records,&quot; a Lloydslawyer fumed yesterday.   In other developments over the weekend in the unfoldingaffair of the rogue bank:   -- Officials said the Central Intelligence Agency suppliedan intelligence report on the financial links between BCCIand First American to the Treasury Department and Comptrollerof Currency as early as the first weeks of 1985, more than ayear prior to a previously reported CIA memo. Officials alsodisclosed the agency maintained deposits at BCCI branchespartly to help cultivate BCCI officials as intelligencesources.   -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said on the CBS-TVprogram &quot;Face the Nation&quot; yesterday that he expects &quot;furtherand more far-reaching indictments very soon,&quot; perhaps &quot;in amonth or six weeks.&quot; At the federal level BCCI was previouslyindicted on money-laundering charges; earlier this month thebank and two of its founders were indicted by a county grandjury in New York on fraud and grand larceny charges.   -- A June 1991 audit by Price Waterhouse for the Bank ofEngland found that BCCI paid a total of $47 million to Arabsheiks who acted as front men in its secret purchase ofWashington's First American, according to reports in theBritish press.   -- The French Banking Association asked the government ofAbu Dhabi, which acquired control of BCCI last year, to bailout depositors at BCCI's French affiliate. The associationdemanded compensation on terms at least equal to those thatAbu Dhabi has proposed for depositors in the U.K.   -- Peru fired its representative at the World Bank, BrianJensen, citing his former association with scandal-plaguedBCCI.   -- BCCI's top official in Pakistan emphatically deniedthat a secret network, which in published reports was linkedto such illicit activities as narcotics, operated out of thebank's Karachi office.   The bankruptcy-court filing on Friday represented asuccessful second step by BCCI's owners to keep regulators atbay following the seizure of the bank in several countries onJuly 5. A court in London previously froze the Bank ofEngland's intended liquidation of BCCI's U.K. operationsuntil December, giving Abu Dhabi the opportunity toreorganize the $20 billion bank on its own terms.   &quot;This is a last ditch effort to refloat the Titanic,&quot; saidJack Blum, a Washington lawyer, who investigated BCCI for aSenate foreign relations subcommittee.   BCCI's request was made under a U.S. bankruptcy law thatallows representatives of a company being liquidated overseasto protect its assets in the U.S. for the benefit of allcreditors. One of the frustrations of the BCCI case is thatthere is no international forum for coordinating theliquidation of a company facing litigation in severalcountries at once. BCCI has operations in about 70 countries.   The complexity of the proceedings was evident in Friday'sbankruptcy filing, which was made not by BCCI itself but byforeign representatives of BCCI who had been appointed bycourts in England, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands toprotect BCCI's assets.   Ronald DeKoven of Shearman andamp; Sterling, a U.S. lawyerrepresenting the BCCI foreign representatives, said thathalting all litigation in the U.S. was &quot;an effort to imposesome order on what is rapidly becoming chaotic.&quot; Judge JamesGarrity said he agreed with BCCI's representatives that U.S.legal actions had to be stopped to &quot;prevent the piecemealdissipation of the assets.&quot; Regulators and others with claimsin the U.S., he said, &quot;will have an adequate opportunity topursue their claims in the foreign proceedings.&quot;   Underlining the case for the restraining order, Mr.DeKoven asserted that the U.S. government was preparingadditional actions againt BCCI. Representatives of a federalagency, which he declined to identify, visited a BCCI officein Manhattan Friday and demanded to examine its books andrecords, he said.   Regulators were dismayed by Friday's order. RichardZiegler, an attorney for the New York state Superintendent ofBanking, accused BCCI representatives of &quot;trying to rideroughshod&quot; over regulators.   An attorney for the Manhattan district attorney's office,which obtained last week's indictment of BCCI, expressedconcern about how the bankruptcy order will affect theirinvestigation, especially in attempting to obtain companyrecords. But attorneys for the BCCI representatives said theorder won't be used to interfere with the continuinggrand-jury investigation.   Shearman andamp; Sterling -- which usually appears in bankruptcycourt representing its best-known client, Citicorp's Citibankunit -- was hired by BCCI's foreign liquidators in mid-July.The firm's Mr. DeKoven acknowledged that the restrainingorder was needed in the event federal regulators decided totake control of First American, Washington's biggest bankholding company -- a move that would cause the unit's valueto plummet.   The scale of the fraud and deception practiced by BCCI hasled to an angry chorus asking why regulators and lawenforcement agencies didn't act sooner against BCCI.   The contents of the 1985 CIA memo on BCCI's secretinvolvement in First American remain secret, but officialssaid the information was regarded as significant enough to berouted by the Treasury-CIA liaison to the offices of theTreasury Secretary and the Comptroller.   Reached over the weekend, former Treasury Secretary DonaldRegan was asked if he had seen the early CIA report. &quot;CallMorocco,&quot; he said, referring to the travels of his successorat the Treasury, James Baker, who is currently traveling inthe Arab world attempting to foster an Arab-Israeli peacesettlement. &quot;I left {the Treasury} in December of 1984,&quot; heexplained, adding that to the best of his recollectionneither the CIA nor anyone else ever brought the BCCI-FirstAmerican issue to his attention. Mr. Baker hasn't beenavailable for comment.   For its part, the CIA held multiple accounts with BCCIaround the world, but in recent days, the agency hasportrayed its involvement as part of an effort to gain awindow through which to watch narcotics and terroristactivities. The unusual public defense appears driven partlyby the politics of the pending nomination of Robert Gates,who served in the CIA during most of the 1980s, to be the CIAdirector.   The agency's accounts with BCCI, all of which it says itclosed down by the end of 1989, went beyond any single covertoperation. Though not large in terms of BCCI's deposits orthe CIA's budget, the funds placed by the agency totaled inthe millions.   In some cases, the agency was drawn in because a person orcompany it was working with used BCCI. By making deposits,the CIA could gain access to bank officials and learn aboutoperations. &quot;You get in to talk to the bank manager, youlearn more as a big depositor,&quot; said one official.   But in an interview, BCCI's top official in Pakistanquestioned reports that the CIA used BCCI to funnel cash tothe Afghan guerrillas.   A. Basir, Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce (Overseas) Ltd.'sgeneral manager in Karachi, said it's conceivable that theCIA operated covertly through BCCI under the guise of any ofa number of multinational corporations.   &quot;It wasn't possible for it to have taken place entirelyoutside the books,&quot; he said.   The only companies that routinely remitted large sums ofmoney abroad or into Pakistan, he said, were large oil,pharmaceutical and chemical companies that do business inPakistan, almost a dozen of which he named.   Mr. Basir rejected a report in Time magazine alleging thatBCCI operated a secret, 1,500-person &quot;black network&quot; out ofits Karachi head office that arranged everything from drugsmuggling to assassinations. Only 800 people work at BCCI inPakistan, he says, and that he knows all of those who work inKarachi. &quot;If I say that this is the product of a very viciousand scheming mind I am not understating it,&quot; he said.   Other bankers in Karachi privately agree, although somesay they believe BCCI may have been the bank of choice fororganized criminals in Karachi -- where robberies and murdersare common and kidnapping is a business -- just as it was forup-and-coming businessmen with international ties. &quot;It was aservice bank, efficient and confidential,&quot; one banker said.   ---   Marcus Brauchli in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed tothis article.</TEXT></DOC>
