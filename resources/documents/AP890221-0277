(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole todayasked labor leaders for their help and guidance but said it was tooearly to respond to the AFL-CIO's request for intervention in anEastern Airlines labor dispute.   ``I want a continued dialogue with the individuals in that roomand certainly I want to have my door open and to be in touch withthem regularly,'' Mrs. Dole said after meeting with the AFL-CIOExecutive Council.   In her statement to the council, Mrs. Dole said that ``to succeedin this mission, let me say once again that I will need your help,your guidance. We may not always agree on the best way to resolvethe issues before us. But I assure you today that my door willalways be open.''   Some of those disagreements were immediately apparent, however.   Mrs. Dole said the administration remains committed to asub-minimum youth training wage as part of any attempt to increasethe minimum wage. Labor leaders want the minimum wage raised butvehemently oppose the training wage. And Mrs. Dole said PresidentBush opposes mandatory child care and parental leave policies, bothitems on labor's congressional agenda.   The Executive Council on Monday opened its annual meeting byasking Bush to appoint a presidential emergency board to mediate thedispute between Eastern machinists and management. Such a move woulddelay a strike planned for March 4 by 60 days.   But Mrs. Dole said it was premature to say whether Bush wouldappoint a board, saying he was awaiting a report from the NationalMediation Board and legal advice from the Labor and Transportationdepartments.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland promised full support for theEastern machinists in the event of a strike.   ``The AFL-CIO will mobilize its resources to assist the employeesat Eastern to the fullest possible support in the event themachinists are forced to strike,'' Kirkland said.   The call for Bush to intervene in the 16-month dispute before aMarch 4 strike deadline dominated the first day of the council'sannual meeting.   The federation's 35-member governing body also issued severalstatements on its domestic policy agenda, including calls for anincreased minimum wage and legislation expanding the availability ofchild care and parental leave.   The Eastern dispute could provide the first sign of therelationship the Bush administration will have with labor.   Kirkland said Monday that the ``atmosphere'' of labor's relationswith the White House have improved since Bush took office, but addedthat that could change if Bush rejects the machinists' request for apresidential emergency board to mediate the dispute.   Asked what his reaction would be if Bush refused to name anemergency board, Kirkland, said, ``I think he would be sending asignal that he sides with one of the most irresponsible andavaricious employers in the country.''   If Bush did name such a panel, it would automatically delay by 60days the strike deadline. If no agreement was reached in thatperiod, the board would recommend a settlement. Congress has thepower to force both Eastern and the union to abide by it.   Kirkland called on other unions to honor picket lines if themachinists strike, but acknowledged that previous walkouts againstairlines have failed because union workers, particularly pilots,have ignored pickets.   However, Kirkland and other union leaders spoke optimistically ofthe prospect of a unified union effort in the event of a strike,saying unions that might otherwise have been reluctant to supportthe machinists likely would do so because of the anti-union recordof Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's parent company, TexasAir Corp.   Charles E. Bryan, president of the Miami district lodge of themachinists' union, said his plans for a strike included picketingand boycotting Eastern's sister carrier, Continental Airlines, andany other carriers that have service agreements with Eastern,Continental or Texas Air.   Those pickets also would include any carriers of cargo andbaggage either destined for or already carried by Eastern andContinental, including railroads, Bryan said.   He said there was no chance of a settlement before the March 4deadline. Eastern has demanded that the machinists accept wage cutsof 20 percent to nearly 50 percent as well was reductions incompany-paid pension benefits.   Eastern officials have said the airline would hire replacementsand operate during any strike. Support from pilots would be vital tolabor's goal of preventing that.   Ironically, many of the union leaders here for the meetingtraveled on Eastern, which offered the AFL-CIO a group discount.</TEXT></DOC>
