Buyers of single-family homes who lined up fixed-rate mortgages in early March received an average effective interest rate of 10.34%, down from 10.48% in early February and the lowest average rate since April 1987, the Bank Board reported. The figures apply to mortgages maturing in 15 years or more, and include points paid by the buyer.    Meanwhile, initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages slid to 8.65% in early March, the lowest level since last August. The rate in early February was 8.72%.    Fixed rates have slid further since the Bank Board collected its figures, and currently are hovering around 10%.    &quot;I think they're going to stay fairly flat for the next several months, and then we'll see some increase by the end of the year, possibly as high as 11%,&quot; said John Teutsch, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Rates are &quot;in affordable ranges&quot; and should bolster the housing industry, he added.    Earlier this week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported that the average rate for 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages rose to 10.05% for the week ended April 1 from 9.99% a week earlier. (Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.)    Robert Van Order, chief economist at Freddie Mac, predicted renewed pressure for higher interest rates. &quot;The economy appears to have more spunk than previously thought,&quot; he said.    Mark Obrinsky, economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said, &quot;I think we've seen the lowest rates for the next six months and possibly for the rest of the year.&quot; General economic weakness, coupled with liquidity pumped into the financial system by the Federal Reserve since last October's stock-market crash, have helped depress rates.    The reverse seems to be occurring now. &quot;Economic numbers are stronger, and it's clear the Fed has stopped easing,&quot; Mr. Obrinsky said. The combination should kick rates up a bit, he said.    For the second month, fixed rates fell faster than adjustable rates, the Bank Board reported. The result was a narrowing of the spread between the two rates to 1.69 percentage points, and an increase in the share of home buyers choosing fixed-rate mortgages to 43% from 31% last December.    Mr. Teutsch of the Mortgage Bankers Association said the ratio could eventually be 50-50. &quot;It's almost a toss-up which a customer would want to have,&quot; he said.    The Bank Board also reported that the purchase price of a new home in early March rose to $144,600 from a revised $139,400 in early February. The figures vary widely from month to month. </TEXT></DOC>
