Ties between China and Soviet-allied Mongolia have been strainedthe past three decades, and President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat is thefirst Mongolian head of government to visit China since 1962.   Ochirbat, here at the invitation of Chinese President YangShangkun, is seeking greater economic exchanges and access to aChinese port for landlocked Mongolia.   Mongolia's ruling Communist Party has given up its monopoly onpower and has promised free elections this summer. A number ofopposition parties have sprung up since the reform movement,inspired by similar campaigns in the Soviet Union and East Europe,began last December.   However, the reforms have sparked unrest, including a wave ofprotests reported in Mongolia as Orchirbat began his visit.   China reportedly has stepped up surveillance of its 3.5 millionMongol minority out of concern the democratic impulses of Mongoliacould spill across the border. Chinese Premier Li Peng indicatedFriday that Beijing expects Mongolia to do what it can to keep thatfrom happening.   Li said the two countries should have ``non-interference in eachother's internal and party affairs.''   In Mongolia, sit-ins demanding replacement of theCommunist-dominated legislature were being staged in a half-dozenMongolian cities and a hunger strike continued in the northern cityof Moron, a foreign source in the capital of Ulan Bator said.   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said five of the17 hunger strikers, some of whom stopped eating last Saturday, hadbeen hospitalized.   The source also said talks between the government and oppositiongroups seeking a faster pace of democratic reform had stalled.Opposition activists on Thursday said no new talks were scheduledwith the government.   The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, reported thatMongolian Prime Minister Sharavyn Gunjaadorg had accused oppositiongroups of causing ``political panic'' with their ``unbridledactivities.'' It said the comments came in a televised speechThursday night.   The government has accused the opposition of refusing an offerto hold a national referendum on disbanding the legislature andreplacing it with a provisional multiparty body that would governuntil elections, the source said.   About 25 to 30 people were taking part in the sit-in in the mainsquare of Ulan Bator. The demonstration, which began May 2,attracted 300 to 400 people Thursday night. There were few policein view.   Opposition leaders were criticizing Ochirbat for traveling toChina when the country was facing a political crisis, the sourcesaid.   At a banquet Friday night hosted by Yang, Ochirbat called hisvisit an important step in furthering political, economic, culturaland scientific cooperation.   Other details of the talks were not available, but it was likelythey discussed the easing of tensions along the Sino-Mongolianborder as well as trade and other bilateral issues.   China has long objected to the heavy concentration of Soviettroops in Mongolia, many stationed along the desert and grasslandfrontier that divides Mongolia and China. However, the Soviet Unionlast year began withdrawing its troops, and says the last of 60,000Soviet soldiers will leave Mongolia by 1992.   Mongolia, which has a population of only 2 million in a nationnearly as big as all of West Europe, became the world's secondcommunist state in 1921.   China, which in the past laid claims to all of Mongolia, did notrecognize the Soviet-allied state until the Chinese Communists cameto power in 1949.   Relations were good during the 1950s, but from 1960 onwardMongolia joined the Soviet Union in splitting with China overideological differences. Ties began to slowly improve asSino-Soviet tensions eased from the mid-1980s.</TEXT></DOC>
