There's no room in socialism for fun or fantasy.    Prof. Dascomb Forbosh, the celebrated conspiratologist, has recently disclosed to me the results of his lifelong study of the secret, encrypted journals of Walt Disney. The army of animators Mr. Cockburn thinks were so cruelly exploited were in reality all members of a secret brotherhood, led by Disney, dedicated to expounding the nature of Marxist-Leninism (or vice versa) and prophesying its future. Snow White is the allegory they created.    Snow White represents Marxism itself, alluring and ineffable but still a cartoon. Naturally she is the vanguard leading the proletarian dwarfs to a better life. Grumpy was rehabilitated with a bath, just as current grumpers are re-educated in asylums or the Gulag. The stepmother personifies the Nomenklatura and the apple is obviously Gosplan that has put the whole works in a state of catalepsy.    Prof. Forbosh has been able to decipher only fragments of the prophetic portions of the Disney journals. He believes the Prince represents Gorbachev and the kiss that awakens Snow White is &quot;glasnost,&quot; but has no idea where it is they are riding off to.    Stuart T. Martin   Burlington, Vt.   ---   We should be indebted to Mr. Cockburn for giving us a peek into the mind of a confirmed socialist. In a short article he deprecates the creation of wealth, compares humans unfavorably to animals, and makes Snow White into a coercive dictator. Coming from someone who has for years exalted such violators of human rights as Ortega, Castro and Mao Tse-tung, this is indeed revealing. Since he is unable to distinguish the benefits of democracy from cacocracy, he is doubtless unaware that socialists are basically misanthropes.    Harry Lee Smith   Alpharetta, Ga.</TEXT></DOC>
