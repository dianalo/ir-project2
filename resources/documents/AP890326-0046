Students clashed withtroops in two southern cities.   Riot squads were posted outside important government buildingsin Seoul and at some major intersections.   Police declined to say how many troops were deployed, but about700 riot police in 18 buses were posted at the U.S. Embassy Sunday.   Roh last week ordered security forces to take tough measures tohalt a wave of protests and break up radical organizations he saidwere trying to stage a violent revolution. Radicals have called forthe resignation of Roh, who they say is not committed to genuinedemocracy.   No incidents were reported in Seoul, but radical studentsclashed with riot police in the southern provincial cities ofChonju and Kwangju, according to Yonhap, the national news agency.   In Chonju, police battled about 600 protesters who hurledfirebombs and rocks after they were blocked from marching out ofChonbuk University, Yonhap said. In Kwangju, several hundredstudents battled police after police stopped them from leavingChonam University to support strikers at a shipyard, the reportsaid.   About 1,000 dissidents and radical students took part in apeaceful rally at Korea University in western Seoul to demand Roh'simmediate resignation. Dissident leaders denounced Roh and accusedhim of attempting to impose military rule.   ``We call for the resignation of the Roh Tae-woo regime whichcannot carry out democratic reforms and does not represent thenation,'' said a declaration by the United National DemocraticMovement, South Korea's main dissident alliance.   About 2,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and visoredhelmets were posted in sidestreets around the campus. Theprotesters dispersed peacefully.   Yonhap also reported that police arrested about 600 studentslate Saturday after a violent protest earlier in the day at YonseiUniversity in east Seoul. National Police Headquarters said itcould not confirm the report.   Roh announced March 20 he was indefinitely postponing a promisedreferendum on his performance because of disputes over how to holdthe vote and violent protests by radicals.   The former general called the radicals a threat to politicalstability and said they were attempting to stage a leftistrevolution.   Radicals have mounted a series of violent anti-governmentprotests, mainly on college campuses, to call for Roh's removal.But they lack public support because most South Koreans rejecttheir violent tactics, and are not seen as a serious threat to thegovernment's hold on power.   It was not clear if Roh could win a referendum even though hisgovernment has helped introduce broad democratic reforms. ManySouth Koreans are critical of Roh for his ties to his former allyand authoritarian predecessor, former president Chun Doo-hwan.</TEXT></DOC>
