Conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that institutionalinvestors, especially mutual funds, have spent almost all themoney they can on stocks. That's one reason -- along withnear-record prices and other high readings of stock valuation-- that the market's Christmas rally flattened out in the newyear.</LP><TEXT>   But changing conditions throw rules of thumb out of joint,others argue. In their view, standard measures of potentialstock-purchasing power aren't any more reliable than a bustedfuel gauge on your car's dashboard.   In this corner, for the traditionalists, is Byron Wien,the chief U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. &quot;Cashlevels are a terrific indicator at market extremes, andthat's where we are now,&quot; he says.   His favorite cash indicator is the level of cash at mutualfunds. It indicates sentiment among professional fundmanagers as well as attitudes of individual investors, who hesays are turning increasingly away from stock-picking tomutual funds in their approach to the market.   At last check by the Investment Company Institute, a tradegroup, stock-investing mutual funds had $29.7 billion in cashon Jan. 31, or 7.9% of their total assets of $375 billion.That's the lowest since December 1983 when cash amounted to7.8% of total mutual fund assets.   &quot;When mutual fund cash is this low, it's a sign you shouldbe getting defensive,&quot; Mr. Wien warns.   In the other corner is Laszlo Birinyi, principal ofBirinyi andamp; Associates, a market research firm. He concedesthat mutual fund cash levels may seem low, but they reallyaren't because the role of mutual funds in the market haschanged markedly in the past decade.   At the beginning of the 1980s, the total capitalization ofthe New York Stock Exchange was $960 billion; mutual fundshad a total of $32.5 billion in assets, or about 3.4% of thetotal market, he says. At the end of 1991, the Big Board'stotal capitalization had nearly quadrupled to $3.71 trillion,but mutual funds had grown more than tenfold, to $370billion, or 10% of the Big Board market.   &quot;The point is, mutual funds have become a much more potentforce in the market,&quot; he says. &quot;A decade ago, mutual fundcash was just a sentiment indicator. Today, it's an actualsupply-and-demand indicator, a fundamental power in themarket.&quot;   The difference, he says, lies in how a mutual fund managerhandles the assets under his control. &quot;In 1980, the managerwho was 10% in cash was basically indicating a negativeattitude toward the market, but he could turn aroundrelatively quickly if events warranted it,&quot; says Mr. Birinyi.   &quot;Today, if managers get to 10% cash levels they would haveto be concerned because it takes them so long to getinvested. If the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in a bigway in the morning, there's no way you could be fullyinvested by 4 p.m. or even the next day.&quot;   Mr. Birinyi's conclusion: Cash as a percentage of mutualfund portfolios may be dropping, but with assets climbing sofast, the uninvested cash still amounts to a big storage tankof market fuel.   The two analysts' views about how much money individualinvestors have left to shell into stocks -- either directlyor via mutual funds -- are equally contradictory. &quot;Individualfinancial assets, not including houses, is around $15trillion,&quot; says Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley, &quot;and of thatabout $2.9 trillion is in direct ownership of common stocksand equity mutual funds. So everybody says `Well, gee, ifindividuals increase their stock ownership by just 1%, thatwould be $150 billion, a very big number that would reallydrive the market up.' But you can't look at it that way.&quot;   Mr. Wien excludes $3.7 trillion that is in pension fundand life insurance reserves, because individuals have nodiscretion over it, and another $2.5 trillion that is tied upin unincorporated businesses, like neighborhood dry cleaners.That leaves $5.4 trillion, or about 37% of the total, indeposits and credit market instruments. This is the moneythat individuals potentially could move into the market, Mr.Wien agrees. But he notes that the proportion of 37% hasremained steady for five years.   &quot;How many individuals would really bring their checkingaccount balance to zero to play the market?&quot; he asks. &quot;What Iconclude from this is that all the excitement about potentialbuying power among individuals is exaggerated.&quot;   Mr. Birinyi, by contrast, is confident individuals haveplenty socked away in money market funds and bankcertificates of deposit to be invested in stocks, especiallyif short-term interest rates stay at their current low levelsor even decline further.   He notes that money market funds and bank CDs ballooned by$229 billion in 1988 and 1989, as relatively high interestrates attracted individual investors. In the past year, asshort-term rates have declined, nearly $100 billion has comeout of those funds and CDs, leaving roughly $130 billion yetto be reinvested.   &quot;I don't know where it's going to go, but at least itgives us an idea of the potential reservoir out there,&quot; hesays. &quot;There is a possibility that in the 1990s, if interestrates and inflation stay low, a large portion of that couldcome to the stock market.&quot;   Shorter-term -- starting tomorrow, to be exact -- Mr.Birinyi points out that a new slug of cash will becomeavailable to shareholders as more than $10 billion infirst-quarter dividends will be distributed. Thefourth-quarter payouts, he notes, began flowing intoinvestors' pockets just before the Christmas rally got underway -- hastening to disavow any implication of cause andeffect.   Neither analyst thinks the amount of cash in pension fundsis very useful as an indicator. &quot;A lot of institutions don'thave the discretion that would make pension fund cash levelsuseful,&quot; Mr. Wien says. &quot;They're told to be invested and theburden of responsibility has shifted to the plan sponsor.&quot;   Similarly skeptical, Mr. Birinyi notes that Indata, aresearch firm that tracks cash levels, reported thepercentage of pension fund assets in cash on Dec. 20 was4.8%, near an historical low. That was the day the FederalReserve slashed a key short-term interest rate by a fullpercentage point in a bid to stimulate the economy. The movetouched off the Christmas rally, which lifted the Dow JonesIndustrial Average 13% to last Tuesday's record close of3290.25.   &quot;Given the fundamental and monetary circumstances we'rein,&quot; Mr. Birinyi says, &quot;it certainly won't be a lack of cashthat keeps the market from going any higher.&quot;   Curiously, this assessment is endorsed even by someanalysts who dismiss cash levels as &quot;an excuse for explainingwhy the market runs up or down,&quot; in the words of ArthurMicheletti, an investment strategist at the money managementfirm of Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser.   &quot;There always seems to be cash around to push shares upwhen the market is rising,&quot; Mr. Micheletti notes. &quot;If youthink stocks are the place to be you can sell your bonds,your real estate, your gold, or even your grandmother'sportrait in the basement.&quot;   Stock prices fell for a third consecutive session, inspite of the release of an encouraging employment report.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 19.90 points to3221.60, bringing the threeday decline to 68.65 points. Theaverage lost 46.07 points for the week, a 1.41% decline.
