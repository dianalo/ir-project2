The drug, called CD4, mimics a protein normally found on thesurface of certain immune system cells that are susceptible to theAIDS virus.   Researchers hope the experimental drug will, in effect, fool thedeadly virus into harmlessly attaching itself to the injectedsubstance rather than latching onto similar receptors on immunesystem cells.   Approval for the tests beginning on AIDS patients at theNational Cancer Institute was obtained several months ago. Similarstudies are to begin in a few days at San Francisco GeneralHospital and New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.   About 50 patients will be involved in the first round of tests,designed to determine the safety of the drug rather than itseffectiveness. However, scientists also will be looking forevidence the drug, manufactured by Genetech Inc., of San Francisco,counters the growth of the virus by enticing it to attach to thecells of the drug rather than to immune system cells.</TEXT></DOC>
