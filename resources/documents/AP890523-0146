Rep. Frank Wolf's bill is designed to apply retroactively to thecase of Elizabeth Morgan, a plastic surgeon who was jailed when sherefused to produce her daughter Hilary to go on unsupervised visitswith her ex-husband, oral surgeon Eric Foretich. Authorities havebeen unable to find the girl.   D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon held Morgan in civilcontempt of court, and has said she will remain in jail until sherelents.   Morgan, who had been granted custody of the six-year-old girl,alleged that Foretich, the girl's father, had sexually abused thechild on previous unsupervised weekend visits. Foretich has deniedthat.   Wolf's bill, affecting only the District of Columbia, where thefederal government retains substantial control, would change civilcontempt charges to criminal contempt after 18 months. That wouldguarantee Morgan or others the filing of formal charges and acriminal jury trial.   ``What you actually have is civil contempt that is treated moreharshly than criminal contempt,'' Wolf said. ``I think a jury trialis a right, and it would make a tremendous difference.''   Wolf, a Republican who represents a district just across thePotomac River from Washington, criticized the current standoff andsaid, ``I believe that a child who is denied the care of eitherparent is not being well served.''   However, Foretich, who attended the hearing but did not testify,blasted the bill.   ``Not one witness has expressed one scintilla of concern forHilary,'' he said. ``There are absolutely no guarantees that mydaughter will be returned if her mother is freed.''   Foretich, who has suggested that an independent panel of expertsevaluate Hilary, her mother and himself, said he would abide by anycustody decision that a group of judges, social workers andpsychiatrists might propose.   ``If they conclude that it is in the best interests of mydaughter for one of us to bow out, I would,'' Foretich said. ``Iwant what is best for her.''   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the JudiciaryCommittee's District of Columbia Subcommittee, said he may scheduleadditional hearings on the bill before scheduling a vote on it.   The city council has no authority over the city's court system.However, council member James Nathanson told the House panel thathe opposed setting a time limit for contempt jailings.   ``If you put a cap on the court's authority, some people willdecide they're willing to pay that price,'' Nathanson said. ``Ithink that a court would be rendered less effective.''   Instead, Nathanson suggested establishing a three-judge panel toreview all civil contempt cases extending past 12 months. UnderNathanson's plan, the group, which would include the judge whoinitially jailed the person, would have to vote unanimously infavor of further incarceration in order to keep the person inprison.</TEXT></DOC>
