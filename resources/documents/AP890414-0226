Fifteen years after the ``Revolution of the Carnations,'' thePortuguese armed forces are back under right-wing leadership,facing flagging popularity and an urgent need for reform.   The decision by Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, a SocialDemocrat, to name the conservative Gen. Antonio Soares Carneiro asarmed forces chief over the army's own, more moderate candidate hasstirred discontent even within the military.   The controversy comes at a time when cooperation betweengenerals and politicians is seen as important for the success of afour-year plan to trim military manpower and modernize equipment.   ``Soares Carneiro was not chosen by the army _ it was obviouslysome sort of political compensation,'' said Maria Carrilho, aleading sociologist and author of ``The Armed Forces and PoliticalChange in 20th Century Portugal.''   ``It shows party politics and the military are still too closelyinterconnected in Portugal, something that shouldn't be the case ina consolidated democracy.''   In 1980, Soares Carneiro ran for president as the candidate ofthe Conservative alliance that joined the Social Democrats with theright-wing Social Democratic Center.   His campaign collapsed after reports were published that he hadauthorized the internment of opponents of the Portuguesedictatorship in a ``recuperation camp'' in Angola toward the end ofPortugal's African colonial wars in the early 1970s.   Former officers who took part in the 1974 revolution say atraditionalist resurgence in the military is likely to furthertaint the forces' already flagging prestige among Portuguese youth.   ``In the period following the revolution, soldiers were the onlyones the people would trust,'' said Lt. Col. Vasco Lourenco, arevolutionary captain in 1974. ``Today, the armed forces are almostashamed to have had anything to do with April 25 and have withdrawninto a shell.''   Ms. Carrilho said that since the abolition in 1982 of thegoverning Revolutionary Council, which was dominated by themilitary, politicians have moved anybody linked to April 25 out ofinfluential positions.   Lourenco, who now heads the private April 25 Association heco-founded after military and government formally split in 1982,complains that military men today haven't been able to makecivilians understand the role of the military in democraticPortugal.   ``Nowadays, the armed forces sense a certain rejection inPortuguese society,'' said Lt. Col. Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, themastermind of the 1974 coup who was sentenced last year to 15 yearsin prison on charges of being the leader of a left-wing urbanterrorist group.   ``Although the masses still have a soft spot for the soldier ofApril 25,'' he said in a prison interview, ``people are now asking_ why do these guys exist? Portugal's not at war, so what are theydoing? They don't produce anything.''   A recent survey by Lisbon University indicated that 66 percentof recruits performing obligatory military service think the draftshould be done away with and that service in the armed forcesshould be voluntary.   ``With relations improving between the United States and theSoviet Union, it's natural that young people all over the world areasking themselves what the armed forces are for,'' said Gen. AmadeoGarcia dos Santos, who sees reform long overdue.   ``The army today is more or less what it was before therevolution, in terms of structure, mentality and equipment.''   Military analysts say Portugal's 90,000-member armed forces arestill large for a small country of just over 10 million people,even though it is a member of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   The need for large land forces to fight the colonial wars inAfrica has left an imbalance among the three service branches.   The army has about 45,000 active soldiers, making it three timeslarger than the air force and the navy.   But this could change as Portugal strives for a more active rolein NATO.   According to Alvaro Vasconcelos at Lisbon's Institute forInternational and Strategic Studies, Portugal's aim is to play amore important role in anti-submarine warfare, which would requiregreater naval and air strength.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs April 21</NOTE></DOC>
