These rules must not make government service a bar to productivework in the private sector, but they must prohibit the appearanceof profiting from government service; and this must include thelegislative branch as well.   I am proposing a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges, whilerestricting their acceptance of honoraria.   I also believe that honoraria for members of Congress should bebanned.   And I believe Congress should have a pay increase.   And I will not make a formal proposal on Congress until after Iconsult with the leaders of Congress on the issue of congressionalpay.   There is no point, absolutely no point, in putting Congressthrough another traumatic bashing like the one just completed.   And I will include, in those consultations, the question of apay increase for certain executive branch positions, includingspecialized jobs like those out there at the National Institutes ofHealth.   And I will strongly support pay increases for these jobs whichare so important to this country.   My ethics program's second goal recognizes that ethicalconsistency demands equitable standards across all three branchesof government.   And under our Constitution, every branch of government is equal,and none warrants preferential treatment.   The same standard that applies to a staff person at HUD(Department of Housing and Urban Development) should also apply tohousing subcommittee staff on Capitol Hill.   And a practice is either ethical or it is not.   And if Washington is to be a level playing field, then everyplayer should be treated the same.   And therefore I am proposing that we must extend the independentcounsel statute to cover the Congress.   I am also proposing that the federal statute that prohibitsemployees from taking actions that enhance their own financialinterest be extended to cover legislative and judicial branchemployees.   There should also be an independent ethics office for Congress,to be headed by a clearly non-partisan official confirmed by bothhouses.   And I ask that the existing one-year post-employment ``coolingoff'' period for the senior executive branch employees also applyto the legislative and the judicial branch.   And then, there's the third objective of this ethics program.   It insists that standards be reasonable and reflect goodold-fashioned common sense.   Some financial interests, for example, are too minor to createany meaningful conflict of interest at all.   So, I want the Office of Government Ethics to have the authorityto issue regulations authorizing waivers from these conflict ofinterest statutes.   But at the same time, we're urging tougher penalties whenintentional violations of criminal conflict of interest laws occur.   We're asking officials from all three branches to simplify theforms that must be completed by prospective appointees, and I'malso requiring mandatory annual briefings on ethics forpresidential appointees.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
