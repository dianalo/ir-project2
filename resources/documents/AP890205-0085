(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Rifle Association invitedStockton officials to a shooting match Sunday in a last-ditch effortto stop a local ban on semiautomatic assault rifles.   Organizers of the target shooting competition hoped to show thatassault rifles, such as the AK-47 rifle used in the Jan. 17 Stocktonschool massacre, have legitimate sporting uses, said J.P. Nelson, anNRA field representative.   The twice-monthly contest was scheduled before gunman PatrickPurdy used the AK-47 rifle to kill five children and injure 30others at Cleveland Elementary School, before killing himself with ahandgun, Nelson said.   Sixty-nine people competed in the match at the San Joaquin Rifleandamp; Pistol Range, located 12 miles east of Stockton. Guns used at thecontest included AR-15, M-1 and AK-47 rifles.   Only one Stockton school official accepted the invitation andshowed up to watch the target shooting, Nelson said.   ``He didn't sound like one of our better friends,'' Nelson said.   The Stockton City Council is expected to ban sales ofsemiautomatic weapons within city limits on Monday.   Several state legislators also have proposed statewiderestrictions following the Stockton school shooting and an increasein drive-by shootings by gangs armed with semiautomatic firearms.   Such restrictions would only affect law-abiding gun owners, notcriminals, Nelson said.   ``You're not going to be able to legislate crazy people sane,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
