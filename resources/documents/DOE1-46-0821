The approach is nonmathematical,descriptive, and pictorial. To illustrate the ideas introduced in thetext, the authors provide original spectra obtained specially for thispurpose. Examples include spectroscopy of protons, carbon, and less receptivenuclei of interest to inorganic chemists. The authors succeed in makinghigh-resolution NMR spectroscopy comprehensible for the average studentor chemist.</TEXT></DOC>
