Sentiment aside, they say, poison gas works and it is nearlyimpossible to control its components without energetic, voluntaryaction by governments and private industry.   At the same time, they add, many small nations refuse to ban suchweapons while neighbors have atomic bombs, the way a streetwiseyouth carries a switch-blade because of bullies down the block.   Few technicians among the 151 delegations attending the five-dayParis conference wanted to be named, leaving the limelight tostatesmen drafting a declaration against producing and usingchemical or biological weapons.   A European specialist summed up the mood: ``This conference isone thing. Controlling the stuff is another. You have to concludethat chemical weapons won the war for Iraq. That sends a very strongnegative message.''   Iraq acknowledged using poison gas in its eight-year war withIraq, in which a cease-fire was reached Aug. 20.   An American expert said many Third World military strategists areseeking advice from Iraq, which he said had five years of experiencewith mustard gas and nerve gas.   Another U.S. specialist said gas and biological agents wouldremain effective against ``inconvenient minorities'' even if nationscould be kept from using them outside their borders.   Iraq has been accused of using poison gas against rebelliousKurds.   Terrorists could wreak havoc with small amounts of nerve agents,without complex delivery systems.   Max Friedersdorf, U.S. envoy to the Geneva disarmament talks,agreed in an interview that a gulf exists between what probably willbe negotiated and what can be applied.   ``There is a technical gap, and 100 percent verification ... isalmost impossible, but that doesn't mean we should not continue,''he said.   Richard Perle, the former senior Defense Department officialinvolved in negotiations, went further in a telephone interview fromWashington.   ``In this case, 100 percent non-verification is the fact,'' hesaid. ``You cannot control this.''   Perle and most experts agreed the only effective measure is tostop companies from exporting essential chemicals or helping othercountries make weapons.   Although some poison gases are easy to make, they say, massproduction and accurate delivery systems require sophisticatedassistance.   ``You cannot let yourself be put off by the handthrower-uppers,'' one American delegate said. ``Of course it ishard, but the horse is not all the way out of the barn. We have todo this fast.''   U.S. and West German specialists estimated 20 to 25 companiesregularly sell chemicals to Third World countries making deadlyagents, and about another 300 have made sales in recent years. Theysaid most of the companies were West German.   The only control now is the informal Australia Suppliers Group,representatives of 19 nations who meet regularly in Paris to discusspossible dangerous sales by private suppliers.   ``We have to rely on each country to provide information and takeaction,'' said a delegate who regularly attends those meetings.``Our effect is limited.''   Even with the best of political will it would take two to threeyears to agree on a treaty and 10 more to eliminate chemicalweapons, he said, and ``that is a long time to keep up politicalpressure.''   West German authorities say they want to prevent dangerousexports but are hampered by lack of an international code.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, addressing theconference, appealed for a ban on chemical weapons combined withmandatory inspections on 48 hours notice in cases of suspicion.   U.S. negotiators first suggested such challenge inspections in1984, Perle said, but subsequent study showed that, ``in a matter ofdays, even hours, all evidence can be removed.''   He added, referring to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi: ``Evenif an accord were reached for investigators to leave the moment theyhad a suspicion, who in their right mind would believe that someonelike Colonel Gadhafi would allow it to happen?''   The United States accuses Libya of building a chemical weaponsplant with the help of a West Germany company. Libya says it is apharmaceutical factory.   Perle said the West Germans should police their own exporters.   ``They allow their companies to get involved in this, cover it upand go around lecturing us,'' he said. Another American delegatecommented: ``It is not an accident that people as efficient as theGermans cannot control these people.''</TEXT></DOC>
