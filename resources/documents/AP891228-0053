Consumers in the East and Midwest will soon be feeling theeffects of the South's Christmas chill as the devastation onFlorida's vegetable farms drives up prices in the grocery stores,agriculture experts said.   Meanwhile, the early winter cold wave continued to make itselffelt farther north today, with barge traffic on Pittsburgh's threerivers slowed to a near standstill by ice.   The long, cold weekend gave way to mostly clear skies andtemperatures in the 40s, 50s, even 60s in much of the Deep South onWednesday, and most of the region will get highs in the 60s today,forecasters said.   Highs in the teens and 20s were forecast from the Northeast tothe Rockies today, with milder temperatures elsewhere.   More than 100 deaths nationwide have been blamed on the coldsince Dec. 15.   In communities from Houston to James Island, S.C., plumbersworked overtime Wednesday to repair water pipes that split in thefreeze, and homeowners faced another day of dry faucets or lowwater pressure.   Governments hoping to restore water pressure begged people toconserve and to shut taps they left trickling to prevent freezing.   In central Louisiana, residents of Boyce were without water fortwo hours Wednesday afternoon and again for five hours overnight asthe town's wells were shut off to allow water levels to rise. InPollock, residents will have only limited water service at leastuntil the weekend, because the town's three wells failed onChristmas Day.   In New Orleans, firefighters pumped water from a bayou to fightan eight-alarm fire at an abandoned cannery after leaks in pipesreduced water pressure throughout the city. And the same problemloomed elsewhere.   ``If we have a fire, we're in trouble,'' said Mayor George Sidesof Dora, Ala., where volunteers helped look for broken pipes. ``Youcan only put so many bricks on the wagon before it breaks.''   Shortages were reported in five Alabama counties, and in Mobile,pressure wasn't expected to return to normal for 93,000 customersfor two more days.   Wilmington, N.C., declared two days of emergency conservation,cutting off water to non-essential businesses. Leaks were forcingthe city to pump more than 18 million gallons of water a day,almost double the normal 10 million gallons.   Thousands of acres of produce froze in the fields of Floridaover the long weekend, and experts said wholesale prices beganclimbing Wednesday because of the short supply of tomatoes, bellpeppers, lettuce, cucumbers and other vegetables.   ``Everything has just tripled in price. Green cabbage was doingabout $8.75 (a box) and they're asking over $20 for it now,'' saidPaul Graff, manager of the Len Strom brokerage in Miami. ``Zucchiniis way up in the $25 range, which was between $11 and $12 before,and so it goes.''   Prices will begin climbing in the markets of the Midwest andNortheast within a week, said Reggie Brown, spokesman for theFlorida Fruit and Vegetable Association in Orlando.   Production in California and Mexico should ease the shortagessomewhat, he said, but prices are likely to remain high for threemonths, until Florida farmers can replant.   The weather put a damper on tourism around Orlando, Fla., inwhat is normally one of the busiest weeks of the year, but resortoperators around Walt Disney World and elsewhere hoped the returnof 60- and 70-degree sunshine would turn that around by year's end.   Hotel occupancy and attendance at attractions began picking uprapidly Wednesday.   ``Between Christmas and New Year's, it's usually a bonanza. Butthis year, no,'' said Ron Caimano, general manager of the EmbassySuites hotel in Orlando, where occupancy Tuesday was just 75percent.   The big chill wasn't all bad news, though.   While it was bringing the rare thrill of a white Christmas tosome, it may have been killing off millions of fleas, ticks, gnats,mosquitoes and flies, said Frank Funderburk, an extension agent inBibb County, Ga.   ``It's hard to say what nature is going to do,'' Funderburksaid, ``but the insects that bother man should be less in numberearly in the summer.''   Unfortunately, household pests like cockroaches probablysurvived, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
