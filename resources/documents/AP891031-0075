RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Nebraska agency will not be allowed to forcepublic employees who supervise the mentally retarded to undergotesting for AIDS, under a new Supreme Court order.   ``Obviously I'm disappointed,'' said Don Moray, director ofEastern Nebraska Community Office of Retardation, after the highcourt Monday turned aside his agency's appeal to require testing.   ``We believed in the policy very strongly as a means ofprotecting our clients,'' Moray said. Workers were never testedunder the policy.   The justices, who have never ruled on the lawfulness of AIDStesting, let stand decisions that blocked the agency from imposingmandatory blood testing of employees who come into direct contactwith the mentally retarded people the agency serves.   The Bush administration urged the court to leave intact a ban onthe tests imposed by lower courts. Justice Department lawyers saidthe lower court rulings comply with Constitution's ban onunreasonable government searches and seizures.   In other developments, the Supreme Court:   _Agreed to settle a dispute in which federal protection for 30million American workers' pensions could be at stake. The courtwill decide what authority the federal Pension Benefit GuarantyCorporation has to order employers to revive scrapped pension plans.   _Agreed to decide whether the Port Authority of New York and NewJersey, and perhaps other multi-state agencies, may be sued infederal courts.   _Said it will use a Chicago drug case to consider expanding theauthority of police to search homes without court warrants.   _Was urged during an oral argument session to strike down as``taxation without representation'' a federal judge's order thatdoubled local property taxes to pay for racially desegregatingKansas City, Mo., public schools.   _Heard arguments over a challenge to the partial merger ofDetroit's two daily newspapers.   _Rejected, in a Virginia case, arguments that states must notfavor the clergy over secular humanists in licensing people toperform weddings.   _Barred a lawsuit against the Christian Science church by aMichigan couple whose 15-month-old boy died after they, as churchmembers, were counseled to rely on faith healing and avoid seekingmedical help.   The AIDS testing case focused on the Nebraska agency's 1987policy requiring some employees to submit to blood testing for thevirus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   The contagious disease attacks the body's immune system,rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood,blood products or semen from infected persons.   The incurable condition is believed caused by a virus called thehuman immunodeficiency virus or HIV.   The Nebraska agency said it wants to test its workers becauseretarded clients can engage in violent conduct such as biting orscratching. An infected worker could then pass on the virus toother clients, the agency suggested.   But U.S. District Judge Lyle Strom barred the tests when workerssued, and his ruling was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals.   The chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men andintravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases isattributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexualcontact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring.   As of Aug. 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 105,990Americans, of whom 58 percent, or 61,655, have died since June 1,1981, according to the Center for Disease Control. No one is knownto have recovered from AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
