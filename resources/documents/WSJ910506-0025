One of the two striking unions voted to return to work andthe other union is expected to do the same this week. Theunions, affiliates of the United Steelworkers of America,reached a tentative contract agreement with the company lastweek.</LP><TEXT>   Brunswick Mining officials say the roughly 1,400 employeeswould be called back to work immediately once the strike isover, although it could take some time for operations tobuild up to full capacity. Management has been running themine and smelter, near Bathurst, New Brunswick, at about 30%capacity since the strike began in July.   Brunswick Mining, 64%-owned by Noranda Inc., a naturalresources concern based in Toronto, is Canada'ssecond-largest zinc and lead producer. At peak capacity,Brunswick estimates its production accounts for roughly 5% ofthe Western world's zinc output and about 1.5% of its lead.   Such an addition to world metal supplies normally would beexpected to depress market prices, already battered by weakdemand as a result of economic recession. However, because ofthe length of time required for Brunswick Mining to resumeall operations and to process the ore, the new supplies ofmetal might not reach the market until an expected economicrecovery is under way, suggests Julian Baldry, senior mininganalyst at Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.   &quot;We would expect to see the real impact of the {strike}settlement about six months from the day they go back towork,&quot; Mr. Baldry says. &quot;The indications are that economicconditions are improving and {the additional metal supplies}won't have that much impact.&quot;   Weak demand for zinc and lead, and the recent slump inmarket prices, reflect to a large degree a slowdown in theautomobile industry, a major consumer of both metals.Friday's closing prices on the London Metal Exchange were 51cents a pound for zinc and 26 cents a pound for lead. In1990, zinc and lead prices averaged 69 cents and 37 cents,respectively.   Brunswick Mining executives say the company plans tooperate its lead smelter at partial capacity until the fall,mainly because of weak demand. They also expect it will takeabout 10 weeks to reach full production at the zinc-leadmine.   Wendell MacCormack, president of Local 7085, whichrepresents the smelter workers, says the new three-yearcontract provides 2.80 Canadian dollars (U.S.$2.44) an hourin wage gains over the life of the pact. The current startingwage is C$13.40 an hour, he says.   Union and company officials say both sides compromised toend the lengthy walkout, which has brought hardship to thelocal resource-based economy. The roughly 400 smelter workershave approved the new contract, while the mineworkers,numbering about 1,000, are scheduled to vote Wednesday.   Kevin Irvine, a vice president of Local 5385, whichrepresents the mineworkers, says he believes his union willapprove the new contract. &quot;We explained to the members thatthere's no more there&quot; to be won from the company, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
