As gongsbeat and cymbals clash, the former Catholic nun is besiegedby swarms of giddy children and grateful elders.   After rounds of handshakes and hugs, Ms. Villareal turnsthe welcoming ceremony into impromptu research. She summonsall five-year-olds to sing a song. While they perform, shedoes a quick head count and gauges the boy-girl ratio. &quot;I dothis to see if they are lying to me,&quot; she says. &quot;Now I cansee how this population has been growing.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It isn't easy to fool this Filipino aid worker, who isleading a United Nations effort to rescue China's ruralfamily planning program. The Chinese government is finding itever harder to strong-arm Chinese women into limiting theirfamilies, especially in the impoverished hinterlands. Soinstead of force, Ms. Villareal has concocted a program thatcombines gentle persuasion with hard cash.   By mixing IOUs, IUDs and the profit motive, she ispenetrating the outback of the world's last Communist giantwith an innovative program. Contraceptive Capitalism, youcould call it.   The details are complex, but the idea is simple: Turnunschooled peasant women into entrepreneurs, making them toobusy, and too successful, to want to have broods of babies.&quot;You can't move the Chinese unless there's money involved, nomatter what they say about Mao and all that,&quot; says the56-year-old Ms. Villareal. &quot;I knew I needed a capitalist waythat fit well in this socialist society.&quot;   Despite one of the strictest birth-control programs in theworld, overpopulation continues to be China's paramountproblem. China has as many people -- some 1.15 billion -- asEurope and North America and South America combined. It growsby 46,000 people a day. Chinese researchers say the country'sland mass and resources are best suited for a maximumpopulation of about 700 million.   China estimates that since its strict one-child policybegan in 1979, the country has avoided 200 million births.But the program has incurred severe criticism for its harshsanctions, including heavy pressure to have abortions. And inany case, the policy now is crumbling where it most matters-- in the countryside, where 70% of people live. Nowhere isthe fragile equation of Chinese life -- supporting 22% of theworld's population on 7% of the world's arable land -- morevisible than the unforgiving farmlands of the remotenorthwest.   Here in Gansu Province, a vast moonscape of dry gulchesand hardscrabble farms, the soil is so parched that itcrackles underfoot. Farmers scatter rocks on their fields tocatch condensation when night turns to day. Yet this land ofcave dwellings, mud huts and minority tribes is swamped withchildren. They have dirt-smeared faces, tattered clothing andthe hard-eyed stare of the malnourished. Many families havethree or four, some have five or six.   Perhaps partly because the breakup of communes has giventhese peasants a sense of economic independence, they havebeen returning to large families, on the premise that morechildren mean a better life -- extra field hands, and care inold age. In fact, it is a vicious circle, says Yuan Shaofu, aBeijing economic development official: &quot;The more childrenthey have, the poorer they become, and the poorer theybecome, the more children they have. We have to link thepeasant's interests with the state's.&quot;   The U.N. system does this by concentrating not onpenalties but on profits. It works in a circuitous way bylending money to rural enterprises, whose loan repayments arechanneled to women's groups. Armed with this borrowed cash,the women turn into entrepreneurs.   Along the way, loan interest is used to establish women'sclinics and training classes for child care, family planning,literacy and personal finance. The idea is to build smalleconomic systems run by women in poor villages. In turn, thewomen's groups provide a forum for peer pressure to promotefamily planning.   Why not simply start the women's groups and skip the loansand entrepreneurship? The answer is, as Ms. Villarealrealized, that the Communists would never accept outsidersorganizing citizens' groups. But she knew that foreigninvestors often can call their own shots. So she turned birthcontrol into an investment program. &quot;To get to this level inChina, I've had to buy my way in,&quot; she says. &quot;There is no waywe could just come in here and form women's groups.&quot;   The program was patched together through trial-and-errorby Ms. Villareal, whose varied background seems to help herinstinctively figure out a place as confusing as China. Shespent much of her childhood slogging through the Philippinejungles with her father's band of anti-Japanese guerrillas.In the 1960s, she was a nun in America, working as apsychological counselor and studying economics at FordhamUniversity. Today, she shuffles about dusty Chinese villagesin white sneakers and pressed blue jeans, a cigarette alwaysdangling from her lips.   Ms. Villareal calls the shots on the U.N. Population Fundinvestments, which now total $5.8 million in 36 factories insix Chinese provinces. In Longxi County, the U.N. backed acarpet factory and a noodle factory, which Ms. Villarealfound with the help of China's trade ministry. The U.N.donated the money to the county, which lent it to thefactories. They must repay in three annual installments.   A clinic in each factory is set up as a family planningand health-care center. They have links to other communities.The carpet factory has spread into remote mountain villageswhere some 750 women make carpet pieces. More than 8,000peasant families now supply potatoes and wheat to thevermicelli noodle factory. The factory's byproduct wastefeeds pigs.   Pigs like those raised by Liu Lifang. Perched on a tinywooden stool in her one-room, mud-walled home, Mrs. Liuwatches her two-year-old toddle across the dirt floor. Shesays he will be her only child.   &quot;My parents had six children. My husband has fivebrothers. But if we follow this tradition of a big family,our lives won't get any better,&quot; the red-cheeked 26-year-oldsays. &quot;I need to spend my time earning money to improve ourlives.&quot;   Mrs. Liu says that her focus has changed from raisingbabies to tending pigs. Like most of her neighbors, she andher husband are accustomed to living on the edge. In goodyears, they have earned near the $60 annual per capita incomein this impoverished region by growing watermelons and wheat.But in her women's group, Mrs. Liu studied loans along withbirth control and literacy.   The women were given a year to devise new sources ofincome for their villages. Then, when the factory repaid itsfirst loan installment to the county, the county lent themoney to the women's groups. Mrs. Liu borrowed some of it tobuy pigs. Now she has 14. She says she spends about the yuanequivalent of $55 to purchase and raise a pig that sells for$85 to far-wealthier Chinese in the cities.   As the money rolls in, she sketches her plans for a newhome. It will be a three-room house made of bricks, concreteand wood instead of straw and mud. Mrs. Liu figures that by1995 she will have saved the $1,500 she needs to build it.   Other groups are using their loans not to buy pigs but tomake handicrafts or plant new varieties of crops. Like thefactories' loans, the women's loans must be repaid in threeannual installments, with the money then re-lent to othergroups.   &quot;Women are asking when we are going to start another group-- everybody wants to get in,&quot; says Li Yuzhuo, the leader ofMrs. Liu's group. &quot;The women learn how to earn money and theyalso give each other a lot of peer pressure not to have toomany children.&quot;   This program could be important to U.N. family planners aswell as to China. The U.S. in the mid-1980s canceled its $46million annual contribution to the U.N. Population Fund toprotest China's heavyhanded policies. But U.N. populationworkers have stayed in China, trying to soften thegovernment's worst tendencies.   &quot;Imagine the starvation and horror if China didn't dofamily planning&quot; at all, says Sterling Scruggs, director ofthe U.N. fund's Beijing office. He argues that &quot;the U.N. hasexposed the Chinese program to global influences andprinciples.&quot;   The U.N. is working to reduce abortions by pumping moneyinto modern contraceptive factories. Some 60 million womenuse a Chinese-made steel ring IUD that has a failure rate ofmore than 10%. This alone leads to most of China's 10 millionto 11 million abortions a year. The U.N. is financingfactories for &quot;Copper T&quot; IUDs, which are more reliable.   &quot;Look, our central planning system has problems,&quot; saysWang Bing, a senior Gansu economic development official, ashe walks by young women sitting on straw mats bundlingnoodles for packaging. &quot;The U.N. coming in here acts as acatalyst. It gets us all to cooperate and brings in new ideasand skills that get things moving.&quot;   The U.N. program has been operating less than two years,so it is impossible to tell whether participants will stickto the one-child policy that is strongly encouraged by theirwomen's groups. But officials from the U.N., the tradeministry and the Agricultural Bank of China have discussedthe possibility of China duplicating the U.N. program withdomestic bank loans.   &quot;You can't change things in China or anywhere else unlessyou can first show them a way,&quot; says Ms. Villareal. &quot;The goodthing about China is that if they see something that works,you don't have to tell them to expand it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
