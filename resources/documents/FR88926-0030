L. 100-358, approved June 29, 1988. Those changes includecreation of a separate title of the 1937 Act for Indian housing, changesto definitions, requirements for property standards, and restrictions relatedto admission in the Mutual Help homeownership program. This rule also authorizesexecution of an Annual Contributions Contract between an Indian housingauthority and HUD before a project has received final HUD approval (``developmentprogram'' approval), to provide a financing mechanism for a project's preliminarycosts now that the program has been converted from a loan program to agrant program, as authorized by section 112 of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-242 (February 5, 1988), and as providedfor in recent Appropriations Acts.  A rulemaking proceeding is already underway to separate the regulationsdealing with the Indian housing program from the regulations dealing withpublic housing generally and to consolidate the provisions applicable toIndian housing into a single part_Part 905. However, since that rule hasnot yet culminated in a final rule, this rule amends the currently effectiverules governing the Indian housing program_Parts 905, 913, and 942. Thisrule also amends Part 813, which governs the Section 8 programs, sinceone of the changes in definitions made by the 1988 Act affects programsoperated under the 1937 Act by Indian housing authorities (IHAs) and someIHAs administer Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment programs.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> <T3>Comment Due Date:</T3> November 25, 1988.  <T3>Effective Date:</T3> September 26, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Interested persons are invited to submit comments regardingthis rule to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Room10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh StreetSW., Washington, DC 20410-0500.

First, it creates a new titleII of the 1937 Act establishing a separate program of assisted housingfor Indians and Alaska natives. It generally incorporates into the revampedauthority the provisions of title I (the remainder of the 1937 Act) asof the date of enactment of the 1988 Act, and provides that future amendmentsto title I will not apply to Indian housing, ``unless the provision explicitlyprovides for such applicability.''  Second, the 1988 Act makes section 227 of the Housing and Urban-Rural RecoveryAct of 1983, concerning pet ownership in projects for the elderly and handicapped,inapplicable to lower income housing developed by Indian housing authorities.Third, the 1988 Act specifically adopts in the statute some of HUD's regulatoryprovisions and makes a few minor modifications in them in the process.Fourth, it establishes a new initiative: a Self-Help program to be modeledafter Farmers Home Administration's program and implemented as part ofthe existing HUD Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunity program.  The proposed consolidated Indian housing rule was published on June 29,1988, requesting public comments by September 27, 1988 (53 FR 24554). Thatrulemaking will proceed to a final rule, implementing Congressional intentthat a separate program for Indian housing be created, governed by regulationspromulgated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.553(b) through (e)) and in consultation with Indian housing authorities,and henceforward reflecting only changes in the 1937 Act that are specificallymade applicable to Indian housing.  This rule implements the exclusion of Indian housing from the programscovered by Part 942, which provides that no owner or manager of federallyassisted housing for the elderly or handicapped may prohibit or preventa tenant from owning or having common household pets living in the tenant'sunit or from discriminating against any person with respect to admissionor continued occupancy on the basis of the person's ownership or possessionof pets. This rule makes no change to section 227's applicability to conventionalpublic housing under title I of the 1937 Act, or to any of the other programsto which section 227 applies. This rule also implements the numerous elementsof the 1988 Act that amend the 1937 Act to adopt existing HUD policy, withminor modifications.  The vast majority of regulations changes occasioned by the 1988 Act eitherendorse existing HUD policies currently found in HUD field directives orin contract provisions, such as the requirement for property standardsadopted locally and the requirement for periodic IHA inspections of MutualHelp homes; or constitute minor changes to existing regulatory provisions,such as the revision to the definition of an Indian Housing Authority tospecifically include regional housing authorities in the State of Alaska,or the addition of an income deduction for excessive travel expense relatedto employment or education. The primary purpose of this rule is to revisecurrent regulations to include these items.  There are two changes included in this rule that significantly differ fromcurrent program operations. One is the provision that the Mutual Help HomeownershipOpportunity program operated on Indian reservations and in Indian areasserve primarily Indian families. The second change is an indirect resultof the 1988 Act's treatment of families whose incomes are above the incomelimits for lower income families. (The addition in this rule of regulatoryauthority for execution of an ACC before approval of a development programdoes not constitute a significant difference from the practice that hasevolved, out of necessity, of waiving the current regulatory prohibitionagainst execution of an ACC at this stage for all IHAs that have soughtit.) Implementation of the new Self-Help component of the Mutual Help HomeownershipOpportunities program, which is required to be established by the 1988Act, is being done separately since it is easily separable and it involvesa new initiative.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Section 201 of the 1937 Act  </ITAG>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 201, added by section 2 of the 1988 Act,establish a separate program to provide lower income housing on Indianreservations and other Indian areas under a new title II of the 1937 Actand provide that, in the future, the Indian housing program will be unaffectedby changes to title I of the 1937 Act unless those changes are stated byCongress to be applicable to Indian housing. These provisions are beingcarried out by implementation of the various other provisions of the 1988Act, by the development of the Consolidated Indian Housing rule, referencedabove, and by the limitation of future title I-based changes to that consolidatedrule to those identified as intended to be applicable to Indian housing. Section 201(c) merely exempts Indian housing from coverage by section 227of the 1983 Act, the statutory provision concerning pet ownership in assistedhousing for the elderly or handicapped. As such, the Department views itas a ``self-executing'' provision that became effective upon enactmentof the Indian Housing Act of 1988 on June 29, 1988. Part 942, therefore,imposes no restriction upon Indian Housing Authority (IHA) discretion toregulate or not regulate the ownership and keeping of pets in their developments.This discretion may, however, be limited by other laws that are not affectedby the Indian Housing Act of 1988 or today's rulemaking, such as any applicablerequirements for animals that assist handicapped persons.  The proposed consolidated Indian housing rule contained in provisions thatwould have applied pet restrictions similar to those of Part 942 to Indianhousing (andSection; 905.301(d)). Enactment of section 201(c) of the 1937Act moots these provisions, and they will not appear in the final in thatrulemaking.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Section 202 of the 1937 Act  </ITAG>a. Establishment of Mutual Help Program; HUD Financial Assistance  Section 202 of the 1937 Act, as amended by section 2 of the Indian HousingAct of 1988, provides the statutory foundation for the Mutual Help HomeownershipOpportunities program, which has been in existence for many years. Paragraphs(a) and (b) of that section make no change in the nature of the program,and therefore require no change in the regulations that already embodytheir provisions.  b. Eligible Projects  Paragraph (c) addresses building types, forms of ownership, and propertystandards. The description of building types specifically authorizes single-familydwellings in the form of row houses, so this rule amends andSection; 905.103(b)to specifically mention that type of single-family dwelling. The discussionof forms of ownership gives the Secretary the discretion to facilitatecooperative ownership for any Mutual Help project for which the IHA hasrequested that form of ownership. Since the Secretary does not believethat this form of ownership is particularly appropriate for Mutual Helpprojects, no amendment to the regulations is being made at this time inresponse to this statutory provision.  The statutory language on property standards simply requires that theybe established by regulation, that they provide flexibility to use differentdesigns and materials, and that they include cost-effective energy conservationperformance standards. The House Committee Report states that the Committeeassumes that HUD's ``current practice [of] utilizing model building codes,or a State, local or tribal building code, will be continued.'' H. Rep.604, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. at 8. The report also praises HUD's abolishmentof minimum property standards, stating that IHAs have been able to developunits using traditional designs and materials that were not possible whenHUD had prescribed Minimum Property Standards. Consequently, this rulerevises andSection; 905.212, dealing with the design of the homes, to requirethat each IHA coordinate with the tribe, or local government, if appropriate,to assure adoption of a building code applicable to the homes built withHUD assistance that permits flexibility of design and cost-effective energyconservation performance.  c. Eligible Families  Paragraph (d) describes what families are eligible for participation inthe Mutual Help program on Indian reservations and other Indian areas.It emphasizes participation by lower income Indian families. Non-lowerincome families also may participate ``if the Indian housing authoritydemonstrates to the satisfaction of [HUD] that there is a need for housingfor such families that cannot reasonably be met without such assistance.''A numerical limit on the over-income families that can be housed is statedin the statute. Non-Indian families also may participate ``if the Indianhousing authority determines that the presence of the family on the Indianreservation or other Indian area is essential to the well-being of Indianfamilies and the need for housing for the family cannot reasonably be metwithout such assistance.''  The topic of income limits is addressed in the current andSection; 905.302.Generally, the highest income that a lower income family may have is 80percent of the median income for the area, adjusted for family size. However,andSection; 905.302(a)(2) states that an IHA may request that HUD increasethe income limits for determining who is a ``lower income family'' wherefamily incomes are unusually high and where decent housing is not availableeven for families of higher income, thereby transforming families who wouldotherwise be classified as over-income into ``lower income families.''This regulatory provision is based on section 3(b)(2) of the 1937 Act,which permits the Secretary to establish income limits for lower incomefamilies higher or lower than 80 percent of the median income if the Secretaryfinds that such a variation is necessary ``because of prevailing levelsof construction costs or unusually high or low family incomes.''  The 1988 Act provides a method of allowing over-income families to participatein the MH program without affecting the level of the income limits. Itprovides that, in an area where housing for a higher income family is unavailable,such a family may be admitted to the program if the project's limit onthe number of units for such families is not exceeded. The statutory restrictionon the number of non-lower income families is the greater of ten percentof the units in the project, or five units.  The Department has used the authority in section 3(b)(2) of the 1937 Actand in andSection; 905.302(a)(2) to permit IHAs to serve families whose incomeswere above the standard income limits for the area by raising the incomelimits, primarily because of the unavailability of other housing resourcesto serve them. However, the need to raise income limits in Indian areasto serve higher income families has decreased over the past few years.On August 1, 1986, a final rule implementing a program of FHA mortgageinsurance on Indian lands became effective (51 FR 21866, amending 24 CFRParts 200, 203, etc.). This program can provide an alternative financingsource where lenders are willing to participate. Section 103 of the Housingand Community Development Act of 1987 made inapplicable to lower incomehousing administered by IHAs the requirement imposed by statute in 1981that most families admitted be not only lower income but very low income.In addition, concern has increased about the unintended effect on FarmersHome Administration and Treasury tax-exempt programs of the higher incomelimits that have been used for Indian housing in some areas. And now Congresshas provided another way to permit this program to serve families whoseincomes are above the standard income limits in areas where ``there isa need for housing for such families that cannot reasonably be met withoutsuch assistance.''  Therefore, the Department intends to rely on the exception process addedby this rule to andSection; 905.406 on selection of homebuyers in the MutualHelp program to implement the 1988 Act's provision for permitting familiesof higher income to participate in Indian housing. Section 905.302 is alsobeing revised to more closely track the language of section 3(b)(2) ofthe 1937 Act on which it is based, removing the reference to the relativeunavailability of other housing even for families of relatively high income.Only in extremely unusual cases, where an IHA has exceeded the unit limitfor non-lower income families in its Mutual Help program or where it hasonly rental program units, will HUD consider an IHA's request under therevised andSection; 905.302 to raise the income limits for the area.  The Department has considered the validity of the admissions restrictionin favor of Indian families and continues to have several legal concerns.During consideration of H.R. 3927, HUD observed that section 202(a) raisedsignificant Constitutional civil rights concerns, since the bill appearedto target assistance to members of a particular racial group. The Departmentof Justice took a similar position before signature of the bill. In addition,IHAs are generally subject to either tribal or State laws, which may conflictwith the admissions restriction in the Act. Since it is recognized thata majority of residents who receive assistance under this program are Indians,few issues involving the admissions restriction favoring Indians are anticipated.Of course, it is expected that IHAs will evaluate the applicable laws inimplementing any admissions restriction. If a non-Indian believes thatthe restrictions as applied to him or her violate some legal principle,he or she should be referred to HUD for review of the issues raised inthat case.The admissions restriction is added in this rule to andSection; 905.406(a).Since the 1988 Act requires that admission of non-Indian families be restrictedto those determined by the IHA to be essential to the well-being of Indianfamilies (and only where other housing resources are not available), therule requires that the IHA include in its admissions regulations the criteriait will use for determining who is ``essential to the well-being of Indianfamilies.''In addition, HUD has determined that actions taken by IHAs to implementthe admissions preference do not constitute a violation of either TitleVI or Title VIII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, respectively.The section dealing with the applicability of Titles VI and VIII to Indianhousing (andSection; 905.105(b)) is amended accordingly.d. Mutual Help and Occupancy AgreementSection 202(e) of the 1937 Act, as amended, establishes the essential elementsof the mutual help and occupancy agreement to be executed by an IHA anda homebuyer. It covers the topics of the Mutual Help contribution, themonthly payment, the administration charge, responsibility for maintenanceand utilities, and the type of opportunity to be afforded for home purchase.The provision concerning the MH contribution is different from the previousstatutory foundation for the program, in that it expressly authorizes acontribution in the form of cash. (Section 203 of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 1437f note, authorized the use of specialschedules of required payments for participants in mutual help housingprojects who contribute <T3>labor, land, or materials </T3>for development.) HUD regulations forthe program do already include cash as an approved form of contribution.Section 202(e) differs from current regulatory provisions in that it prescribesa minimum contribution of $1,500 for <T3>each </T3>family, instead of a minimum <T3>average </T3>contribution of $1,500, and it permits a tribe to makeany form of contribution other than labor, instead of permitting a tribeonly to contribute land. This rule revises andSection; 905.408 to make thesechanges.The provision concerning the monthly payment is virtually the same as thecontent of andSection; 905.416. The reference in section 202(e)(2)(B) tothe applicability of section 203 of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1974 to monthly payments in this program has no real impact, sinceit merely authorizes the special schedules for mutual help that have longbeen the practice and have been embodied in regulation in language thatis nearly identical to the language of section 202(e)(2)(A). Consequently,no change is needed.The description of the administration charge in section 202(e)(2)(A) refersto an amount budgeted by the IHA to reflect the costs for ``the dwellingof the family.'' Therefore, this rule amends andSection; 905.419 to permitan IHA to tailor the administrative costs to reflect differences in expensesattributable to different unit sizes or types. As a result, the administrationcharge for MH homebuyers occupying units of different sizes in the sameproject could be different. However, since allocating costs in this mannercould be administratively burdensome and not cost-beneficial, it is permitted,but not required.The provision dealing with maintenance and utilities responsibilities makesit clear that the MH homebuyer must assume them, but that the IHA mustmonitor performance. Section 202(e)(3) requires each IHA to have in effectHUD-approved procedures to ensure ``the timely periodic maintenance ofthe dwelling by the family.'' Section 905.418 of the current rule requireshomebuyers to provide maintenance and to pay for their own utilities. Italso provides that if the IHA determines that homebuyer maintenance hasbeen inadequate, it can arrange to have necessary work done and chargethe cost to the hombuyer's account. Section 905.306 of the current rulerequires the IHA to adopt procedures for IHA inspections of homes (andcommon property, if any), but does not require IHA inspections on any particularschedule. This rule revises andSection; 905.417, which deals with inspectionsof the home during warranty and at termination of the agreement, to coverperiodic inspections as well. It adds a new paragraph (c), requiring theIHA to perform an inspection of the inside and outside of the home at leastannually (as currently required by the ACC) and to furnish the homebuyerwith an inspection report, in furtherance of enforcement of the requirementthat the hombuyer furnish all necessary maintenance of the home.The home purchase opportunities provision of the 1988 Act requires theIHA to allow a homebuyer to purchase the dwelling unit outright, undera mortgage or loan agreement or under a lease-purchase agreement, withfinancing either from the IHA or a private party, when the IHA determinesin accordance with HUD requirements that the homebuyer is able to meetthe obligations of homeownership.Current regulations already provide for purchase by the homebuyer undera lease-purchase agreement (the Mutual Help and Occupancy agreement) ata purchase price established in a schedule when the agreement is signedto permit acquisition of title by payment of the purchase price and settlementcosts. Current regulations (andSection; 905.423) also provide standards fordetermining when a family is able to meet homeownership obligation. Section905.423 lists as prerequisites the ability to pay one-time closing costs,and ongoing costs for debt service, insurance coverage, taxes and specialassessments, a mortgage servicing charge, maintenance expenses and utilities.The changes needed on this issue are clarification that (1) in additionto the two methods specified for covering the purchase price (use of theamounts accrued in homebuyer accounts or IHA financing), the alternativeof financing from another qualified entity is possible; (2) the IHA isnot required to offer IHA financing; and (3) the IHA's notification toa family of its determination of eligibility to purchase should triggerefforts by the family to obtain private financing. Of course, if the familyis unable to obtain financing at this point, despite its apparent qualification,the IHA will not apply the sanction that would be applicable if the homebuyerdeclined to purchase the home when IHA or private financing was available(discontinuation of amortization of the purchase price under the purchaseprice schedule).The Department believes that current provisions satisfy section 202(e)(4)'srequirement for standards of determining eligibility of a homebuyer tocomplete purchase of the home and for the use of such financing optionsas a lease-purchase agreement. The Mutual Help and Occupancy Agreementcurrently used in the program is a lease-purchase agreeement, under whicha family leases a unit until such time as its balance in an equity accountequals the amount indicated on the purchase price schedule as the currentpurchase price (through the amortization reflecting the HUD subsidy), orthe time that the homebuyer arranges to pay the purchase price throughthe use of IHA or private financing. However, this rule does revise andSection;905.422(a) specifically to authorize purchase with financing from an outsidesource under the various options enumerated in the statute.e. Self-Help Mutual Help ProgramThe Self-Help component of the Mutual Help program established in paragraph(f) is the subject of another rulemaking, as described above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section 203</ITAG>a. Maximum Development CostAlthough the system of prototype development costs was statutorily repealedseveral years ago, current regulations still embody that system of limitingdevelopment costs. Paragraph (a) of section 203 requires HUD to establisha maximum contribution for development of a lower income housing project,taking into consideration such factors as ``(1) the logistical problemsassociated with projects of remote location, low density, or scatteredsites; and (2) the availability of skilled labor and acceptable materials.''These two statutorily required factors are derived from current HUD practice.To implement the statutory directive, this rule revises andSection; 905.213in its entirety to establish by regulation the Total Development Cost Standard,which has been in use by HUD since the repeal of prototype costs.b. Interdepartmental Agreement on Indian HousingThe 1988 Act requires HUD to take action necessary to obtain the timelyprovision of any roads, water and sewage facilities access, and electricaland fuel distribution systems needed for completion of Indian housing projects.HUD officials participate in regular meetings with officials of the otherparties to the Interdepartmental Agreement to assure adequate deliveryof these services. No rule is necessary to implement this provision.c. Accessibility to Physically HandicappedParagraph (c) directs the Secretary to require each IHA to give properconsideration to the needs of physically handicapped persons for readyaccess to lower income housing assisted under title II. To implement thisdirective, this rule revises andSection; 905.212, the provision concerningthe design of dwelling units, to cross reference 24 CFR Part 8, the rulerequiring accessibility of HUD-assisted housing to physically handicappedpersons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sections 204 and 205</ITAG>a. Annual ReportSection 204 requires the Secretary to report to Congress on implementationof various statutory initiatives related to Indians. That section willbe implemented when the Secretary submits his next annual report to Congress.b. Regulations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Justification for This Interim Rule</ITAG>Section 6 of the 1988 Act states that the Indian housing program shallbe administered only in accordance with its provisions effective at theearlier of the effective date of regulations or at the end of ``the ninetyday period beginning on the date of the enactment of [the] Act'', whichis September 26, 1988. The Department prefers to implement the 1988 Actby issuance of a rule rather than by issuing some other directive to IHAsby September 26, 1988.Section 205(a) of the 1937 Act, as amended, requires the Secretary to issueregulations to carry out the Indian housing program in accordance withthe Administrative Procedure Act (``the APA''), 5 U.S.C. 553(b) through(e). Those subsections generally require (1) publication in the FEDERALREGISTER of notice of a proposed rule, including a statement of its legalauthority and the substance of the rule or a description of the subjectsand issues involved (or actual notice to the affected public); (2) opportunityfor interested persons to participate by providing comments or testimony;(3) a statement in the final rule of the basis for the rule and its purpose;(4) publication of the final rule at least 30 days before its effectivedate; and (5) the right of interested persons to petition an agency forthe issuance or revision of a rule. The APA does recognize exceptions tothe requirements for publication of notice of a proposed rule and publicationof a rule for effect at least 30 days in advance: a finding by the agencyof good cause, stated in the rule. Subsection (b) elaborates on the meaningof good cause: When solicitation of prior public comment is ``impracticable,unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' All of these requirementsare found also in HUD's rule on rulemaking, 24 CFR Part 10.Section 205(b) of the 1937 Act, as amended, imposes an additional proceduralrequirement. It requires consultation with Indian housing authorities inthe development of proposed regulations implementing the Indian housingprogram. Section 205(c) directs the Secretary to issue regulations implementingthe Indian Housing Act of 1988 ``to become effective before the expirationof the 90-day period beginning on the date of [its] enactment.''In accordance with the APA and HUD's rule on rulemaking, the Secretaryfinds that there is good cause for omitting advance solicitation of publiccomment and publication of the rule because it is unnecessary and impracticable.It is unnecessary because most of the changes being made in existing rulesare relatively minor. The more substantive changes are made directly fromthe statute, with minimal embellishment. For example, the regulatory languageconcerning the Mutual Help program's admissions restrictions applied tonon-Indians is virtually verbatim from the statute, without any exerciseof discretion. The restrictions on admission to the Mutual Help programof families whose incomes exceed the limits for lower income families alsoare being implemented nearly verbatim from the statute, with an additionalrevision to a related provision that had been used to serve the same purpose.The latter revision is needed to make the related provision track the languageof its statutory authority, to assure that it will not be used to circumventthe new restrictions on admission of over-income families. In addition,the statutory deadline for making these changes effective makes the processof publishing a proposed rule and considering public comments before issuinga rule_and waiting for 30 days thereafter to make it effective, impracticable.The Department also finds that the requirement of section 7(o)(3) of theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development Act, 42 U.S.C. 3535(o)(3),that would delay the effectiveness of a final rule until 30 continuousdays of a session of Congress is in conflict with the directives to theDepartment contained in section 205 of the 1937 Act (as added by section2 of the 1988 Act) and in section 6 of the 1988 Act, described above. Compliancewith section 7(o) in this case would delay effectiveness of the rule untilsometime in March 1989, or would have required its publication by August10, 1988_merely 42 days after enactment of the 1988 Act. Consequently,the Department concludes that the 1988 Act supersedes the Department ofHUD Act with respect to the time that this rule can be made effective.Although this rule is not a proposed rule, the Department has consultedwith representatives of Indian housing authorities during its development,consistent with the requirements of section 205(b). The Department consultedwith the Executive Board of the National American Indian Housing Council(representing IHAs) and with a representative of the Housing AssistanceCouncil (an organization that works with rural housing groups) at a meetingin late July concerning the changes required by the 1988 Act. This rulewas also discussed with the Secretary's Indian and Alaska Native Committee(representing IHAs, tribes and national Indian organizations) at its meetingin late August. This interim rule reflects the suggestions made by theparticipants. There is one element of this interim rule that was not the subject of thosediscussions_the change in andSection; 905.302 to de-emphasize use of increasingincome limits as a method of serving over-income families. Since IHAs mayhave views on that change, the Department has decided to invite publiccomment on the rule, while nonetheless making it effective by the statutorydeadline. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rulemaking for Indian Housing Programs, Generally </ITAG>Since the APA is virtually adopted for HUD rulemaking in 24 CFR Part 10,section 205(a) does not require any change with respect to rulemaking forIndian housing programs. However, in developing proposed rules dealingwith Indian housing, the Secretary will observe the requirement of section205(b) for consultation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions </ITAG>Section 4 of the 1988 Act revises a few of the definitions in section 3of the 1937 Act, but most of the changes are minor clarifications. Themain exception is that the definition of adjusted income is revised toinclude an additional deduction for families assisted by IHAs: As an alternativeto the child care deduction, a deduction for excessive travel expensesis allowed for employment or education related travel, not to exceed $25per week. Each IHA should include in its admissions regulations the standardit uses for determining what travel expenses are ``excessive'' and thereforequalify for this deduction. The changes in definitions are reflected in revisions to the definitionsfound in andSection; 913.102, applicable to public and Indian housing programs.They are also found in andSection; 813.102, applicable to the Section 8 HousingAssistance Payments programs, since some IHAs operate Section 8 programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Earlier ACC execution </ITAG>Although not mandated by the 1988 Act, this rule makes a change urgentlyneeded by IHAs: recognition of the conversion of Indian housing from aloan program to a grant program and the associated change in timing ofexecution of an Annual Contributions Contract. Historically, the Indian housing program has used the preliminary loanprocess (as discussed in 24 CFR 905.209) to obtain funds to pay the costsof preliminary surveys and planning (including the costs of appraisals).In fiscal year 1987, the Department converted from a loans and annual contributionmethod to a grant method of funding development/modernization activityin the lower income public housing program. The Department's desire toeliminate loans from the new grant method has led to the need for a newmethod of funding preliminary costs. The method that has been used, by waiver of certain regulatory restrictions,is to execute an ACC for planning, under which grant funds can be madeavailable to an IHA to cover preliminary costs. The current restrictionsagainst this procedure are the requirement of andSection; 905.210 that anACC not be executed until HUD has approved the development program adoptedby the for a project and the requirement of andSection; 905.217(b) that HUDnot execute an ACC before final site approval. Preparation of a developmentprogram and completion of the site selection process require the use ofpreliminary planning funds. The Department has been inundated with requests from IHAs for waivers ofthese restrictions and earlier execution of the ACC. Since the Departmentwants to administer the program by regulation rather than by this exceptionprocess, and since this issue is of immediate importance to all IHAs, theDepartment is including in this interim rule the regulation changes necessaryto recognize ``front end'' ACCs as the established procedure. (See revisionsto andSection;andSection; 905.209, 905.210, and 905.217.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Certifications </ITAG>Environmental Review A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50 that implementssection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules DocketClerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. Impact on the Economy This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. Federalism Impact Executive Order 12612,<T3> Federalism,</T3> issued by the President on October 26, 1987, doesnot apply to this rule, since Indian tribes do not fall within the order'scoverage. Impact on the FamilyThe General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,<T3>The Family, </T3>has determined that this rule does not have potentialsignificant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule involvesa program of Federal financial assistance to lower income families throughhousing programs administered by Indian housing authorities. The changesmade in this rule to that program's definitions, property standards fornew construction, and restrictions related to admission do not have a significantimpact on families.Regulatory AgendaThis rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulationspublished on April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854), under Executive Order 12291and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Impact on Small EntitiesUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Departmentis required to consider whether a rule has a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities, and if so, whether the methodof implementing the objective avoids imposing a disproportionate impacton them. The undersigned certifies that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small Indian housing authorities.Paperwork Reduction ActThe following chart illustrates the public reporting burden of the twoinformation collections in this rule that have not yet received OMB approvaland been assigned OMB control numbers:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s200,12,12,12,12</C> <H1>Requirement</H1><H1>Respondents</H1><H1>Responses per respondent</H1><H1>Hours per response</H1><H1>Total hours</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Mutual help and occupancy agreement andSection; 905.422 <D>1,200 </D><D>1 </D><D>0.3 </D><D>360</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inspections <D>65,000 </D><D>1 </D><D>3.0 </D><D>195,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total burden hours <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>195,360</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>24 CFR Part 813Low and moderate income housing.24 CFR Part 905Grant programs: housing and community development; Grant programs: Indians;Low and moderate income housing; Public housing; Homeownership.24 CFR Part 913Public housing.24 CFR Part 942Public housing; Aged; Handicapped; Pets.Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR Parts 813, 905, 913, and 942as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 813_DEFINITION OF INCOME, INCOME LIMITS, RENT AND REEXAMINATIONOF FAMILY INCOME FOR THE SECTION 8 HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS PROGRAMSAND RELATED PROGRAMS</ITAG>1.
