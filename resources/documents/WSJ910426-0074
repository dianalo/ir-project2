Ross Perot, the feisty Texas billionaire, haslaunched his next crusade: penetrating Japan's byzantinedomestic computer market.   Perot Systems Corp., which specializes in choosing andmanaging complete computer hardware and software needs forcompanies, announced here that it had joined with one ofJapan's best-known computer software entrepreneurs to get achunk of this nation's growing &quot;systems integration&quot; market.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The key technologies are moving quickly&quot; in Japan, saidMr. Perot at a news conference. &quot;The systems andappplications do not.&quot;   His new partner, Masayoshi Son, president and founder ofSoftbank Corp., added: &quot;We are totally behind compared to theU.S.&quot;   Mr. Perot is the latest in an increasing number of U.S.computer hardware and software executives sensing newopportunity in Japan. Even companies with long ties here,such as International Business Machines Corp., have in recentmonths launched major new marketing strategies to boostsales.   A big reason is the growing feeling that the U.S.companies can provide services the Japanese don't. WhileJapanese computer and electronics companies make some of thebest equipment in the world, the way their own domesticmarket uses that machinery is considered inefficient andunderveloped. Hardware makers, most with incompatibleequipment, dominate the business, and the independentsoftware sector is weak.   Many analysts say Japan is behind in &quot;systemsintegration,&quot; a field in which Mr. Perot immodestly callshimself &quot;the daddy.&quot; His first company, Electronic DataSystems Corp., was an early leader in the field; it wasultimately sold to General Motors Corp.   Although it is difficult to compare numbers, &quot;Here inJapan the network system is very poor,&quot; says Junichi Saeki, acomputer analyst with Dataquest Japan Ltd. &quot;Most companieshave little experience in systems integration.&quot; At the newsconference, many of Japan's technology journalists asked Mr.Perot what exactly &quot;systems integration&quot; was.   Perot Systems invested about 175 million yen ($1.3million) for a 35% stake in a new Softbank subsidiary devotedto the integration service. Japanese employees will train atPerot Systems headquarters near Washington, D.C.   In Mr. Son, Mr. Perot said he found a kindred spirit. Justas Mr. Perot quit IBM in frustation to make his fortune, Mr.Son has shunned the traditional Japanese corporate route. Hefounded his company a decade ago a year after graduating fromcollege, and is credited with creating one of the firsthand-held computer translation devices.   Mr. Perot declined to project the joint venture's sales,but said he hoped to use the business in Japan to get agreater share of Japanese company's multinational operations.   But some analysts cautioned that Mr. Perot, like many aconfident U.S. executive before him, may find the Japanesemarket more difficult than it seems. &quot;Their partner isstrongly established in the PC area, but most systemsintegration needs stem from large-scale users,&quot; said YujiOgino of IDC Japan Ltd., &quot;so I don't know how they'll do.&quot;   Steven Myers, a technology analyst with Jardine FlemingSecurities Ltd., said that Japanese customers expect a lotmore from computer consultants, so &quot;there are all sorts ofcompromises that are necessary to be successful.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
