Moreover, the agency said Wednesday in a report, commercial banksthat specialize in farm finance are doing well compared with themid-1980s. By last summer, their returns on equity were up 40percent from 1987 and more than 150 percent above 1986.   ``The improving farm economy will save more agricultural banksfrom failure in 1989,'' the report said. ``Failures, after setting apost-Depression record of 75 in 1987, fell to 41 in 1988, and may bethe same to sharply fewer in 1989.''   Total bank failures, including agricultural institutions, may``be closer to 100'' in 1989 instead of more than 200 in each of theprevious two years, the report said.   At the height of the recent financial crunch, as plummeting landvalues cut sharply into assets, thousands of farmers owed so muchthat they couldn't qualify for additional credit to pay bills.   With the lid on further credit, farmers often liquidated orculled livestock herds, sold commodities held in storage and tookother steps to reduce debts. As this paydown took effect, banks andother lending institutions have eased back.   As a result, the report said ``creditworthy farmers should haveample access to operating credit'' for spring planting and otherproduction expenses this year.   ``Farm lenders are optimistic about financial conditions despitethe (1988) drought and do not think it will sidetrack the farmrecovery,'' the report said.   Major farm lending groups reported stronger portfolios in 1988and fewer farm loan delinquencies, loan charge-offs andforeclosures, it said. An exception was the department's FarmersHome Administration, which makes loans to the least creditworthyproducers, but ``indications are that it too is coming to grips''with its problems, the report said.   A major reason for the favorable farm financial outlook this yearwas said to be the continued strength in crop and livestockcommodity sales.   ``Better economic fundamentals also underlie long-run trends inagriculture,'' the report said. ``Farmland markets have improved andthe farm sector balance sheet (of assets and liabilities) hasstabilized.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farm and ranch inventories of cattle and calvesedged down again to a 28-year low of 99,484,000 head on Jan. 1 from99,524,000 a year ago, according to new Agriculture Departmentestimates.   But the decline has slowed and there were indications many beefproducers have started rebuilding their herds. A year ago, the U.S.cattle herd was down 2.4 percent from the 102 million head that hadbeen estimated Jan. 1, 1987. This year's decline was less than 1percent.   ``This slowed the recent downtrend in cattle inventories thatbegan six years ago and was the second consecutive inventory below100 million head since 1961,'' the department's AgriculturalStatistics Board said Wednesday.   The estimate was in line with recent predictions of USDAanalysts, who say the shrinkage in the overall cattle herd may bestarting to rebound. As producers hold back breeding stock torebuild herds, beef output is expected to decline in the short run.   Overall, according to USDA forecasts, 1989 beef production maydecline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year to the lowest levelsince 1980.   But large supplies of pork and poultry are expected and thatcould leave this year's total meat output at only slightly below therecord level of 1988. Even so, retail beef prices are expected toset records this year.   As of Jan. 1, the number of beef cows and heifers that havecalved totaled 43.9 million head, up 1 percent from a year ago, thefirst increase following six consecutive years of decline.   Beef cows were reported at 33.7 milion head, up 2 percent fromJan. 1, 1988, and dairy cows at 10.2 million head, down 1 percent.It was the smallest inventory of U.S. milk cows since 1872, thereport said.   The 1988 calf crop was estimated at almost 40.9 million head, up2 percent from 1987.   Analysts said the value of all cattle and calves as of Jan. 1 wasestimated at about $60.4 billion, up 16 percent from $52 billion ayear earlier. The average value was reported at $607 per head,compared with $523 the previous year.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An annual inventory report by the AgricultureDepartment shows that the nation's flock of sheep and lambsincreased slightly in 1988 for the third consecutive year.      The increase was only a small fraction of 1 percent, however,boosting the U.S. flock to an estimated 10,802,000 sheep and lambson Jan. 1 from 10,784,000 on Jan. 1, 1988.   Despite the recent gains, the Jan. 1 count was one of thesmallest in U.S. history, according to USDA records going back formore than a century.   In 1970, for example, there were 20.4 million sheep and lambs inthe nation's flocks. And in 1867, when USDA began counting sheep,there were about 46.3 million head. The industry peaked in 1942 at56.2 million.   ``Primarily the decline stems from less demand for wool as moresynthetics and cheaper substitute materials were introduced and thedeclining demand for lamb in consumer diets,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
