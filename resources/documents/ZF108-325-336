 Little in the description ofthis massive acquisition would serve as a model for future technologyprocurements.andM;Appendix B, &quot;Future of the Federal Work Force,&quot; contains a wealth ofdemographic information about federal white-collar workers.andP;  Subtitled &quot;AnOpportunity for Information Technology,&quot; the study puts a technology spin onother work force data, most notably forecasts produced by the LaborDepartment and the Hudson Institute, a policy research firm in Indianapolis.andM;The size of the federal government's civilian work force has remained stableduring the past 20 years, averaging 2.2 million.andP;  About half the workers areemployed in the Defense Department, and most of the others work in theCabinet-level departments, though shifts in employment levels from agency toagency have occurred.andM;Of the large agencies, only the Justice, Labor, Treasury and Veterans Affairsdepartments have shown continuous growth over the past 20 years, according tothe report.andP;  The federal work force is projected to grow only 2 percent to 3percent between 1986 and the end of the century.andM;One reason for this relative stability in the face of growing demand forservices has been the government's increasing reliance on contracting.andO;During the Reagan years, the report tells us, more contracting let executivebranch agencies eliminate 51,000 positions.andM;An important side effect of contracting is increased demand for contractingstaff, because of the volume and complexity of procurement actions.andP;  Anotherlies in creation of a &quot;shadow force&quot; of 3 million private-sector workerssubstituting for federal employees.andM;The Reagan administration also promoted the shift of responsibilities fromthe federal government to state and local jurisdictions.andM;As technology changes the nature of the federal work force from labor-intensive to information-based, the work force between now and the year 2000will be composed increasingly of white-collar jobs.andM;Some of the fastest growing federal occupations are in law, medicine, scienceand engineering.andP;  Supervision of the &quot;shadow&quot; work force will increase thedemand for procurement specialists.andP;  And increasing reliance on informationtechnology will require more computer people.andM;With most new jobs expected to be technical and professional, seriousrecruitment and staffing problems can be expected.andM;&quot;The majority of new work force members between now and the 21st century willbe women, minorities and immigrants,&quot; the report says.andP;  &quot;Women and minoritiesremain underrepresented in science and engineering fields.andM;&quot;In addition, minorities, as a group, have attained historically less formaleducation than whites.andP;  Unless these trends improve, women and minorities maybe unable to take advantage of the new job opportunities.&quot;andM;Moreover, although today's federal workers as a whole are better educatedthan the national work force, the future will require a continuous upgradingof their skills.andP;  More training will be required, and agency managers willhave to cope with an increase in the average age of their employees thatcould make it more difficult to motivate or retrain them.andM;Among the inferences drawn by this study is that the federal government is inthe midst of a &quot;quiet crisis.&quot;andM;&quot;Deficiencies in compensation and inflexible personnel practices arepreventing the federal government from recruiting and retaining the mostqualified skilled applicants,&quot; the report says.andP;  &quot;If this situation isallowed to continue, the government may have to settle for 'barely adequate'candidates and invest heavily in remedial training and occupationaldevelopment to attain a competent work force.&quot;andM;And what about the role of technology in ameliorating these problems?andP;  Thestudy rightly asserts &quot;that the federal government will increasingly need tolook to information technology as a resource for productivity improvement.&quot;andM;But it concludes pessimistically, and somewhat cryptically, that making useof such technology &quot;depends on the removal of existing disincentives thattend to discourage federal managers from taking full advantage of innovativetechnology.&quot;andM;Robert V.
