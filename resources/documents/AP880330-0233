It would be Italy's 48th government since World War II.   ``The forecast is by next week the Cabinet will be formed,''said Christian Democratic official Francesco D'Onofrio, who was atthe meeting.   President Francesco Cossiga tapped De Mita after Premer GiovanniGoria, also a Christian Democrat, resigned March 11. Many considerDe Mita, the leader of the dominant Christian Democrats, the mostpowerful politician in Italy.   Still, he has been forced to negotiate his program point bypoint with Craxi, who heads the second largest party in theproposed coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans,Social Democrats and Liberals.   De Mita told party leaders Wednesday that agreement was near onmost issues that must be resolved to win approval from the proposedcoalition parties, D'Onofrio said. The premier-designate said thatone difficulty still to be overcome was distribution of Cabinetposts, D'Onofrio reported.   He said De Mita also needs one important concession from his ownparty _ permission to remain party leader for another year.   Defections by Christian Democrats in secret votes in Parliamenthindered Goria's ability to govern from the beginning.</TEXT></DOC>
