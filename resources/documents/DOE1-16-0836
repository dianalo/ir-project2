The salting-out effect of cationsis a function of their classification in /sup t/ypes of acid/sup ./ Thesalting-out effect of the hard acid cations increases with the increasingof P/sub A/. Hard acid and borderline acids have different mechanismsin salting-out effect. The salting-out effect of Li/sup +/ and H/sup+/ is also discussed in the present work.</TEXT></DOC>
