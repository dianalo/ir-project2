The paper said former Secretary of State George P. Shultz,shortly before leaving office, asked U.S. law enforcement agenciesto provide ``any credible information'' on the matter, the Post said.   The newspaper reported the new Mexican government of PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari asked for the information, a request thatsome U.S. officials fear could compromise sensitive U.S.intelligence sources in that country.   Shultz, in a Jan. 13 letter obtained by the Post, said a seniorMexican government official had pledged that ``appropriateinvestigations and actions would be taken'' if the request wasfulfilled.   Shultz said, however, that the Mexicans needed the information``before it was made public in the press'' because the Salinasgovernment ``could not be perceived as responding to U.S. mediaallegations.''   The letter, which the Post said has not been answered by any U.S.agency, is the latest development in a growing dispute between U.S.law enforcement officials and the State Department over the newMexican government's commitment to cracking down on drug trafficking.   The Post said some U.S. officials have expressed concern thatsome of Salinas' top appointees, particularly in the attorneygeneral's office and other law enforcement agencies, may have tiesto major Mexican drug traffickers or have not shown full commitmentto eliminating drug-related corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
