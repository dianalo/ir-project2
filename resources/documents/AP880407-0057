A memorandum from EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas, madeavailable Wednesday, said the agency would not propose furtherregulations for benzene equipment leaks, which probably subject themost exposed individual to a one in 1,000 risk of leukemia.   The memo called on agency officials to draft regulationsessentially reaffirming the agency's decisions in 1984 not toregulate benzene exposure from the manufacture of ethylbenzene andstyrene, storage of benzene in tanks and the manufacture of maleicanyhydride; but to impose regulations on coke oven emissions andequipment leaks in chemical plants and refineries. The leaksregulations have been adopted; the coke oven regulations are stillonly a proposal.   A leading environmentalist attorney, David Doniger of theNatural Resources Defense Council, called the EPA move ``anoutrageous decision and a complete betrayal of the public healthobjectives of the Clean Air Act,'' saying the new standard willallow a level of risk 1,000 times what should be permitted.   But an agency spokesman said that only an estimated two peopleare exposed to a risk of greater than one in 10,000 under the EPAstandards.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Justice Changes Stand On Judicial Review Of Deportation for Asylum</HEAD><TEXT>   Seekers</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department is retreating from astand that would have barred aliens facing deportation from havingtheir asylum requests heard before an immigration judge.   Earlier rules proposed last Aug. 28 would have required that allclaims for asylum and withholding of deportation be heard by asylumofficers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.   Civil liberties groups say INS is unsympathetic toasylum-seekers, an accusation the agency denies.   Under the latest proposed revision, immigration judges _ whowork for the Justice Department, not INS _ would continue toconduct adversarial proceedings for those asylum-seekers facingexclusion from the United States or deportation.   The change ``is an important improvement,'' said Arthur Helton,a attorney for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.   Initial asylum applications will be heard by INS asylumofficers. But those officers will receive training from the JusticeDepartment.   The revised rule, published in the Federal Register, will becomefinal after a 30-day public comment period.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Chinese Crack Down on Hunters of Endangered Pandas</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chinese authorities have arrested 203 peoplefor illegal hunting of the endangered giant panda and recovered 146pelts, representing about one in seven of all pandas alive at thelast count, according to the World Wildlife Fund.   ``These are shocking revelations,'' William Reilly, president ofthe fund's U.S. affiliate, said in a statement Wednesday. ``Thesituation appears to be worsening for the panda,'' with the marchto extinction more advanced than previously believed and huntingthe greatest threat.   Reilly said it was the first time China had released suchdetailed statistics.   Forestry Minister Gao Dezhan, in a February report announcedthat 26 people have been sentenced to prisons terms ranging from ayear to life in connection with an investigation into poaching andfur trading in Sichuan Province in western China, where almost allpandas live.
