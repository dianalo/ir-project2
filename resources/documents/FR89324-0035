McMillen, Project Officer, Office of Navigation Safety and WaterwayServices; Mr. Paul Cojeen, Office of Marine Safety, Security and EnvironmentalProtection; and Lieutenant Commander Don M. Wrye, Project Counsel, Officeof Chief Counsel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The Coast Guard became concerned about bridge visibility in the late 1960'swhen container vessels and larger tankers with aft house arrangements wereconstructed. The configuration of these vessels created a blind zone directlyahead of the vessel in which vision from the navigation bridge was obscuredby the vessel's bow, permanent deck structures, or cargo containers. Merchant Marine Technical (MMT) Note 2-67, entitled ``Forward Visibilityfrom the Navigating Bridge and Pilothouses of Vessels'', was issued asan internal guide to assist the technical offices in evaluating bridgevisibility during vessel construction plan review. It established a visibilitycriteria that the forward blind zone should not exceed 1.25 times the lengthof the vessel. It also recommended that bridge wings extend to the widestbeam measurement of the vessel and be connected by a catwalk across thefront of the pilothouse. With regard to movable or temporary obstructionsto forward visibility, MMT Note 2-67 prescribed advisory comments to theplan submitter calling attention to the hazard. In case of permanent obstructionsto forward visibility which were not essential elements of the vessel'sconstruction or operation, the Note suggested that withholding plan approvalmight be appropriate. The Coast Guard emphasized to industry that the questionof adequate bridge visibility was largely an operational matter and thatit was the owner's responsibility to provide tugs, lookouts, or electronicvisibility aids to ensure safe operation of the vessel. As more large containerships, tankers and mobile offshore drilling unitscame into service, the Coast Guard's concern about bridge visibility increased.In June 1970, the Coast Guard published Commandant Note 5900 and addeda section to the Marine Safety Manual which formally established the CoastGuard's policy regarding navigation bridge visibility. This policy citedthe Coast Guard's statutory responsibility to ensure that a vessel is suitedfor the service intended. Under this policy, movable or temporary obstructions,such as container loading, were considered operational in nature and thematter was simply brought to the attention of the owner or operator. Forpermanent obstructions, certification was withheld in cases where, in theopinion of the Officer-in-Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), the visibilityfrom the navigation bridge was obstructed to the extent that the vesselcould not be safely navigated. The earlier 1.25L criteria was retainedand was the only quantitative guideline available to the OCMI.The Coast Guard's policy was modified again in 1976 when a three-positiontest was developed to account for vessels of unusual form, such as verylarge crude carriers (VLCCs) and liquid natural gas (LNG) tankers. Thethree positions included the ship's centerline in the wheelhouse, the wheelhousewindow and the bridge wing location. this, in effect, minimized the extensionof the ship's centerline into the blind zone. The three-position test introducednot only varied permissible forward extents of the blind zones, but maximumallowable widths of blind zones. Consideration for the effects of draftand trim changes was given. Unsatisfactory conditions were brought to theattention of the plan submitter.A regulatory effort was begun shortly after the three-position test waspublished. The Coast Guard published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPRM) on May 11, 1981 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (46 FR 26086). The ANPRM generated 47 commentsacknowledging that bridge visibility was a problem, but recommending thatthe Coast Guard first pursue an international agreement at the IMO. TheCoast Guard agreed to this approach and terminated proposed rulemakingby action in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated September 2, 1982 (47 FR 38707).In January 1982, the United States, through the Coast Guard, convincedthe IMO Subcommittee on Safety of Navigation to specifically address thesubject of bridge visibility. A three year effort spearheaded by representativesof seven major shipping nations, including the United States, as well asfive international associations, including the Internation Maritime PilotsAssociation, produced a document entitled ``Draft Guidelines on NavigationBridge Visibility''. These guidelines were approved by the Subcommitteeon Safety of Navigation and published in May of 1985 as Maritime SafetyCommittee (MSC) Circular 403. The standards for visibility from the navigation bridge proposed in thisrulemaking are derived from MSC/Cir.403. The requirements proposed to beincluded in Part 164 of Title 33, CFR, are operational in nature and wouldapply to all vessels insofar as the cargo loading and trim of vessels couldbe adjusted to meet or conform as closely as possible with the visibilityrequirements. No structural alterations would be required. The proposedregulations would apply to vessels of 1600 or more gross tons when operatingin the navigable waters of the United States. This tonnage criterion isused in the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, asamended, (SOLAS 74/83) and the Navigation Safety regulations (33 CFR Part164). It is proposed as the criterion for applicability of the proposedrequirements for 33 CFR Part 164 because the Coast Guard believes thatlarger vessels, particularly when navigating in confined waters, are mostvulnerable to problems related to visibility and have the greatest potentialto cause loss of life, injury, damage and pollution. The visibility standards derived from MSC Circular 403 are proposed tobe added to various subparts of Title 46 as requirements for design andconstruction of new U.S. vessels contracted for on or after [<T3>effective date of the final rule</T3>]. However, in Title 46 the proposedstandard of applicability will be vessels 100 meters (328 feet) or morein length. This criterion was chosen in order to be consistent with thestandard of applicability for manuevering performance regulations currentlyunder development. These proposed regulations are discussed in the nextparagraph. The IMO has decided on 100 meters (328 feet) as a more easilydetermined and universally agreeable standard of applicability for measuresaimed at large vessels than a tonnage criterion. In addition, there willbe a requirement in each of the affected parts in Title 46 to include avisibility plan as part of the design review stage. Identical text is proposed for addition to five parts in Title 46. Thesewill be Part 32 of Subchapter D, Tank Vessels; Part 72 of Subchapter H,Passenger Vessels; Part 92 of Subchapter I, Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels;Part 108 of Subchapter I-A, Mobile Offshore Drilling Units; and Part 190of Subchapter U, Oceanographic Research Vessels. As mentioned above, thedevelopment of this regulatory action is being coordinated with regulationscurrently being developed under docket CGD 80-136, Maneuvering PerformanceStandards for U.S. Flag Vessels. However, these two regulatory projectsare being proposed and published separately, therefore, the text of severalsections reserved in this rulemaking will be proposed in CGD 80-136. Publicationof final rules for these two regulatory projects will be coordinated toavoid confusion. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Proposed for Title 33, CFR </ITAG>Part 165 in Title 33, CFR is proposed to be amended to include definedarcs of visibility and limitations of blind sectors. All vessels of 1600or more gross tons would be required to comply as closely as possible tothe visibility requirements by their loading and arrangement to cargo andcargo gear, and trim of the vessel. Structural alterations or additionsof equipment would not be required. The exact requirements proposed aredescribed in paragraph (2) and (3) below, in the discussion of regulationsproposed for Title 46. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Proposed for Title 46, CFR </ITAG>1. Location of the Navigation Bridge Paragraph (a) of the proposed regulations would require the navigationbridge to be placed above all other decked structures on or above the maindeck. This is a fundamental design criterion for proper visibility bothahead and astern for conventional vessels and is universally accepted bydesigners and operators alike. 2. Limitations on the Forward Blind Zone Paragraph (b)(1) of the proposed regulations would establish the limitof the area on the surface of the water forward of a vessel which couldbe obscured. This limitation would not distinguish between the area obscuredby the vessel's structure (such as the flare of the bow) and that obscuredby cargo. Thus, the vessel's planned cargo capacity will be affected andshould be considered during the design stage. The Coast Guard is proposingthat from the conning position, the view of the sea surface must not beobscured by more than two ship lengths or 500 meters (1640 feet), whicheveris less. This area would span an arc of 20 degrees; 10 degrees from deadahead on either side of the bow. In addition, any blind sector within thisarc of visibility caused by cargo, cargo gear, or other permanent obstructionwould be limited to 5 degrees. These standards would apply regardless ora vessel's draft, trim, or deck cargo. 3. Field of Vision and Blind Sectors Paragraph (b)(2) of the proposed regulations would require the horizontalfield of vision from the conning position to extend from more than 22.5degrees abaft the beam on one side, through dead ahead, to more than 22.5degrees abaft the beam on the other side. This field of vision coincideswith the arcs of visibility of vessel navigation lights. It would alsoestablish the limit for the area forward of the vessel's beam in whichvisibility could be obstructed by cargo, cargo gear, etc. It would definemaximum horizontal arcs which could be obstructed and minimum horizontalarcs which must be clear. Paragraph (b)(3) of the proposed regulations would require the field ofvision from each bridge wing to extend from at least 45 degrees on theopposite bow, through dead ahead, to at least dead astern. This requirementwould ensure 360 degree visibility from the navigation bridge deck andestablish a minimum arc of visibility across the bow from each bridge wing.Paragraph (b)(4) of the proposed regulations would require the arc of visibilityfrom the main steering position to extend at least 60 degrees either sideof dead ahead. Although the helmsman may not act as the lookout requiredby the Rules of the Road, a minimum field of vision at the helm is a safetymeasure which benefits the helmsman and/or a deck officer monitoring thehelm. Paragraph (b)(5) of the proposed regulations would require the side ofthe vessel to be visible, forward and aft, from the respective bridge wings.This requirement would ensure visibility down the sides of the vessel sufficientto safely board pilots, employ and direct tugs, dock the vessel, etc. 4. Bridge WindowsParagraph (c) of the proposed regulations would establish requirementsfor the design and arrangement of windows on the navigation bridge. Thisis intended to minimize any obstructions to visibility caused by the designof the navigation bridge itself. Framing would be required to be kept toa minimum and not installed directly forward of any work station. Frontwindows on the bridge would be required to be inclined from the vertical,top out. Such an arrangement is intended to minimize glare from both thesun and the sea surface. The angle of inclination is proposed to be between10 and 25 degrees from the vertical. This was considered to be the optimalrange by the experts who developed the IMO guidelines and allows some flexibilityfor the designer and builder. Limitations on the height of the upper andlower edges of the front windows would be established, for obvious reasons.And finally, polarized or tinted windows would be prohibited. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and nonsignificant under DOT regulatory policies and procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic impact of this proposalhas been found to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary.Since navigation bridge visibility would, for new vessels, be consideredduring the preconstruction design and plan review stage, and for existingvessels function only as a matter of operational control, the minimal economicburden imposed by these regulations would be more than offset by the safetybenefits to the vessel itself, other waterway users, and the public. Under the regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>the Coast Guard must consider whether the proposed regulations,if adopted, are likely to have a significant econmic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. ``Small entities'' are defined as independentlyowned and operated small businesses which are not dominant in their fieldand which would otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' undersection 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632. The proposed regulations,if adopted, would affect owners and operators of self-propelled vesselsof 1600 or more gross tons or 100 meters (328 feet) or more in length.The construction cost and daily operating costs of vessels of this sizeare such that their owners and operators tend to be major corporationsor subsidiaries of such. Business entities with the capital and operatingcosts of this magnitude do not meet the definition of a ``small entity.''For the reasons stated above, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted,this proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Comments received in response to the ANPRM in 1981 did not indicate anyspecific concerns about the cost impacts of bridge visibility standards,either in regard to construction costs for new vessels or the operationalrules affecting loading of all vessels. In order to update this informationand relate it to the specific standards proposed, the Coast Guard specificallyinvites the public to comment concerning the costs of complying with thisproposed rule, if adopted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rulemaking, if adopted, will require the inclusion of a Bridge VisibilityPlan among those reviewed by the Coast Guard during the design processof new vessels 100 meters (328 feet) or more in length. Required submissionof various plans for review by the Coast Guard have been approved by theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) under several different control numbers.A proposal currently under review by OMB would consolidate all plan submittalrequirements in Title 46 under one control number; 2115-0505. The BridgeVisibility Plan would be one of the least complicated plans to prepare.It has been included in the consolidation proposal and in any event wouldconstitute only a minimal increase in the paperwork burden on the public.Persons wishing to comment on the information collection requirement shouldsubmit their comments to OMB as indicated under ``ADDRESSES.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism </ITAG>This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thisrulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>This proposed rulemaking has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guardand determined to be categorically excluded from further environmentaldocumentation, in accordance with section 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction(COMDTINST) M16475.1B. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statementhas been prepared and has been included in the rulemaking docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>33 CFR Part 164Marine Safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Waterways. 46 CFR Part 31Cargo vessels, Marine safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.46 CFR Part 32 Cargo vessels, Fire prevention, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Occupationalsafety and health, Seamen. 46 CFR Part 71Marine safety, Passenger vessels, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.46 CFR Part 72Fire prevention, Marine safety, Occupational safety and health, Passengervessels, Seamen. 46 CFR Part 91 Cargo vessels, Marine safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.46 CFR Part 92Cargo vessels, Fire prevention, Marine safety, Occupational safety andhealth, Seamen. 46 CFR Part 107Marine safety, Oil and gas exploration, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Vessels. 46 CFR Part 108Fire prevention, Marine safety, Occupational safety and health, Oil andgas exploration, Vessels. 46 CFR Part 189Marine safety, Oceanographic research vessels, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements. 46 CFR Part 190Fire prevention, Marine safety, Occupational safety and health, Oceanographicresearch vessels.For the reasons outlined in the preamble, the Coast Guard proposes to amendChapter I of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations and Chapter I of Title46, Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="52">TITLE 33_[AMENDED] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 164_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
