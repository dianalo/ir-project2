In the early 1970s, he wrote a book titledL'Anticapitalisme,&quot; which laid wast to Marxist thought, atthat time still devoutly embraced in France and elsewhere.But Since Mr. Fabre goes wherever his intellectual inquiriestake him, he also applied his iconoclasm to some of thetenets of neoclassical economics that still are widelyaccepted in the capitalist world.</LP><TEXT>   In particular, he set about to modify the idea that themarket price of a product always is determined by its&quot;marginal utility.&quot; Or in more simple terms, the pricesomeone is willing to pay form an additional candy bar fallsas that person satisfies his hunger for candy.   Drawing on his own favorite classical economist, DavidRicardo, Mr. Fabra argued that however true that might be, itis never possible to disregard what Ricardo called the &quot;labortheory of value.&quot; If candy bars are to exist for very long,compensation of all the people in the production chain --from the cocoa gatherers to the candy-machine builders to thesuppliers of capital to the candy company -- has to becovered by the price.   To the average person, both propositions may sound ratherobvious. But in the world of economic policy, a lot dependson how simple ideas are fitted together and where the stressis placed. Mr. Fabra demonstrated that Karl Marxintentionally misinterpreted the labor theory of valuebecause his goal was to prove that capitalism robs workers oftheir just rewards.   The neoclassicists of the late 19th-century Austrianschool, for their part, placed excessive stress on &quot;demand&quot;in their interpretations of marginal utility, and too littleon supply. Mr. Fabra's ideas were an important contributionto the revival of &quot;supply-side&quot; economics, which stresses theimportance of a public policy environment that encouragespeople to work and invest so that the goods in demand will beplentifully supplied.   &quot;L'Anticapitalisme&quot; is now available in English with thenew title &quot;Capital for Profit&quot; (Rowman andamp; Littlefield, Savage,Md.; 345 pages; $47.50). It's good reading at a time whenmarket capitalism is being introduced into once-communistparts of Europe. They will understand quite well what hewrote 16 years ago about Marxism: &quot;The socialist dream, inits extreme form, is actually the transposition, to a futureand imaginary world, of the theoretical universe built by theeconomists of the classical era for the purposes ofreasoning. But while it draws deeply on political economy,Marxism simultaneously assigns itself the aim of freeing manfrom the latter's laws. These two approaches are mutuallyexclusive and that is why the revolutionary program isbedeviled by an irremediable ambiguity.&quot;   Marxist economic theory has been empirically discreditedsince Mr. Fabra exposed its fatal contradiction. That is notyet true, however, of the distortions in public policy in theWest that have derived from the demand theories of theneoclassicists. Indeed, demand theory no doubt explains theBush administration's dubious proposition that the largeexpansion of U.S. federal spending this year will act as anantidote to recession.   In his book, Mr. Fabra offers an example of the classicaldebates about how markets set prices. It is called the &quot;waterand diamond paradox.&quot; Some 200 years ago, Smith and Ricardohad observed that water and air, while vital to every human,under ordinary circumstances have little or no market value.By contrast, gold and diamonds, which anyone can do without,have a very high market value. Hence, value must be based onsomething besides a product's usefulness. A lot of labor goesinto finding and producing gold and diamonds, whereas waterand air are obtained with little effort. Thus, the labortheory of value.   The neoclassicists countered by arguing that a man dyingof thirst in the desert with a large diamond in his pocketsurely would offer it for a glass of water. Hence, demandultimately is a more important determinant of price thanlabor cost.   The flaw there, writes Mr. Fabra, is that for there to bea market, an exchange must take place, and no man in thedesert with a single glass of water would exchange it for adiamond, lest he be the one who would die of thirst. For anexchange there would have to be an adequate supply of water,quite likely brought to the desert at some cost.   While these little syllogisms might sound trivial, in factgreat policies affecting millions of lives are based on sucheconomic debates. In Mr. Fabra's view, the Austrian school'sfocus on demand has led to government policies that haveoverstimulated wants and neglected the means to satisfy them.   Supply siders argue that mere stimulation of demand willby no means ensure supply. If the conditions for supplyingthat demand are not given equal consideration, the resultwill be inflation or shortages. One requirement is to avoidexcessive taxation of work and productive investment. Anotheris a monetary system, possibly disciplined by a goldstandard, that keeps government from overstimulating demandthrough excessive money creation.   What Mr. Fabra shows is that these ideas did not originatewith Reaganomics. If you want to find the source, go back toRicardo, arguably the first and greatest economist of themodern era.   ---   Mr. Melloan is deputy editor (international) of theJournal.</TEXT></DOC>
