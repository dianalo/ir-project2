(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Computers and robotics that slash thetime it takes to make a sailboat mast have helped a Charlottecompany become the world's largest automated maker of aluminummasts.   Isomat U.S. Inc., has reduced mast production time for theaverage 35-foot sloop-rigged sailboat by nearly 90 percent _ from75 hours to about eight _ says Mike Vaught, general manager ofIsomat's Charlotte plant.   The company is a subsidiary of International Marine Industries,Inc., which through its Sparcraft unit supplied the masts for the12-meter contenders in the last America's Cup yacht challenge,including the Stars and Stripes and Australia's Kookaburra II.   Since opening three years ago, the Charlotte plant, whichemploys about 50 people, has captured about 70 percent of the U.S.market and 85 percent of the Canadian market, company officialssaid.   Isomat U.S. manufactures 15 to 20 aluminum masts per day withits unique automated system.   ``We're set up to run 30 a day,'' said Vaught. ``Most shopscan't do that many in a month.''   Isomat U.S. had about $3 million in sales last year. Its mastsrange in price from about $600 to $4,000, depending on the size andoptions.   ``Ninety-nine percent of our business is with boat builders, whoare as price-conscious as anybody,'' Vaught said during a recenttour of the facility.   Isomat officials don't anticipate a time when all sailboat mastswill be manufactured by an automated system. Some sailboat buildersmanufacture their own masts and other ``Mom and Pop'' companieswill continue to sell enough masts to stay in business.   Another IMI subsidiary _ Kenyon Marine _ sells between 80 and100 masts a month, although its masts take five times as long tomanufacture and therefore are more expensive, Vaught said.   IMI recently moved its Kenyon operations from Connecticut toCharlotte to take advantage of some of Isomat's automated processes.   ``They (Kenyon) are after a different market,'' Vaught said.``There are people who spend $40,000 on a 40-foot sailboat, andpeople who spend $140,000.''   Isomat engineers, designs, finishes and assembles sailingsystems with extrusions produced in New York and aluminum castingsshipped in by its sister facility in France. Using its automatedsystem, the company can handle custom orders from about 40different boat builders, Vaught said.   Isomat uses computer-assisted machines to taper the masts and tocut them for attachment of the various fittings and other hardware.Sailboat masts are tapered at the top to reduce weight and minimizeair turbulence.   After tapering, the mast is coated with a special anodizing filmto prevent abrasion and corrosion in the marine environment.   ``The biggest advantage aluminum has over wood is that itdoesn't rot,'' Vaught said. ``This process adds 10 years to thelife of an aluminum mast.''   To treat the long masts, Isomat designed its own tanks. The 11tanks are 70 feet long and capable of coating masts up to 69 feetlong. Vaught said the company also can finish items such as lightand flag poles, stadium seating, and other architectural components.   The system was designed with production and flexibilty in mindbecause the market for sailboats is widely varied.   ``There's a lot of custom-ordering and we have to be able tosupply it,'' Vaught said.</TEXT></DOC>
