IBM said Monday its U.S. patent was granted for a group ofsuperconducting materials that have no resistance to electricity attemperatures when cooled to 243 degrees below zero Fahrenheit orcolder.   One of the materials remains superconducting as warm as 234degrees below zero, which IBM said is still the highest confirmedtransition temperature for any stable superconductor.   The inventors are Edward M. Engler, Victor Y. Lee, Adel I.Nazzal and Stuart S.P. Parkin, who work at IBM's Almaden ResearchCenter in San Jose, Calif. They reported their work in February1988 and the patent was issued on Sept. 26 of this year.   The plug-in chip is Intel Corp.'s i486 microprocessor, thefastest available for IBM-style personal computers. It comes on a``power platform'' that IBM said could plug into one of itspersonal computers in place of the existing microprocessor.   IBM had promised delivery of the plug-in chip by the end of theyear. It said it had installed the first one at Continental BankCorp. in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
