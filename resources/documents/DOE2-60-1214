<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-1214 </DOCNO><TEXT>The well-known Gutzwiller wave function is generalized by including newvariational parameters to control nearest-neighbour charge-charge, charge-spin,and spin-spin correlations. The non-magnetic state of one-dimensional,half-filled Hubbard model is studied. Within the Gutzwiller approximation,the expression for the ground state energy can be worked out analytically.The correlation between empty and doubly occupied sites is found to playthe most essential role. Minimization in the large-U limit shows thatthe Brinkman-Rice transition has been pushed to U -andgt; {infinity}, andthe leading term of the ground state energy density is of order -t/sup2//U. In contrast to results obtained with the Gutzwiller wave function,we find that the band occupation number n/sub k/ is monotonically decreasingboth above and below k/sub F/. The dominant k-dependence is given by{similar_to} (t/U)cos k, in agreement with t/U-expansion results. n/subk/ has also a weak step-function component, with the discontinuity atk/sub F/ vanishing as (t/U)/sup 2/ in the limit U/tandgt;andgt;1.
