When the clock ran out last week on two years of mostly partisandisputes over judicial nominations, Reagan nominees were sitting inmore than half the full-time judge's chairs in the country _ 384 of752.   One who didn't make it was Robert H. Bork. His view that thereis no explicit constitutional right of privacy helped Democratsdeny him a Supreme Court seat in a furious ideological battle.   Throughout the 100th Congress, Democrats controlling the SenateJudiciary Committee sparred often with Reagan and congressionalRepublicans.   The GOP said the committee's majority party stalled Reagan'snominees, especially near the end of the session, to keep qualifiedconservatives off the courts.   Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., called thedelays necessary, arguing that Democrats refused to rubber stampReagan nominees as he contended Republicans did when theycontrolled the panel from 1981-86.   In considering Supreme Court nominees, Biden said, the committeesent a powerful message that senators have the right to go beyondtraditional questions about a Supreme Court nominee's character.   They can inquire, he said, about whether a nominee's views are``philosophically appropriate for the times.''   Despite all the rhetoric, Reagan did reasonably well in gettinghis nominees confirmed as he fought for judges who would strictlyfollow the intent of the framers of the Constitution. The Senateapproved 91 nominees in the 100th Congress out of 110 nominations,according to Judiciary Committee statistics.   The 19 nominees not confirmed compared with 17 in thepresidential year of 1980, when Democrats controlled the Senate andthe White House, and 16 in the presidential year of 1984 whenRepublicans controlled the Senate and the White House.   Even the failure to seat Bork, in a Senate 58-42 vote in October1987, may turn into a triumph for Reagan. The justice eventuallyconfirmed for the Supreme Court seat, Anthony M. Kennedy, couldwell give the president the conservative rulings he sought fromBork.   Patrick McGuigan, a conservative and senior scholar at the FreeCongress Center for Law and Democracy, had this to say about themore conservative judiciary that Reagan will leave behind:   ``The picture you get ... is that half are principledconservatives, and the remaining range from so-so to outrightturkeys.''   McGuigan, who believes judges should ``honor the Constitutionand legislative intent, not the liberal agenda,'' said thatone-quarter of the federal judiciary is now ``strict constructionconservatives opposed in every fiber of their being to judiciallawmaking.''   McGuigan said another quarter to a third of the judiciary isgenerally conservative _ but can be swayed by ``clever lawyering.''   ``The remainder are committed judicial activists, a number ofthem very capable, highly intelligent and assertive,'' he said.   Nan Aron, co-chairwoman of the Alliance For Justice, anorganization of public interest legal groups, said the JudiciaryCommittee also left its mark by exercising ``more scrutiny'' thanwhen the panel was under GOP control.   She said the long committee debate over Bork ``set in motion amuch larger public debate over the role of the courts.''   ``In many people's minds, it established thresholds forstandards below which nominees wouldn't be confirmed. Nominees werejudged not only on their quality and integrity, but their judicialphilosophy, and what they think the role of the courts are,'' shesaid.   ``Since Reagan transformed the bench in an unprecedentedfashion, the committee will be very sensitive toward confirmingpeople with clearly defined political views or ideological views.''   A former committee aide under the Democrats, American Universitylaw professor Herman Schwartz, said Reagan's nominees already havemade their impact on the lives of Americans.   ``It's very difficult for minorities or women to win affirmativeaction cases when Reagan appointees control the court as they do inmany circuits now,'' he said.   ``In the District of Columbia circuit, a lot of environmentalcases are being thrown out on grounds of standing.''   Schwartz predicted that until the Supreme Court rules on majorabortion cases, Reagan appellate court nominees will generallyuphold ``many of the obstacles state and local governments throwup'' to make abortions more difficult.   Schwartz noted that two Reagan nominees on the District ofColumbia Circuit constituted the majority on an appellate panelthat ruled the independent counsel law violated the Constitution _the Reagan administration's position.   The Supreme Court reversed them 7-1, thus upholding the law thatallows a court-appointed counsel to investigate and prosecute topgovernment officials. Justice Kennedy did not participate.</TEXT></DOC>
