(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The body of a U.S. Air Forceofficer who was shot down over Libya in 1986 was returned Monday tothe United States and honored with a brief ceremony.   Maj. Fernando Ribas-Dominicci was killed in the 1986 U.S. airraid on Tripoli. He was 33 and a captain, and was promotedposthumously to major.   The C-141 Starlifter from Torrejon Air Base in Spain was met atDover Air Force Base by Ribas-Dominicci's family and an Air Forcehonor guard, pallbearers and color guard.   The family was proud of what ``Paul and Fernando and the rest ofthe guys were doing in the defense of democracy, freedom and thegood things that our country stands for,'' said his brother,Salvador Ribas-Dominicci, 37, of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico.   He was referring to Capt. Paul Lorence of San Francisco, who wasin the F-111 bomber with Ribas-Dominicci when it was shot down.   Libya had said the body it released and flew to Rome on Fridaybelonged to Lorence. An autopsy, however, showed it wasRibas-Dominicci.   Salvador Ribas-Dominicci said he was angry because the bodyshould have been identified and returned immediately. ``Militarypeople are supposed to live by codes of honor ... and obviously(Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi was trying to play something withthis,'' he said.   Also attending the ceremony were the major's wife, Blanca BerainRibas-Dominicci, 36, and his 7-year-old son, Fernando Jr., both ofAustin, Texas; another brother, Jose Alfredo Ribas-Dominicci, 52, ofSan Juan, Puerto Rico; a nephew, Miguel Carlos Ribas-Dominicci, 23,and a niece, Nivea Rosario Ribas-Dominicci, 28, both of New York.
