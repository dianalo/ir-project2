 Iraq is much like a rebellious adolescent wresting center stagefrom his parents.andP;  Unless the major powers lose their cool or their nerve,the international balance of power probably will not shift significantly.andM;One of the real battlegrounds for world supremacy is the arena ofinternational standards.andP;  This slow and quiet process could tip theinternational balance in an ominous direction.andM;A recent Commerce Department study casually cites international standards asan opportunity for promoting U.S.andP;  technological leadership.andP;  Title EmergingTechnologies: A Survey of Technical and Economic Opportunities, it is arguesthat unless we act promply, our leadership will erode and pass to theJapanese and, to a lesser extent, the Europeans.andM;Unfortunately, this paper does not examine the process of developing andadopting international standards.andP;  If it had, it probably would haverecommended that the United States act decisively across a wide front or loseout to our economic rivals.andM;The trading bloc that effectively influences the definition of internationalstandards can give its constituent companies a potential advantage.andP;  Cleverlycrafted standards can force foreign competitors to redesign their productsand services.andP;  Temporarily shielded, local industry can establish marketshare into a strong defense, effective against an even less costly orsuperior product.andM;Standards define the marketplace.andP;  They provide written descriptions ofproducts and services, thereby putting buyers and sellers on equal footing.andO;The adoption of international standards has the potential to reduceprotectionism and promote freer exchanges of goods.andM;For complex information technologies, claiming to meet the internationalstandard is not enough.andP;  Certification procedures and testing laboratoriescan lessen the risk that the product will disappoint the purchaser.andO;Certified conformace to international standards can give the overseas buyerthe assurance of a specified set of functions and characteristics.andM;In the absence of international standards, national standards can be used toprotect markets from worthy foreign products, simply because they aredifferent from the typical domestic sollution.andP;  The foreign products are notnecessarily any less effective just because they are different.andP;  Theirexclusion may be attributable to little or no representation on aninternational standard committee.andM;Multinational companies are a major force for harmonization of standards.andO;Uniform global markets can allow multinationals to take full advantage of anyeconomies of scale for production and distribution.andP;  Therefore, thesecompanies tend to be strong advocates for international standards.andP;  But ifthe multinationals are constrained by local standards, they can move theiroperations elsewhere.andM;Effective ParticipationandM;U.S.andP;  participation in international standards development must be fruitfulto be effective.andP;  Delaying tactics may prevent timely internationalstandards, only to encourage the emergence of national, regional or de factostandards, a process virtually beyond our influence.andP;  In the absence ofinternational standards, a country can blatantly exclude solutionscharacteristic of U.S.andP;  companies.andP;  We might then have few options short ofinternational trade protests or retaliation against imports from thatcountry.andM;For example, in a paper presented to the recent 6th International Conferenceon the Application of Standards for Open Systems, Kevin Mills of the CommerceDepartment questioned the exclusion of a popular U.S.andP;  telecommunicationsprotocol by the British government.andP;  &quot;Does England really need to restrictthe connectionless network protocol from use on X.25 networks?&quot; he wrote.andM;U.S.andP;  networks support both connectionless protocols, such as the TCP/INPwidely used in the Defense Department, and the connection-oriented protocols,preferred in Britain and by a few U.S.andP;  vendors.andP;  Like mosttelecommunications experts, Mills argues that there is no sound technicalreason why both protocols could not be used on the other side of theAtlantic.andM;Mills pointed out that standards development can be a tedious and costlyexercise.andP;  However, the expectations of greater opportunities for world tradespurs governments, vendors and users to make the investment.andM;Simply relying on national standards will isolate the United States.andP;  Underinternational trade rules, other countries could retaliate, barring eventhose U.S.andP;  exports that met international standards.andP;  More importantly, ourimplementations would meet our standards but not those of the rest of theworld.andP;  Such products would be unable to compete overseas in markets thathave become larger than our own.andM;If the United States wants to hold onto a leadership role in new informationtechnologies, it must commit talented people and other scarce resources tothe development of international standards, protocols and implementationprofiles.andP;  Otherwise, this country will be playing catch-up in someone else'sgame.andM;Walter R. Houser is responsible for information resources management andpolicy at a major federal agency.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
