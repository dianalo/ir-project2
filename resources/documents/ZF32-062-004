Our review criteria filtered out three productsworth considering: Cross+Connect from Cross Communications,MultiCom-AsyncGateway from Multi-Tech, and Telebit ACS from Telebit Corp.andO;These products provide both remote-access and modem-sharing services.andP;  Butinstead of giving you remote control over network resources, they let youaccess the network via modem and then redirect you to another networkworkstation you can control remotely.andM;Cross+Connect lets you dial into one of several nondedicated access serversand then decide which PC on the network  you  would like to remotely control.andO;MultiComAsyncGateway, after it allows you to dial into a single dedicatedaccess serv-er, then redirects you to your own networked PC.andP;  Telebit ACSalso presents incoming callers with a list of workstations available foraccess, provided the user has the correct ID and password.andM;Cross+Connect is a  combination of Cross Communications' LAN+Modem andIn+Touch products.andP;  The all-software product requires little memory and workson both NetWare and NetBIOS LANs.andP;  At $995 for the five-modem version,Cross+Connect provides a low-cost entry to the remote-access market andgrants the added benefit of modem sharing.andM;Since Cross+Connect does not require a dedicated computer as the asynchronousgateway or access server, it can support standard serial ports on multiplecomputers.andP;  This lets you use the computer as a normal network workstationwhile it answers calls, but poses a potential problem.andP;  Any time you share acomputer and make it do multiple tasks in the DOS environment, you cannotdepend on the computer staying alive.andM;The computers with modems attached handle both incoming and outgoing callswithout conflicts.andP;  When modems are in use, Cross+Connect marks them as busyand unavailable to other users on the network.andP;  A small 7K TSR runs oncomputers with attached modems and displays a menu of the computers on thenetwork available to be taken over.andP;  Once you attach to a remote computer,you can run programs just as if you were typing on that computer's keyboard.andO;Cross+Connect works only in text mode and does not handle any graphics.andM;Cross+Connect's asynchronous gateway supports communications software withINT14 implemented.andP;  This lets users share the modems distributed throughoutthe network, saving money and wiring costs.andP;  The modem-sharing facilitiesalso include background mail-transfer capabilities.andP;  Cross+Connect alsoincludes a basic terminal-emulation program.andP;  The Cross+Connect system willhandle speeds only up to 19,200 bits per second, however.andP;  If your networkuses high-speed modems, that could limit the transmission rate to half thethroughput of most other products that we reviewed.andM;Cross+Connect works well and offers a good solution for small companieswanting a low-cost answer to their dial-in and dial-out needs.andP;  It is notdesigned for critical applications or heavy-duty use.andM;MultiComAsyncGateway comes in a variety of configurations designed to fit anycompany's needs.andP;  It provides both incoming and outgoing modem services andworks over NetBIOS networks.andM;Multi-Tech offers several different combinations of products to solve yourproblems.andP;  The $995  four-port system includes the software and hardwarenecessary to handle four 9,600-bps connections, using pcAnywhere IV forremote access.andP;  The more advanced eight-port solution, costing $2,495, isexpandable to 16 ports and can handle a 38,400-bps connection in each port,but it does not include the remote-access software.andP;  Other combinations areavailable as well.andM;Installation is not difficult, but you have to spend some time defining usersand network addresses.andP;  MultiCom-AsyncGateway requires at least a 286-basedcomputer as the access/gateway server, while Cross+Connect lets you use anXT.andM;Multi-Tech's gateway software controls and manages communications across thenetwork, while its connection manager handles incoming calls from the modem.andO;To set up their computers to be taken over, users on the network establish aconnection to the gateway from their PCs and run AWHOST before leaving thepremises.andP;  When they call in from the remote location with ATERM, the gatewaysoftware answers and asks for their user ID and password.andP;  Once it validatesthe answers, the gateway connects them to their own networked computers.andM;MultiComAsyncGateway handles calls well, but requires users to know beforethey leave the office for the night that they will want to get back into thenetwork later.andP;  Although it's primarily designed for someone who has acomputer at the office and wants to access it remotely, the added benefit ofmodem sharing makes it a nice option for thrifty companies.andM;Like the other two products, the Tele-bit ACS operates as an asynchronousgateway and doubles as a remote-access computer.andP;  The Telebit ACS works overboth NetWare and NetBIOS networks.andP;  The $3,995 product includes an eight-portserial card, Digital Communications Associates' Crosstalk Mk.4 communicationssoftware with a license for  eight  simultaneous  users,  and pcAnywhere/IVLAN with a license for an unlimited number of simultaneous users on thenetwork.andP;  Telebit ACS, which can reside in a 286-based PC, handles calls wellwith its intelligent multiport serial card.andM;The Telebit ACS allows you to expand your system as your needs grow.andP;  Theeight-port solution can grow into a 32-port gateway by simply adding threemore eight-port cards.andP;  Each port can handle connection speeds of up to38,400 bps.andM;Installation is quick and easy.andP;  You install the software in a publicdirectory on the LAN and run the gateway as the boot process.andP;  Telebit'sgateway software handles calls coming in from the modem by presenting a listof workstations available for use.andP;  If users want to access their systemswhile away, they simply set up the machines to be taken over before theyleave the office.andP;  The users can later call in from remote locations withATERM.andP;  After they select their networked PC from the list, pcAnywhere IV/LANasks for a user ID and password.andP;  Once validated by the system, users thenhave control of their own PC on the network and access to the LAN as if theywere sitting at their own desks.andM;The Telebit ACS is costly, but it does provide a high-quality dial-in anddial-out solution with plenty of room for expansion.andM;Cross+Connect, Version 1.2andM;Cross Communications Co., Canyon Center, 1881 9th St., #302, Boulder, CO80302-5151;
