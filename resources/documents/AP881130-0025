KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. George Mitchell, the new Senate majorityleader, first reached a national audience when he bucked a tide ofsympathy for Oliver L. North and said the Marine lieutenant colonelhad no monopoly on patriotism.   North had stolen the televised spotlight at the 1987 Iran-Contrahearings as he repeatedly attacked those in Congress who hadvigorously opposed the Reagan administration's policy of militaryaid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.   He appealed for congressional aid to the Contras ``for the loveof God and the love of country.''   Mitchell, a former federal prosecutor and district court judge,counterattacked _ but in a characteristic calm manner.   ``Please remember that others share that devotion and recognizethat it is possible for an American to disagree with you on aid tothe Contras and still love God and still love this country just asmuch as you do,'' Mitchell told North.   ``In America, disagreement with the policies of the government isnot evidence of lack of patriotism,'' he declared.   For Mitchell, that moment under the crystal chandeliers of theSenate Caucus Room represented his debut on the national scene.   But he already was being lionized by Senate Democrats.   As chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, Mitchellengineered the stunning 1986 upset that saw Democrats regain theSenate control they had lost in Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidentiallandslide.   His reward: instant influence and clout on the Democratic side ofthe aisle and appointment as the Senate's deputy president protempore, a largely honorary post but an important mark of the highregard of Democratic senators.   Now, the Senate's majority Democrats have passed to Mitchell thegavel of leadership being relinquished by Senate Majority LeaderRobert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who is stepping down to become chairman ofthe Senate Appropriations Committee.   Twenty seven Democrats voted for Mitchell on the first ballot inthe party's caucus Tuesday. Twenty eight others split evenly betweenSens. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, and J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.Mitchell was then elected by acclamation.   Mitchell's elevation to the Senate's top leadership post giveshim control of the chamber's agenda as the 101st Congress begins itswork and as President-elect George Bush launches his administrationand announces his policy and legislative goals.   It marks a new beginning after Byrd's long tenure as partyleader. Many Senate Democrats hope Mitchell can use it to project apositive, forward-looking image for their party in the wake of itsthree successive defeats in for the presidency. He has vowed toshare his authority with colleagues, saying, ``I do not intend to bea one-man band.''   Mitchell, 55, has been active in Maine's Democratic politicssince 1968, and is a protege of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, whomhe served as administrative assistant in the early 1960s.   Mitchell suffered a number of political setbacks, includingdefeat in a bid for governor in 1974. But with Muskie's backing, hewas appointed first as U.S. attorney for Maine, then as a federaldistrict judge.   When Muskie resigned from the Senate in May 1980 to becomesecretary of state under former President Carter, he recommendedMaine's Democratic governor appoint Mitchell to fill the vacancy.   Two years later, Mitchell won the seat in his own right by acommanding 61 percent of the vote. He won a second term this year byan even more impressive 81 percent.   In the Senate, Mitchell compiled a largely liberal voting recordand became a leading critic of the Reagan administration'senvironmental record.   At the Iran-Contra hearings, he compared North's glitteringMarine Corps record in Vietnam and the patriotism of the immigrantson whom he had conferred citizenship as a judge.   ``My mother was an immigrant, my father the orphaned son ofimmigrants,'' he said. ``Their opportunities were very limitedbecause neither of them had any education. ... They worked at verymenial tasks in our society.''   And he told North that when he asked new immigrants why theywished to live in the United States, many of them said the reasonwas that ``in America you can criticize the government withoutlooking over your shoulder.''   Mitchell's father was a utility company laborer who later workedas a janitor. His mother, an immigrant from Lebanon, worked at awoolen mill in Waterville, Maine, where the family lived.   Their son graduated from Maine's Bowdoin College in 1954 and fromGeorgetown University law school in 1960.</TEXT></DOC>
