Pismo Clam [ID 518450]andM;TO: One And AllandM;SB: The Clown (AKA My Boss) Strikes again !andP;  Bozo just left in a huff.andO;Accidentally copied a new file over an old one.andP;  Was amazed that NortonUtilities won't retrieve the original.andP;  Ordered me to remove Norton from ourlist of approved programs.andP;  And yet around here they treat Bozo like a hero!andO;Why do I take this abuse?andM;It's The Guy Who Can't Shut Up! No public online forum is complete withoutthis egomaniac, the self-styled genius who slags his company, his staff, andhis boss in front of the world.andP;  TGWCSU assumes his targets are toocomputer-ignorant to catch him in the act.andP;  They may be.andP;  So far, I haven'tseen reported cases of lost jobs or marriages from such online shenanigans.andO;But sooner or later, modem-wise underlings will learn to claw their way tothe top by printing out these bash-the-boss threads and discreetly depositingthem on the right desk.andM;Still, TGWCSU understands that his public complaints are just that-public.andO;Not so the trusting souls who believe their &quot;private&quot; missives about theboss's misdeeds will be forever secure under cover of e-mail, who labor underthe delusion that there is such a thing as total electronic privacy.andM;In faxworld, where envelopes are non-existent, embarrassed senders have begunto realize that there's no telling whose snooping eyes will read atransmission at its destination.andP;  E-mail beats that, but not necessarily bymuch.andM;The envelope for e-mail is essentially your password.andP;  Without it-or so thetheory goes-no one can read your mail.andP;  So the simplest place to swipe e-mailis the machine left unlocked and accessible during lunch hour.andP;  Or themachine whose password is virtually public knowledge.andP;  People write downtheir passwords or store them in files with baffling names like PSSWRDS.HID.andO;They loan out passwords in crises and forget to change them.andP;  One day theymay wonder how in the world a private memo they never wrote could go out tothe boss in their name-calling him all sorts of things they fervently believebut would never dare mention.andM;But not even a secure password can guarantee security.andP;  True, some internale-mail systems actually encrypt the mail so that only the proper passwordwill restore its legibility.andP;  Some systems even store passwords in encryptedform so that they're safe from snoops.andM;Yet all that cloak-and-dagger activity won't keep your mail secure from asystem administrator who really wants to read it or a boss who demands a peekover his or her shoulder.andP;  System administrators are as gods.andP;  If they don'thappen to know your password, they can simply change it.andP;  After that, yourmailbox is only a few simple keystrokes away.andM;With public e-mail, encryption is virtually unknown.andP;  Services like MCI Mailand CompuServe generally store messages as plaintext, potentially accessibleto any renegade employee with system smarts.andM;The reason is the service's publicness, its ability to let anyone gain accesswith virtually any kind of terminal.andP;  Requiring terminals to do decryptingwould bar non-standard, dumb, and under-powered devices from the system.andO;Demand computing power for offline decryption, and you'd hear howls fromhundreds of users with ancient laptop machines and gutless terminals.andP;  Theonly way to ensure that some unauthorized hireling of your e-mail servicewon't swipe your long-shot horse tips is to encrypt them yourself beforemailing-a royal pain.andP;  Electronic eavesdropping may seem hypothetical, if notdownright paranoid.andP;  After all, we say all kinds of things over the phonesevery day, and we don't worry-at least not much-about who might be listeningin.andM;Poor-analogy.andP;  Phone conversations are real-time, ephemeral unless recorded,and difficult to search.andP;  Electronic mail stores all messages electronicallyin one convenient place, making it relatively trivial to write software thathunts for and retrieves corporate secrets, comments about Mr. Big, gripes,whatever.andP;  And not just yours-everybody's !andP;  Think nobody would be interestedin compromising an e-mail system? Think again.andP;  About a year ago, anenterprising individual publicly posted software to crack the LAN-basedcc:Mail program's encryption scheme.andP;  Sorely provoked, the company builtstronger encryption facilities four ways.andM;A former e-mail administrator at Epson America recently accused the companyof spying on its employees' e-mail.andP;  Epson officials deny the charge, but nowroutinely warn employees that for &quot;maintenance&quot; reasons Epson can't guaranteethe confidentiality of electronic communications even though it doesn't&quot;indiscriminately&quot; read them.andP;  An Epson spokesperson refused to state whetherthe company might &quot;discriminately&quot; read the mail of, say, suspectedmiscreants.andM;After all, some overbearing corporations now routinely listen in on theiremployees' telephone chats.andP;  More and more of them will surely take thewrongheaded position that e-mail isn't private either.andP;  Consider this awarning.andP;  For all that, the purloined electronic letter remains the (rare)exception.andP;  So far, the guardians of the electronic kingdom seem no lesstrustworthy than the postal employees who honor the seals on our papercorrespondence.andP;  So far.andM;Then there's voice mail.andP;  Guess how private that is.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
