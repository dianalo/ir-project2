(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A police bomb squad today disarmed a parcelbomb found at the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the NAACP, thelatest discovery in a rash of mail bombings in the South that haveclaimed two lives, authorities said.   ``It was designed to kill the individual that opened thispackage or anyone else standing in the area,'' said JacksonvilleSheriff Jim McMillan.   The building was evacuated and the bomb, which arrived in themail Monday but was left unopened, was disarmed by disconnectingthe battery from the explosive, officials said.   ``It had a great similarity in the packaging to the otherbombs,'' said Willi Ellison of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms. ``It was addressed to no one specifically, but to thelegal staff of the NAACP.''   The bomb was to be taken to an FBI laboratory in Washington andcompared with the other devices, he said.   FBI Director William Sessions said in Washington thatinvestigators were looking into race as a possible motive, notingthat the incidents involved ``federal judges who have heard casesinvolving racial matters,'' the NAACP and a black civil rightsactivist.   Under questioning, Sessions told a Justice Department newsconference that more than one person might be involved in thebombings, which have killed a federal judge and a civil rightslawyer.   The parcel bomb that killed the lawyer in Savannah had beenpacked with nails, suggesting another link to the bomb that killedthe judge and another bomb, authorities said.   In Alabama, police X-rayed a package left on the doorstep of aBirmingham city councilman who was friends with the slain judge,but concluded it was probably an innocent mailing. ``This is one ofmany screening processes we'll probably be going through because ofthe situation,'' said FBI agent Allen Whitaker.   The FBI, meanwhile, warned judges, lawyers and NAACP activiststo beware of strange packages, saying white supremacists might bebehind the attacks.   Robert Robinson, a 42-year-old black lawyer and city alderman,was fatally injured in his law office Monday night, hours afterpolice removed an explosive device delivered to the 11th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and two days after a mail bombkilled 11th Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance.   ``There's a strong similarity in the three explosive devices,and it appears there is a relationship,'' FBI agent Tom Moore saidin Birmingham, Ala.   Officials said the bomb that killed Vance on Saturday hurlednails when it exploded. The Atlanta Constitution today quotedunidentified authorities as saying the Atlanta bomb contained nailsas well, and Savannah Mayor John Rousakis said today: ``We believednails were part of this bomb also, and that has been confirmed.''   Robinson represented the NAACP in a long-running desegregationlawsuit involving Savannah schools, and the 11th Circuit, whichhandles appeals for Georgia, Alabama and Florida, had recentlyruled in that case.   Federal marshals said the nine judges in the 11th Circuit werebeing given round-the-clock protection.   In Washington, a government source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said the bomb that killed Vance bore the return addressof a second judge who regularly sent Vance packages. The secondjudge, Lewis F. Morgan, also of the 11th Circuit, is not a suspectin the case. But the discovery means the killer knew a great dealabout Vance's personal habits and friendships, the source added.   FBI agent Bob DeLoach said Monday that authorities werefollowing several leads but that it was possible white supremacistssent the bomb that killed Robinson.   ``I've been here three years and can't recall whitesupremacists, but who knows what goes on in people's minds and whythey'd start now?'' DeLoach asked. ``We're definitely looking intothat, but everything else, too.''   Former Alabama Ku Klux Klan leader Don Black, who now lives inSouth Florida, said there are disgruntled members of the whitesupremacist movement who believe the legal system works against thewhite majority.   ``They believe the only solution is direct attacks, illegalacts, on the system,'' Black said. ``When that first bombinghappened Saturday, it occurred to me it might not be Colombian drugsmugglers.''   DeLoach and FBI agent William Henshaw said the FBI was warninglawyers, judges and activists with the National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People to look over their mail carefully.   Henshaw said the NAACP Southeast regional headquarters inAtlanta also had been warned because the bombs appeared to berelated to a Aug. 22, 1989 tear-gas mail bomb that exploded at theAtlanta office, injuring eight people. That case is still beinginvestigated.   Earl Shinhoster, the NAACP regional director, said he had talkedwith the FBI and ``needless to say, it was a wide-rangingdiscussion.''   Shinhoster also said he hadn't ruled out the possibility thatwhite supremacists were responsible for the bombings ``especiallynow, since various groups ... are much more zealous in theirparticular ideological pursuits.''   Morris Dees, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said theFBI had warned him to take precautions.   ``The FBI contacted me as a routine matter (because) theysuspect it was a possibility that white supremacists were involvedin the bombings,'' he said. ``And, as a precautionary measurebecause of my past involvement, wanted to warn me.''   On Sunday, authorities warned the nation's 1,500 federal judgesto be careful with their mail.   ``We have pretty good security here,'' said U.S. Circuit JudgeWilliam W. Wilkins of Greenville, S.C. ``But I've of course askedmy family not to open any packages mailed to the home unless I'vehad a chance to take a look at them.''   ``It's a tough business,'' said Judge Daniel A. Manion of SouthBend, Ind. Manion sits on a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.   Robinson represented the NAACP in its challenge to a plan tosettle a 25-year-old desegregation lawsuit against the SavannahSchool system, said State Rep. Jim Pannell of Savannah, whoattended the University of Georgia Law school with Robinson.   The 11th Circuit in September upheld the plan that reliedheavily on magnet schools to draw more whites into predominantlyblack schools and voluntary ``majority to minority'' transfers.   The NAACP and U.S. Department of Justice had objected to theplan, which was put into place voluntarily by the school systemlast fall.   Vance, 58, was not on the three-judge panel that ruled in thecase but did serve on a panel that had cleared the way forprosecution of a case against the Ku Klux Klan.   The panel, in a June 1985 decision, had overturned a lower courtruling that had thrown out evidence critical to the prosecution of10 Klansmen in a bloody May 1979 confrontation with black civilrights marchers in Decatur, Ala., that wounded four people.   Authorities said the Atlanta bomb was in a mailed packageaddressed to the 11th Circuit courthouse _ but not to a specificindividual, unlike the bomb that killed Vance. Employees wereevacuated from the five-story downtown building Monday morning.Police safely disarmed the bomb.</TEXT></DOC>
