Mitchell saysit's no more Mr. Nice Guy. Senators will have to start putting theirelected noses to the grindstone.   Frustrated after a week in which no action was completed on thefour bills on his menu, Mitchell threatened Friday to crack the whip.   In keeping with the Senate's leaning toward abundant etiquette,Mitchell's warning came after consulting his Republican andDemocratic colleagues.   Mitchell said he's thinking about putting a stop to four-dayweekends and shortening the four-week August recess so senators cantend to legislative basics like the budget and defense and farmlegislation.   The $98,000-a-year senators may also face the prospect of votingin the morning and burning the midnight oil more than one night aweek, Mitchell said. Thursday is the only regular day for late-nightsessions.   He didn't mention having the sergeant-at-arms make midnightarrests and physically carry reluctant lawmakers to the Senatefloor. Democrats under former Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of WestVirginia resorted to that tactic in February 1988.   ``We're just reaching the point where it is very, very difficultto move forward on any piece of legislation,'' Mitchell said, addinghe was particularly perturbed at a higher-than-usual absentee rate.   Senators had been asking him to put off important votes whilethey went to graduations, to Czechoslovakia to monitor elections, ormake their regular weekend visits to home states to meet withvoters, raise money or electioneer.   ``Obviously that circumstance cannot continue,'' Mitchell said.``We all have an obligation to conduct the public business.''   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who once had Mitchell's job,said forcing a senator to the floor is like leading a horse to water.   ``It doesn't mean we're going to do anything in that time,'' Dolesaid, explaining that Republicans don't share Mitchell's sense ofurgency about some of the legislation.   But at least one Republican, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., saidshe was disappointed so few senators were around to vote on anamendment she was seeking to protect the general aviation industry.   Dole also joked that the public might like having their lawmakersas far away from Washington as possible.   ``We can't do anything to them while we're home,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
