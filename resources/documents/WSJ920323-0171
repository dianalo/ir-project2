The combination thus has anindicated value of $16.8 million, making it one of thefattest pay envelopes ever for a Wall Street brokerageexecutive.   Merrill President Daniel Tully wasn't far behind. His paypackage included $4.9 million in cash, plus stock optionswith an indicated value of $9.4 million, according to thecompany's proxy statement. And 11 other executive officers atMerrill, the nation's biggest brokerage company, receivedcompensation -- including the indicated value of stockoptions -- averaging $5.2 million apiece.</LP><TEXT>   The Merrill pay packages are the biggest yet in what isshaping up as a banner year for Wall Street executive pay.Wall Street slashed paychecks -- and thousands of jobs -- inthe years after the 1987 stock-market crash. Now thebrokerage industry's soaring pay is reflecting the recordprofits made last year amid a boom in stock and bondissuance.   In its proxy statement, Merrill said Mr. Schreyer receivedoptions for 300,000 Merrill shares that can be exercised inequal installments over four years. Those options, which weregranted in January 1991, already have soared in value amidWall Street's rebound. If all of the options were able to becashed in at Merrill's current stock price of $58 a share,they would have an indicated value of nearly $11 million.   The bulging pay reflects Merrill's 1991 record profit ofnearly $700 million. But Merrill officials argue that optionsshouldn't be included in the pay totals. It is &quot;overlysimplistic&quot; to include options in Merrill's pay packagesbecause options can't be cashed in immediately and couldchange drastically in value, said Herbert M. Allison Jr., aMerrill executive vice president.   The hefty 1991 paychecks could prove sensitive at a timewhen the economy is still shaky -- and while the thousands oflayoffs taken by Merrill and other Wall Street companies inrecent years are still fresh in employees' minds.   Even some brokerage executives -- at least those outsideof New York -- question whether anyone is worth so much.Though it's difficult to run a major brokerage company, &quot;whenyou get into these really high numbers, you say: `Can one guybe worth that?'&quot; said David W. Hunter, chairman emeritus ofParker/Hunter Inc., a Pittsburgh brokerage concern. &quot;One ofthe problems with a lot of us in Middle America is that it'shard to imagine people being worth what they're gettingpaid.&quot;   Other Wall Street chairmen to get large raises last yearinclude Alan &quot;Ace&quot; Greenberg of Bear Stearns Cos., who got a26% increase to $5.3 million; Howard Clark Jr. of AmericanExpress Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., whose paydoubled to $2.8 million; and Frank Zarb of Primerica Corp.'sSmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., whose pay rose 44% to $2.3million. All these companies posted sizable profit gains,though their net income didn't approach that at Merrill.   The blunt-spoken Mr. Greenberg makes no apologies for hispaycheck. He notes that he and other senior Bear Stearnsexecutives get only $200,000 apiece as a base salary; therest of the pay is tied directly to how well the firm, andits shareholders, make out.   &quot;I don't know if Michael Jackson is worth what he gets,and I don't know if a {baseball player} who hits .250 isworth $2.5 million, which is what he gets,&quot; Mr. Greenbergsaid. &quot;I'm not a philosopher.&quot;   Based on Bear Stearns' performance so far for its fiscal1992 year ending June 30, Mr. Greenberg's 1992 cash pay couldsoar to nearly $10 million, people familiar with the companysaid. Bear Stearns declined to comment, except to note thatits compensation formulas have been approved by shareholders.   At Merrill, Messrs. Schreyer and Tully declined tocomment. But Merrill officials emphasized that the companyhas consistently &quot;paid for performance&quot; and hasn't changedits basic approach to compensating chief exexutives, which istied to Merrill's profitability. &quot;When profits are down, sois CEO pay, and vice versa,&quot; said Merrill's Mr. Allison.   When Mr. Schreyer and other Merrill officials were grantedtheir stock options in early 1991, Merrill's share price wasmired in the low-20s; the options carried an exercise priceallowing the officials to buy Merrill stock for $21.375 ashare. Since then, Merrill's stock has nearly tripled inprice as brokerage shares have rallied.   If Mr. Schreyer were to receive the nearly $11 million forall his options -- calculated by subtracting the options'exercise price of $21.375 a share from Merrill's current $58stock price -- Mr. Allison said &quot;shareholders would have anaggregate increase in value of more than $3.7 billion.&quot;   The options are &quot;not money that has actually been paid,&quot;he said. &quot;It is an opportunity that is granted and whosevalue is dependent on performance over time.&quot; Though theoptions ultimately could be worth more or less than thecurrent value, he added, &quot;the whole purpose of them is toprovide a long-term motivation for increasing shareholderwealth.&quot;   Given the run-up in Merrill stock last year, Mr. Schreyerwould receive nearly $11 million for all his options ifMerrill's stock price remains at its current level for thenext four years.   In addition to Messrs. Schreyer and Tully, several othersenior Merrill officials received hefty paychecks. Merrillexecutive vice presidents Barry Friedberg, Roger Vasey andJohn Steffens received 1991 cash compensation of $4.2million, $4 million and $3.9 million, respectively, beforethe stock options for 80,000 shares that each received.   &quot;We're in an industry that is highly competitive inattracting productive talent,&quot; a Merrill spokesman said.   Big raises are also expected at Morgan Stanley Group Inc.,PaineWebber Group Inc. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.'s Dean WitterReynolds Inc., none of which has yet disclosed pay.   At Smith Barney, Chairman Frank Zarb's cash pay outpacedthat of his boss, Primerica Chairman Sanford Weill.Primerica's proxy statement shows how profitable stockoptions can be for Wall Street chief executives. In the pastthree years, Mr. Weill exercised options for nearly 850,000Primerica shares -- gaining $13.7 million in stock -- and Mr.Zarb exercised about 73,000 options, gaining $860,159 instock, the proxy statement says.   Next month, Primerica's shareholders will be asked to voteon an amended option plan that will grant Mr. Zarb optionsfor an additional 59,412 Primerica shares at an exerciseprice of $35.375 a share, and Mr. Weill options for 625,041shares at an exercise price of $35.625. Primerica sharesclosed Friday at $39.375 in New York Stock Exchange trading.Messrs. Zarb and Weill declined to comment.   At Shearson, the pay of Mr. Clark exceeded that of hisboss, American Express Chairman James Robinson. In additionto his 1991 cash pay, Mr. Robinson was granted options for150,000 American Express shares and Mr. Clark options for55,000 shares, both at an exercise price of $25.50 a share.But those options are currently under water because AmericanExpress shares are trading below the exercise price. OnFriday, American Express shares traded at $22.25 in Big Boardtrading. Messrs. Clark and Robinson declined to comment.   Meanwhile, some brokerage executives appear to be buckingthe trend toward sky-high paychecks. Take Thomas A. James,chairman of St. Petersburg, Fla., brokerage company RaymondJames Financial Inc. and chairman of the Securities IndustryAssociation.   After receiving a 34% increase to nearly $775,000 for thefirm's 1991 fiscal year ended Sept. 27, Mr. James said, &quot;myboard wanted to pay me more.&quot; But he said with a chuckle: &quot;Itold them I was more than well-compensated.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
