A new high-spin level scheme, comprising three differentrotational bands is presented. The negative-parity {Delta}I=1 ground-stateband is the most complete example of the semidecoupled {pi}h/sub 9/2/x{nu}i/sub13/2/ structure, in a prolate deformed situation, known to date. Theother two bands are the doubly decoupled {pi}h/sub 9/2/x{nu}1/2/sup -/[521] and a {Delta}I=1, {pi}5/2/sup +/ [402]x{nu}i/sub 13/2/ based structureof the compressed type.</TEXT></DOC>
