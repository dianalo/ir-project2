A final regulatory impact analysis is availablefrom the above named individual.It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto this final rule since the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is notrequired by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of the law to publish anotice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of thisrule.An Environmental Evaluation with respect to the Disaster Payment Programhas been completed. It has been determined that this action is not expectedto have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Inaddition, it has been determined that this action will not adversely affectenvironmental factors such as wildlife habitat, water quality, air quality,and land use and appearance. Accordingly, neither an Environmental Assessmentnor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.The titles and numbers of the federal assistance program to which thisrule applies are: Title_Cotton_10.052; Feed Grain_10.055; Wheat_10.058;Rice_10.065; as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and localofficials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, publishedat 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The 1989 Act provides that disaster payments for prevented planting andlow yield losses will be made available to producers of 1989 crops of wheat,feed grains, upland and extra long staple cotton, and rice (target pricecommodities); peanuts; sugar; tobacco; soybeans; sunflowers; and nonprogramcrops. With respect to producers of target price commodities who are enrolledin the 1989 acreage reduction programs, in order to be eligible to receivesuch a payment, the loss of production of the crop must be greater than40 percent of the farm's expected production determined on the basis ofyields established as prescribed in the 1989 Act. However, if a produceron the farm had crop insurance on the disaster affected crop under theFederal Crop Insurance Act, the crop loss requirement for that produceris 35 percent. With respect to producers of target price commodities whichare not enrolled in the 1989 acreage reduction programs, the loss requirementis 50 percent. Producers of peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane, and tobaccomust have incurred a production loss of 40 percent on the farm, or 35 percentif a producer had crop insurance on the commodity for which disaster benefitsare requested. Producers of soybeans and sunflowers must have incurreda 45 percent loss and producers of nonprogram crops must have incurreda loss of 50 percent in order to be eligible to receive such payment.The 1989 Act also provides that any person who has qualifying gross revenuesin excess of $2,000,000 annually shall not be eligible to receive any disasterpayment. The 1989 Act provides that qualifying gross revenue means, ifa majority of the person's annual income is received from farming, ranching,and forestry operations, the gross revenue from such operations. With respectto persons who receive less than a majority of their annual income fromsuch operations, the gross revenue from all sources will be considered.For purposes of determining a ``person'', 7 CFR part 1477 provides thatthe provisions of 7 CFR part 1497 shall be used. The provisions of andSection;1497.8 refer only to farming operations. However, this gross revenue determinationrequires the review of an entity's non-farm income. Accordingly, for purposesof determining whether two or more entities shall be considered to be one``person'', the income from all entities, whether or not an individualentity is engaged in farming, shall be used.The 1989 Act also provides with respect to any loss of production on afarm which is in an amount equal to 40 percent, or 35 percent for producerswith crop insurance, or less that such producers on the farm who received1989 crop advance deficiency payments will not be required to refund thatportion of such advance which would otherwise be required to be refundedif market prices increase to a level which would require repayment in accordancewith section 107C of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (the 1949Act). The amount of production which shall be subject to forgiveness shallbe the lesser of the amount of disaster loss or 35 to 40 percent, as applicable,of expected production. The 1989 Act also provides that producers who did not request advance deficiencypayment with respect to crops for which such advances were made availablemay now request an advance payment. Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 providesthat such a request must be made by November 1, 1989.The 1989 Act established the basic payment rates which will be used inmaking disaster payments. The actual payment rates will be 65 percent ofthe basic rate established for each crop.For producers who are participating in the 1989 acreage reduction programsfor target price commodities, the basic payment rate is the target priceof the commodity. For producers of target price commodities who are notenrolled in these programs, the basic payment rate is the basic countyloan rate established for the commodity. With respect to peanuts, the basicpayment rate is the national price support rate determined for quota peanutsor additional peanuts, as applicable. For sugar beets and sugarcane, thebasic payment rate will be set at a level which is fair and reasonablein relation to the level of price support established for the 1989 crops.With respect to kinds of tobacco for which price support loans are madeavailable, the basic payment rate is the national average loan rate. Forother kinds of tobacco, soybeans, sunflowers, and all other crops for whichpayments are authorized to be made by the 1989 Act, Commodity Credit Corporation(CCC) or the State Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation (ASC) committee,on behalf of CCC, shall establish the basic payment rate as the simpleaverage price received by producers of the commodity during the marketingyears for the immediately preceding five crops of the commodity, excludingthe year in which the average price was the highest and the year in whichthe average price was the lowest.The 1989 Act also provides that the Secretary shall consider as separatecrops and develop separate payment rates, insofar as is practicable, fordifferent varieties of the same commodity for which there is a significantdifference in economic value. Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 provides thatbasic payment rates will be established for separate varieties of the samecommodity taking into account market factors to the extent reliable datais available.For purposes of determining the total quantity of 1989 nonprogram cropsthat producers on a farm are able to harvest, the 1989 Act provides thatthe Secretary shall exclude as least 70 percent of: (1) Commodities thatcannot be sold in normal commercial channels of trade and; (2) dockage,including husks and shells, if such dockage is excluded in determiningthe yields used to establish the eligibility of producers on a farm toreceive a disaster payment. Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 provides that70 percent of such quantities will be excluded from actual production whenmaking loss of production determinations.The disaster payment acreage for producers of 1989 target price crops whoare participating in the 1989 acreage reduction programs is the sum ofthe acreage planted for harvest and the acreage prevented from being plantedto such crop because of a natural disaster as determined by the Secretarybut not to exceed the permitted acreage established for the farm for thecommodity. With respect to producers of the target price commodities whoare not participating in the 1989 acreage reduction programs, the disasterpayment acreage is the sum of the acreage planted for harvest and the acreagethat producers were prevented from planting to such crop because of a naturaldisaster as determined by the Secretary. Such prevented planting shallnot exceed the greater of: (1) The 1988 planted and approved preventedplanted acreage of the crop minus the 1989 actual planted acreage of thecrop or (2) a quantity equal to the average of the 1986, 1987, and 1988acreage planted and approved prevented planted acreage of the crop minusthe 1989 actual planted acreage of the crop. The amount of payments madeavailable, with respect to producers of target price commodities who arenot participating in the 1989 acreage reduction programs, is reduced bya factor equivalent to the acreage reduction percentage which was establishedfor the 1989 crop.Disaster payment acreage provisions of the 1989 Act which are applicableto peanuts, sugar beets, sugarcane, tobacco, soybeans, sunflowers, andnonprogram crops are similar to the provisions used to establish such acreagesfor producers of the 1989 target price commodities who are not participatingin the 1989 acreage reduction programs. Variations, however, exist withrespect to peanuts and tobacco to take into account increased 1989 marketingquotas which were established for these crops in accordance with the AgriculturalAdjustment Act of 1938, as amended. Deficiencies in production of peanutson a farm which are classified as quota will be based on the relationshipbetween farm poundage quota and the sum of the excepted production of quotaand additional peanuts. Such deficiencies in production of quota peanutsshall also take into consideration the quantity of poundage quota transferredfrom the farm for the 1989 crop year. The amount of undermarkertings attributableto a farm for the 1989 crop of burley or flue-cured tobacco or quota peanutsshall be reduced by the quantity for which a disaster payment is made toproducers on the farm. In the case of peanuts, this reduction may exceedthe actual undermarketings which would result in ``negative undermarketings.''Any negative undermarketings would be deducted when determining the subsequentyear's effective farm poundage quota. For all crops, adjustments in disaster payment acreages are made in orderto take into account crop rotation practices.In determining whether the producers on a farm have suffered a loss, the1989 farm program payment yield will be used for producers of the targetprice commodities. With respect to the determination of losses on a farmby producers of tobacco, sugarcane and sugar beets, the county averageyield is to be used. For peanuts, the program yield is required to be used.For soybeans and sunflowers, the 1989 Act specifies that the yield to beused shall be the State, area, or county yield adjusted for adverse weatherconditions during the previous three crops years, as determined by theSecretary.Nonprogram crop yields are based upon proven yields established from dataprovided by the producer for the immediately preceding three crop years.For any year data is not provided the county average yield, as determinedby CCC, shall be substituted. Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 provides thatthese yields, to the extent possible, will be based on statistics of theNational Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) or other sources whichCCC determines to be appropriate.The Secretary has determined not to exercise the discretionary authorityto make additional disaster payments for reductions in quality of 1989crops as a result of damaging weather or related condition in 1988 or 1989.Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 does not set forth regulations with respectto this provision.The 1989 Act provides that the quantity on which participating producersof the target price commodities would otherwise have earned deficiencypayments shall be reduced by the quantity on which a disaster payment hasbeen received. The 1989 Act also provides that if the Secretary determinesthat any producer participating in a 1989 program must refund any portionof the advance deficiency payment, because of the total deficiency paymentbeing less than the amount advanced, such refund shall not be requiredprior to July 31, 1990. Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 sets forth this provision.Producers participating in the 1989 acreage reduction programs may devoteall or a portion of the permitted acreage to conserving uses or receivedisaster payments in lieu of the payment which they would have receivedif the producers were, in fact, prevented from planting such acreage orthe acreage failed because of damaging weather or related condition in1988 or 1989. Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 provides that producers mustmake such an election, in writing, by November 1, 1989.The 1989 Act provides that producers who have obtained crop insurance forthe 1989 crop of a commodity, under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, asamended, shall have their disaster payment reduced by the amount whichthe sum of the net crop insurance benefits (gross indemnity less premiumpaid) and the computed disaster payment exceeds the disaster payment acreagetimes the disaster yield times the basic payment rate for the commodity.The 1989 Act also provides that producers who receive benefits under thisAct must agree to obtain multiple peril crop insurance, under the FederalCrop Insurance Act, as amended, for the 1990 crop of the commodity forwhich a 1989 disaster payment is made except when:(1) The producer's loss of production is less than 65 percent;(2) Crop insurance for the commodity is not available;(3) The amount of the producer's annual premium rate is greater than 125percent of the average premium rate for insurance on that commodity inthe county in which the producer is located;(4) The amount of the producer's annual premium is greater than 25 percentof the amount of payment received under the 1989 Act; or(5) The producer can establish, on appeal to the county ASC committee,that the purchase of crop insurance would impose an undue financial hardship.Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 sets forth the regulation which implementsthese provisions.The 1989 Act provides that for each ``person'' the sum of all 1989 disasterpayments made with respect to target price crops, peanuts, sugar beets,sugar cane, tobacco, soybeans, sunflowers and nonprogram crops shall notexceed $100,000. Additionally, the sum of such payments and the benefitsreceived in accordance with title VI of the 1949 Act which relate to 1989livestock feed losses may not exceed $100,000. The 1989 Act also providesthat no crop disaster payments are to be made to the extent that livestockemergency benefits have been made available for such loss of crop production.Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 sets forth these provisions.Producers may elect whether to receive benefits, up to the $100,000 limitunder the annual crop provisions of the 1989 Act or, in the form of livestockemergency benefits, up to the annual $50,000 limit in accordance with titleVI of the 1949 Act. For the purpose of applying the maximum payment limitationprovisions of the 1989 Act, ``person'' determinations are to be made tothe extent possible in accordance with the maximum payment limitation provisionsof the Food Security Act of 1985. For purposes of determining a ``person'',7 CFR part 1477 provides that the provisions of 7 CFR part 1497 shall beused. However, in the same manner noted previously concerning the grossrevenue determination which is made with respect to a ``person'', an individualor entity's interest in all entities will be taken into consideration whetheror not such entities are engaged in farming.The 1989 Act also provides that is producers on a farm receive disasterpayments, the amount of the payment will be reduced by the value of anyreplacement crop which is produced on the acreage for which the disasterpayment is made. The value of the replacement crop will be based on averagemarket prices and the actual production of the replacement crop. Therefore,25 percent of the production of the replacement crop will be deducted fromthe actual production of the replacement crop and the remaining quantitywill be multiplied by the market value of the crop. This amount will bededucted from the disaster payment which otherwise would be made to theproducer.The 1989 Act also specifies that the historical cropping patterns of producerswill be taken into consideration. Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1477 providesthat producers who normally double-crop the first and second crop on thefarm will not have the value of a crop which is normally the second cropplanted on the farm deducted from any disaster payment which is made withrespect to the crop normally planted as the first crop on the farm.The 1989 Act also provides that the Secretary may permit eligible producerswho have crop insurance on the 1989 crop or, in certain instances had cropinsurance on the 1988 crop, to substitute the crop insurance yield fora commodity for the program yield established under the 1989 Act. Due tothe differences between CCC programs and crop insurance programs with respectto: historical base periods for yield determinations; farm constitutions;the manner in which various croppig practices effect yield determinationsand other related issues, it has been determined that this option willnot be made available since it would unnecessarily complicate the disasterpayment program without resulting in a substantial enhancement of the programand would substantially increase the cost of the program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1477</ITAG>Disaster payment 1989 crops.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG>Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 1477 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1477_DISASTER PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR 1989 CROPS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.1 General statement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.2 Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.4 Availability of disaster payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.5 Disaster benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.6 Establishment of different payment rates and yields for thesame nonprogram crop.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.7 Filing application for payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.8 Report of acreage, production disposition, and indemnity payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.9 Payment limitations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.10 Special provisions for burley and flue-cured tobacco, andpeanuts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.11 Misrepresentation, scheme and device, and fraud.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.12 Refunds to CCC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.13 Cumulative liability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.14 Appeals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.15 Liens.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.16 Other regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1477.17 OMB control numbers assigned pursuant to the Paperwork ReductionAct.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Title I of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 (Pub.L. 101-82); 15 U.S.C. 714b and 714c.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1477.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General statement.</ITAG>This part sets forth the regulations for the Disaster Payment Program forthe 1989 crop year as provided by the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 (PublicLaw 101-82).
