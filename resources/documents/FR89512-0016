The latest revision of these specifications was September 1979.Since that date, significant changes have occurred within the telephoneindustry, including changes in construction materials, engineering designsand procedures, testing requirements and construction methods. These revisedforms incorporate these changes into the outside plant specifications.The major changes are the addition of new construction units for (1) buriedfilled fiber optic cable, (2) aerial filled fiber optic cable, (3) aerialfilled cable, (4) fiber optic splicing, (5) aerial, buried and undergroundsplice closures and organizers for fiber optic cables, (6) network interfacedevices, (7) handholes, and (8) underground fiber optic cable.

These incorporationsby reference were approved by the Director of the Federal Register on December30, 1983.These actions have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12291,Federal Regulation. These actions will not (1) have an annual effect onthe economy of $100 million or more; (2) result in a major increase incosts or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, orlocal government agencies, or geographic regions; (3) result in significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment or productivity,innovation, or on the ability of the United States-based enterprises tocompete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Therefore,these rules have been determined to be ``not major.''These actions do not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of these rules would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.432 <T3>et seq. </T3>[1976]) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment.This regulation contains no information or recordkeeping requirement whichrequires approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3507 <T3>et seq.</T3>).This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985), thisprogram is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.The availability of the specifications is set forth in the bulletins.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>REA has issued a series of publications entitled ``bulletins'' which serveto implement the policies, procedures and requirements for administeringits loan and loan guarantee programs and the security instruments whichprovide for and secure REA financing. In the bulletin series, REA issuesstandards and specifications for the construction of telephone facilitieswith REA loan funds. REA is revising REA Bulletins 345-150, 345-151, 345-152,345-153, and 345-154. These specifications were last revised in September1979. Since that time there have been many technical changes in telecommunications.New construction materials, such as fiber optic cable, filled aerial cable,and network interface devices, have been introduced. These new materialsrequire new construction and installation specifications. There have alsobeen changes in testing and grounding requirements and construction techniques.Following is a list of the main changes in each of the specifications:1.
