The axial mixing of liquid and solid particles waseffectively increased by introducing secondary gas into the homogeneousbubble flow which was found to prevail in liquefiers. The mean settlingvelocities of solid particles in the homogeneous bubble and heterogeneousbubble flow regimes as well as the turbulent flow regime were measured.With these parameters the growth and accumulation of ash particles weresimulated. The three-phase flow in horizontal conduits was also investigatedin terms of the pressure drop, phase holdup and axial dispersion coefficientof the liquid. The heat transfer coefficients between the pipe wall andthe three-phase flow were determined over a wide range of conditionsand were correlated including the data of the Wilsonville pilot plant.19 refs., 13 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
