Traders' confidence in the U.S. currency was bolstered by a Reagan administration official's comment that the dollar's recent strength shouldn't pose problems for U.S. industry.    The early selling came mostly in Tokyo, where investors took profits on the dollar's move above 150 Japanese yen, which began Tuesday. Other traders sold the dollar over Wednesday's rumor that the West German central bank was intervening to restrain its rise.    &quot;That seemed to sober the market a little bit and kept the bulls subdued,&quot; Joseph Volpicella, executive vice president of Spavo Financial Corp., a New York currency-trading firm, said.    In early European trading, the dollar slid to its intraday lows of 149.16 yen and 1.8325 West German marks.    By late yesterday in New York, the dollar had recovered to stand at 150.18 yen, still off slightly from 150.44 late Wednesday. It also stood at 1.8389 marks, compared with 1.8403 a day earlier. The British pound eased to $1.6180 from $1.6183.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 150.60 yen.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter helped the dollar by telling a news briefing he wasn't concerned about the currency's rise against the yen in recent days.    The dollar's rise above 150 yen Tuesday was its first in 3 1/2 months and caused speculation that the U.S. and its major allies might move to weaken the currency. Washington has been trying to maintain a relatively low exchange rate for the dollar to make U.S. products more competitive in world markets and reduce the U.S. trade deficit.    Mr. Yeutter said U.S. exports are still competitive at an exchange rate of 150 yen and that the current yen-dollar rate won't abort a rise in U.S. exports to Japan. &quot;We are competitive in a lot of things at that rate,&quot; he said.    Separately, a Bank of Norway official confirmed that the central bank has intervened to damp the Norwegian krone's rise over the past several days.    Arne Lie, a Bank of Norway director, declined to specify the size of the intervention or the currencies the bank has been purchasing. But participants in the Oslo foreign exchange market estimated that between 300 million and 400 million kroner ($44.7 million to $59.6 million) had been sold each day this week, chiefly for dollars. In addition, Bank of Norway statistics show that the central bank sold about 1.4 billion kroner in the last five days of June to halt the currency's rise.    Traders said the krone continues to be bolstered by renewed political stability in Norway, high interest rates of 14% to 15%, firming oil prices and an improved economic outlook.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 10 cents an ounce to $444.90 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $445.45 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Thursday, July 9, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
