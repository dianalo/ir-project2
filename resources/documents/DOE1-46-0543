The pole vector representingjoint orientations is regionalized and projected on a plane normal tothe mean attitude of the joint family and centered at the mean. A two-dimensionalcutoff system is developed to define the indicator variable, and correspondingindicator variograms and indicator kriging. The cutoff system definesprobability regions similar to those of a bivariate distribution, concentricrings sliced into radial sectors. A case study made on an open pit mineproved positively the efficiency of IK and encourages its applicationsto localized probabilistic structural modeling for geotechnical or geohydrologicalanalysis and oil and gas reservoir analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
