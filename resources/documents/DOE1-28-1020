Due tothe size of the ribbon target, the anti p emittances can be as smallas a few mm.mrad, while the momentum bite is quite large (say 5%); themomentum resolution, on the other hand, can also be small, perhaps 0.1%,depending on the detailed design of the secondary beam optics. Thereare in principle four methods of cooling a particle beam: (1) radiationcooling; (2) electron cooling; (3) ionization cooling, and (4) stochasticcooling. The authors discuss there in turn. Beam storage is also outlined.</TEXT></DOC>
