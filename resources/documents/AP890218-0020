The disagreement, to be aired before a House panel Tuesday, isunlikely to suggest a solution to legislators wondering what to doabout gases that trap heat like the glass roof of a gardengreenhouse.   The searing heat wave and severe drought that afflicted manyareas last summer often was blamed on the theory that the earth isslowly warming because of such a phenomenon.   Experts agree there is a greenhouse effect, but also realizethey're gazing into ``a very dirty crystal ball,'' according to awitness scheduled to testify Tuesday before the House Energy andCommerce energy and power subcommittee.   ``The tough problem is how long we clean the glass before we acton what we think we see inside,'' according to Stephen H. Schneider,of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.   Schneider has written that immediate environmental action must betaken as an insurance policy against ``the uncomfortable risks offuture grim surprises.''   But Patrick J. Michaels, a University of Virginia professor ofenvironmental sciences, will caution the subcommittee against actinghastily on a ``clouded vision,'' because lawmakers may take actionthey'll regret. Michaels has warned against ``public hysteria'' and``the politics of fear.''   ``Suppose you pass a `carbon use fee' for gasoline,'' he said inan interview. ``That can have serious economic effects. You bettermake sure you have the bases covered.'' His reference was to apolicy calculated to reduce the release into the atmosphere ofcarbon gases, a major contributor to the greenhouse effect.   The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earth's atmospheretrap radiant heat near the planet's surface _ the more gases, themore heat.   The gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than theyare to outgoing infrared energy. Mars, a planet with a thin,predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere, has a mean temperature thatis below that of deep freezers. Venus, with a thick, largely carbondioxide atmosphere, is hotter than an oven.   The earth's atmosphere, on the other hand, has been just right tosupport life.   Greenhouse gases have built up due to burning of fossil fuels _coal, oil and natural gas _ and destruction of tropical rain forests.   The difficulty is in guessing how much greenhouse gases willincrease in the future, and what effect they will have on climate,the experts say.   The answer, Michaels said in the interview, is ``just veryunclear right now.''   Michaels said there is evidence the earth is warming less thanwould be expected, and some indication that much of the warmingoccurred at night _ a development that could trigger beneficialeffects like a longer growing season.   ``If we base rational environmental policy on the greenhouseeffect, and it turns out over the next few years it's not going towarm up as much as some people feared ... the basis of that policywill have lost its credibility,'' he said. ``You can wind up settingback the progress on these important environmental matters anotherdecade or two.''   Michaels fears no one will heed such a cautionary view the firstreally hot day of summer, when people start ``screaming you have todo something now.''   The Virginia professor said he supports taking actions that couldalleviate greenhouse buildup, if they're done for otherenvironmental reasons. An example, he said, would be stopping thedestruction of tropical rain forests.   Schneider adopts a more forceful ``tie-in'' strategy, that wouldbe designed partly to reduce greenhouse gases, while simultaneouslyproviding other benefits unrelated to climate.   This strategy envisions more efficient use of energy, includingstrict opposition to weakening automobile gasoline mileagestandards, he said.   Other ideas: development of non-fossil fuel energy supplies,including solar and a new generation of nuclear plants; and helpingdeveloping countries deploy alternative technologies that canprovide economic development with less pollution.</TEXT></DOC>
