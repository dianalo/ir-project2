The search for an optimal variant of the trapmagnetic system was conducted empirically. A large number of variantswas considered, differing from each other in the shape, dimensions andrelative position of magnet coils. It is shown, that in order to allowpassage of 0.3-0.5 W magnetic flux from loading cell into cusp, the cuspmagnet internal diameter should be sufficiently large. Application ofcopper windings cooled by liquid nitrogen, appears to be the optimalvariant for producing maximal magnetic fields. 11 refs.; 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
