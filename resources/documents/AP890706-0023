Rehnquist leadingand Ronald Reagan's three appointees right with him.   The Rehnquist court came of age as it cut back abortion rights,curtailed affirmative action for women and minorities, limited othercivil rights protections, condoned mandatory drug testing andpermitted capital punishment for juvenile and retarded killers.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy tipped the balance of power. In hisfirst full term, he solidified a comparatively youthful conservativemajority that prevailed in a series of important 5-4 votes.   Thus with three appointments, former President Reaganaccomplished what Richard M. Nixon failed to do with four _fundamentally reshape the nation's highest court, and perhaps thefuture of American law as well.   Reagan named Sandra Day O'Connor to the court in 1981, thenpromoted Rehnquist and appointed Antonin Scalia in 1986 after ChiefJustice Warren E. Burger retired. Kennedy joined them early lastyear.   Allied with Rehnquist and Byron R. White, who was appointed byPresident John F. Kennedy in 1962, the Reagan appointees are now incontrol.   Conservatives two years ago were panning Rehnquist's first termas chief justice, dejectedly admitting that he had beenoutmaneuvered and overshadowed by William J. Brennan, the court'sleading liberal.   Rehnquist clearly assumed a leadership role the next year, butnot without joining in some surprising rulings that sparkedcommentators to say he had moderated his staunchly conservativeideology.   ``Statesmanlike'' is what some conservatives called Rehnquist'sperformance in the court's 1987-88 term. But Kennedy's votes in thejust-completed term allowed Rehnquist to be Rehnquist again,standard-bearer for the causes conservatives hold most dear.   Two major exceptions to the court's conservative path through1970s and 1980s _ abortion and civil rights _ are exceptions no more.   Waiting until the last day of the 1988-89 term to announce adecision in its mostly closely watched case of the decade, the courtgave states far greater power to regulate abortion.   The immediate impact: Abortions are likely to become harder toget.   The implications: It now appears much more likely the court willreverse its 1973 decision, in Roe vs. Wade, that women have aconstitutional right to abortion. Reversal, which could come asearly as next year, would allow states to outlaw most abortions.   A clear majority _ Rehnquist, White, Scalia, Kennedy and O'Connor_ believe Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided. Only O'Connor'sreluctance to throw out the 1973 ruling stopped the court this time,but three new abortion disputes will be on the court's docket whenit ends its summer recess in October.   In other key rulings this term, the court:   _Made it more difficult for minorities and women to proveon-the-job bias by using statistics.   _Gave white men more power to challenge court-approvedaffirmative action plans helping minorities and women as unlawful``reverse discrimination.''   _Shielded states and state officials from some civil rightslawsuits.   _Made it more difficult to sue cities when their employeesviolate someone's civil rights.   _Limited the scope of a key civil rights law, ruling that it doesnot apply to racial or sexual harassment in employment.   _Ruled that states may not be sued under a federal law aimed atbettering the educational opportunities of handicapped people.   _Said federal prosecutors may seize the assets of defendants evenif those assets were going to be used to hire a lawyer.   _Ruled that states are not obligated to provide free lawyers todeath row inmates who lose their initial round of appeals.   _Ruled that the death penalty may be imposed on convictedmurderers who were as young as 16 when they committed their crime.   _Ruled that capital punishment also may be imposed for mentallyretarded killers.   _Ruled that police may vary from the precise wording of thefamous Miranda warnings before questioning suspects, even if theresult arguably is confusing.   Each of those rulings came on 5-4 votes. In each, Brennan andJustices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevensdissented.   In less polarized voting, the court also:   _Upheld the use of mandatory blood and urine testing for railroadworkers involved in accidents and for U.S. Customs employees seekingdrug-enforcement jobs.   _Allowed law enforcement agents to stop, question and even searchairline passengers whose looks or actions in some way fit the``profile'' characteristics of a drug courier.   _Ruled that states may use anti-racketeering laws to prosecutepornographic bookstores, but barred the states from closing down thebookstores before such cases go to trial.   The court's liberal wing, although most often in dissent, was notwithout its significant victories.   Most notably, Brennan wrote for a 5-4 majority that includedKennedy and Scalia when the court ruled that burning the Americanflag is a constitutionally protected form of political protest.   And Brennan was the author when the court ruled, 5-4, thatsentencing juries may not consider a murder victim's personal traitswhen deciding whether the killer should receive life in prison ordeath. Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy dissented.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Richard Carelli has covered the Supreme Court forThe Associated Press since 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
