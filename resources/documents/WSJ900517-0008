The work for his PTL brought Laventhol fees of $180,000 ayear -- and a lawsuit seeking $184 million in damages fromLaventhol and many other defendants.</LP><TEXT>   The suit is only one of a series directed at Laventhol,which over the past three years has been forced to pay outmore than $50 million for allegedly sloppy audit,financial-statement and tax work. After insurance recoveries,it was still out at least $20 million. Two years ago,Laventhol also suffered the distinction of being the firstaccounting firm to lose a jury trial under the federalanti-racketeering law.   Laventhol, once one of the nation's fastest-growingaccounting firms and now the seventh-largest (425 partners in51 offices), has hit hard times. Key employees are leaving.An important Canadian affiliate has defected to PriceWaterhouse. Laventhol's operating profits, prior to legalcosts, have declined in the past two years. Lenders are saidto be pushing it to sell major units.   What caused such a decline? Consultants to accountingfirms say Philadelphia-based Laventhol, which acquired nofewer than 70 other firms between 1968 and 1980, grew tooquickly. From 1980 to 1986, its annual revenue surged almostfourfold to $275 million; since then it has grown 28% more,to $345 million.   &quot;Laventhol was overly aggressive doing some mergers thatit shouldn't have done and therefore probably didn't pay asmuch attention&quot; as it should have to the quality of the firmsit was buying and of the new clients it was picking up, saysJay Nisberg, a Ridgefield, Conn., consultant. &quot;It may soon bescrambling for a merger to stay afloat.&quot; Laventhol won'tcomment.   Lawrence Reisman, a former Laventhol tax supervisor,thinks he knows why the firm got into trouble. He and manyothers in accounting believe that Laventhol took too manyrisky clients like PTL -- a strategy that, ironically,accountants often advise their clients to avoid.   When he was at Laventhol in late 1982, Mr. Reisman and hisboss, Martin Helpern, sent a memo to the managing partner ofthe New York office recommending that the firm drop a Houstonoil-drilling tax shelter as a client. Laventhol was getting$150,000 a year to do the shelter's tax and audit work. ButMessrs. Reisman and Helpern said expenses that the shelter,Terra Drill andamp; Heavy Oil, was deducting to sublicense a newdrill gun &quot;are not a valid business deduction.&quot; Theyquestioned whether Laventhol's reputation is &quot;enhanced by ourassociation with this type of sham.&quot;   The New York managing partner, Leonard Douglas, rejectedthe advice. &quot;Every person is entitled to be represented by ascompetent a professional as he can get,&quot; he wrote back. &quot;Evenin criminal law, there is a guaranteed right under theconstitution. The client is entitled to representation.&quot; Mr.Douglas recently retired; messages left for him at Laventholweren't returned.   Unfortunately for Laventhol, Messrs. Reisman and Helpernproved prophetic. The Internal Revenue Service laterdisallowed all the deductions claimed by Terra's investors.In a deposition taken by investor-plaintiffs in a subsequentclass-action lawsuit, Neil Kran, an IRS engineer whoinvestigated Terra, said the shelter's &quot;sublicense fees areunsupported by the value of the rights acquired.&quot; Terraofficials defended the fees but said they needed more time tomake the drill commercially feasible.   In 1986, the class-action lawsuit, filed in federaldistrict court in Houston, charged that Laventhol helpedmislead hundreds of investors into buying allegedlyfraudulent limited partnerships in Terra. The suit contendedthat the investors lost $42 million. Last December, a federaljury returned a $72 million judgment, including interest,against Laventhol for allegedly violating anti-fraud statutesin working for the shelter.   Laventhol settled the suit early this year for $13.5million, of which only $4.4 million was covered by insurance.Richard Drubel, a Houston attorney who represented theinvestors who sued, says, &quot;We offered to settle the casebefore trial for $5 million. Apparently, Laventhol likes totake risks. They lost this one, too.&quot;   As for other matters, Laventhol confirms the recent lossof its Toronto affiliate, with its 30 partners and 200professional staffers, to Price Waterhouse; Eric Slavens,co-managing partner in Toronto, says the affiliate needed&quot;more cross-country coverage for clients in Canada.&quot;   Laventhol declines to comment on its other problems. Thiswould be only a &quot;rehashing of past situations and innuendoand unattributed false claims,&quot; the firm says. Robert N.Levine, who will assume the top post at Laventhol on June 1and is actually running the firm now, declines to go beyondthis.   Laventhol's recent payouts in legal settlements areenormous and are stretching the firm's insurance coverage. Anout-of-court settlement in Chicago last October with ninecreditor banks in a holding-company bankruptcy cost Laventholat least $30 million. Of that, only $18.5 million was coveredby insurance.   In 1988, Laventhol paid $15 million in an out-of-courtsettlement of the suit it lost under RICO, the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations law. The firm has saidthe settlement was covered by insurance. In that case, infederal court in Sacramento, Calif., the jury found thatinvestors, relying on Laventhol's audits of fraudulentcattle-breeding tax shelters, put more than $20 million intothe partnerships, which then collapsed and resulted in taxpenalties for the investors.   Laventhol still isn't free of lawsuits allegingprofessional negligence. In 1988, shareholders of ConvenientFood Mart charged in a state court in Chicago that Laventhol,the food-store franchiser's auditor in 1986 and 1987, didn'tadequately review and check work papers and other informationprepared by Convenient. In mid-1988, Convenient stunnedsecurities analysts by disclosing that it had overstated 1987profits by 68%.   Another case involved a report issued by Laventhol forWieboldt Stores Inc. in 1985. The report stated that aleveraged buy-out of the store chain wouldn't make itinsolvent. Former Wieboldt stockholder-managers, who weresued in Chicago federal court by Wieboldt's bankruptcytrustee for allegedly running the company into the ground,charged in their own suit in the same court that Laventholhad misrepresented the retailer's finances.   Laventhol has denied allegations in both of thesestill-pending cases but declines to comment further.   Laventhol also must regret taking on the PTL ministry.After Deloitte, Haskins andamp; Sells (later merged with ToucheRoss to form Deloitte andamp; Touche) was dropped for unexplainedreasons by the PTL in 1984, Laventhol took the job a yearlater.   In 1987, a group of investors with &quot;lifetime memberships&quot;in the PTL sued Mr. Bakker and others, including Laventhol,in federal court in Charlotte, N.C. They charged that the PTLhad perpetrated a massive fraud against them. The suitalleges that Laventhol helped Mr. Bakker &quot;cook the books&quot; andturn a $19 million loss into a $26 million profit in thefiscal year ended May 31, 1986. It says Laventhol permittedthe PTL to change the method of amortizing lifetime partnerincome to &quot;convey to bankers and other outside partners afalse sense of solvency.&quot;   PTL directors, the suit says, were &quot;lulled into a falsesense of security&quot; about PTL's finances by Mr. Bakker. Thesuit says he told them the PTL &quot;had excellent accountants,that it had internal control by certified public accountants{and} that it had external audits by reputable firms.&quot;   The suit also charges that $60,000 of the annual $180,000audit fee that Laventhol collected was &quot;to manage a secretbank account&quot; that the PTL allegedly used to concealembezzlement by some of its top officers. The suit says thePTL's vice president for finance wasn't allowed to know whatwas in the account but &quot;the outside auditors {Laventhol}maintained a running account of the funds.&quot;   The PTL has collapsed, and Mr. Bakker has gone to prisonafter being found guilty of financial fraud. In 1987, afterMr. Bakker resigned from the PTL amid the scandal, hissuccessors replaced Laventhol as PTL's accountant with ArthurAndersen andamp; Co., which worked for six months to help the PTLclear up its books.   In court filings in response to the lifetime investors,Laventhol has noted that it criticized PTL's accountingcontrols and qualified PTL's 1986 annual report -- that is,indicated that it had some reservations about PTL's finances.As to the bank account, Laventhol told the Washington Postthat it wasn't &quot;secret&quot; but was a &quot;clerical payroll&quot; accountthat didn't compromise Laventhol's independence as anauditor. Laventhol declines to comment further.   Another black eye for Laventhol was its work for GrabillCorp., a Chicago real-estate firm run by William J. Stoecker.Mr. Stoecker's empire crumbled early in 1989 when it wasforced to seek bankruptcy-court protection. Last January inChicago federal court, Mr. Stoecker was found not guilty ofcriminal charges of bankruptcy fraud for allegedly failing toturn over records to the Chicago bankruptcy court. But hisactivities are still under investigation by the U.S.Attorney's office in Chicago.   Mr. Stoecker, his lawyer says, isn't available forcomment. However, in an interview on the CBS program &quot;60Minutes&quot; early this year, Mr. Stoecker was asked whetherLaventhol should have been able to see his company was introuble. He replied that it should have taken the accountants&quot;no more than a day or two to look at&quot; his books and see thecompany had questionable assets and was low on cash.   According to papers filed by the trustee in the Chicagobankruptcy court, Laventhol's last audit of Grabill, on June30, 1988, showed $390 million in assets, including $68.6million in real estate. Grabill Trustee Jay Steinberg says,&quot;We cannot reconcile the books to the audit. We found lessthan $2 million in real estate.&quot;   Laventhol was charging Grabill a fee of close to $1million a year -- considered exorbitant by many in theaccounting profession. Lee Seidler, a former accountingprofessor at New York University and special associatedirector of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., the major securities firm,says such a huge fee for a small real-estate operation raises&quot;obvious questions.&quot; He adds: &quot;A million dollars a year iswhat Bear Stearns pays for its audit. Laventhol failed toemploy one fundamental practice for auditors -- kick thetires.&quot;   Laventhol declines to comment.   Although Mr. Levine, who's currently running Laventhol, isassumed to be tuning down Laventhol's hunger for new, riskybusiness, the firm may be showing questionable judgment inhiring some new executives. Last March, its Chicago officehired Andrew Doppelt, a former Internal Revenue Serviceagent, to head a new financial investigative operation. WhatLaventhol apparently didn't know was that Mr. Doppelt wasbeing criticized for exaggerating the sales of NationalInvestigative Services Corp., a company that he helped foundseveral years ago and that went out of business earlier thisyear.   National Investigative Services was ranked 125th in thenation in growth of private companies by Inc. magazine lastyear with 1988 sales of $4.7 million. But John Case, an Inc.senior writer, says now that the company's sales two yearsago &quot;weren't anywhere near $4.7 million.&quot; Mr. Case says thebigger figure was supplied to Inc. in a letter signed by Mr.Doppelt. Mr. Doppelt denies the figure came from him,attributing it to a company sales employee he refuses toname.   Sheldon Epstein, who heads Laventhol's Chicago office,says National Investigative Services' 1988 sales were &quot;alittle over $1 million.&quot; Asked why Laventhol hired Mr.Doppelt in light of the questionable sales figures, Mr.Epstein says: &quot;Maybe Andy's ability to run a business isn'tas good as his ability to service clients. He is one of thebest professionals at helping trustees uncover assets after abankruptcy and finding individuals who counterfeit productswithout paying royalties. We feel we can manage him withoutany problems.&quot;   In the wake of Laventhol's troubles, a raft of topLaventhol executives are leaving the firm. For example,Steven Matthews, a former Laventhol employee-benefitsconsultant in Phoenix, Ariz., says he left last March&quot;because of the litigation problems.&quot;   Mr. Reisman, the former Laventhol man who urged caution,left the firm in 1983 and now has a New York tax practice. Hesays he was upset about Laventhol's professional standards.&quot;The urge to take such risks there was too ferocious,&quot; hesays. &quot;The dog-eat-dog atmosphere and knowledge that if youweren't willing to cut a corner, someone else would be foundthere who will, was too much for me.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
