Clay Moritz, Jr. or Jack M.Calloway, Office of Aviation Information Management, DAI-1, Research andSpecial Programs Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 SeventhStreet SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366-4385 and 366-4383, respectively.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) issued March 16, 1988, the Departmentproposed to adopt a policy of relying, to the maximum extent practicable,on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as promulgated by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the recognized body of accountingprinciples, for recording large certificated air carrier financial information(Notice 88-5; 53 FR 9653, March 24, 1988). As noted in the proposed rule,the FASB is recognized as the primary body that is responsible for developingand overseeing accounting principles and disclosure standards for Americanbusiness.Essentially, the Department proposed to modify the Part 241 uniform accountingprovisions for large certificated air carriers by:1. Clarifying certain definitions contained in glossary Section 03 andeliminating those definitions that are either already defined by GAAP orno longer needed in the current transportation environment;2. Eliminating the repetition of GAAP in the Department's general accountingprovisions that are contained in Sections 1 ``Introduction to System ofAccounts and Reports,'' 2 ``General Accounting Policies,'' and 5 ``BalanceSheet Account Groupings''; and3. Eliminating certain balance sheet and profit and loss accounts thatare no longer required for either GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements.While the NPRM proposed that air carriers be allowed to adopt changes inGAAP at the same time for both financial and regulatory accounting purposes,it also contained a mechanism for resolving conflicts when the Department'sregulatory needs for financial data cannot be met through the adoptionof a particular GAAP pronouncement. In such situations, the NPRM providedthat the Department's Office of Aviation Information Management would issuean Accounting Directive explaining in detail why a particular GAAP pronouncementcould not be adopted for regulatory accounting purposes. It was furtherproposed that the Department's needs would be addressed in a notice ofproposed rulemaking if significant objections were raised.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments</ITAG>The Department has decided to finalize its revisions to the uniform largecertificated air carrier accounting provisions as proposed. Trans WorldAirlines, Inc. (TWA) filed the only comment to the rulemaking notice. TWAagreed with and fully supported the proposed changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statement of Cash Flows</ITAG>In a related matter that furthers the objectives of this rulemaking, theDepartment wishes to address at this time the impact of Financial AccountingStandard (FAS) No. 95 ``Statement of Cash Flows.'' This statement modifiesgenerally accepted accounting principles by requiring all business enterprisesto include a ``statement of cash flows'' as part of a full set of financialstatements. Under FAS No. 95, the cash flow statement replaces the statementof changes in financial position.FAS-95 represents a significant philosophical change in the concept ofreporting point-in-time financial position. Cash flow statements focuson cash receipts and payments and explain changes in cash and cash equivalents.Funds flow statements, on the other hand, are prepared on a broader conceptof the enterprise's economic activity so as to encompass all the changesin financial position. For example, a funds flow statement would includedepreciation expense, amortization expense and increases in deferred incometaxes as sources of funds in calculating changes in financial position.None of these three items are included in preparing a cash flow statementsince they do not affect a firm's cash position.The financial schedules that comprise RSPA Form 41 ``Report of Financialand Operating Statistics for Large Certificated Air Carriers'' for carrierswith total annual operating revenues of $10 million or more include SchedulesB-1 ``Balance Sheet,'' B-12 ``Statement of Changes in Financial Position,''and P-1.2 ``Statement of Operations.'' While the inclusion of these threeschedules in Form 41 is based on the value of the information to the Departmentin administering its aviation responsibilities, it also reflects the significancethat has been historically placed on these types of reports by the accountingprofession and the financial community. Because of this similarity of financialdata requirements, carriers have been able to fulfill their financial andregulatory reporting responsibilities by developing a management informationsystem that collects financial data in a manner that facilitates the generationof a balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of changes infinancial position.The private sector's adoption of FAS No. 95 and the Department's ScheduleB-12 reporting requirement have combined to create a problem for carriermanagement information systems by requiring the reporting of point-in-timefinancial position based on two different perspectives: funds flow versuscash flow. This has created a practical data gathering problem for aircarriers since funds flow and cash flow statements require the extractionand maintenance of a different subset of financial information from thecarrier's data base in order to generate the respective reports.While the Department believes that a cash flow statement would be usefulin administering its aviation programs, it also feels that changing ScheduleB-12 from a funds flow to a cash flow format involves a change in reportingthat is significant enough to warrant addressing the issue through therulemaking process. At the same time, the Department is very concernedabout the additional reporting burden that carriers must bear until therulemaking process can be completed.Because of this concern, the Department has considered various ways ofreducing or eliminating this burden, and has decided to accept waiver requestsfrom affected air carriers to enable them, upon a proper showing of needand a finding by the Department, to file a cash flow statement in lieuof the current Schedule B-12. Each waiver request must be accompanied bya pro forma example of the format the carrier proposes to use in lieu ofSchedule B-12. Waiver requests must be addressed to the Director, Officeof Aviation Information Management, DAI-1, RSPA, Department of Transportation,Washington, DC 20590.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of GAAP</ITAG>By virtue of this final rule, the Department adopts a policy of relyingon GAAP, as promulgated by the FASB, as the recognized body of accountingprinciples for recording air carrier financial information. In adoptingthis policy, the Department recognizes the possibility that a situationmay arise where a change in GAAP could adversely affect the Department'sability to administer its aviation responsibilities. In this circumstance,the Department's Office of Aviation Information Management will issue anAccounting Directive fully explaining why the application of the accountingprinciple in question would negatively impact administration of the Department'saviation programs. The directive also will provide the necessary accountingguidance required to maintain the accounting integrity of the Department'sUniform System of Accounts and Reports for Large Certificated Air Carriers.If significant objections are raised by any concerned party or partiesto the Department's decision not to implement a particular accounting principle,such objections would be addressed in a notice of proposed rulemaking.Air carriers and any other concerned parties will be encouraged to submittheir views and comments on the issues raised. After due deliberation ofall comments received, the Department will issue a final rule, statingits conclusions. It should be noted that the Department's decision to rely on GAAP-basedaccounting has caused it to retain, rather than eliminate as proposed,account 2860, Subscribed and Unissued Stock. This will allow affected aircarriers to account for and disclose the results of stock subscriptiontransactions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Because of this, section 3, Chart of Balance Sheet Accounts, will be editoriallyrevised to include account 2860, which had previously been inadvertentlyomitted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Department Regulatory Policies and Procedures</ITAG>Executive Orders 12291, 12612 and 12630; Department's Regulatory Policiesand Procedures; Regulatory Flexibility Act; and Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980. This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it has beendetermined that this is not a major rule. It will not result in an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be no increasein production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State or local governments, agencies or geographic regions. Furthermore,this rule will not adversely affect competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.These regulations will result in a reduction in reporting burden for largecertificated air carriers. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis isnot required. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Orders 12612 and 12630 and it has been determinedthat the final rule: (1) does not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment and (2) does notpose the risk of a taking of constitutionally protected private property.This regulation is significant under the Department's Regulatory Policiesand Procedures, dated February 26, 1979, because it involves importantDepartmental policies. Its economic impact should be minimal and a fullregulatory evaluation is not required. I certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. For purposes of its aviation economicregulations, Departmental policy categorizes certificated air carriersoperating small aircraft (60 seats or less or 18,000 pounds maximum payloador less) in strictly domestic service as small entities for purposes ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act. The regulatory amendments will affect onlylarge certificated air carriers. The accounting requirements in this proposal are subject to the PaperworkReduction Act, Pub. L. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. A request for clearanceof these requirements will be submitted to the Office of Management andBudget for review. It is anticipated that this rule will result in an annualburden reduction of 17 hours per carrier. Taking into account this reduction,the total estimated annual burden associated with this information collection(OMB Clearance No. 2138-0013) is 502 hours per carrier which representsthe estimated burden associated with the Department's Uniform System ofAccounts and Reports for Large Certificated Air Carriers.
