The ruling, which was based on the agreement to arbitrateall disputes that is contained in the standard registrationform for securities brokers, is likely to mean thatsecurities firms may also require brokers to arbitrate claimsof race or sex bias on the job.</LP><TEXT>   The high court, however, didn't settle the much broaderissue of whether job discrimination claims may be subjectedto arbitration agreements contained in many individualemployment contracts in a wide range of businesses andindustries. Employers hoped and civil rights groups fearedthat the high court would open the door to arbitration of allemployment discrimination suits. But the high court said thatissue wasn't raised in the case decided yesterday.   Civil rights groups are concerned that forcing jobdiscrimination disputes to arbitration would depriveemployees of access to the courts where they can seek broaderrelief and have their legal fees paid by the employers ifthey win.   &quot;Civil rights cases . . . require the public forum of acourtroom and the wide discretion that only a court has tofashion remedies that go beyond the interests of the privatelitigants,&quot; said the Lawyers' Committee for Civil RightsUnder Law in a brief.   Business groups, however, say that yesterday's ruling isthe first step toward a decision enforcing agreements toarbitrate all forms of employment discrimination disputes.&quot;The justices are dropping a pretty heavy hint that if a caselike that arose, they might look favorably upon it,&quot; saidMona Zeiberg, a lawyer with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce'sNational Chamber Litigation Center.   The case decided yesterday was filed by a former seniorvice president and broker with Interstate Securities Corp., aNorth Carolina brokerage firm. Robert Gilmer sued the firm,which has since changed its name to Interstate/Johnson LaneInc., after he was fired in 1987 at age 62.   Mr. Gilmer's suit alleged age discrimination, but thebrokerage firm moved for an arbitration order. In signing thestandard broker registration form, Mr. Gilmer agreed to abideby the arbitration requirements of the exchange. The New YorkStock Exchange rules call for arbitration of employmentdisputes between brokerage firms and their representatives. Afederal district court declined to require arbitration in thecase, but a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., reversedthe decision and said the arbitration agreement should beenforced.   In a 7-2 decision, written by Justice Byron White, thehigh court said the arbitration agreement in the brokerageregistration should be enforced. Business and civil rightslawyers said yesterday that they saw no reason why the agebias ruling wouldn't also apply to race and sex bias in thesecurities industry.   The court said it was expressing no view on the broaderissue of whether the Federal Arbitration Act, passed in 1925,exempts from arbitration all claims arising from employmentagreements.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Stevens, joined byJustice Thurgood Marshall, said the court should rule thatthe law doesn't require arbitration of employer-employeedisputes. (Gilmer vs. Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc.)                                                                                                          Taxing Friendly Takeovers                                                                                                          The justices agreed to decide whether the costs ofarranging a friendly corporate takeover are ordinary businessexpenses that are tax deductible. The high court agreed tohear an appeal by Indopco Inc., which was known as NationalStarch andamp; Chemical Corp. before it was acquired by UnileverGroup in 1978.   National Starch claimed a deduction of $2.23 million paidto its investment banker, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., and $650,000in fees to its attorneys and others. The Tax Court said thepayments were capital expenditures and not deductible, ratherthan ordinary and necessary business expenses that aredeductible. In November 1990, a federal appeals court inPhiladelphia upheld the Tax Court ruling.   Although the Justice Department and the Internal RevenueService agreed with the appeals court, they urged the highcourt to hear the case because the federal courts are dividedon how to decide what is a capital expenditure. (Indopco Inc.vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue)                                                                                                          Workers' Compensation                                                                                                          The justices will hear a challenge by General Motors Corp.and Ford Motor Co. to a 1987 Michigan workers' compensationlaw that the companies say could cost them $25 million inworkers' refunds.   In 1981, Michigan allowed employers to reduce workers'compensation payments by the amounts paid in other employeebenefits so that injured workers wouldn't receive morebenefits than their salary would have been if they were stillworking. In 1985, the Michigan Supreme Court interpreted the1981 law to apply to all disability payments after March1982, when the law took effect, even if the injury occurredbefore the law was passed.   The auto companies then offset workers' compensationbenefits against other benefits for accidents that occurredprior to March 1982. In 1987, however, the MichiganLegislature said that the state supreme court was wrong andthat the 1981 law wasn't meant to apply to accidents thatoccurred before the law was passed. The Legislature orderedemployers to pay with interest past amounts that were offsetfor accidents before March 1982.   The auto manufacturers challenged the 1987 change in thelaw as an unconstitutional violation of the right to makecontracts and of the guarantee of &quot;due process.&quot; But inSeptember 1990, the Michigan Supreme Court upheld the 1987law by a 5-2 vote. The decision was stayed while the autocompanies appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. (General MotorsCorp. vs. Romein)                                                                                                          Conrail Appeal                                                                                                          The high court refused to hear an appeal by ConsolidatedRail Corp., clearing the way for a trial of an antitrustlawsuit against it by Delaware andamp; Hudson Railway Co., whichsued in 1986 over rates for carrying newsprint in the easternUnited States from Canada. The refusal to hear the appeal wassurprising, since the court asked for the views of theJustice Department and then disregarded the solicitorgeneral's recommendation that it hear the appeal.Philadelphia-based Conrail said it was &quot;disappointed that theSupreme Court has declined to review the matter at this time.The case will, therefore, go back to the District Court whereConrail will seek a prompt trial on the merits.&quot; (Conrail vs.Delaware andamp; Hudson Railway Co.)                                                                                                          ZZZZ Best Case                                                                                                          The justices agreed to settle a bankruptcy-law issue thatarose in the proceedings involving ZZZZ Best Co., thecarpet-cleaning company whose founder, Barry Minkow, isserving a 25-year prison sentence for his role in thecompany's fraud.   The high court will hear an appeal by Union Bank, a unitof Bank of Tokyo Ltd. The issue is whether a bankruptcytrustee may recover interest payments that a company made toa bank up to 90 days before it filed for bankruptcy-courtprotection. The bankruptcy trustee sued Union Bank and won ina federal appeals court in San Francisco.
