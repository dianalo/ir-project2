Charles ``Curt'' McRae, a pilot fired two years after he turnedin his supervisors, also will receive back pay under the orderfiled Thursday by Administrative Law Judge Phillip N. Miller.   Miller said McRae's appeal to the Merit System Protection Boardhad supported his allegation that his firing was in reprisal foractivity protected under a federal law that protects whistleblowers.   The decision by Miller will become final on May 3 unless a partyto the matter appeals to the merit board, or the board decides toreopen the case.   ``I am very happy, I mean very happy, that the judge looked atall the facts and ruled in our favor,'' McRae said in a telephoneinterview Friday from his home.   McRae said he had at times doubted he would be vindicated in thebattle with his superiors at the northern Illinois base.   ``This will kind of reaffirm that if you're willing to wait andbe persistent, the system will work, yes,'' McRae said.   McRae, who has been looking for other work, said he wants to goback to his military job, but would report violations again if hesaw them.   Al Schwartz, an Army spokesman at the arsenal, said there was noimmediate decision on how the agency would proceed.   ``We have received Judge Miller's decision and at this time weare reviewing it in detail. Once we have completed our review wewill determine what our action will be,'' Schwartz said.   McRae's reinstatement is retroactive to Nov. 29, 1989, the datehe appealed his firing.   At hearings held two weeks ago in Rock Island, McRae said hecomplained and went over aviation chief Neil Pobanz's head afterPobanz repeatedly ignored pilots' complaints about poor aircraftmaintenance and unsafe practices.   McRae was hired as a pilot for the arsenal in 1982. He was firedNov. 17, 1989, more than two years after he reported mishandling ofdangerous chemicals and explosives, among other flight-safetyviolations.   A month after he made his complaints in September 1987, McRaewas grounded by Pobanz.   Acting on McRae's tip, Army investigators found assortedviolations, including failure to report aircraft mishaps,transportation of unauthorized personnel, failure to notify theairport of hazardous cargo and falsification of officials documents.</TEXT></DOC>
