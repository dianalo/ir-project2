With an eye to concluding their work for the year byThanksgiving, House and Senate negotiators yesterday put thefinal touches on an anti-crime bill, which is one of twomeasures that President Bush specifically challenged thelawmakers to complete in 1991. The second bill, which wouldauthorize billions of dollars for surface-transportationprograms over the next six years, was still under discussion.</LP><TEXT>   Also in progress were two other pieces of mustlegislation. These would overhaul the banking laws andauthorize more funds to pay for the bailout of insolventthrift institutions.   House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) called the list ofmandatory bills &quot;admittedly ambitious,&quot; but he expressedoptimism that they could be done on time.   Even if these goals were met, however, lawmakers said thatthey still would have a lot to do next year. Democrats haveput off until then their plan to cut taxes for the middleclass. And Republican legislators appear to be stymied intheir effort to pass their own tax-cut package designed tospur economic growth.   The delay is largely due to resistance from PresidentBush, who wants to wait. But should he change his mind,Congress might find it has no choice but to return inDecember to hammer out an economic-relief plan.   Leaders of both parties agree that the law that underpinsalmost all fiscal policy -- the 1990 deficit-reductioncompromise -- is likely to be altered next year. Over theweekend, Mr. Foley and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole(R., Kan.) acknowledged that lawmakers likely will siphoninto other uses a sizable portion of the militaryexpenditures foreseen in the budget pact.   Speaker Foley told reporters at a breakfast meeting onSaturday that he favors shifting funds to domestic programsfrom the military. And yesterday on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet thePress,&quot; Mr. Dole said that he would use some military savingsfor tax relief for middle-income Americans and some forreducing the budget deficit.   In the meantime, Congress churned out routine legislation.The Senate passed and sent to President Bush a $271 billionmilitary spending bill for the current fiscal year. Congressearlier had passed a separate bill authorizing the ways inwhich much of that money should be spent.   The spending bill diminished the size of the B-2 bomberprogram. Only one of the stealth bombers would be added nextyear. Production of the F-117 stealth fighter also would behalted. Spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative, or&quot;Star Wars,&quot; was increased to more than $4 billion to helpdevelop a system that could stop nuclear missiles outside theEarth's atmosphere.   In the crime package, negotiators last night agreed toadopt the Senate-passed version of the so-called Brady bill-- named after former White House spokesman James Brady --which would impose a five-day waiting period on handgunpurchases. They also consented to apply the death penalty tomore than 50 federal crimes, including terrorism, hijackingand political assassinations.   The $3.2 billion crime legislation would limit appeals byinmates of their convictions and sentences, though not by asmuch as President Bush sought. It also would give lawenforcement officers greater latitude to use evidenceobtained by questionable means and create a police corps, akind of Reserve Officers' Training Corps for police.   Republicans objected to various parts of the final crimebill, but Democrats were betting that neither they norPresident Bush would block a bill that purports to get toughon crime.   Elsewhere, House and Senate negotiators made headway onthe $151 billion surface-transportation bill. They agreed toextend through fiscal 1999 half of a nickel-a-gallonmotor-fuels tax that is scheduled to lapse in fiscal 1996.They also agreed to consolidate the many highway programsinto just a few. Negotiators were discussing which individualconstruction projects to include in the bill, and how muchflexibility to give the states and localities to transferhighway funds into mass-transit programs.   In separate legislation, lawmakers were moving to delaycontroversial regulations that would restrict ways states canget federal matching funds for the Medicaid health programfor the poor. States maintain that their budgets would bedevastated by the rule, which, starting next year, wouldlargely prohibit them from receiving federal matching moneyfor Medicaid funds they raise from taxes on health-careproviders.   In addition, Congress is expected to supplement an earlierbill that extended benefits for the long-term unemployed. Thenew measure would make sure that all workers who haveexhausted state benefits since March would get an additional13 or 20 weeks of federal unemployment compensation.</TEXT></DOC>
