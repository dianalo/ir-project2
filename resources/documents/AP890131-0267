SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The population boom appears headed for a bustin the United States, with Census Bureau experts projecting Tuesdaythat the number of Americans will stop growing in 50 years and thenbegin to shrink.   The prime reason: A decline in births as the post-World War IIBaby Boom matures.   The aging of that giant generation means that never again willAmerica have as many women in the prime childbearing ages of 18 to34 as it now does, census demographer Gregory Spencer said.   ``After 1995 the population may grow more slowly than ever before_ more slowly than even during the Great Depression of the 1930s,''Spencer said.   His study estimated that the nation's population could risegradually from the current 247 million to a peak of nearly 302million by the year 2038 and then begin to decline.   That is the middle projection of a series of some 30 differentpossibilities included in the study.   The lowest growth estimate would have the population peak at264.5 million in the year 2020 before starting to decline, while thehigh-growth scenario would have the nation at 501 million and stillgrowing in 2080.   While wary of calling one series ``most likely,'' Spencer saidthat in general, when people ask what the population will be like inthe future, he gives them the middle series of projections.   The bureau compiles 30 sets of estimates, however, in an attemptto account for varying possibilities in birth rates, death rates,differences between races and ethnic groups, immigration and soforth.   According to the middle series, the U.S. population will climbfor 50 years, peaking in 2038, and then begin a modest decline.   During that coming half-century the overall increase is expectedto total about 56 million, nearly the same amount the U.S. grewduring the last 25 years.   After that peak, shrinkage should occur, although it will be``really quite modest,'' Spencer said, with the population fallingby only about 10 million over the subsequent 42 years.   ``So, obviously, it wouldn't take very much to make this nothappen,'' he added.   The projection for slower growth, followed by decline, stems fromthe fact that ``we have had fertility in this country belowreplacement level since the mid-1970s,'' Spencer said.   Currently each women has a lifetime average of about 1.8 births,while it takes 2.1 to keep population stable.   ``The main thing keeping the number of births up is the sheerenormous number of women of childbearing age,'' Spencer said.   But those Baby Boomers are now heading into older age groups thattend to have fewer children, while a much smaller group of youngwomen is coming along into the childbearing ages.   Already the number of women aged 18 to 34 has begun to decline,the study said. Peaking at 35.3 million in 1985 it slipped to 35.2million by 1987 and is expected to drop to 34.7 million by 1990 andby 2080 to be below 30 million.   Spencer noted that the population projections assume thatfertility will become slightly higher in the next few years.   This is based on the expectation that many women who havepostponed families while attending school and launching careers willdecide to have children before they become too old to reproduce.   The report also says the nation's elderly population, which hasattracted so much attention in recent years, is expected to growmore slowly after the mid-1990s, and then accelerate again after2010.   That slowing is expected because the small generation born in theDepression and war years of the 1930s and 1940s will be moving intothis age group.   But once the postwar Baby Boom reaches that plateau, the elderlysegment will resume the rapid growth it has seen in recent years.   Other findings of the new report include:   _The share of the population under age 35 may never again be aslarge as it is now _ 55 percent. That percentage is expected to dropto 48 percent in 2000, 46 percent in 2010 and 41 percent in 2030.   _The white population may begin to decline in 40 years while theblack and other races population is expected to continue increasing.   _By the year 2030, the population could include as many as 32million immigrants who entered the country after 1986, and theirdescendants _ 12 percent of the population.   Here is a rundown of the projected U.S. population in comingyears, based on the middle set of estimates. The Census Bureauestimated the U.S. population at 246,879,546 as of Jan. 1 of thisyear.</TEXT><TEXT>   Year Projection1990 250,410,0001995 260,138,0002000 268,266,0002005 275,604,0002010 282,575,0002015 288,997,0002020 294,364,0002025 298,252,0002030 300,629,0002035 301,725,0002038 301,881,0002040 301,807,0002045 301,100,0002050 299,849,0002055 298,369,0002060 296,963,0002065 295,744,0002070 294,642,0002075 293,500,0002080 292,235,000</TEXT></DOC>
