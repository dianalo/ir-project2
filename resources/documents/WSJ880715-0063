Traders said the rollover of July options expiring today into August contracts set off buy programs late in the day.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.25 points to close at 2113.62, after having hugged Wednesday's closing level of 2104.37 for most of the day. The broader market moved along with the Dow Jones industrials. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index closed 0.94 point ahead at 270.26, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.49 point to 152.76.    Higher oil prices, which boosted some oil issues, and strong earnings reports in selected stocks also contributed to the market's rise. But most investors waited out the trading session, in anticipation of today's report on the U.S. trade deficit for May.    Advancers ended ahead of decliners, 779 to 643, with 538 issues unchanged.    Volume on the Big Board totaled 172.4 million shares, but more than 36 million of those shares were traded to capture their dividends. Traders said that excluding dividend-related trading and futures-related program trading, very few shares changed hands.    The market took yesterday's prime rate increase in stride. Some traders said the move was already largely accounted for because of the recent rise in short-term interest rates. But Philip Puccio, manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read, said investors would have sold on the news if it had been a normal trading day.    He cited the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index, which investors have watched recently as a measure of inflationary pressures. The index was up nearly four points yesterday. Mr. Puccio said that, given the rise in commodity futures and the prime rate boost, &quot;the market would have been down if it had been a normal day with institutions involved.&quot; But he said institutions stayed out of the market for most of the day.    &quot;Yesterday and today were more technical than news driven&quot; because of the unwinding of July options, he said.    A. Marshall Acuff Jr., portfolio strategist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham, said investors seem to be in a state of paralysis.    &quot;We need something exceptional to come along and move this market,&quot; he said, noting that strong second-quarter earnings don't seem to be enough.    Mr. Acuff said that Friday's May trade deficit number could help if it is lower than expected. He said the stock market's early summer rally stalled largely because a rising dollar failed to attract the foreign investment that people had hoped for.    &quot;Maybe the dollar rose too fast, and foreigners suspect that it won't stay up,&quot; Mr. Acuff said. He added that evidence that the U.S. trade deficit is improving would give needed confidence to investors here and abroad.    Preferred shares of Federal Home Loan Mortgage jumped 32 3/4 to 132 3/4, making it the Big Board's biggest percentage gainer. The surge followed Wednesday's news that the public would be allowed to trade the stock. Until now, only thrifts could own the shares. In recent weeks, the preferred had soared on anticipation that the ownership curbs would be lifted.    The stocks of some thrifts that hold the preferred also climbed, as they stand to reap big profits if they sell their Freddie Mac holdings. Virginia Beach Federal Savings andamp; Loan of Hopewell, Va., rose 7/8 to 5 7/8 in OTC trading; Great American First Savings Bank, San Diego, one of the largest holders, gained 5/8 to 11 7/8 on the Big Board. Citicorp, which owns the preferred through four thrift units, gained 1/2 to 24 1/4.    Millipore rose 1 3/8 to 38 5/8 on volume of 625,000 shares. The company was added to Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index yesterday. Another issue added to the index, Worthington Industries, rose 1 1/8 to 24 3/8 in over-the-counter trading.    Zenith dropped 2 1/2 to 25 1/2 after a newspaper report that the company had rejected bids for its consumer electronics business from various South Korean and European companies. The company declined to comment on the article but told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it is continuing discussions on &quot;potential activities&quot; of the business with interested parties.    Squibb rose 2 5/8 to 67 7/8. The rise was linked to a published study praising the company's drug, Capoten.    Diebold fell 1 3/4 to 38 1/4. Kidder Peabody cut its rating on the stock and lowered earnings estimates for the company.    First Chicago rose 1 1/2 to 34 1/8. PaineWebber raised its 1988 and 1989 earnings estimates for the company. The revised estimate was in response to the strong second-quarter earnings reported Wednesday by the company.    Corporate earnings reports have begun to move selected issues. Motorola tumbled 1 5/8 to 50 5/8 on volume of about 1.3 million shares. Its second-quarter net income came in at the low end of analysts' expectations. The company reported earnings of 93 cents a share, up from 62 cents a year ago.    Vista Chemical advanced 2 1/4 to 60 after it said it expects to report a sharp improvement in its fiscal third-quarter earnings from the year-earlier 82 cents a share.    Strong second-quarter earnings also moved Owens-Corning Fiberglas ahead 1 3/4 to 24. The company said it earned $1.27 a share in the quarter, up from 46 cents a year earlier.    Graco rose 1 5/8 to 34 1/2 after it reported net income of 61 cents a share for the second quarter, up from 33 cents a year ago.    Continental Information Systems plunged 1 1/2 to 4 1/2 on volume of more than 1.4 million shares. The company said it had a $7.5 million loss in its first quarter ended May 31, compared with net income of $2.9 million in the year-ago quarter.    A weak report also sent DeSoto down 1 1/2 to 38 1/4. The company said it earned $1.04 a share in the quarter, down from $1.73 a year earlier.    The American Stock Exchange Index rose 0.48 to 308.14. Amex volume totaled 9,279,000 shares, up from 8,307,000 Wednesday. There were 277 issues advancing, 274 declining and 295 unchanged.    Iverson Technology dropped 1 3/8 to 13. Raymond James cut its rating on the stock and lowered its 1988 and 1989 earnings estimates for the company.    Dataproducts advanced 3/4 to 10 3/4. The company reported net income of two cents a share for its first quarter ended June 25, the same as a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
