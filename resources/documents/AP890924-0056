The upheaval in the Soviet bloc grabbed center stage as theannual meetings of the 152-nation International Monetary Fund andthe World Bank got underway. The more traditional global economicissues, such as huge trade imbalances and Third World debtproblems, also were addressed.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the events occurring inthe Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were changing the world andwere ``the most significant event perhaps since the end of WorldWar II.''   Brady and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson toldreporters that the meetings of the so-called Group of Seven _ theUnited States, Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy andCanada _ had been dominated by the discussions concerning EasternEurope.   ``What is happening in Poland and Hungary is of historic andmomentous importance and the major nations of the West must beprepared to do all we can to help them change their economies, justas they are changing their politics, from Communism to a democraticsystem,'' Lawson said.   Both Poland and Hungary are members of the IMF and World Bank,making them eligible for financial assistance. Just last week theSoviet Union said it, too, intended to apply for membership in thetwo international lending organizations.   In other remarks Sunday before the IMF policy-making interimcommittee, Brady said that the United States still remains opposedto an increase in the resources of the IMF, despite a plea from IMFManaging Director Michel Camdessus that IMF lending resources needto be doubled from $120 billion currently to $240 billion to meetgrowing needs of impoverished Third World nations.   ``A fully persuasive case has not been made that there is apressing need for additional resources at this time,'' Brady said.But he added that the administration was still reviewing theproposal and would not make a final determination until the end ofthe year.   Because of the U.S. share of voting rights in the IMF, anyproposal to boost IMF resources would have to have the backing ofthe United States.   On the issue of Third World debt, Brady said that the debtreduction initiative he unveiled last March was a significant stepforward in dealing with a ``growing sense of helplessness'' in theglobal debt crisis but he cautioned against unreasonableexpectations.   ``Excessive expectations can only promote delays, increase therisk of breakdown in negotiations and ultimately raise the economiccosts both to the banks and debtor countries,'' he said.   The Bush administration and other governments have said there isa need for the two international lending organizations to redefinetheir roles to meet changing needs. Many see helping Communistcountries enter the global economy as a primary job for the twoorganizations in the next decade.   Poland became the first government in the East bloc not led bythe Communists earlier this month and the country is currentlynegotiating with the IMF for assistance.   The new Polish government is trying to combat food shortages andsoaring inflation while replacing the state-run economy with a moremarket-based system.   The discussions at the IMF-World Bank meetings follow up onpledges of increased aid made by the G-7 countries at their annualeconomic summit in Paris, a meeting President Bush attended aftermaking stops in both Poland and Hungary.   Brady said that no country made any specific further commitmentsto assistance during the weekend discussions, but the final G-7communique did pledge ``strong support'' for the reform efforts,including rescheduling under more favorable terms for the part ofPoland's $42 billion in debt being held by the United States andother governments.   Finance ministers dodged questions Sunday about how they plannedto back up their pledge made in the G-7 communique issued lateSaturday to keep the dollar from rising. Brady and the otherfinance ministers promised joint action to combat a further rise inthe dollar's value, saying such an event could jeopardize effortsto narrow the huge U.S. trade deficit.   Brady on Sunday said the United States was doing its part tocorrect its trade problems by reducing the U.S. federal budgetdeficit, an action U.S. allies have long called for as a way ofreducing America's need for foreign financing.   He called on countries running trade surpluses, such as Japanand West Germany, to do more to boost domestic growth and thusprovide a larger market for sales of exports from the United Statesand other countries.   ``The United States cannot solve the world's problems alone,''Brady said. ``The surplus countries must also implement policies tosustain domestic growth and open their economies.''   In its annual world economic outlook, the IMF projected Sundaythat the deficit in the broadest measure of U.S. trade, the currentaccount, would total $125.1 billion this year, only a slightimprovement from the 1988 level, but would widen sharply to $138.7billion in 1990.   If this occurs, it would be a setback to Bush administrationhopes for continued improvement in trade as a way of keeping thedomestic economy growing.</TEXT></DOC>
