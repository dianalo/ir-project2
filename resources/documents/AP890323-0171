He said he would urge Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader ofthe conservative Likud bloc, to accept the peace plan before thepremier visits the United States next month. Peres is financeminister in the ``national unity'' coalition of Likud and hiscenter-left party.   Newspaper reports said the plan calls for a Palestinian state inall but name, demilitarized and in confederation with Jordan andIsrael. Peres denied recommending a separate state in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured in the 1967 war.   Arab hospital officials said soldiers in the occupied territoriesshot the boy and wounded 18 other Palestinians. At least 405Palestinians have been killed since an uprising began in the WestBank and Gaza more than 15 months ago, and 18 Israelis also havebeen slain.   The army denied any troopers were in the West Bank village at thetime, but said it was investigating a report that civilian Israelisin the area responded with gunfire when their car was stoned. Aspokesman said he had reports of six gunshot wounds.   Also Wednesday, Labor and its rival, the right-wing Likud blocled by Shamir, agreed to allocate $19.4 million to fund Jewishsettlements in the occupied territories.   Media reports said Likud demanded almost twice that sum, butPeres' Finance Ministry refused.   Haaretz, a Hebrew-language daily, said the Peres peace plan callsfor a one-year truce in the occupied lands, including a moratoriumon the uprising.   ``In essence, we are talking about abandoning our control of theterritories, of Judea and Samaria. It's clear it would be handedover to some form of Arab sovereignty,'' said Ephraim Sneh, a LaborParty member who worked on the plan, using the biblical names forthe West Bank.   Sneh said details have yet to be worked out but the plan has twostages, with the problems of sovereignty and the link to Jordan tobe addressed in the second stage.   On television Thursday, Peres said ``we are ready for territorialcompromise'' but vigorously denied calling for a Palestinian state,a risky political concept in Israel, and gave no details.   ``I have not proposed a Palestinian state,'' he said. ``I haveruled out the Palestinian state. I will present my plan to Mr.Shamir.''   He used the phrases ``Palestinian entity'' and ``confederation,according to the example of Benelux'' in describing his plan.   The Haaretz report said Peres calls the plan ``the Beneluxmodel,'' a reference to the close cooperation between Belgium, theNetherlands and Luxembourg.   It said the Peres plan would create a three-state federationinvolving Israel, Jordan and a Palestinian ``entity'' that would bea nation in all ways except that it would have no army.   Israeli troops would withdraw, but maintain a presence along thestrategic Jordan River valley.   After an informal truce began, direct talks between Israel and aPalestinian delegation elected from the occupied territories wouldopen in Geneva under international auspices.   Representatives of the ``Palestinian diaspora,'' presumably thePalestine Liberation Organization, would be brought in at a laterstage, Haaretz said.   Peres said on television Thursday: ``The PLO has changed. Youcan't deny it.''   Israel still regards the PLO as a terrorist organization andrefuses to deal with it, but the United States began contacts inDecember, after Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism andrecognized Israel's right to exist. The second formal meeting washeld Wednesday.   Avraham Burg, a Labor Party dove, said the plan published inHaaretz was a rough version of a proposal that has been developedfurther. ``It's in the right general direction,'' he said of thenewspaper report.   Soldiers shot six Palestinians Thursday in the Gaza Strip andwounded 12 in the West Bank, hospital officials said.   At Ousarin village, near Nablus in the West Bank, 14-year-oldMaher Shakid Said was shot in the chest and killed, according toofficials of Ittihad Hospital in Nablus.   A military court sentenced four Palestinian guerrillas to lifeimprisonment Thursday for trying to enter Israel from Lebanon lastyear. The Palestinians confessed to the attempt and said theybelonged to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, aradical Syrian-based faction of the PLO.</TEXT></DOC>
