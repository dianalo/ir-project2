Analysts predicted Monday that interest rates will hold steadybecause the central bank is satisfied it has done all it needs tokeep the country out of an economic slump.   Those economists suggested that comments by Budget DirectorRichard Darman might actually backfire and make the central bankless inclined to ease credit conditions for fear of appearing to bowto political pressure.   Darman complained that the central bank was keeping interestrates too high and would shoulder the blame if the country fallsinto a recession.   ``If we do have a recession, I think it will be because theyerred on the side of caution'' in fighting inflation by keepinginterest rates too high, Darman said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet thePress.''   The White House tried to soften the sting from Darman's messageby praising the Fed on Monday for generally doing a ``good job'' butBush today generally endorsed the comments during a morning pressconference.   Bush praised Darman for expressing his views, which he called``very balanced.''   ``I feel very comfortable with his (Darman's) sallying forth,''Bush said. ``I think I have said the same things in the past.''   Bush said he did not know of any president who had ever come outagainst lower interest rates, but he stopped short of saying that hebelieved that if a recession did occur, it would be the fault of thecentral bank.   Private economists were surprised by the timing of Darman'scriticism, given recent economic statistics such as a drop in thejobless rate in August that suggest the economy isn't as sluggish aspreviously feared.   ``There is virtually no chance that we will have a recession thisyear. So why stir up this fuss and get financial markets unsettledwhen you don't have to?'' asked Michael Evans, head of a Washingtonforecasting company.   But other economists said they believed Darman was positioningthe Fed to take the blame if the economy does weaken and the countryends up in a recession right before next year's congressionalelections.   ``This is a classic situation of setting up the Fed to be thefall guy if something goes wrong,'' said Robert Dederick, chiefeconomist at Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.   Dederick and other economists said it was unlikely that Darman'sremarks would have any impact on upcoming Fed decisions. Top Fedpolicymakers will meet again in Washington on Aug. 22.   Many economists said they expected the central bank to holdinterest rates steady and not ease further given recent signs thatcertain key sectors, such as consumer spending, are rebounding.   ``So long as the economy is OK, there is no reason for the Fed toease any more,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   From March 1988 through March 1989, the Federal Reserve pushedshort-term interest rates higher in an anti-inflation campaign. TheFed reversed course in June and has made three modest moves to lowerinterest rates by making more money available to the banking system.   Banks have been able to cut their prime lending rate since earlyJune by a full percentage point to 10.5 percent. Home mortgage rateshave declined as well, dropping below 10 percent to stand at 9.96percent for fixed-rate loans.   Sinai said he believed mortgage rates have hit their low for theyear and may even climb by about one-fourth percentage point incoming weeks as financial markets realize that the central bank hasdecided to hold off on further easing moves.   Paul Getman, senior economist at the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd,Pa., consulting company, said the Fed was correct to pause beforedriving interest rates any lower.   He said if economic activity turns out to be stronger in thesecond half of the year than forecast, the Fed would run the risk oftriggering higher inflation next year by loosening credit conditionstoo rapidly.</TEXT></DOC>
