Sun Microsystems Inc., of Mountain View, Calif., isexpected to unveil on Tuesday a new low-cost version of itspopular Sparcstation that puts it in the price range of manypersonal computers. And Tokyo's Toshiba Corp., in a bid toexpand its share of the rapidly growing market forworkstations, said it would begin selling the world's firstportable workstation.</LP><TEXT>   Sun's machine, expected to cost just under $5,000, is justthe latest in a technological leapfrogging game by computermakers; rivals say they will soon best Sun's machine withstill faster, cheaper workstations.   Toshiba's announcement comes a month after Japanese rivalSony Corp. announced it would sell a portable workstation bylate July. Toshiba said it hopes to begin production of itsnew machine, based on Sun's Sparc chip, in the U.S. by theend of the year, officials said at a Tokyo news conference.It is scheduled to go on sale in Japan in mid-July.   Called the Sparc LT model, it is the latest demonstrationof Toshiba's ability to pack more and more computing powerinto smaller and smaller machines. The company, long a minorplayer in computer sales, has become a world leader in laptoppersonal computers in the past three years. The newworkstation &quot;is going to extend the market because you'regoing to be able to do more things with it,&quot; said Peter G.Wolff, a technology analyst with Kidder Peabody's Tokyooffice. &quot;It's an innovative step.&quot;   But many computer makers say the market for laptopworkstations is limited. Since the main users of workstationsare scientists and engineers, who typically work withequipment that isn't readily movable, the advantages ofportability aren't as clear-cut as they are forpersonal-computer users.   In addition, workstations usually gain much of theirusefulness from being hooked up to one another and to othercomputers. As a result, users aren't very likely to use themat home or on the road, as many business executives do withportable personal computers.   Workstations, which combine high speed with flashygraphics and usually run the Unix operating system, untilrecently have been high-priced desktop machines selling for$20,000 and up. But prices have fallen steeply since lastyear as makers worked toward the high end of thepersonal-computer market.   &quot;The technology wars are really heating up and thetechnology price curve is getting steeper,&quot; said John Hime,vice president of systems products marketing at MIPS ComputerSystems Inc. &quot;Sun's got a great machine, but other companieslike MIPS are introducing technology just as fast, if notfaster.&quot;   The new Sun machine, called the Sparcstation SLC, will runat 12.5 million operations per second, analysts familiar withthe machine say. The $5,000 price tag brings the computerwell into the price range of high-end personal computers,which don't run as fast and have poorer graphics. Sun'scheapest machine now is the $8,995 Sparcstation 1-Plus.   Still, the Sun machine may lack important components. TheSLC will be a stripped-down version of Sun's Sparcstationbuilt into a 17-inch monochrome monitor with no disk driveand no ability to be expanded with add-in cards. So it willhave to be tied into a network of other computers to beuseful.   What's more, any low-priced workstation faces a basichurdle: Most of the software programs that businesses use arewritten to run on Microsoft Corp.'s MSDOS operating system,not on the Unix operating system used by Sun.   Sun's rivals are critical of the new product. &quot;I don'tthink they'll have the performance in the box to make up forall the things the box doesn't have,&quot; said Donald Gaubatz,group manager for workstations at Digital Equipment Corp.Digital began selling last year a $5,950 workstation that isonly slightly slower than the Sparcstation, he said, addingthat the company plans to keep the price competitively low.   MIPS, likewise, said it plans price cuts and performanceimprovements that will bring its machines in line with Sun'sby this summer. Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to sell later thisyear a low-end workstation based on Motorola Inc.'s new 68040microprocessor chip. Hewlett now has the cheapestworkstation, the $3,990 DN 2500, running at about 40% thespeed of the new Sun machine, said Mark Tolliver, Hewlett'sworkstation-marketing manager. &quot;We have no intention ofsurrendering that position,&quot; he said.   The new Toshiba machine, which weighs 17.7 pounds, has afold-up screen. Company officials said it weighs a third asmuch as the basic Sun model sold in Japan, and takes up halfthe space. It has a processing speed of 13.2 mips and willsell in Japan for about two million yen (about $12,600).Toshiba expects to sell about 3,000 of the machines in Japanthis year and about 14,000 next year.   But, in addition to concerns about the practicality of alaptop workstation, the Sparc LT has some technologicalconstraints that may limit its use. It currently has only abuilt-in black and white screen. Color, often a crucialfeature for the scientists and engineers who are the mainworkstation users, won't be available for more than twoyears. Unlike battery-operable laptop computers, the machinehas to be plugged in.   Toshiba's market projections for laptops are &quot;rubbish,&quot;said Vicky Brown of International Data Corp. of Framington,Mass. &quot;Can you see someone carrying 18 pounds on the bullettrain? We're far away from the point where we're going tohave a big market for laptop workstations.&quot;   Digital's Mr. Gaubatz agrees. Users of Unix workstationsdepend heavily on networks that tie them together with othermachines, he said. &quot;There will be some people who would finda reason to buy it,&quot; he said. But most users &quot;are just toointimately connected to their network. You don't have that ifyou have the thing on your lap.&quot;   But Toshiba officials say that, with desk space morecramped in Japan than in the U.S., such smaller machines mayhave greater appeal in their home market. And they say theyare simplifying the software to try and broaden the base oftraditional workstation users.   Toshiba has been selling Sun workstations in Japan since1986, and a year ago signed an agreement with Sun allowing itto develop and manufacture machines based on the Sun system.&quot;Sun welcomes the Sparc LT,&quot; said Scott McNealy, Sun'schairman, in a statement videotaped for yesterday's pressconference. &quot;This complementary product will expand themarket for Sparc workstations and servers, just as the PCmarket was enhanced by the arrival of laptops.&quot;   The Japanese, who still have only a tiny share of theworld computer market, have been jumping into the $6 billionworkstation market. Sony is Japan's leader with its Newsworkstation, which it started selling in 1987, and exportingthe following year.   ---   Laurence Hooper contributed to this story.</TEXT></DOC>
