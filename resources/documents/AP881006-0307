(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A special committee of HospitalCorporation of America's board of directors rejected on Thursday a$3.3 billion leveraged buyout proposal from a management group ledby Chairman Thomas F. Frist.   The committee decided the offer of $47 cash per share from thegroup was not ``in the best interest of the HCA shareholders,''according to an HCA news release.   ``The committee reconfirmed that it has not made any decision tosell the company,'' the statement said. ``The committee is preparedto consider any proposal which management or others may choose tomake.''   Frist, an unnamed group of HCA managers and ``certain thirdparties'' offered to buy the company's 70.6 million outstandingshares in mid-September.   In a leveraged buyout, an purchaser uses mostly borrowed moneyto buy a company and repays it through cash flow or asset sales.   HCA stock rose $1.62{ to $43.75 a share Thursday on the New YorkStock Exchange.   HCA, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide,making it one of the world's biggest hospital chains, establishedthe special committee to review the proposal.   The committee said the decision to reject the proposal fromFrist's group was made on the advice of its independent financialadvisor, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Inc.   The company reported in July that its profits for the quarterending June 30 increased by 15 percent, partly because of increasedinpatient and outpatient revenue.   HCA sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over one yearago to a new employee-owned company, HealthTrust Inc.   Frist was unavailable for comment Thursday, and HCA spokesmanDavid McFadden would not comment on the committee's action.</TEXT></DOC>
