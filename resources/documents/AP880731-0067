Shultz sets outMonday on a 10-day visit to nine Latin American countries,intending to discuss ways of bringing new pressure to bear onNicaragua's leftist government and to call attention to democraticgains elsewhere in the hemisphere.   The first stop is Guatemala, where Shultz will meet with theforeign ministers of four Central American countries in an attemptto come up with a common strategy for exerting diplomatic pressureon Nicaragua to establish democracy.   Shultz on Sunday said that a statement which he said was draftedmostly by the foreign ministers of Guatemala, El Salvador, CostaRica and Honduras is still open to discussion.   ``We're not trying to ram anything down anyone's throat. Havingdrafted it, they are not so sure they want to issue it,'' Shultzsaid on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''   A senior administration official, who briefed reporters onFriday, said it was unclear whether the Guatemala meeting willresult in a joint statement of principles designed to prodNicaragua into complying with its stated commitment to move towarddemocracy.   The official, who insisted on anonymity, said a consensus on acommon policy toward Nicaragua has been difficult to reach.   The special U.S. envoy to Central America, Morris Busby, hasbeen consulting on that issue with officials from the four CentralAmerican democracies.   In Managua on Sunday, Nicarguan President Daniel Ortega urgedthe four countries to reject any U.S. attempt to condemn or isolatehis country.   He said the United States is ``trying to escalate the war ...with consequences for all the Central American countries, not justfor Nicaragua.''   Ortega told reporters he hoped ``the Central Americangovernments will respond with dignity and firmness and reject theproposal of the United States.''   Meanwhile, a Guatemalan legislator accused the State Departmentof trying to pressure the four countries into signing a virtual``declaration of war'' against Nicaragua.   The legislator, Edmund Mulet Lesiur, representing a politicalparty known as the Union of the National Center, said PresidentVinicio Cerzo rejected a demand by Busby to abandon Guatemala'spolicy of ``active neutrality'' by agreeing to the document.   Mulet said Honduras and El Salvador had agreed to sign it, whileGuatemala and Costa Rica turned it down.   The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City issued a statement Sundaycategorically denying Mulet's statements, made in an interview witha Guatemala City newspaper.   ``The United States has not `pressured' Guatemala or any othercountry. The United States has not asked Guatemala to abandon`active neutrality,''' the embassy said.   A fragile cease-fire remains in place in Nicaragua but there hasbeen no progress on a final settlement between the Sandinistas andthe Contra rebels. The impasse has produced calls by conservativemembers of Congress for a renewal of military aid to the rebels,   In public statements this past week, rebel leaders havemaintained that the truce has helped the Sandinistas by enablingthem to strengthen their overall military position at a time whenthe Contras have been denied lethal aid from the United States.   The administration has contended that the Sandinistas also havestepped up internal repression since the truce went into effectfour months ago.   In a commentary this past week in The New York Times, AssistantSecretary of State Elliott Abrams said the situation in Nicaraguadeteriorated after Congress rejected a Contra military aid requestin February.   ``Since then, the predictable has happened: The communists haveincreased repression and mocked the promises they made. And whynot, when our military support for the fighters has been haltedwhile Soviet arms deliveries continue?''   Much of Shultz's trip will be devoted to highlighting thedemocratic trend in the hemisphere. All of the nations on hisitinerary have elected governments and all, with the exception ofCosta Rica, became democratic over the past nine years.   After Guatemala, Shultz will travel to Argentina, Uruguay,Brazil and Bolivia before a return trip, lasting 24 hours, toCentral America on Aug. 8 for talks in Costa Rica, El Salvador andHonduras.   The trip ends on Aug. 10 when Shultz will attend the inauguralceremony of Ecuadoran President-elect Rodrigo Borja. While inQuito, Shultz also will confer with President Jaime Lucinchi ofVenezuela and President Virgilio Barco of Colombia.   Shultz has visited each country on his schedule before exceptBolivia, where officials give President Victor Paz Estenssoro highmarks for revitalizing the economy and moving decisively againstdrug smugglers. In La Paz, Shultz will deliver a speech on the drugissue.   Abrams believes the focus on administration setbacks inNicaragua and Panama have deflected attention from the democraticprogress made elsewhere in Latin America.   In his Times' commentary, Abrams wrote that throughout the 7{years of the Reagan presidency, no Latin American democracy hasbeen replaced by a dictatorship.   Pronouncing Reagan's policy an ``extraordinary success,'' Abramssaid that the United States has helped promote ``the greatestexpansion of democracy in Latin history.''</TEXT></DOC>
