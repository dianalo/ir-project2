The more than $2 billion savings from the costly stationwould be redistributed to help finance increases elsewhere inspace programs and the National Science Foundation, as wellas an expanded $6.6 billion budget for the EnvironmentalProtection Agency.</LP><TEXT>   The National Science Foundation would receive an estimated$2.7 billion, including $1.96 billion for research activitiesor nearly 16% more than the current fiscal year ending Sept.30. Within the $13.65 billion allocated to the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration, lawmakers approved theadministration's full requests for the ambitious EarthObserving System satellite program and AXAF X-ray telescope.   Separately, in the Energy Department, magnetic fusionresearch funds would grow 24% to $337.1 million. And evenafter the cuts imposed yesterday, funding for the massivesuper collider atom-smasher would increase almost two-thirdsto $433.7 million.   Despite these adjustments, the defeat of the space stationrepresents a major blow to NASA and its internationalpartners. The move also reflects the new politics of spendingcaps imposed in last fall's deficit-reduction agreement.Domestic appropriations are held to 5% growth in the fiscalyear beginning Oct. 1, and the multibillion dollar stationbecame more vulnerable as lawmakers sought money not only forcompeting science endeavors but for an amalgam of unrelatedhousing, veterans, and environmental programs funded underthe same bill.   Yesterday's meetings were behind closed doors, but thecrucial vote on the station was described as 6-3-withRepublicans and Democrats on both sides of the issue. Afteralready investing $4.85 billion in the project, NASA iscertain to fight back in the Senate. But the agency faces adifficult fight given the budget choices this year.   &quot;Station is out unless I get substantially more money,&quot;said Rep. Robert Traxler (D., Mich.), chairman of theappropriations subcommittee, following the vote. And thoughhe opposed the termination, House Science Committee ChairmanGeorge Brown said it would be difficult to overturn Mr.Traxler's position. &quot;He's made a decision that has a lot ofmerit and has a strategy to back it up,&quot; said the CaliforniaDemocrat.   The underlying bill funding NASA's budget provides almost$81 billion in new appropriations for fiscal 1992, including$24.4 billion for the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment. The panel approved $500 million for the new HOMEblock grant program to assist states and local governments inproviding shelter for low-income families. And though lessthan a quarter of his request, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp ispromised $200 million for his HOPE home-ownership initiative.   The super collider and magnetic fusion accounts are partof a smaller $21.5 billion measure funding not only theEnergy Department but also water projects built and operatedby the Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation. Thecorps and bureau budgets, totaling almost $4.5 billion,include no new construction starts, and lawmakers devotedthemselves instead to protecting more than $100 million forongoing projects not in the president's budget.   An estimated $237 million is provided for solar energy --more than 17% above the president's budget -- and $4.4billion is allocated to continue the costly cleanup ofnuclear weapon plants. Within atomic energy defenseactivities, about $637 million is expected to go to thecontroversial Rocky Flats plant in Colorado. The panel,however, attached language opposed by the departmentrequiring it to first seek the opinion of a panel of outsideexperts before disbursing those funds related to therecycling of plutonium for weapons at the facility.</TEXT></DOC>
