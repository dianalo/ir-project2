In written statements, Kemp pledged to work toward making homeownership possible for people in public housing, to press for urbanenterprise zones to encourage inner city development, and to seek anational housing policy that will make housing more affordable forpoor and young families.   His hearing was interrupted by six members of the Community forCreative Non-Violence, an advocate for the homeless, who shoutedaccusations that the nominee was partly responsible for thereduction in affordable housing available for low-income Americans.   Also facing questioning today was Mrs. Hills, who quickly wonapproval for the post of U.S. trade representative from the SenateFinance Committee on an 18-0 vote. ``You have done well and you haveanswered with more specifics than I have normally heard from aperson being confirmed,'' Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,told Mrs. Hills.   Former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, Bush's choice for defensesecretary, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday thatit is ``unrealistic'' to believe that the Star Wars missile defensesystem could protect all of America from nuclear attack.   Bush's selection to be his chief economic adviser, MichaelBoskin, told the Senate Banking Committee that savings can be foundin military and health care programs as the administration tries tohold next year's federal deficit to $100 billion.   And former Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr., R-N.M., testified to the SenateEnergy and Natural Resources Committee that if confirmed as Bush'sinterior secretary, he will try to leave the country's naturalresources in a ``better condition than we found them.''   Tower's comments on Star Wars represented a break from Reaganadministration descriptions of the program as capable of providingan extensive shield against nuclear attack.   ``I don't believe that we can devise (an) umbrella that canprotect the entire American population from nuclear incineration. Ithink that's unrealistic,'' Tower said.   Tower, who from 1981 to 1984 chaired the armed services panel,also told the committee that he would ``bend over backwards'' toavoid favoring his former military contractor associates, from whomhe earned $763,777 over the last three years.   He said he ended his relationship with the weapons industry onDec. 1, a day after learning he was under serious consideration forthe Pentgon post. He said he did not ``stand to gain from theprosperity of any former associate.''   But Tower was told by chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., that hissituation did pose problems because he had been involved with asmany as seven major military contractors.   Discussing the Defense Department's $300 billion budget, Towersaid ``nothing is sacred'' when it comes to saving money. He saidBush had yet to decide where any savings from the Pentagon's cofferswould come.   Boskin told the banking panel that Bush will reveal specificbudget proposals in an address to a joint session of Congress onFeb. 9.   Boskin, a Stanford University economics professor, is the creatorof Bush's flexible freeze plan, under which total federal spendingwould grow no faster than the inflation rate. Bush has claimed thatwith that constraint, the budget can be balanced by 1993 with no taxincreases, an assertion that critics claim would work only if theeconomy performs at unexpectedly good levels.   Bush has never stated precisely how he would keep spending incheck, and Boskin offered no new specifics to the senators.   ``If there are no new taxes, that means there will have to besome massive cuts in the federal budget,'' said Sen. Larry Pressler,R-S.D., who repeatedly asked Boskin to specify ``three or fourareas'' where spending reductions should be made.   Boskin, who emphasized that Bush has not made any final decisionson the budget, said he would personally favor reducing the growthrate of military spending and government-paid health benefits.   ``If I were looking for large savings, they would have to comefrom areas where there is large spending,'' Boskin said.   Lujan, Bush's choice to be interior secretary, told the energycommittee that he considers the job to be a ``stewardship,'' andsaid he would seek thousands of volunteers as helpers in thenational park and fish and wildlife systems.   He quoted the late President Roosevelt in saying, ``The countrywill not be a good place to live in unless it is a good place forall of us to live in.''   ``We want to be known as a team who passed on these nationaltreasures in better condition than we found them,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
