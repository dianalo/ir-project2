<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-0268 </DOCNO><TEXT>The relationship between an owner and a contractor is defined and governedby a variety of factors. The contractual agreement between the ownerand the contractor, the customs and practices of the parties, and federalstatutory and case law, may affect the rights and liabilities of theowner and the contractor in numerous ways. This is particularly truein the area of labor and employment law. This chapter does not attemptto address every labor and employment law issue which can arise betweenan owner and a contractor. Rather, it focuses on three aspects governedby federal law that are of great importance: the joint employer doctrinedeveloped under the National Labor Relations Act; the relations betweenowners and contractors set forth and mandated under Article IA(h) ofthe National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1984; and the enforcementpolicies directed at owners and contractors under the Federal Mine Safetyand Health Act of 1977. For purposes of the discussion and analysis herein,it is assumed that the contractors are bona fide independent partieswhich are not affiliated with the owner through common ownership or othersimilar relationship.</TEXT></DOC>
