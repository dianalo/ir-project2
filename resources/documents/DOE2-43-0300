<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0300 </DOCNO><TEXT>The present conference on active IR optics discusses topics in CO{sub2} laser technology development, novel system and component characteristics,and lidars and laser rangefinders. Attention is given to compact highpower transmitters for CO{sub 2} lasers, a miniature CO{sub 2} laserfor hand-held applications, nonlinear optical frequency-locking of aTEA-CO{sub 2} laser, and simultaneous gain and spontaneous emission noisemeasurements in RF-excited CO{sub 2} amplifying media. Also discussedare the transmission characteristics of a hollow core SiO{sub 2} waveguidein the 9-11 micron band, the theory of CO{sub 2} laser transmission throughcurved hollow dielectric waveguides, a CO{sub 2} laser radar for Dopplerimaging, and compact CO{sub 2} laser range finders for terrain-followingapplications.</TEXT></DOC>
