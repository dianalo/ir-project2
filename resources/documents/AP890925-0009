Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at handto create a giant political and economic machine that coulddominate Europe.   ``Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether itwill take 10, 15 or 20 years,'' says West German conservativelawmaker Eduard Lintner. ``We have the impression that things aremuch more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.''   The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East Germanleader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalistWest has revived international interest in the debate.   Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of Germanreunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush andsomething short of a categorical ``no'' from President Mikhail S.Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.   The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic.   ``If there were a free choice under the present circumstances inthe German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percentto 90 percent would vote for national reunification with theFederal Republic of Germany,'' added the 44-year-old Lintner in anAssociated Press interview.   The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but ithas not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the yearssince the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West atthe end of World War II.   Full national reunification would completey rework the postwarEuropean order mapped out by the conquering Allies. It is aprospect that creates unease in Britain and France, and in Polandin the East bloc.   London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out apossible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in Europe,Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary.   ``Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guaranteesfrom Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances,'' theTimes' futuristic view continued. ``West Germany withdraws fromNATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes forreunification and neutrality.''   That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosensits hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union,Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms.   The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and otherbarriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many,ominous.   As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even furtherto the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people _61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.   West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, anddespite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of manySoviet bloc neighbors.   A unified Germany could become the political focal point of acontinent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts ofthe Soviet bloc.   Older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator AdolfHitler's boasting that he had brought about ``the unity of theGerman nation.''   Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and EasternEurope at the French Institute of International Relations, says shebelieves that ``as far as public opinion there is new sort ofmistrust toward Germany.   ``This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France,'' sheadded.   Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines oftwo competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification wouldhave to come from Washington and Moscow.   During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said thatreunification is a ``matter for the Germans to decide.''   But he added: ``If that (reunification) was worked out betweenthe Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Westerninterests.''   For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a newsconference in Bonn in June, saying only, ``the situation in Europetoday was determined by historical realities.''   Outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have beensharply divided on the issue.   ``In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to begoverned by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,'' wrotecommentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent. ``The ColdWar was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the comingof freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which findsits echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.''   Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to theEast as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn'tnecessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a``hypothesis that cannot be excluded.''   As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunificationalmost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the countryin near-record numbers. More than 100,000 East Germans are expectedto resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in theCommunist nation's work force.   Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.   During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respectfor Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.   ``Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fireand water,'' Honecker added on the issue of reunification.   There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successorswill be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining thecapitalist West.   The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic earamong some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in thecountry that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.   ``After all, the abnormal situation of the German nationovershadows the whole of Polish-German relations,'' member ofParliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity dailynewspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.   The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearlyprophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German stategovernor who later went on to head the centrist Free DemocraticParty.   ``Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not todisturb her sleep,'' Maier predicted in 1955. ``The lioness willone day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.''   Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quipby Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: ``I loveGermany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.''</TEXT></DOC>
