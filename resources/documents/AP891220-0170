TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The army's tough measures of housedemolitions, deportations and school closures have failed to reduceprotests by Palestinians and at times have inflamed the two-yearuprising, according to a study published Wednesday.   The study, part of an annual assessment of Middle East militarydevelopments by Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for StrategicStudies, challenged often-stated army claims that strong reprisalsserved as a deterrent to unrest.   Also on Wednesday, a military court sentenced three Palestiniansto life in prison for an Oct. 30, 1988, firebomb attack on anIsraeli bus that killed a mother and her three children as well asa soldier who tried to rescue them. Soldiers tried to attack thethree defendants after the verdict and turned on reporters as theyleft the court.   Israel radio reported a Palestinian prisoner in the custody ofthe Shin Bet secret service was found dead Tuesday night in hiscell. Arab reporters identified him as Khaled Kamel Al-Sheikh Ali,27, of Gaza City, and said he was taken for questioning Dec. 7.   As a new step against the uprising, the army spokesman's officesaid the army would begin confiscating property of Palestinianparents who failed to cover the bail and fines of their children.   In Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, a leaflet signed by thePLO-backed uprising leadership called for a general strike on Dec.24 to mourn the deaths of the 631 Palestinians killed by Israelisoldiers and civilians in the revolt.   Forty-three Israelis also have been slain, and 161 otherPalestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as allegedcollaborators with Israel.   On Wednesday, 14 Palestinians were shot and wounded in scatteredstone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers in the occupied GazaStrip, Arab hospital officials said.   Monsignor Michel Sabbah, the Roman Catholic patriarch, calledfor peace in the Holy Land in his traditional Christmas message:   ``Peace on Earth is possible only when all people and all statesconcerned recognize the legitimate rights of all individuals andnations to freedom and self-determination.''   The study on the uprising in the Jaffee Center's annual MiddleEast Military Balance was based on army figures and conducted byAryeh Shalev, a retired army brigadier general who served asmilitary governor of the West Bank in 1976-78.   ``What I discovered is there was no reduction in the number ofincidents,'' Shalev told a news conference. ``It means to my mindthat (such measures) didn't have a serious effect on the strengthof the intefadeh,'' uprising in Arabic.   Since the uprising began in December 1987, army figures show 244houses have been destroyed and 116 sealed. But Shalev said they ledto no decrease in violence as claimed by army commanders.   ``We found no correlation whatsoever between the number ofhouses demolisehd and the number of violent incidents recorded, orthe number of Israeli casualties, or even the number of petrolbombs thrown, in the following month,'' Shalev wrote.   In fact, his study showed, the number of incidents increasedafter the heaviest periods of house demolitions. For example, 24houses were destroyed in November 1988, and incidents of stonethrowing, barricade building and rioting rose by 1,195, or about 74percent, to 2,790 in the following month.   Deportation of Palestinian activists has been considered themost severe measure against the uprising, but Shalev said it provedimpotent as a deterrent and actually inflamed the situation.   ``There is a clear correlation between the number of residentsdeported ... and an ensuing increase in the number of violentincidents and Israeli casualties,'' he said.   In April 1988, 16 Palestinians were deported, the largest numberin a single month, but the number of violent incidents rose by 210,he said, adding there was a similar rise after 13 deportations inJanuary 1989.   In all, 60 Palestinians were deported in the past two years.   Shalev said closing schools initially appeared to have arestraining effect on violence in early 1988. But he saidsubsequent closures failed to have an effect and by early 1989seemed to accelerate incidents.   Universities have been closed since the start of the uprising.Elementary, junior and high schools were closed in the West Bankfor eights months in 1988 and throughout the first half of 1989.   ``I don't think it is possible to stop the intefadeh (uprising)by using these or other means,'' Shalev told a news conferencehere, adding the only solution was a negotiated politicalsettlement.   Shalev suggested mass deportations and demolitions might reduceviolence but said such practice would not be possible because oflegal and moral restaints.</TEXT></DOC>
