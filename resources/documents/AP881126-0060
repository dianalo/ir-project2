The six-month Atlantic hurricane season, which officially endsWednesday, produced 11 named storms and six hurricanes, includingthe record-breaking Gilbert, and Tropical Storm Keith, which blewacross Florida last week but caused little damage except beacherosion and minor flooding. Forecasters called it an average stormseason.   There were 505 deaths recorded this year, but in the past, majorhurricanes have killed thousands when they hit Latin and Caribbeannations where many houses are unable to stand up to hurricane windsand flooding, said Bob Sheets, director of the National HurricaneCenter in nearby Coral Gables.   ``I'm pleased to say I think everything went very well,'' Sheetssaid. ``Even with the destruction we're talking about, loss of lifewas relatively small. The governments, I think, did an excellent jobin getting their people prepared.''   During the rise of Hurricane Joan last month, for example, thecenter was in constant contact with the Nicaraguan Embassy inWashington and the Colombian meteorological service, Sheets said.Forecasters spoke regularly with concerned parties in Panama andCosta Rica.   During Joan, Sheets said, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias``himself called four times here to this office.'' A week after thestorm, he sent his vice president to visit and thank employees fortheir help.   ``I know there are political differences that exist between theU.S., Nicaragua and Cuba,'' Sheets said, ``but those differencesaren't felt in the meteorological community.''   The sharing of information helped governments order evacuationsand take necessary precautions, Sheets said.   Sheets recalled that Hurricane Fifi, a 1974 storm that struckHonduras, killed 8,000 people. By contrast, 184 people died as aresult of Hurricane Joan's encounter with Central America.   Hal Gerrish, another hurricane center forecaster, said theinternational cooperation has been fostered by workshops thehurricane center has held, for at least the past six years, forofficials from other nations.   ``We have a 10-day course in both Spanish and English for theCaribbean forecasters,'' Gerrish said Saturday. ``Their leadforecasters will come up for refreshers and to get the latest onforecasting. This has created a pretty close fraternity among us.''   This year's season produced a record hurricane, Gilbert. Therewas talk of adding a new top rank to the Saffir-Simpson scale, asort of Richter scale for hurricanes, just to accommodate it, Sheetssaid.   He added that Gilbert will probably be recorded as one of thecostliest storms ever. Gil Clark of the hurricane center saidfigures are still preliminary, but he estimated the September stormdid $1 billion to $2 billion worth of damage, primarily in Jamaicaand Mexico.   Sheets noted that Gilbert ``was the lowest pressure ever recordedin this hemisphere.'' As a rule, the lower a hurricane's barometricpressure, the stronger its winds. Gilbert registered sustained windsas high as 175 mph.   Sheets compared Gilbert to the 1935 hurricane that hit theFlorida Keys, killing more than 400 people. Its winds were clockedat up to 200 mph; its pressure was the lowest recorded in thehemisphere before Gilbert.   Gilbert also ``was one of the largest hurricanes we've everseen,'' Sheets said.   The storm's eye measured 8 miles across. At one point, he said,Gilbert stretched across the Florida Keys, Cuba, the FloridaStraits, all of the western Caribbean and part of the Gulf ofMexico. It killed more than 300 people and did significant damage inMexico, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.   While Gilbert was ranked a 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, thescale's top rank, Joan rated a 4.   Sheets said that in the century the service has kept records,there has been no mention of a Category 4 storm in Central America.   Joan menaced Central America for days before blasting it with topwinds of 135 mph, causing mudslides, floods and other damage inNicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia and Panama.   Even after crossing land, Joan had sufficient strength to berenamed Miriam as a Pacific storm.   There are a lot of mysteries associated with hurricanes, and theseason's two biggest storms, which followed unusual paths for majorhurricanes, only added to them.   ``As far as understanding why we have a Gilbert or a Joan, indeedwe know what are the necessary conditions, but we don't know whatthe trigger mechanisms are,'' Sheets said.</TEXT></DOC>
