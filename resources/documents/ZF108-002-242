(415) 962-0195.andM;A rose is a rose is a rose, but all word processors are not alike:  Theprogram that's ideal for writing one kind of documentary may be a dud athandling another type.andP;  The sort of activity you engae in most often --writing to customers; generating form letters; struggling with columns oftext and numbers; writing highly structured technical manuals; preparingcomplex documents; or, perhaps, writing articles such as this one -- shoulddetermine the word processor you use.andP;  So instead of telling you which wordprocessor is the vest in the universe, I'm going to match real-life writingjobs with the talents of FullWrite Professional 1.1, MacWrite II 1.1,Microsoft Word 4.0, Microsoft Works 2.0, Microsoft Write, MindWrite 2.2,Nisus 2.03, WorkMaker 1.0.1, WordPerfect 1.0.3, and WriteNow 2.0.andP;  For a moredetailed, side-by-side, comparison of featres, see Table 2.andM;Writing LettersandM;Every program mentioned here lets you write letters, so you may as well getone that doesn't take a month to master and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.andO;Microsoft Write, WriteNow, and MacWrite II are three relatively easy-to-uselow-cost programs.andP;  The question is, is there anything to recommend one overthe others for writing letters and similar documents?andM;After writing several letters, you will probably decide on a particular setof features you prevfer for all your letters -- a certain font, for example,and perhaps a particular line spacing.andP;  With WriteNow and MacWrite II, youcan set up a blank stationery document that opens automatically in all newwindows and contains the specifications you like, so you don't have to resetthem each time.andM;As you become a vetegran letter writer, you may feel that you routinelyformat certain paragraphs of a letter in a style different from the maintext.andP;  With WriteNow, as a shortcut to making individual ruler changes eachtime you switch paragraph format, uou can copy all the format settings fromone paragraph and paste them into others.andP;  With MacWrite II, you can copyonly indents, tab stops, text alingment, and line spacing from one paragraphto another without setting each option separately.andM;In addition, letters are always dated.andP;  Write can insert a date only in aheader.andP;  Who wants to create a header for a simple letter?andP;  WriteNow's InsertDate command inserts the date at the insertion point or in place of thecurrent selection.andP;  MacWrite II also has such a feature.andM;Finally, you should check the spelling in every letter you write.andP;  Write'sspelling checker is adequate.andP;  MacWrite II has a mediocre spelling checkerthat is slow on a Mac Plus or SE.andP;  WriteNow's is great -- faster than eitherof the others and almost uncanny in its ability to suggest the correctspelling for every typo I come across in my documents.andP;  WriteNow winds handsdown on this one.andP;  (For information on stand-alone spelling-checker packages,see the &quot;Spelling It Right&quot; sidebar.)andM;When all is said and done, WriteNow stands out as the best choice for thefrequent letter writer because it's generally the fastest word processor onall types of Macintoshes (see Tables 1a and 1b), is easy to use, and cotainsthe features you're most likely to need for this task.andP;  For the same reasons,among the three programs considered so far, it is also the best &quot;first wordprocessor&quot; for students.andM;Processing Form LettersandM;&quot;In my business, I regularly send out form letters to my customers, who nownumber in the hundreds.andP;  I want the word processor with the best mail-mergesystem.&quot;andP;  With mail-merge, you combine a form letter with a mailing list.andO;The program automatically places each name and address in the form letter forprinting.andP;  To meet this demand, you might expect to have to purchase ahigh-end word processor.andP;  But you don't -- MacWrite II has an elegantmail-merge facility that helps you bypass the tedium of setting up a formletter and the file of names and addresses to be inserted into it.andM;Every word processor that handles mail-merge requires you to set up a datadocument and a form letter.andP;  In all these programs, you set up the data fileby listing the desired fields across the screen.andP;  The fields are separated bytabs in MacWrite II, but you can define them with commas in some otherprograms.andP;  On each row below the list of field names, you enter the actualdata for each record, and then you open a new window and create the formletter (see Figure 1a).andM;With all mail-merge systems, there has to be some way for the program to knowthat a particular field name in the letter means &quot;insert data from this fieldof each record at this point in the letter.&quot;andP;  This is usually indicated bysurrounding the field name in the form letter with what are calledfield-delimiter symbols, such as andless;andless; and andgt;andgt;.andP;  With most programs, includingsuch giants as Word 4.0, you type the andless;andless; and andgt;andgt; before and after each fieldname in the letter, a time-consuming task at best and one that can introduceerrors such as extra spaces where you don't want them.andP;  With MacWrite, bycontrast, as you write the letter, you insert a field simply by selecting itfrom a pop-up scrolling list of field names from the data document.andO;Double-click on the field name in the list, and MacWrite II pastes it intoyour letter, along with the field-delimiter symbols.andP;  MacWrite also lets youinsert IF/THEN/ELSE conditions into form letters by double-clicking on themfrom the same scrolling list.andP;  Best of all, the menu from which you selectfields and conditions can be opened and left on-screen like any other windowwhile you create the form letter (see Figure 1b).andP;  Nice.andM;Creating Columns and TablesandM;All word processors claim to handle multiple columns.andP;  So why do many Macusers become desperate when they are faced with creating a multicolumn page?andO;Take the worstcase scenario -- using Microsoft Write to create columns.andP;  Thisprogram's multiple-columns feature is no more than a token gesture.andP;  It letsyou create only snaking newspaper-style columns, not parallel ones.andP;  (Snakingtext flows from the bottom of one column to the top of the next column on thesame page; with parallel columns, when the text reaches the bottom of thepage, it continues in the corresponding column on the next page.)andP;  And youcan't view the text on an editing screen in columns -- you can use thePreview mode to see the columns, but you can't edit them on the previewscreen.andP;  Worst of all, Write automatically formats the whole document,including the first page, with the number of columns you've chosen with PageSetup.andM;WriteNow's handling of columns isn't much better.andP;  To set intercolumnspacing, you must adjust the columns' paragraph margins until you get thesetup you want, which can be a painful trial-and-error process.andP;  And you arelimited to four columns.andM;MacWrite II does it right.andP;  Just select the Page command from the Formatmenu.andP;  On one screen, you enter the number of columns you want -- up to ten-- and specify how far apart you want them.andP;  MacWrite II calculates the widthof each column from your choice of page size, page orientation, and left andright margins, as well as the number of columns and the amount of spacebetween them.andP;  It does not, however, do parallel multicolumn text tables,only snaking newspaper-style columns.andM;On the high end, only WordPerfect and Word 4.0 let you do both snaking andparallel columns.andP;  Creating snaking columns with WordPerfect is clumsy,however.andP;  Let's say, for example, you want to insert a section of two-columntext in the middle of a page.andP;  Two snaking columns rarely turn out to be thesame length.andP;  With WordPerfect, you must balance uneven columns manually byshortening the page at the bottom of the multiple columns.andP;  It's only on thenext page that you can switch back to a one-column layout.andP;  In addition,scrolling through a multicolumn document in WordPerfect is so much slowerthan the program's normal scrolling speed that you may regret having put yourtext into columns.andM;Word 4.0 and FullWrite automatically adjust and balance the length of yourcolumns so they come out even.andP;  Then they let you switch back to a one-columnlayout on the same page.andP;  When it comes to parallel columns, it isn't thatWordPerfect is clumsy, but it's that Word 4.0 is great.andP;  To create parallelcolumns with Word 4.0, you simply select Insert Table from the Document menuand a spreadsheetlike grid appears on-screen (see Figure 2).andP;  Textautomatically wraps within each cell, and the rows expand to the size of thelargest cell in the row.andP;  You can specify the number of rows and columns whenyou insert the table into your document, or you can start with the default ofone row and two columns and add more of either when you need them.andP;  You canalso easily adjust column widths even after you've entered text -- the textrewraps to fit the new cell size.andM;If you've ever created a document with multicolumn tables and then enduredthe agony of trying to keep each row and column in line while you added anddeleted text, working with Word 4.0's Table feature will be a pleasurableexperience.andP;  One reader recently complained in a letter to the editor thatyou could boil an egg while waiting for Word 4.0 to insert a table (itactually takes only about three to ten seconds on my Mac 512KE, depending onthe size of the table).andP;  The reader failed to mention that you could prepareeggs Benedict for 20 while trying to set up a similar table with any otherword processor.andM;Writing Technical ManualsandM;Writers of technical documents don't start with a blank page and constructsomething out of pure creative energy.andP;  The software guides I write are allerector-set projects -- I construct a new book from many existing files (and,often, bits and pieces of those).andP;  In this type of writing, the ability toorganize material is of paramount importance.andP;  MindWrite and Nisus both havespecial features that make organizing work much easier.andM;Because MindWrite integrates word processing and outlining better than doesany other program, it's easy to turn pages of paragraphs and headings into anoutline and then collapse the outline to show just the headings, to get anoverview of the document's structure.andP;  Move a heading in this collapsed view,and all the text under it moves too.andP;  Or expand the outline (or just sectionsof it), grab a paragraph from a section with MindWrite's efficient grabberhand, and move it into another section.andP;  All sections are renumberedautomatically (see Figures 3a and 3b).andM;When you need a list of bulleted paragraphs, simply press Command-8 and thenCommand-R--no need to bother with hanging indents.andP;  When you've finished thelist, press Command-H and then Command-L to return to ordinary paragraphs.andM;If you have bits and pieces of text or text and graphics that you would liketo pull into a new section, it's easy with MindWrite's Disjoint selection.andO;Start by selecting the items in the order in which you want them organizedwhen they are brought together.andP;  Once you've selected all the items, positionthe grabber hand to the left of any one of them, hold down the mouse buttonto close the hand, and then drag the hand to the location you've chosen forthe new section.andP;  The items are gathered, ordered, and relocatedautomatically.andP;  You can even conduct a search operation that finds allheadings and paragraphs that contain a specified word or phrase and gatherthem together in a separate window.andM;Similarly, creating a table of contents is smooth and easy with MindWrite.andO;Just select Table of Contents from the Search menu, and then select thenumber of heading levels you want included in the table.andP;  That's it.andO;MindWrite pulls everything into a new window with headings and their pagenumbers neatly listed.andM;Nisus doesn't match MindWrite's ability for rearranging parts of a document,but it can do several useful tricks that no other word processor can do.andO;First, Nisus lets you search through multiple open or closed files.andP;  Nothingyou've ever written is out of its reach.andP;  Second, you can do almost anythingimaginable to searched-for text.andP;  For example, you can add or change theformatting of specified items in any file, or you can index every boldfacedword in each of 20 documents and then pull all the indexes into one new fileand re-sort them (see Figure 4).andP;  Third, you can automate any set ofprocedures with Nisus' built-in macros and programming commands.andP;  Of course,you have to be willing to master these features or have someone on hand whocan do it.andM;Add in Nisus' multiple editable clipboards and multiple undos (up to 300),and you have an obsessive organizer's dream word processor.andP;  As messy as youmay be with the information you store, Nisus can keep it within reach whenyou're ready to assemble your technical document.andP;  WordPerfect is the formerchamp at file management, letting you look into any file on your disk withoutclosing your current document.andP;  But Nisus goes far beyond WordPerfect'scapabilities.andM;Preparing Complex DocumentsandM;As you move up the word-processing ladder into what is often called high-endor heavyweight writing, you enter the realm is which you don't justwrite--you prepare documents.andP;  Complex documents may have lots of long quotesthat have to be justified and indented on both sides.andP;  They may needfootnotes and/or end notes.andP;  A table of contents and an index may berequired.andP;  And several levels of headings, each with its own format, areusually needed.andM;The prime contenders for this type of writing are FullWrite Professional,Word 4.0, and Nisus.andP;  The best-looking program for this type of job isFullWrite Professional.andP;  Along with many other users, I was excited by itsarrival after years of vaporware status.andP;  And straight out of the box, it didlook great.andP;  It offers not only the usual headers and footnotes but alsoposted notes and bibliography entries that are automatically compiled whenthe document is printed.andP;  But the amount of RAM that FullWrite needs isenormous: I couldn't load the spelling checker into a 1-megabyte machine.andO;And even on an SE with 2 megabytes, it ran slowly.andP;  The final letdown camewhen the program rejected a 50-page document as too large on a 2-megabytesystem.andP;  Version 1.1 handles large files better, but this program works beston a Mac II or later machine.andM;Word 4.0 is faster than FullWrite is, but it's not fast.andP;  In fact, the onlyfast Mac heavyweight word processor is Nisus -- a big plus for Nisus.andP;  Word4.0's spelling checker takes so long to suggest the correct substitute that Iend up typing it myself.andP;  Even finding the misspellings takes too long.andO;After I'd written a couple of books this way, Nisus' spelling checker had mesmiling.andM;Nisus has several other nice features.andP;  If you've ever wanted to draw anarrow from one place to another in a document, try Nisus'graphics-within-text facility.andP;  If you fear creating an index or table ofcontents, you'll appreciate Nisus' speed and ease of use.andP;  If you jump aroundyour documents looking for related pieces of text, you can use Nisus'cross-referncing feature, which lets you maintain accurate references toother parts of your document.andM;But Nisus doesn't have it all.andP;  Its major deficit is its lack of stylesheets.andP;  Only Word has them, and they definitely make a difference.andM;The style sheet has to be the most misunderstood feature in the entire realmof word processing.andP;  When Microsoft first introduced style sheets for PCversions of Word, few users could figure out how to use them.andP;  But the waythey are implemented in Word 4.0 makes them a suitable topic for &quot;SesameStreet.&quot;andP;  Say, for example, you want the level-1 headings of your documentcentered and styled in Geneva 14 bold.andP;  Create one head that way, and tellWord it's your Head 1 style (see Figure 5).andP;  Then, whenever you want to usethat style of head, pull down the tyle menu on the ruler and click on Head 1.andM;Word has been criticized because styles can't be stored independently ofdocuments.andP;  But Word 4.0 lets you import the heading styles from one documentto another with a few keystrokes or mouse clicks.andP;  So if you have a set ofstyles you use frequently, you can store them all in one style document andquickly import them anytime you need them.andP;  An advantage of this system isthat if you have several sets of heading styles, you don't have to inventcute names to distinguish one level-2 head from other level-2 heads.andO;Instead, when you want the set of heading styles one editor, publisher, orboss likes, just grab those all at once.andM;Although FullWrite and Nisus have ways to transfer styles from one paragraphto another, these systems don't allow easy changing of all text set in aparticular style.andP;  Word 4.0 does.andP;  Just change the style definition, andeverything defined in that style changes to conform to the new definition.andO;To complete the package, a new $25 upgrade to PageMaker 3.02 lets it importWord 4.0 documents, styles and all.andM;In addition to providing style sheets, Word 4.0 outdoes all its competitorswith a full array of customizable keyboard editing commands.andP;  For somereason, few word processors provide an easy way to select a sentence.andP;  Nisuslets you select a line, but how often do you pull a line out of the middle ofa paragraph?andP;  But users delete, copy, and move sentences all the time.andP;  Word4.0 lets you do this without dragging the mouse.andP;  Similarly, to change fontswith Word 4.0, simply press Command-Shift-E and enter the first two lettersof the font name.andP;  Such keyboard shortcuts save immeasurable time over thecourse of creating a book or long business report.andM;At the moment, Nisus and Word 4.0 seem to be the top contenders forheavyweight word processing.andP;  Like FullWrite before it, Nisus arrived on thescene destined to overthrow Word, according to many reports.andP;  Whether Nisuswill replace Word 4.0 for your writing depends on three questions, however.andO;First, to what extent do you see your word processor as a file manager?andO;After test-driving Nisus and talking to several Nisus converts, it becameclear to me that one of its main attractions is its macro search system.andP;  Inthe hands of experienced programmers, it can become an indispensable tool forindexing, cataloging, converting databases to documents, and other suchtasks.andM;The second Nisus-versus-Word consideration is the size of your documents.andO;Nisus' speed is due, in part, to its keeping itself and your document in RAM.andO;However, this limits the size of document the program can handle.andP;  Word 4.0,by contrast, uses a virtual-memory system in which parts of the program orthe document are moved back and forth between memory and disk.andP;  If yourdocuments fit into Nisus, its speed may convert you from Word.andP;  If theydon't, you'll either have to get a Mac with more memory or use Connectix'Virtual on a 68030 Mac.andM;The final question is, how often do you use spreadsheet data in yourdocuments?andP;  Unlike Nisus, Word 4.0 can form dynamic links with Excelspreadsheets.andP;  If your business documents often incorporate spreadsheet data,you may want the combination of Word 4.0 and Excel, which gives you a tightlyintegrated package.andM;Preparing Text/GraphicsandM;DocumentsandM;As with mail-merge, this might be an instance in which you would assume thatyou need a high-end program.andP;  But do you really need all that power andcomplexity if you're putting together a one-page flier or a classroom handoutor an overhead transparency?andP;  You may not want to tame a tiger such as Nisusor FullWrite for such simple jobs.andP;  Two much less expensive andeasier-to-master choices for such lightweight desk-top-publishing tasks areMacWrite II and WordMaker.andP;  MacWrite II supports color text and lets youplace MacPant and PICT graphics directly in documents.andP;  But WordMaker, thelowest-priced word processor discussed here, places pasted graphics (whetherbit-mapped or object) into a layer of a document above the text.andP;  So you canplace them almost anywhere, even on top of text, as long as solid coloredareas of the graphics don't hide your words.andP;  And when you move a section oftext, any attached graphics move with it.andP;  You can even wrap lines of textaround graphics by setting separate margins for each line.andP;  This is notsomething you would want to do if you were creating a document with 50illustrations, but it's no trouble for a one- or two-page graphics-and-textdocument (see Figure 6).andP;  With this surprising array of graphicscapabilities, WordMaker is a great buy for short text-and-graphics documents.andO;The need to add such &quot;objects&quot; as a graphic or a boxed paragraph in themiddle of a page of your document may dramatically change your word-processorpreference.andM;For bigger jobs, try Nisus or FullWrite.andP;  With Nisus you can create a graphicobject directly in the text by going into the Graphics mode and using thegraphics tools.andP;  While in the Graphics mode, you can paste a graphic intoyour text as an object graphic and have the text flow through it or wraparound it.andP;  While in the Text mode, you can paste an object graphic into yourtext and it will become a character graphic, which acts just like a textcharacter.andM;Feature for feature, however, FullWrite Professional comes closer to thecapabilities of dedicated page-layout programs than does any other Mac wordprocessor.andP;  FullWrite offers adjustable kerning, leading, and guttering.andP;  Itcan flow text and columns around graphics, and it includes an integrateddrawing module.andP;  Again, its downfall so far has been its restriction to bigMacs, its slow speed, and its erratic aversion to large files.andM;For real desktop publishing, don't kid yourself into thinking you can get bywithout a page-layout program.andP;  Why do you think word processors such asNisus include filters you can install into PageMaker to enable you to placeyour documents into it?andM;The Integrated DocumentandM;The word-processing module in Microsoft Works 2.0 occupies a unique niche inthe Mac writing world.andP;  It is one of five modules in an integrated package.andO;The others are spreadsheet, database, telecommunications, and drawingmodules.andP;  Even on a 1-megabyte Mac Plus running without MultiFinder, you notonly can draw directly in a document (rather than draw in a separate programand then cut and paste), but you can also quickly cut and paste spreadsheetor database information.andP;  In addition, while on-line in thetelecommunications module, you can use a word-processing window to write amessage and then upload it.andP;  When you capture data, it automatically becomesa word-processing document.andP;  So if you routinely do any such tasks or wouldif you had Works, it may be just what you need.andM;Unfortunately, the word processor is mediocre, much more like Write thanWord.andP;  It can't handle multiple columns.andP;  You have to resort to a drawprocedure in which you create columns as text objects.andP;  To create a header orfooter, not only must you type it into a small box on the Page Setup screenbut you must also regress to typing commands that would be primitive even fora DOS word processor, such as andamp;R for flush right or andamp;P and andamp;D to include thepage number and date.andP;  In addition, the word processor lacks many of Word'smost useful keyboard commands as well as its footnoting capability and itsstyle sheets.andP;  There is no writing task for which the Works word processoralone is the best choice, but if you want a cheap and easy route to creatingdocuments with charts, drawings, database records, and spreadsheet numbers,the Works package is the only game in town.andM;Connecting with DOS and MailandM;Despite many users' desire to have a Mac-based universe, some people stillhave to deal with the task of working on a document on both PCs and Macs.andP;  Ifyou find yourself banging your head in frustration when translating andreformatting DOS files to Mac files (and vice versa), then WordPerfect is theprogram for you.andP;  Although WordPerfect for the Macintosh is a half-heartedtransformation from the PC world and has a clumsy, un-Mac-like interface, MacWordPerfect files are universally exchangeable, formatting intact, withalmost every type of computer system.andP;  This can make all the difference forcorporations that support ten different systems at the same time.andM;When you're using word processing within a work-group setting, in whichmore-complex interchange is possible among people performing differentfunctions, Word has a definite advantage.andP;  Word's File menu has commands thatlet you send the document you're working on through the Microsoft Mailserver.andP;  When you select Send Mail, Microsoft Mail opens; your document titleis already in the subject area, and the document is automatically included.andO;All you do is write a message.andP;  This first example of interapplicationcommunication saves only a few steps, but along with the further integrationof Microsoft Mail with Excel, it's a glimpse of the future.andM;Unending SearchandM;Word processors have the ability to evoke passionate feelings in their users.andO;This fact has led to a quest for the one great word processor that serves allthe writing and document-preparation needs of every user better than anyother program.andP;  Perhaps that dream will be fulfilled one day -- by Word 10 orNisus 4 or WriteNow 7.andM;But for the moment, Mac users who want the best tool for every possiblewriting job will have to stack their hard disks with a half a dozen programsand become nimble at using MultiFinder and handling file transfers.andP;  It's animperfect world after all.andM;Charles Spezzano writes about psychology and personal computers.andP;  He is theauthor of two books and numerous articles on IBM and Macintosh hardware andsoftware.andM;Bibliographic DatabasesandM;Certain kinds of documents, incluing academic and legal papers, have specificformatting requirements for footnotes and endnoes.andP;  Meeting thse annotationrequirements becomes more difficult when documents go through many revisions.andO;Numbered references go out of sequence, and tracking specific citations andcross-references becomes a task beyond the capabilities of most wordprocessors because they are not database programs with sophisticatedsearching functions.andP;  Specialized bibliographic programs have arisen toaddress these needs.andP;  Two of the better ones are presented here.andM;EndNote 1.2.1  1/2andM;EndNote is a DA that works in conjunction with word processors--includingMacWrite, WriteNow, Microsoft Word 4.0, and WordPerfect 1.0.3--as well aswith text-only files.andP;  The program is also available as a separateapplication for use with a word processor under MultiFinder.andP;  You can pasteformatted in-text citations directly into a word-processing document, andEndNote then creates a bibliography from the citations.andP;  Requires Mac 512KEor later and System 4.1 or later.andM;Pros: Being a DA, allows easy access to word-processing files for pasting incitations.andM;Cons: Cannot print formatted bibliographies from the application itself.andO;Search capability much more limited than Pro-Cite's.andP;

 By identifying the type of writingyou do most, you should be able to find a package you'll be reasonably happywith.andM;Many people have introduced themselves to the world of Mac word processing bybuying Microsoft Works, an integrated package that also includes spreadsheet,database, telecommunications, and drawing modules.andP;  Works is a good buy ifyou want basic functionality in each mode, even though the word-processingmodule is mediocre.andP;  Power users, however, will quickly outgrow the package.andM;On the lower end of the word-processing scale, WriteNow will seduce letterwriters and high school students into the bliss of word processing.andP;  It'slast on all types of Macs, keeps text centered onscreen as you write, and hasa great spelling checker.andP;  Plus it stays out of your way while you write,better than any other program does.andM;MacWrite II makes mail-merge straightforward, with a menu-driven system forconstructing letters and data documents, and handles snaking columns withequal elegance.andP;  Its spelling checker is mediocre, however, so you might wantto get an additional spelling checker to round it out.andM;If you want an inexpensive basic package that has a good array of graphicscapabilities, give WordMaker a shot.andP;  You should be forewarned, however, thatWordMaker is slow and has limited file-import and -export capabilities.andM;On the higher end, both MindWrite and Nisus are useful for technical writers.andO;If you're looking for a terrific tool for organizing technical documents,then MindWrite is probably your best bet: Its blend of outlining and wordprocessing allows you to rearrange in more ways than a manic interiordecorator.andM;On the other hand, Nisus can search through, retrieve from, and manipulatetext in multiple open and closed files -- making the construction of atechnical document from pieces of other documents an almost humaneundertaking.andP;
