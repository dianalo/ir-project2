This is a monarch-in-waiting who has to earnhis living, which he does as a consultant in shipping, insurance andadvertising.;    But since the beginning of this year, the increasing tempo ofconstitutional discussion has left him little time for business.;    Withtanks on the streets in Serbia and Croatia, Alexander's friends and advisersbelieve the tide could turn suddenly in favor of restoration of the monarchyas a way of uniting the warring federation of six republics.;    In a poll bythe Slovenian newspaper Mladina, 66.9 percent said they didn't know whetherthe monarchy could provide a better solution than the present constitutionaloptions, but it couldn't possibly be worse. That's the way politics are inYugoslavia.;    &quot;Restoration of the monarchy was theoretical until PresidentTito's death. When he died in 1980, that created new possibilities,&quot; said oneof the crown prince's friends, Nemanja Marcetic, editor of the London-basedSouth Slav Journal.;    If the monarchy is restored, Alexander will bestepping into danger. Two of his ancestors were murdered. &quot;Black&quot; George,founder of the Karadjordje dynasty in 1811 was axed to death on the orders ofa rival, who had his head stuffed. Alexander's grandfather was assassinated inMarseilles in 1934 by a Macedonian terrorist.;    Alexander has never set footin his homeland, although he has flown over it and sailed along the coast. Now45, he was born in exile at London's Claridges Hotel in 1945.;    Alexander'sfather, King Peter II, brought him up to believe that his first duty was tothe country of which he had been dispossessed -- along with the family's land,castles and fortune -- by Tito.;    For a long time the idea of returning toYugoslavia must have seemed a faint dream. In 1948 the family moved to NewYork. Alexander, who speaks six languages, had a cosmopolitan upbringing --schools in Britain, Switzerland, a military academy in the United States,Sandhurst royal military academy in England, a commission in an elite Britishregiment.;    When King Peter died in 1970, Alexander decided not to claim thetitle.;    A friend said: &quot;There was a group of people who tried to get him tobecome king, but he thought that to be a country-less king would be absurd andunrealistic. He is a very down-to-earth man. He had to earn a living. Hecouldn't afford to just sit around wishing he were king.&quot;;    As an ardentdemocrat, Alexander wants to be restored only through the ballot box. Hepoints out the stability provided by constitutional monarchy in WesternEurope. Six of the 12 European Community countries are monarchies.;    &quot;Ithink the monarchy provides hope,&quot; he has said.
