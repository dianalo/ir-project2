An important advantage of themodel structure utilized is that it specifies dynamic demand using thesame distributed lag functional form as is often used in empirical work.The model is formulated as an autonomous, infinite horizon optimal controlproblem. An analysis of the first order necessary conditions indicatesthat, under steady-state conditions, a policy of marginal cost pricingshould be followed. The basic model is modified by adding a breakevenconstraint to produce a dynamic version of the well known Ramsey pricingrule. A comparison of the dynamic rule with that derived for the staticcase indicates that significant errors can result if the latter is appliedin cases where demand exhibits a dynamic structure. Finally, some implicationsof the dynamic demand phenomenon for the regulation of public utilitiesare considered. It is shown that, if two utilities serve markets withequal short-run price elasticities, but one market has a dynamic demandstructure and the other does not, then the difference between profitmaximizing prices and Ramsey-optimal prices will be smaller in the dynamicmarket.</TEXT></DOC>
