ATandamp;T said its service charge for all out-of-state collect calls,calls billed to a third number and pay-phone calls would rise to$1.75. The service charge on most of those calls is now $1.55 andlower for short-distance calls.   The service charge on operator-dialed calls charged to an ATandamp;Tcredit card, now $1.55, also would rise to $1.75. Also, the companywould set a uniform surcharge of 80 cents for interstate ATandamp;Tcredit card calls that are customer-dialed. The charge for most ofthese calls is already 80 cents, but it is 60 cents forshort-distance calls that cross state lines.   The company additionally is proposing to raise its servicecharge on interstate, person-to-person calls from $3 to $3.50.   The proposed increases would go into effect July 16, under plansATandamp;T filed with the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC mustapprove the increases before they can take effect.   ATandamp;T said its service charges for operator-assisted calls havenot changed since 1982, though costs for providing those serviceshave risen an average of $159 million a year during the past fiveyears.   As part of the proposal, ATandamp;T also wants to charge callers 75cents for calls they ask the operator to dial, beginning Dec. 1.   The charge would not apply if the caller is unable to completehis or her call for any reason, including customer error, butcallers would have to tell the operator they had tried to dial thecall themselves. It also would not apply to disabled customers whoneed an operator's assistance.   The company said that for one year its operators would informcallers if they are subject to the 75-cent surcharge.   Also beginning Dec. 1, ATandamp;T wants to charge out-of-state callers$2 to have an operator verify a busy line is in use and another $2if the caller wants the operator to interrupt the call. ATandamp;Tcurrently does not charge for these services.</TEXT></DOC>
