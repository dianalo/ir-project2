(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A hacker who browsed for weeks throughthe unclassified computer system of a top federal nuclear weaponslaboratory has been identified and has apologized to authorities.   No arrests have been made, officials said Saturday. FBI and labofficials refused to identify the hacker.   ``In a communication, he regretted the difficulty caused by hisactions and agreed to stop accessing LLNL computers,'' said JeffGarberson, spokesman at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.   Lab officials had pleaded through local media for the hacker tocontact them. The pleas led to several phone calls identifyingpossible suspects, but it was unclear if the identity of the hackerwas discovered through a tip.   A spokesman said earlier in the week that the hacker did notinvade the lab's top secret nuclear weapons research computers,which are physically and electronically separated from theunclassified system.   The lab, run by the University of California at Berkeley, is oneof the nation's two centers for design, manufacture and testing ofnuclear weapons. The other is at Los Alamos, N.M.   The FBI is investigating the case, spokesman John Holford said.   Garberson said because criminal charges may be filed, labofficials will not provide any further information.   The hacker first appeared on the lab's Internet system about twoweeks ago. The system connects research facilities and universitiesnationwide.   The hacker accessed various computers at the lab and even gavehimself ``super user'' status so he could roam through files.However, no data or files were destroyed.   Lab officials described him as ``joy riding'' through the systemto see what he could get into. He made at least 11 systemtrespasses, the last on Dec. 10.   The infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by acomputer ``virus'' that struck nationwide last month and by anotherhacker two weeks ago. Both of the latest invasions were throughdifferent holes in the system and there may yet be other accesspoints that have not been patched.</TEXT></DOC>
