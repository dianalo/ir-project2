<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-1029 </DOCNO><TEXT>Isotopic dating is valuable in correlating sections and constructing regionalor general stratigraphic scales; particular importance attaches to Precambrianformations, for which classical stratigraphic, paleontological, and lithologicaltechniques are ineffective or less reliable than in the Phanerozoic.Considerable advances in this field have been made in the last 15-20years: the Rb-Sr method has made it possible to date clayey sediments,which are common in beds of virtually all ages. The topic is complicatedand requires not only the solution of special analytical problems butalso reliable confirmation of methods. This paper discusses lithologicalbasis, mineralogical and geochemical basis, dimensions of clay minerals,the processes dated, and model forms of dating for clayey rocks. Resultsof dating several deposits are discussed. 39 references.</TEXT></DOC>
