That isn't all bad. And if you're up for a first-rate newhistory series, tune in tonight to the debut of ``The Road To War.''   Airing on the A andamp; E Network, this eight-part series, aco-production of A andamp; E and the BBC, studies the origins of WorldWar II in the two decades that preceded Hitler's invasion of Polandin September 50 years ago.   What makes this ``Road'' different from previous series aboutthe war, such as the excellent ``The World at War,'' is that itexamines the social and political events leading to World War II ineach major nation involved.   Each nation gets a separate, one-hour look. In order ofappearance, they are Germany, Great Britain, Japan, the UnitedStates, France, Italy, and the Soviet Union, with the final chapterentitled ``Global War,'' a summing-up of sorts.   Another plus: As tonight's opening ``Germany'' shows, the BBCteam has gone to extraordinary lengths not only to unearth rarelyseen newsreel and Nazi propaganda footage, but also appears to havestruck new, crisp-looking prints of them and restored as much aspossible their sound tracks.   All that gives a strange sense of immediacy when woven in withinterviews of now-elderly Germans _ military men, diplomats,civilians, even a benign-looking former Nazi storm trooper.   They witnessed Hitler's rise to power, many met him, and, in thecase of one Socialist member of the Reichstag in 1932-33, went to aconcentration camp because of him.   Older viewers will find familiar the documentary's re-telling ofhow Germany's sufferings after its defeat in World War I led to thepolitical triumphs of Hitler and the Nazi Party, then hispersecution and murder of Jews, his lust for domination and war.   But regardless of the age of the viewer, this chapter is still avaluable history lesson, one made striking with Nazi ``newsreel''footage that includes:   _ Shots of storm troopers at night burning what a Nazi narratorcalls ``un-German and immoral books.''   _ Pictures of fleeing refugees, identified as as ``ethnicGermans ... being driven out of Poland'' _ the scenes staged toincite German support of Hitler's propaganda, his claim that he hadcause to invade Poland.   There's brilliant editing, too, in ``Germany,'' particularlythen-and-now scenes of Vienna. The contrasts are made as one hearsold recordings of Hitler's frenzied speeches after his``unification'' of Austria and Germany in 1938.   It's also very, very eerie and unsettling to hear awell-dressed, obviously educated, now-60ish witness of those timesin Vienna, explain in her soft, matter-of-fact way, why she andothers there supported Hitler.   One reason, she says without apparent shame or regret, ``was allabout the Jews ...'' It gets worse as she continues, saying,``first of all, it was their behavior, and their appearance ...they really didn't belong to Vienna, in a way.''   Incredible.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television...   HERE COMES THE JUDGE _ As expected, Cable News Network says thatCatherine Crier, a young former Texas district judge with no newsbackground, and veteran newsman Bernard Shaw will co-anchor its new``The World Today'' one-hour weeknight newscast that premieres onMonday.   She will anchor from CNN's Atlanta headquarters, he from itsWashington bureau. Their new program, starting at 6 p.m. EDT eachweeknight, will be competing in its second half hour with thenightly newscasts of CBS, NBC and ABC, but only in Eastern andCentral time zones.   The big networks tape-delay their newscasts for broadcast on theWest Coast because of the three-hours-later time difference there.CNN's new show, a spokeswoman says, will be fed live nationally,with no tape-delay showings.   ROAD TO PEACE _ Next Monday also is when CNN starts the sixthand final week of its ``Waging Peace'' series of six-minute weekdayspecials and half-hour Saturday roundups on the prospects for peacearound the globe.   Two staffers on the series, Peter Arnett and Richard Blystone,once reported on the Vietnam War for The Associated Press, Arnettfor a number of years. It must be a strange feeling to be a peacecorrespondent now ...</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday PMs, Oct. 11</NOTE></DOC>
