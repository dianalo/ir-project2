(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bears, deer, skunks and other creatures thatusually prefer to stay far from humans are being driven by thedrought to unaccustomed boldness in their search for food and water.   So far this year, 30 bears have been spotted from Reno to LakeTahoe in western Nevada compared with the normal three to fiveannually, and there has been a virtual invasion of skunks inresidential areas, wildlife officials said Monday.   ``Anything that's green looks good to them,'' said GilbertMarrugo, the state director of animal damage control. ``The bestthing to do is not feed them because they'll come back for more.''   Marrugo said the Reno-Sparks area and neighboring counties areseeing a huge increase in the number of rabbits and skunks nearrural homes, although exact numbers are unavailable since manyencounters aren't reported.   ``There's an explosion of rabbits in the area this year,''Marrugo said. ``We've already had five or six complaints of damagethey've caused in flower beds or hay fields _ not a lot, but thesummer's just beginning. A pack of them can ruin 25 acres.''   Skunks also are showing up in record numbers, particularly inthe valleys north of Reno and in Verdi to the west, Marrugo said.   ``One woman in Verdi has trapped 29 skunks under her house inthe past two years,'' he said. ``It's a virtual invasion in someareas.''   Gregg Tanner, a supervising game biologist for the NevadaDepartment of Wildlife, said big game and small animals aremigrating in search of new water supplies and range land becauseback-to-back dry years have decreased forage and stream flows.   ``They concentrate around any free water source they find,'' hesaid.   Already this year, more than 30 black bears have been sightedlooking for food among humans, mostly around the Lake Tahoe Basinarea, he said. In a normal year, the state Wildlife Departmentreceives reports of three to five sightings.   ``I think you can attribute this to the drought year,'' Tannersaid. ``Their normal food supply has been impacted so they'relooking through the garbage for food.   ``There have been no confrontations'' with humans, since thebears usually are scared off, Tanner said. ``But any time you geturban dwellers directly in contact with a bear there's a lot of _well _ concerned folks.''   A mild winter spared most of the state's mule deer, leaving a10-year high of 250,000 of the long-eared, black-tailed creaturescompeting for scarce forage and water, Tanner said. Now, those deeralong with bighorn sheep and antelopes are migrating toward farms,ranches and other rural residences in search of food and water.   ``During the summer months it will only get worse,'' Tannersaid. ``I expect a difficult fall, having to deal with all theproblems to stop the depredation.''   Shriveling wetlands in the western Nevada valleys normally fedby winter snowmelt are another peril of the drought, Tanner said.Small die-offs of fish and waterfowl already have occurred, hesaid, and more are expected.   ``It's too early to count our losses yet,'' he said. ``We justhave to take the lumps when they come.''</TEXT></DOC>
