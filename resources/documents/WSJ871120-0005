The commission referred the matter to Justice Department attorneys, the sources said, after concluding that Mr. Trump used so-called put-and-call options agreements to acquire stock of Bally Manufacturing Corp. and Holiday Corp. without complying with reporting requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act.    Sources said the FTC asked that separate civil suits be filed involving Mr. Trump's investments in both companies, but Justice Department officials haven't told the commission whether they intend to take such action. The Justice Department makes the final decision on filing such cases.    An FTC spokesman declined to comment. The investigation was first reported in FTC Watch, a publication about regulatory matters. Reached in New York last night, Mr. Trump confirmed that the FTC had made the request. He declined to elaborate.    Earlier this year, the FTC asked Justice Department attorneys to file similar civil cases against Wickes Cos. and a firm controlled by Canada's Belzberg family. Final decision haven't been made on those matters, either.    The commission's vote is part of a crackdown on a technique in which a brokerage house assembles a large block of stock under an options agreement with a corporate raider. But the raider doesn't buy the stock until he gets federal antitrust clearance to increase his stake in the target company.    A source said the recommendation involving Mr. Trump, like the earlier requests to the Justice Department, don't seek a specific penalty. </TEXT></DOC>
