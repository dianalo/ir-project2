Protests To Israel Over Closing Of Border</HEAD><BYLINE>By CAROLYN AYON LEE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Nations has protested Israel'stemporary closing of the Lebanon-Israeli border to U.N. peacekeepingtroops, U.N. officials said Wednesday.   Israel closed the border for nearly 20 hours, from Tuesdayafternoon until Wednesday morning.   ``This unacceptable action was stated to be in retaliation'' foran incident Tuesday in which U.N. peacekeeping troops blockedIsraeli army vehicles from entering the village of Ebel es Saqi,said Nadia Younes, spokeswoman for Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar.   Ms. Younes said that under a longstanding informal agreement, theIsraeli army is barred from deploying vehicles in Ebel es Saqi,where the headquarters of the Norwegian battalion of the U.N.Interim Force in Lebanon are located.   The Israel Defense Forces ``challenged UNIFIL's action and atense situation ensued,'' during which an Israeli tank was used toforce U.N. vehicles off the road, said Ms. Younes.   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said at a military base innorthern Israel on Wednesday: ``We have said time and again, when itcomes to UNIFIL, that we don't ask them to stay here, we don't askthem to leave, but at the same time we will not allow any change intheir deployment and any interference by UNIFIL to the freedom ofmovement of the IDF. This is the way that we see it.''   The peacekeeping troops of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanonpatrol a narrow strip north of Israel's self-declared ``securityzone,'' which forms a buffer zone between northern Israelisettlements and Shiite and Palestinian guerrilla bases in Lebanon.   Last month, the commander of the Norwegian battalion comparedIsraeli army actions in south Lebanon to Nazi tactics in World WarII. Israel demanded his removal because of the comment.   Israel and a Christian-dominated militia it backs, the SouthLebanon Army, prevent UNIFIL from controlling much of the area insouthern Lebanon that it is supposed to watch over.   UNIFIL deploys about 5,800 men from Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana,Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Sweden.</TEXT></DOC>
