Theimpetus for this study is the need to define possible higher temperaturesuccessors for Rankine-based engines in solar central receiver powergenerating systems. Steam-injected gas turbine engines (denoted in whatfollows as &quot;STIG&quot;) and the more conventional regenerated-intercooled-reheatforms (denoted as &quot;IGT&quot;) are compared to simple Brayton cycles (denotedas &quot;GT&quot;) by computer modeling over a wide range of pertinent parameters.Attempts are made to represent the systems with realistic component performances.Results show that efficiencies were highest for the IGT followed by theSTIG and GT, respectively. Considerable improvements in specific workoutput were demonstrated by the STIG over both the IGT and GT systems.First Law analysis of the effect of turbine inlet temperature shows agradual increase of efficiency with turbine inlet temperature, with diminishingreturns at higher temperatures. Although there are significant practicalproblems associated with higher temperature applications, both in termsof engine and receiver considerations, they do not seem to be insurmountable.These results demonstrate reason for optimism about increased performancefor higher temperature air-based systems compared to Rankine systemsat presently used temperatures.</TEXT></DOC>
