The source models consideredcan represent excitation by external electromagnetic waves propagatingobliquely to the plasma density gradient, mode conversion of electrostaticwhistlers, beat of two transparent electromagnetic waves, and directconversion from ripples in the density profile. The calculation treatsthe Landau damping provided by fast-tail electrons self-consistentlyand is applicable to plasmas having a long density scale length L, i.e.,(k/sub D/L)/sup 1/3/ andgt;andgt;1, where k/sub D/ is the Debye wavenumber of thewarm background electrons. A threshold condition is found for the formationof a positive slope in the tail distribution by the various excitationmechanisms.</TEXT></DOC>
