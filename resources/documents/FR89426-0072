Justification  </ITAG><T3>1. Circumstances That Make the Collection of Information Necessary </T3>The objective of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Departmentof Labor, is to improve safety and health conditions in the mining industry.Mining traditionally has been, and remains, one of the most hazardous occupationsin the United States; the rate of fatal accidents in mining in 1986 (50per 100,000 workes) was five times the average rate (10 per 100,000) forall industries 1<NOTE/>. Any condition that increases the potential for accidentsis a matter of concern.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>1 <T3>Statistical Abstract of The United States 1988, </T3>U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Table No. 663, page 399.  It has long been recognized that the use and abuse of alcohol and drugsis a serious safety hazard at the work site, contributes to loss of production,and leads to increased absenteeism. Studies have shown that a worker whouses alcohol or drugs is three to four times more likely to have an accident,two and one-half times more likely to be absent, and 25 to 33 percent lessproductive than one who does not. Estimates of the loss to American industryand the economy due to alcohol and drug abuse range as high as $100 billionper year. Some experts estimate that as many as 20 to 25 percent of theAmerican workforce may be substance abusers. Substance abuse poses a particularsafety hazard in mining. The potential danger created by substance abusein the mining industry is so great that Federal law specifically prohibitsthe possession or use of alcohol or drugs at mine sites.  Unfortunately, there is little doubt that substance abuse continues tooccur in American mines; the extent to which it occurs is not only unknown,it tends to be hidden precisely because it is illegal. Even less is knownabout the efforts made by the mining industry to detect or treat substanceabuse. Previous studies of the question of substance abuse have been eithergeneric studies of all industries (e.g., the Gallup survey for Hoffmann-LaRoche2<NOTE/>), limited to specific substances (e.g., the recent Bureauof Labor Statistics survey on illicit drugs), or limited to a specificsegment of the industry (e.g., the Carnegie-Mellon study of undergroundbituminous coal mines). In short, we have little direct knowledge of eitherthe extent of substance abuse in the mining industry or the efforts thatmining companies and unions may be taking to counteract and treat alcoholand drug abuse.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>2 <T3>Drug Testing at Work: A Survey of American Corporations, </T3>conductedby The Gallup Organization 1988, Sponsored by Hoffmann-LaRoche, Nutley,N.J.  The problem does exist. In 1985, the interest in and reaction to a seriesof articles in an MSHA journal led concerned managers and union representativesin the mining industry to form a voluntary committee, The Mining IndustryCommittee on Substance Abuse, with a charter to assist owners, operators,and employees in the industry in their efforts to deal with the problem.In addition to management and union members, the Committee includes representativesfrom MSHA, the Bureau of Mines, and the National Institutes on Drug Abuse(NIDA) and Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA).This Committee, in cooperation with MSHA, has produced a video tape onsubstance abuse, published a manual on employee assistance programs, designedand distributed posters and warning stickers, and sponsored seminars andtraining sessions on the subject. Reaction in the industry to these effortshas been quite positive. At this time, however, Committee members believethat their efforts could be more beneficial and more productive if theywere more specifically targeted to actual conditions in the industry. Asidefrom the personal knowledge of the Committee members, and a variety ofanecdotal information, there is no way to obtain specific information otherthan through this proposed study.In addition to collecting information for MSHA and the Mining IndustryCommittee on Substance Abuse, the results of this study will be reportedto the Secretary of Labor for inclusion in the report to Congress mandatedby the Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-570). This information shouldsupplement the date on illegal drug detection and treatment collected byBLS in their survey of ten industries, including mining.2. Uses of InformationThis study is intended to provide the Mining Industry Committee on SubstanceAbuse and MSHA with more specific information about the number of minesites conducting substance abuse programs and training. The informationcollected through this study will be used to develop policies, procedures,and training initiatives regarding substance abuse in the mining industry.The study results will be reported to the Secretary of Labor for inclusionin the report to Congress. Copies of the study results will be given tothe Committee representatives from the National Institute on Drug Abuse,The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the Mine Safetyand Health Administration, the Bureau of Mines, and mining industry managementand union representatives for their use in the development and evaluationof substance abuse programs.Failure to conduct the proposed survey will result in the continued absenceof accurate information for the development of substance abuse programs,policies, and training programs for the mining industry.3. Uses of Improved Information TechnologyThe present state of automation in the mining industry precludes the useof improved information technology to reduce the burden on respondents.We have explored other possible applications of improved information technologyand have been unable to identify any feasible alternatives to the methodsto be used in this study. Respondents will be offered the option of replyingby telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission rather than in writing.4. Efforts to Identify DuplicationWe have been unable to identify any other sources of information whichinclude the scope of data needed for this study. Various studies are ongoingbut too limited in scope for our purposes. The most noteworthy of theseis the Bureau of Labor Statistics nationwide survey of employer anti-drugprograms (see discussion below, in paragraph 5). In addition to surveyingthe literature on this topic, we have contacted the U.S. Bureau of Mines,the Mine Health and Safety Academy, the AFL-CIO Occupational Alcohol Program,the Association of Labor-Management Administrators andamp; Consultants onAlcoholism (ALMACA), the National Association of State Alcohol and DrugAbuse Directors (NASADAD), the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol Information,the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Instituteon Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), as well as knowledgeable researcherson the subject. These contacts indicate that no comparable federal or privatesurvey or other source for this information exists. Therefore, there isno duplication of requested information.5. Reasons Existing Information Cannot Be UsedPrevious studies of the question of substance abuse have been either genericstudies of all industries, limited to a specific substance, or limitedto a specific segment of the industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recentlycompleted a survey of employer anti-drug programs, which provides dataon the prevalence of drug testing and rehabilitation programs and the numberof employees directly affected across the private sector of the U.S. economy.One of the ten industries included in that study is the mining industry,including oil and gas producers; the proposed MSHA study includes coal,metal, and non-metal mines, but not oil and gas producers. The BLS surveydoes provide some data similar to the data we are requesting, but it doesnot include data concerning abuse of alcohol or prescription drugs. Privateefforts to obtain information on employer drug abuse policies and programstend to be very limited, involving either case studies or surveys of Fortune500 firms, none of which can produce representative data for the miningindustry as a whole.6. Minimizing the Burden to Small EstablishmentsThe survey is directed toward a statistical sample of all active miningestablishments in the portion of the mining industry for which MSHA isresponsible (see Part B for a description of the sample and survey methodology).The BLS survey results indicated that over 75% of the mining industry,95.9% of establishments with 1 to 9 employees, and 86.6% of establishmentswith 10 to 49 employees had neither a drug-testing nor an employee assistanceprogram.\3\<NOTE/> On that basis, we anticipate that most small mining establishmentswill not have substance abuse programs, which will allow them to skip upto 33 of the 44 questions. To further minimize the response burden, respondentswill be offered the option of replying by telephone or FAX transmission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>Survey of Employer Anti-drug Programs, </T3>U.S. Department of Labor,Bureau of Labor Statistics, January 1989, Report 760; Tables 1 and 2, pp.6-7.The survey questionnaire has been pre-tested on eight (8) selected miningcompanies that volunteered to assist us. These companies answered all ofthe questions on the questionnaire, and reported that total time requiredto read all materials and answer all questions ranged from 10 minutes to25 minutes, with an average time of about 15 minutes. The total time requiredto complete the questionnaire by a mining company not having a substanceabuse program should be less than 10 minutes.7. Consequences of Less Frequent Data CollectionThe study will be conducted only once.8. Guidelines of 5 CFR 1320.6The study will not violate any of the provisions of these guidelines.9. Consultation With Outside Agencies Regarding the Availability of DataIn addition to the contracts mentioned in paragraph 4 above, we have discussedour study plans with the members of the Mining Industry Committee on SubstanceAbuse. They have offered some useful suggestions and have expressed interestin the results since the study is unique. We have also pre-tested the surveyinstrument, and modified those questions that could not be answered withoutfurther research.10. Confidentiality AssurancesAssuring the confidentiality of the data obtained has been a primary concernin developing the methods to be used in this study, and has directly affectedthe design of the questionnaire. Mine operators believe there may be legaland regulatory implications to revealing specific information about substanceabuse in their operations, particularly if their corrective actions maybe considered inadequate. In addition to the sensitivity of the subjectmatter (substance abuse), some concerns have been raised about revealinginformation concerning union representation (or the lack of representation)to a committee containing union members.To protect the respondents, the statistics will be compiled by an independentoutside contractor and will be reported in summary form only. The returnedquestionnaires will be destroyed (shredded) after data entry and individualrespondent company names will not be entered to the data base or directlyassociated with the data.11. Sensitive QuestionsWithin the mining industry, there is sensitivity and resistance to anykind of government data collection and to questions concerning unionizationof the industry. We have attempted to address these questions by conductingthe survey through an independent outside contractor, and preventing thedata in summary form only.12.

Estimated ReportingBurdenThe survey will be mailed to a sample of 3,600 mining companies. The averageresponse time will be 10 minutes. If all 3,600 companies respond, the totalreporting burden will be about 600 hours. An anticipated response rateof 80% would result in a reporting burden of only 480 hours.14. Change in BurdenThere are 12,600 hours in the Information Collection Budget for this researchproject. This estimate was based on the use of two questionnaires, with100% of the 18,000 mining operations responding to the first questionnaireand 20%, or 3600, being asked to answer a second more detailed questionnaire.Since the time the Information Collection Budget was prepared, the agencydecided to use the approach described in this submission, involving a statisticalsurvey of a scientifically selected sample of mining companies, to collectthe information. Thus the anticipated burden has been reduced to 480 hours.15. Plans for Tabulation, Statistical Use, and PublicationThe study based on the questionnaire attached as Appendix A will be conductedas soon as possible following OMB clearance. Data will be tabulated andanalyzed, and report submitted to MSHA management by June 26, 1989. Thesurvey results will be tabulated by mine type, commodity mined, and mineemployment size class, and presented as statistical summaries, counts,and percentages. Separate tabulations will be made for these categories,along with national totals. While the final report will be available uponrequest, it is intended primarily for internal agency use, and will notbe published as a public document.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Collection of Information Employing Statistical Methods</ITAG>1 a. UniverseThe universe for this survey will consist of all the approximately 17,000active mining establishments reporting employment to MSHA in 1988. Contractorsare not included. These establishments comprise all those with 1977 StandardIndustrial Classification 111 or 121 (coal); 101-106, 109, or 281 (metal);131, 145, 147, 149, 289, or 299 (non-metal); 141, 142, 324, or 327 (stone);and 144 (sand andamp; gravel). b. Sample SizeThe probability sampling plan to be used in the survey is designed to producereliable estimates of the proportion of establishments falling into a givencategory delineated on the questionnaire and of the proportion of employeesworking at such establishments. Separate estimates are needed for eachof the mining groups listed above, as well as for establishments roughlycomparable in size. The total number of establishments required to achievea reasonable level of reliability is calculated to be 3,600. This allowsfor an overall non-response rate of 20 percent and non-response of about50 percent.2 a. Sample DesignThe sampling frame will be stratified into 16 strata, comprising four employmentsize categories for coal, metal, and non-metal, and two size categoriesfor stone and for sand and gravel. Within these strata, geographic locationwill be randomly allocated but a state code will be recorded as a potentiallysignificant covariate and to enable comparisons among broad regions. Tomaximize efficiency in estimating the number and proportion of employeesat establishments falling into categories specified on the questionnaire,larger establishments will have a greater probability of being includedin the sample than smaller ones. Sampling ratios will range from near certaintyfor mines in the largest employment-size category to approximately tenpercent in the smallest. Within each stratum, sampling will be random.b. Estimation ProcedureFor each stratum, a probability design based estimator_in which each unitof the sample is weighted by the inverse of the sampling ratio for itsstratum_will be used to estimate totals of establishments for various characteristicsof interest. Using total employment reported to MSHA for each stratum,<T3>ratio estimators </T3>will be used to estimate employee totals at theseestablishments. Estimates of totals at higher tabulation levels will bethe sum of the subsumed stratum estimates. At each level of tabulation,proportions will be calculated as the ratio of the appropriate totals.Standard errors will be calculated for all estimates of totals and proportions.c. AccuracySample sizes for the individual industry strata were calculated to meeta criterion of +/^ three percentage points at 95-percent confidence inestimating a proportion of 25 percent. Precision for estimates of proportionsof establishments and employees for selected aggregations is anticipatedto be roughly as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10,10</C> <H1>Aggregation level</H1><H1>Relative standard error of_</H1><H2>Proportion of employees (percent)</H2><H2>Proportion of establishments (percent)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Employment-size <D>5 </D><D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Industry <D>9 </D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Industry X size <D>14 </D><D>9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total <D>3 </D><D>2</D></ITAG></ITAG>d. ProblemsThere are no unusual problems requiring specialized sampling procedures.e. FrequencyThis is a one-time survey.3 a. ResponseTo maximize the response rate for this survey, employers will be givena pledge of confidentiality and an explanation of the importance of thesurvey. A follow-up mailing will be made to the non-respondents of theinitial mailing.b. Nonresponse AdjustmentWithin each of the 16 primary strata, supplemented by geographic stratadefined by state codes if necessary, a non-response adjustment factor willbe calculated and used, along with the stratum's sampling ratio, to weightthe results for that stratum.c. ReliabilityProbability sampling methodology will be used in the design and analysisof the survey to control and estimate sampling errors.d. TestsA limited pre-test of the survey instrument was completed by eight voluntarymining companies. Modifications were made to the survey instrument, basedon their responses and suggestions.e. Statistical ResponsibilityThis survey is directed and managed by Tom Brown, Public Affairs Specialist,Office of Information and Public Affairs, MSHA (235-1452).

All company employees,from the board room to the tool room, are included. 3. <T3>What is ``Substance Abuse''? </T3>As used in this survey, it is theuse of alcohol or any legal or illegal drug, including prescription andover-the-counter drugs, in such a way as to affect or potentially affectan individual's performance or threaten the safety of others on the job.This survey does <T3>not </T3>include use of tobacco or tobacco products. 4. <T3>What drugs are included? </T3>Any substance ingested, inhaled, injected,or absorbed that causes or may cause a change in behavior, either as astimulant, depressant, or hallucinogen. It includes, but is not limitedto, alcohol, over-the-counter or prescription pain medication (codeine,Demerol), tranquilizers (Valium), diet pills, heart or diabetes medication(Enderal), amphetamines, barbiturarates (Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbitol),or illicit drugs such as heroin (smack), cocaine (crack or coke), marijuana,hashish, methamphetamines, or hallucinogens (PCP, LSD, peyote). 5. <T3>What is an ``Employee Assistance Program''? </T3>Any workplace policy,procedure, or program intended to provide counselling, advise, or assistanceto employees who experience personal situations or problems that directlyor indirectly affect their work performance. The program may be sponsoredand administered by the company, the union, or another party, may be conductedon-site or off-site, may include inpatient or outpatient services, or maybe provided by contractual agreement with outside private or communitysources. The program may provide assistance in a variety of personal (financial,martial, mental health, legal) problems, or be directed at more limitedsituations such as alcohol or drug abuse. Dependents may be included insome programs. Some programs may be known by other names, such as HelpPrograms or Wellness Programs. This survey is directed specifically atidentifying programs, regardless of name, that include some form of attentionto substance abuse problems, whether alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or both.6. <T3>Will my response be kept confidential? </T3>Yes. The data will be compiledand analyzed by an independent management consulting firm, Technical Assistanceand Training Corporation (TATC). All answers to the questionnaries willbe tabulated without identifying the respondent companies, and the questionnaireswill be destroyed as soon as the responses are entered to the computerdatabase. TATC will present their findings in summary form to the MineSafety and Health Administration and the Mining Industry Committee on SubstanceAbuse. Your company will not be identified in any way in the final report.7. <T3>My mine site is owned by a parent company, and uses the same personnelpolicies. Should I respond to the questionnaire? </T3>Yes. Your mine sitehas been selected in a random selection process, which may or may not includeyour parent company or other mine sites owned by the same company. Youranswers represent all other mining companies/mines that are about the samesize, in the same general geographical area, and have operations similarto your. We want to try to determine whether practices and experiencesare affected by local conditions, such as the availability of counsellingor treatment programs.8. <T3>Is there a difference between a ``drug testing'' and a ``drug screening''program? </T3>Technically, there is a distinction between testing and screening.For the purposes of this survey, however, we are only interested in determiningwhether your company uses any systematic methods for determining whetheran individual is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or for detectingthe presence of drug byproducts in the blood, urine, saliva, hair or otherbodily substance of an individual. Drug testing programs normally requirecollection of samples in a controlled environment, for subsequent laboratoryanalysis; drug screening programs my include non-intrusive methods, suchas breathalyzers, observation of eye movement and reactions, or unusualbehaviour patterns.9. <T3>How can I get copies of the survey results? </T3>The final survey reportshould be available by the middle of 1989. Address your requests for copiesto the Office of Information and Public Affairs, Mine Safety and HealthAdministration, U.S. Department of Labor, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, Room 601,Arlington, VA 22203.10. <T3>How can I find out more about the Mining Industry Committee on SubstanceAbuse? </T3>The Mining Industry Committee on Substance Abuse is a voluntaryassociation of representatives from mining management, labor unions, andinvolved Federal government agencies, formed in 1985 to assist the owners,operators, and employees in the mining industry in their efforts to dealwith the issues of alcohol and drug abuse. While our activities have beensupported by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), of the Departmentof Labor, we are not an official government committee.In the past three years, the Committee, in cooperation with MSHA, has takenseveral positive actions aimed at educating mining industry managers andemployees about substance abuse. Together, we have produced and distributeda video tape on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse, a manual on establishingand managing Employee Assistance Programs (EAP), and anti-abuse postersand stickers, and conducted regional seminars on substance abuse.If you would like more information about our activities, please contacteither of the Committee Co-Chairman, Mr. James Wilcox, IMC Corporation(telephone 505-887-2871), or Mr. Frank Fantauzzo, Appalachian Council,AFL-CIO (telephone 304-345-5811).
