Areas of interest were localized usinga 20-30-slice, 20{sup 0} to 40{sup 0} tip angle, 50-150-msec repetitiontime, 5-msec echo time (TE) (FLASH) study, sequentially gated throughthe cardiac cycle. Subtractions of maximum dephased systolic and diastolicstudies produced arteriographic images. Evaluation of arterial structureswas facilitated by a small-field-of-view, 20-30-mm anisotropic 3D volumeset. Rephasing was facilitated by fast low-angle scans (TE, 10-14msec)with velocity and/or velocity and acceleration gradient compensationschemes. Similar scans with dephasing gradients were obtained and subtracted.These high-resolution, small-field-of-view studies will be discussedand compared with digital subtraction angiograms and film-screen arteriograms.</TEXT></DOC>
