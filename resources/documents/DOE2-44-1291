It is necessary for estimating the manufacturing costof shale oil to pay attention to the specific conditions of the projectsuch as characteristics of mineral deposit, geographical features, qualityof shale oil and financing cost. The manufacturing cost of shale oilby the dry distillation process using the oil shale from Fushun Minewas calculated. The result indicates that the estimated costs of shaleoil at a production rate of 17,300 b.p.d. are $13/bbl in Fushun and $23/bblin new developed Mao Ming, which are lower than expected. The actualcost by a commercial plant will be little higher than those values becausethe cost for the infrastructure will be required. Assuming that the shaleoil is used as an alternative to crude oil, the project will be implementedin the 21th century, because the estimated manufacturing cost of shaleoil is approximately ?30/bfl.
