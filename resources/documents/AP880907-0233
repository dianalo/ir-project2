Kelly, but two proteges of the Beatrice Co.chairman say they also plan to actively manage their newly acquiredStiffel Co. _ as they add to it.   James M. Snodgrass said Tuesday he and Steven S. Lindblad are``a little more operationally oriented and a little less dealmakingoriented'' than Kelly.   They plan to prove it as chairman and vice-chairman,respectively, of Stiffel, a Chicago-based manufacturer ofbrass-plated lamps formerly owned by Beatrice.   ``We both want to grow The Stiffel Co. and do other acquisitionsbut we want to be more involved in running the business,''Snodgrass said in a telephone interview.   Snodgrass and Lindblad did not disclose the amount theirinvestor group paid to buy Stiffel from American Brands Inc.   American Brands, based in Greenwich, Conn., acquired Stiffelearlier this year in its $2.7 billion purchase of Stiffel's parent,E-II Holdings Inc., a Beatrice offshoot also headed at the time byKelly.   Snodgrass, 51, said one reason he and Lindblad chose Stiffel astheir first acquisition was that, as former executives of Beatriceand E-II, they already had some knowledge of the company'soperations.   The 50-year-old Stiffel has about 500 employees, he said.   The men said Kelly, who will resign as chairman of Chicago-basedBeatrice effective Oct. 1, played no direct role in their venture.   But Snodgrass and Lindblad, who met while working for Kelly atEsmark Inc. in the early 1970s, acknowledged his influence on thisnew direction in their professional lives.   ``I suppose, since I worked for the man from 1971 forward, if Iwasn't influenced by him I'd be kind of dumb,'' Snodgrass said. ``Isuppose the common tie is the entrepreneurial orientation that DonKelly brought to Beatrice for those of us who worked for him.''   Lindblad, 48, said he and Snodgrass absorbed lessons inconglomerate-building during their 15 years of working togetherunder Kelly.   ``We have both done a lot of acquisitions and corporatedivestment work in that period of time and it can't help but havesome rub-off,'' he said.   Snodgrass and Lindblad stayed with Esmark for about a year afterBeatrice acquired it for $2.8 billion in 1984, leaving Kelly on theoutside.   In 1986, Kelly won a takeover of Beatrice, taking the companyprivate in a $6.2 billion deal backed by the New York buyout firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Snodgrass and Lindblad came back onboard later that year.   Snodgrass served as executive vice president of BCI HoldingsCorp. and president of Beatrice Consumer Durables Group, a non-fooddivision that went public as a part of E-II in 1987 with Stiffel asone of its holdings. Kelly made Snodgrass president and chiefexecutive officer of E-II Consumer Products Co., E-II's majoroperating subsidiary.   Lindblad served with Snodgrass as senior vice president andchief financial officer of E-II Consumer Products. Before that, heheld the same titles in the Beatrice Consumer Durables Group.</TEXT></DOC>
