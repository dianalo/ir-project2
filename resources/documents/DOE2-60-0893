Both could have considerable potential in thedifferent types of island community. Thermal applications include domesticwater and space heating, distillation, cooling and refrigeration; thetechnology associated with these is outlined. The conversion of solarenergy into electric energy through the medium of the photovoltaic cellis described and the cost of and island market for various applicationsof photovoltaics is examined. For most island communities these includesystems for lighting, water pumping, refrigeration, TV and general villageelectrification. Solar energy is already being used successfully in manydifferent applications in islands throughout the world but considerableopportunities exist for further expansion. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
