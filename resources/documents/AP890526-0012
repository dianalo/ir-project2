Pierce, who is now a New York lawyer, told congressionalinvestigators Thursday that he wasn't directly involved in decidingwhich projects received grants under the program. He said acommittee of his subordinates at the Department of Housing andUrban Development selected the winners, and his approval was arubber stamp.   Pierce said he wasn't influenced by well-connected Republicansand former HUD officials who obtained a large portion of themultimillion dollar subsidy projects, acting as consultants ordevelopers.   ``Perhaps we should have watched the program closer than wedid,'' Pierce said, in the closest he came to acknowledging anyblame. ``But we've got a whole department (to run) ....''   Pierce's appearance before a House Government Operationssubcommittee marked his first public comment since an investigativereport sharply criticized the management of a HUD program thatprovided indirect subsidies for rehabilitation of privately ownedlow-income housing projects.   Current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has suspended further awardsunder the program pending a review.   Pierce, who headed HUD for eight years under former PresidentReagan, testified that he recommended Congress kill the so-calledmod-rehab program.   But his remarks stirred strong reaction among members of thesubcommittee, which questioned him for more than two hours.   When Pierce suggested that Democrats had also profited from theprogram, a near-shouting match erupted with Rep. Barney Frank. TheMassachusetts Democrat charged that Pierce was trying to ``deflectsome of the blame'' by making ``irresponsible statements'' he couldnot back up.   At one point during their exchange, Pierce said, ``I don't think...'' and did not complete his sentence. Frank shot back, ``Well,that has been clearer and clearer.''   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., told Pierce thesuggestion that the Republican-appointed inspector general wasprotecting Democrats was ``difficult to fathom.''   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., told Pierce that despite eightyears in the Cabinet job, his remarks suggested ``you don't reallytoday understand how this program works.''   ``I did not have hands on,'' Pierce responded.   HUD Inspector General Paul Adams said an audit he conductedfound a pattern in which former department officials and otherwell-connected Republicans received an inordinately large share ofproject awards. Among those cited was former Interior SecretaryJames Watt, who was reported receiving a $300,000 consulting fee ona Maryland project.   Pierce acknowledged that department officials used their owndiscretion in awarding subsidies, but said that was becauseCongress in 1984 waived requirements specifying fair-shareallocation procedures.   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., read from a memothat he said the inspector general sent Pierce in 1988 warning himof problems in the program.   Pierce said by then he had altered the selection process. Hesaid he did not respond to the inspector general's suggestionbecause those changes needed time to work.   ``The inspector general is not God,'' Pierce said.   Rep. Margaret Roukema, R-N.J., and the subcommittee's chairman,Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., expressed surprise at Pierce's reactionto Adams' memo _ which Lantos called ``a very, very dramaticrecommendation.''   Pierce responded that he did not remember the memo, and added,``Well, there were a lot of fights going on.''   Pierce said he met with Watt on the Maryland project butreferred him to the appropriate office at HUD and told him that``we'd look very carefully at his project.''   ``No promises were made to him,'' Pierce said.</TEXT></DOC>
