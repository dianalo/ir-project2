The productivity of workers not engaged in farming rose ata 1.9% annual rate in the second quarter, the LaborDepartment said. The April through June rise in nonfarmproductivity, the amount produced for each hour worked, wasthe result of an increase in output at a 1.3% annual ratecombined with a decline in hours at a 0.5% pace.</LP><TEXT>   In the first quarter, productivity fell at an annual rateof 1.1%, the department said, revised from the 0.4% rate ofdecline originally reported.   Because productivity grew faster than output, economistssaid some employers apparently were still slashing their workforces despite signs that the economy might be improving.   Also, even if business is picking up, some employers maybe leery about adding new workers because they feel therecovery won't be strong.   &quot;These are very nice numbers, especially in themanufacturing sector, but firms are still shedding labor. So,I'm not ready to say the recession is over yet,&quot; said RichardBelous, senior economist with National Planning Association,a business and labor research group here.   Productivity gains were strongest in the manufacturingsector, rising at a 3.6% annual rate.   The figures are adjusted for normal season variations.</TEXT></DOC>
