Reports said Bulgarian authorities imposed emergency measures tostifle ethnic Turks who are resisting an assimilation campaign. Thepresident, speaking on television and radio, made no reference tosuch measures.   But he accused Turkey, as well as Western ``circles'' and radiostations, of an anti-Bulgarian campaign.   He also told Turkish authorities: ``Open your frontier to allBulgarian Moslems who want to go to Turkey for a short-term stay orfor permanent residence.''   Even before riots mainly in northern Bulgaria a week ago, theSofia government began deporting ethnic Turks deemed to betroublemakers or otherwise undesirable.   An estimated 300 of them have been forced to flee, mostly toVienna, Austria, and Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Scores have been pickedup by Turkish airliners for resettlement in Turkey. More Turks werearriving in Vienna and Belgrade on Monday, Turkish diplomats said.   Turkish refugee sources in Belgrade said Monday that theemergency measures in Bulgaria confine ethnic Turks around theBlack Sea port of Varna to their homes at night.   They also said radio broadcasts from neighboring Turkey arebeing jammed and all mosques in the area have been closed. Policehave forbidden more than two people from walking together in thestreets of the largely Turkish-populated towns, they said.   The deportees declined to be identified for fear of reprisalsagainst relatives in Bulgaria.   According to an official report, three people died in the recentethnic unrest in Bulgaria, but deportees have put the figure at upto 30. The violence flared during demonstrations for restoration ofethnic Turkish rights, according to diplomatic and exile sources.   A nationwide drive, begun in 1984, forced the estimated 900,000Bulgarian Turks to change their Moslem names to Slavic andrestricted their religious and civil rights, such as public use oftheir language.   The Bulgarian government does not recognize the Turkishminority. It says the people targeted by the campaign are actuallySlavs who were converted to Islam during five centuries of Ottomanoccupation.   Several Western nations have said they will raise the issue at a35-nation human rights conference starting in Paris on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
