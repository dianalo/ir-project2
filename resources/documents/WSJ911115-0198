As a result, the co-op projectshave defaulted on their underlying mortgages, threatening theequity of co-op owners.   The cases have brought the Resolution Trust Corporation'seffort to minimize taxpayer losses in direct conflict withattempts by solvent lenders to limit real estate losses.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It seems to me that the RTC is becoming part of theproblem, not the solution,&quot; complains Stuart Saft, who isrepresenting the co-op boards of two New York City projectsthat the RTC has pushed into default.   Purchasers of co-operative apartments buy stock in acorporation, which entitles them to live in a certaindwelling. Their monthly maintenance payments help pay theco-op's underlying mortgage. A mortgage default threatens theequity of all shareholders.   The RTC takeover in February of Coreast Savings Bank,Richmond, Va., whose principal shareholder is New York realestate investor Arthur Cohen, left the agency with unsoldshares of co-operative projects in Brooklyn, Queens, andUnion City and Voorhese, N.J.   It is the first time the RTC has acquired large ownershippositions in co-op projects, but it expects more such casesto arise.   &quot;What we can't do is throw good money after bad,&quot; saysLamar Kelly, the RTC's deputy executive director, inexplaining non-payment of maintenance fees. &quot;It really is anunfortunate situation&quot; for co-op owners. &quot;But the RTC wouldbe shifting money from the taxpayers pockets and subsidizingthe lenders and co-op owners&quot; if it made the payments.   This isn't a new situation for the RTC. Half-completeddevelopments are often found in the portfolios of bustedthrifts, and the agency must determine whether to cut offfunding and liquidate, or bet that future values will make itworthwhile to commit the necessary time and money -- oftenmillions of dollars -- to see projects through to the finish.When projects deemed uneconomic aren't completed, it almostalways angers other investors. But the RTC says that it orits contractors restructure bad loans about twice as often asthey foreclose and liquidate.   When the RTC stopped making payments on Coreast's morethan 240 unsold units of a 305-unit co-op in Union City, ittriggered the co-op's default on a $9.8 million loan fromAmerican Savings Bank, White Plains, N.Y. About a dozen co-opowners have since walked away from their investments.   A 680-unit co-operative apartment project in Vorheesdefaulted on a $23 million loan to American Savings for thesame reason, after the RTC took over from Coreast shares onabout 515 unsold units. The RTC offered to surrender itsshares to the bank, but not without a release from allliabilities, according to Edward Philips, senior vicepresident at the bank. The bank rejected the offer becausethe agency didn't itemize potential liabilities, and plans tomove in state court today to seize the co-op shares and land.   Mr. Kelly said that because the property was onlyappraised at $16.2 million, the RTC stood to lose anyadditional money it put into the project.   &quot;We find it's caused a tremendous amount of problems forus,&quot; says Mr. Philips. In March, American Savings signed aconsent decree with bank regulators calling for it toincrease capital levels and reduce non-performing assets. &quot;Togo this long without debt service or the ability to sell theunits is a tremendous burden,&quot; said Mr. Philips.   When the RTC took over the unsold shares in two New Yorkco-ops from Coreast, it also stopped payments. But it neveroffered to give up the shares, according to Mr. Saft, whorepresents the two co-op boards. The RTC believes it couldrecover a substantial amount of money, says Mr. Saft, if someof the units weren't occupied by renters paying below-marketrents under the city's rent-control laws.   On a 180-unit co-op project in Queens, the RTC hassurrendered its half-ownership of shares in about 100 unitsin exchange for a portion of future profits. Mr. Saft isattempting to negotiate a similar deal on a project inBrooklyn, where the RTC has part-ownership of 87 units.</TEXT></DOC>
