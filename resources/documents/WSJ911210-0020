Heating oil led the price plunge. In heavy U.S. trading,the futures price of heating oil for January delivery dropped2.70 cents to 54.44 cents a gallon. In London, futures pricesof gas oil, Europe's version of the fuel, were down as muchas $8 a metric ton.</LP><TEXT>   The fall in heating oil contributed to declines in otherfuels. Gasoline for January delivery was 1.74 cents lower at53.26 cents a gallon.   The futures price of January crude oil fell 62 cents tosettle at $19.42 a barrel. That was an eight-month low forthe so-called prompt crude on the New York MercantileExchange.   Traders and analysts attributed the price drops to bulginginventories of heating oil and crude oil. This has led to amarked change in oil-market psychology in recent weeks. Asrecently as October, there was much concern that heating oilwould be in tight supply, particularly if winter proved to besevere, because of anticipated declines in fuel exports bythe former Soviet Union.   But such fears are dissipating. Fuel tanks are brimful inboth the U.S. and in Europe. In the U.S., the latest industrytally of fuel inventories showed more than 140 millionbarrels of heating oil in storage, up from 132.9 million ayear ago. A new report, for last week's inventory total, willbe released by the American Petroleum Institute after futurestrading ends today.   &quot;There is plenty of product,&quot; said John Maniscalco,executive vice president of the New York Oil HeatingAssociation. As a result, he added, &quot;we are likely to see asoft market all winter.&quot;   Still, some analysts hold out the prospect that oilmarkets could firm again before winter is over.   &quot;The weakness in the price of oil has been somewhatunexpected, resulting from the weakness of world demand,ample supplies of oil and a negative market psychology ofexpected excess crude oil availability,&quot; said FereidunFesharaki, director of resource programs at Honolulu'sEastWest Center. But he added: &quot;Any detailed examination ofthe market supports higher prices.&quot; He predicted prices ofWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, will riseto $24 or $25 a barrel in the 1992 first quarter.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of hog futures contractsdipped amid continued disappointment that the recent U.S.food aid package to the Soviet Union didn't includesignificant amounts of pork. The biggest organization of U.S.hog farmers had been lobbying the White House to allocatesome U.S. government-backed loan guarantees for the Sovietsto buy an amount of pork equal to roughly one day'sproduction by U.S. meatpackers. Hog prices have been weakbecause farmers are rapidly expanding the size of their herdsat the same time when poultry and beef supplies are alsorising. Prices of cattle futures contracts rose in quiettrading. Some livestock analysts expect prices of choicesteers to remain relatively weak for the rest of month.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose sharply as the disintegrationof the Soviet Union increased uncertainty about the fate ofthe Cuban sugar crop. The March contract opened at 8.75 centsa pound, its low for the day, and closed at 9.09 cents, only0.01 cent off the day's high, up 0.26 cent. According toHarry Schwartz, a soft-commodity analyst at Cargill InvestorsServices in New York, a Cuban delegation is now in Moscowtrying to negotiate the terms of next year's swap of sugarfor energy products. He said that in recent years the termshave become steadily less favorable to the Cubans. &quot;Two yearsago they {the Cubans} received 13 million metric tons ofpetroleum products for their sugar, last year they received10 million tons and this year they will be lucky to receivethree million tons,&quot; Mr. Schwartz said. He added that thereare rumors that the harvest has begun and also rumors that ithasn't because of a lack of fuel. He said that some of themajor sugar houses have estimated that the Cuban harvest willbe down only 300,000 tons or so to about seven million tons,a figure he termed optimistic. Mr. Schwartz noted that someanalysts initially believed that much of the Cuban sugarwouldn't go to the Soviet Union but would find its way to theworld market, which depressed prices; but now some of theseanalysts are realizing that without fuel supplies there maybe no Cuban harvest at all. That realization, Mr. Schwartzadded, has turned the market bullish.                                                                                                          COCOA: Prices declined mostly due to uncertainty aboutevents in the Soviet Union. The March contract ended $19 aton lower at $1,265. The market has been held in check,according to Mr. Schwartz of Cargill, by two factors: therecession in the U.S. reducing demand for chocolate, andreduced buying by the Soviets because they are unable to payfor imports. He noted that in the recent past the Soviets hadpurchased about 170,000 metric tons but in the crop yearended Sept. 30, 1991, they bought only 60,000 tons. But headded it is now a foregone conclusion that the 1991-92 worldcrop will be the first in several years to be smaller thanthe preceding crop. &quot;This decline is due to the world's cocoatrees being beyond their prime fruit-bearing years,&quot; he said,noting that it will take four years before newly plantedtrees will begin bearing fruit. Mr. Schwartz said the markethas rallied strongly since Dec. 2, when it was at $1,225 aton, reaching $1,300 a week later. He added that he expectsthe market to remain in a trading range between $1,200 and$1,300 until the direction of the U.S. economy becomesclearer and political events in Eastern Europe stabilize.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Prices fell as speculators and commodityfunds sold in apparent disappointment over the warm weatherin Florida last weekend. The March contract settled at$1.6295 a pound, off 3.30 cents. Celeste Georgakis, an orangejuice analyst in New York for Cargill Investors Services,said that because the market went almost straight up ithasn't created price ranges where the market would besupported in sell-offs. She expects to see major support inthe $1.55-to-$1.56 area. She pointed out that during thecurrent decline, orange juice dealers were buyers. She alsonoted that futures prices are now below cash prices, whichprovides additional incentive for juice dealers to be buyers.Ms. Georgakis said that traders look for damaging freezes inFlorida between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15 but that so far theweather has been unusually mild. Michael Palmerino, ameteorologist at Weather Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass.,said that though the weather has been mild it is too early torule out the possibility of a severe freeze in Florida. &quot;Nextweek will definitely be colder than this week,&quot; he added, buta damaging freeze usually cannot be forecast until just twoor three days in advance. He pointed out that the weather onthe East Coast has been swinging from unseasonably warm tounseasonably cold, a pattern that can lead to problems forthe Florida crop. Ms. Georgakis said traders have reached noconsensus on the coming Brazil crop. She noted that thepossibility of quality problems with Brazil's fruit will helpto keep prices stable. She expects the cash market to be firmuntil after mid-January.</TEXT></DOC>
