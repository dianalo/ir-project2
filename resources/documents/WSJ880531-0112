This development -- disclosed by Issam Abdul Rahim Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, in an interview -- renews the possibility that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may yet come to terms with last month's invitation by non-OPEC exporters to establish a joint effort to trim the world oil glut.    &quot;If there is going to be an agreement between OPEC's 12 (other) members and non-OPEC, it's natural we would be a party,&quot; Mr. Al-Chalabi said in the interview before his return this past weekend to Baghdad.    As previously reported, the oil minister was here last week at the invitation of U.S. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington for discussions with government and oil-company officials regarding Iraq's burgeoning oil industry. In speeches in Washington and in Houston and in his talks with U.S. officials, Mr. Al-Chalabi called attention to Iraq's enormous oil reserves and its increasing production capacity, which he estimates at four million barrels a day.    In the talks, Mr. Al-Chalabi also underscored Iraq's unwillingness to return to the OPEC quota system unless it received an allotment equal to the 2.36 million barrels a day of its war foe, Iran. He also indicated on several occasions that Iraq's production would remain higher than that amount unless OPEC agreed to take it back into the quota system on parity with Iran. Industry estimates place Iraq's current output at 2.5 million barrels a day.    But in the interview, Mr. Al-Chalabi said Iraq would be &quot;prepared to share&quot; in any joint production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC exporters. At a consultative meeting a month ago, OPEC oil ministers failed to agree on a counterproposal to the non-OPEC offer of coordinated production cuts, largely because of the objections of several Arab producing countries which support Iraq in its war against Iran. But under the counterproposals then discussed, Iraq would have been excluded.    OPEC is expected to renew discussions on the non-OPEC offer at its next meeting, which is scheduled to begin in Vienna June 8. Iraq's exclusion from the current quota system also will be on the agenda -- and a prominent issue -- at that meeting.    Mr. Al-Chalabi said, however, that he hasn't been having any discussions with the other OPEC ministers regarding a production quota for Iraq. &quot;Why waste time?&quot; he asked, adding: &quot;They know our exact position; we won't deviate from it, and it is up to the rest to accept it.&quot;    The Iraqi minister said there is &quot;a good chance&quot; the 12 others in OPEC will agree to Iraq's quota position. But if not, he said, &quot;we will keep in line&quot; with whatever decision OPEC may make regarding the non-OPEC proposal. </TEXT></DOC>
