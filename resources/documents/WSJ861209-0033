Garcia</HL><DD> 12/09/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices were lifted from their lows by a brief late-afternoon rally yesterday, but it wasn't followed by strong investor buying and the market closed mixed.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a decline of more than 13 points around midday. But stock prices began moving higher as the bond market headed upward. Buy programs, linked to various stock-index futures trading strategies, extended the rally in the stock market and by 3:30 p.m. EST, the industrial average was up more than 15 points.    Traders said the flurry resulted from the buy programs and some purchases by professionals to cover &quot;short&quot; positions where they had previously sold borrowed shares. But traders said they saw little aggressive demand from institutional investors.    So the rally fizzled and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session up 5.20 at 1930.26. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index eased 0.01 to 251.16, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.10 to 143.59.    Declining issues outpaced advancing issues on the Big Board, 898 to 672. Volume rose to 159 million shares from 139.8 million shares Friday.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average dropped 7.18 to 853.69, its second consecutive decline. The average had continued to roll ahead last week after the industrial average ran out of steam following last Tuesday's 43-point leap to a record.    Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said yesterday's brief rally &quot;promotes a lot of skepticism&quot; about prospects for a continued market advance &quot;because of the narrow leadership&quot; of this fall's rally.    He noted that since late September, when the industrial average hit its recent low of about 1755, the rebound has been &quot;basically a blue-chip move.&quot; He added that the high-quality character of the rally got more emphasis after the mid-November news of the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.    Michael O'Higgins, a money manager based in Albany, N.Y., said the stock market has been deteriorating for more than seven months. He said that while the industrial average hit a record last Tuesday, the Value Line index, made up of both blue-chips and smaller-capitalization stocks, was 5.2% below its May 29 peak of 246.80. This divergence &quot;has never been good,&quot; he said, adding that at some point he expects the blue-chip indexes will join the decline.    Yesterday, secondary stocks moved lower. The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index fell 0.88 to 266.78. The Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 1.95 to 361.01 as volume contracted to 110.6 million shares from 133.3 million shares Friday. There were 783 issues advancing and 1,370 declining.    Gainers mostly were a haphazard array, rarely encompassing a whole industry group.    In the technology sector, Digital Equipment gained 3 to 108 3/8. Cowen andamp; Co. raised its estimates of Digital's 1987 and 1988 earnings.    International Business Machines gained 1 1/8 to 127 3/4; Texas Instruments moved up 2 1/4 to 123 1/2; and Cray Research gained 1/2 to 81 1/2. But there were some losers in this sector as well: Honeywell slid 1 5/8 to 65 1/4 and Unisys dropped 1/4 to 84 1/8.    In the aerospace group, Rockwell moved up 1 1/8 to 44 5/8. But Lockheed fell 1 to 53 1/2; McDonnell Douglas dropped 3/4 to 75 1/2; Boeing lost 3/8 to 51 1/2; and Northrop slid 7/8 to 40 5/8.    Amoco closed down 1/2 at 64 3/4 after trading as low as 63. The company told analysts Friday that its domestic reserves could fall 5% this year and oil production could decline 5% to 7% next year.    Oil stocks started out on a weak note. A story in yesterday's Wall Street Journal said that abundant oil inventories might hinder the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to raise crude prices. The late-afternoon rally lifted oil stocks from their lows, and some issues ended slightly lower on the day, while others showed small gains.    British Gas American depositary shares closed at 9 1/8, down 1/4 from 9 3/8 where they began trading in the secondary market, but well above the $7.11 per share price of yesterday's initial public offering in the U.S. More than 16.6 million depositary shares of Britian's formerly state-owned natural gas utility were offered. Each depositary share represents 10 of the concern's ordinary common shares.    British Gas's U.S. issue was the mostactive on the Big Board, with more than 9.3 million shares changing hands.    Nicholas Bannister, a vice president with S.G. Warburg in New York, said the issue moved to a higher-than-expected premium because of strong institutional demand, coming mostly from index funds. He said the jumbo offering of over four billion ordinary common shares in England, the largest public offering in history, represented about 2% of the stock market in London at the offering price.    Those in the Wall Street community who play the deal stocks were dealt a severe blow. Carter Hawley Hale traded as high as 57 1/2 after Retail Partners sweetened its bid for the retailing concern to $60 a share from $55. But it closed at 47 1/2, down 5 7/8 on the day, after Carter rejected the sweetened offer.    General Cinema fell 1 7/8 to 45. The company, which already owns preferred stock that is convertible into 38.6% of Carter's common, said it had signed an agreement with Carter, allowing it to raise its stake to 50.1%.    PSA Group moved up 3 7/8 to 36 1/4. USAir agreed to acquire PSA Group's unit, Pacific Southwest Airlines, for $17 a share. Pacific Southwest Airlines, traded in the OTC market, rose 4 3/4 to 16. </TEXT></DOC>
