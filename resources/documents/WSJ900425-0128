Should Mr. Sokol need expert testimony corroborating hisconclusion that communism and fascism are mirror-imagetyrannies, here are some testimonials from experts on thesubject:</LP><TEXT>   Susan Sontag (American liberal-intellectual author andliterary critic): &quot;Not only is fascism (and overt militaryrule) the probable destiny of all Communist societies --especially when their populations are moved to revolt -- butCommunism is itself a variant, the most successful variant,of fascism.&quot;   Adolf Hitler: &quot;The petit bourgeois Social Democrat andtrade union boss will never make a National Socialist, butthe Communist always will. . . . There is more that unites usthan divides us from Bolshevism . . . above all the genuinerevolutionary spirit.&quot;   Andrei Sakharov (Russian dissident and Nobel Peace Prizewinner, to Soviet officials at the 1978 trial of AnatolyShcharansky): &quot;You are not humans. You are fascists. Hear me,a member of the Academy of Sciences. You are fascists.&quot;   Seweryn Bailer (Columbia University professor of RussianStudies and emigre from Poland): &quot;I came to realize that thesystem there {in the U.S.S.R.} involved all of the things Ihad fought against in Nazism. And I made my decision on thisto leave that system at the first opportunity.&quot;   Bernard-Henri Levy (French intellectual of the &quot;NewPhilosophers&quot; Movement): &quot;I am the bastard child of an unholyunion between fascism and Stalinism. . . . The onlyrevolution I know, the one which may grant notoriety to thiscentury, is the Nazi plague and Red fascism.&quot;   Prof. A. James Gregor (author of &quot;The Fascist Persuasionin Radical Politics,&quot; Princeton University Press, 1974): &quot;. .. Fascist and Communist regimes are subspecies of one and thesame species. . . . In substance, whatever distinctions thereare between `fascist' and `communist' movements in terms ofideological commitments -- they are singularly superficial.&quot;   Although your Asides did not address the problem of&quot;former&quot; Communist parties now calling themselves &quot;DemocraticSocialist&quot; or &quot;Social Democratic,&quot; there is an urgent need ingeopolitics for a label distinguishing such parties fromthose of Western &quot;social democrats&quot; -- who are, in truth,free-enterprise welfare-state democrats, rather thanstate-ownership socialists of Marxist tendency.   The new label is &quot;communoid,&quot; which simply indicates thatthe political party in question most assuredly was Communist(i.e. left-wing fascist) and, in its socialist heart ofhearts, may still be.
