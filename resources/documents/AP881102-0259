Democrat Michael Dukakis hoped to galvanize elderly voters onceagain with a broad-brush charge that Republican George Bush would``raid the Social Security trust fund'' if elected.   Bush sought to blunt the charge not only by vowing to keep hishands off Social Security, but by accusing Dukakis of dipping into aMassachusetts pension fund for $27 million to help balance his statebudget this year.   Some lobbyists for the elderly are worried that regardless ofsworn statements and good intentions, Social Security will be atempting target next year and into the 1990s for politicians tryingto balance the federal budget.   Robert Strauss, co-chairman of the National Economic Commissionwhich is supposed to recommend ways next spring to balance thebudget, touched off a firestorm in September by saying the only wayto cure the deficit is ``to go to Social Security, Medicare andentitlements generally and ... defense.''   Both the Dukakis and Bush campaigns disavowed the statement byStrauss, a former Democratic Party chairman.   Thirty-eight million retirees, disabled workers and theirfamilies count on that check in the mail on the third day of eachmonth from Social Security. They will get a 4 percent increase thisJanuary.   The $210 billion retirement and disability program, on the vergeof bankruptcy five short years ago, now is piling up huge surpluses.Its trust funds which grew to $69 billion last year, will add $40billion more in 1988 and are expected to swell to $646 billion bythe end of 1995.   Dukakis has claimed Bush will be forced to ``raid'' those trustfunds if he is serious about cutting the capital gains tax, spendingmore on the Pentagon and balancing the budget.   Bush has said repeatedly he will not touch Social Security.   ``If elected your president, I pledge that no one will take yourSocial Security away from you,'' Bush says in a political flyeraimed at the elderly.   Although Social Security's trust funds technically are listedapart from the rest of the federal budget, they are lumped togetherwhen the deficit is tallied.   Federal law prohibits spending Social Security's reserves onother programs, but every dollar added to the trust funds reducesthe overall deficit.   And since the trust funds must be invested in interest-bearingU.S. securities, they reduce the amount the government must borrowin private markets. The government uses the funds generated byselling bonds to Social Security to cover the operating deficit inother programs.   Social Security didn't save Jimmy Carter in 1980 or WalterMondale in 1984, but Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., said it was the issuethat cost Republicans control of the Senate in 1986.   Bush says he deserves credit with President Reagan for the 1983legislation that restored Social Security's fiscal health.   But Dukakis and others say Bush shares the blame for the deepcuts Reagan sought in Social Security after taking office in 1981.   As president of the Senate, Bush cast a tie-breaking vote on May9, 1985, for a budget freeze that would have blocked SocialSecurity's 1986 cost-of-living adjustment.   That freeze never materialized. Reagan, after initiallysupporting it, abandoned the package and it died. Afterwards, headopted the hands-off policy toward Social Security Bush promises toemulate.   Bush points out that Dukakis voted that same year at a NationalGovernors Association meeting in favor of a federal budget freeze.Dukakis did that, but only after waging a losing effort to exemptSocial Security.   Dukakis did divert a $27 million surplus from a state pensionfund this year, but he says it was only after fully paying thisyear's obligation, and he takes credit for a 1987 reform law thatmarks the first time the state has ever set money aside for futurepension obligations.   Bush's two top economic advisers, Martin Feldstein and MichaelBoskin, have been prominent academic critics of Social Security.   Feldstein has argued that Social Security depresses privatesavings. He also has proposed restricting cost-of-living increasesto the Consumer Price Index minus 2 percentage points.   Boskin, in a 1986 book, ``Too Many Promises: The Uncertain Futureof Social Security,'' proposed to revamp Social Security to separateits insurance and welfare aspects.   But some Democratic economists, looking for ways to reduce thedeficit, are talking quietly of making more retirees pay income taxon Social Security benefits. Only one retiree in 10 now is taxed onSocial Security.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance</NOTE></DOC>
