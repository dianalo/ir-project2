The government's show of force was the first of its kind nearTiananmen since a sit-in for a freer society with less corruptionbegan May 13.   The troopers from the People's Liberation Army marched in frontof the Beijing Hotel near Tiananmen about 6:30 a.m. and turned downa side street.   It was not clear how many of the thousands of students camped inthe square saw the procession.   ``I think they were just sent to try and scare us,'' said WangDi, a sophomore at Beijing Journalism Institute, who saw the troopspass by. ``But I didn't think anyone was scared. They didn't comethat close and not many students knew they were there.''   The government Wednesday held its first rally in response to sixweeks of pro-democracy protests. But a torched effigy of China'smost famous dissident and slogans supporting Premier Li Peng'shard-line policies failed to rouse the 4,000 people who attendedthe rally 20 miles outside Beijing.   Many participants said officials told them to attend.   Thousands of noisy marchers, meanwhile, trooped from Tiananmento police and Communist Party headquarters Wednesday night todemand the resignation of Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping, whohave led the crackdown on the popular uprising for democracy.   Conservatives are trying to discredit the student movement andconsolidate their position in a political power struggle withmoderates.   The marchers, primarily students, beat drums, pots and pans, andchanted ``Down with kidnapping!'' to protest the arrest this weekof three leaders of an independent labor union.   Zhao Pinglu, head of the trade union that was formed in sympathywith the pro-democracy movement, said the men were releasedWednesday after police questioned them for a day.   The government rally at a stadium in Daxing county was staged bysupporters of conservative leaders who reportedly have strippedmoderate Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang of his post.   ``We will oppose whoever opposes Li Peng,'' read one banner.Others supported martial law for central Beijing, decreed by Li onMay 20 after more than 1 million people took to the streets todemand more democracy and an end to corruption among officials.   The government rally, attended by peasants, workers and highschool students, lacked the enthusiasm of the pro-democracydemonstrations that have been mounted in major cities.   The burning of effigies of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, anoutspoken dissident who has campaigned for democracy, and anunidentified ``schemer,'' an apparent reference to Zhao, failed tostir the listless crowd.   Few people joined rally leaders in shouting ``long live theCommunist Party'' and other slogans. Some giggled and others wavedtiny flags instead.   ``I think this is a sham,'' said a 26-year-old worker shortlyafter the rally ended. ``As a citizen, I feel very indignant.''   ``That's right,'' said onlookers.   ``To tell you the truth, we were forced to come,'' said an18-year-old high school student.   Zhou Hong, a county official who organized the rally, said thedemonstration was to ``oppose turmoil'' created by a ``small groupof people'' for political goals.   Beijing officials informed some foreign journalists Tuesday ofthe Daxing march and two others in suburban Beijing. Nationwide TVbroadcast a brief segment of one of the marches during the eveningnews.   Large banners bearing slogans opposing ``bourgeoisliberalization'' and capitalism over socialism appeared on Beijinghotels on Wednesday.   Fang and a handful of other intellectuals were purged from theparty in the anti-bourgeois liberalization campaign of 1987, whichbegan after the last round of student-led protests for democracy.   But diplomatic and Chinese sources say a meeting of the partyCentral Committee to ratify the purge of Zhao has been postponedbecause the leadership remains divided.   Sources say at least 200,000 military troops called to Beijingto enforce martial law also are pawns in the power struggle goingon at the top levels.   Tens of thousands of citizens mobilized to block troops fromentering Beijing after Li declared martial law.   The march through central Beijing Wednesday night was muchsmaller than other pro-democracy demonstrations of the past fewweeks, highlighting the difficulties faced by the students to keeptheir movement alive despite continued government pressure.   The government maintained a media blitz condemning theoccupation of Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, where about10,000 students live in squatter camps to press their demands.</TEXT></DOC>
