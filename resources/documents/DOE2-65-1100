<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-65-1100 </DOCNO><TEXT>Pulverized coal combustion equipment has been traditionally designed withvery qualitative information about the coal used. However, changing coalsupplies and the design of new burner systems have led to the need formore quantitative information. The most important processes in coal combustionare coal pyrolysis and the combustion of the resultant gases and solids.The rate of each of these processes must be known as well as the yieldof pyrolysis products. Additionally, information about the effect ofenvironmental factors on these rates and yields must be known. One blendand eight coals with ranks from Anthracite to Lignite were characterizedusing an isothermal plug-flow reactor (IPFR). The experiments were performedunder simulated pulverized coal flame conditions so that the simple phenomenologicalmodels could be used to fit the data. The data from this study shouldbe useful for a number of purposes, including the qualitative understandingof coal behavior in pulverized coal burners and the quantitative predictionof pulverized coal flames with detailed mathematical models. The IPFRanalysis was shown to be an effective way of generating quantitativeinformation about the characteristics of coal during pulverized coalcombustion. The technique of simulating the environment encountered andusing simple models was successful. Additionally, a significant amountof specific information about the coals studied was generated. Recommendationsare given to improve the technique with the goal of creating a more simple,quick technique for accurate, quantitative data on coal combustion. 34figs., 42 refs., 23 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
