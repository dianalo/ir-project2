The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments fromthe manufacturer of the rifle, Olin Corp., that a federal judge inNew Hampshire erred when he held the company liable for theshooting.   Damages were not an issue in the appeal, but the victims, HenryFortier and Raymond Croteau, were awarded a total of $560,000 aspart of the Sept. 16, 1986, decision by U.S. District Judge MartinF. Loughlin.   Fortier and Croteau suffered foot wounds when a third teen-ager,Paul Croteau, stumbled and fell during the hunting trip nearBerlin, N.H. The rifle discharged when it hit the ground, and thebullet passed through Raymond Croteau's left foot then piercedFortier's right foot.   ``It could reasonably be concluded from the evidence that thedefective design made the rifle unreasonably dangerous for thepurpose sold _ to be used as a hunting weapon,'' the appeals courtsaid in a decision published Thursday.   ``There was evidence that defendant, despite its denial, had aconsumer product safety committee which was aware that there couldbe an accidental discharge caused by a hunter falling whilecarrying a rifle in a position similar to that of Paul Croteau onthe day of the accident,'' the court said.   Howard B. Myers, the New Hampshire attorney who represented theConnecticut-based company, did not immediately return telephonecalls from The Associated Press on Monday. An Olin spokesman saidhe did not know if the company would appeal.   At the New Hampshire trial, three firearms experts who testifiedfor the victims blamed the accident on the design of the WinchesterModel 94 rifle, a commemorative replica of the original 1866Winchester. One of them testified that because of its weight, thefiring pin was thrust forward when the rifle hit the ground andcaused the bullet to discharge even though the gun was half cocked,which acts as a safety on the rifle.   Two of the experts testified that they had tested the rifle andsaid it would fire, even when in the half-cocked position, ifrapped with a hand or a rubber mallet.   The victims also introduced evidence that Olin conducted testson the rifle in 1974 and 1976 to determine if it would fire whendropped to the ground. The tests indicated that the gun fired asmall percentage of the time.   Also introduced as evidence by the victims was a 1976 letter inwhich an Olin weapons engineer said it would cost between $1.75 and$2.50 a rifle to add an additional safety.   In 1982, U.S. Repeating Arms of New Haven, Conn., which hadobtained licensing rights to the Winchester name from Olin,introduced a modified version of the rifle with a lighter weightfiring pin. U.S. Repeating Arms since has been purchased by anothercompany.</TEXT></DOC>
