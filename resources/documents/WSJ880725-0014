Mossberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   Following a week in which major central banks put a halt to the dollar's recent surge, currency traders have concluded that governments are willing to tolerate much wider trading bands than previously thought.    In Washington, U.S. officials say they were pleased with the ability of the Federal Reserve and other major central banks last week to keep the dollar's rally within secret limits set by the Group of Seven, or G-7, nations last Dec. 22. They say they expect further brushes with those preferred exchange rates, possibly at the low end, in the next couple of months.    The officials were customarily imprecise in discussing the dollar, but they left no doubt that last week's concerted selling of dollars by central banks -- in contrast with more token, less coordinated intervention in previous weeks -- was designed to call a halt to the greenback's rise as it approached the upper end of their agreed range.    The officials noted that the G-7 from December had stated clearly and repeatedly that there were both lower and upper ends to the dollar's secret ranges. What's more, they said these haven't changed, despite some erroneous accounts coming out of the Toronto economic summit. But last week marked the first time the governments had stepped in to enforce the upper end, and many traders were surprised that the ceiling appears as high as it does.    From early June through its intraday peak July 18, the dollar climbed more than 10% to an 11-month high of 1.89 West German marks and more than 9% to 136.05 yen. But U.S. officials indicated they believed the dollar's early-summer rise wasn't strong or durable enough to affect the steady reduction of the U.S. trade deficit, or to offer much help in fighting inflation through lower import prices.    Following several days of intervention, plus earlier interest rate increases abroad, the dollar late Friday stood at 1.8275 marks, down from 1.8375 marks, in New York. The U.S. currency also fell to 130.86 yen from 131.50 yen a day earlier, while the British pound climbed to $1.7425 from $1.7285 Thursday.    In mid-morning trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 130.65 yen.    &quot;We got an answer to the big question that had been dominating currency markets since the economic summit in Toronto in mid-June: The central banks of the G-7 will react to dollar appreciation significantly above about 1.85 marks and 135 yen,&quot; John Lipsky, a director at Salomon Brothers Inc., said Friday. &quot;Just as in January when the market learned there are lower limits for the dollar that would elicit significant policy responses from the G-7, now we also see there are upper limits.&quot;    The lesson of the dollar's recent surge and retreat, says Mr. Lipsky, is &quot;that it is apparent that the magnitude of currency fluctuation that is acceptable to policy makers is wider than the narrow trading bands that prevailed through most of the first half of the year.&quot; This, he predicts, will lead to more volatility than occurred before the June summit.    Dealers noted that before the summit, the dollar mostly traded between about 1.65 and 1.70 marks and 125 and 130 yen. Central banks intervened in January and April to keep the dollar from plunging below the 1.60-mark and 120-yen levels. Coupled with last week's steps to cap the currency's ascent, traders and economists now believe the banks' so-called band of tolerance is a very wide 1.60-1.90 marks and 120-140 yen.    U.S. officials, however, warned that it may be impossible to extrapolate specific ranges from central bank intervention activity because the banks intervene for a variety of reasons.    &quot;Having seen there was a lower range at which central banks would act, markets were surprised to find the dollar go as high as it did without concerted action, most important without action by the U.S. and Japan,&quot; said Mr. Lipsky. &quot;Now they are likely to trade in a wider range without expecting any action.&quot;    A major reason for that, he said, was because G-7 monetary officials shifted their emphasis from trying to control exchange-rate movements as the principal instrument of monetary policy to concentrating on more traditional concerns about domestic inflation. For these reasons, market participants expect Germany, Japan and Britain to continue to tighten monetary policy -- despite last week's dollar decline.    During its five-week runup, the dollar's main support was traders' growing belief that the G-7 countries -- Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada in addition to the U.S. -- would tolerate a stronger dollar. There also was a currency market perception that there were divisions over exchange-rate policy between the West Germans and their U.S. and Japanese counterparts. In addition, they took the $10.93 billion May U.S. trade deficitwhich was released July 15 -- as a sign that the overall trade picture was improving.    But with the intervention and interest rate increases by countries including West Germany, Britain and Switzerland, &quot;Sentiment has definitely changed,&quot; said Stephen Dakin, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. &quot;A lot of people are calling for a lower dollar&quot; now after being bullish since June, he said.    Lisa Bortz, a corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said that &quot;people seem to be looking to high-yield currencies,&quot; particularly the pound and Canadian and Australian dollars.    Richard Witten, a vice president of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., predicted that the dollar will trade in a range of 1.81 to 1.8450 marks and 128.50 to 132.50 yen for the next couple of weeks, barring no major surprises on the economic or political fronts. And although he believes the dollar has &quot;more bias to go lower than higher from current rates,&quot; he says that continued pressure for higher U.S. interest rates could push the currency back up again.    Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist with James Capel andamp; Co. in London, said the dollar could even test its recent highs if the preliminary estimates for U.S. growth in the second quarter, to be released Wednesday, show the economy expanding at a 4% annual clip. &quot;It could cause Fed tightening and higher U.S. interest rates&quot; to battle potential inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, Mr. Dennis said.    The strengthening dollar could prompt aggressive selling of the currency by central banks, even though the dollar might still be within their agreed trading ranges.    U.S. officials indicated that, until last week, the greenback had remained within its prescribed ranges agreed by the G-7 nations for the whole period of its rise, thus accounting for the calm attitude toward the rise by the U.S. and Japanese governments during the early days of the dollar's run-up.    The officials said the West German Bundesbank and some other European central banks intervened earlier against the dollar, with the prior knowledge of the U.S. and Japan, but for domestic policy reasons and not to support the G-7 ranges, until last week. It's understood that, under the G-7 pact, individual countries can intervene for domestic reasons as long as the activity doesn't push the dollar out of the ranges.    Even last week, it wasn't certain whether the dollar breached the top end of its range, or merely was threatening to do so, when the governments moved in to knock it down. The officials made it clear that the timing of their interventions isn't always mechanically tied to the dollar's level, but is affected by questions of strategy, timing and their reading of market sentiment.
