Keating Jr., the former chairmanof American Continental Corp. who is accused of fraud, actedwith the approval of government regulators, his lawyerargued.   In his opening statement, Mr. Keating's lawyer, Stephen C.Neal, told the jury that American Continental's subordinateddebentures were sold with full disclosure of their risks.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Keating has been charged with 20 counts of securitiesfraud in connection with the sale of the debentures throughbranches of American Continental's former thrift unit,Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association. Prosecutors must provethat Mr. Keating had full knowledge of the tactics used inthe bond sales, and intended his employees to misleadpurchasers about the bonds.   Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman told the jurythat &quot;Charles Keating controlled the affairs, even the mostminute affairs, of American Continental,&quot; and must be heldcriminally liable for any wrongdoing. Mr. Hodgman presented achronology of the bond sales program, referring to a largechart that tracked American Continental's troubled financialhistory. He portrayed the sales as a Ponzi-type scheme tokeep the parent company flush with cash.   After Mr. Hodgman finished his opening statement, Mr. Nealslapped dozens of Post-It brand notes on the prosecution'schart, claiming that they represented occasions when companyexecutives consulted with regulators. &quot;If at any time theythought this {bond} program was unfair, unjust orinequitable, they could have just shut it down . . . but theynever did,&quot; Mr. Neal said.   In April 1989, a few months after the bond sales werediscontinued, American Continental filed for protection underChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Lincoln was seized byfederal regulators.</TEXT></DOC>
