Even though births have been creeping back up toward the level of 1960s, annual population growth remains well below the record 3.1 million &quot;baby-boom&quot; figure of 1967. With 242.1 million people, the country is 6.9% more populous than in 1980. The number that interests us most, however, is the estimate of a net migration into the U.S. of 554,000 people in 1986. Considering all the fuss made over immigration these past few years, it doesn't sound like such a huge number. </TEXT></DOC>
