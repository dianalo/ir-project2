And then I had to tell him there are at leasta dozen programs that do the same thing on the BBS I access.andP;  People candownload these programs for free.&quot;andM;Moody shook his head.andP;  &quot;They just think they're going to write a program,give it to an American and wait for the dollars to start rolling in.&quot;andO;Subbotin, who has spent 20 years in the Soviet computer field as a systemsanalyst and programmer, took Moody's advice to heart.andP;  &quot;His criticism had avery good foundation,&quot; Subbotin reasoned later.andP;  &quot;Since we do not know whatis a market here, we cannot know what is a market in the U.S.A.andP;  Such contactcannot be considered to be negative.andP;  After all, he left his card.andP;  I'llwrite him a paper.andP;  Why not?&quot;andM;IF UTTER MISUNDERSTANDING of foreign colleagues were an Olympic event, it'shard to say who would win--PC professionals from the United States or theirSoviet counterparts.andP;  Seldom have so many people tried so sincerely to figureout what the other side wanted and come away so baffled.andM;The lure of Russia is evident: A country covering one-sixth of the earth'sdry surface, with 284 million citizens, has suddenly awakened and realizedthat it needs to go shopping.andP;  Just a few years ago, the Soviet Union seemedinconsequential and unrelated to the fast-paced world of PCs.andP;  Now computercorporations, consultants and journalists are scrambling across the globe tobe a part of it.andM;But the results of all this activity have been disappointing.andP;  Americanbusinesses typically enter the Soviet Union by forming joint ventures infifty-fifty partnerships with Russian ministries or private cooperatives.andO;More than 1,000 joint ventures have been formed since they were legalized in1987, but fewer than 50 can rightfully be called successful.andO;Computer-related ventures make up only a handful of these.andM;This dismal record can be blamed only partly on the concrete barriers thatremain between East and West: trade restrictions, currency inconvertibility,legal differences, language.andP;  More often it seems to be the result ofpeople's failure to connect at a fundamental level.andP;  For when you get pastthe broad generalizations about Americans and Russians, neither side has aclue about what the other wants.andM;So what do the United States' leading PC people want from the Soviet Union?andO;And what do the top Soviet PC pros expect from the United States? Last June'sfirst International Computer Forum in Moscow--an event designed to bring bothsides together--seemed like a good place to find out.andM;THE INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER FoRum was sponsored by the International ComputerClub (ICC), a Soviet organization whose exact nature was a bit puzzling tothe Americans who attended, even though it was spelled out in English inseveral brochures.andP;  The ICC seems as much a trade association as thegrass-roots user group that the name implies.andP;  Its founding members includesome of the Soviet Union's top government agencies: the Academy of Sciences,the State Bank of the U.S.S.R.andP;  and GOSPLAN, the central economic-planningministry.andP;  Its goals are loosely assembled around the idea of bringing betterPC technology to the Soviet Union by helping Western firms deliver it.andO;Soviet member organizations (which pay to join) become more efficient throughautomation, while Western computer and software firms (which also pay, butsometimes with equipment) get sales prospects.andP;  Theoretically, it could workboth ways: The Americans might discover brilliant Soviet-produced softwarethat could be marketed in the United States.andP;  Or they might find a way to tapthe Soviet Union's supply of &quot;extremely talented, extremely cheap&quot;programmers (so goes the American stereotype).andM;Despite its official cachet, the ICC is &quot;non-governmental,&quot; responsible forits own activities and funding.andP;  A non-governmental group of mostlygovernment agencies, looking to spur international trade by calling itself aclub? No wonder American visitors were confused.andM;The ICC's first International Computer Forum, on the other hand, took a morefamiliar form: an old-fashioned computer show with an exhibit hall and threedays of expert-paneled sessions.andP;  Some heavy hitters had been recruited toinaugurate the event.andP;  The speaker lineup included chief executives fromthree of America's Top 10 software companies: Borland's Philippe Kahn,WordPerfect's Alan Ashton and Adobe's John Warnock.andP;  Jerry Schneider, founderof the Association of PC User Groups, a national coalition of grass-rootsuser organizations, ran a session, and Ken Wasch, executive director of theSoftware Publishers Association, was on hand as an observer.andP;  Industrypundits joined in, too: Stewart Alsop stopped by, and Esther Dyson, whohelped get all the influential Westerners to attend, also spoke.andM;&quot;We have not only these companies but also their leaders,&quot; beamed LevonAmdilyan, the hard-working ICC director who pulled together the forum.andP;  Suchimportant people would make a great impression on the forum's Sovietattendees.andP;  For them to see Philippe Kahn is like for an American to seeGorbachev,&quot; Amdilyan added.andM;The Soviets had no PC-market honchos to put up as presenters, but theyrepresented themselves well enough.andP;  One speaker was Abel Aganbegyan,economic advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev and often called the father ofperestroika.andP;  &quot;The economy is falling apart before our eyes,&quot; he told ayawning trade-show crowd.andM;Even before the forum, the different motivations of Americans who wouldattend started to become clear.andP;  Jerry Schneider, for instance, told me hewas traveling to the forum &quot;to participate in the world situation, to helpmake for a more peaceable planet.&quot; Schneider, a popular industry figure whosemustache and shaggy hair make him resemble rock singer David Crosby, had beeninvolved in the civil rights and anti-war movements in the 1960s.andP;  He marchedin the South, taught at Freedom Schools in Selma, Alabama, and later helpedto organize the Vietnam Veterans Committee Against the War.andP;  Today, he said,PCs in Russia could keep up the fight by promoting the free expression andinformation access that are prime ingredients of personal freedom.andM;&quot;This lets me go through the sixties again,&quot; he said.andM;At the computer forum, Schneider's role would be to moderate a paneldescribing PC user groups in the United States.andP;  He would call the session&quot;Bringing Computing Power to the People.&quot; It would include a live data hookupthat let Muscovites join an online conversation with user groups across theglobe.andM;&quot;The goal back then was to bring peace to the world by stopping an insanewar, to make the world a more peaceful place by changing it one piece at atime,&quot; Schneider explained.andP;  His motivations in the Soviet Union would not bemuch different.andP;  &quot;But this,&quot; he said, &quot;is a lot more possible.&quot;andM;&quot;THE FIRST TIME YOU GO TO RUSSIA, you think you can do anything in theworld,&quot; said Igor Lelchitsky, who also attended the forum.andP;  &quot;The second time,you start having your doubts.andP;  The third time, you think,  These Russiansdon't know what the hell they're doing.' The fourth time, you think you don'tknow what the hell you're doing.&quot;andM;Lelchitsky had stuck it out longer than most.andP;  An emigre who left Russia in1978, now a self-employed PC consultant in suburban Los Angeles, he hadreturned eight times in 12 months since the Nantucket Corporation, publisherof the Clipper database compiler, asked him last fall to help crack theSoviet market.andM;A programmer with no formal marketing background (he had been president ofthe San Fernando Valley Clipper Users Group), Lelchitsky quickly provedhimself the man to call if you wanted to move software in the Soviet Union.andO;Within months, forgoing the idea of a joint venture for Nantucket, hearranged for the company to become the first foreign software firm to open aprivate office in Moscow.andP;  Amazingly, in a climate where authorities squeezeAmerican businesses mercilessly for dollars when they want to establish apresence in the Soviet Union, Lelchitsky got Nantucket half a floor in aMoscow office building nearly free of charge.andP;  In some impossibly complicatedway, Nantucket U.S.S.R.andP;  is a subsidiary of the non-profit enterprise thatoccupies the building, a government-sanctioned &quot;Center for Scientific andTechnical Creativity of Youth.&quot;andM;&quot;We have a saying: Vsyo mozhno.andP;  Anything is possible,' &quot; Lelchitskyexplained.andP;  &quot;I'm working with joint ventures, I'm working with governmentcompanies, I'm working with co-ops.andP;  I'm working with everybody.andP;  I'm workingwith the system.andP;  You never know who is going to win this horse race, so youhave to work with everybody.andP;  And you work with everybody differently.andP;  Andif you get good relations, and if people know you are not going to let themdown, they will help you.&quot;andM;Most impressive of Lelchitsky's achievements is that he has somehow sold morethan 700 copies of Clipper in a nation where copying software is perfectlylegal.andP;  Nantucket estimates that there are 15,000 unlicensed copies ofClipper in the Soviet Union.andP;  Users include the KGB and the Army.andP;  It's hardfor Lelchitsky to see a PC in the Soviet Union without seeing a copy ofClipper for which Nantucket has received no compensation.andM;&quot;Let me put it this way--I usually close my eyes,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I didn't haveto advertise Clipper because everybody already knew about it.&quot;andM;This is a nagging problem for every software publisher and was a key topic ofdiscussion at the forum.andP;  Still, Nantucket has managed to sell software bydoing something innovative: giving Russians a chance to buy it with their ownmoney.andM;You see, besides software protection, a hurdle all Western businesses face isthe Soviet Union's bleak money situation.andP;  The nation's economy is so woefuland its government so unpredictable that no Western country will trade itscurrency for Soviet rubles.andP;  Therefore, most American companies hoping tomake a safe buck sell only for &quot;hard&quot; currency (that is, dollars).andP;  Or tryto.andP;  Some state organizations reportedly have stockpiles of hard currencyfrom exports of natural resources to the West, but they are stingy aboutspending it.andP;  And, until restrictions were recently relaxed, the only privatecitizens who held hard currency were those who accepted it illegally: taxidrivers, waiters, street merchants and prostitutes.andM;So Nantucket took the radical step of selling for rubles, the currency inwhich Soviet workers are paid.andP;  A copy of Clipper in Russia costs 5,995rubles.andP;  How much is 5,995 rubles? At the 6-to-1 &quot;tourist&quot; exchange rate,it's $1,000.andP;  But Lelchitsky based his price on a more real-life currencyexchange: the street.andP;  Acknowledging how weak the ruble truly is, Russianblack marketeers will trade more than 10 per dollar.andP;  So Lelchitsky looselymultiplied Clipper's U.S.andP;  retail price ($595) by 10 to arrive at 5,995rubles.andP;  This doesn't explain how, when a top Russian programmer might make4,000 rubles a year, anyone can afford 6,000 rubles for software that can becopied legally.andP;  But maybe this does: &quot;They are tired of stealing,&quot;Lelchitsky said.andP;  &quot;Right now, I let them buy.&quot;andM;What can be done with all these rubles? Foreign companies are prohibited fromtaking them out of the country (where they'd be no good anyway).andP;  Rublesaren't guaranteed to be much good in the country, either, given the shortagesof most useful products (Russian joke: &quot;You can't find anything in thestores, but at least the prices are low.&quot;) and the questionable quality ofsome Soviet-made goods (more than 2,000 Soviet-built TV sets burst intoflames every year, according to a top Soviet economist).andP;  You can spend yourrubles on local office expenses, payroll and advertising, or give them tocharity (all of which Nantucket does), or look for creative ways to exchangethem or wait until they become convertible into dollars.andP;  Meanwhile, sellingfor rubles gets you one thing no amount of dollars can buy: the market.andM;&quot;What you're basically doing is trying to educate the market and sell themsomething that they're not used to buying,&quot; Lelchitsky explained.andP;  &quot;Our goalis to take over the market.andP;  Right now, I'm just establishing a beachhead.andO;When you do that, you know the first troops are going to die.andP;  Those are yourexpenses.andP;  But you also know that the next wave of troops might be able totake the beach.andP;  And then the war is over.&quot;andM;OUR HOTEL, THE MEZHDUNARODNAYA, and the adjacent World Trade Center, wherethe forum was held, had been built in 1980 with the assistance of Americantycoon Armand Hammer.andP;  This was no coincidence.andP;  Hammer's story is relevantto today's PC dealings, since he was the first American to do business withthe Soviet Union, right after the Revolution.andM;Hammer had become wealthy in the United States during Prohibition, selling acompound that changed ginger ale into ginger beer.andP;  Venturing to Russia in1921 with the intention of offering medical care, he discovered a paradox--anation rich in resources such as coal, asbestos and furs but in the midst offamine.andP;  So he arranged to have a million dollars in grain shipped to Russiain a barter deal for goods.andM;His efforts won him an audience with Lenin, who understood that, despite itslofty goals, the embryonic Soviet Union needed Western technology and goodsto sustain itself.andP;  Lenin granted Hammer franchises to a slew of businessenterprises during the early and mid-1920s, the period of the experimentalNew Economic Policy in which free enterprise was encouraged.andP;  Hammer madeanother fortune and lived like a king in Russia.andP;  During the height of ahousing crisis in Moscow, he had a 24-room house.andP;  But for him, unabashedcapitalism went hand-in-hand with altruism.andP;  Each was gratifying; each madethe other possible.andM;In 1927, Stalin ended the New Economic Policy.andP;  Businesses were shut, theirholdings confiscated by the state.andP;  Hammer got out, but many didn't.andO;Millions of entrepreneurs, scientists, academics and other freethinkers wereimprisoned or killed, beginning a prohibition on information andindividuality that lasted 60 years.andM;History shows there is much to be done and much money to be made in remedyingthe ills of an unpopular prohibition.andP;  This fact escapes no American doingbusiness in the Soviet Union.andP;  Still, given the track record of economicreform there, it's no wonder today's Soviet businesspeople are morecautiously optimistic about the progress of perestroika than their U.S.andO;associates.andM;&quot;They're all afraid of tomorrow,&quot; Lelchitsky said.andP;  I'D NEVER MET IGORLELCHITSKY in person before the forum, but I recognized him immediatelyduring registration.andP;  He wore a close-cropped Russian beard, onyx ring, goldbracelet and eyeglasses with those fashionable black strings hanging over hisshoulders.andP;  More telling was his manner: hustling in and out of theexhibition hall obviously making sure the Nantucket booth was just right.andO;Soon after, I met Vanessa Wade, Nantucket's managing director for Central andEastern European sales.andP;  That evening, at a table in the hotel lobby bar,Lelchitsky and Wade related their adventures in Soviet marketing--tales thatin a normal business setting would be called horror stories but in thecontext of Soviet history can only be called major aggravations.andP;  Whilenothing suggests a Stalinist reign of terror is around the corner, the Sovietcommercial environment does change about as often as the guards beforeLenin's mausoleum.andP;  This does not so much frighten U.S.andP;  PC people as drivethem up a wall.andM;&quot;Every day it's a new situation, a new batch of laws,&quot; Wade said.andP;  &quot;We'veasked our lawyers to come in here and figure out what's going on, and theysimply can't do it.andP;  Every day they come in and ask, 'What did we do lastweek that will be illegal this week?&quot;'andM;&quot;There are laws,&quot; Lelchitsky said, &quot;but then they do amendments that cancelout the laws.andP;  For example, to promote a market economy they try to getforeign companies to come here.andP;  But then comes a new rule that says aforeign company can't have more than 100,000 rubles in a bank account.&quot;andM;So,&quot; said Wade, explaining the implications, &quot;they're encouraging foreigncompanies to sell only for hard currency,&quot; which makes it difficult forSoviets to buy.andP;  &quot;It's a perfect example of a law that was totally notthought through.andP;  Nobody understood why they did it.andP;  It's like they're justpassing laws because they're supposed to pass laws.andP;  Like they have a quota.&quot;andM;So how do companies that sell in rubles, like Nantucket, get around this one?andM;&quot;Well, it's not really a law,&quot; Lelchitsky tried to explain.andP;  &quot;It's more of asuggestion.&quot;andM;&quot;Another example,&quot; Wade continued Nantucket's current office, she said,wasn't the first one it had in Moscow.andP;  Originally, the office was closer tothe center of town, in a building run by an influential governmentorganization.andM;&quot;We fixed it up really nice.andP;  Cleaned it, painted it.andP;  Then, one day, one ofthe top managers from this organization happened to be walking past theoffice, and he really liked it.andP;  The next day, we're out.andP;  No explanationwhatsoever.&quot;andM;Sometimes the routine problems Nantucket encounters have less to do with theno-win system than with the effect it has had on its people.andM;&quot;They have this prebuilt mentality,&quot; said Lelchitsky.andP;  &quot;People weren't paidto get things done.andP;  Just to be busy: office trips, that sort of thing.andP;  Why?andO;Because there's no unemployment here.andP;  It was a problem to fire somebody, aproblem to hire somebody, a problem to change jobs.andM;&quot;Sometimes you forget that they are Russians, and you presume something isdone, and you don't tell them any more.andP;  In America, if something is notdone, people who are working for you are going to tell you.andP;  In Russia, theydon't...andP;  The worst thing is to lose your temper, because they've been pushedaround so many times in their lives they don't like it, and you're gettingyour relations in trouble.andP;  So you have to be patient, and go back andexplain, again and again and again...&quot;andM;THE MOST POPULAR EXHIBITORS on the floor of the International Computer Forumwere Borland and Nantucket.andP;  IBM had the largest booth, but it was chainedoff from floor traffic; you had to talk your way in.andP;  And then there was ZeosInternational, a PC clone maker from St. Paul.andM;Zeos had become a success story in the United States by selling high-qualityPCs by mail order for hard-to-beat prices.andP;  Inc. magazine listed Zeos amongthe fastest-growing small private companies in the country for 1989, andcomputer magazines were praising its machines left and right.andP;  But itsprominence in the States paled alongside its celebrity in Russia.andM;The company's chairman, Greg Herrick, sensing his company was not ready toenter the crowded European market, has made the Soviet Union a focus of hismarketing efforts, appearing regularly at Moscow computer shows andadvertising heavily throughout the country.andP;  At one Moscow show, Zeos provedpopular when it gave away 4,000 promotional floppy diskettes.andM;&quot;They had to call the police.andP;  It was almost a riot.andP;  We had seven policementhere to administer the line,&quot; Herrick said.andP;  For this show, Zeos (along withBorland) was a sponsor and loaned 17 machines to exhibitors.andM;&quot;Our intention and objective at this juncture is to build  mind share' in themarket,&quot; Herrick explained.andP;  &quot;Clearly, it's a large market.andP;  There are 350million people or whatever in the Soviet Union, starved for technology.andP;  To acompany of our size, whether it's a $1 billion market or a $2 billion marketdoesn't make much difference.&quot;andM;Nobody really knows what shape the Soviet PC market will take.andP;  Estimates pegthe number of PCs in the Soviet Union today at 200,000 to 600,000,representing a hodgepodge of Western (including Holland's Tulip Computers,Austria's Future Technology and Italy's Olivetti), Far Eastern and Sovietmodels.andP;  Either estimate is short of the 1.1 million PCs the governmentcalled for by 1990 in its Twelfth Five-Year Plan, and even the mostoptimistic projections lag hopelessly behind the 30 million PCs some expertsbelieve it would take to bring the Soviet Union to a Western level ofautomation.andM;Some of the slow market development can be attributed to the stifling Sovietbureaucracy.andP;  A related problem is that most foreign hardware companies,which have higher production costs than software publishers, can't afford tosell for anything but hard currency.andP;  Then there have been the traderestrictions.andP;  For four decades, the Coordinating Committee for MultilateralExport Controls, or COCOM (an alliance of nations that roughly parallelsNATO, with the notable addition of Japan), has agreed to limit technologytrade to Communist nations.andP;  Largely due to military concerns, COCOM hasensured that PCs exported to Russia have remained at least one generation ofprocessors behind those in the West.andP;  This summer, COCOM approved shipment ofhigh-end, 386-based PCs to Eastern-bloc nations.andM;Partly for each of these reasons, Zeos hadn't made any large Soviet salesyet.andP;  But the hearts and minds of Russian computer people, at least, werewon.andM;&quot;I was riding down the elevator with some guy from California who said,  Idon't know what you guys have done, but you've got the Soviets convinced thatyou're the IBM of the Soviet Union,&quot;' Herrick said.andP;  Incidentally, he added,&quot;IBM might have problems because I don't think [the Soviets] are going to buyinto the Micro Channel.andP;  Fortunately, in the Soviet Union, they don't havethe huge installed base of IBM mainframes and minis.andP;  And they don't have thesales force that can go in and intimidate people into purchasing the rest oftheir product line.andP;  So they have to start out like the rest of us.&quot;andM;Russia: to boldly go where no IBM sales rep has gone before.andM;MOST OF THE FEW DOZEN Soviet exhibitors on the forum floor were from Moscow,but some came from cities throughout the far-flung Soviet republics.andP;  Manyhad very Soviet-sounding names, such as Scientific and ProductionAmalgamation of Computing and Informatics.andP;  To an American, this sounds muchsillier than paying a consultant to name your company something like&quot;Compaq.&quot;andM;It was difficult to understand how the assorted Soviet organizations fittogether, what each body's distinct purpose was.andP;  A few were joint ventures.andO;Seemingly absent were Soviet  cooperatives,&quot; government-sanctioned (butpublicly mistrusted as profiteers&quot;) private companies, which probablycouldn't handle the 20,000-ruble exhibitor fee.andP;  Most booths were spartan andoccupied by government ministries and institutes that displayed programs theyhad developed internally.andP;  This made it seem like a show where most vendorswere the MIS departments of corporations and government agencies, which saidas much as anything about the absence of a Soviet market system.andM;In many cases, the first obstacle was understanding what the softwareactually did.andP;  Ken Wasch, head of the Software Publishers Association,observed that Soviet developers were far more adept at extolling themathematical genius behind a program's creation than explaining what benefitsit might deliver to a user.andP;  One program, called &quot;Inventive Machine,&quot; wasdefined as a &quot;creative problem-solver,&quot; and its demonstrator dwelled proudlyon the Russian theory that underlay it.andP;  It took much badgering to learn thatit was a knowledge base of information about the world's great patents.andM;In other cases, there seemed to be no logical link between the exhibitor andthe type of programs it showed.andP;  Dozens of state organizations sold Russianspell-checkers and games, as if producing these was their governmentalfunction.andP;  IMRAD Scientific and Technical Center, a &quot;Center for Scientificand Technical Creativity of Youth&quot; from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku,showed a system for maritime rescue operations (a vital application, to besure, but not what you'd expect from an organization that sounds like theYMCA).andM;Just as intriguing was my experience behind IMRAD's booth.andP;  It was the firsttime I'd been served cognac at a computer expo.andP;  Alexander Sarukhanov, anative Azerbaijani who runs IMRAD's Moscow office, poured.andP;  In return, Iasked him a baited question: What do you think about all these Americanscoming over here to explain how little the Soviets know about the computerbusiness?andM;&quot;They are very patronizing,&quot; he replied thoughtfully, in a deep Britishaccent.andP;  &quot;Americans, they have a big superiority complex.andP;  And we have aninferiority complex  ...andP;  Unfortunately, the Americans' complex is justified...andP;  and so is ours.andM;&quot;I know Americans,&quot; added Sarukhanov, who also runs the Moscow office of aSoviet-American joint venture.andP;  &quot;And I know the problem.andP;  All you Americans,you have too much faith in common sense.andP;  That is not the way things workhere.&quot;andM;The show's first day wound down with a reception, where a mammoth buffettable the size of a hundred salad bars-covered with breads, caviar, smokedsalmon, bottles of mineral water and vodka--fed the thousands of forumattendees.andP;  In a back room, American and Soviet VIPs engaged in the Russiantradition of swapping toasts.andP;  Stewart Alsop, who had buzzed in from Cannes,via London, on his way to yet another European location, raised a glass.andM;&quot;As Russia embarks on this new journey, we wish you luck,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;I was the only one to make a reference to the political situation,&quot; Alsoptold me afterward.andP;  Did he really think PCs could make a difference?andM;&quot;PC people have always been revolutionaries,&quot; he replied.andP;  &quot;They're the guyswho wrested control from the mainframe guys.andP;  Yeah.andP;  Once you put PCs onthese people's desks, give them the power to control their world, it'llfundamentally shift the balance of power.andP;  These guys won't let go.andP;  Andthings will never be the same.&quot;andM;&quot;IT'S A VERY GREAT PLEASURE for all of us to be here in the Soviet Union,&quot;Jerry Schneider said as he opened his session, &quot;Bringing Computing Power tothe People.&quot; After apologizing for not speaking Russian, Schneider ranthrough a slide show that explained the scope and structure of user groups inthe United States.andP;  The most effective image was a shot of a skinny,flannel-shirted Steve Jobs at a 1979 West Coast Computer Fair.andP;  Schneider hadjust explained how Jobs and Steve Wozniak met at a user-group meeting andwent on to create the American PC industry.andP;  Yet the slide on the screendepicted Jobs meekly handing out fliers to anyone who walked by.andP;  It lookedencouragingly like the scene on the exhibition floor here.andM;&quot;We started with very simple beginnings, don't let anyone make you thinkotherwise,&quot; Schneider said.andM;Technicians from Borland then painstakingly brought to life the session'spromised online link with user groups around the world.andP;  This was no easytask, since there are only about 35 public long-distance lines between theSoviet Union and the United States, and the one reserved for the session wasacting up.andP;  Borland's Jim Moody finally made the connection from his PC andput Moscow in conference with PC users from Ann Arbor, Michigan, Los Angeles,Vancouver, Scotts Valley, California, and Portland, Oregon.andM;&quot;'Greetings from the United States of America,&quot;' Moody read one conferencer'smessage aloud.andP;  &quot;  This moment shall go down in history because it marks thebeginning of the global user group.andP;  A momentous occasion.'...The sysop says,I invite each of us to come forth together to invent the possibility ofglobal peace and well-being through communication and computer technology ...... And then line noise took him away somewhere.andM;&quot;I thought I went over there fairly sophisticated,&quot; Schneider would say whenhe returned to the States.andP;  &quot;But every situation was an eye-opener.andP;  Youdevelop this notion of a very technically sophisticated nation, but thetechnology has not gotten down to the life of the average Soviet citizen.&quot;andM;The biggest shock, he said, came when he discovered that the most commoncomputing device in Russia is not the PC, not the cash register, but thehand-held abacus.andM;&quot;We had commitments to donate some modems and stuff like that.andP;  That becomesa little difficult when one out of 16 people has a telephone.andP;  It took us twohours to make the connection for our online conference, and that was with alot of connections, people who know how to get things done.&quot;andM;&quot;But I'm more psyched up than before I went there,&quot; Schneider added.andP;  &quot;Byhook or by crook, we'll get them communicating electronically with the West.&quot;andM;I caught up with Esther Dyson over coffee in the lobby bar of theMezhdunarodnaya hotel.andP;  Dyson, who writes for this magazine, Forbes and herown newsletter, has become in a short period of time the closest thing theAmerican PC industry has to a Soviet ambassador.andP;  She writes frequently aboutSoviet computing, holds conferences dealing with East-West technologytransfer and often escorts Soviet programmers on their first visits to theUnited States.andM;What makes working in the Soviet Union different from helping spur PC use inanother foreign country, say, England?andM;&quot;Well, a lot of people have discovered England,&quot; Dyson answered.andP;  &quot;I mean, Ican't add a whole lot.andP;  The thing that drives a lot of people is making adifference.andP;  It's one of these things where, if I didn't exist now, Godwouldn't create me in the U.S.andP;  If I didn't exist now in the Soviet Union, itwould be kind of helpful if God did create me, or somebody to act as acatalyst...andP;  My role is just to be a little grease so that things can run alittle bit smoother, and maybe a little bit of fiber-optic cable so thatpeople can communicate.andP;  I don't actually do any of the heavy moving.andP;  I justtry to show people where things are.andP;  And then the role won't be necessaryand I'll get bored and I'll--I don't know--go discover notepad computers orsomething.&quot;andM;TECHNOLOGICALLY, THINGS HAVE COME a long way--and will go further.andP;  In thesixties, you needed a license to buy a typewriter in Russia.andP;  Until recently,a copy machine had to be kept in a separate room with a metal door and barson the windows, and users had to sign a journal every time they made a copy.andM;&quot;Then you get too many Xerox machines, and it's impossible to control themand put each in a separate room,&quot; explained Alexander Sarukhanov, mycognac-drinking buddy from IMRAD.andP;  We were now at the joint venture he helpedmanage, a modern office in a huge, gray building &quot;built by Stalin,&quot; heobserved (Stalin is now blamed for everything ugly in Russia).andP;  Three286-based Olivetti PCs and a copy machine sat on various desktops.andM;&quot;With computers, it's not just that you can do it quicker or better.andP;  You cando it.andP;  Tomorrow, take away all the computers and try to decentralize thiseconomy.andP;  No chance.andM;&quot;I believe this help works both ways,&quot; he continued, revealing somethingbeyond the cynicism he had expressed at the show booth.andP;  &quot;Because if you helpto develop the PC infrastructure in this country, that will bring anarms-force reduction in the Soviet Union, for sure.andP;  Of course it's not astraightforward process, but I believe it does exist.andP;  You get moreliberalized, more democratic, and you start thinking,  Why do we need allthese missiles and all these tanks? Perhaps you'd better produce tractors orcars.andP;  You can make a lot of cars out of one tank.' So next time when theyhave a choice during the election, they will never vote for a militarycandidate.&quot;andM;Still, Sarukhanov admitted, the economics of owning PCs in the Soviet Unionare not implicit.andM;&quot;I'm still surprised people here buy PCs,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Because if you buy a PCin the States, say it's $2,000 for a normal AT, right? And one man on this ATcan do the job of three people, for example.andP;  OK? So, you can have two peopleless.andP;  Two people for ...andP;  I don't know, what's the average salary?&quot;andM;I tell him $25,000 a year.andM;&quot;Which makes $2,000 a month, right? So, there's the cost efficiency.andP;  A goodexample.andP;  Here, you buy the same thing.andP;  You pay for a normal AT with a dotmatrix printer, at least 60,000 rubles.andP;  The average salary being 300 rublesa month.andP;  So if you manage to use one man less it will take you 200 months tojustify the cost of the PC.&quot;andM;So there must be something else going on in that equation, I suggested.andM;&quot;Yes, of course, otherwise no one would buy.andP;  It's very prestigious, thingslike that, there's a lot of factors.&quot; Factors that include the same kind ofinexplicable attraction to PCs that every aficionado in the United States hasfelt.andM;&quot;Sometimes when you have nothing better to do and you take a PC home, thereis no sleep,&quot; he admitted.andP;  &quot;It's like whitewashing your kitchen, you know.andO;I mean, it gives you the same kind of satisfaction.andP;  Look, it was dirty andrusty and now everything shines, and you can be proud.andP;  It's something youachieved with your hands.andP;  And now you feel you can achieve something withyour head.andP;  Personal, that's the main thing.andP;  Because you don't depend onanyone else.&quot;andM;ON THE LAST NIGHT we would be together, I sat at the lobby bar with IgorLelchitsky and Vanessa Wade.andP;  One round came, then another, and the talk thistime wasn't about conquering the market or struggling with laughable Sovietlaws.andP;  It was about the past.andP;  Wade, it turned out, had emigrated to theUnited States from Poland in 1978.andP;  For both her and Lelchitsky, I realizedfor the first time as the night wore on, there was more to this enterprisethan just a sales and marketing adventure.andM;&quot;It's really very personal for us,&quot; Wade said.andP;  &quot;You want to help thesepeople in any way you can.andP;  I feel like I owe something to them.andP;  I want tobe able to say to my grandchildren that I did something good.andP;  It's verypersonal.&quot;andM;&quot;That's it,&quot; Lelchitsky nodded, his face a little flushed.andP;  &quot;That's it.&quot; Andhe reached over to shake her hand.andP;  &quot;You only live so long ...andP;  and then youdie.andP;  You might as well be able to say you made a difference.&quot;andM;Lelchitsky never expected to return to Russia after he and his wife left in1978.andP;  There were hard feelings.andM;&quot;I was born in Russia,&quot; he explained, &quot;and I also was born a Jew, in acountry that was very anti-Semitic.andP;  It was a government policy.andP;  I felt likeI had a lot of potential which I never could realize.andP;  I became a projectleader at 23.andP;  And I couldn't move up.andP;  So one of the reasons for me to leavewas that my career was already done at 23.&quot;andM;When he applied for a visa, Lelchitsky lost his job immediately.andP;  Arriving inthe United States on May Day, 1979, he got a programming job with First Bankof Houston, then moved to Union Bank.andP;  Then Getty Oil, Columbia Pictures andDisney.andP;  In Los Angeles he became an independent programmer and consultant.andM;&quot;When I was leaving, my dad was dying of cancer,&quot; Lelchitsky said.andP;  &quot;Icouldn't stay because, see, I had a feeling that the door was going to getshut very soon.andP;  I was right.andP;  It got shut in two months.andP;  My friend appliedfor a visa, and he was refused for 10 years.andP;  He lost his job.andP;  He became anelectrician in a puppet show.andP;  He had been a petroleum engineer.andM;&quot;So one of the reasons I came to Russia was actually to say good-bye to mydad.andP;  And there's something else.andP;  When I left Russia, there were a lot ofbad feelings.andP;  Russia with all these terrorism acts, with nuclear arms.andP;  Iknew if somebody wants war, it's Russia.andP;  Because you knew Americans don'twant to have this war.andP;  I mean, who would like to have a war if you're livinglike this, right? So even living in America, Russia was creating problems forme still.andP;  So I help for another reason: I don't want to have this problem.andO;I have a daughter who's 10 years old.andP;  I don't want her to be scared.andP;  And Idon't want her to be embarrassed.andP;  She was embarrassed to speak Russianbecause there was such bad publicity.andP;  But right now she's not.andP;  Right nowshe's quite proud because Russia is such a big fad right now.andP;  And she cansee those papers from Russia with my picture, you know, and I'm important,right? She loves it.&quot;andM;Is there a sense of triumphant return?andM;&quot;Yeah, I feel good when people who never would let me through the door nowactually recognize me, are glad to see me.andP;  Yeah, I enjoy it.andP;  Hell,sometimes I feel like a king in Russia.andP;  But by the same token, I really wantto help Russia.andP;  I always feel that there should be something important youdo, so on the day you're dying you feel like you achieved something.andP;  Andright now what I achieved, I opened the first office of a software company inthe Soviet Union.andP;  So it's really something.&quot;andM;So the rubles keep piling up and Lelchitsky keeps leaving them on the table,letting them ride to see what more can be done.andM;&quot;Like a gambler,&quot; he smiled.andP;  &quot;If you're ready to go home, then you cash out.andO;I'm not ready to cash out yet.andP;  I'm still playing the game.&quot;andM;U.S.andP;  Software:andM;What's Red-Hot in RussiaandM;a Very Unofficial ListandM;This list represents the first attempt to rank the popularity of U.S.andP;  PCapplications packages in the Soviet Union.andP;  Measuring Soviet software usageby soles figures is futile, because copying software has been as legal in theSoviet Union as eating borscht.andP;  Everyone does it.andP;  Publishers that haven'tsold a disk in Russia have arrived to discover their packages asnear-standards among users.andM;These rough rankings ore based on interviews with U.S.andP;  and Soviet PCexperts, our own observations and estimates by U.S.andP;  vendors, most of whomgrin and bear the situation.andP;  Perhaps they heed the words of Simpsons creatorMatt Groening, who, after a wave of unauthorized Bart Simpson T-shirts hitthe streets, quipped:  Rampant copyright infringement is the sincerest formof flattery.&quot;andM;1.andP;  Norton Commander (Peter Norton Computing)andM;Commander's familiar screen marked the beginning and end of virtually everysoftware demonstration we saw in both Moscow and Leningrad.andP;  &quot;You'd think itwas bundled in with the machines,&quot; said one observer.andP;  An estimated 400,000PCs are in the Soviet Union.andP;  We figure about 150,000 run Commander.andM;2.andP;  Turbo Pascal  Borland international inc.)andM;Borland claims to have 85 percent of the Soviet Union's PC language market, afigure in keeping with our observations.andP;  Turbo Pascal leads the way.andP;  Amongthe programs written in Turbo Pascal is the infectious game Tetris, the firstSoviet software sold in the United States.andM;3, 4.andP;  Framework, DBASE (Ashton-Tate)andM;The Soviet Union boosts &quot;the world's largest concentration of Frameworkapplication programmers,&quot; says Bruce Marquart, manager of Ashton-Tate EasternEurope.andP;  The integrated Framework, thanks in part to its easily modifiablescreen and keyboard drivers, tops even Ashton-Tate's popular DBASE, which hasbecome the database standard here.andP;  Users reportedly include the CommunistParty of the Soviet Union.andP;  Both programs are especially popular outside thecapital.andP;  &quot;Once you get outside Moscow, it's pretty much all Framework andDBASE,&quot; Marquart says.andM;5, 6.andP;  Turbo C, Turbo Basic  Borland)andM;7, 8.andP;  QuickC, QuickBASIC (Microsoft Corp.)andM;By most estimates, Soviet PC programmers outnumber PC end users, whichexplains the popularity of language tools.andP;  Even Prolog remains a populardevelopment platform.andP;  The next sizzler: C++.andP;  In June, Borland CEO PhilippeKahn &quot;left a few demo copies&quot; when he introduced his spanking new C++compiler at Moscow State University.andP;  By July, he says, it was &quot;in useeverywhere.&quot;andM;9.andP;  Clipper (Nantucket Corp.)andM;When a Nantucket spokesman asked a Moscow trade-show audience how many ofthem use the Clipper database compiler, hands went up like a baseball-stadiumwave.andP;  Users reportedly include the KGB and the Army.andP;  Nantucketconservatively estimates that 15,000 copies are on Soviet PCs.andP;  But since itopened a Moscow office and began selling Clipper for rubles, Nantucket hassold more than 700 copies.andM;10.andP;  PC Storyboard Plus (IBM)andM;Dozens of booths at the International Computer Forum flashed dazzling andintricate presentations, courtesy of IBM's Storyboard presentation software.andO;Russian programmers have used the software's font editor to incorporateCyrillic text into their PC slide shows.andP;  !!!
