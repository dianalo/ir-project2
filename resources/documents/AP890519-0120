Nearly the entire high command of this Marxist government hasbeen killed, a Western diplomat said, in an attempted coup led bygenerals humiliated in a string of recent defeats against rebels innorthern Ethiopia.   ``If we move into a `night of the long knives,' it (the highcommand) will be gutted even more,'' the diplomat said, ``There'llbe a certain amount of retribution.''   Despite reports of continued scattered fighting, the governmentconfidently said it has thoroughly smashed the rebellion.   Briefing foreign ambassadors in the capital Friday, ForeignMinister Berhanu Bayih said the revolt ``was crushed at the centerhere in Addis Ababa'' within hours Tuesday evening.   Lingering resistance was stamped out Thursday when loyalsoldiers of the 2nd Army killed their ``commander and hiscollaborators'' in Asmara, Ethiopia's second-largest city andcapital of the northernmost province of Eritrea.   ``It was a very self-confident briefing by the minister,'' saida Western diplomat. ``I think Mengistu has got back in the saddle.   ``He has shown a degree of efficiency and ruthlessness thatmight have surprised some,'' the diplomat said on condition ofanonymity.   But the envoy noted the ``military situation in the north isgoing to be substantially eroded.''   Mengistu's troops have been fighting secessionist rebels inEritrea and another rebel group seeking autonomy for theneighboring province of Tigre.   But they have consistently lost ground to the rebels, despitemassive military aid from the Soviet Union, which counts Ethiopiaas its staunchest African ally.   ``The high command was virtually gutted,'' the diplomat said ofthe reported deaths of at least eight rebellious generals and thecountry's defense minister, who was killed by the mutineers. Sixdissident generals are said to have been killed in the Asmarafighting.   Mengistu, in a radio and TV broadcast to the nation Thursdaynight, promised his ``revolutionary forces will liquidate'' hisenemies.   Plotters had ``committed treason by attempting to join handswith secessionist and rebel movements in northern Ethiopia,'' thepresident said.   The tide turned for the mutineers Thursday when three loyalunits of the 2nd Army moved on Asmara from neighboring towns,recapturing the radio station and killing the army's commander,Maj. Gen. Denissie Bulto, according to Berhanu.   The counterrevolt came only hours after the rebel EritreanPeople's Liberation Front announced it was calling a two-weekcease-fire to boost the dissidents' chances of ousting Mengistu.   In a clandestine radio broadcast, the rebels said their leadershad met with 2nd Army commanders to discuss ``the best way tointensify the struggle against ... the common enemy.''   One Western diplomat speculated that the fighting within the 2ndArmy may have been ``a backlash against the rapprochement with theEPLF.''   The foreign minister said the coup leaders flew eliteparatroopers to Addis Ababa from Asmara, basing half at theinternational airport and the rest at an old airport converted to amilitary compound on the outskirts of the city.   On Tuesday, five of the ringleaders met at the Defense Ministry,Berhanu said, shortly after some of them had seen Mengistu off on astate visit to East Germany.   As they were meeting, Berhanu said, the defense minister, Maj.Gen. Haile Giorgis Habte Mariam, ``courageously confronted theplotters and was killed by one of them.''   Two of the coup leaders, both generals, were killed in asubsequent gunfight at the Defense Ministry, a third was capturedThursday in Addis Ababa and troops still are hunting for two more,Berhanu said.   He said the rebel paratroopers at the international airportsurrendered without resistance Wednesday, but those at the oldairport put up a 45-minute fight before they too gave up.   Mengistu abandoned his visit to East Germany and returned himWednesday night to crush the coup attempt.   With a clique of fellow army officers, Mengistu seized powerafter ousting Emperor Haile Selassie in a Sept. 12, 1974revolution. He inherited the northern insurrections from Selassie,who annexed Eritrea in 1962.</TEXT></DOC>
