The rule changes allow fishing in streamsand lakes in Rocky Mountain National Park as designated by the Superintendentpursuant to authority provided by National Park Service general regulations.The park's active monitoring program has identified preservation concernswhich include protecting and restoring native fish populations while affordinga high quality fishing experience within limits necessary to perpetuatefish populations and riparian vegetation. The changes to the regulationsaddress these concerns and will correct, on an annual basis, problems identifiedwith the current regulations. With these changes in place, the park staffwill be able to more effectively manage the fishery resources by manipulatingseason dates, bait and terminal gear restrictions, and the use of creellimits (including catch-and-release). Effects of the rules are expectedto be minimal. This rulemaking will not alter to any degree the numberof angler days presently occurring.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>David R.

They permit fishing in selected waters of the park witha variety of regulations for specific lakes and streams.Technical fishing assistance has been provided to Rocky Mountain NationalPark by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for 30 years. The present objectiveshave evolved since the late 1950s to closely coincide with the park's primarypurpose, which is to preserve natural environments and native plant andanimal life, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in ways thatmaintain natural conditions.Thus, the specific objectives of the park's fishery program are: 1. Protectand restore native fish populations, and meet the requirements of the EndangeredSpecies Act of 1973.2. Maintain a high quality fishing experience for the anglers.3. Allow angler use according to National Park Service policy, and withinlimits necessary to perpetuate fish populations and reparian vegetation.Attainment of these objectives requires that angler harvests do not alternatural replenishment rates or age structure, or significantly reduce numbers,biomass, or sizes, from those occurring in unfished populations. This managementpolicy necessitates both a philosophical and literal distinction betweenrecreational angling and removing fish for consumption.Protective policies of the National Park Service that have prevented significantdegradation of the aquatic habitat have also restricted the use of maintenancestocking in park waters. Given these constraints, special angling regulationshave become the primary means to accomplish park fishery objectives.Regulations used to protect fish and maintain angling quality have includedmanipulating season dates, bait and terminal gear restrictions, and theuse of creel limits (including catch-and-release).Of the 147 lakes within Rocky Mountain National Park, only 42 lakes arecapable of maintaining reproducing fish populations due to cold water temperaturesor lack of spawning habitat. Of the 42 lakes that sustain reproducing fishpopulations, 11 lakes and 11 streams contain pure populations of nativetrout species. The majority of these native fish populations were restoredsince 1973, under the Endangered Species Act.Because of the sensitivity of these native fish populations, the park staffmust be able to respond rapidly to changes that occur in a dynamic ecosystemresulting from human activities and natural events.The park's fishing regulations are currently codified in 36 CFR 7.7(a).In order for even minor changes to be made in these regulations throughnormal rulemaking procedures, approximately eight months are required.This process involves extensive review at various Government levels andincludes a period set aside for public review and comment.The new park fishing regulations allow the Superintendent the ability tomake routine changes in the regulations locally and in a timely manner,using discretionary authority provided by National Park Service generalregulations in 36 CFR 1.5. This procedure will afford greater protectionto the park's fishery resources, be more responsive to public needs andallow park managers greater flexibility to respond to specific situations.Public notice of restrictions established by the Superintendent will beprovided through signs, maps, brochures, newspaper notices or other appropriatemethods as required by 36 CFR 1.7. Detailed information pertaining to thenature and extent of fishing restrictions will be readily available toanglers in the park. Permanent or otherwise significant closures of parkwaters (such as the ones listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this rulemaking)are subject to the rulemaking requirements of 36 CFR 1.5(b) and will continueto be codified in 36 CFR 7.7.The National Park Service published a proposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 16, 1988 (53 FR 30849) and provideda 30-day period for public comments on the proposed revisions. No commentswere received. Therefore, the proposed rules are published unchanged, infinal. The park's fishing regulations will be reviewed at least annually by parkstaff and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and recommendations for changes,if any, will be made to the Superintendent. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The primary authors of these regulations are David Essex, Chief Park Ranger,and David Stevens, Research Biologist, both of Rocky Mountain NationalPark. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements thatrequire approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq. </T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With Other Laws </ITAG>The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 (February 19, 1981), 46 FR 13193,and certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effecton a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The economic effects of this rulemaking are local innature and negligible in scope. The National Park Service has determinedthat this rulemaking will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment, health, and safety because it is not expectedto: (a) Increase public angling to the extent of impacting the aquatic ecosystem;(b) Introduce noncompatible uses which might compromise the nature andcharacteristics of the area, or cause physical damage to it; (c) Conflict with adjacent ownerships or land uses; or (d) Cause a nuisance to adjacent owners or occupants. Based on this determination, this rulemaking is categorically excludedfrom the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA) by Departmental regulations in 516 DM 6 (49 FR 21438). As such,neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statementhas been prepared. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 7 </ITAG>National Parks; reporting and recordkeeping requirements.In consideration of the foregoing, 36 CFR Chapter I is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 7_SPECIAL REGULATIONS, AREAS OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM </ITAG>1.
