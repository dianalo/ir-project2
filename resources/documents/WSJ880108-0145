The Salomon Inc. unit's survey, by analyst James Crandell and research associate Douglas Reynolds, says companies are increasingly concerned about replacing reserves.    The budgeted increases are 12.4% for 19 major U.S. oil concerns, 19.9% for 97 U.S. independents, 20.6% for 41 concerns in Canada and 16.5% for 50 international companies. Big oil companies are continuing to switch their outlays to areas outside the U.S., the report noted.    Mr. Crandell said the majors will be drilling many areas in the Gulf of Mexico under leases taken out in 1983 under then Interior Secretary James Watt's area-wide leasing program. The companies must begin developing these areas this year or lose the rights to them, the analyst said.    Oil companies expect an average price of $18.20 a barrel for 1988, compared with $16 to $17 currently. A majority of companies indicated that an early-1988 drop to $15 wouldn't affect spending much if the price recovered by midyear, the report says. This is because many companies are focusing on natural-gas drilling and emphasizing the longer term, the report says. </TEXT></DOC>
