Unleaded and heating oil futures ended the day mixed.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,fell 19 cents to close at $17.93 a 42-gallon barrel. The contracthas fallen for six consecutive days and lost $1.58 since lastFriday when it cost $19.51 a barrel.   Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, Augustunleaded gasoline rebounded 0.97 cent to finish at 52.95 cents agallon. Gasoline prices had weakened steadily over the last fewweeks as consumption dropped due to exaggerated pump prices.   Gasoline contracts for delivery in September and October alsogained.   Domestic heating oil for August delivery dropped 1.03 cents to48.23 cents a gallon, while other contract months also recordeddeclines.   Analysts said crude oil broke through a psychologicallyimportant level of $18 as it continued to slide back to Februarylevels. The near-term contract last closed lower on Feb. 23 at$17.83 a barrel.   Bearish sentiment continued to plague the market in the face ofweakening demand and growing supplies, market observers said.   ``It's a combination of feeling that August refinery runs willbe lower and that OPEC is producing more than an ideal level,''said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at EldersFutures Inc.   Refineries have eased off near peak runs of earlier in thesummer as demand for gasoline slackened off in the last few weeks.Crude oil tends to pile up as refinery output slows.   Also, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries isbelieved producing at least 2 million barrels a day above itsself-imposed quota of 19.5 million barrels. OPEC set a newproduction ceiling recently in an attempt to stabilize prices forMiddle Eastern crude at $18 a barrel. Several of the 13-membergroup, however, are producing above their limits.   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc., said that crude prices could weakenfurther before they get better.   ``I don't think we'll see a price collapse,'' Lebow said. ``Aswe head into the third and fourth quarters, I think the market willshow signs of improvement.''   Analysts said Friday's gains in gasoline prices could continue.``We could start to see some increase in demand. After all, Augustis a big driving month,'' Beutel said.</TEXT></DOC>
