On a 63-33 vote Tuesday night and despite the desires of theBush administration, the Senate rejected cutting in half the 48percent to 67 percent tariffs on rubber-sole, canvas-top athleticshoes produced in the Caribbean.   To opponents, led by Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell ofMaine, the issue was jobs _ not shoes capitalizing on the TeenageMutant Ninja Turtles fad.   ``This amendment will destroy an industry (and) ... costhundreds if not thousands of jobs in this country,'' said Mitchell,citing 800 mostly elderly and women workers at New Balance andEtonic athletic shoe plants in his state.   The amendment by Sen. Bob Graham _ who held up a pair of $7.95Ninja Turtle shoes _ was defeated after Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,D-Texas, said its passage could kill a bill providing permanentduty-free status for most imports from the Caribbean and CentralAmerica.   ``The U.S. industry is on its knees and it's not fair to makematters worse,'' said Bentsen, who as chairman of the SenateFinance Committee is one of the most powerful voices in Congress ontrade issues.   The overall bill was approved later on a 92-0 vote after theSenate agreed to a further amendment banning imports from Burmaover alleged human rights violations.   It now goes to a conference committee with members of the House,where similar legislation making the Caribbean Basin Initiativepermanent was approved last year.   Graham and other supporters of his amendment argued it wouldshift jobs in the tennis shoe industry to the Caribbean from China,Korea, Taiwan and other Far East countries.   ``The question is not about whether jobs will be lost in theUnited States,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., ``The real debateis whether we're going to move production from mainland China ... acountry that massacres its students ... to struggling democraciesin the Caribbean.''   Packwood waved a pair of shoes that later were pointed out to beKorean-made.   Opponents, however, also waved various brands of tennis shoesproduced in their states and said the job-losers would be Americansrather than Chinese and Koreans.   They said 11,000 U.S. jobs have been lost since 1980, when halfof all shoes sold in this country were U.S.-made.   Today, with only 8,000 Americans still employed in shoemanufacturing, they said, imports now account for 82 percent of allshoes sold in the country and 74 percent of the athletic shoes.   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate approved several amendments,including one by Packwood that would prohibit the export of logsharvested on government-owned forest land.   The bill extends indefinitely the duty-free access of Caribbeangoods, an authority that otherwise would expire in 1995. It alsocontinues a variety of temporary duty suspensions for variouschemicals and manufacturing components not produced domestically.   In addition, the legislation lifts trade sanctions imposed in1985 against Nicaragua, including the restoration of a sugar quotaworth up to $33 million this year.   The 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative was intended to lift thedepressed economies of 24 Caribbean and Central American countriesthrough a combination of direct aid and an elimination of tariffsand quotas to encourage new export industries in the region.   Excluded from the duty-free program, however, were variousclassifications of textiles, clothing, luggage, shoes, dinnerware,leather products and other ``sensitive'' goods that competedirectly with U.S.-made products.</TEXT></DOC>
