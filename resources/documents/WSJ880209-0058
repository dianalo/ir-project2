By the close, some 36 million shares had declined in price on Nasdaq yesterday, while 26.8 million rose. In all, Nasdaq volume was moderate at 120.1 million shares.    Many of the declining shares were British stocks that trade on Nasdaq as American depository receipts. These are foreign stocks on deposit with trustee banks that in turn issue shares that trade on the Nasdaq system as U.S.-dollar denominated stock.    While the U.S. dollar slid a bit yesterday, it strengthened against the British pound, which was put under pressure by labor problems.    Among the more than 200 ADRs that trade on Nasdaq are dozens of British and other European and United Kingdom ADRs, many of them huge. By the close yesterday, Reuters, the British-based news service, was down 3 5/8 to 46 3/8 on volume of 1.2 million shares. Cadbury-Schweppes, the big British candy and soft drink maker, was off 1 7/8 to 41 1/4.    Among other British ADR's, English China fell 7/8 to 19 5/8; United Newspapers was off 1/2 to 14 1/2. Other United Kingdom issues also slipped, including Waterford, the Irish crystal maker, off 1/2 to 11; and Elan, a major drug concern, off 3/4 to 10.    Scandinavian ADRs were also hit yesterday to a lesser degree. Volvo, the car maker, slipped 5/8 to 50; Norsk Data, a big computer concern, was off 1/8 to 7 1/2; AB SKF, the Swedish electronics concern, fell 5/8 to 38.    In contrast, Japanese ADR's, Nasdaq's second largest group, were strong yesterday. The dollar slid a bit compared with the yen. Makita Electric, for example, rose 3/4 to 64 1/2.    Other big losers on Nasdaq yesterday largely resulted from technical factors unique to OTC trading. Traders said institutions were unloading small and medium-sized blocks of shares, many of them previously purchased at big discounts from OTC market makers in the weeks after last October's crash.    At that time, many OTC market makers were burdened with huge amounts of stock purchased from selling customers. Most were unable to find any buyers at all. As a result, huge institutions that had money to invest, such as Prudential Insurance Co. of America, were able to negotiate prices well below the already-collapsed level of many stock prices. And some of these holdings were among blocks being sold yesterday.    Yesterday some of these blocks changed hands below the so-called bid price for the individual OTC stocks. That caused a number of issues to appear depressed through much of the day's trading when the actual bid price, which is the lower price market makers pay for shares when they buy them, remained unchanged in ordinary trading.    Typically, First Commercial Bancorp appeared through much of the day to be the most depressed stock on Nasdaq, down 1/8 to 4 5/8. In reality, the bid and asked prices for the issue didn't change from 4 bid, 5 asked on Friday. According to traders, one institution sold 10,000 shares yesterday through A.G. Edwards. Those shares moved through the institutional Autex system used by the largest institutions at 3 3/4. In the last few minutes of trading, an additional 1,000 shares changed hands in ordinary trading at 4 5/8, and the issue closed the day at that price, down 1/8. </TEXT></DOC>
