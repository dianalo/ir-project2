But there was no way to ascertain whether Terry Anderson andThomas Sutherland, kidnapped in 1985, or any of the other Americancaptives who are believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists wereallowed to hear or read the messages.   ``I can hardly believe that your fifth Christmas season incaptivity is approaching,'' said Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, in aletter written in advance to coincide with Christmas.   ``Despite having no valid reason for believing that you mightcelebrate this season as a free man, my faith prompts me to prayvery hard for a Christmas miracle,'' she wrote.   The English text of her letter was published by the newspaperAn-Nahar along with an Arabic translation.   The conservative Al-Anwar, the pro-Syrian Ash-Sharq and theMoslem Al-Liwa published the Arabic translation of the letter, andradio and television stations broadcast the message in English.   ``We are counting on you to hold yourself together physically,spiritually and emotionally until your day of freedom comes,'' Mrs.Say wrote to Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press.   ``Until then, stay strong and know that neither you nor thoseheld with you are alone or forgotten. Your daughters are as always,well and beautiful.''   Anderson has two daughters, Gabrielle, 13, and Sulome, 4. Theyounger daughter was born three months after he was kidnapped onMarch 16, 1985.   Anderson, 42, of Lorain, Ohio, is the longest-held of the 18Western captives in Lebanon.   He and Sutherland, 58, of Fort Collins, Colo., are held byIslamic Jihad, or Holy War, an extremist group seeking the releaseof 15 comrades jailed in Kuwait on terrorist charges.   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut, was kidnapped June 9, 1985.   One newspaper, the leftist As-Safir, published a paidadvertisement in Arabic and English carrying the message toSutherland.   It was signed by his wife, Jean, his daughters Ann, Simone, Kit,and Joan and the Murray and Sutherland families.   ``May this find you and bring all the gifts we have of love,hope, comfort, and spirit,'' the letter said. ``We wait for you _we exist, we do not live without you.''   The newspapers also published a letter from the JournalistsCommittee to Free Terry Anderson that was addressed to all eightAmericans.   The six others are Frank Reed, Joseph Cicippio, Edward AustinTracy, Alann Steen, Jesse Turner and Robert Polhill.   ``We had hoped and prayed that this Christmas would be differentfrom the others and we'd see you all home,'' said the letter signedby Bill Foley and Cary Vaughan for the committee.   It concluded: ``Someday, someway, you will come home.''   The other foreign hostages in Lebanon include four Britons, twoWest Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.</TEXT></DOC>
