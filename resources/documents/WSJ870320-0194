That's not so. In 1986 business investment in Louisiana totaled more than $2.9 billion. Nearly $1 billion in new investment has already been announced for 1987. Investment in manufacturing over the past 10 years is more than $20 billion.    Despite the article's comments to the contrary, Louisiana workers in 1986 were deemed good enough by Boeing to locate a major facility in southwest Louisiana that will employ 1,400. And Martin Marietta has selected New Orleans as the site at which it will fabricate modules for the space station if it is the successful bidder on that project. Also, in the past few weeks Rockwell International has announced plans to move one of its electronics subsidiaries from Texas to northwest Louisiana.    As to workers of Cajun descent, they are capable enough and motivated enough to hold the bulk of the jobs in the offshore oil-exploration industry where the average wage approaches $30,000 a year. In addition, it was a task force of several thousand Cajuns that helped establish the offshore oil and gas industry in the North Sea, as they had done earlier in the Gulf of Mexico.    We in Louisiana are aware of the importance of education. It is the reason the state allocates nearly one of every three tax dollars to support our schools. It is also the reason we created a $2 billion trust fund for education -- the largest fund of its kind in the U.S. -- and have already deposited the first half-billion in the program.    We know more has to be done, but we aren't alone in our concern. Some 20 other states have also declared education to be the number one priority. This is not an isolated problem and certainly not one unique to Louisiana. Rather it is the result of a long-term decline in American education. In view of the pervasiveness of the problem, I don't know why Louisiana was singled out for your article, but I do know that we are one state that is attempting to do something about it.    Edwin Edwards   Governor of Louisiana   Baton Rouge   ---   The oil companies came in with the big bucks. The people and politicians of Louisiana fell for it. No matter how good the education system is, if students don't want to learn, nothing can change it.    The problems started when the oil-field jobs replaced education as the most important part of our lives. During the rise of oil, people quit school. There was no need for education when one could earn $25,000 to $50,000 a year in the oil field. Now the uneducated parents of our state cannot help their children with third-grade schoolwork.    As a graduate of the Louisiana school system, I got out of it what I put into it. It was up to me if I wanted an education.    Mr. Elliman of Lucas CAV Ltd. states that Louisiana doesn't have employees with the basic skills needed to adapt to change. I wonder if he knows who designed and built the giant offshore oil and gas platforms that provide heat and fuel for his house or business. If Lucas CAV Ltd. came to Louisiana, maybe my two brothers (both engineers) could work in Louisiana instead of Alabama and Massachusetts.    Roy A. Laundry   Houma, La.</TEXT></DOC>
