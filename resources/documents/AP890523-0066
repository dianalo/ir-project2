Authorities said 300people were arrested.   Thousands of riot troops in green combat fatigues blanketed thecenter of Seoul, standing guard along main streets and ringing theU.S. Embassy and key government buildings. Students who tried toattend the rally at city hall were seized and there were no reportsof any incidents.   Police headquarters said about 300 radicals were arrested butmost would be released later.   Troops conducted spot checks on many streets, questioning andsearching people and taking away suspects. Police patrols roamedsubway stations in the city center to stop students from gathering.   Radical students staged peaceful campus protests earlier todayat 16 colleges in Seoul on the second day of a week ofanti-American protests. Students marched or held rallies, but therewere no reports of fighting.   Students at Sungkyunkwang University tried to push through linesof riot police, but were held back. Students from the school stageda protest march dressed as skeletons and microbes to symbolize U.S.nuclear and chemical weapons.   ``Drive out the Yankees'' and ``Down with the dictatorship,''protesters chanted.   The Foreign Ministry issued a strong statement today criticizingradical students for burning U.S. flags at campus protests onMonday. Ministry spokesman Chang Hoon said such acts must stop.   ``Defaming a nation's flag is a deplorable act,'' he said.   Student groups called for a week of protests in Seoul and othercities to demand the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops based inSouth Korea under a mutual defense treaty. Radical leaders claimthe United States helps prop up authoritarian rule in South Korea.   Other radical demands include an end to U.S. trade pressure toopen South Korean markets to American imports. The radicals alsowant the United States to apologize for the bloody suppression of a1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.   The uprising in Kwangju was put down by South Korean troops withthe deaths of at least 192 people, but radical groups claim theUnited States masterminded the operation.   Dissidents and radical students are calling for the overthrow ofPresident Roh Tae-woo's government. But the radicals lacksignificant public support due to their violent tactics and extremeviews.   The dissidents contend the United States props up the Rohgovernment to enforce its control over South Korea. Radicalstudents contend U.S. troops are blocking reunification withcommunist North Korea.   South Korean and U.S. officials say American forces are neededto ensure the south's defense against North Korea. U.S. troops havebeen based in the south since north invaded in 1950.</TEXT></DOC>
