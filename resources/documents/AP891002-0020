Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley predicted Sunday thatthe House probably will vote this week to repeal the Medicarecatastrophic health care coverage that it enacted only last year.   ``I hope personally that the program is retained on a modifiedform,'' Foley, D-Wash., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program.``But ... there are a great number of Republicans and someDemocrats in the House who are in favor of repeal. If I wereguessing today, I think it probably would be repealed.''   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, also appearingon NBC, likened the House-passed version of Bush's cut in capitalgains taxes to the cocaine-based drug crack and said flatly thatthe Senate will not enact it.   ``It is so bad, so wrong for the economy,'' he said. ``It willdo for the deficit what crack does for the user: a quick short highfollowed by a long, painful depression.''   The Senate Finance Committee plans this week to consider analternative proposed by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and endorsedby a majority of Senate Democrats which would instead restorepartial tax deductibility for contributions to IndividualRetirement Accounts.   In other congressional action this week:   _The House will take up a long-awaited bill to protect thenation's waterways from oil spills similar to the Exxon-Valdeztanker accident in March that dumped 10 million gallons of crudeinto Alaska's Prince William Sound.   _Negotiations continue between House and Senate conferees on adozen appropriations bills needed to finance government programs infiscal 1990, which began Sunday. A major sticking point is how muchthe government will spend on Star Wars in fiscal 1990: The Senatehas appropriated $3.7 billion but the House wants to spend only$3.1 billion.   _Competing child care measures, both targeted primarily tolow-income families but one with the potential of being expanded toeventually subsidize day care for the middle class as well, will beconsidered by the House.   _The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment andhousing continues its investigation into scandals at the Departmentof Housing and Urban Development with a return appearance byself-described influence-peddler Paul Manafort.   Mitchell said Sunday he is positive that the 27-month capitalgains tax cut approved by the House last week will not win passagein the Senate.   However, he said Bush's ``irresponsible position ... makes itextremely difficult to prevent any tax cut from occurring.''   The House-passed measure would reduce from 33 percent to 19.6percent the maximum tax rate on profits from the sale of stocks andother investments until 1992. The rate would then climb back up to28 percent with assets indexed so that any gains attributed toinflation after that point would not be taxed.   Economists predict the cut will generate some $9.4 billion indeficit-reduction revenues over the next three years. After then,revenue would fall and worsen the deficit by a total of $21 billionover the following five years, according to the Congress' JointCommittee on Taxation.   ``I'm confident that this so-called yo-yo _ on two years, offtwo years _ and the way in which it's constructed cannot pass,''Mitchell said.   Mitchell acknowledged that many Democrats favor enacting adifferential for taxing such profits at rates less than those forwages, interest or dividends.   ``Whether or not they will coalesce behind any plan along withRepublicans, I don't know,'' he said. ``It will be very close onsome other plan.''   Regarding catastrophic health care, Mitchell said he isconfident the Senate will retain key benefits under the program,although it may change how they are financed. The administrationhas opposed changing or repealing the program.   The wealthier among the 33 million elderly Americans covered bythe program have balked at having to pay premiums this year of upto $800 to cover the hospital and physicians' bills for those withlower incomes.   Foley also said Congress likely will not complete action by anOct. 16 deadline on a deficit-reduction bill, which would includeany tax measure or changes in catastrophic care coverage.   That is the date when broad spending cuts in both military anddomestic programs will be triggered automatically unless Congresscomes up with $6 billion in new revenues or programs for fiscal1990.   ``We might have some few days in which there would be atechnical sequestration, that is an across-the-board cuttingthrough executive order of all the accounts ...,'' Foley said. ``Idon't think that's going to be a permanent situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
