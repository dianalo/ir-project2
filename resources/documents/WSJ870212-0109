The agency originally granted the permit in 1985 but suspended it last March after learning that the microbes had been injected into trees in the open air. The EPA said that action violated federal regulations requiring a permit for testing in the open. The agency also claimed that the company falsified data to conceal the open-air test, a charge the company denied.    The disclosure of the open-air tests last year touched off a furor that for a time seemed to portend trouble for the entire biotechnology industry. Some critics expressed doubts about the government's ability to regulate the emerging field of genetic engineering, and others used the incident as ammunition for a new attack on the industry.    The currently proposed field tests are designed to demonstrate that the microbes can lower by a few degrees the temperature at which frost forms on strawberry blossoms.    The EPA said Advanced Genetic has provided new data demonstrating that the microbes won't harm plants on which it has been tested. The agency dropped its final barrier to the permit yesterday when it also approved three potential sites in California for the field experiments, two in San Benito County and one in Contra Costa County.    Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends -- a Washington environmental group -- and an opponent of genetic engineering, disputed the EPA's conclusions on the risk of plant damage. He asserted that advanced genetic's data show &quot;sensitivity&quot; to the microbe in one in four peach branches. He also said that some plants in the target sites weren't tested, including some endangered species.    Mr. Rifkin said he is organizing opposition to the tests at the local level in California. He said he plans to sue in a California state court to block the tests.    The Advanced Genetic test was the first ever approved by the EPA for a genetically engineered microbe. The agency also has granted a permit to a University of California scientist to test a similar, frost-retarding microbe. But neither test has been conducted.    According to the EPA and the Industrial Biotechnology Association, both tests still need to win clearance from the State of California, where they are slated to take place.    Advocates of biotechnology claim it has a powerful capacity to increase plant and animal yields, develop new pest-resistant strains and render unnecessary toxic pesticides that currently harm farm workers and taint groundwater in many areas.    Some observers say the problems with Advanced Genetic's permit have had a chilling effect on the willingness of biotechnology companies to move into field testing. Alan Goldhammer, Director of Technical Affairs for the Biotechnology Association, said product development simply may have taken &quot;a lot longer than expected.&quot; Regardless, he said, the first permitted test will be &quot;a landmark&quot; to demonstrate &quot;the benefits we've long talked about for this technology.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Advanced Genetic's shares closed at $4, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
