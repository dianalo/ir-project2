In Saturday's protest, more than 10,000 people gathered inWenceslas Square to mark the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovakindependence. Police beat several dozen people and arrested 355,including 17 foreigners.   The demonstrators called repeatedly for free elections, a newgovernment, and the resignation of Communist Party leader MilosJakes. His popularity is said by informed Czechs to be sliding evenwithin Communist ranks.   The rally was the first in which such strident calls for a newleadership were heard.   ``Our (leadership) power is much more isolated after the changesin East Germany,'' noted Jiri Hajek, a former foreign minister andnow a leading activist with the Charter 77 human rights group. ``Itis still strong and monolithic in Czechoslovakia, but they feelmore alone.''   The conviction that change is coming has grown markedly inPrague in the last two months, buoyed by the dramatic upheaval inEast Germany, the emergence of a non-Communist government in Polandand Hungary's bold moves toward democracy.   But Czechoslovaks have not suffered the privations endured byPolish, Hungarian and East German consumers, and many apparentlyare unwilling to risk economic problems in exchange for politicalchange.   Fear of losing material possessions coveted and gained by manyCzechs and Slovaks _ a car, a country cottage, a videocassetteplayer _ is the great brake on popular protest, said dissidentVaclav Maly, a Roman Catholic priest.   In addition, the government in the past year has loosenedrestrictions on travel to the West and permitted freer expressionin the arts.   To date, there has been no stimulus to mass protest like in EastGermany, where more than 50,000 people have fled to the West sinceAugust. With a tradition of caution and peaceful change, manyCzechs and Slovaks are not convinced that street demonstrations arethe way to achieve reform.   This caution makes them wary of striking out for change whilethey perceive no strong leadership in the 30-odd opposition groups.Banned playwright and activist Vaclav Havel is virtually the onlynationally known figure in the ragged movement.   Moreover, Czechs and Slovaks for centuries have resisted theirrulers from other, larger nations with wit and ridicule, ratherthan arms.   ``Czechs are able to resist, but not to sacrifice so much,''Maly said. ``We struggled spiritually.''   The shock of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion to crush Praguespring reforms is also deeply etched in the memory ofCzechoslovaks, said Dana Nemcova of Charter 77.   ``People really hoped then and then suddenly suffered a blow,''she noted. The ensuing two decades of ``normalization,'' as it isofficially known, have left many citizens very skeptical aboutchange.   ``The people are very discontented but feel powerless,'' shesaid. ``They don't think words can change anything _ they've heardso many words .... But especially young people are active, and theyhave decided to struggle for their future.''   Prague abounds with talk of mini-revolts inside the only twoparties officially permitted by the ruling Communists, the People'sParty and the Socialist Party.   In the past, these two parties ``were instruments of theCommunist party,'' noted Maly. Now with calls for genuine democracyappearing in both parties and in their daily newspapers, ``that isnot so true.''</TEXT></DOC>
