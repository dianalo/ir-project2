Itsphysics goals include the systematic study of jets, bottom-quark andlepton physics and search/study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and quarkcompositeness. The physics requirements for measurements are definedand various experimental techniques are analyzed with some emphasis ontriggering requirements. On this basis a detector scheme is synthesizedand various types of triggers are considered. Finally, possible measurementsat a higher luminosity (L=10**34/cm**2/sec) are briefly discussed aswell as R and D effort needed.</TEXT></DOC>
