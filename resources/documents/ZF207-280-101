 How arewe going to survive when every member of society is going to have to spend somuch time learning how this thing works?&quot;andP;  Society had not yet created thefilters to buffer itself from the overwhelming impact of its technology.andP;  Nowthat we have the filters -- like garage mechanics and diagnostic centers, inthe case of the automobile -- we can drive our cars without worrying too muchabout how they work.andM;The filters and buffers for the information age are the kinds of hypermediasystems discussed in this issue.andP;  They provide ways in which we can go onexpanding human knowledge but at the same time prevent it from overwhelmingus or leaving us isolated or totally ignorant because we don't happen to havea doctorate in a particular subject.andM;It's all Descartes' fault.andP;  He gave us the reductionist way of dealing withinformation and fragmented knowledge beyond anybody's grasp.andP;  The Renaissanceman is long gone, but with things like HyperCard applications and expertsystems, there's a chance we can pull ourselves out of the avalanche offragments of information and survive.andM;When I was a little kid, I used to play a game with the encyclopedias.andP;  I'dlook up something and see what it linked to.andP;  Then I'd look that up and seewhat that linked to -- from Aristotle to the trajectory of cannon balls, fromcannon balls to the Eniac computer developed for ballistics calculations --pretty soon I'd find myself after five o'clock with my other asking if I'ddone my homework.andP;  That's how powerful hypermedia can be.andM;Everything links to everything else.andP;  If you don't believe it, try a littleexperiment.andP;  Take a thesaurus (like Word Finder on the Mac, or Roget's in theold-fashioned paper edition).andP;  Pick any two words at random -- like horse androtate -- and see how long it takes to chain from the first to the second,using a trail of synonyms.andP;  From horse to nag (&quot;an old horse&quot;), from nag (asin &quot;pester&quot;) to ride (as in &quot;ride roughsod&quot;), from ride (as in &quot;go for aride&quot;) to spin (&quot;take it for a spin&quot;), and on to rotate.andP;  Only four links inthis particular chain.andM;If we could ever plumb the depths of language, it would create an altogethernew type of human-computer interface.andP;  But natural language is such agigantic problem that even those geniuses up at MIT are beginning to say,&quot;Well, maybe not just yet.&quot;andM;If you try to work out even what simple statements apparently mean or couldmean, or the number of ways somebody could mean something by a relativelysimple statement, you realize how unbelievably vast the phenomenon of naturallanguage is.andP;  If I say &quot;Johnny got some new toys today.andP;  He was opening thebox when you came in,&quot; there's absolutely nothing in that statement to tellyou what &quot;the box&quot; is, but you know with absolute certainty what I mean.andM;Where's the data?andP;  It's not there -- and yet it is.andM;Or suppose I ask you: &quot;What does mother mean?&quot;andP;  Put this magazine down andthink about what that word is.andP;  Well, I'd be waiting until next year; thesemantic linkages could stop anybody in their tracks.andP;  If we could tap intothat, it would be really exciting.andP;  That would be Interactive Multimedia witha capital I and a capital M.andP;  And it ought to be possible.andM;But for the moment, natural language lies outside the reach of computers.andO;Which is why the Mac's flexible blend of language, graphics, and spatialinteractiveness is so important in harnessing the power of hypermedia.andO;Whichever side of your brain is in charge, at least one of those two sides --the spatial, holistic right brain or the linear, analytical left brain -- isgoing to be all right with the Mac.andM;THE SHAMAN'S LAPTOPandM;Actually, icon-based computing devices are nothing new.andP;  In fact, they mayhave played a role in humans' evolutionary transformation from Neanderthal toHomo sapiens.andP;  Paleontologists have unearthed bones and antlers on which verysmall carvings have been made.andP;  These artifacts date back more than 30,000years.andP;  The earliest one had meanders -- wiggly parallel lines withapparently ritualistic meaning.andP;  Between 30,000 and 15,000 B.C., the meandersgave way to much more sophisticated systems of notation.andM;One such artifact, called the Montgaudier Baton, has what appears to be acalendar from March to November, the months between the thaw and the freezewhen you could get out of the cave.andP;  It also has a number of carvings ofsalmon and seal.andP;  For a time, no one could figure out why there would besalmon and seal in Montgaudier, a hundred miles from the sea.andP;  Then theylooked closely at the salmon carvings; they were tiny little things, and theshape of the fish showed that they were in the spawning stage.andP;  And, ofcourse, in spawning they come up the rivers.andP;  The seals chase them up therivers, so that's how somebody 100 miles from the sea saw salmon.andM;And 30,000 chronological years and a light-year of culture away, we can makesense of the user-friendly Montgaudier Baton, even without a manual.andM;These devices made it possible to hunt more efficiently and to tell others ofthe capabilities they had.andP;  So they survived because they could communicatein a more complex way.andP;  They could also say, &quot;The next time the moon comesup, fellows, that's when we go out and get the salmon.&quot;andP;  That way you eatsalmon instead of berries.andP;  Next week, caviar.andM;These extraordinary devices are the closest thing you can get to proof thatHomo sapiens had arrived.andP;  They indicate a cognitive ability on par with themodern brain.andP;  In other words, Homo sapiens had come and displacedNeanderthal because of greater cognitive abilities.andM;The disappearance of Neanderthals suggests a parable for modern people.andO;There's a place in Israel where Neanderthals and Homo sapiens apparentlylived close enough together to breed, but they didn't.andP;  Home sapiens wereclearly different from Neanderthal.andP;  Homo sapiens' linguistic and cognitiveabilities allowed them to pass on their knowledge culturally through the useof language.andP;  The Neanderthals weren't grunting apes: They had rituals thatindicated their belief in life after death, they took care of the young, andthey paved their own hearths against damage by fire.andP;  But they weresuperseded by a species that was better equipped to store, communicate, anduse information to help it withstand the hazards of life in the Ice Age.andM;BACK TO THE PRESENTandM;Unless we begin to make some urgently needed changes in our educationalsystems, we'll be heading towards a similar split between two classes ofsociety: the information-rich and information-poor.andP;  Even well-intendedefforts to teach children to write computer programs are absurdly going aboutthings in the wrongest possible way.andM;Imagine if in Gutenberg's time we had been teaching children to typesetinstead of to read, and yet here we are doing just that.andO;Computer-program-writing skills will soon be as unnecessary as printingskills.andP;  Even though there are already programs that write programs, we'restill treating computers as if they were things for which people should learnto write programs, instead of learning to demand of them what people demandedof books when they came out.andP;  And I believe that the coming revolution inmultimedia computing is going to make what happened with Gutenberg look likenothing.andM;TECHNOLOGIES OF FREEDOMandM;For educators, the potential of interactive video working together withHyperCard is a very exciting thing.andP;  The job of the educational system upuntil now, it seems to me, has been to fail people, not to educate them.andO;Fail the majority so you can teach a few.andP;  Society simply has not been ableto do more than that because it hasn't had the tools and systems to do muchmore than what they did in the Middle Ages: Teach a few people and fail themajority.andM;In modern times, the majority aren't failed in the sense of receiving failinggrades; they've been failed in the sense of not being encouraged to live upto their potential.andP;  I have this utopian dream that is born of the fact thatneurophysiologically we are all about equal.andP;  We all have, give or take, ahundred billion neurons in there, and unless we have some kind of disease orother defect, most of us have roughly the same kind of brain that Einsteinhad.andM;Hypermedia systems could enhance, liberate, and augment human intellect, actas releasers and facilitators of what people already have in their heads.andO;But first we've got to develop the hardware and software and get this stuffinto the classrooms as soon as possible, and give these webs of ideas tochildren and just say &quot;play.&quot;andP;  Think of the freedom it's going to giveteachers to indulge in a Socratic dialogue and stop wasting everyone's timeputting junk data -- which is out of date before it can be used -- into theirstudents' heads.andM;The need for education goes beyond the traditional classroom.andP;  In the nearfuture, we're all going to have to recycle our knowledge about every 10 yearsto keep up with our jobs.andP;  There is a colossal pool of talent lying aroundout there in everybody's brains that we have not been able to make sociallyvaluable use of until now, thanks to the communications andinformation-processing tools that the late Ithiel de Sola Pool described asthe &quot;technologies of freedom.&quot;andM;To keep up, we'll have to recycle our knowledge every 10 years.andM;Hypermedia will also have an impact on larger sociopolitical structures.andO;These changes could be more massive than anything in history.andP;  Back in thelate 1960s, I interviewed the man who ran the Soviet space effort.andP;  At onepoint, he said, &quot;I have a nightmare,&quot; adnd he used a term that we would nowcall a personal computer.andP;  That was his nightmare, because one thetechnologies of freedom start to leak, you can't get them back in the bag.andM;Could a monolithic state structure withstand hypermedia?andP;  I doubt it.andP;  Itinvites too much thinking.andP;  It invites too much dissent, because that'sprecisely what it's for.andP;  It says, &quot;See what you can think of.andP;  See how manyways you can go.&quot;andM;Until modern times, the evolution of life on the planet -- including humans-- was driven by our ability to cope with and exploit the energy and naturalresources around us: to adapt to the environment, create tools, andperpetuate the species.andP;  In the future, the ability to navigate and useinformation will be the hallmark and future of humankind.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
