 In general, if the databaserequirements exceed what the spreadsheets can handle, then thenext step up is a flat-file database program that can handleextensive amounts of data.andP;  Beyond these, there are relationaldatabases that can work with multiple database tables.andP;  Somem typical database applications are described in order to presentthe limitations imposed by 1-2-3 and Symphony and to helpprospective customers in selecting a database program.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Lotus 1-2-3 (Spreadsheet software) (usage)Symphony (Integrated software) (usage).andO;Topic:     Data Base Management SystemsRelational Data BasesSoftware SelectionTutorial.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CHOOSE THE RIGHT DATABASE PROGRAMandM;Because LOTUS magazine exists primarily to extend the value of the softwareyou already own, this special report focuses mainly on 1-2-3 and Symphony.andO;Yet, depending on the nature of your database application, those programs mayor may not meet your needs.andP;  So before we dive into our coverage of 1-2-3 andSymphony, we begin our report by helping you determine when to use Lotus'sprograms and when to choose an alternative.andP;  If your application requiresthat you look elsewhere, be sure to consider the database add-ins cataloguedin our article on page 81.andM;To start our discussion, imagine that you have an application that requiresyou to set up and manage a database.andP;  If you own 1-2-3 or Symphony, eitherproduct is a natural place to start your search for a database program.andP;  Bothproducts contain a database manager that you've already paid for.andP;  Further,if your database will either use spreadsheet data or generate data you wishto use in a spreadsheet, using 1-2-3 or Symphony eliminates any need totransfer the data between separate database and spreadsheet programs.andM;But 1-2-3 and Symphony have limits as database programs.andP;  If your applicationexceeds those limits, you should turn to one of two other types of databaseprograms.andP;  One type consists of programs that work with one database table ata time.andP;  This type is known as a flat-file database program.andP;  SymantecCorp.'s Qandamp;A and Borland International's Reflex are examples of this kind ofprogram.andP;  The other type can work with multiple database tables and is knownas a relational database program.andP;  Ashton-Tate's dBase and Microrim's R:Baseare two examples.andM;Matching your application to the right kind of database program is a crucialdecision.andP;  Buy too simple a program and either you won't get the job done, oryou'll spend days writing macros or programs to circumvent the software'sdeficiencies.andP;  If your application later changes, you may not be able torevise your macros or program adequately to handle its new scope.andP;  With toosophisticated a database program, you'll probably pay too much and saddleyourself with complexity that you don't need.andM;This article describes a series of typical database applications that aresimilar to ones you may face in the future.andP;  Those applications will help youto understand the limitations imposed by each program.andP;  Let's begin with anapplication you can handle by using 1-2-3 or Symphony.andM;A Simple ApplicationandM;Let's suppose your company needs a customer-credit database.andP;  You have 600customers, and you need to know four things about each of them company name,identification number, amount owed, and credit status.andP;  You have to enter thenames of new customers, modify customer data, rapidly access thecredit-status information, and print three reports.andP;  One report is a list ofcustomers whose accounts are delinquent.andP;  It is sorted by the amount owed.andO;The other two reports are listings of customer information, one sorted bycompany name, the other by the identification number.andM;So far, your company's application appears to be a good candidate for 1-2-3or Symphony.andP;  But there's only one way to know: Build a simple prototype tosee if your solution works.andP;  That's easy to do.andP;  For example, you could enterthe field names, define the basic ranges of the database, enter a few samplerecords, and copy the records in order to build a database of 600 records.andO;Then do the same things with this database that you need to do with the realdatabase.andP;  For example, enter customer names, retrieve credit-statusinformation, and produce reports.andP;  If the prototype does what you want, clearthe sample data and proceed with confidence.andM;If any of the operations you test with the prototype don't work well, youmight try to fix things with macros.andP;  But using a dedicated database programmay be a better solution.andP;  That's not to say that you shouldn't write macros.andO;Just be wary of solutions that require extensive macros to simulate featuresavailable in other database programs.andM;Just how much can this application grow before it overwhelms 1-2-3 orSymphony?andP;  The answer depends on which release you use.andP;  To find yourprogram's limits, let's consider a variation on this application.andP;  Yourmanager has requested a more extensive database.andP;  She wants you to store upto 10,000 entries, to track 70 fields of information for each customer, andto produce mailing labels and form letters.andP;  She also wants 30 customreports.andM;Beyond the LimitsandM;This application violates the first limits imposed by either 1-2-3 Release2.01 or 2.2 or Symphony, namely physical size.andP;  In any of these programs, youmust store your database in the worksheet, which would suggest you couldstore up to 8,192 separate entries, or records.andP;  However, you must allow oneline for all the field names, which in our earlier example include companyname, identification number, amount owed, and credit status.andM;In 1-2-3 Releases 2.01 and 2.2 and in all releases of Symphony, not only mustyour database reside on the worksheet but the worksheet must fit intoavailable memory.andP;  You'll usually run out of memory before you fill 8,191rows.andM;To give you an idea of what you can fit on your worksheet, do the following.andO;While in a blank worksheet, press slash, select Worksheet Status (inSymphony, press SERVICES and select Settings), and note how much availablememory you have.andP;  Then enter a database of your own, extract some records toan Output range, and check memory again.andM;In 1-2-3 Release 3 memory limits are less important.andP;  Some programs, known asDataLens drivers, let Release 3 store records on the disk and then querythem.andP;  The sample driver that accompanies Release 3 lets you do that withdBase III Plus files.andP;  Oracle Corp. offers a driver that lets you store dataas an Oracle file and lets you query Oracle files.andP;  And Gupta Technologiesmakes a program that does the same for files in Gupta's database file format.andO;Keep in mind, however, that if you use Release 3 to query such a file, theresults must fit on the worksheet.andP;  Also, you can sort the data only while itresides on the worksheet.andM;For more about Release 3's database capabilities, consult &quot;Query ExternalTables with 1-2-3 Release 3&quot; on page 70.andM;Even if you were faced with many fewer records and thus no memory problem,this application might not work in 1-2-3 or Symphony because of its 70 fieldsof data.andP;  That many fields is no problem for 1-2-3 Release 3 or Symphony 2.0,which can handle up to 256 fields.andP;  But in 1-2-3 Releases 2.01 and 2.2 and inSymphony Release 1.2, you are limited to a maximum of 32 fields.andM;A final consideration regarding this application's suitability for 1-2-3 orSymphony is the need for custom reports.andP;  You can use Symphony to generateform letters, mailing labels, and custom reports such as invoices.andP;  But youneed a macro to create form letters or mailing labels from 1-2-3, and customreports may require extensive macro programming.andM;So for a lot of reasons, this type of application calls for a stand-aloneprogram that has been optimized for database management.andP;  In this case, wehave assumed that all of the data is in a single table.andP;  So it would appearthat a flat-file program can do the job.andM;Indeed, a competent flat-file program can store 65,000 records or more.andP;  Manyof these programs can handle at least 128 fields.andP;  And most of them will helpeven a novice user design a customized report in a matter of minutes.andP;  Afteryou set up a report in such a program, you can store its settings along withthe settings for producing many other reports.andP;  You can then select thereport settings you want from a menu.andM;The reason that a dedicated database program can store so many records isthat it does not try to store them all in memory as 1-2-3--prior to Release3--and Symphony do.andP;  Instead it uses both RAM and the disk together.andM;Because a database program uses the disk, you will probably note asignificant delay while data moves to and from the disk, especially when youwork with large databases.andP;  The speed at which your database responds dependson the file's size, the speed of both your computer and your hard disk, andwhich database program you choose.andP;  Because such delays can be annoying,you'll do well to test whether the program you're considering works fastenough with the number of records you expect to use.andM;Many flat-file database managers let you index your file.andP;  Indexing issimilar to sorting, but it lets you see your file in a rearranged sequencemuch more rapidly than if you were to sort the file.andP;  The larger yourdatabase, the more important indexing will be to you.andP;  In some of theseprograms, you can store multiple indexes and switch among them at will.andP;  Andin some programs, indexing can screen out duplicate entries.andM;Relationships Among TablesandM;If your aspirations for this application go even higher, you should probablyconsider a relational database program.andP;  With such a program, you can storein one table general information about a customer, such as the company nameand address.andP;  In other tables you can store the records of ordering andbilling transactions.andP;  You can then generate reports that draw on data storedin more than one of those tables.andM;For example, you might combine order data with names and addresses to produceshipping labels for each order.andP;  Or you might combine order data, names, andoustanding balances to produce a report of any unpaid bills owed by those whohave orders pending.andM;Without a relational database program, you have to duplicate a great deal ofyour data.andP;  For example, if you want to print a shipping label for eachorder, you have to enter the customer's name and address for each label.andP;  Ina relational program, you merely enter in a separate table the name, address,and identification number of each customer.andP;  Each time a customer places anorder, you enter the customer identification number and the order.andP;  When thetime comes to print labels for the order, the database program uses thecustomer ID number in the order table to retrieve the customer's name andaddress from the customer table.andM;Another deficiency of a flat-file program emerges when you need to storesubsequent orders from the same customer.andP;  If you try to put all the ordersin the same record, you have to create a separate field for each order.andP;  Andyou must reserve the same number of fields for the customer who orders leastfrequently as you do for the customer who orders most frequently.andP;  In somedatabase programs, all those empty fields tie up a lot of disk space.andO;Further, locating a particular order is cumbersome.andP;  With orders spread overseveral fields, it's hard to know which field to search.andM;To make matters even more difficult, suppose one of your product'sdescriptions has changed.andP;  For that change to be reflected throughout thedatabase, you have to hunt down each occurrence of that description--everyinvoice, purchase order, and inventory table--and change it.andP;  With arelational database, a product description appears just once, in a table ofproduct descriptions and specifications, where you can change it easily.andM;Combine and ConquerandM;Now that you're acquainted with each type of database, consider thepossibility of using more than one type together.andP;  Since 1-2-3 and Symphonyafford you analytical features absent in most dedicated database packages,sometimes the solution is to use a dedicated database program and 1-2-3 orSymphony.andP;  You may be able to transfer data between them using the Translateutility.andP;  Or you can store the results of your work with a database programin an ASCII file and then import that file into the worksheet using the FileImport command.andP;  You can later export it to the database from the worksheetby printing it to a PRN file.andM;As you know from the earlier discussion of Release 3 and DataLens drivers,you might be able to use Release 3 to import and export the data with lessfuss, depending on the dedicated database program you choose.andM;Once you know the type of database program you need, you can safely moveahead on choosing a particular product.andP;  Making that decision requires thatyou consider compatibility with your other software, how easy the program isto use, and any applicable software standards within your company.andP;  If you'rethinking about an add-in database for 1-2-3 or Symphony, see the article&quot;Database Add-Ins for 1-2-3.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
