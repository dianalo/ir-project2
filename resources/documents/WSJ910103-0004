The drug, called erythropoietin (EPO), may be especiallyhelpful to many people with AIDS who can't take the drug AZTbecause it causes severe anemia for them.</LP><TEXT>   The drug is a genetically engineered version of a naturalhuman protein made by the kidney that stimulates the body'ssupply of red blood cells. In 1989, the Food and DrugAdministration gave Amgen Inc. approval to sell EPO under thename Epogen. Analysts said Epogen had sales of about $275million in 1990, making EPO the biggest selling drug yet tobe produced by the biotechnology industry.   Under an agreement between Amgen and Johnson andamp; Johnson,Amgen has the U.S. rights to sell EPO only for use intreating patients who have anemia as a result of kidneyproblems and who require regular dialysis treatments. OrthoPharmaceutical Corp., a division of Johnson andamp; Johnson, hasthe right to sell its brand of the drug, called Procrit, forall other anemia-related problems.   In a study conducted by Ortho, the use of EPOsignificantly reduced the need for transfusions for patientswith AIDS who are treated with AZT, the anti-AIDS drugmarketed by Wellcome PLC. In the study of 118 patients, useof EPO reduced the need for transfusions by 40%, Ortho said.   &quot;We think this provides a real advance in the quality oflife for many people {with AIDS},&quot; said Mathilde Krim,founding co-chairwoman of the American Foundation for AIDSResearch. Ms. Krim said many doctors weren't using Amgen'sversion of EPO for AIDS patients because they were awaitingFDA approval.   Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp;Co., said he expected EPO sales to generate about $500million to $700 million in annual revenue for Johnson andamp;Johnson within five years.   Johnson andamp; Johnson already has been selling the drug inEurope, where it generated about $150 million in sales in1990.   Epogen and Procrit are &quot;the same drug,&quot; an Amgen spokesmansaid. Amgen's plant, which is next to company headquarters inThousand Oaks, Calif., will supply EPO to Johnson andamp; Johnsonfor packaging and sale to AIDS patients receiving AZT drugtreatment.   Amgen &quot;won't get into promoting {Epogen} outside thedialysis market, and we would expect Jandamp;J wouldn't getinvolved in the dialysis market,&quot; the spokesman said.   Under terms of their 1985 agreement, Amgen is entitled toroyalties from Procrit equal to 5% of sales until Johnson andamp;Johnson recovers certain development costs; then Amgen'spercentage will rise to 10%. Amgen said it already hasreceived about $25 million from Johnson andamp; Johnson to developEPO and two other drugs.   The agreement has been the subject of a bitter disputebetween the two companies. In April, a private arbitrationjudge ruled that Johnson andamp; Johnson must buy all of its U.S.supply of EPO from Amgen. The companies also are supposed todevelop a system that will enable them to monitor sales bymedical treatment. &quot;It's the only way to be sure that bothsides adhere to the agreement,&quot; the Amgen spokesman said.   Analysts said the financial impact of the FDA approval isminimal for Amgen. But said Linda Miller, an analyst atPaineWebber Inc., &quot;Many investors believe the market for EPOis much broader than dialysis, and this shows that the FDAagrees. EPO still isn't a mature product in terms of its lifecycle.&quot;   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Amgenshares rose $1.50 to $63.75. Johnson andamp; Johnson shares fell$1.75 to close at $70 in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading.</TEXT></DOC>
