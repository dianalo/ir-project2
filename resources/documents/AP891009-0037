Azerbaijani activist Shahin Gadzhiev said,``Our drivers arestriking and demanding guarantees of their safety,'' in response togunfire and stoning attacks on trains late Saturday in Armenia.   About 400 trains with a total of 60,000 cars have been reportedidled on main lines in the southwestern region. There wereconflicting reports over how much food, fuel and building suppliesmanaged to reach the Armenian republic.   The republics are feuding over Nagorno-Karabakh, a fertilepredominantly Armenian enclave that has been part ofMoslem-dominated Azerbaijan since 1923.   Ethnic feuding over the region in the past 19 months has left117 people dead, thousands injured and more than 2,000 homes andapartments destroyed, the official news agency Tass said Sunday.   On Tuesday, the Soviet legislature imposed a temporary ban onstrikes in key sectors such as transportation and energy. The movefollowed a warning from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev thatstoppages could ruin the economy and lead to anarchy.   Lawmakers also ordered security forces to restore rail trafficbetween the feuding Caucasus republics. Troops moved in to protectthe trains, and Soviet media said Friday that the two-monthblockade that crippled Armenia was over. Members of the AzerbaijaniPeople's Front denied that train traffic was halted Sunday.   ``The trains are running, but the attacks on them are alsocontinuing,'' Adel Mamedov said in an interview from theAzerbaijani capital of Baku.   But Tass reported late Sunday that 37 trains were dispatchedfrom Azerbaijan to Armenia over the past day and a half, and``extremist forces are still hindering the normal functioning ofthe route.''   In the Nagorno-Karabakh region, five people were wounded inclashes, Tass reported Sunday.   ``Mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict withdark malice and suppresses their reason,'' Tass said.   Airlifts ``are the only thing preventing mass starvation'' inNagorno-Karabakh, which has a predominantly Armenian population ofabout 160,000, Tass said.   Ungathered grape crops rot in the fields, there are armedattacks against villages, and ambulances don't have enoughgasoline, Tass said.   Meanwhile, a highway bridge on the outskirts ofNagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, was blown up earlySaturday, the agency said.   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said Sunday that Armenia stillfaced food and fuel shortages. He said the few shipments making itthrough to Armenia were sabotaged and contained either damagedmaterials or cisterns filled with water instead of fuel.   ``Everything that arrived is no good,'' he said in an interviewfrom the Armenian capital of Yerevan. ``That the blockade wasstopped at all is a myth.''   About 80 percent of Armenian rail traffic runs throughAzerbaijan.   The Azerbaijani blockade has virtually halted reconstructionwork on Armenian areas destroyed by a massive earthquake inDecember that left 25,000 dead.   Gadzhiev accused Armenians of plotting their own blockades onAzerbaijan.   He said Saturday's bridge explosion in Nagorno-Karabakh wasaimed at a nearby Azerbaijani village.   The power supply to part of Azerbaijan also has been interruptedby unrest in Nagorno-Karabakh, Gadzhiev said from the Azerbaijanicapital of Baku.</TEXT></DOC>
