AHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Parliamentary campaigning officiallybegan today, and the government set National Assembly elections forApril 26.   The Central Election Management Committee called for fair andorderly elections and warned against any illegal campaigning.   The elections will be the first time in 17 years that just onelawmaker is being elected from each district.   President Roh Tae-woo of the governing Democratic Justice Party,elected Dec. 16, is seeking a majority in the one-houselegislature. Division among opposition parties may give thegoverning party the edge.   Candidates immediately began to register with the committee.About 1,300 candidates were expected to register by the Wednesdaydeadline.   Some campaigning already has begun, with posters going up inmany places and politicians taking advantage of various gatheringsto attack the opposing side.   Under a new constitution that took effect Feb. 25 aimed atdemocratic reform, 224 lawmakers will be elected to four-year termsfrom single-member districts.   An additional 75 seats will be decided under a bonus systembased on the parties' nationwide polling strength.   In recent elections, two lawmakers were elected from eachdistrict, but that system has been scrapped in response to publiccriticism that voters' wishes were not truly represented when thefirst runners-up were elected too.   The governing party is hoping for a total of 163 seats in thedirect voting, giving it 55 percent of the 299 assembly seats.   In the presidential elections on Dec. 16, Roh won with just 36.6percent of the vote. Main opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and KimDae-jung received 55 percent of the vote, but split it between them.   The main opposition Reunification Democratic Party, controlledby Kim Young-sam, aims at 80 seats in the direct voting. Otheropposition groups, like Kim Dae-jung' Party for Peace andDemocracy, also have urged voters to give the opposition enoughassembly seats to allow it to effectively check the Rohadministration.   The two Kims and other opposition politicians charge that theRoh administration is an extension of the preceding government ofChun Doo-hwan, who left office Feb. 25 after a seven-year term.   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was arrested last weekon charges of embezzling more than $10 million, influence peddlingand tax evasion while heading Saemaul Undong (New CommunityMovement), a semi-official rural and urban development program. Thearrest was seen as a move by Roh to distance himself from Chun.   Kim Dae-jung has accused former President Chun of amassing afortune while in office and illegally taking huge sums of money outof the country to invest in foreign stock, land and other realestate in the United States and Australia.   The former president, now traveling in the United States, hasyet to respond to the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
