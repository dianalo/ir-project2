MangunoStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FRESTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In another move to dismantle the concept of &quot;Korea Inc.,&quot; the government has instructed South Korea's 82 most heavily indebted corporations to pay off 10% of their bank loans, or a total of about $1.2 billion, by year's end.    The Finance Ministry says the aggregate $12 billion debt of these companies has reached an unhealthy level, accounting for 20% of Korean banks' loans outstanding.    The ministry's instructions to the 82 concerns mark the latest effort by the government to improve the financial soundness of Korean companies, which are among the most highly leveraged in the world. Many of them have borrowed much more than they needed and have ended up with debts that far exceeded assets and equity. For many years, the government has been willing to allow companies to extend themselves in order to promote rapid growth. Now the government believes that the debts have become too high.    The government is struggling to put to rest the so-called Korea Inc. concept that has dominated lending and borrowing practices here for more than two decades. Lending to many Korean companies until recently has been based not on normal risk criteria, but on the understanding that if companies ran into financial trouble, the government would come to their assistance.    The foreign bank debt of troubled companies generally was absorbed by Korean domestic banks. The domestic banks, meanwhile, were allowed to pile up huge uncollectible loans on the understanding that the government wouldn't allow them to fail.    But by the mid-1980s, the level of nonperforming loans held by Korean banks had reached alarming proportions. At one point last year, the bad-loan total was unofficially estimated at $6 billion. Foreign bankers warned that South Korea's domestic bank and corporate debt problems resembled a house of cards that sooner or later was going to tumble.    The problem, bankers have repeatedly said, is that the financial records of many Korean companies are unsound, and without the guarantee of a government safety net, lending to them is beyond the acceptable risk limits of most foreign banks.    In recent months, bankers say, the realization that the notion of Korea Inc. is ending has caused many banks to be much more careful in scrutinizing the creditworthiness of Korean companies.    &quot;This could be the point of critical mass for Korea's private sector,&quot; says a U.S. banker. &quot;The companies, especially the big ones, will either have to get their financial structure and balance sheets in line with international standards, or it's going to be harder and harder for them to borrow.&quot;    In addition to notifying the 82 heavily indebted concerns, the Finance Ministry told the major creditor banks to expect early repayment of loans from the companies, which are among 144 Korean concerns that owe more than $60 million each in bank loans. The ministry says that companies that don't comply should be refused future bank loans and rescheduling of existing debts.    Nearly all the companies involved are affiliates of the country's biggest business groups. Thirteen are associated with the Samsung group, 10 with Hyundai, seven with Lucky-Goldstar, six with Daewoo, four with Sunkyong and four with Ssangyong. Eighteen other companies are linked to eight other conglomerates; the remaining 20 are companies aren't connected to major groups.    Eight of the companies that belong to the big groups, the ministry says, are in such poor financial shape that they probably won't be able to meet the government directive and will have to rely on other units within their groups for funding.    Of the $1.2 billion to be repaid, ministry officials say that $771.8 million is to be raised through increases in the paid-up capital of 50 major companies. An additional $339.7 million would come from convertible-bond issues on the domestic market by 22 companies. The remaining $88.5 million would be raised by seven companies that will go public by the end of this year, and three that already have offered their shares for subscription.    Ministry officials say they expect that if all 82 companies comply with the order, the average ratio of bank loans to net worth of the group would be lowered to 137% by the end of the year, from a current level of 174%.    They add that they also expect the order to help reduce inflationary pressures that have been building since the beginning of the year as a result of the country's huge trade surplus. At the end of last year, Korean inflation was running at 3%. Making the 82 companies raise their capital in order to retire the required 10% of debt, officials say, will soak up much of the excess money being held by the companies.    In addition, the ministry officials say, the money repaid to the banks would become available for credit to small and medium-sized businesses, which the government has been pushing to develop.    Last year, in the first major &quot;industrial-rationalization&quot; program, 56 financially troubled companies, mostly in the ailing shipping and overseas construction sectors, were liquidated or merged with healthy companies that assumed their debt.    Earlier this year, another batch of companies was likewise rationalized. When two construction companies failed in January, the government served unofficial notice that foreign banks should no longer expect special treatment in corporate collapses in Korea. </TEXT></DOC>
