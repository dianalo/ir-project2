On Tuesday, Communist Party authorities announced a plan to allowthe eight parties to participate in the government. Yan Mingfu, whoheads the Communist Party's office that deals with other parties,said the plan will be ready by June or July.   The parties will operate only under the leadership of theCommunist Party, which has ruled China since 1949, he said.   The plan comes as a growing number of intellectuals are callingfor more political freedom and appears to be an attempt by theCommunist Party to silence critics without relinquishing power.   Leaders of the eight parties said Thursday they expected moregovernment officials to be appointed from their ranks.   ``The Communist Party of China and the eight democratic partiesshare the same goals. We are in the same boat,'' Wan Guoquan, vicechairman of the China Democratic National Committee, said at a newsconference.   ``Just like a symphony, a country needs a conductor. TheCommunist Party is our conductor.''   The news conference was held by the Chinese People's PoliticalConsultative Conference, a prestigious but powerless advisory bodycurrently meeting in Beijing.   Members of the conference said new political parties are notneeded because the eight democratic parties represent a wide rangeof China's people.</TEXT></DOC>
