The ruling could prompt political fights or lawsuits in many of the 37 states with closed primaries, in which only registered members of a party may vote. But the ruling won't affect presidential primaries, because the Supreme Court already has recognized the authority of the Democratic and Republican parties to determine how delegates to their nominating conventions are chosen.    Yesterday's 5-4 decision, written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, involved a challenge by the Connecticut Republican Party to that state's primary-election law.    The Supreme Court said the Connecticut law interferes with the right of a political party and its members to associate with independent voters. That freedom of association is guaranteed by the First Amendment and can't be impeded by the state for what the court described as &quot;insubstantial&quot; reasons.    This right is extended solely to political parties and their members trying to broaden their bases. Objections to closed primaries must come from party leaders or members.    The Supreme Court previously has rejected independent voters' claims of a constitutional right to vote in party primaries. The court ruled in 1973 and 1976 that the rights of independents are overshadowed by the rights of political parties to govern their own affairs.    Although situations vary, political parties tend to favor an open primary when they are in the minority and want to woo independent voters. Parties sometimes oppose open primaries, however, in an effort to force independent voters to sign up with one party or the other.    In his opinion, Justice Marshall said Connecticut's arguments didn't justify infringing on constitutional rights. The state argued that permitting independents to vote in primaries would be too costly, would lead to one party &quot;raiding&quot; another's primary, would create voter confusion, and would undermine the two-party system.    Connecticut has had a closed primary since 1955, but it wasn't until 1983 that state Republicans decided they wanted the participation of independents. At the time, independents outnumbered Republicans and constituted almost a third of Connecticut's registered voters.    The state Republican Party decided to permit an open primary for Congress and all statewide offices except the state legislature. That raised another legal question because the Constitution says voter qualifications for congressional elections should be the same as for the larger of the two houses in the state legislature. However, Justice Marshall yesterday said the Constitution doesn't require &quot;perfect symmetry&quot; of eligible voters.    The high court's ruling upheld earlier decisions by a federal district court in New Haven, Conn., and a federal appeals court in New York.    Although it didn't decide the question, the Supreme Court strongly implied that a party doesn't have the right to insist that members of an opposing political party be allowed to vote in the primary. That would raise different issues, such as undermining the other party, the court said.    Yesterday's decision prompted the first dissenting opinion from the high court's newest member, Justice Antonin Scalia. Joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra O'Connor, he said the court &quot;exaggerates the importance of the associational interest at issue,&quot; which he called &quot;fanciful.&quot; Justice John Stevens also dissented.    Minor Parties   In another election-law ruling, the high court upheld a Washington state law that requires candidates of minor parties to receive at least 1% of the primary vote in order to qualify for a spot on the final state election ballot.    The ruling, by a 7-2 vote, was written by Justice Byron White. The court said states may require &quot;a showing of a modicum of support&quot; for access to the final ballot. The court said the Washington state requirement, which was challenged by the Socialist Workers Party, didn't impose &quot;too severe&quot; a requirement.    The high court reversed the ruling of a federal appeals court in San Francisco, which declared the Washington law unconstitutional.    Justice Marshall dissented, joined by Justice William Brennan. </TEXT></DOC>
