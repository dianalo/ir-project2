After hugging relatives, waving good-bye to a several dozenwell-wishers and gathering for a team photo, the six-member crewboarded the plane at 8:30 p.m.   The plane carrying 42 dogs and about 13,000 pounds of equipmentdeparted from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport one hourlater.   The grizzled Minnesota adventurer and five companions from fivecountries are probably as prepared as humans can be for thecontinent's perils.   ``I consider driving in Minneapolis rush-hour traffic much moredangerous than Antarctica,'' he said in an interview Friday. ``InAntarctica, things are in your control.''   After several stops in Latin America, their seven-month,4,000-mile trip across the bottom of the world was due to begin Aug.1, weather permitting. The team hopes the grueling journey from westto east will rivet attention on international cooperation, as wellas the continent's stark fragility.   At the same time, Steger, 44, wants to pursue a dream he says haslurked inside him for years: to conquer the world's last untamedfrontier.   ``I've traveled north for so many years now, and I've been drawnto these areas,'' said Steger. ``It's the frontier, it's the whitespots on the maps, the adventure and the exhilaration of travelingin those unknown places that draws me.''   Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snowtractors, but this will be the first unmechanized attempt.   The venture has also drawn lots of publicity and money, withcorporations in the United States and France contributing nearly $10million. A $3.5 million aluminum boat will serve as a floatingembassy and communications base.   The team has been plucked from all corners of the earth through acombination of nationalities and outdoor skills. The members areSteger, co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of France, Soviet scientistVictor Boyarsky, Englishman Geoff Somers, Keizo Funatsu of Japan,and Qin Dahe of China.   The trip south is to includes stops in Havana; Lima, Peru; andBuenos Aires, Argentina.   Finally, from the tiny Argentine city of Rio Grande, the crewwill wait for the proper weather to fly to King George Island nearthe tip of the Antarctic peninsula, where the Chinese will behosting the trek's launch at the Great Wall research base. Thearbitrary point of Seal Nunataks was chosen as the trek's launchingpad.   But even the best plans can't completely shield the crew fromAntarctica's temperatures _ hovering at 50 degrees below zero _ orits blinding winds that reach gusts of 100 mph.   ``The challenge is going to be the constant wind that may blow 10to 15 miles an hour against you in your face, and the storms thatliterally rip apart your tent,'' Steger said.   The hazards don't stop there. Crevasses up to 150 feet deep awaitthe crew, avoidable only by painstaking attention to dips in thesnow or changes in color that signal light coming through.   While money and letters from well-wishers have poured in, theexpedition has also drawn its share of criticism.   Jack Talmadge, head of polar coordination and information at theNational Science Foundation, worries that Steger's well-publicizedefforts on the continent would bring in more people.   ``We think the expression by Will Steger of a basic human need toexplore is admirable,'' he said. But if tourism to the Antarcticdeveloped further, he said, wildlife could be disrupted.   Such concerns are pointless, said expedition spokeswoman JenniferGasperini. ``We're not trying to promote tourism. ... We need togenerate an awareness of Antarctica, to make people understand thepristine nature of its environment and therefore preserve it.''   This won't be Steger's final expedition, but it will be the lastof its magnitude, the adventurer said.   ``It will be a pinnacle of major Arctic expeditions. There'sreally nowhere you can go to top this one.''</TEXT></DOC>
