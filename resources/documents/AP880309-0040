(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis andVice President George Bush built vigorous campaigns on alreadystrong personal ties to score resounding victories in RhodeIsland's presidential primaries.   ``Our mission has been accomplished,'' said Gov. Edward D.DiPrete, who repaid Bush's campaign journeys to the state withstrong backing. ``There is really a Bush blastout tonight all overthe country.''   Bush, a New England native, swept his chief rival, Kansas Sen.Bob Dole, in 16 states around the country in the Super Tuesdayprimaries.   In the Democratic race, with 100 percent of 320 precinctsreporting, Dukakis amassed 34,159 votes or 70 percent, making hisvictory even bigger than that of another Bay Stater, Sen. EdwardKennedy, in the 1980 primary.   Jesse Jackson was a distant second with 7,369 votes or 15percent, followed by Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt with 2,013votes or 4 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. with 1,932 votesor 4 percent; Illinois Sen. Paul Simon with 1,392 votes or 3percent and Gary Hart with 738 votes or 2 percent.   Among Republicans, with 319 of 320 precincts or 99 percentreporting, Bush won 10,403 votes or 65 percent, trailed by Dolewith 3,637 votes or 23 percent; Pat Robertson with 921 votes or 6percent and Rep. Jack Kemp, 783 votes or 5 percent.   Based on those results, Bush would likely capture 15 GOPdelegates and Dole would win six, while Dukakis would gain 19Democratic delegates and Jackson three.   Dukakis, as the governor of a neighboring state, was a familiarface to Rhode Islanders long before he began running for president.He campaigned here several times and quickly picked up support frommost of Rhode Island's Democratic hierarchy.   Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr., state chairman of theDukakis campaign, said the governor's win was even more impressivethan Kennedy's victory over President Carter in the 1980 Democraticprimary.   Kennedy ``had about 65 to 67 percent of the vote in a two-manrace,'' Paolino said. ``This is a five-man race.''   Jackson supporters broke out champagne to celebrate theircandidate's strong showing in a state that is only 2 percent black.</TEXT></DOC>
