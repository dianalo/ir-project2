Both surface and bulk phonons are coupled to the moleculevia perturbation theory. The reduced density matrix of the molecule iswritten in terms of three wave-function-like objects, which obey Schrodinger-likeequations of motion. These highly coupled equations of motion are evolvedsimultaneously in time, using standard techniques. The method can beapplied to any of several recent quantum and semiclassical time dependentscattering theories, and allows one to compute the thermally averagedproperties of the system at all times. The total computational effortis only about three times that of the zero temperature calculation. Resultsare presented for the inelastic scattering of He and Ne beams from Cu(111),Cu(100), and Ni(111).</TEXT></DOC>
