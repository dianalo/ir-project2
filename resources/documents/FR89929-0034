L.100-562), provides that motor vehicles not originally manufactured to conformto Federal motor vehicle safety standards may nevertheless be importedinto the United States under certain circumstances. In general, such avehicle may be imported under bond for certification of its conformance,or exportation in the event it is not conformed, by those who have registeredwith NHTSA as importers, provided that NHTSA has determined that the nonconformingvehicle is capable of being conformed to meet the safety standards.The Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to establish fees to cover its cost ofadministering the registration program, and of making conformance capabilitydeterminations, and to reimburse the U.S. Customs Service its costs inprocessing the importation bond. The purpose of this rule is to adopt thefee schedules that will implement the statutory authorization. The agencyhas concluded that the initial annual fee for the registration programis $255. The fee to accompany a petition for a determination that a vehicleis eligible for importation is either $1560 or $2150, depending upon thebasis of the petition. These fees are identical to those proposed. Thefee required to reimburse the U.S. Customs Service for bond processingcosts is $4.35 per bond.

The effective date of theamendments is January 31, 1990. On and after that date, with the exceptionsspecified in the notice, motor vehicles that have not been originally manufacturedto conform to the Federal motor vehicle safety standards may be importedonly by persons who have registered with NHTSA as undertaking to bringthe vehicle into conformance, or by persons who have contracts with registeredimporters to perform conformance work. In addition, such a vehicle maynot be imported unless NHTSA has determined that it is capable of beingconformed to the standards. The agency may make such a determination ina response to a petition by a registered importer, or on its own initiative.Each vehicle permitted entry must be accompanied by a bond given to secureperformance of the conformance work, or, to ensure its exportation or abandonmentto the United States in the event that the vehicle is not brought intofull conformance.Rules have been issued to implement the other provisions of the VehicleSafety Act described above, and are being published simultaneously withthis notice. They are 49 CFR part 591, <T3>Importation of Vehicles and Equipment Subject to Federal Motor VehicleSafety Standards; </T3>part 592, <T3>Registered Importers of Vehicles not Originally Manufactured To Conformto the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; </T3>and part 593, <T3>Determinations That a Vehicle not Originally Manufactured To Conformto the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Is Eligible for Importation.</T3>A proposed schedule of fees (part 594) was published on April 25,1989 (54 FR 17792).The new provisions also specifically authorize NHTSA to impose fees tocover certain administrative costs incurred in implementation of the newimportation procedures. There are two or more types of fees to cover threetypes of costs for which fees may be charged: an annual fee to cover thecosts of administration of the importer registration program, an annualfee or fees to cover the costs of processing the bond furnished to theCustoms Service, and an annual fee or fees to cover the costs of makingimport eligibility determinations.The purpose of this rule is to adopt a fee schedule that appears appropriatefor recovery of each cost, and to explain the rationale behind each ofthese fees. In identifying those agency activities that may form the costbasis of a fee authorized by the new import provisions, the agency hasconsidered the experience of other agencies in establishing users feesunder the Independent Offices Authorization Act (31 U.S.C. 9701), and theConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (Pub.L. 99-272). Thus, asproposed, and as repeated in this notice, the agency will: identify eachservice it provides, explain why it is entitled to recover the cost ofproviding that service, identify each type of expenditure incurred in providingthat service, explain the criteria used to include or exclude a particularexpenditure, and calculate the amount of each such expenditure.There were three substantive responses to the proposal, submitted by AuburnMotors, Inc., The Dealer Action Association, and Mercedes-Benz of NorthAmerica.<ITAG tagnum="84">1. Requirements of the Fee Regulation</ITAG>Section 594.6 Annual Fee for administration of the importer registrationprogramSection 108(c)(3)(A)(iii) of the Vehicle Safety Act provides that registeredimporters must pay ``such annual fee as the Secretary establishes to coverthe cost of administering the registration program. . . .''The first issue addressed by the agency in its proposal was whether theterm ``registration program'' is inclusive of all activities under section108(c) (except for the other activities for which a fee may be imposed),or whether it is restricted to activities relating directly to the registrationprocess, such as reviewing registration applications and acting upon them.The agency interpreted ``registration program'' conservatively, and concludedthat it refers only to activities connected with the development and maintenanceof the registration process, including monitoring, and enforcement activitiesresulting in suspension or revocation of a registration. Although it couldbe argued that NHTSA's verification of the certification submitted by aregistered importer is relevant to the maintenance by that registered importerof its status, this agency believes that Congress did not intend to includesuch an activity in the registration program. Specifically, section 108(c)(3)(B)(i)prohibits the application of fees collected under the Vehicle Safety Actto NHTSA's inspection of vehicles for which certifications have been filed.Thus, NHTSA proposed to exclude, from the fee structure of the registrationprogram, activities connected with processing of certificates and compliancedocumentation of motor vehicles.Mercedes-Benz and The Dealer Action Association disagreed with NHTSA'sconclusions, and argued that all costs except those specifically exemptedin the statute ought to be included. Each believes that the costs associatedwith processing certificates of conformity and monitoring compliance shouldalso be included. They argued that Congress intended that the costs beborne in full by those who would benefit from the new legislation, andthat the presence of specific exclusions in the legislation argues foran inclusive approach. Specifically, the commenters believe that two separateprovisions must be read together to understand the scope of the fee structureCongress meant to establish. Section 108(c)(3)(A)(iii) requires collectionfrom each Registered Importer of its pro rata share of administering theregistration program. Section 108(c)(3)(B) then defines the scope of agencyactivities covered. It states in relevant part ``All fees collected shallbe available until expended * * * solely for use * * * in the administrationof all of the requirements of this subsection * * *'', other than NHTSA'speriodic inspection of motor vehicles for which certificates have beenfurnished, and regulations governing the Registered Importer's financialability to notify and remedy.The commenters further argue that the legislative history also evidencesCongressional intent to establish comprehensive fees. Remarks by SenatorInouye are cited in support:<ITAG tagnum="21">This new program will be financed through fees paid by registeredimporters upon registration, and annually thereafter, as calculated bythe Secretary to cover the additional costs of administering the program.We felt it was appropriate in this limited instance to require the paymentof such fees because this new program is being established solely for thebenefit of registered importers and will continue to permit them to stayin business.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Cong. Rec. S14734, daily ed. October 5, 1988.</ITAG>The commenters believe that NHTSA should recalculate the costs it willincur and make appropriate adjustments in the fees it will require RegisteredImporters to pay annually. The agency has carefully considered these comments. NHTSA notes the commentby Senator Rudman (S14375) that the fees cover the costs of administeringonly ``certain provisions'', and that ``the user fees would not apply tothe testing of these vehicles. . . . This is a responsibility normallyassumed by the Department.'' NHTSA believes that it was not the intentof Congress to assess fees for activities that represent ``a responsibilitynormally assumed by the Department'', <T3>i.e., </T3>a responsibility that was part of the agency's enforcementprogram before enactment of the 1988 Act. The registration requirements(section 108(c)(3)(D)) constitute an entirely new program, but the requirementsfor submission and evaluation of certification and documentation (section108(c)(3)(E)) have a direct counterpart in the agency's present enforcementprogram under which a statement of conformance supplemented by documentaryevidence must be provided before action is taken upon the bond. Thereforethe agency has not broadened its interpretation of the elements of theregistration program in section 108(c)(3)(D) to cover activities in section108(c)(3)(E).The second issue addressed by NHTSA, and relevant to the other authorizedfees as well, was whether the agency can recover both direct and indirectcosts associated with its activities. It noted that there is no modifierof the word ``costs'', and concluded that both direct and indirect costsmay be recovered. Such costs include all costs of administering the program,including salaries and other personnel costs (retirement, insurance andleave), travel, postage, maintenance and depreciation of equipment, supplies,and a proportionate share of agency management and supervisory costs aswell as accrued liabilities, which include severance pay, unemploymentcompensation, workers compensation, and unused leave costs. The commentersdid not address this issue. The initial annual fee attributable to the registration program containsthree components. The first component is one that would cover the costof processing an application by a person seeking to become a registeredimporter. It would not be refundable in the event of a denial. The secondcomponent represents the costs attributable to such inspection of an applicant'sfacilities as the agency may deem necessary to conduct prior to a decisionon an application. The third component is intended to cover the remainingcosts. The first and third components of the initial annual fee will bepaid at the time that an applicant seeks to become a registered importer.The second component will be paid only if an inspection is actually conducted,and would be payable by the end of the tenth calendar day after notificationby the agency. If the application is denied, the amount of the fee representingthe third component will be refunded to the applicant. Annual fees after the initial annual fee will also have three components.Instead of a component attributable to processing an application, the firstcomponent of a regular annual fee will cover the costs of processing theregistered importer's annual statement (or mid-year changes) attestingthat there is no material change in its condition and that it is maintainingits financial and technical ability to meet its statutory obligations.The second component will cover the cost, if any, of such inspections theagency might have conducted with respect to the registered importer duringthe year. The third component is again intended to cover remaining costs.With respect to the first component of the initial annual fee, the relativelysimple, discrete activities involved in processing and acting upon registrationapplications permit a uniform first component sum to be developed, payableby all who seek to become registered importers. Similarly, the agency tasksinvolved in processing and reviewing annual statements appear to permita uniform first component sum to be developed. The direct costs that theagency will consider in this regard are the amount of time spent in reviewingapplications or annual statements for form and content, analysis, and draftingof documents relating to the analysis and disposition of the applicationor annual statement, including direct supervisory time. Other direct costsassociated, such as postage, computer time, and meetings to discuss themerits of an application or annual statement, will be included in the feestructure. However, while the application is pending, NHTSA may wish toinspect the premises of the applicant. The costs of this inspection wouldform the basis of the second component of the fee that must be paid beforea determination is made on the merits of the application. Inspections conductedafter registration (the second component of the regular annual fee) wouldbe reflected in the next annual fee payable by the registered importerconcerned. The agency will include indirect costs as well. For example, if one-thirdof a staffer's time at a word processing terminal is spent in draftingdocuments relative to an application determination, then a third of thecost of maintaining the space and the terminal will be factored into aregistration fee. Indirect general and administrative costs can be includedin the fee structure as a pro rata share of the costs attributable to runningthe program. Once a registration has been granted, section 108(d)(2) imposes an obligationon a registered importer to maintain evidence satisfactory to NHTSA thatit continues to be financially able to meet its statutory responsibilities``relating to discovery, notification, and remedy of motor vehicle defects.''Further, section 108(c)(3)(D)(ii) directs the agency to set requirementsfor registered importers, including at a minimum (1) requirements for record-keeping;and (2) requirements for records and facilities inspection for registeredimporters. Activities of the agency associated with satisfying it of financialability and meeting other specified responsibilities may be included inthe cost basis of the registration program annual fee. The initial annualfee adopted by this notice is based upon NHTSA's estimates of costs forthe first fiscal year that the registration program is in effect. If theamount of the annual fee for a succeeding year is adjusted, the adjustmentwill take into account NHTSA's actual experience in the year preceding.Under andSection; 592.6(a)(7) of the regulation on Registered Importers,the agency may inspect a facility or the records which the Registered Importermust keep to fulfill its program responsibilities. There are two purposesfor which such inspections may be conducted. The first is to verify thatthe regulatory criteria for obtaining or maintaining the status of registeredimporter are met. These inspections are directly related to administrationof the registration program. The agency will include direct and indirectcosts associated with these inspection activities in the fee structurefor the program. The second purpose for which an inspection may be conductedis to verify that a certification filed by a registered importer is supportedby the conformance work performed. This activity is specifically excludedas a cost towards which fees may not be applied. Consequently, if inspectinga facility for compliance with registration requirements also involvesvehicle inspection, agency staff will segregate costs to exclude thoseattributable to the inspection of vehicles. Only those costs directly attributableto the registration program will be included in the second component ofthe next regular annual fee. As with the costs of processing an initial application or annual statement,all direct and indirect costs associated with the suspension and reinstatementof Registered Importer status are recoverable by the agency. These includecosts associated with notifying a registrant that the agency is consideringsuspension, plus the costs of allowing it to present its opposition tosuspension under andSection; 592.7(b) of the Registered Importer regulation,and costs associated with processing a registrant's request that NHTSAreconsider a suspension under andSection; 592.7(e). The final associatedcost is that of notifying the registrant of the determination regardingits suspension. Similarly, the costs associated with revoking a registration are recoverable.These include notifying a Registered Importer in writing that NHTSA intendsto revoke registration under andSection;592.7(b), or that the agency hasrevoked a registration under andSection;592.7(c) because the registrant knowinglyfiled a false or misleading certification. Further recoverable costs arethose associated with reviewing, analyzing and responding to the registrant'swritten opposition to a preliminary decision to revoke its registration.The agency will include whatever activities are associated with makinga determination under andSection;592.7(d) that the basis for a suspensionno longer exists. The nature of the reinstatement process will vary dependingon the reason for the suspension. For example, the process will be comparativelysimple if the suspension was for failure to pay a fee. Section 594.7 Fee for Vehicle Importation Eligibility Petitions Section 108(c)(3)(A)(iii)(II) also requires Registered Importers to pay``such other annual fee or fees as the Secretary reasonably establishesto cover the cost of * * * making the determinations under this section.''Pursuant to part 593, these determinations are whether the vehicle soughtto be imported is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufacturedfor importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as meetingthe Federal standards, and whether it is capable of being readily modifiedto meet those standards, or, alternatively, where there is no substantiallysimilar U.S. motor vehicle, whether the safety features of the vehiclecomply with or are capable of being modified to comply with the U.S. standards.These determinations are made pursuant to petitions submitted by RegisteredImporters or manufacturers, or pursuant to determinations made upon theAdministrator's initiative. In developing this regulation, the agency considered the type and frequencyof fees that would best implement the purpose of the 1988 Act. With respectto making eligibility determinations, it considered an ``annual fee'',in which total costs attributable to eligibility determinations would bedivided equally among all Registered Importers. Such a fee would be payableat the time of the next regular annual fee for administration of the registrationprogram. This type of fee appeared equitable in the sense that more thanone Registered Importer may benefit from an eligibility determination,and that the costs would not be borne by the petitioner alone. However,NHTSA proposed and adopted a requirement that a fee be charged for individualpetitions for determinations of eligibility. The benefit of this approachis that it permits ``pay-as-you-go'', under which costs are more quicklyrecovered. This fee would be payable by a petitioner for a determination,or by the importer who first benefits from a determination made on theagency's initiative (see further discussion below). The agency requested comments on each approach, but it proposed the secondapproach. Under this, a petition by a manufacturer or Registered Importerfor a determination would be accompanied by the fee specified in andSection;594.7.The payment of this fee by the petitioner is premised upon the likelihoodthat the petitioner would be the immediate beneficiary of any favorabledetermination, and therefore, ought to pay the costs authorized by statutefor consideration of its petition. The immediate beneficiary of a favorabledetermination made upon the Administrator's initiative would be the firstRegistered Importer, or other person, who imports a vehicle that is coveredby the determination. Therefore, NHTSA proposed to establish a fee thatwould be payable by the Registered Importer who furnishes a certificateof conformity covering the first vehicle imported under a declaration filedafter notice of the Administrator's initiative determination has appearedin the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The notice would include a discussion of thefee to be paid and the basis for it. Subsequently, upon receipt of thefirst declaration covering the vehicle, NHTSA would notify the RegisteredImporter concerned that the stated fee is due at the time the certificateof conformity covering the vehicle is received. However, NHTSA is awarethat such costs would remain unrecoverable until such time as (and unless)a declaration is filed on such a vehicle. The three commenters on the proposal recommended that it would be moreequitable to divide the petition fee among all Registered Importers. NHTSAgave close attention to these comments and examined various ways that thiscould be accomplished. Because of the requirement of section 108(c)(3)(B)that the fee applicable in any fiscal year be established before the beginningof such year, NHTSA concluded that it could not implement the suggestionit had discussed in the proposal, to establish a pro rata fee applicableto all Registered Importers at the end of a fiscal year to cover all petitiondeterminations of that year. Collection of such a sum appeared difficultalso; the agency did not appear to have leverage over manufacturers whohad filed petitions without a fee, and as for Registered Importers, todefer renewal of registration until the annual petition fee was paid seemedirrelevant to maintenance of the qualifications of Registered Importers.The agency concluded that payment by the petitioner at the time of thepetition represented the most effective way to recover the costs of eligibilitydeterminations, but within that framework it explored ways of equalizingthe burden by an allocation at the end of the fiscal year. As an alternativeto dividing total petition fees by the number of Registered Importers,the fee for a petition for a specific make/model could be divided by thenumber of only those Registered Importers who had furnished certificatesof conformity for that make/model during the year. A variation of thisalternative would be a formula with weights given Registered Importersaccording to the specific number of that specific make/model each had imported.At the end of the fiscal year, there would be a reconciliation of sums,under which certain Registered Importers could be given cash refunds orcredits toward future petitions, or, if the reconciliation showed otherwise,an assessment imposed on a Registered Importer. No approach appeared tobe without problems, and each, other than payment at the time of the petition,would add costs to the general fee structure. Nevertheless, NHTSA remainsinterested in the concept of equalizing the burden, and on the basis ofits experience in the first year of the petition program, will consideradditional ways that this might be accomplished. It would be interestedin having constructive comments during this period. As NHTSA observed in the notice, the activities that may form the costbasis for petitions appear to include logging-in, notifying the petitionerof receipt, and evaluating the petition. If the agency grants a writtenrequest by the petitioner to appear to discuss a petition under andSection;593.7(c),it will recover the cost of processing the written request and discussingthe petition. Although the 1988 Act does not require an actual demonstrationof conformance, only that a vehicle is capable of conformance, a petitionermay wish to substantiate its arguments with presentation of a modifiedvehicle. In that event, it may be necessary for NHTSA to inspect the modifiedvehicle as part of its role in determining whether the vehicle is eligiblefor importation. The cost of that inspection would be properly recoverable.The new import provisions require publication of a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>; thus the agency will also recover costs associatedwith preparing and processing <T4>Federal Register </T4>documents generated in connection with the petition,processing and analyzing comments submitted in connection with a <T4>Federal Register </T4>document; and notifying a petitioner of the agency'sdecision. When NHTSA makes a determination on its own initiative, it will also publisha notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and receive and evaluate comments on it. The new import provisions do not require the agency to publish a second<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice immediately after a decision is made.Section 108(c)(3)(C)(iv), however, does require NHTSA to publish annuallyin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a list of all vehicles determined to be eligiblefor import under the Act. Compiling and publishing this list is connectedwith making and announcing eligibility determinations, and the costs willbe included in the fee structure.Section 594.8 Fee payable for Administrator's determinationCosts to be recovered through payment of a fee also cover those attributableto determinations of import eligibility made on NHTSA's initiative. Theprincipal issue here is how such costs are to be recovered in the absenceof a petitioner. The method proposed was that it be paid by the first RegisteredImporter who furnishes a certificate of conformity covering such vehicleafter NHTSA's determination on its own initiative. There were no specificcomments on this method, though it was clearly implied by the three commentersthat such costs should be shared equally by all Registered Importers. Forthe reasons set forth above in the discussion on allocation of fees amongRegistered Importers, it is impracticable to do so, and NHTSA has adoptedthe method proposed.Section 594.9 Fee to Recover the Costs of Processing the BondSection 108(c)(3)(A)(iii)(II) also requires a registered importer to pay``such annual fee or fees as the Secretary reasonably establishes to coverthe cost of processing the bond furnished to the Secretary of the Treasury''upon the importation of a nonconforming vehicle to ensure that the vehiclewill be brought into compliance within a reasonable time, or if the vehicleis not brought into compliance within such time, that it is exported withoutcost to the United States, or abandoned to the United States.The statute contemplates that NHTSA make a reasonable determination ofthe cost to the United States Customs Service of processing the bond. Theagency has met with representatives of the Customs Service to obtain suchinformation as would allow it to include the cost basis of processing thebond in the fee structure. The analysis that Customs has provided NHTSAindicates that it has followed the same guidelines as the agency does todetermine whether each activity associated with processing the bond givesrise to a recoverable cost. The 1988 Act requires the bond to be furnishedthe Secretary of the Treasury acting on behalf of NHTSA. However, NHTSAhas decided, and Customs concurs, that the bond in question is not thegeneral importation bond which covers duties and other obligations relevantto merchandise. It is a bond given to secure performance of obligationsunder the Vehicle Safety Act, and will therefore be a bond of the Departmentof Transportation and not of the Treasury. The two Federal agencies havedetermined that this bond will accompany the declaration at the time ofentry, and be submitted with it to NHTSA. Thus the role of Customs in ``processing''the bond will be limited to two activities. At the time of importation,it will ensure that the bond is attached to the entry form (or reject theentry for lack of the bond). After bond verification, it will forward thebond and entry form to NHTSA. A third activity will be required in theevent that a vehicle must be exported for failing to meet NHTSA's requirements:the supervision of export.The first two activities will form the basis for the processing cost payableby the registered importer. The cost of the third activity will be partof the bond, so that if the vehicle must be redelivered for export, a sumcovering the third activity would be payable to NHTSA on behalf of Customs.Although NHTSA will advance Customs its costs in accordance with statutoryrequirements, it will recover these costs on an <T3>ad hoc</T3> basis, requiring a registered importer to submit a bondprocessing fee at the time it submits conformance verification on eachvehicle.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Calculations of the agency's costs in setting fees</ITAG>To the extent possible, the agency's costs in setting fees are based uponan accounting of each discrete activity involved in the process. Thus,the fees imposed by part 594 include the agency's best direct and indirectcost estimates of the man-hours involved in each activity, on both thestaff and supervisory levels, the costs of computer and word processorusage, postage costs, costs attributable to travel, salary and benefits,and maintenance of work space, to name the ones set forth in the proposedregulation.Specifically, each fee is calculated on the basis of the direct and indirectcosts associated with the activity for which the fee is paid. The directcosts include the average cost per professional staff-hour, computer andword processor time, stationery and postage, and transportation.The average cost per professional staff-hour is calculated based upon thefull costs for time spent (to the nearest quarter-hour) using the followingapplicable professional staff rates:(A) Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance_<ITAG tagnum="16">Clerical staff_$13 per hour.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> Computer contract staff_$25 per hour.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Review staff_$26 per hour.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Supervisors_$41 per hour.</ITAG>(B) Office of Chief Counsel_$41 per hour.The average cost per computer-hour is calculated at the rate of $100 perhour.The average cost for postage is calculated to be $3.00.The indirect costs include a pro rata allocation of the average salaryand benefits of persons employed in processing the applications and recommendingdecisions on them, and a pro rata allocation of the costs attributableto maintaining the office space, and the computer or word processor. Thestaff rates above include benefits; the costs associated with office space,equipment maintenance, communications and other overhead amount to an additional$6.71 per hour.The cost for determining the salary and benefits of persons employed iscalculated based upon the time spent multiplied by the employee's hourlywage.The cost of maintaining the computer or word processor is calculated basedupon maintenance, time sharing, and staff operations.The cost of maintaining the office space is calculated based upon standardgovernment regulations based upon grade levels.The cost of travel is based upon an estimated round trip air fare of $250,and a 3-day per diem of $100 a day, for a total trip cost of $550.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Registration Program Fee</ITAG> The Registration Program Annual Fee has two and in some instances threecomponents: a portion attributable to the registration process, a portionattributable to any inspection of an applicant that the agency deems neededto verify information submitted in an application for registration, anda portion attributable to other activities occurring in the registrationprogram. Exclusive of the inspection portion, the agency has decided thatthe initial Annual Registration Program fee shall be $255.The initial component of the Registration Program Fee is the portion ofthe fee attributable to processing and acting upon registration applications.The agency estimates this portion of the fee as $85.99.In calculating the direct costs of processing registration applications,NHTSA estimates that one staff member and one supervisor will spend a totalof one man-hour in processing, reviewing, and acting upon applications,that a quarter hour of computer, and computer-operator time will be requiredto verify that the applicant has not had a registration revoked, that ahalf-hour of clerical time will be required, and that postal charges willbe incurred. These costs are estimated at $74.25.In calculating the indirect costs of processing registration applications,NHTSA has estimated that these will average $6.71 per hour spent. Processingwill require a total of 1.75 hours per application, thus NHTSA estimatesthat indirect costs will total $11.74. Thus the total direct and indirectcosts of this component are $85.99.With respect to other costs attributable to maintenance of the registrationprogram, these consist principally of reviewing a registrant's annual statementverifying the continuing validity of information already submitted, andprocessing annual fees. These costs also include costs attributable torevocation or suspension of a registration.In calculating the direct costs of administering the registration programother than costs connected with the initial application, NHTSA estimatesthat one staff member and one supervisor will spend a total of 1.5 man-hoursin administration activities, that one-half hour of computer time, andcomputer operator time will be required, that 1.5 hours of clerical andrecordkeeping time will be needed, and a postal charge will be incurred.The total direct charges for administering the registration program areestimated at $131.50. The total overhead costs of the 3.5 hours involvedare $23.49, or a total of $154.99. These costs, of course, are exclusiveof costs associated with revocation or suspension.At this point, it appears fairest that a suspended registrant bear thecosts associated with suspension and reinstatement, to be included in itsnext annual fee. However, it will not be feasible to recover costs froman importer whose registration has been revoked. Those costs appear bestborne by each registered importer paying a pro rata share in its annualfee. Obviously, before the effective date of the 1988 Act, NHTSA has noknowledge of how many registered importers there will be or how many suspensionsor revocations may occur in the first year of the program. However, forpurposes of determining this portion of the registration fee, NHTSA estimatesthere will be 20 registered importers during the fiscal year beginningOctober 1, 1989, and ending September 30, 1990, and that there will beone revocation. Under Part 592, the procedures that the agency will followin determining whether a registration should be revoked or suspended areidentical. This means that the direct and indirect costs should also beidentical, up to the point of an agency determination. Because a suspendedregistration may be reinstated, either upon expiration of the term statedin the agency's letter of suspension, or upon cure of the cause givingrise to the suspension, there will be a slight additional cost commensuratewith the clerical aspects of ending the suspension.NHTSA contemplates that its Enforcement Office will recommend suspensionsor revocations to the Office of Chief Counsel, and that 1 hour of stafftime, and .25 hour computer operator time will be involved in recommendations.In addition, .25 hour of computer time will be used. The Office of ChiefCounsel will require 1.75 hours to review the recommendation and drafta letter to the registrant, and an additional 1.75 hours to review theregistrant's reply and to draft a letter of suspension, or revocation,or declining to take further action. Postal charges will total $6.00. Thetotal direct costs associated with this procedure are $206.75, and theoverhead costs for 4.75 hours of agency time, $34.87. The sum of $238.62divided by the 20 estimated Registered Importers gives a figure of $11.93to be added to the portion of the annual fee representing maintenance ofthe registration program (For reinstatement, to be borne by the registrant,NHTSA estimates that the total direct and indirect costs will be $40.36,representing .25 hour of clerical time, .25 hour of computer time, and.25 hour of computer operator time).Thus, the total portion attributable to maintenance of the registrationprogram, as estimated by NHTSA, is approximately $166.92. When added tothe $85.99 representing the registration application component, the costper applicant equals $252.91. Therefore, NHTSA has determined that theinitial annual registration fee, for the period October 1, 1989 throughSeptember 30, 1990, is $255. In the event that an application is deniedor withdrawn, NHTSA will refund all but $86 of this amount, or $169.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Fee for Vehicle Eligibility Petitions</ITAG>In calculating the direct costs of processing and acting upon a petitionfor a determination of eligibility, NHTSA estimates that the costs involvedfor determinations involving substantially similar vehicles will requiresubstantially less agency time than those for non-similar vehicles. Forpurposes of this determination, NHTSA has chosen passenger cars and multipurposepassenger vehicles, the most frequently imported types of motor vehicles.The agency estimates the total direct and indirect costs for a determinationinvolving a substantially similar vehicle at $1558.68, and for a non-similarvehicle at $2151.61. In this light, a fee of $1560 for substantially similarvehicle determinations, and one of $2150 for those that are not substantiallysimilar, appears to fulfill the statutory directive. More specifically, the following cost breakdown has been estimated forsubstantially similar (and non-similar) vehicles. The process will resultin personnel costs related to 2 (5) supervisory hours, 24 (35) staff hours,.25 (.25) hour computer time, .25 (2) hour(s) data entry time, .50 (2)hour(s) clerical time, and .25 (.50) hour recordkeeping time. In addition,.25 hour of computer time would be used for each. However, costs associatedwith preparing and publishing the two Federal Register notices, and evaluatingcomments to the first notice, should be identical. Each notice may requiretwo columns of space ($125 per column), for a cost of $250 per notice,and total publication costs of $500. Following agency practice with otherpetitions, the notices will be prepared by the Office of Chief Counsel.It is estimated that each notice will require 1 hour of preparation time,and .50 hour of clerical time, or a total of 3 hours for both notices.The estimated total direct charges for determinations of eligibility willbe $1342 ($1817.50). In calculating the indirect costs of processing andacting upon eligibility petitions, NHTSA estimates that the process, includingthe Federal Register preparation time, will take 30 (47.50) man hours,for a cost of $201.30 ($318.73), or a total cost of $1543.30 ($2136.23).These totals include .25 hour of computer time. To this must be added thepro rata cost of the yearly Federal Register school. It is estimated thatthis will require 1 hour of Office of Chief Counsel time, .50 hour clericaltime, and two columns in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The total direct costs to fulfill this statutoryrequirement would be $297.50. The overhead costs, $10.07. The total of$307.56 divided among the estimated 20 registered importers adds $15.38to each petition cost, or a total of $1558.68 ($2151.61). Therefore, apetition fee of $1560 ($2150) is being adopted. At this point, costs appearsimilar for those determinations made upon the agency's own initiative,and the same fee will be used in recovery of costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Bond Processing Costs</ITAG>With respect to the costs attributable to processing the bond furnishedthe Secretary of the Treasury, the agency estimated and proposed $125 perbond. However, after the proposal, NHTSA determined that the role of Customsin ``processing'' the bond under the 1988 Act would be limited to ensuringthat the bond was completed and attached to the entry form, and that bothwould be forwarded to NHTSA. Customs then provided NHTSA with a detailedestimate of the costs involved in its processing of the bond. These taskswould be performed by a GS 9 Step 5 employee (hourly rate $12.94). Eighteenminutes would be required to verify the content of the bond information,amount, and completeness, and to enter the information into Customs' dataprocessing system. These tasks would cover all nonconforming vehicles imported.It is Customs practice to conduct verification inspections on approximately15% of vehicles, verifying VINs to bonds, and this inspection would occupy13 minutes. Finally, Customs estimates that 1% of the vehicles enteredwould not be brought into satisfactory conformity, requiring fulfillmentof the bond condition of export. The associated tasks of supervising lading,reviewing documents, and verifying vehicle identification would require20 minutes. Using the estimate of 2100 vehicles entered per year (the importationrate for 1989 to date), Customs' total bond processing costs are $9,140.04,or $4.352 per vehicle. NHTSA has adopted $4.35 as the bond processing feeper vehicle.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>Section 108(c)(3)(B) requires that the fee applicable in any fiscal yearshall be established by NHTSA before the beginning of each such year. Therefore,pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), it is found that good cause is shown foran effective date that is earlier than 30 days after publication of thefinal rule. Therefore, this final rule is effective September 30, 1989,so that the fees it establishes will be applicable in Fiscal Year 1990,which begins October 1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impacts</ITAG>After considering the impacts of this rulemaking action, NHTSA has determinedthat the action is not major within the meaning of Executive Order 12291``Federal Regulation''. It implements Public Law 100-562 under which feesmay be established to cover the costs of administering the program forregistration of importers of vehicles not originally manufactured to conformto the Federal motor vehicle safety standards, of determinations that nonconformingvehicles are capable of conformity to the standards, and of reimbursingor advancing the U.S. Customs Service its costs in processing safety standardsconformance bonds. It is not significant under Department of Transportationregulatory policies and procedures. The action does not involve any substantialpublic interest or controversy. There is no substantial effect upon stateand local governments. There is no substantial impact upon a major transportationsafety program. Both the number of registered importers and vehicles forwhich determinations are established to be comparatively small, and thenumber of vehicles imported per year is estimated to be less than 3000.Nevertheless, a regulatory evaluation analyzing the economic impact ofthis and the related final rules required by P.L. 100-562 has been prepared,and is available for review in the docket, as part of the Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis.NHTSA has analyzed this rule for purposes of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. The rule will not have a significant effect upon the environmentbecause it is anticipated that the annual volume of motor vehicles importedthrough registered importers will not vary significantly from that existingbefore promulgation of the rule even with the imposition of fees to bepaid by registered importers.The agency has also considered the effects of this rule in relation tothe Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this rule will not havea significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities.Although entities that currently modify nonconforming vehicles are smallbusinesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agencyhas no reason to believe that a substantial number of these companies couldnot pay the fees imposed by this regulation. However, some small businessescurrently conforming vehicles may not choose to register as importers becauseof the fee and other requirements. Accordingly, these businesses will nolonger be able to perform conformance work on vehicles imported on or afterJanuary 31, 1990. The cost to owners or purchasers of modifying nonconformingvehicles to conform with the safety standards may be expected to increaseto the extent necessary to reimburse the registered importer for the feespayable to the agency for the cost of administering the registration programand to compensate Customs for its bond processing costs. Governmental jurisdictionswill not be affected at all since they are generally neither importersnor purchasers of nonconforming motor vehicles.The agency has analyzed the proposed rule in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 ``Federalism'' and determinedthat the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 594</ITAG>Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles.In consideration of the foregoing, a new part 594, <T3>Schedule of Fees Authorized by the National Traffic and Motor VehicleSafety Act, </T3>is added to Title 49, Chapter V, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 594 SCHEDULE OF FEES AUTHORIZED BY THE NATIONAL TRAFFIC AND MOTORVEHICLE SAFETY ACT.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.1 Scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.2 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.3 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.4 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.5 Establishment and payment of fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.6 Annual fee for administration of the registration program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.7 Fee for filing petition for a determination whether a vehicleis eligible for importation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.8 Fee for importing a vehicle pursuant to a determination madeon the Administrator's initiative.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">594.9 Fee for reimbursement of bond processing costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority</T4>: Public Law 100-562, 15 U.S.C. 1401, 1407; delegationof authority at 49 CFR 1.50.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 594.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope.</ITAG>This part establishes the fees authorized by the National Traffic and MotorVehicle Safety Act.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 594.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.</ITAG>The purposes of this part is to ensure that NHTSA is reimbursed for costsincurred in administering the importer registration program, in makingdeterminations whether a nonconforming vehicle is eligible for importationinto the United States, and in processing the bond furnished to the Secretaryof the Treasury given to ensure that an imported vehicle not originallymanufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safetystandards is brought into compliance with the safety standards, or willbe exported, or abandoned to the United States.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 594.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability.</ITAG>This part applies to any person who applies to NHTSA to be granted thestatus of a Registered Importer, to any person who has been granted suchstatus, and to manufacturers who are not Registered Importers who petitionthe Administrator for a determination pursuant to Part 593 of this chapter.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 594.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>All terms used in this part that are defined in section 102 of the NationalTraffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (15 U.S.C. 1391) are usedas defined in the Act.``<T3>Administrator</T3>'' means the Administrator of the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration.``<T3>NHTSA</T3>'' means the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.``<T3>Registered Importer</T3>'' means any person who has been granted thestatus of registered importer under Part 592 of this Chapter, and whoseregistration has not been revoked.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 594.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Establishment and payment of fees.</ITAG>(a) The fees established by this part continue in effect until adjustedby the Administrator.
