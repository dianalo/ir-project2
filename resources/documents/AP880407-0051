The hijackers singled out three members of the Kuwaiti royalfamily, two of them women, who they said will be among the firstpassengers ``to pay a dear price,'' according to Iran's officialIslamic Republic News Agency, or IRNA.   The hijackers, armed with grenades and pistols, are demandingthe release of 17 pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists imprisonedin Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in that PersianGulf state in 1983.   Kuwait rejected the demand, calling it ``blackmail,'' but alsosent a government delegation to Mashhad airport in northeasternTehran to negotiate.   Fifty-seven passengers and crew members have been freed by theArabic-speaking hijackers since they forced the Kuwait AirwaysBoeing 747 to land at Mashhad airport on Tuesday.   That left roughly 50 hostages aboard the jumbo jet, which wascomandeered en route to Kuwait from Bangkok. All the remaininghostages were believed to be Arabs, including at least 30 Kuwaitis,and all but two of them men.   The nationality of the hijackers was not known. Hostages whohave been freed said there are five or six hijackers, all wearingmasks.   In a statement, the hijackers today said they considered thoseremaining aboard political prisoners they will use to ``settle ouraccount'' with the Kuwaiti government, said IRNA, which ismonitored in Nicosia.   As soon as the 32 left the plane at 2:30 a.m. today (7 p.m. EDTWednesday) the hijackers slammed the doors shut and switched offthe lights in the cabin, warning Iranian security forces not toapproach the aircraft, the agency said.   IRNA said the 32 hostages released today included 12 Britons,six Thais, three Pakistanis, two Austrians, two Syrians, oneJapanese, one Irish, one German, one Lebanese, one Sudanese, oneSouth Korean and one from South Yemen.   Twenty-four female hostages were released on Wednesday and aJordanian man with a heart ailment was freed on Tuesday.   In a statement issued shortly before today's release, thehijackers said they they wanted the world to know the Kuwaitgovernment severely tortures Moslem prisoners, IRNA reported.   The statement said the world must realize ``the real nature ofthe Kuwaiti rulers who have overlooked all the problems of theMoslem world, at the top of them the issue of Palestine and thebrave Palestinians who are fighting Israel.'' The hijackersstressed they would not back down from their demand, ``even if theprice is too high.''   The members of the Kuwait royal family aboard have beenidentified as Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, a businessman, and his twosisters, Ebtesam and Anware.   Tehran radio said Anware on Wednesday relayed a message to theMashhad control tower through a doctor asking the Kuwaitidelegation at the airport to negotiate with the hijackers, to askKuwait's ruling Al-Sabah family to accept the hijackers' demands.   Tehran radio said Anware ``whose voice was shaking, wasovertaken by strong physical tension and panic.''   The hijackers had contacted the control tower earlier Wednesday,asking for a doctor to be sent to the plane. After receivingtreatment from the doctor, Anware passed her message to the tower,adding that she and her sister were ``feeling alright,'' the radioadded.   Food was also brought earlier Wednesday to those still aboardthe jet.   Release of the 17 jailed Shiites has been a recurring demand ofShiite fundamentalist groups loyal to Iranian Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini that are believed to hold most of the 22 Western hostagesin Lebanon.   Many acts of terrorism in Kuwait have been blamed on ShiiteMoslems acting for Iran, which has been at war with Iraq sinceSeptember 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of aiding Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
