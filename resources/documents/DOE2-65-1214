This paper describes a method how to obtain this, by optimizationof a parameter of amplification, KQ, in the electrical control of thepower plant. A model of the wind power plant and the optimizing algorithmhave been designed and implemented in the simulation language Simnon.The optimization algorithm works in the following way. Add a testsignalto KQ so that a power variation is obtained. Estimate the crosscovariancebetween the testsignal and the power variation. The result of the estimationis then used to adjust KQ to its optimum. Simulations with the modelshows that it is possible to optimize KQ, even in wind disturbed by turbulence,when starting with wrong KQ value.</TEXT></DOC>
