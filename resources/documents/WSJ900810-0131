Traditional introductory texts used to try to sugarcoatthe student's task of memorizing the Greek verb down to andincluding the middle aorist tense by dangling in front of himEnglish cognates of Greek words. This gambit tended to defeatthe purpose of bringing the tongue of Aristotle down home,because the cognates often were words the student didn't knowin English (noetic). But, as Heraclitus said, what goesaround comes around.   These days, the Greek genius is again at work in ourspeech, right at the cutting edge of new scientific jargon.Just the other day, this page was asked to print the word&quot;biome.&quot; This is not a word you will find in Plato, but it isbuilt on a Greek suffix, -ome, indicating a group (unlikeAstrodome, which is Latin and attracts groups). Biome is evenin the American Heritage Dictionary, which defines it as &quot;acommunity of living organisms of a single major ecologicalregion.&quot; Biomedically speaking, the person who coined thisterm needs his cephalosome examined and should be exiled tosome other biosphere.</LP><TEXT>   A trend, however, is a trend. Come biome, come genome. Andyou don't have to be some chrome-domed gnome to have guessedthat genome means a group of genes. In actual fact,biologists now use genome to refer collectively to all thegenes in the human body.   Enthusiasm for this term in the biochemical community, asubset of the grant-hungry Ph.d-ome, is running high nowbecause of a scientific cash cow called the genome project,whose goal is to map every one of the 50,000 to 100,000 genesevolution has given us. Maybe this is a good thing, and maybeit will sap funding from more focused gene mapping.   Why should we care? Because the often hit-or-miss mappingof our chemical heredity has already solved major medicalmysteries and should solve others. That's the story twoJournal medical reporters, Jerry E. Bishop and MichaelWaldholz, tell in &quot;Genome,&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, $21.95, 352pages).   Their method is an extension of what they do regularly forthis newspaper, mixing solid research, lucid exposition andillustrative anecdotes in order to bring the news of medicalscience to the general public. In &quot;Genome,&quot; they combine amass of complicated material, which they shape into an alwaysgraceful flow of narrative. But this story was especiallyhard to structure, since it is really two stories. One is agrand sweeping epic of discovery that will continue until theentire genome is mapped.   This story begins with the discovery of the laws ofheredity by the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866 and goeson to the even higher drama of the discovery of the structureof the genetic material DNA in 1953. Messrs. Bishop andWaldholz (hereinafter known as B-W) provide a quick refreshercourse in all these basics and then slow down to give arichly human account of the central inspiration that turnedgene mapping into a practical business.   This bolt from the blue was actually the unexpectedculmination of years of humdrum genealogical record-keepingby the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City. By the spring of1979, when various local graduate students in biology andgenetics gathered to discuss their research at the nearby skiresort of Alta, the church had been permitting geneticists touse its archives as a data bank for the study of hereditarydiseases. At the Alta meeting, a graduate student spoke aboutattempts to map the gene causing hematochromatosis tochromosome 6. The hunt for that gene had progressed becauseresearchers had found a &quot;marker&quot; in the chromosome and linkedit with the gene. If only there were other such markers,another graduate student remarked, other diseases could bepinned down to specific genes.   In the audience was a visiting luminary named DavidBotstein. &quot;The MIT biologist,&quot; B-W write, &quot;was gaining areputation somewhat akin to that of a rock star among theyoung scientists. A large, barrel-chested man with jet-blackcurly hair and a gap-toothed smile, Botstein had acombination of self-confidence and garrulousness thatgraduate students rarely saw in their mentors. He loved totalk and relished long, often detailed accounts of histheories and concepts, of his scientific conquests, and ofother scientists' flaws.&quot;   To anyone who knew Mr. Botstein as an earnestundergraduate dropping unhappily out of a music major intoscience, because he didn't think he had what it tookmusically, this description will seem especially piquant. Butthe real interest of the story is Mr. Botstein's astoundingtheoretical improvisation at the Alta meeting, when hestarted talking and didn't stop until he had worked out howthe markers the student wanted might be found. He saw thatthe state of his science had progressed to the point wherepreviously unconnected bits of technique could be manipulatedto uncover just those markers the student had wished for.   &quot;Genome's&quot; second story is a series of episodes in whichscientists pursue those markers and, by luck and toil, findthem. It is an exciting story with profound implications forthe human future.</TEXT></DOC>
