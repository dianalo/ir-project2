The report Monday in the People's Daily was one of several in thestate-run press recently on the difficulties of drafting and keepinggood soldiers.   They have appeared as the People's Liberation Army gets ready forits annual draft, which was moved up this year from autumn to March1.   ``An army with no education is a stupid army,'' the People'sDaily said. ``In today's world where military science is flyingahead, a stupid army will fail.''   Last week, the Liberation Army Daily ran two stories on how athief and rapist became a soldier after his father gave the wife ofa military official a job. The articles said such occurrences arecommon.   Monday's People's Daily cited one regiment in which 433 menclaimed to have a high school level education. When they were givena test only 4 percent passed and 37 percent got a grade of zero.   Of the 150 new conscripts another company got last year, themajority were ``gamblers, fighters, thieves and hooligans,'' thereport said. One man was wanted for murder, another for escapingfrom jail. One headed a criminal organization.   In one division, 200 of the 733 soldiers were shorter than the5-foot-3 cut-off point.   ``Deaf mutes, sick people also become soldiers,'' the reportsaid. ``Schizophrenics, epileptics are also not rare.''   ``Everybody in my county fills in the draft form the same way,''said one illiterate soldier when asked why he claimed to have a highschool education on his draft card. ``We fill it in as we wish. Andwhatever we say, that'll do for the truth. I can't write so I had mycousin fill it in.''   A Western military analyst said the annual draft was moved upthis year to force soldiers to undergo an extra winter trainingperiod in their three years of service. The extra exercises willhelp in the selection of officers and strengthen the military's weakwinter fighting capacity, he said.   Conscription is supposed to play a key role in China's program tomodernize its military and abandon Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung'sphilosophy for guerrilla warfare, ``People's War.''   Under that strategy, China threw the largest number of people inthe smallest amount of space and tried to overwhelm its enemy. Butheavy losses suffered in 1979 during a border war with Vietnamsignaled its death knell.   Reforms in the last nine years have cut at least 1 million menfrom the military, leaving fewer than 3 million in uniform.Standards for new soldiers have been raised. Today, 70 percent ofdivisional leaders have college educations, compared with 1.6percent in 1982.   China started buying advanced weapons from the West anddeveloping its own arms industry. Last year, it reinstituted aranking system after a 23-year ban and elite fighting squads beganpractice.   Serious problems have developed in the draft, however.   Attracted by the opportunites available under current economicreforms, many men don't want to be soldiers. Others, who lack theeducational, cultural or physical standards still look to themilitary as a way out of the countryside.   ``The military is in a bind,'' said the military attache, whospoke on condition of anonymity. ``The only people who want to besoldiers are hillbillies but the system has changed. No more is itjust `a rifle and a sleeping bag and off you go, sunshine.'''   Corruption is rife as thousands of qualified men bribe officialsto let them out of military service and others who don't qualify payto get in.   In addition, the defense budget has been cut drastically, fromabout 17.5 percent of all state expenditures in 1978 to 8 percenttoday. Many officers want early retirement to seek their fortuneselsewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
