Mr. Espinosa is the fourth person to hold the Finance Ministry post in the three-year-old government of President Leon Febres-Cordero.    Patricio Quevedo, secretary-general of administration, said that Mr. Cordovez offered his resignation to the president yesterday. Mr. Cordovez resigned for personal reasons and wished to devote more time to his business interests, Mr. Quevedo said.    Mr. Cordovez admitted before a parliamentary commission last month that, as former Finance Minister Alberto Dahik's deputy, he had accepted fees from an international development agency. Mr. Quevedo yesterday said the issue of the fees had nothing to do with Mr. Cordovez's resignation.    Ecuador, which depends on oil exports for more than 60% of its foreign revenue, has been hurt by declining world oil prices and a halt of oil exports in March because of earthquake damage.    The export halt forced the nation to suspend payments for the remainder of the year on its $8.3 billion foreign debt. Several U.S. banks placed loans to Ecuador on non-accrual status in April, along with credits to Brazil.    Oil exports are scheduled to resume in August. The World Bank in early May approved an $80 million loan to Ecuador to help reconstruct the trans-Ecuadorian oil pipeline, roads and other damaged facilities. About 26 miles of the oil line were destroyed by the earthquakes and accompanying mud slides. </TEXT></DOC>
