Louis Pienaar, installed by South Africa, said there is a ``defacto suspension'' of the U.N. idependence plan, which also callsfor combatants to be confined, and ``it has become impossible tocontemplate such elections under the prevailing circumstances.''   R.F. Botha, the South African foreign minister, said he hadinformed U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar of thedecision to activate more soldiers, but he did not specify thenumber.   He said a major reason was that some guerrillas of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization were approaching areaswhere white farmers live.   In New York the U.N. Security Council held private consultationson the crisis Friday. The council president, Soviet AmbassadorAleksandr M. Belonogov, said later that after reading Botha'sletter, the council is satisfied that South Africa is committed togranting independence to Namibia .   Newspapers in Harare, Zimbabwe said the six ``front-linestates'' ofered the U.N. peacekeeping force up to 6,000 soldiers tohelp stop the fighting _ 1,000 each from Angola, Botswana,Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.   They said the decision was made Thursday at an emergency summitin Luanda, Angola.   South Africa's military said it ordered out warplanes for thefirst time Friday and reported SWAPO had brought its first tanksacross the border from Angola. Spokesman Col. Japie Dreyer saidfour jet fighters fired on SWAPO positions Thursday, killing 17guerrillas.   Botha flew to Windhoek for emergency talks Saturday withofficials from the United Nations, Cuba and Angola. Senior U.S. andSoviet diplomats will observe.   The fiercest fighting seen in the 23-year confrontation ragedacross northern Namibia on Friday, a week after a U.N.-supervisedtruce was to end the war.   At least 261 SWAPO guerrillas and 28 security force members havebeen killed since Saturday, South African police officials said.   On Thursday, SWAPO said 38 guerrillas died and nine weremissing. The guerrilla organization charges many of those killed bysecurity forces are civilians.   South Africa says SWAPO has sent more than 1,900 guerrillas intonorthern Namibia this week, in violation of an accord requiring theinsurgents remain at bases in Angola, at least 100 miles from itsborder with Namibia.   The United Nations has allowed South Africa to deploy up to sixunits of troops to support paramilitary police, but Botha saidFriday the security forces ``at the present level are not able tostem the incursion.''   Anton Lubowski, one of SWAPO's few white officials, told aWindhoek news conference the head of the U.N. operation in Namibia,Finland's Martti Ahtisaari, should be replaced immediately.   ``They (U.N. officials) are coming with exactly the samearguments as South Africa that the guerrillas must be disarmed,''Lubowski said. ``It is clear they are working with the SouthAfricans and are in the South Africans' pocket.''   Botha said of Ahtisaari: ``He's in an awful position. It wasnever his task to handle a violation of (U.N. Resolution) 435.''   The U.N. task is ``to observe, patrol and prevent borderinfiltration of a very limited nature,'' Botha said.   The United Nations authorized 4,650 troops for Namibia, but hasbeen criticized because less than 1,000 have arrived.   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said military observers willbegin pouring into Namibia during the weekend.   An 850-member contingent of Finnish observers will be airliftedby the U.S. military Saturday to Monday, and other arrangements arebeing made to fly in 850 Malaysian and 850 Kenyan troopers, he said.   U.N. officials say the independence plan made no provision forSWAPO bases in Namibia. Even Angola's President Jose Eduardo dosSantos, whose country has hosted the guerrillas since 1966,criticized SWAPO.   ``I regret the SWAPO leadership was not able to exercise totalcontrol over its guerrillas at the critical moment of the start ofResolution 435, by stopping anyone crossing the Angolan-Namibianfrontier,'' dos Santos said Thursday.   SWAPO leaders contend most of the guerrillas had been in Namibiafor some time and have no intention of accepting a surrender offerSouth Africa says will expire Saturday. A U.N. report blames theguerrillas for a ``major incursion,'' according to British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher.   Several captured guerrillas have said they returned to Namibiain search of U.N. personnel and expected no confrontations withsecurity forces.</TEXT></DOC>
