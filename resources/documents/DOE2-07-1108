A data set with 1 x 1 x 1-mm resolutioncan be generated with a 12-minute acquisition time. Sophisticated three-dimensionaldisplay algorithms allow reconstruction of planes at arbitrary anglesand full three-dimensional displays, which yield extremely useful informationfor neurosurgical planning. Additionally, the injection of contrast agentcan be simulated on the computer and communication pathways between structuresof interest can be found noninvasively.</TEXT></DOC>
