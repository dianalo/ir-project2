(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge sent evangelist Jim Bakkerdirectly to jail to start a 45-year sentence for defraudingfollowers of millions of dollars, saying people were ``sick ofbeing saps for money-grubbing preachers.''   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter on Tuesday also fined thedefrocked PTL founder $500,000, concluding that Bakker hadcontinued to milk the faithful even after his conviction foroverselling memberships in a Christian vacation retreat.   The 49-year-old television evangelist left the courtroom in legirons and handcuffs on his way to federal prison in Alabama.Depending on the outcome of an appeal, he will serve at least 10years before being eligible for parole.   Two of Bakker's former aides reported today to another,minimum-security prison in Alabama to begin serving sentences theyreceived a month ago _ more than 18 years for David Taggart and 17for his brother, James.   Prosecutors said the man who founded the once mighty PTLreligious empire raised thousands of dollars since his Oct. 5thconviction and needed to be imprisoned to stop him from using TVand the mails to raise more.   ``He's able to walk out of this courtroom today and continue toperpetuate this fraud,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller toldthe judge. ``He hasn't blinked.''   Potter read a letter that Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye,mailed last month from their new TV ministry in Orlando, Fla.,asking 300 supporters to send in $1,000 apiece to alleviate afinancial crisis.   ``Those of us who do have a religion are sick of being saps formoney-grubbing preachers and priests,'' Potter said. ``Worst ofall, it appears that Mr. Bakker feels he was deserving of his gainsfrom the little people who sent in their savings.''   Potter refrained from ordering Bakker to make restitution to hisvictims, saying that issue needed to be resolved in bankruptcycourt.   Bakker's fall from power began in 1987 with revelations about asexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn, whoreceived hush money, leading to the unraveling of the ministry.   ``I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' Bakker said beforesentencing. ``I have sinned. But never in my life did I intend todefraud anyone.''   Prosecutors didn't accept his apology.   ``This man is a con man, a common criminal,'' said Miller.``He's ready, willing and able to pick it up where he left it off.He's ready to go back to the henhouse.''   Bakker stood and stared straight ahead as the sentence was read.Potter then sent him to the medium-security federal prison atTalledega, Ala., where he arrived late Tuesday.   Warden Don Southerland said Bakker was to spend the night in acell with another inmate, and remain there a few weeks before beingassigned to another institution.   Defense attorney Harold Bender had asked that Bakker be freed onbond pending an appeal. But Potter said he posed a substantialflight risk.   ``He has supporters who think he can do no wrong and who saythey are willing to do anything for him,'' Potter said. ``I believethem.''   Bakker's 19-year-old daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, was ledsobbing from the courtroom. Mrs. Bakker did not attend the trial.   Bakker was convicted of 23 counts of fraud and one count ofconspiracy in an indictment that charged him with diverting $3.7million in ministry finances to finance his lavish lifestyle out ofthe $158 million sent him by followers.   Bakker had faced a maximum sentence of 120 years, but the judgeconsolidated the 24 counts to nine and sentenced Bakker to fiveyears on each. Potter, known as ``Maximum Bob,'' had given stiffsentences in the convictions of three top Bakker aides, RichardDortch and the Taggart brothers. The three cooperated with thegovernment in exchange for lightened sentences.   Nearly 153,000 people sent money to Bakker between 1984 and 1987to become ``lifetime partners'' at the PTL's Heritage USA retreatin nearby Fort Mill, S.C. Bakker was convicted of sellingguarantees of lodging at the retreat when he knew rooms weren'tavailable. He spent contributors' money on luxurious homes, fancycars, jewelry, vacations, an air-conditioned doghouse, a swimmingpool heated to 90 degrees, and gold-plated bathroom fixtures.   Bakker's six-week trial was delayed for three days in Septemberwhen he suffered an emotional collapse, claiming that wild animalswere attacking him. Hurricane Hugo caused a one-day delay.   Bakker resigned PTL in March 1987 after it was revealed that hehad paid Hahn $265,000 in ministry money to keep quiet about their1980 tryst.   Hahn applauded Tuesday's sentence.   ``It cannot repay those millions of dollars, and the years ofwork people did to make it, but at least it's a start,'' she saidin a telephone interview from her West Hollwood, Calif., home. ``Atleast people can feel like they won't be taken for fools.''   ``Jim Bakker's no crook,'' said Bakker supporter Helen Gordon.``The news media made him look like one.''</TEXT></DOC>
