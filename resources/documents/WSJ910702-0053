Now, that coalition is shattered -- and removingthe penalties largely rests with George Bush.   The 1986 sanctions were forged chiefly through the effortsof several GOP moderates, such as Sens. Richard Lugar ofIndiana and Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, who playedmajor roles working with Democrats to craft a legislativecompromise. These days, however, those same lawmakers aresiding with Mr. Bush in arguing that Pretoria is close tofulfilling the law's requirements for lifting the penalties-- and that it's time for the U.S. to begin bolstering ratherthan punishing the South African government.</LP><TEXT>   Pro-sanction Democrats say South Africa's government stillhas a long way to go toward dismantling apartheid. They areopposed to lifting the sanctions, which restrict U.S.business dealings with South Africa, arguing that maintainingpressure is the only way to ensure that progress continues.   &quot;The bipartisan spirit doesn't exist any more,&quot; says Sen.Lugar, who accuses the Democrats of trying to change therules now that Pretoria is on the verge of meeting therequirements of the sanctions bill. &quot;It seems to me we have amove-the-goalpost school of thought developing in Congress.&quot;   The winner of this squabble is likely to be PresidentBush. Under the law, he need only certify that five specifiedconditions have been met to lift sanctions. Mr. Bush may dothat soon, perhaps this month. Congress can overrule him onlyby passing a new sanctions bill, but that is unlikely withoutbroader-based support than the pro-sanctions forces appear tohave.   &quot;It would be difficult or even impossible to start thisall over again,&quot; concedes Democratic Rep. Mervyn Dymally ofCalifornia, a sanctions advocate and chairman of the HouseForeign Affairs subcommittee on Africa. &quot;Members of the Houseare anxious to see this matter resolved and put behind them,and I don't think the mood or the votes are there in theSenate.&quot;   Part of the Democrats' problem is that the 1986 law waswritten loosely. Back then, there wasn't a hint that SouthAfrica's white-minority government would take such steps asfreeing Nelson Mandela, the jailed black leader, or repealingthe laws that form the foundation of apartheid. Congress setthose two goals and three others and said that if SouthAfrica met them all, the penalties &quot;shall terminate.&quot;Lawmakers gave themselves no say in making thatdetermination.   Still, Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusettswarned recently that if Mr. Bush doesn't get Congress'sconsent before determining that South Africa has met thelaw's terms, &quot;the validity of his action may have to besettled in court.&quot;   Democrats argue that, while the South African governmenthas made some steps toward fulfilling the law's requirements,it still has a ways to go. For instance, the law demands thatthe government must agree to enter into &quot;good faith&quot;negotiations with black leaders. Pretoria has agreed to sucha negotiating process, and some preliminary talks have beenheld. But Democrats say this isn't the same as holding formalnegotiations.   Democratic Rep. Howard Wolpe of Michigan, a staunchsanctions advocate, contends the administration &quot;wants tototally rewrite the law.&quot; For instance, while theadministration says South Africa has ended its ban on certainpolitical parties and permits all South Africans toparticipate in the political process, Mr. Wolpe maintainsthat the government still hasn't worked out terms to permitthousands of political exiles to return home.   He also says that although Pretoria has scrapped apartheidlaws, local South Africa governments have substituted somenew rules that would keep facilities racially segregated.   Beyond the question of whether the conditions have beenfulfilled, some Democrats also complain that the conditionsin any case weren't tough enough. Sanctions, they say, shouldbe kept in place until a nonracial democracy becomes acertainty in South Africa. &quot;Nothing they've done {in SouthAfrica&quot;} is irreversible,&quot; says Rep. Edolphus Towns, a NewYork Democrat who heads the Congressional Black Caucus. &quot;Ifwe want progress to continue, we need to fight to make surewe continue sanctions.&quot;   Republicans contend that even if the penalties under the1986 bill are lifted, the U.S. still will maintain leveragebecause of other legislation still on the books that containsadditional sanctions against South Africa.   For example, the U.S. is required to vote againstInternational Monetary Fund loans to South Africa, prohibitedfrom making any sales to South Africa's military or policeand can't support most Export-Import Bank lending. The U.S.also honors a United Nations arms embargo of South Africa.   &quot;Lifting the (1986) sanctions law certainly doesn't meanit will be business as usual with South Africa,&quot; says Sen.Kassebaum.   Meanwhile, Mr. Bush, who never supported sanctions, ispushing ahead to remove them. At a meeting in South Africathis week, the African National Congress, the major blackgroup, is expected to take a tough line against the white-rungovernment. But Mr. Bush believes that South AfricanPresident F.W. de Klerk has been acting in good faith andconsulting closely with the U.S. as he sought to meet thelaw's conditions and that the U.S. must respond.   Under the sanctions law, a finding that the South Africangovernment had met four of the five conditions would beenough for Mr. Bush to lift the sanctions. But that wouldrequire him to give Congress 30 days to enact a jointresolution disapproving the decision.   By contrast, a finding that all five conditions have beenmet simply means an automatic lifting of the sanctions.Secretary of State James Baker told a private GOP lunch grouplast week that he believes South Africa has nearly met thatcriterion, and the State Department has dispatched a legalexpert to South Africa to study the issue further.   Sen. Lugar, for one, has few doubts. &quot;If we now want tosee political reconciliation in South Africa we have to startacting affirmatively,&quot; he says. &quot;Hanging onto sanctions fordear life is very unproductive.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
