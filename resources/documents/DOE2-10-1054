<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-1054 </DOCNO><TEXT>The generalized electrodynamics proposed by Podolsky is analyzed fromthe Hamiltonian point of view, using Dirac theory for constrained systems.The problem of gauge fixing for the theory is studied in detail and thecorrect generalization of the radiation gauge is obtained, a subjectwhich has not been done correctly in the early literature. The Diracbrackets for the dynamical variables in this gauge are calculate.</TEXT></DOC>
