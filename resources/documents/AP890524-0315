(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some of the nation's top computerscientists, angry over a wave of lawsuits seeking to copyrightbasic computer software, picketed Wednesday outside theheadquarters of Lotus Development Corp.   The scientists said Lotus and a handful of other computercompanies are trying to lock up rights to software that is asfundamental to computers as a steering wheel and pedals are to acar.   ``If there were copyrights like this on cars, then everymanufacturer would have to give you a different way to steer,''said Richard Stallman, a programmer at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology. ``If you learned to drive a Ford, you wouldn't knowhow to drive Chevrolets.''   Chanting slogans through a bullhorn, Stallman led about 150 MITprofessors, graduate students and programmers from Boston-areacomputer firms in a march from Cambridge's Technology Square toLotus's headquarters.   Under gray skies and intermittent rain, they picketed for aboutan hour, carrying signs saying ``Innovation Not Litigation,''``Don't Ruin Our Industry'' and ``No Writs For Bits.''   The rash of lawsuits includes complaints filed by Apple Computeragainst competitors Microsoft and Hewlett Packard, and by AshtonTate against Fox Software.   Lotus, which makes the best-selling computer accounting programLotus 1-2-3, is suing competitors Paperback Software Internationaland Mosaic Marketing Inc.   All of the suits allege illegal copying of a ``user interface,''technical jargon for what is often called the ``look and feel'' ofa computer program, including its basic commands, menus anddisplays.   Lotus and many other software companies contend that unlesstheir products enjoy strong copyright protection, they will nothave an economic incentive to develop new programs.   ``Our argument is that out-and-out copying of other people'swork stifles creativity and innovation,'' said Lotus spokeswomanBetsy Kosheff. ``Copyright law allows you to take other people'swork and build on it, but not to steal it.''   The protest grew out of an advertisement placed in an MITstudent newspaper last month by Stallman; Gerald J. Sussman, aprofessor of electrical engineering; and Marvin Minsky, founder ofMIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.   They warned that the lawsuits could freeze out new companies,make computers harder to use and, ultimately, retard the industry.   ``Until quite recently, people invented things, everybody gaveeach other all their software, we had fun and people made moneyanyway,'' Sussman said Wednesday. ``I'd like to see that comeback.''   Stallman, a prominent programmer who developed EMACS, a widelyused system for editing computer programs, said it is in the publicinterest to have computer programs share basic attributes, so usersdo not have to learn each program from scratch.   The lawsuits, he charged, will lead to ``inefficiency andgratuitous incompatibility,'' with ``a heavy cost for the economy.''   Among the protesters were Brian Kocher, president of theAssociation for Computing Machinery; Hal Abelson, a MIT professorwho helped develop the Logo educational computer language; RaySolomonoff, an eminent Boston mathematician; and Patrick Winston,head of MIT's Artificial Intelligence lab.   Stallman said the protesters have formed a new organization, theLeague for Programming Freedom, to try to pressure Lotus and otherfirms to drop the lawsuits.   In leaflets handed out at the pickets, the group urged people toboycott the firms bringing the lawsuits and to buy competingproducts instead. They also advised programmers not to go to workfor Lotus, Apple and Ashton Tate.   Copyright lawyers said the rash of ``look and feel'' lawsuitsbegan in late 1986, after a federal judge in California ruled thata small software company, Unison World Inc., had infringed acompetitor's copyright on a program for making customized greetingcards.   Since then, several companies have won similar cases, but ``eachcase, rather than settling the law, has tended to unsettle it andraise more questions,'' said Thomas M.S. Hemnes, a partner in theBoston law firm of Foley, Hoag andamp; Eliot.   Hemnes and other attorneys said the issue of how much of acomputer's basic programming can be patented eventually may bedecided by the U.S. Supreme Court.</TEXT></DOC>
