By an 8-3 vote, the Fed's open market committee decided atits Feb. 6 and 7 meeting not to push rates up or down. Thecommittee didn't lean toward any change in rates in thefollowing weeks.</LP><TEXT>   The committee met again last week. It won't disclose lastweek's decisions until mid-May, but the Fed has given noindication of any policy change in its daily dealings infinancial markets. After gradually lowering short-term ratesfor six months, the Fed paused at the end of last year.   By early February, as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has saidpublicly, the Fed concluded that the risks of recession werereceding. Most members noted &quot;some pickup in activity&quot; in theeconomy, the summary says. And it adds that most &quot;saw littleprospect that significant progress . . . would be made inreducing the underlying rate of inflation in the quartersimmediately ahead.&quot;   Although a few Fed officials regarded that as aprescription for higher interest rates, the majoritydisagreed. &quot;Such a policy would incur too much risk ofcreating financial conditions that could lead to a weakereconomy,&quot; the summary says.   Several policy makers -- their identities aren't disclosedin the summary -- &quot;observed a sense of unease and fragilityin the business and financial communities arising from suchfactors as declining profit margins, heavy debt burdens andproblems in certain sectors of the financial markets thatwere contributing to greater caution on the part of lendersand a reduced availability of credit to some borrowers,&quot;according to the summary.   None of the six Fed governors voted to raise rates, buttwo presidents of district reserve banks did. Fed Gov. MarthaSeger dissented on the side of easier policy, as she oftendoes.   Lee Hoskins, president of the Cleveland Fed, wanted animmediate tightening of the Fed's grip on credit to counterinflationary pressures. He advocated gradually tighteningmonetary policy to wring inflation out of the economy. RobertBoykin, president of the Dallas Fed, was prepared to acceptunaltered policy for the moment, but dissented because hewanted to lean toward tighter policy. He cited the &quot;risks ofdelaying decisions until there was full confirmation ofinflationary pressures.&quot;   Five of the 12 Fed bank presidents vote on monetary policyat any one time. Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Boykin began serving asvoting members at the February meeting and will continue tocast votes through year-end.   Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern cast his vote withthe majority on the direction of near-term monetary policy.But in a separate vote setting the Fed's goals for growth inthe money supply this year, Mr. Stern joined Mr. Hoskins indissenting on the side of tighter credit.   By an 8-3 vote, the open market committee decided that themoney supply, as measured by M2, should grow between 3% and7% in 1990, the same range as last year. Mr. Stern and Mr.Hoskins wanted to lower the acceptable range, arguing thatthe Fed won't be able to reduce inflation if the money supplygrows as fast as 7% this year.   Some other Fed policy makers shared that fear, the summaryindicates, but said they would go along with a 3% to 7% range&quot;if its upper limit was viewed as a firm constraint . . . andif a clear explanation was made of the committee's commitmentto achieve price stability over time.&quot; The Fed did explainthe commitment in congressional testimony later in the month.   Ms. Seger wanted to raise the growth targets to between 31/2% and 7 1/2%.   The M2 measure of the money supply includes currency aswell as checking, savings and money market accounts.</TEXT></DOC>
