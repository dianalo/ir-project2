Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, favored to win a secondseven-year term in Sunday's runoff, capped his electioneering witha final rally in the southern city of Toulouse. Campaigning isprohibited Saturday.   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac toured the south, basking inthe release in Beirut Wednesday of Marcel Fontaine, 45, MarcelCarton, 62, and Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, and in the freeingThursday of 23 French lawmen held by Melanesian separatists in NewCaledonia.   The release from exile Friday of a French spy convicted in the1985 sinking of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior increased therecent dose of good news for Chirac.   It wasn't clear how the hostage releases would affect Chirac'schances in Sunday's runoff, because polls are forbidden in thefinal week of the campaign. Most political analysts felt anybenefits would be insufficient to overcome the wide lead held byMitterrand in the final opinion surveys last week.   The last polls indicated Mitterrand was favored by 53 percent to57 percent of voters, compared to Chirac's 43 percent to 47 percentrating. The men advanced to the runoff by being the top twovote-getters in the first round of voting April 24.   In that vote, Mitterrand won 34.1 percent of the vote and Chiracwon 19.9 percent.   Attempts to keep partisan presidential politics out of thecelebration of the hostage releases lasted less than a day.   Lionel Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party, claimedChirac pushed for the releases to bolster his own campaign.``Jacques Chirac and his team is working public opinion with forcein a formidable attempt to manipulate the end of the campaign,'' hesaid Friday.   But Jacques Toubon, secretary-general of Chirac's Rally for theRepublic party, denounced what he called the ``wet blankets, thegrumblers who split hairs when they should simply be happy.''   ``An objective fact: with the government of Jacques Chirac, whenthere are hostages, they are freed,'' he added. ``For order,liberty and security, Jacques Chirac and his government are veryeffective.''   In Paris' central Place de la Concorde, 40,000 Chirac backersgathered for a final outpouring of support.   ``We have 36 hours left to convinced the undecided,'' InteriorMinister Charles Pasqua told the crowd.   ``France needs a president who decides,'' he said. ``When it wasnecessary to decide for the liberation of hostages in Lebanon,Chirac knew how to decide. When it was necessary to decide to freethe hostages in New Caledonia, Chirac knew how to decide.''   Chirac rejected allegations that his actions were motivated bythe elections. He said it was ``my duty to do everything possible,even if it could lead to critical comments, to get the last(French) hostages out of Lebanon.''   Mitterrand himself welcomed the hostage releases and made noinsinuations about his opponent.   On Thursday morning, French security forces stormed a cave inthe French island territory of New Caledonia, freeing 23 hostages.Two assault team members and 19 Melanesian separatist kidnapperswere killed.   On Friday, the government announced that Capt. Dominique Prieur,one of two French agents convicted in New Zealand of the 1985bombing of an anti-nuclear Greenpeace ship, had been allowed toleave her island exile for France. Chirac said she was freedbecause she is pregnant.   She and the other agent, who has already returned to France,were convicted of manslaughter. A photographer aboard the RainbowWarrier had been killed.   The left-leaning newspaper Le Monde questioned the coincidenceof the release of the hostages in Lebanon four days before theelection.   ``Would it be dignified and honorable under these conditions toaccept that the terrorists interfere in French political life, thatthey influence in one way or another the French people's choice ofa president?''   The newspaper also questioned the assault on the New Caledonianisland of Ouvea.   ``If these events leave a bitter taste, it is because it isdifficult to resist the idea that someone was trying to get votesin metropolitan France with blood in Ouvea. It is difficult toresist the idea that in 48 hours, Mr. Chirac wanted to playpresidential poker,'' the paper said.   Le Monde said it was difficult to believe that Mrs. Prieur'scondition required that she be repatriated just 48 hours before theelection.</TEXT></DOC>
