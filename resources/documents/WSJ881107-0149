The Spring Valley, N.Y., maker of generic prescription drugs has been under investigation by Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services since June. The government is looking into alleged payoffs to Food and Drug Administration personnel by drug companies, including Par, to obtain speedy approval of generic drug products.    Par officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Allan Tupken, a New Jersey resident, filed the suit alleging securities fraud in federal court in Manhattan. The suit seeks class-action status on behalf of individuals holding Par shares from early August through late October, and who still held the shares Oct. 21, 1988, when Par disclosed it was the target of a grand jury investigation.    The plaintiff alleges that Par knew of the government investigation as early as July 5, yet didn't mention it in its quarterly financial report issued Aug. 11. The suit alleges that as a result of the Oct. 21 disclosure, Par shares fell to $10.125 a share the next day from $12.25.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Par closed at $8.125, down 37.5 cents.    Mr. Tupken, who holds 400 common shares of Par, seeks unspecified damages. Co-defendants named in the suit are: Perry Levine, president; Ashok Patel, senior vice president; R.K. Patel, senior vice president; and Jacob Robbins, a director.    The suit charges that the officers knew of the government investigations but acted to conceal the information from the investing public. The plaintiff alleges the information was withheld to promote a misleading appearance of Par's continuing growth and profitability and to inflate the company's stock. </TEXT></DOC>
