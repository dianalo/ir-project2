Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BON PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   Soybean futures prices rose as some analysts increased their estimates of drought-related crop damage.    Although the Federal Reserve Board's increase of the discount rate depressed other markets, the move was ignored by grain traders.    The grain pits at the Chicago Board of Trade were preoccupied with forecasts for blast-furnace temperatures in the Midwest by the weekend, and by rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying corn and South American soybean meal.    At the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybean contract for August delivery rose 15.75 cents a bushel to settle at $8.5575 a bushel. On Monday, the price of most soybean contracts plunged their daily permissible limit of 30 cents a bushel in the wake of Sunday's heavier-than-expected rainfall.    Many analysts had expected futures prices to drop again yesterday; heavy rains Monday night drenched several traders gathered at the first night baseball game at Wrigley Field in Chicago. However, a wave of crop damage estimates instead sparked a rally.    &quot;I was in the stands when it rained,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago. &quot;I thought prices would fall.&quot;    Chicago crop forecaster Conrad Leslie, who conducts a widely watched survey of grain elevators and processors, said the recent heat wave trimmed the potential soybean harvest to 1.4 billion bushels from the 1.48 billion bushel figure suggested by his Aug. 1 survey. Mr. Leslie also shaved his estimate of the corn harvest to four billion bushels from 4.28 billion bushels.    Mr. Leslie's survey is one of the last private estimates the market will receive before the Agriculture Department on Thursday releases the results of an Aug. 1 field survey.    Because of the drought, most trading firms and grain merchants expect the Agriculture Department to trim its July 12 crop estimates of a 1.65 billion bushel soybean harvest and a 5.2 billion corn harvest.    However, opinions vary widely about the depth of the revisions. Private projections of the corn crop, for example, run from 3.5 billion bushels to 5.2 billion bushels. The average estimate among analysts is that the department will project a 4.35 billion corn crop and a 1.52 billion soybean harvest, based on Aug. 1 conditions.    Last year, U.S. farmers harvested 7.1 billion bushels of corn and 1.9 billion bushels of soybeans.    Meteorologists expected hot and dry conditions to return to most of the Farm Belt Thursday. A ridge of high pressure is rebuilding over the Midwest, which should prevent the development of any widespread storm systems for at least the next several days and allow temperatures to range from 95 to 105 over much of the corn belt, said Charles Notis, a meteorologist at Freese-Notis Weather Inc., Des Moines, Iowa.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   INTEREST RATES: Debt futures ended down for the day, but off the lows established earlier yesterday morning, as traders bought contracts to cover short sales made earlier in expectation of still lower prices. Dealers said talk that retail demand was sufficient at yesterday afternoon's $11 billion three-year note auction helped convince participants that interest rate futures prices had become oversold. The Treasury Department said the three-year notes -- the first leg of the Treasury's $22 billion refunding that concludes today -- averaged an 8.77% yield at the auction after prices fell sharply yesterday morning in response to news that the Federal Reserve Board pushed the discount rate a half percentage point higher to 6 1/2%. September U.S. Treasury bond futures ended 3/4 lower at 86-07. September Treasury bill futures ended six basis points lower at 92.73 and September Eurodollar futures ended eight basis points lower at 91.34. Traders largely ignored the dollar's sharp rise and concentrated on the rate rise and its implications for those holding bonds.    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and silver futures prices fell sharply in response to the Fed's boost in the discount rate. Gold for December delivery declined $3 to $437.80 an ounce. At one point the December contract traded as low as $433, just $3 above of its life-of-contract low. All other gold contracts did hit new life-of-contract lows in the bruising session. Silver settled at $6.63 an ounce for September delivery, down 8.5 cents from Monday, but well above the day's low of $6.56 an ounce. Platinum, in an apparent technical bounce, bucked the trend. The October contract advanced $2.40 to $522.30 an ounce, following a $19 plunge Monday. The Fed's discount rate boost to 6.5% from 6% helped push up the dollar, which had been down at the start of trading. &quot;The Fed move depressed gold more than silver, because gold tends to react to action in the dollar more than does silver,&quot; said Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York. Also contributing to weakness in gold, according to Fred Demler, analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, was selling of gold by the Soviet Union in Far Eastern markets and Middle Eastern selling of gold in Europe. The impending cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war also has calmed Persian Gulf tensions and this is being reflected in precious metals, he said. Yet some analysts, including Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc., New York, thought the precious metal prices were surprisingly strong in the face of the discount rate increase. &quot;If there was a time for precious metals to be killed&quot; it was yesterday, he said. &quot;Yet gold and silver didn't go down as much as the Fed's action could have made them drop and platinum actually rose,&quot; he said. He noted that platinum, in dropping down to the day's low of $512.50 attracted strong dealer demand. &quot;That's around the level where there was strong Japanese and other Far Eastern buying of platinum back in May,&quot; Mr. Savaiko said. While there was no discernible Far Eastern demand for platinum yesterday, &quot;it must have been on dealers' minds that bargain hunters might come in&quot; so they bought the platinum contract, he said.    COTTON: Futures prices rose, with the December contract settling at 54.15 cents a pound, up 1.17 cents. With many contracts trading repeatedly down to new life-of-contracts lows since Aug. 2, &quot;there had to be a correction,&quot; said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities. &quot;It was just a normal short-covering rally,&quot; he said. Tropical storm Beryl, which is sweeping across the Gulf toward Texas, shouldn't have significant impact on cotton-growing areas, Mr. Simon said. Peter Leavitt, meteorologist with Weather Services Inc., of Bedford, Mass., agreed. The storm &quot;will probably sneak in between the major cotton-growing areas of the Mississippi Delta and Texas,&quot; he said. The storm hit land at New Orleans and its heaviest rains were expected to continue moving west-northwest, across southern Louisiana into East Texas, Mr. Leavitt said. </TEXT></DOC>
