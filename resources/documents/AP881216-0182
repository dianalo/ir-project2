Wolf, 65, was not asked about his espionage activity for thecommunist state in the interview, author Henning Mueller said.   But he said the former intelligence chief, whose agents' activitytriggered the fall of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1974,talked at length about the terror of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin'srule.   Mueller used the interview as material for a book on Wolf'sfather Friedrich, a well-known Jewish doctor and dramatist. He saidhe conducted the interview earlier year in East Berlin, afterapplying to East Germany's Academy of Arts for permission.   ``It went without any problems. I applied to the academy andreceived permission,'' Mueller said in a telephone interview. ``Ibelieve this is the first and only interview Wolf gave to a Westernauthor.''   Mueller said Wolf talked at length about his family's stay in theSoviet Union during Stalin's rule and made strong statements againsthim.   Excerpts of the interview were published Friday by theFrankfurter Rundschau, a left-leaning newspaper, and their contentswere confirmed by Mueller.   In the brief excerpts, Wolf spoke of his family and ``experiencesof sorrow and repression'' under Stalin's dictatorship in the SovietUnion.   ``Our parents were deeply moved by the fate of many friends andacquaintances that were hit by (Stalin's) repressions,'' Wolf wasquoted as saying.   ``Despotism and injustice don't really go together well with theideals of the October revolution,'' he was quoted as saying.   The newspaper said similar anti-Stalin statements made by Wolf ina documentary film for East German television apparently ledauthorities to put the film into archives without ever showing it.The film is about Wolf's family.   East Germany recently banned the distribution of a Sovietmagazine which has been publishing frank accounts of Stalin's terror.   The communist state has resisted following economic and politicalreforms started by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.   Wolf's father was a Communist and fled with his wife and two sonsfrom Nazi Germany. The family first went to Switzerland and Franceand in 1934 settled in the Soviet Union.   Markus Wolf, born in 1923 near Stuttgart, lived in the SovietUnion until 1945, when he returned to the Soviet-occupied zone ofdefeated Germany.   For six years he worked as a diplomat and journalist, thenentered East Germany's intelligence organization in 1951 and becameits director in 1958.   He built up a formidable network of agents, focusing primarily onWest Germany.   For decades, Wolf was known to Western intelligence agencies onlyas the ``Man Without A Face.'' His last known photograph dated backto 1959, until a Western intelligence agent took another shot in1982 when Wolf attended the funeral of his brother Konrad.   Wolf gained notoriety in the West after the 1974 exposure ofGuenther Guillaume, a senior adviser to then-West German ChancellorBrandt, as an East German spy. The arrest of Guillaume, Wolf's topagent, led to Brandt's resignation.   Wolf's retirement in February 1987 took West German governmentand security officials by surprise. The official East German newsagency ADN said Wolf was leaving office ``at his own wish.''</TEXT></DOC>
