Group Holdings Inc., a financing unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. The step removes C.I.T. from Sandamp;P'S CreditWatch list, where it was placed in November.    The downgrades included senior debt to single-A from double-A-minus; subordinated debt to single-A-minus from single-A-plus; subordinated capital notes to triple-B-plus from single-A; and commercial paper to A-1 from A-1-plus.    Sandamp;P noted that C.I.T.'s earnings declined steadily in 1987 as credit quality of customers in energy-dependent areas deteriorated, requiring higher loss provisions. The rating concern said that while management plans to improve near-term performance, earnings will likely lag behind historical results.    A spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the Sandamp;P action. </TEXT></DOC>
