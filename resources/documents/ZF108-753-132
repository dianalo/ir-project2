Black, vice president of researchand development for IMNET Corporation, stressed that in order to implement asuccessful imaging system, it is necessary to get the basics right!andP;  Thehigh-tech fancy stuff is sexy, but the system will not be satisfactory unlessthe basics are done right.andM;He advocates a slow, phased implementation -- pausing between phases toensure everything is correct before proceeding to the next phase.andM;&quot;Images can get lost in an optical jukebox just as easily as paper can getlost in a file drawer.&quot;andP;  &quot;Just putting images on a screen is not enough.&quot;andM;The starting point: &quot;Paper is in fild folders in file cabinets.&quot;andM;Phase I: &quot;Capture the image of the paper at filing time.andP;  This is the killerstep!&quot;andP;  (Note: All other speakers have been preaching capturing the images inthe mail room.andP;  This speaker has a point that sounds valid.)andP;  &quot;If you can'tdo it at filing time, [when conditons can be controlled and there is lessurgency] you certainly can't do it in the mail room!&quot;andM;Phase II: index the folders and the individual documents within the folders.andM;Phase III: begin the automation process by putting requests (only therequest) for document retrieval online.andM;Phase IV: Add document delivery.andM;The speaker inserted a step at this point which he did not number as a phase:go back and &quot;upgrade the capture and indexing of documents.&quot;andP;  He suggeststhat this is the proper point at which to move the data capture from filingto the mail room.andP;  By now you have some experience -- and some success -- andare ready for that important step which is likely to produce problems as wellas solutions.andM;Phase V: &quot;Automate the rules of document processing.&quot;andP;  &quot;Replace people'sdecisions by computer (expert system) decisions.&quot;andP;  People should only handleexceptions to the rules.andP;  Insure that the company's standards are uniformlyapplied.andM;CAN COMMENT: We second the speaker's advice to proceed with caution, using asystematic process -- complete with incremental testing -- and not leaping inwith both feet and trying to make everything work at once.andP;  ...  said theturtle to the hare.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
