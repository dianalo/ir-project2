Last week, Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, became the latest party to be implicated in the currency-manipulation scheme, which VW says defrauded it of 473 million marks ($255 million).    Federal investigators, searching the Swiss bank account of a chief suspect in the case, discovered records of payments to a new name. That person, it turned out, was one of two personal secretaries to Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl.    In the discreet world of West German banking, it was a stunning disclosure. &quot;This thing started out as a pretty straightforward investigation, and it seems to be getting bigger and bigger,&quot; says Alex Blinkhorn, a currency trader at Chemical Bank in Frankfurt. &quot;Now there's no telling where it could all lead.&quot;    A Bundesbank employee adds, &quot;People here were shocked. We have a reputation for being very proper, and this certainly puts a scratch on that.&quot;    Although the scope of illegality of the German currency fraud pales in comparison with Wall Street's insider-trading scandal, it has nonetheless shattered the popular contention here that such financial irregularities are foreign to Germany.    The investigtion already has spawned separate probes of illicit trading practices by other banks. It has prompted some companies to lessen currency-trading volume, especially in so-called hedged transactions. Companies have adopted tighter accounting and security controls; some, for instance, now require more stringent authorization for currency transactions than normal telexed confirmation.    The investigation also is certain to lead to tighter regulation, as did the last big currency scandal, the collapse of Herstatt, a private bank, in 1974.    So far, investigators haven't found any evidence specifically linking the Bundesbank secretary, whose name has been given by German newspapers as Anneliese Klomfass, to the Volkswagen fraud. She has taken a leave of absence from the bank and hasn't been charged with a crime. Instead, the investigators believe, she may have supplied market-sensitive information to Joachim Schmidt, the 39-year-old currency broker who fled West Germany five months ago when VW revealed its loss.    Since disclosure last week of Mr. Schmidt's connection to the Bundesbank, Frankfurt traders have been abuzz with speculation that he may have had accomplices in other trading houses. &quot;It makes you wonder, 'Who else is involved?'&quot; says one trader.    Adding to that speculation was a report earlier this month in a Frankfurt stock exchange newsletter, Der Platow Brief. The newsletter, which broke the news of VW's currency loss months before the company's official statement in March, said federal bank examiners were investigating 10 foreign banks for irregularities in currency trading.    German banking rules limit the volume of a bank's currency trading to 30% of its capital. But some banks, according to the newsletter, found a way around this rule by &quot;parking&quot; foreign-exchange positions with industrial companies, then buying them back the next day at a slightly higher rate.    Investigators are still sifting through Mr. Schmidt's involvement in the currency swindle. This much is known: VW became aware that something was amiss in its foreign-exchange dealings as early as last November. It conducted an internal investigation then, which apparently revealed nothing.    In February, however, the fraud came to light when the auto maker tried to act on a forward contract, listed on its books as due, with the Hungarian National Bank. But when Volkswagen officials contacted the Hungarians, they were told that no such contract existed. VW later discovered that the contracts it held were fraudulent -- exposing it to huge losses because of its uncovered currency positions -- and that its own computer tapes had been altered to cover the fraud. Mr. Schmidt, who worked out of the now-vacant offices of Schmidt andamp; Partner KG in Frankfurt's expensive West End neighborhood, was the broker on the transaction. In March, he disappeared.    The uproar over the loss nearly led to the ouster of VW Chairman Carl Hahn, whose position was bolstered in July by an independent auditors' report clearing most of the management and the supervisory board of any responsibility. Two senior financial executives were dismissed, and six were suspended. Volkswagen has filed numerous law suits to recoup its losses.    As for Mr. Schmidt, his whereabouts are unknown. There are unconfirmed reports he has been sighted in the U.S. and Switzerland. Also mentioned have been such hideaways as New Zealand and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.    Officials admit they still don't have a clue.&quot;It will be impossible to ever establish what really happened without Schmidt,&quot; says one Frankfurt broker. </TEXT></DOC>
