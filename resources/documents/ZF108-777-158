(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Seeing the LightandM;Users naturally have reservations where any nascent, unproven technology isconcerned, and FDDI is no exception.andP;  Despite the promise of asuper-resilient and compact physical medium with enormous bandwidth, usershave been more curious than eager about FDDI, or Fiber Distributed DataInterface, networks.andP;  Few users have been willing to commit to thefiber-based topology, especially since the standard has not yet beenfanalized.andP;  Furthermore, FDDI is still viewed as a specialized topology,practical only as a high-speed backbone for large corporate users who canafford the substantial investment, or for installations with graphics, orother bandwidth-intensive applications.andM;The grueling standardization process for FDDI is now entering its finalstages, with the Physical layer, the MAC layer, and Station Managementportions completed.andP;  The standard has been submitted to the American NationalStandards Institute (ANSI) for accreditation and will, as a matter of course,also be accepted by the International Standards Organization (ISO).andM;Station Management (SMT), the network management portion, was arguably moreimportant for FDDI than for any other LAN topology because of the kinds ofapplications FDDI is best suited for.andP;  Initially anyway, FDDI will be used incampus-wide networks, as a backbone connecting numerous smaller LANs thatwill need to be managed both individually and globally.andP;  Users who may havegone ahead and committed to FDDI with only the physical specifications agreedupon by the standards committees are being forced to wait for the entirestandard to be finalized.andM;If end users are being cautious about FDDI, the manufacturers are not.andO;Nearly all the fiber optic vendors have FDDI products either already shippingor under development, and manufacturers of related products are adding FDDIcapabilities.andP;  The IEEE 802.6 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) committee iseven developing a standard for city-wide public networks that would beaccessed by more than one user or corporation, FDDI is one medium that can beused in an 802.6 network.andM;John Hale, president of Fibronics, feels that FDDI is a technology driven bythe computer industry.andP;  &quot;It's a derivative market,&quot; says Hale.andP;  &quot;It's notunusual to see sophisticated users with workstations with 20 or 30 MIPS.andO;FDDI can distribute that power.&quot;andM;Fibronics has been aggressive in the FDDI marketplace and was the firstvendor to bring FDDI products to market.andP;  Prior to the availability of theFDDI Supernet chip set from Advanced Micro Devices, Firbronics implementedthe necessary logic on several circuit boards.andP;  The company has provided FDDIproducts for high-powered users such as Martin Marietta and NASA andintellectually lofty users such as Cambridge University.andM;One User's NeedsandM;Ontario Hydro, Canada's largest electrical facility, is another of Fibronics'customers and is typical of today's FDDI user.andP;  The Toronto, Ont.-basedresearch division recently implemented what is believed to be Canada's firstFDDI installation.andP;  Ontario Hydro had several special requirements that madeFDDI the natural choice.andP;  First, the company had numerous Ethernet LANsspread over several buildings on its research division campus, including somein high-voltage areas where copper couldn't be used reliably.andP;  Second, theresearch division also needed to communicate with two remote locations: thecompany's administrative offices in downtown Toronto and the University ofToronto's computer center.andP;  Finally, Ontario Hydro did not want any type ofproprietary solution.andP;  It was committed to an open-systems, standards-basedapproach to networking.andM;According to Neville Pereira, supervisor of the research division'sIntegrated Computing Environment (ICE) section, FDDI was chosen because, as atechnology, it solved both the business and technical needs of Ontario Hydro.andO;On the business side, Ontario Hydro needed the additional productivity aswell as the credibility and competitive edge that the advanced technologywould provide.andP;  By improving its networking capability, Ontario Hydro wouldbe able to optimize its funding, purchasing a small number of expensiveworkstations and distributing their power among may users.andP;  Also, with acarefully planned system, a smaller support staff could provide online helpfor troubled users.andM;Technically, Ontario Hydro wanted increased bandwidth to take advantage ofthe processing power of some of its high-end equipment.andP;  One of the researchdivision's main investment is a Silicon Graphics machine used forenvironmental modeling.andP;  The software that runs on the main graphics machinecan also run on smaller graphics workstations, so the main machine does thecompute-intensive work and then distributes it to the smaller workstationsover a network.andM;In addition to the graphics machine, Ontario Hydro has numerous IBM PCs,Apple Macintoshes, and UNIX-based machines in its research division.andP;  &quot;Theidea is that a personal computer is personal,&quot; says Pereira.andP;  &quot;Users shouldbe able to choose the workstation that suits them best.&quot;andP;  Besides thegraphics applications, services provided over the extended network includeparallel processing-based computing and more basic functions like electronicmail.andM;A Mile of FiberandM;The FDDI backbone connects 11 buildings on the research division's KiplingAvenue campus in two logical rings -- one primary and one backup.andP;  Thebasement of the main building serves as the hub of the network, with fiberoptic cables feeding out to the wiring closets of two other buildings.andP;  Thewiring closets within each building were already connected withFDDI-compliant cable.andP;  (Although the FDDI standard specifies 62.5/100 micron,multimode cable, users with single-mode fiber installed--phone companies area good example, having used singlemode fiber for voice for years--can takeadvantage of the technology with singlemode adapters.)andP;  The remaining eightbuildings, which have smaller staffs and fewer computers, are connected offthe main three buildings.andP;  All in all, 6,000 feet of fiber connect thecampus.andM;Fiber is not limited to the FDDI backbone, however.andP;  One of Ontario Hydro'sresearch areas is a high-voltage electrical lab where research engineersperform power systems-related tests.andP;  By its nature, the lab generates agreat deal of electric noise, which severely affects the performance ofcopper cable.andP;  Since light is used to transmit data over fiber optic cable,it is immune to electrical interference.andP;  Instead of running fiber to thewiring closet and copper wire to the desktop, as in the other LANs, OntarioHydro's network planners connected the users' workstations directly to thefiber cable.andM;The FDDI backbone links smaller networks, based on thin Ethernet.andP;  They chosethin Ethernet primarily because of the difficulty in predicting the number ofresearchers in any one lab at any time.andP;  With thin Ethernet, one drop couldsupport up to 29 nodes, giving the planners at Ontario Hydro the flexibilityto move users around as needed.andP;  Optical Data Systems (Richardson, Texas)provided the Ethernet hubs which have an unusual feature that offersthroughput enhancements sometimes critical for the bandwidth-intensiveapplications run at Ontario Hydro.andP;  If the number of packet collisions on theEthernet increases to an unacceptable level, a person can flick a switch onthe hub to increase the amount of bandwidth used by the Ethernet traffic onthe fiber.andM;The FDDI components supplied by Fibronics are four Ethernet-to-FDDI learningbridges--three installed and one yet to be implemented.andP;  As with allMAC-layer bridges, these are protocol-transparent, which is an advantage inOntario Hydro's multivendor, multiprotocol environment.andP;  Bridges use nodeaddresses, not a packet's protocol type, to deliver data to its finaldestination.andP;  A bridge examines the source and destination addresses of apacket to decide whether to forward the packet from a subnetwork to abackbone and off again.andM;Fibronics' devices are encapsulating as opposed to translating bridges, whichmeans that the data packets are simply encased with information bits thatallow them to travel over FDDI networks.andP;  The translating bridge wouldactually reorder the information in the packets before sending it out overFDDI, then retranslate it into an Ethernet packet once it had reached itsdestination LAN.andP;  Although translating bridges are considered necessary froman open-systems standpoint, they are slower than their encapsulatingcounterparts and more difficult to design.andP;  Since the standard was onlyrecently finalized, there aren't any translating bridges available as yet,although most vendors have products in development.andM;Remote DataandM;The research division needs to communicate with two remote sites.andP;  The firstis Ontario Hydro's data center in downtown Toronto, 12 miles from the KiplingAvenue site.andP;  The connection would allow researchers to communicate moreeffectively with their colleagues and clients in the central office.andP;  Theresearch division can then also take advantage of the computing resources ofthe IBM 3090 mainframe at the downtown site.andM;The research division must also communicate with the University of Toronto.andO;Ontario Hydro has several cooperative research and business programs that itruns in conjunction with the university, so the two sites need ot maintainfairly regular contact.andP;  Furthermore, the research division needs to takeadvantage of the university's Cray, one of the most powerful computers inCanada.andP;  The research division can offload the compute-intensive simulationit conducts in its experiments to the Cray supercomputer over thelong-distance FDDI network.andM;In addition to the three bridges that connect the Kipling Avenue campus, afourth bridge connects to a distance extender (which is basically an FDDIrepeater) that lets the research division communicate with the other twosites.andP;  Says Pereira, &quot;The idea is to eventually connect all three sites intoone FDDI ring.&quot;andM;Fault ToleranceandM;Redundancy is critical to Ontario Hydro's network.andP;  And fault tolerance isinherent in the dual, counter-rotating physical structure of an FDDI network.andO;The network is laid out in two logical rings, one of which can take over ifthe primary ring should fail.andP;  Another advantage of the two-ring capabilityis that it can increase FDDI's already enormous bandwidth potential from100Mbps to 200Mbps.andP;  However, this kind of load sharing does not conform tothe FDDI standard.andM;Although the individual buildings are wired with FDDI-compliant cable, usersare not restricted to using FDDI only.andP;  If the backbone should fail or betaken down for maintenance, users can continue to work over fiber opticEthernet by using path cables.andM;In areas that are not electrically noisy, copper wire is still in place,which adds another dimension to the redundancy inherent in the system.andO;Researchers tend to work in groups connected by a single LAN.andP;  Even if theentire fiber network whoudl fail, many groups would be able to continueworking until the system was repaired.andM;Ontario Hydro's investment in FDDI, which has cost the company between$100,000 and $200,000 so far, accounts for only about one-tenth of the totalvalue of the network, a decision that reflects the cautious approach alwaystaken to a new technology.andP;  &quot;We chose FDDI because we wanted to be on theleading edge,&quot; says Pereira, &quot;but we didn't want to invest a great deal ofmoney while the standard was still being set.&quot;andM;Now that the standard is nearly finalized, Pereira seeks to connect all thecompany's resources on a large fiber network.andP;  Eventually, says Pereira, theFDDI network will be connected to T-1 and T-3 high-speed, telecommunicationslines as well.andP;  While Fibronics is not disclosing any definite plans aboutT-1 and T-3 capability, Hale says it's a company strategy.andM;The Future of FDDIandM;Hale is confident about the future of the fiber optic-based technology,especially with regard to campus- and city-wide networking.andP;  FDDI can be usedfor campus-wide networking not only horizontally, as in the Ontario Hydroinstallation, but vertically as well.andP;  Many office buildings contain a singlecompany with numerous networked departments on different floors.andP;  Because ofits bandwidth potential, a few slender strands of FDDI-compliant fiber canreplace entire elevator shafts jammed with coax.andM;FDDI is also instrumental in MAN technology, and the implications aredizzying, especially for industries in which a lot of the business transactedis within a single city, like the financial or medical markets.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
