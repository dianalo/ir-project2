Current induced in the electrode due to      corona effects or arc current pulses due to a defect in the insulation are      sensed by a current sensing transformed circuit to develop a insulation      condition voltage signal. The insulation condition voltage signal together      with a low voltage test signal proportional to the magnitude of the high      AC test voltage potential are coupled to a remotely located controlled      unit. A negative peak detector receives the low voltage potential to      produce a bias voltage at the input to the fault detection circuit. The      characteristics of the current sensing transformed circuit are such that      current induced in the test electrode due to corona effects are shunted to      ground reference voltage potential. Arc current pulses induced in the test      electrode cause the insulation condition voltage signal to be produced at      sufficient magnitude to exceed the bias voltage at the control unit and      cause the fault detection circuit to provide a fault indication signal      representation of a flaw or defect in the insulation of the portion of the      insulated electrical conductor within the test electrode. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates generally to fault testing of insulation      applied to a cable, wire or other elongated electrical conductor and deals      more particularly with an improved insulation testing apparatus of the      type wherein an alternating current high test voltage is applied between      the insulation and the conductor to reveal holes, voids or other      imperfections in the insulation. </PAR><PAR>  Insulated electrical conductors, such as wire or cable, are usually      subjected to a high voltage test prior to use as a check against any      unseen imperfections which may be present in the insulation. This test may      be made either as the insulation is extruded onto the conductor or may be      performed in some subsequent operation. Generally, the insulated      conductor, the conductor of which is suitably grounded, is passed through      an electrode of some type which applies a high voltage to the outer      surface of the insulation. Testing apparatus of this type is disclosed in      U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,418,570; 3,510,763; 3,514,696; and 4,952,880 issued to      Clinton and to which patents reference may be made for a detail      description of such testing devices and which disclosures are incorporated      herein by reference. </PAR><PAR>  In the AC testing of insulated wire or cable by means of an in-line      application of a high test voltage applied between an electrode around the      outside of the insulation and the grounded conductor, it is desirable to      detect the smallest possible arc from the electrode to the conductor      through a pin hole, crevice or other imperfection in the insulation. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, it is also desirable to prevent the normal corona discharge      which occurs in the air spaces between the elements of the electrode and      the insulation surface from producing erroneous indications of a fault      condition by the detecting means. </PAR><PAR>  A drawback of known testing apparatus is that their designs are such to      compromise low current arc sensitivity to achieve a measure of immunity to      corona discharge. </PAR><PAR>  A further drawback to known testing apparatus is the sensitivity of the      detectors used are degraded by the capacitance in the cable linking the      high voltage transformer to the remotely located fault detector. </PAR><PAR>  It is further desirable that the control unit or fault detecting means in      such testing apparatus be separate and remotely located from the testing      station and the high voltage potential transformer used to excite the      electrode by distances of up to 100 meters without degradation of      performance of the apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  It is a general aim therefore of the present invention to provide an      enhanced sensitivity to low current fault arcs while preventing normal      corona discharge from being erroneously detected as a insulation fault. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further aim of the present invention to locate the fault detection      means at some distance from the high voltage transformer without altering      the detection characteristics of the fault detection means. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Apparatus for testing the insulation of an insulated electrical conductor      passing through an electrode is presented in accordance with the present      invention wherein a high frequency AC test voltage produced by a high      voltage potential transformer is coupled to an electrode which is in      proximity to the surface of the insulation of the portion of the insulated      conductor within the electrode. Current sensing means coupled in series      with the high voltage potential transformer and test electrode senses      electrical current induced in the test electrode and develops an      insulation condition voltage signal representative of the condition of the      insulation of the insulated conductor within the test electrode. The high      voltage potential transformer has a low voltage winding for producing a      low test voltage potential signal at the test frequency. </PAR><PAR>  A control unit located remotely from the testing station is coupled to the      current sensing means by way of a twisted wire pair to couple an      insulation condition voltage signal developed by the current sensing means      to the control unit. A fault condition voltage signal proportional to the      magnitude of the insulation condition voltage signal is developed by the      current sensing means. The AC low test voltage signal is also coupled to      the control unit and a bias voltage potential proportional to the      magnitude of the high test voltage is developed and coupled to the fault      detection circuit means. The fault detection circuit means produces a      fault indication signal in response to the magnitude of the fault      condition voltage signal exceeding the magnitude of the bias voltage      potential whereby fault in the insulation of an insulated conductor within      the test electrode is detected. </PAR><PAR>  The characteristics of the current sensing means are such that current      induced in the test electrode due to corona effects are shunted to ground      reference voltage potential due to the frequency characteristics of the      current sensing means. In contrast, current induced in the test electrode      due to arc current pulses caused by the presence of a fault or defect in      the insulation of an insulated electrical conductor within the test      electrode are sensed by the current sensing means and an insulation      condition voltage signal sufficient to overcome the bias voltage potential      and cause the fault detection circuit means to produce a fault indication      signal. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Other features and advantages of the present invention will become readily      apparent from the following written description taken in conjunction with      the following drawing wherein; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an electrical circuit schematic diagram showing one embodiment of      the insulation testing apparatus of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Turning now to the drawing and considering the invention in further detail,      FIG. 1 is an electrical circuit schematic diagram of the insulation      testing apparatus of the present invention and is generally designated 10.      An insulated electrical conductor 12 is passed through a test electrode      generally designated 14 and located at a testing station generally      designated 15. The actual conducting portion 16 of the conductor 12 under      test may be grounded to a ground reference voltage potential 18. The test      electrode 14 may take various forms and for example, may be a generally      conventional bead chain as illustrated or a flare mouth electrode or other      form generally well known to those skilled in the art. </PAR><PAR>  In the illustration of FIG. 1, the various circuit components and parts of      the testing device are shown arranged and interconnected and are usually      contained within a protective enclosure (not shown). The testing station      15 of the apparatus 10 includes a high voltage potential transformer      generally designated 20 and includes a primary winding 22, a high voltage      secondary winding 24 and a low voltage secondary winding 26. An AC source      represented by the function block 28 is connected to the terminals 30,32      of the primary winding 22 and is used to excite the high voltage      transformer 20. One end 34 of the high voltage secondary winding 24 is      connected to the electrode 14 by the conductor 36 to apply a high AC      voltage to the electrode 14. The AC source 28 is adjustable to provide an      output excitation voltage at a desired test frequency and at a desired      magnitude to cause the high voltage potential transformer to produce a      desired AC high test voltage potential. </PAR><PAR>  A current sensing transformer generally designated 38 includes a primary      winding 40 and a secondary winding 42. One end 44 of the primary winding      40 is connected to the low potential end 46 of the high voltage secondary      winding 24 of the transformer 20. The opposite end 48 of the primary      winding 40 is connected to the ground reference potential 18. A small      value capacitor 50 is connected in parallel with the primary winding 40      across the terminals 44 and 48. The current sensing transformer 38 is      typically and preferably made of a ferrite core construction with      operating characteristics to permit efficient transformation of current      and voltage at frequencies above 30 kilohertz and very inefficient      transformation of current and voltage at frequencies below 10 kilohertz      which is the typical testing frequency generated by the AC source 28. </PAR><PAR>  The secondary winding 42 of the current transformer 38 has its respective      ends 52,54 connected to the ends 53,55 of a twisted wire pair designated      56 which twisted pair is contained in a connecting cable or protective      sheath 58. The connecting cable 58 electrically connects the testing      station and the portion of the testing apparatus located near the      electrode 14 to the control portion shown generally in the dashline box 60      of the testing apparatus which is located some distance remote from the      electrode. An additional wire 62 in the conductor 58 has one end connected      to the end 64 of the low voltage secondary winding 26 of the high voltage      potential transformer 20. </PAR><PAR>  The control portion 60 includes a transformer generally designated 66 which      is similar in design and characteristics to the current sensing      transformer 38. The primary winding 68 of the transformer 66 has its      respective ends 70,72 connected to ends 74,76 respectively of the twisted      wire pair 56. The transformer 66 includes a secondary winding 78 across      which respective ends 80,82 a resistor 84 is connected in parallel. The      value of the resistor 84 is selected to cause the primary winding 68 of      the transformer 66 to present an impedance match to the twisted pair 56      such that the characteristics of the transformer 66 match the      characteristic impedance of the twisted pair at frequencies above 30      kilohertz. </PAR><PAR>  The end 80 of the secondary winding 78 of transformer 66 is connected to      the anode 86 of the diode 88. The cathode 90 of diode 88 is connected to      one end 92 of resistor 94 and one end 96 of capacitor 98 and to the base      terminal 100 of the NPN transistor 102. The end 104 of resistor 94 and end      106 of capacitor 98 and the emitter terminal 108 of the transistor 102 are      connected to ground reference voltage potential 18. The collector terminal      110 of the transistor 102 is connected to one end 112 of capacitor 114,      the base terminal 116 of the NPN transistor 118 and to one end 120 of      resistor 122. The opposite end 124 of the capacitor 114 is connected to      the ground reference voltage potential 18. The emitter terminal 126 of the      transistor 118 is connected to the anode 128 of diode 130 and to ground      reference voltage potential 18 via the cathode 132 of the diode 130. The      collector terminal 134 of the transistor 118 is connected to one end 136      of resistor 138 and to the input 140 of a fault trigger circuit shown      generally by the function block 142. The ends 144 and 146 of the resistors      122 and 138, respectively are connected to a positive DC voltage potential      generally designated 148. </PAR><PAR>  The output 150 of the fault trigger circuit means 142 is connected to the      input 152 of a process control relay shown generally by the function block      154 and to the input 156 of an operator alarm device shown generally by      the function block 158. The fault trigger circuit 142 generates an output      voltage pulse of a predetermined duration in response to a positive      voltage pulse present at its input 140 and which output pulse operates the      process control relay 154 and actuates the operator alarm 158. </PAR><PAR>  One end 160 of the wire 62 contained within the connecting cable 58 is      connected to the cathode 162 of the diode 164. The anode 166 of the diode      164 is connected to the anode 168 of the zener diode 170 and to one end      172 of capacitor 174. The opposite end 176 of the capacitor 174 is      connected to the ground reference voltage potential 18. The anode 178 of      the zener diode 170 is connected to one end 180 of resistor 182. The      opposite end 184 of the resistor 182 is connected to one end 186 of      resistor 188 and to one end 190 of capacitor 192 and to one end 82 of the      secondary winding 78 of the transformer 66. The opposite ends 194 and 196      of capacitor 192 and resistor 188 respectively are connected to the ground      reference voltage potential 18. </PAR><PAR>  When the testing apparatus 10 is operated, the AC source 28 energizes the      high voltage potential transformer 20 causing it to apply a high AC test      voltage between the electrode 14 and the conductor 16 of the insulated      conductor 12 being tested. It can be seen that the circuit is completed      from the electrode 14 through the high voltage secondary winding 24      through the primary winding 40 of transformer 38 to the ground reference      voltage potential 18 and accordingly, to the conductor 16 of the insulated      conductor 12 under test. </PAR><PAR>  If the insulation of the conductor 12 under test does not have a defect,      any current flowing in the secondary winding 24 is due to reactive current      flow through wiring capacitance shown in phantom and designated generally      200, and the reactive current through the capacitance 202 also shown in      phantom and which capacitance 202 represents the capacitance of the length      of insulated conductor 12 within the electrode 14. Superimposed on the      current flowing in the winding 24 are short pulses of random polarity,      duration and time spacing intervals due to the ionization of the air      spaces between the bead chain elements 17,17 of the electrode 14 and the      surface of the insulation of the cable 12 under test. The short duration      pulses are characterized by fast rise times and low average energy      content. </PAR><PAR>  Any current flowing in the secondary winding 24 of the transformer 20 flows      through the primary winding 40 of the transformer 38 apart from a      substantial portion of the corona caused current pulses which flow through      the capacitor 50 to the ground reference voltage potential 18. As a result      of the shunting of corona caused current pulses away from the winding 40,      relatively little voltage is induced in the secondary winding 42 of the      transformer 38. Additionally, due to the desired characteristics of the      transformer 38 to attenuate the low frequencies generally used for testing      purposes, the reactive current due to the wiring capacitance 200 and      capacitance 202 of the cable under test and which flows in the winding 40      of the transformer 38 does not produce a significant voltage in the      secondary winding 42 of the transformer 38. </PAR><PAR>  The relatively small magnitude of the corona caused voltage induced in the      winding 40 is transmitted over the twisted wire pair 56 which functions as      a transmission line terminated in its characteristic impedance by the      action of the transformer 66 and resistor 84. Any remaining voltage at the      test frequency transmitted over the twisted pair 56 is further attenuated      by the transformer 66 and is rendered negligible at the secondary winding      78. </PAR><PAR>  A low voltage at the test frequency is coupled from the low voltage winding      26 of the high voltage transformer 20 to a negative peak rectifier formed      by the diode 164 to charge the capacitor 174 to produce a negative DC      voltage potential proportional to the high voltage test potential produced      across the winding 24 of the transformer 20. The negative voltage      potential developed across the capacitor 174 is further reduced by the      voltage drop across the zener diode 170 and a portion of the reduced      voltage which is determined by the voltage divider action of resistors 182      and 188 is applied to the end 82 of the secondary winding 78 of the      transformer 66. The voltage magnitude determined by the voltage divider is      accordingly applied to the anode 86 of the diode 88 as a negative offset      or delay bias voltage which prevents the diode 88 from conducting until      the induced voltage across the winding 78 exceeds this bias value. The      offset voltage is therefore automatically adjusted to prevent diode 88      from conducting at any of the various test voltages used and at any      condition of corona in the electrode 14. The transistor 102 is in a      nonconductive state and transistor 118 is held in conduction by the      resistor 122 causing the collector 134 of the transistor 118 to remain at      a level of approximately one volt. With approximately one volt present at      the collector 134 of the transistor 118, sufficient voltage is not present      to operate the fault trigger circuit 142 and accordingly, no fault      indication would be indicated to the operator. </PAR><PAR>  The value of resistor 94 is chosen to fix the voltage potential at the base      100 of the transistor 102 at zero. The value of capacitor 98 is selected      to prevent the voltage potential at the base 100 of the transistor 102      from being influenced by extraneous electric fields which may occur during      the testing process. </PAR><PAR>  In the instance where a fault or defect in the insulation of the conductor      12 is within the electrode 14, an arc will occur from the electrode 14 to      the conductor 16 of the insulated conductor 12. The current flowing in the      arc is highly dependent on the geometry of both the fault or defect in the      insulation itself and the electrode-air interface but, in any event at      least one pulse of current is generated which has a short rise time and a      magnitude dependent upon the arc current. </PAR><PAR>  The arc current pulse or pulses produced due to the defect in the      insulation in the insulated cable within the electrode flows through the      secondary winding 24 and through the secondary winding 40 of the current      transformer 38. The frequency spectrum of these arc current pulses are      generally within the efficient range of operation of the transformers 38      and 66. The arc current pulses are propagated into the twisted wire pair      56 and appear across the transformer winding 68 of the transformer 66      without distortion independent of the length of the connecting cable 58.      In general, these arc current pulses are of a greater magnitude and a      longer duration than the corona pulses and are generally not effected very      much by the action of the capacitor 50. As a result, the voltage induced      in the transformer winding 78 exceeds the negative offset bias voltage and      the voltage drop of the diode 88. The diode 88 will now conduct current to      the base 100 of the transistor 102 causing the transistor to become      conductive to discharge the capacitor 114 and to interrupt the current      flowing to the base terminal 116 of the transistor 118 causing the      transistor to become nonconductive. The voltage potential at the collector      terminal of the transistor 118 will rise to the magnitude of the voltage      potential 148 and remain at that voltage potential for a minimum time      defined by the RC time constant developed by the values of resistor 122      and capacitor 114. The rise in the voltage potential at the collector      terminal 134 of the transistor 118 triggers the fault trigger circuit 142      which generates a current pulse at its output 150 of a time duration      sufficient to operate the process control relay 154 and the operator alarm      158. </PAR><PAR>  Apparatus for testing flaws in the insulation of an electrical conductor      passing through an electrode has been described above in a preferred      embodiment. It will be recognized that numerous changes and modifications      may be made to the values of the various circuit components and also to      the configuration of the functioning circuits without departing from the      scope of the invention. Therefore, the invention has been described by way      of illustration rather than limitation. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
