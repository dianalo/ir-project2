Jan Urban, a leading member of the Charter 77 human rightsmovement and other pro-democracy groups, was taken from his home bypolice at 5:30 a.m., said the source, who asked not to beidentified.   Sources in Prague said Urban was released abouutu four hourslater after apparently being warned not to engage in furtherdissident activity.   Jiri Hajek, Czechoslovakia's foreign minister during the 1968Prague Spring, was among those arrested Thursday and held forseveral hours by police who raided a meeting the activists wereholding with international human rights campaigners. U.S. humanrights monitor Jeri Laber also was briefly detained.   Police have made at least three other police raids on activistsover the past week.   Czechoslovakia's Communist authorities, unlike theircounterparts in neighboring Hungary and Poland, have firmlyrejected dialogue with opposition groups who seek a more opensociety.   A wave of pro-democracy demonstrations in January has beenanswered with carefully targeted harassment of leading activistsand the jailing of lesser known campaigners whose detention stirsless protest at home and abroad.   The current wave of harassment may be connected with theupcoming Oct. 28 anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence in1918.   Last year, about 5,000 peaceful demonstrators gathered at abanned rally to mark the anniversary and were dispersed by policeusing water cannon, tear gas, dogs and batons.   The Communist party daily Rude Pravo has already warned thatanybody attending a similar rally this year could face prosecution.</TEXT></DOC>
