It would replace provisions thatbecame effective on October 1, 1986, but which were subsequently suspendedby FEMA in a June 30, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice and later by the Supplemental AppropriationsAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-71). In addition, provisions are included regardingthe application of these requirements to certain recreational vehicles.Prior to developing this proposed rule, FEMA reviewed the comments submittedin response to the June 30, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, conducted further research into the impactsof flooding on existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions, and developeda report for Congress entitled ``National Flood Insurance Program: Reporton Existing Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions''. That report concludedthat there were alternatives to the October 1, 1986 rule revision thatwould reduce the adverse economic impacts on the owners and residents ofexisting manufactured home parks and subdivisions, yet still achieve theNFIP objectives of reducing flood damages and threats to public safety.After submitting that report to Congress in September of 1988, FEMA metwith a task force chaired by the National Manufactured Housing Federationwhich made additional recommendations to FEMA in February of 1989. Theproposed rule contains elements of both the alternative developed by FEMAin its report for Congress and the recommendations of that task force.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>In order to participate in the NFIP, communities are required to adoptfloodplain management regulations that either meet or exceed minimum criteriaestablished by the FEMA. These criteria generally require that residentialstructures including manufactured homes have their lowest floors elevatedto or above the 100-year or base flood elevation. In NFIP rule revisionswhich became effective on December 31, 1976, a special exception was madeto allow for the new placement, replacement, or substantial improvementof manufactured homes in existing manufactured home parks and subdivisionswithout meeting this general elevation requirement. Existing manufacturedhome parks and subdivisions are those for which the infrastructure servicingthe individual manufactured home sites was in place prior to the adoptionof floodplain management regulations by a community. This provision hascommonly been referred to as the ``grandfathering'' of existing manufacturedhome parks and subdivisions. In the early 1980's, Interagency Hazard Mitigation Teams, chaired by FEMAand mobilized after a Presidentially declared flood disaster, began identifyinginstances where existing manufactured home parks were being destroyed orextensively damaged by floods. A number of these teams, when confrontedwith the severity of these damages, specifically recommended that FEMAor the local unit of government amend its floodplain management regulationsto end the ``grandfathering'' of these manufactured home parks to preventfuture reoccurrences of this damage. On December 13, 1982, an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (47 FR 55752) which, in part, requested commentson actions that FEMA could take to remove distinctions in NFIP regulationsbetween the treatment of manufactured homes and that of other forms ofhousing. Generally, the comments received in response to this notice favoredsuch an action. In September of 1985, FEMA published a manual entitled``Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas''. As a result ofthe research that was conducted in the preparation of this manual, FEMAconcluded that it was feasible to properly elevate manufactured homes undermost conditions even in the narrow confines of an existing manufacturedhome park or subdivision. Based on recommendations from the Hazard Mitigation Teams, the resultsof its research on manufactured home installation, comments received inresponse to the ANPR, and other information available at the time, FEMAproceeded with a series of comprehensive revisions to NFIP criteria applyingto manufactured homes. Revisions replacing specific tie-down and installationstandards with general performance standards became effective on January1, 1986. On March 28, 1986, FEMA published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 10742) which would (1) substitute theterm ``manufactured home'' in place of ``mobile home'', (2) define ``manufacturedhome'' to include for floodplain management purposes certain recreationalvehicles, (3) remove prohibitions on the placement of manufactured homesin floodways and coastal high hazard areas (V-zones), and (4) require theelevation of manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in existingmanufactured home parks and subdivisions. The overall effect of these revisionswould have been to remove nearly all distinctions in NFIP criteria betweenthe requirements that applied to manufactured homes and those which appliedto conventional housing. Although copies of the proposed rule were sentto over 17,000 participating communities, only a few comments were received.The few comments from the manufactured home community supported most ofthe changes, but expressed some concern over the end of ``grandfathering''of existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions. A final rule wasthen published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 30290) which became effective on October1, 1986. This final rule is referred to in this discussion as the October1, 1986 rule revision.As communities began incorporating the October 1, 1986 rule revision intotheir local floodplain management regulations, owners of existing manufacturedhome parks and of individual manufactured homes became more aware of theelevation requirements. Associations representing the manufactured homecommunity requested that FEMA suspend that portion of the rule revisionand to provide additional opportunities for comment and analysis of theimpacts of such a requirement. FEMA suspended the provision in a June 30, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. The notice also requested comments onthe impacts of the October 1, 1986 rule revision and on possible alternativeactions that would reduce flood damages, but minimize the impacts of thoseregulations. On July 11, 1987, the Supplemental Appropriations Act (Pub.L. 100-71) was signed into law, suspending the provision through September30, 1988 to allow sufficient time for readdressing this issue. FEMA subsequentlyextended the suspension through July 30, 1989 (53 FR 25332, July 6, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">FEMA's Report on Existing Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions</ITAG>Based on its review of the 1,407 comment letters that were submitted tothe Rules Docket established for the June 30, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice and independent studies of the issue,FEMA completed a report in September of 1988 entitled ``National FloodInsurance Program: Existing Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions''for the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on HUD-IndependentAgencies. The report included: (1) An analysis of the impacts of floodingon existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions, (2) an analysis ofthe impacts of requiring elevation to or above the base flood elevationof all manufactured homes placed therein, and (3) an examination of alternativesto the October 1, 1986 rule revision. The report estimated that there were approximately $500 million in floodlosses to manufactured homes and their contents over the 10 year periodfrom 1978 through 1987. Approximately $250 million of this damage can beattributed to manufactured homes located in existing manufactured homeparks and subdivisions. Federal costs associated with these losses included$29.7 million in flood insurance claims payments and approximately $100million in disaster assistance including providing Temporary Housing forflood victims, Individual and Family Grants, and Small Business Administration(SBA) disaster loans. Other Federal costs such as defaults on Federallyguaranteed or insured loans on these manufactured homes due to flood damages,the Federal share of constructing flood control projects, lost revenuesas a result of casualty loss deductions on Federal income taxes, disasterassistance for the repair of related public infrastructure, and publicexpenditures for rescue efforts and flood fighting could not be quantified,but are believed to be significant. The report further stated that, despite the availability of flood insurancefrom the NFIP and private insurers and disaster assistance, a major portionof the cost of these flood losses will be borne by the owners and residentsof existing manufactured home parks. Costs to owners of existing manufacturedhome parks include the repair of damages to roads, utilities, manufacturedhome pads, landscaping and support buildings and the loss of income fromthe affected sites until they can be repaired and rented. The report concludesthat owners and occupants of individual manufactured homes are not likelyto be fully reimbursed for their flood losses even if the manufacturedhomes and their contents are insured through the NFIP or a private insurerof manufactured homes. Those who are not insured are dependent on disasterassistance programs which are likely to reimburse them for only a smallpercentage of their loss. Of particular concern are retired persons onfixed incomes and other low income persons who often live in manufacturedhomes who are less likely than the population as a whole to be able tofully recover financially from serious flood losses. More importantly, the report determines that there are significant publicsafety concerns that must be addressed. Although in coastal areas subjectto hurricanes most residents are normally evacuated upon the issuance ofa hurricane warning, this is not always possible for flooding that occursalong rivers and streams. FEMA identified a number of instances where liveswere lost as a result of the flooding of existing manufactured home parks.In similar situations loss of life was avoided only through the heroicactions of emergency management personnel who placed their own lives injeopardy. The report also analyzed the economic impacts on owners and residents ofexisting manufactured home parks and subdivisions that would result ifthe October 1, 1986 rule revision requiring that the lowest floor of manufacturedhomes be at or above the 100-year or base flood elevation was implemented.The report concluded that there were approximately 40,000 sites in existingmanufactured home parks and subdivisions that were subject to moderateor deep flooding (flood depths of greater than 3 feet) that could potentiallybe affected by the elevation requirement. Elevating these manufacturedhomes would generally require use of foundation systems other than standardmanufactured home installations. FEMA estimates that the elevation requirementwould apply to approximately 8 percent of these sites in any given year.Costs of elevating these manufactured homes would range from $400 to $8,000in addition to the costs of a standard installation depending on the depthof flooding at the site and the elevation technique used. Approximately126,000 additional sites are located in flood hazard areas, but are subjectto shallow flooding (flood depths of 3 feet or less). These sites wouldnot be affected since elevation requirements could be met using standardmanufactured home installations. Discussed in FEMA's report for Congress are the concerns expressed by representativesof the manufactured home community who believe that, for a number of reasons,it is not practicable to require elevation to or above the base flood elevationof manufactured homes placed in existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions.These persons believe that requiring elevation would ultimately lead tothe closure of many of these parks and subsequent loss of affordable housing.Rather than meet elevation requirements, they believe that manufacturedhome owners would choose to locate on manufactured home park sites outsideof the floodplain if available. This reluctance to elevate would be dueto aesthetics, practical difficulties in elevating manufactured homes inthe narrow confines of many existing parks, the reluctance of many persons,particularly the elderly, to climb stairs, and the added cost of an elevatedmanufactured home installation given the low incomes of many manufacturedhome owners. FEMA notes that most of these same arguments were raised inopposition to elevation requirements for other types of residential constructionduring the initial years of the NFIP. Since that time the housing industryand the general public have adapted to the elevation requirement and ithas become an accepted and prudent construction practice.However, one important way in which manufactured home parks are uniquefrom other forms of residential construction is the split in ownershipbetween the lot and the manufactured home. Renters of sites are reluctantto make substantial capital investments in the site due to their uncertaintenure, particularly since the value of any improvements would accrue tothe owner of the manufactured home park and not the manufactured home owner.Manufactured home park owners have indicated that they are reluctant tomake this capital investment due to the added cost for upgrading sites,costs that they do not believe can be passed on to tenants through rentincreases. In addition, they anticipate resistance by prospective tenantsto living in elevated manufactured homes and opposition from current tenantsto elevating manufactured homes on neighboring sites. While many existing manufactured home parks will have only a few sitesaffected or will be able to otherwise adjust to such a requirement, somemanufactured home parks would be severely impacted if elevation continuedto be required. These parks would include those with a high percentageof sites subject to moderate or deep flooding, a high rate of turnoverof sites, a high percentage of sites currently vacant, high debt servicingcosts in relation to rental income generated, no alternative locationsfor manufactured home sites on the property, and/or no alternative economicuses of the land. The timing of the impacts would vary since the requirementis not retroactive and would only apply as sites became vacant. Existingmanufactured home parks with low turnover rates might remain profitablefor many years even if they were subject to moderate or deep flooding.For other existing manufactured home parks, the owner would have to choosewhether to upgrade a site when it becomes vacant, relocate the site toelsewhere on the property, or leave the site vacant and forego the rentalincome. Ultimately, in extreme cases where the decision is made to leave all ormost sites vacant, rental income eventually would become insufficient topay for debt servicing and operation costs while still providing a profitto the owner. At this point the park would likely be closed and either(1) sold for operation with fewer sites, (2) converted to another use whichwould generate higher income, or (3) allowed to go into foreclosure. Whenthis occurs, the renters of individual sites would have to relocate toa different manufactured home park at a cost of several thousands of dollars,provided that a suitable vacant site could be found. This future uncertaintylikely would be reflected in lowered property values of both the manufacturedhome park and individual manufactured homes many years prior to actualclosure. FEMA believes that a relatively small number of otherwise economicallyhealthy manufactured home parks would actually have closed if elevationrequirements continued to be in effect. Many existing manufactured homeparks are subject to shallow flooding or have only a few sites subjectto moderate or deep flooding. In addition, there are ways individual existingmanufactured home parks could have adapted to an elevation requirement.However, the report indicated that this possible outcome was of sufficientconcern to warrant the consideration of alternatives that would minimizethese occurrences or provide additional opportunities for owners of existingmanufactured home parks to adjust to an elevation requirement. The onlyway to fully protect the economic interests of the owners of existing manufacturedhome parks and of individual manufactured homes currently located in theseparks would be to continue the ``grandfathering''. To do so would jeopardizethe lives and property of prospective residents of the park who are notcurrently at risk. In an effort to balance these conflicting concerns, FEMA developed a selectedalternative outlined in the report for Congress. This selected alternativewas designed to reduce the economic impacts on the owners and residentsof existing manufactured homes, yet still achieve the NFIP objectives ofreducing flood damages and threats to public safety. The selected alternativein FEMA's report includes the following components: 1. All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on a site inan existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufacturedhome had been substantially damaged by a flood would be required to beelevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home was at or abovethe 100-year or base flood elevation. These sites tend to be those subjectto the severest and most frequent flood conditions. 2. After a ten year period ending on October 1, 1999, all remaining sitesin existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions would also becomesubject to the elevation requirement. The substantial damage requirementin item l and natural attrition during this period would significantlyreduce the numbers of sites affected and, thus, the severity of any impacts.3. The definition of ``manufactured home'' would be revised to allow communitiesthe option of excluding a recreational vehicle from the definition andthe application of floodplain management requirements if the vehicle isfully licensed and ready for highway use. 4. A requirement previously at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(9) that emergency evacuationplans be established by communities to assure that the residents of manufacturedhome parks and subdivisions are evacuated to safe areas after a flood warningwould be restored. 5. Maximum use would be made of the proposed NFIP Community Rating Systemto encourage a variety of actions by communities to address the problem.Subsequent to the completion of the report, FEMA met with a task forceorganized and chaired by the National Manufactured Housing Federation (NMHF).Also included on the task force were representatives of the ManufacturedHousing Institute, two manufactured home owners associations, and the Associationof State Floodplain Managers, a private insurer of manufactured homes,and a local official. This task force met in November of 1988 and Februaryof 1989 to discuss the impacts of various alternatives and develop recommendationssubmitted to FEMA for consideration.The NMHF task force adopted the following recommendations by majority vote:1. In V-zones and floodways, items 1 and 2 of the selected alternativein FEMA's report should be applied to sites in existing manufactured homeparks and subdivisions. In addition, FEMA should encourage local governmentsto use block grants and other measures to relocate sites and manufacturedhomes from these areas. 2. Outside of V-zones and floodways, items 1 and 2 of the selected alternativein FEMA's report should be applied to sites in existing manufactured homeparks which can comply using a standard installation (36 inch load bearingpiers). 3. Outside of V-zones and floodways, manufactured homes placed in existingmanufactured home parks which cannot meet the base flood elevation requirementusing the 36 inch pier should at a minimum still be elevated on the 36inch pier to reduce the frequency of flood damages. (The recommendationdid not specify whether this was to be implemented immediately or throughitems 1 and 2 of the selected alternative.) 4. The severity of the flood hazard should be fully disclosed to ownersof manufactured homes who rent sites in designated floodplains. 5. FEMA should encourage escrowing or payment plans to make flood insuranceaffordable to low income manufactured home owners. 6. The word ``internal'' should be deleted from that portion of the definitionof ``manufactured home'' in FEMA's report dealing with ``recreational vehicle''jacking systems. 7. The impacts of the adopted regulations should be reevaluated in 1999.The task force members representing the manufactured home community generallybelieved that the elevation of a manufactured home higher than on a standardinstallation was not practicable due to the attitudes of manufactured homeowners who rent sites and the problems related to the split ownership ofthe manufactured home and the site. They also believed that ending the``grandfathering'' in 10 years as provided for in the selected alternativein FEMA's report would have immediate severe adverse economic impacts onthe manufactured home park owners and on owners of manufactured homes currentlyin those parks. This provision introduces a high degree of uncertaintyinto the future of some manufactured home parks and may preclude the financingor refinancing of the park itself as well as the financing of individualmanufactured homes on sites therein. As evidenced by their recommendations,these task force members were willing to concede that these impacts mightbe acceptable in readily identifiable high hazard areas such as in V-zonesand floodways. This set of recommendations was not fully supported by therepresentatives of the Association of State Floodplain Managers that wereon the task force. <ITAG tagnum="84">Requirements for Existing Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions</ITAG>FEMA has developed provisions for this proposed rule which combine portionsof both the selected alternative in FEMA's report to Congress and the NMHFtask force recommendations. FEMA believes that this approach will minimizeadverse economic impacts on the manufactured home community while at thesame time substantially achieving the NFIP objectives of reducing lossesof life and property due to flooding. For existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions, the proposed rulecontains three basic provisions. First, communities would be required todevelop or have developed evacuation plans for residents of existing manufacturedhome parks and subdivisions. Second, manufactured homes placed or substantiallyimproved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivisionon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the resultof a flood would be required to be elevated to or above the base floodelevation. Third, all other manufactured homes placed or substantiallyimproved in these existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions wouldhave to be elevated on reinforced piers or other foundation elements thatare no less than 36 inches in height above grade or have their lowest floorat or above the base flood elevation if this allows for the use of a lowerfoundation. In support of these requirements, definitions of ``existing manufacturedhome park or subdivision'', ``expansion to an existing manufactured homepark or subdivision'', and ``new manufactured home park or subdivision''would be permanently added to 44 CFR 59.1. These definitions are the sameas are currently in effect under the suspension notice published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4> on June 30, 1987 (52 FR 24370). They closelyparallel those definitions used to implement the ``grandfathering'' ofan ``existing mobile home park or mobile home subdivision'' in NFIP criteriathat were in effect prior to the October l, 1986 rule revision. ``Existingmanufactured home park or subdivision'' continues to be defined as a manufacturedhome park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicingthe lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed are completedprior to the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adoptedby the community. The first of the three basic provisions of the proposed rule would requirethat a plan for evacuating the residents of existing manufactured homeparks or subdivisions be developed and filed with and approved by appropriatecommunity emergency management authorities. The purpose of this requirementis to reduce the potential for loss of life if existing manufactured homeparks or subdivisions are flooded. This requirement was included in theregulations prior to October 1, 1986, but was dropped to simplify the regulationssince it was assumed that, as a result of ending the ``grandfathering''of existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions, the need for therequirement would be reduced as elevation requirements were applied. However,if placement of manufactured homes in existing manufactured home parksis to be permitted without elevation to or above the base flood level,this places additional persons at risk and evacuation plans must againbe required. These plans could be developed by the community as a component of an overallemergency plan or required of individual park owners. The complexity ofthe plan would be dependent on the severity of the flood hazard and theamount of warning time available. The purpose of this plan is to ensurethe safe evacuation of people and not the manufactured homes themselves.The removal of individual manufactured homes from an existing manufacturedhome park or subdivision after a flood warning is seldom feasible and sometimesdangerous.The second, and, from the standpoint of reducing future flood losses, mostimportant of the basic provisions in this proposed rule, is the revisedrequirement at 44 CFR 60.3(c)(6) that manufactured homes be elevated sothat their lowest floors are at or above the base flood elevation whenplaced on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision wherea manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.Paragraph (c)(6) would also require elevation of manufactured homes placedor substantially improved on sites outside of a manufactured home parkor subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision or in anexpansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. These siteswere subject to the elevation requirement prior to the October 1, 1986rule revision. Note that the proposed rule does not apply the elevation requirement tomanufactured homes placed in existing manufactured home parks or subdivisionswhere the repair, reconstruction, or improvement of the streets, utilities,and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilitiesand pads prior to the repair, reconstruction or improvement. This provisionwas contained in the regulations prior to the October 1, 1986 and in theJune 30, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> suspension notice. The provision would no longerbe required if the concept of ``substantial damage'' is to be applied toindividual sites. The term ``substantial damage'' is defined in a proposed rule which FEMApublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 7, 1989 (54 FR 9523). ``Substantialdamage'' means damage sustained by a structure (in this case a manufacturedhome) whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damagedcondition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structurebefore the damage occurred. Note that due to a variety of reasons evidentin the following paragraph, this provision would apply only to substantialdamage due to flood and not to other causes such as a fire or wind. Inorder to implement this provision, the community would have to determinethose sites in existing manufactured home parks where, subsequent to theinclusion of the requirement in their floodplain management regulations,manufactured homes have incurred substantial damage due to a flood. Whenpermits are issued for the placement or substantial improvement of a manufacturedhome on one of these sites, elevation of the lowest floor of the manufacturedhome to or above the base flood elevation would be required. Once a manufactured home has been destroyed or sustained major damage dueto a flood on a particular site, there is no justification to further delayimposition of an elevation requirement on that site. As stated in the reportto Congress, the post-flood period is an ideal time to upgrade or relocatesites for a variety of reasons, including: (1) These sites will tend toinclude those subject to the most severe and frequent flooding, (2) theavailability of disaster assistance and flood insurance claims paymentswill ease the financial impacts on owners of manufactured homes, (3) sitesaffected will tend to be contiguous, allowing use of elevation techniquessuch as fill or relocation of sites while minimizing impacts on adjoiningsites, (4) flooded sites are likely to remain vacant for a period of timeunless they are upgraded resulting in loss of rental income to the parkowner, (5) costly repairs to park infrastructure will be necessary makingit more attractive to relocate these sites out of the floodplain wherepossible or to abandon them, (6) conversion of the park to alternativeuses will often be possible at this time, (7) owners of individual manufacturedhomes will have lost their homes and will generally want to move to a floodfreesite, and (8) there will be a great deal of local support for solving theproblem since the severity of the hazard will be clearly evident. FEMA now believes that there is sufficient validity to the arguments raisedby the manufactured home community against its proposal to end the remaining``grandfathering'' of existing manufactured home parks and subdivisionson October 1, 1999 to warrant an alternative action. This proposed ruledoes not include such a provision. However, FEMA continues to believe thatrequiring elevation of manufactured homes to or above the base flood elevationis the only way to ensure that potential flood losses and threats to publicsafety are significantly reduced in these existing manufactured home parksand subdivisions. However, as an alternative, the third basic provisionin the proposed rule requires that manufactured homes that are placed orsubstantially improved (for other than substantial damage due to a flood)on sites in existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions are elevatedso that the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piersor other foundation elements that are no less than 36 inches in heightabove the grade at the site. A lower foundation system could be used ifthe lowest floor of the manufactured home would be at or above the baseflood elevation using such a foundation. The 36 inch pier is the maximum height that a number of States allow withoutuse of an ``engineered'' foundation at significantly greater cost. Theconcept of requiring use of at least a 36 inch pier was suggested by thetask force chaired by the National Manufactured Housing Federation. FEMAhas modified the task force recommendation by requiring use of 36 inchreinforced piers or other foundation elements immediately upon amendmentof the local floodplain management regulations subsequent to this rulebecoming final. By requiring, at a minimum, a 36 inch reinforced pier or other foundationsystem, additional flood protection can be achieved with minimal impactson the owners of manufactured homes or of existing manufactured home parks.This should result in a reduction of flood losses and the resulting floodinsurance claims payments and disaster assistance costs. The 36 inch reinforcedpier combined with the height of a manufactured home chassis and floorsystem would place the top of the manufactured home floor between fourand one half and five feet above the lowest grade at the site. This wouldbe sufficient to protect the estimated 75 percent of manufactured homesthat are subject to shallow flooding from inundation damage due to thebase or 100 year flood, provided that the reinforced pier or other foundationsystem was designed to withstand the forces of moving floodwaters and theimpact of debris carried by those floodwaters. In addition, the 36 inchreinforced pier or other foundation would reduce the frequency of floodingof those manufactured homes on sites subject to greater depths of flooding.If the use of the 36 inch pier or other foundation is not required, itis likely that many manufactured homes would continue to be placed at lowerelevations despite the fact that elevation on the 36 inch pier was practicableand could be done at minimal or no additional cost. All manufactured homes placed in flood hazard areas must be securely anchoredto an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse,or lateral movement. If piers are to be used to elevate manufactured homes,they must be reinforced. For flood hazard areas subject to velocity floodwatersor impact by debris, the lateral forces on the foundation and the manufacturedhome would generally be in excess of those that can be withstood usingstacked concrete blocks and over-the-top or frame ties. The proposed rule also adds a provision at 44 CFR 60.3(e)(8) that clarifieswhich requirements would apply in Coastal High Hazard Areas (V-zones).This provision states that manufactured homes placed or substantially improvedoutside of manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in new manufacturedhome parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured homeparks or subdivisions, and on sites in existing manufactured home parksand subdivisions on which a manufactured home has incurred substantialdamage as a result of a flood, are subject to the construction requirementsapplicable to all other V-zone structures.Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved (for reasons otherthan from substantial damage due to a flood) on other sites in existingmanufactured home parks and subdivisions in V-zones would have to meetthe proposed requirement at paragraph (c)(12) which provides for use ofthe 36 inch reinforced pier or other foundation system. It should be notedthat use of a reinforced 36 inch pier in a V-zone may be adequate to protectthe manufactured home from damage due to sheet flow in small coastal storms.However, these manufactured home installations will not withstand the waveimpacts that would be encountered in V-zones during major coastal storms.The only way to protect a manufactured home located in a V-zone from severedamage due to wave impact during a major coastal storm is to meet the constructionrequirements applicable to all other V-zone structures. Note that 44 CFR 60.3 (c)(6) and (c)(12) do not apply to Zone AO (an areaof shallow flooding with flood depths of 3 feet or less with no clearlydefined channel). Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved inZone AO must meet the same standards as other residential structures andhave their lowest floor elevated above the highest adjacent grade at leastas high as the depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).Existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions located in Zone AO werenot previously ``grandfathered'', since elevation at least as high as thedepth number could be accomplished by using a standard manufactured homeinstallation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Requirements To Be Applied to Recreational Vehicles </ITAG>The October 1, 1986 rule revision defined ``manufactured home'' to include,for floodplain management purposes, ``park trailers, travel trailers, andother similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutivedays''. For insurance purposes, park trailers, travel trailers, and othersimilar vehicles were not included. This meant that once one of these vehiclesremained on a site for more than 180 consecutive days it became a ``manufacturedhome'' and was subject to all the applicable floodplain management requirementsincluding requirements for (1) obtaining a permit in accordance with 44CFR 60.3(b)(2), (2) elevating and anchoring the vehicle to resist floatationcollapse and lateral movement in accordance with 44 CFR 60.3(b)(8), and(3) elevating the vehicle so that its lowest floor is at or above the baseflood elevation in accordance with 44 CFR 60.3(c)(6). The supplementary information in the proposed rule explained the intentof this definition change:<ITAG tagnum="21">The intent of this provision is to include these vehicles when theyare permanently left on a site and their usage and risk is the same asa ``manufactured home'', but not include them when they are placed on sitesonly seasonally or used only for camping and other short term occupancies.</ITAG>The specific problems that FEMA intended to address by defining certainrecreational vehicles to be manufactured homes were two-fold. First, olderrecreational vehicles are often taken off their wheels and placed on blocksand used as weekend ``cottages'', hunting or fishing camps, or for similaruses. The second problem has arisen with the recent development of thepark trailer and the growth in size of the travel trailer. In some geographicalareas, recreational vehicle resorts, travel trailer parks, and campgroundshave been established within which sites are sold or rented for long periodsof time. Park trailers and larger travel trailers were located in theserecreational vehicle resorts, travel trailer parks and campgrounds. Overtime stick-built additions such as ``Florida rooms'' and other living areasand garages, carports, and sun shades were added to these units and manyevolved into seasonal and, in a few instances, year-round housing. Although FEMA does not currently insure these structures, their use andrisk are no different from a manufactured home or conventional house and,as such, they should be subject to the same floodplain management standardsas other forms of residential construction. At the time FEMA developedthe rule revision that became effective October 1, 1986, it believed thatthe use of the ``180 consecutive day'' criteria would cause less disruptionin the operation of most travel trailer parks or campgrounds than any alternativecourse of action. It was anticipated that the recreational vehicle wouldbe periodically moved to avoid meeting the definition of ``manufacturedhome'' and becoming subject to ``manufactured home'' requirements. By ensuringthat recreational vehicles placed in flood hazard areas were periodicallymoved, FEMA would prevent those recreational vehicles from being permanentlyplaced on a site and evolving into seasonal or year-round housing. Thiswould minimize the investment at risk and insure that, if a flood did occur,no individuals would lose their primary residence and become eligible fordisaster assistance. Several of those who commented in response to the June 30, 1987 <T4>Federal Register </T4>expressed concerns that, by including certainpark trailers, travel trailers, and similar vehicles in the definitionof ``manufactured home'', FEMA was improperly equating recreational vehicleswith manufactured homes and made the point that the former were not builtto industry standards for manufactured homes and were not intended as primaryresidences. FEMA included these recreational vehicles in the definitionof ``manufactured home'' solely to avoid unnecessary complexity in NFIPcriteria and not to imply that they were in any way built to manufacturedhome standards. It does not believe that the approach is inconsistent withthe Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 asindicated in some of those comments. However, a more serious problem was subsequently brought to FEMA's attentionby local officials. FEMA believed that the provision including recreationalvehicles in the definition of manufactured home only if they were placedon a site for more than 180 consecutive days would be relatively simplefor local officials to administer. However, this has not always been thecase, particularly for condominium or long term lease campgrounds, traveltrailer parks, and recreational vehicle resorts which are becoming increasinglycommon. Because the owner of the recreational vehicle either owns the siteor has a year or longer lease on that site, the management of the campground,travel trailer park or resort does not keep records of the movements ofthat individual recreational vehicle. It is difficult for local officialsin these communities to ensure that these recreational vehicles are infact moved and have not remained on the site for more than the 180 consecutivedays.FEMA proposes to address these concerns as part of an overall effort toclarify the requirements applicable to recreational vehicles. FEMA proposesto add a separate definition of ``recreational vehicle'' which will beconsistent with the definition in U.S. Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment regulations and to include separate floodplain management requirementsfor ``recreational vehicles'' at 44 CFR 60.3(c)(14). Under the proposed rule, no floodplain management regulations would applyto a recreational vehicle if the recreational vehicle was on site for lessthan 180 consecutive days or was fully licenced and ready for highway use.``Ready for highway use'' means that the recreational vehicle is on itswheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnecttype utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.If the recreational vehicle did not meet either of these criteria, therecreational vehicle would be subject to the permitting requirement inandSection; 60.3(b)(1) and the elevation and anchoring requirements in andSection;60.3(c)(6). There are no provisions for ``grandfathering'' recreational vehicle sites.These sites can continue to be used by recreational vehicles which are``fully licenced and ready for highway use''. Those recreational vehicleswhich are currently on sites and which are not ``fully licenced and readyfor highway use'' would not be subject to these requirements unless theywere substantially improved or replaced by another recreational vehicle.When a recreational vehicle is removed from the site for whatever reason,the owner of the campground, travel trailer park, recreational vehicleresort or individual site will have the option of either meeting the floodplainmanagement requirements with any replacement recreational vehicle or ensuringthat such a vehicle remained fully licensed and highway ready. The latteralternative is not inconsistent with the manner in which most travel trailerparks or recreational vehicle resorts are traditionally operated and shouldpose no hardship to the owner or operator of that facility. An additional reason for not ``grandfathering'' recreational vehicle sitesis that nearly all recreational vehicle resorts, travel trailer parks andcampgrounds were initially established to serve a transient clientele andonly later evolved into permanent placements of individual recreationalvehicles on sites. It would not be possible to develop a simple set ofcriteria for ``grandfathering'' individual recreational vehicle sites.FEMA believes that the advantage of this approach is that the local buildingofficial should be able to drive by or through a campground, travel park,or recreational vehicle resort periodically and verify that all vehiclesin a campground are recreational vehicles. FEMA intends to provide the community with the option of either using the``180 day'' criteria or the ``fully licensed and ready for highway use''criteria since either would achieve the intended purpose. Many communitiesalready place limitations on how long a recreational vehicle can be lefton a site for reasons other than floodplain management. Other communitiesare located in areas where, due to climate, possible vandalism, or otherreasons, recreational vehicles are seldom left on a site over the winter.These communities have already adopted the ``180 day'' criteria or itsequivalent and can administer the provision without difficulty. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Actions </ITAG>For the purpose of flood insurance rating, all manufactured homes placedor substantially improved in existing manufactured home parks and subdivisionswill continue to be treated as Pre-FIRM structures and eligible for Pre-FIRMrates. This will apply even on those sites where a manufactured home hasbeen substantially damaged and where elevation to or above the base floodelevation is required for subsequent placements and substantial improvementsof manufactured homes. The reason for continuing to make insurance availableat Pre-FIRM rates is the practical difficulty for insurance agents in identifyingwhich sites are subject to an elevation requirement and which are not.However, applicants for flood insurance on these manufactured homes willhave the option of submitting an elevation certificate and being ratedbased on the elevation of the manufactured home if this would result ina lower rate. FEMA encourages participating communities to work with and assist the ownersand residents of existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions in theircommunity to upgrade their parks to minimize flood damages and threatsto public safety. In many communities, these existing manufactured homeparks constitute a critical housing resource for low and moderate incomepersons that may be difficult to replace if severely damaged due to flooding.Communities should consider waiving other planning and zoning requirementsif this will allow relocation of the most hazardous and frequently floodedsites to flood-free or less hazardous locations or the upgrading of sitesto minimize flood damages. There may be situations where public financialassistance in these efforts is in the best interests of all concerned.FEMA intends to make use of the proposed NFIP Community Rating System toencourage action by communities to reduce damages to and impacts on ownersand residents of existing manufactured home parks. Under this CommunityRating System, flood insurance premiums would be reduced in those communitieswhich undertake actions to reduce flood losses above and beyond the minimumactions required for participation in the NFIP. The reductions in floodinsurance premium would reflect the decreased risk and exposure to lossesto the program that would result from these actions. In addition to recognizingmore restrictive regulations adopted by a community, the Community RatingSystem would provide credit for actions such as full disclosure requirementsfor prospective park tenants, developing emergency flood-fighting plans,and actions to assist manufactured home park owners in upgrading or relocatingflood-prone sites or otherwise reducing flood damages. FEMA has decided not to include in this proposed rule the National ManufacturedHousing Federation task force recommendation that there should be a disclosurerequirement for manufactured homes placed in existing manufactured homeparks in flood hazard areas. The NFIP will continue to depend on the permitrequirement for placements of manufactured homes and the notificationsrequired under the mandatory purchase provisions in the Flood DisasterProtection Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4002, <T3>et seq.</T3>), to disclose flood hazards. Historically, FEMA has encouraged,but not required, the adoption of these disclosure requirements by Stateor local governments. Disclosure requirements are currently a recommendationfor communities in 44 CFR 60.22 Planning Considerations for FloodproneAreas and will be credited under the Community Rating System. The task force also recommended that the NFIP should explore encouragingthe more widespread use of escrowing for flood insurance premiums and establishingpayment plans to make flood insurance affordable to the owners of manufacturedhomes. The task force believed that this would encourage the purchase offlood insurance by these persons. FEMA does recommend that lenders escrowfunds for payment of flood insurance premiums. This practice provides ameans for lenders to ensure that flood insurance coverage is maintainedon properties subject to the mandatory purchase requirement in the FloodDisaster Protection Act of l973. However, FEMA has no authority to requireescrowing. Action would have to be taken by the Federal instrumentalitieswhich regulate the various categories of lenders.In regard to payment plans, FEMA's concern has been that the risk of floodingis highly seasonal in many types of floodplains and in many areas of thenation. It would be possible that persons would obtain flood insuranceand then stop making payments after the season with the severest floodhazard had passed. FEMA will have to study further to determine whetherthe gain in additional policies in effect that result from the use of paymentplans would be sufficient to counterbalance this potential loss of premiumincome.Finally, the task force chaired by the National Manufactured Home Federationrecommended that the issues related to existing manufactured home parksand subdivisions should be reevaluated at the end of 10 years. The taskforce felt that the problem should be given the opportunity to solve itselfthrough attrition and that further actions may be unnecessary. FEMA agreesthat this type of review is necessary, particularly since, under the proposedrule, limited ``grandfathering'' of existing manufactured home parks andsubdivisions will continue. If at the end of l0 years, a reevaluation indicatesthat the regulatory requirements in this proposed rule and the naturalattrition of older existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions havesubstantially reduced the number of sites at risk and the attendant floodlosses, no additional actions by FEMA would be necessary. However, if floodlosses, government costs, and threats to public safety are not reducedsignificantly, there may be a need to review other alternatives. Impacts on Community Ordinances It is important to emphasize that NFIP criteria are minimum standards thatcommunities must meet in order to participate in the program. The criteriado not preempt State or community authority to adopt more restrictive requirementsif they so choose. This is provided for at 44 CFR 60.1(d) which specificallystates that more restrictive State and local regulations take precedenceover NFIP criteria. Note that no matter what actions FEMA takes regardingexisting manufactured home parks and subdivisions, some States and manycommunities are likely to continue to require standards equivalent to thosein the October l, 1986 rule revision. Any community which adopted and currently has in force the October 1, 1986elevation requirement will already be compliant as will communities inthose States which require elevation of all manufactured homes. These communitieswill have the option of incorporating the final rule into their ordinances.In addition, communities which do not have existing manufactured home parkswill be considered compliant regardless of the language in their ordinancesince the ``grandfather'' provision would have no practical effect. Ordinancerevisions would be required by FEMA for those communities that both (1)have existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions and (2) have retainedor amended their ordinances to reincorporate the complete ``grandfathering''.FEMA has determined, based upon an Environmental Assessment, that the proposedrule does not have significant impact upon the quality of the human environment.As a result, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared. Afinding of no significant impact is included in the formal docket fileand is available for public inspection and copying at the Rules DocketClerk, Office of General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency,500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472. The proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and has not undergone regulatory flexibility analysis.Note that the basis of this determination is FEMA's report ``National FloodInsurance Program: Existing Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions''which examined these potential impacts in detail. The proposed rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined in Executive Order12291, dated February 17, 1981, and hence, no regulatory analysis has beenprepared. FEMA has determined that this proposed rule does not contain a collectionof information requirement as described in section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 44 CFR Parts 59 and 60 </ITAG>Flood insurance, Flood plains.
