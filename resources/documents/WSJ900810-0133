New Zealand's government in June picked the two Baby Bellsto buy the state-owned phone company for about $2.46 billion,and the transaction is expected to be completed next month.Ameritech and Bell Atlantic immediately sought a waiver fromthe consent decree that broke up the Bell System to permitthem, through Telecom, to handle the New Zealand portion oftelecommunications traffic between the two countries.</LP><TEXT>   Among other things, the consent decree bars the Baby Bellsfrom the long-distance business. Judge Harold Greene, whooversees the decree, granted the waiver request and gave theBaby Bells permission to own minority stakes in internationalsatellite and undersea cables.   Judge Greene, however, stipulated that the companies,through Telecom, can't own more than 10% of undersea cablesor international satellite systems. He also said that Telecomcan't provide long-distance service in the U.S. or owninternational facilities, such as satellite earth stations,in the U.S.   In addition, the judge barred the two U.S. phone companiesfrom marketing Telecom's international service in the U.S.,adding that Telecom can't interconnect with Bell Atlantic'sor Ameritech's domestic networks.   In granting the waiver, Judge Greene gave the regionalBell companies more encouragement as they venture overseas.The proposed purchase of the New Zealand phone company, hesaid, &quot;constitutes a one-time opportunity to export Americantelecommunications expertise and technology.&quot; Theopportunity, he said, meshes with his policy of &quot;encouragingforeign business ventures by the regional companies wherethis can be done consistently with the decree.&quot;   At the same time, he emphasized that he wasn't consideringa blanket waiver that would permit the Baby Bells to acquire10% of any business the consent decree bars them fromentering. He said the waiver shouldn't be read as anindication that future requests to enter for overseasbusinesses will be &quot;blindly granted.&quot;   Under the agreement, two New Zealand companies,Freightways Holdings Ltd., a conglomerate, and Fay, RichwhiteHoldings Ltd., a merchant bank, initially will have acombined stake of less than 1%. The interest will grow to 10%over the next three years, while Bell Atlantic and Ameritechwill reduce their combined stake to 49.9% through a series ofstock offerings that could begin as early as next year.   MCI Communications Corp. had objected to the waiverrequest on grounds that the Bells could discriminate in theirselection of international carriers, particularly when MCI,which is also involved in a New Zealand long-distanceventure, goes into competition with Telecom of New Zealand.But while Judge Greene acknowledged that MCI may be correct,he said &quot;such local discrimination is of no legitimateconcern to the court unless it is likely to affect the U.S.segment of those calls.&quot;   An MCI spokesman said Judge Greene &quot;took into accountsatisfactorily the concerns that we had raised,&quot; citing thejudge's restrictions on ownership of international cables andsatellites and prohibition against discrimination againstU.S. international carriers.</TEXT></DOC>
