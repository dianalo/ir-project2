The body of Charles Stuart of suburban Reading was pulled fromthe harbor shortly before 1 p.m. and positively identified, saidTrooper Barbara Bennett, a State Police spokeswoman.   Stuart's wife, Carol, was fatally wounded Oct. 23 and their son,Christopher, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section as hismother lay dying, survived just 17 days after the widely publicizedshootings.   ``Basically, it's fair to say, he could not handle theallegations or statements made about him,'' Suffolk CountyProsecutor Newman Flanagan said, describing a handwritten suicidenote found in Stuart's car.   Stuart, who spent more than a month in the hospital after beingwounded in the shootings, died after he jumped off Tobin Bridgeinto Boston Harbor. It took police divers several hours to find thebody after it was originally spotted in the water by a policeofficer and a worker.   Flanagan said Stuart became a suspect Wednesday after Bostonpolice and investigators from his office interrogated severalpeople late into the night. The prosecutor said the dramatic storyStuart initially told about being attacked by an unknown robberwhile leaving the hospital ``is not true.'' He would not elaborate,or say whether Stuart was one of those who was interrogated.   Stuart, the 29-year-old manager of a fur store, had told policethat he and his wife, 30, a laywer, were leaving Brigham andWomen's Hospital in Boston after attending a birthing class when anassailant commandeered their car and forced them to drive into anadjacent neighborhood, where he robbed and shot them. Mrs. Stuart,seven months pregnant, was shot in the head, Stuart in the abdomen.   Though critically wounded, Stuart summoned help on the cartelephone. His frantic 10-minute call to police and thedispatcher's efforts to determine where the car was were broadcastnationally and prompted an outpouring of sympathy for Stuart.   No arrest warrant had been issued prior to Stuart'sdisappearance, but Flanagan said, ``I would assume he could verywell have been aware of'' having become a suspect.   Flanagan would not comment on a report by WNEV-TV that Stuartbecame the prime suspect after his brother Matthew went to policeand offered information.   A man who answered the telephone at Matthew Stuart's suburbanhome this morning said the brother was not there and no one in thefamily would comment.   After the news of Stuart's death came out, Mrs. Stuart's father,Giusto DiMaiti, was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital withan undisclosed ailment. The hospital would not discuss hiscondition.   Edward Marchand, chief of police in Charles Stuart's hometown ofReading, said Stuart's house had been watched by police overnightafter Boston police informed the suburban police that Stuart was asuspect. But Stuart never returned home.   Marchand said he believed Stuart was aware his house was beingwatched.   The shootings shocked the city and caused some racial tension;Stuart had described the attacker as a black man.   In a note read at Mrs. Stuart's funeral that Stuart had writtenin his hospital bed, he said: ``My life will be empty without you.Now you're taken away from me. I will never know the feeling ofyour hand in mine.'' Among the mourners were Gov. Michael Dukakisand Mayor Raymond Flynn.   Marchand would not say why Stuart had become a suspect, but hesaid ``there's a lot more to the story.''   Steve Aitkins of the Coast Guard said a wallet and a note werefound in Stuart's car, which was discovered parked on a lower levelof the 300-foot-high, double-decked bridge over Boston Harbor.   Shortly before Christmas, Stuart viewed a lineup containing analleged suspect, but officials and lawyers refused to say whetheran identification was made.   Asked if a man named in news reports as the alleged suspect,William Bennett, could still be suspected of being involved in theshootings, Flanagan said he was no longer a suspect.</TEXT></DOC>
