Le Coultre. I'm not name-dropping, just calling some of my six dozen clematis vines by their given names, at the same time pronouncing their genus name fearlessly: clem'-atis. (Buttressed, I admit, by a bit of doggerel devised by J.E. Spingarn, the American clematis evangelist of the 1930s:    Because it climbs on lattice,   Hoi polloi say &quot;clem-at'-is&quot;;   But Webster will not cease to hiss    Until they call it &quot;clem'-a-tis.&quot;   Aside from getting hoi polloi to say clematis aright, the American clematis maven has the problem of getting together a representative clematis climbery. By the second spring after I was first incited to clematis I discovered that the American gardener (quite unlike the English) suffers from a chronic clematis supply crisis. Clematis-wise the U.S. is underdeveloped. There is just one immense clematis factory in this country -- Steffen's -- which supplies most of the mail-order suppliers that supply you with the same half-dozen big-blossomed, beautiful clematis, year after year.    For $2 Steffen's (1259 Fairport Road, Fairport, N.Y. 14450) will send you its &quot;Clematis Handbook.&quot; Listed are 86 &quot;Large Flowering Premium Hybrids,&quot; 56 &quot;Standard Large Flowering Hybrids,&quot; and 49 &quot;Small Flowering Premium Varieties,&quot; fulsomely illustrated with dozens of blue-lavender-purple-pink-magenta perianth pix guaranteed to trigger clematis lust. What it fails to mention is that Steffen's does not deal with thee and me, and the nurseries it wholesales to are apparently too unimaginative to stock more than a large-flowered example from each color group (and hardly any of the less-is-more-charming small-flowered varieties).    Meanwhile, garden centers, if they carry clematis at all, have usually stripped them of their proper names in favor of &quot;lite-generic&quot; labels: red clematis, white clematis, blue clematis. This eliminates most clematis personalities and the fun of gossiping about, say, the Countess of Lovelace and Daniel Deronda, since most clematis go by the recycled names of their creators, their creators' inlaws or aristocratic patrons, many of whom lived in 19th-century England, France and Germany.    Family history is lost when clematis names are reduced to red, white and blue. Clematis introductions would be worse than dull without the names. I like to make them assisted by Christopher Lloydisms, &quot;mots&quot; culled from that pungent English garden writer's book &quot;Clematis.&quot; &quot;There is nothing subtle about Comtesse de Bouchaud,&quot; I quote, though King George V has &quot;a reputation for shy flowering.&quot; &quot;The blowsy old girl&quot; Mrs. Cholmondeley &quot;makes a splendid show,&quot; but Mme. Baron Veillard and Lady Betty Balfour may &quot;fail to come to the boil in colder areas.&quot;    I read Lloyd's clematis commentaries with some envy, considering all the clematis I'll likely never have the chance to bring to the boil in Brooklyn. Still, checking the behavior of those I have against Lloyd, I've been able to deduce that my own little clematis of horrors, acquired six years ago under the shrub clematis designation &quot;C. davidiana&quot; (but seeming to lack the upstanding genes for shrubdom) is in fact the sprawling clematis layabout &quot;jouiniana&quot; &quot;Praecox,&quot; a plant proficient in hostile, or at least unfeeling takeovers, and in Lloyd's opinion &quot;a poor thing.&quot; I haven't had the heart for the &quot;annual massacre&quot; Lloyd recommends, ergo jouiniana has now ramped over a couple of maples, two catalpas and a mulberry -- though at a lower level it makes a splendid ground smother.    In addition to being just plain gorgeous, clematis are useful and obliging worker plants -- draping, muffling, wrapping, decking most anything you set them to, April to December. From what look to be dead brown sticks, a clematis quickly shoots to life in late winter, scrambling up anything its leaf petioles can grab - the Philippe Petit of perennials.    Clematis are among the best of bloom impostors. Bring a clematis up through a lilac, a magnolia, and during summer it can do for spring-flowering shrubs what hybridizers cannot -- re-flower them, repeatedly, and with a tropical prodigality of bloom. Nelly Moser, Vyvyan Pennell and Edith are the festoonery on my lilac. Elsewhere, Etoile Rose, Purpurea Plena Elegans and Mrs. N. Thompson twine with the wisteria. As my first vine of defense, clematis have spared me city life with 221 feet of naked chain-link fence. The clematis-obliterated fence has long since been embowered by a purple jackmanii, a pink Hagley hybrid, a magenta Ernest Markham, a blue Perle d'Azur, among others.    A brochure that came my way recently from a big nursery in the South asked &quot;Can you name this flower?&quot; -- a large purple asterisk of six sepals with a white-mauve central boss. I could. But for the enlightenment of the clematis non-cognoscenti, the company went on to tout clematis as &quot;the best kept secret in American Gardening.&quot; Alas, the company that posed the clematis question did not exactly fire the clematis-indifferent imagination by its brief, clearly the work of an insurance underwriter. Clematis is the policy, the brochure assured, for &quot;prolonging the blooming period of your vertical coverage.&quot;    Even talk like that does not stop my clematisizing. If I could find it, I would like the clematis Texan, Sir Trevor Lawrence, to get on the fence with Cecile Brunner, my climbing polyantha sweetheart rose. I'd be delighted to have Sir Garnet Wolseley (red-flushed purple, large-flowered) raddle with the nightshade and the porcelain vine. But until some adventuresome clematis grower-seller comes along, supply problems will keep me from further diversifying my clematis climbery or extending my vertical coverage.    ---   D.S.
