 What, we wondered, is the real marketfor CD-ROMs?andP;  How are they faring in competition with other media, includingwrite-once (WORM) and erasable optical drives?andP;  We were not sure that thelittle five-inch silver disks based on audio CD technology really had afuture.andP;  However, we came away convinced that CD-ROM is indeed here for thelong term.andM;CD-ROM will survive because it has established two strong niches as a datadelivery mechanism: it can be an alternative to certain online services andreference books, and it can displace magnetic tape and floppy disks incertain data-dissemination applications.andP;  There are other application areas,but many are still speculative and none has yet developed into a realbusiness.andM;CD-ROM excels in applications that require random access to large amounts ofdata (typically, from 100 MB up to several GB).andP;  Ideally, the data is neededby hundreds or thousands of users, and in many applications it must beupdated every few weeks or months.andM;CD-ROM vs.andP;  online services and reference books.andP;  CD-ROMs are increasinglytaking over applications that were previous handled via online services ormultivolume reference books.andP;  Here are some examples:andM;* Library applications have been a major success story for CD-ROM.andP;  Inparticular, periodical indexes on CD-ROM seem likely to largely replace thecurrent printed versions.andP;  The CD-ROM versions are typically more current,much quicker to use, and, through cross-referencing, more likely to turn upuseful citations.andP;  Dedicated PCs running CD-ROM index services are already afixture in most college libraries.andP;  CD-ROMs can also satisfy some of thedemand for onlin search services.andP;  The benefits are such that justifying theCD-ROM service, including a dedicated PC and CD-ROM drive, is not difficult.andO;A half-dozen firms are thriving on this market.andM;* A related application area is consumer-oriented reference books on CD-ROM,which currently include a Grolier Encyclopedia, the Oxford EnglishDictionary, Webster's Ninth Collegiate Dictionary, and several others(including a zip code directory and the American Heritage Dictionary) bundledas the Microsoft Bookshelf.andP;  These reference-book products are addressed to amore general audience and complete more directly with paper-based publishingthan the periodical indexes and related library applications, so they arelikely to have a more difficult time in the market.andM;* Phone directories on CD-ROM are another big growth area.andP;  Some regionaldirectories have been available for months, and a national directory,SilverPlatter's DiscAmerica, has just become available.andP;  DiscAmerica offersthe names, addresses, and phone numbers of 100 million U.S.andP;  residents on twoCD-ROMs for $ 2,995.andP;  You can find the names and phone numbers of everyone ona given block, or the phone number of everyone with a specific name, eithernationwide or in specific cities or zip codes.andP;  It will be a hit with tracingand collections services, marketeers, fund-raisers and government agencies.andO;It does raise unsettling privacy issues, though.andM;* Companies with complex products are increasingly looking to CD-ROM as amethod of delivering technical manuals.andP;  The latest is Mack Trucks, which issupplying parts data on CD-ROM to 250 truck dealers.andP;  The data will occupy 15disks (3 of which are available so far), and the system to access it isleased to the dealers for $4,000 per year.andP;  The company that put together thesystem for Mack, Image Storage/Image Retrieval Systems (Langhorne, PA),demonstrated it at CD-ROM Expo.andP;  The 15 disks will replace parts catalogsoccupying 330 feet of shelf space.andM;These applications emphasize the virtues of CD-ROM: random access,gigabyte-range file size, and periodic update by complete replacement.andM;CD-ROM partisans cite the low unit cost of discs after mastering (less than$5) as a factor favoring CD-ROM over WORM and erasable optical technology.andO;But that cost is not a significant factor for these applications, since diskreplication constitutes a trivial part of the overall cost.andP;  Switching toWORM media, with a cost twenty times higher, would not change the economicsmuch.andP;  (Since no mastering is required with WORM, the economics ofreplication actually favor WORM in quantities up to a few dozen.)andP;  But CD-ROMis much more standardized, and drives are much cheaper and more widelyavailable.andP;  Those are the key factors favoring CD-ROM for these earlyapplications.andM;CD-ROM vs.andP;  mag tape and floppy disks.andP;  How can you disseminate a largedatabase, for subsequent processing on various computers?andP;  Traditionally,this has been a job for 9-track magnetic tape.andP;  Mag tape is standardized andcheap and has gigabyte-range capacity.andP;  But it is a serial medium, so randomaccess is out unless you have enough disk space to copy the entire database.andO;And mag tape drives cost at least several thousand dollars--out of range formay PC users.andP;  Floppy disks, with a maximum capacity of a megabyte or so,aren't helpful for gigabyte databases.andM;This shortcoming has created an opportunity for CD-ROM.andP;  In particular, manygovernment databases are becoming available in CD-ROM format.andP;  Theinformation comes from the Bureau of Land Management, the Census Bureau, theGeological Survey, the Library of Congress, NASA, and many other arms of thegovernment.andP;  The CD-ROMs typically cost a few hundred dollars.andP;  That makesthem attractive to PC users, who usually have neither tape drives noravailable disk space onto which data from a tape might be copied.andP;  The userneed only purchase a CD-ROM drive (and perhaps come up with some software) toget access to the data.andM;Like database applications in its economics is access to the full text ofimportant documents.andP;  In this case, the audience is people (often scholars)interested in analyzing the text or retrieving parts of it.andP;  Full text onCD-ROM is available for the Bible, the Constitution Papers, Pravda, andmasterworks of French literature, among other writings.andP;  Full text of allSupreme Court decisions is supposed to be available soon.andP;  For anyone whoneeds these sources, CD-ROM is very attractive.andM;Other CD-ROM applications that are currently enjoying success includegeographic data (there are several map, atlas, and geographic market-analysisproducts out) and image libraries (including clip-art services and stockphoto libraries).andP;  Font delivery is another possible application: at theshow, NEC announced that it would offer the entire Adobe library on a CD-ROMfor $10,000.andM;Games.andP;  So far, the potential of CD-ROM for games remains untapped.andP;  The onlyreal exception is &quot;Manhole,&quot; a marvelous interactive adventure game for theMac.andP;  It allows the player to move through a complex world by clicking themouse on various items on the screen.andP;  The game, which is constructed inHyperCard, has hundreds of scenes, most containing objects that do something(open, speak, move, etc.) when they are clicked on.andM;Despite the enthusiam with which Manhole has been received, there have beenfew other CD-ROM games.andP;  But that situation could change this winter.andM;Prices.andP;  The costs of mastering CD-ROMs and of buying drives have beenfalling slowly but steadily.andP;  It is now possible to master CD-ROMs for wellunder $5,000, once you have a magnetic tape in the proper format.andO;Thereafter, individual copies cost only a few dollars.andM;Drive prices have been falling too.andP;  Currently, drives for PCs and Macsgenerally cost between $800 and $1,200.andP;  But NEC announced a $600 drive atthe Expo, and it will offer a drive with its game system (mentioned above)for just $400.andM;Sub-$500 prices are important because they will open up a new and broadermarket for CD-ROM applications.andP;  With audio CD players now available for lessthan $200 (and sometimes on sale for less than $150), it makes sense thatCD-ROM drives should drop in price.andP;  The CD-ROM drive shares most of the CDplayer's electronics and is, if anything, simpler to manufacture than theaudio version.andP;  Low sales volume is the main culprit keeping the price ofCD-ROM drives relatively high.andM;In summary, the CD-ROM Expo revealed many signs of health and growth.andP;  Mostof the successful products are in relatively small niches, but they are largeenough to ensure CD-ROM's survival, for the present at least.andP;  Perhaps, ifdrive prices continue to decline and consumer-oriented applications gainmomentum, CD-ROM will eventually move out of niches and into the mainstream.andM;Coda: Beethoven.andP;  Our favorite product from the CD-ROM Expo is not even aCD-ROM.andP;  It is a HyperCard Stack working in tandem with an audio CD, shown inthe Apple booth.andP;  The CD is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and the stack is &quot;CDCompanion,&quot; the first of a series from The Voyager Company.andP;  The stackprovides commentary about the symphony, the composer, and the era.andP;  Itillustrates the main themes via music notation highlighted in synchrony withthe music from the CD.andP;  It provides English translations of the lyrics as thesoloists sing them.andM;This product is a lot of fun, in addition to being an excellent educationaltool.andP;  It begins to deliver on what hypertext has been promising foreducation.andP;  We hope to see a lot more like it in the future.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
