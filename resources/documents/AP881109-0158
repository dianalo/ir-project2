White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the presidentdesignated his chief of staff, Kenneth N. Duberstein, to head atransition team that is expected to hold its first meeting withrepresentatives of the president-elect on Thursday.   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, planned planned a public greeting forBush and his wife, Barbara, in the Rose Garden late today, followedby a private meeting of the two men in the Oval Office to discussthe transition and other issues.   Fitzwater said Mrs. Reagan telephoned Mrs. Bush Tuesday night,shortly after Reagan called the vice president, to express her bestwishes. He said he believed Reagan also planned to callMassachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the losing Democraticpresidential candidate.   Asked whether Reagan believes he made the difference for Bush inCalifornia or other states where he campaigned, Fitzwater said, ``Ithink the president feels that he did all he could. I know he isgratified by the California victory. That was very close when wewent there.''   Aides named to serve with Duberstein on the transition team wereLt. Gen. Colin Powell, the president's national security adviser;M.B. Oglesby, his deputy chief of staff; A.B. Culvahouse, the WhiteHouse counsel, and John Tuck, director of the office of chief ofstaff.   Fitzwater said the president's Cabinet would have a breakfastwith Duberstein Thursday to discuss the transition and activitiesfor the remainder of the president's administration.   He said Reagan would have a full Cabinet meeting later in theday, at which the transition would be discussed. Also on the agendawas discussion of the final budget Reagan will submit to Congress onJan. 9.   Fitzwater said the Bush transition office would be located in3{-floors of a Washington office building with enough room for astaff of about 400. He said this would be the same size staff as forthe Reagan transition in 1980.   Congress appropriated $3.5 million for the transition.   Fitzwater said weekly planning meetings for the transition hadbeen under way since August.   After the polls closed in California late Tuesday, Reagan calledboth Bush and his running mate Dan Quayle, speaking to each for afew minutes and ``offering his congratulations to both,'' saidFitzwater.   After telephoning the victors, Reagan released a statementsaying, ``Nancy and I congratulate Gerge Bush and Dan Quayle ontheir historic victory. Their mandate will continue the changes thatcreate jobs, prosperity and peace for all Americans.''   Reagan called the contest ``a long and vigorous campaign.Governor Dukakis and Senator Bentsen represented their party withstrength and tenacity. Now we must pull together and help the vicepresident lead America into the 1990s. I look forward to workingwith George and his team on a smooth transition.''   The president and first lady spent the evening watching thereturns on television and eating a buffet supper in the privatequarters of the White House.   The couple invited Mrs. Reagan's brother, Richard Davis, hisfamily and several other friends and associates to join them,including Reagan's daughter, Maureen.   The president's pollster, Richard Wirthlin, kept the presidentcurrent on the election results throughout the day, Duberstein said.
