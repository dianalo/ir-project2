Sell them to buy a taxi.    What would a Polish taxi driver do with the above, fitted out with EGA cards, enhanced keyboards and 40MB SEAGATE hard disks?    Sell them to build a house.    Capitalist computers have become hot items for nimble Polish entrepreneurs seeking quick profits in the complicated world of embargoes, export licenses and black-market currencies. A quick computer killing takes just a few fancy steps, a bribe or two and a buyer willing to pay in Polish zlotys at triple the dollar's black-market rate.    Thus, a $2,000 computer will cost two million zlotys (the price of those dollars in the black market) and sell here for six million. The seller pays a tax of one million zlotys and comes away three million zlotys richer. It takes most Poles 10 years to make that much.    But who in Poland would be fool enough to pay three times the black-market rate for a personal computer? It would have to be a customer with a desperate desire to enter the high-tech age, plenty of zlotys and not a dollar to spare. A customer, in short, like the Polish state.    &quot;The government gets the computers free,&quot; says Marek Kaluzny, a software writer who hands out the perfumed business cards of a Taiwanese clone maker. &quot;It just prints zlotys.&quot; Its shrewder citizens then parlay that paper into more computers. Says a man who buys PCs for the state: &quot;It's big money. Everybody benefits.&quot;    This isn't quite what the industrial democracies had in mind when they embargoed high-technology exports to the Soviet bloc. Nor is it what the Soviet bloc has in mind now that it is setting out to build PCs of its own.    The U.S. has lately taken to task embargo partners who have let exotic items, like grinding machines for submarine propellers, slip through their nets. But the mass-produced PC, still theoretically under embargo controls, has proved far more slippery.    Always on the lookout for loopholes, the Poles have become the East bloc's biggest PC traders, thanks largely to the greenbacks provided by their Polish-American relatives. One Taiwan company shipped 1,500 machines to Poland in 1986. Amstrad computers from Britain account for 70% of the air freight between London and Warsaw. On Warsaw airport's import dock, close to 100 PCs pile up daily.    A Polish dealer figures that tens of thousands arrive in a year. &quot;We are talking,&quot; he says, &quot;about tens of millions of dollars.&quot; Since the boom began in 1985, PC prices have actually fallen in Poland. The cause isn't a drop in demand but a surge of supply.    Capitalist computer makers have few qualms about this. The more they sell, the better. But capitalist soldiers don't feel so rosy. Some in the Pentagon see powerful PCs, in the right numbers and in the wrong military hands, as strategic threats. To seek a military-commercial balance, the embargo partners have agreed to ease the rules. Soon they will let the East buy all the PCs it likes -- as long as they fall into the low-caliber range. Too bad the East won't want them.    The Polish state's demand already focuses on muscular machines with the power of IBM's PC AT, and these machines will still need export approval. The U.S. is pressuring Asian clone makers to screen such shipments. But West Europeans screen them now, and the computers leak eastward anyway. In countries like Britain, it seems, enforcers don't know or don't care that Poles who buy PCs ostensibly for private use pool them through middlemen in Poland for sale to the state, the army possibly included.    &quot;Obviously, that bypasses the rules,&quot; Paul Freedenberg says when told on the phone how the operation works. As the Commerce Department's acting undersecretary for export administration, he is America's embargo watchdog. &quot;We'd be concerned,&quot; Mr. Freedenberg says. &quot;Most emphatically yes.&quot;    The Poles, on the other hand, aren't concerned in the least. &quot;For you, this maybe is politics,&quot; says Mr. Kaluzny, the software writer. &quot;For me, it is not politics. It is business.&quot;    And for Roman Szwed, it is research. In Warsaw University's physics department, he keeps the computer stock up to date. &quot;I'm not a tradesman,&quot; says Mr. Szwed, a young physicist in a leather vest and white clogs. &quot;I don't make money. But without computers, you can't do anything. Now, how to get computers?&quot;    He can't simply order one from the outside world. The embargo makes that hard: His department once had to wait four years to get its hands on the gift of an obsolete mainframe while Washington made up its mind to grant an export license. And the matter of money makes it harder.    &quot;A university never has dollars,&quot; Mr. Szwed says. &quot;Where would we get? For us, it is much easier to get zlotys. Tens of millions. Then, of course, I buy. From whom I don't care.&quot;    He can choose from dozens of middlemen, who buy from thousands of Poles, who start the process by sending their dollars to people like Ellery Yu of Inswell Enterprise Co., Jen Ai Road, Taipei, or Andrew Lukomski of Polanglia Ltd., Uxbridge Road, London.    Mr. Lukomski, a pin-striped Pole who has lived in Latin America and the Mideast, is a distributor for Amstrad PLC. He distributes in Poland and lives in London. Driving a silver Mercedes there one breezy English day, he picks up a visitor and heads for Polanglia's office, where a secretary is busy on the phone, speaking Polish.    &quot;We have enormous demand,&quot; he says. &quot;We get sometimes 100 letters a day. People thank us for giving them the chance to build a house or buy a car.&quot;    Not all of Amstrad's Polish customers buy from Polanglia, though. A few, Mr. Lukomski feels sure, buy Amstrad's IBM-compatible PCs in British stores and truck them into Poland tagged as unrestricted home computers. Others fly them out as personal luggage. Working in the West, Polanglia can't compete, either, with embargo-free clone dealers in Taiwan. Still, Mr. Lukomski insists, &quot;we would never break any rule or law.&quot;    So the company dutifully seeks an export license for each of its purchasers, supplying individual names and addresses in Poland to Britain's Department of Trade and Industry.    &quot;The final user must be identified,&quot; says Mr. Lukomski. &quot;This is the whole point. If the department doesn't approve of the final user, it can deny the license. It has never happened to us. We don't sell to the army.&quot; Just the same, Polanglia takes care not to file applications for outsized shipments. &quot;It becomes suspicious,&quot; Mr. Lukomski says, &quot;so we keep our orders small. Otherwise, we'd have to wait six months.&quot;    Back in Poland, the final users with their names on the export licenses wouldn't go for that. They are anxious to turn their small orders into big ones and pass them on to the final final users -- state ministries and enterprises. Prices are falling, quick turnover vital.    One such Pole, whose first name is Jacek, has turned turnover into an art.    &quot;Somebody told me I could bring computers into Poland,&quot; he says in a Warsaw apartment. &quot;So I experimented.&quot;    He started with $500, earned legally. A friend took the money to Berlin, bought a printer and brought it home, where Jacek sold it for a million zlotys, the black-market equivalent of $1,000. &quot;It took seven weeks from the idea to the money,&quot; he says.    Jacek then replenished his dollar supply and smuggled it back to Berlin in the pocket of a foreign businessman. The businessman passed the money to a connection who bought two hard disks for $650 and air-freighted them to Jacek, who sold them before he left the airport and doubled his money again. Next Jacek traveled to Berlin himself, carried home more printers and unloaded them for $2,000. And then he mail-ordered an $800 hard disk from London and sold it for $1,700.    Only in the last transaction did Jacek wait for an export license. He won't have to bother with that again; now he buys computers from Ellery Yu in Taiwan for $1,500 apiece and sells them for $3,000 -- no license needed. It is awkward to send currency out, so he has to get a Polish bank to illegally write cashier's checks on black-market dollars. &quot;There are ways to overcome such restrictions,&quot; Jacek says. &quot;I'm coming to like this business.&quot;    Two types of people take the equipment off Jacek's hands. Most are private middlemen, incorporated under a 1935 law the Communists somehow forgot to repeal. And some, like Agrokomputer, a company with a showroom on Pulawska Street, are not so private. Its largest shareholder is a youth group run by the state.    &quot;We buy from so-called personal import,&quot; says the showroom's manager, Henryk Jablonski, sitting at the counter as customers come and go. &quot;We know how much to pay because we know how much we can sell for. We have a feel for the market.&quot;    A very privileged feel, if several computer-savvy Poles have it right. They say that Agrokomputer buys in bulk for the Polish army. Faced with that scale of competition, the private middlemen have to offer both their suppliers and their customers something extra.    &quot;Two things are necessary,&quot; says Leonard Rozanski, a busy fixer who has to pull the plug of his apartment phone for a moment's peace. &quot;First I need state clients. Then I must ask individuals to buy the computers they need.&quot;    One of his many private rivals, Tadeusz Szudrawski, does more. For the state's end users, he will write special programs in Polish, create networks, run training sessions, fix faults. He even provides a oneyear warranty. And he pays his suppliers top zloty.    &quot;We organize groups of buyers ourselves,&quot; Mr. Szudrawski says at a crowded home-computer fair one Sunday afternoon. &quot;There's no problem finding people to buy computers. It's friends of friends.&quot;    All of which has made life easier in the Warsaw University physics department. Private middlemen have delivered 50 powerful PCs from Taiwan to Roman Szwed, who is in the market for 50 more.    &quot;I'd prefer to buy direct from the U.S.,&quot; he says, standing in the doorway of the department's basement computer center, &quot;but it's my duty to keep things going in our little environment.&quot;    Work stations fill the room before him, each with a PC and a number-crunching researcher. Beyond them, in a room behind a glass wall, stands a big mainframe from Czechoslovakia. The room is dark. Nobody goes in there anymore. </TEXT></DOC>
