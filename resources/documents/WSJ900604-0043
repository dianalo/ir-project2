He said it excludedcandidates who had popular support but were opposed byliberal party insiders. Mr. Silber has led in recent polls oflikely primary voters.   The convention here was marred by picketing Springfieldpolice officers, who delayed its start by more than threehours as delegates refused to cross the line. But thepicketers, some of whom were chanting &quot;four more years,&quot;clearly sided with the Republican party, leading to chargesthat the protest -- over a contract dispute -- wasdeliberately staged to disrupt the convention.   A White House political aide, Ronald Kaufman, and stateRepublican Party Director Alexander Tennant were inSpringfield during the weekend, but denied any involvement inthe protest.</TEXT></DOC>
