Other major fundgroups, including T. Rowe Price Associates, Scudder Stevens andamp;Clark and Vanguard Group, say that bond fund sales this monthhave been at, or near, record levels.</LP><TEXT>   Final numbers for July's bond fund sales won't beavailable until late next month. But fund company executivesexpect the number to be far ahead of June's tally, when bondfunds pulled in $4.4 billion more than they surrendered todeparting shareholders.   This year, bond funds have pulled in $25.3 billion throughJune, putting the fund industry on track for one of its bestyears ever for sales. The previous record year was 1986, whenbond funds pulled in more than $108 billion.   &quot;Interest rate shock has continued,&quot; says Bruce Speca, asenior vice president with TNE Fund Group, a unit of NewEngland Mutual Life Insurance Co. &quot;Every month we're outthere with {money fund} rates below 6%, our bond fund salesget stronger.&quot;   Measly yields on certificates of deposit and bank moneymarket accounts are driving investors out of these ultra-safeinvestments and into riskier bond funds, where the value ofyour investment fluctuates on a daily basis as a bond fund'sshare price bounces up and down.   But investors seem willing to suffer through those shareprice swings because of the higher yields that bond fundsoffer. Government National Mortgage Association or &quot;GinnieMae&quot; bond funds, for instance, are yielding 7.8% andhigh-yielding junk bond funds 12.2%, according to LipperAnalytical Services. Money market funds, meanwhile, areoffering yields of around 5.5%.   Fund groups say that switches out of low-yielding moneyfunds and into bond funds account for only part of the surgein bond fund assets. &quot;Most of our money is coming fromoutside of the fund family,&quot; says Gavin Quill, a marketingresearch analyst with Scudder. &quot;It must be coming from thebank money market accounts and the certificates of deposit.It's brand new money into the mutual fund industry thatwasn't there a month ago.&quot;   Much of the new bond fund money seems to have ended up infunds holding bonds with a relatively short time untilmaturity. &quot;Sales aren't nearly so strong in the long-termbond funds,&quot; says Mr. Quill.   June's $4.4 billion inflow into bond funds was slightlylower than the level in May, when bond funds attracted almost$5 billion, according to Investment Company Institute datareleased yesterday. (The inflow figures consist of bond fundsales to new investors, minus redemptions by departingshareholders, plus the net result of switches between bondfunds and other funds in the same fund group. Reinvesteddividends are excluded.)   Stock fund inflows haven't been nearly so strong. &quot;Thestock market has been trading in such a remarkably narrowrange for such a long time that people are confused aboutwhich way it's going to go,&quot; says Tim Pitts, an executivevice president with New York's Oppenheimer Management Corp.   During June, stock funds pulled in just $952 million, wellbelow the $3.5 billion attracted during May. But fund groupssay that July's sales have been stronger than June's. &quot;InJuly, we've had a real surge back into stocks,&quot; saysFidelity's Mr. Hines.   A further pickup in stock fund sales is likely in themonths ahead, says Mr. Hines, who cites a survey done forFidelity by the University of Michigan Survey ResearchCenter. The survey, which looks at the net purchaseintentions of mutual fund shareholders, found that 24%planned to invest in stock funds over the next three months,up from 18% in June. (These numbers reflect the percentageplanning to buy a stock fund, minus those planning to sell.)   For much of this year, stock fund managers have beencontent to hold large quantities of money-market instruments.At the end of May, for instance, stock funds were sitting on$29.1 billion in cash. That was $904 million above what theyheld at the end of 1990.   But in June, stock fund managers began buying shares inearnest. During the month, they invested all the money pulledin from new investors, plus an additional $2.4 billion, sothat by the end of June stock fund cash holdings stood atless than $26.7 billion. That's equal to just 9% of stockfund assets, the lowest level since April 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
