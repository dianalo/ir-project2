For the meridional prevailing wind no significantvariation was found. The same comparison as for winter was done for summerwhere the previous investigations gave no correlation. Now the radarmeteor wind measurement values, too, showed a significant negative correlationof the zonal prevailing wind with solar activity for the years 1976 to1983. The ionospheric drift measurement results of Collm have the sametendency but a larger dispersion due to the lower accuracy of the harmonicanalysis because of the shorter daily measuring interval in summer. Continuouswind observations in the upper mesopause region over more than 20 yearsrevealed distinct long term variations, the origin of which cannot beexplained with the present knowledge.</TEXT></DOC>
