Leaders of the rebels, known as Contras, claimed Sandinistatroops entered Honduran territory. The Sandinistas denied the claimand a Honduran military spokesman in Tegucigalpa, the Hondurancapital, said he had received no reports of incursions into hiscountry's territory.   The Defense Ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said ``the army has undertaken major offensiveoperations ... reports that the army has penetrated Honduras arenot true.''   ``The army is developing a major military offensive at thismoment. We will inform you in due time,'' he added.   Contra spokesmen in Washington and Miami claimed that Sandinistatroops had crossed into neighboring Honduran territory in pursuitof rebel forces, who have secret base camps across the border.   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, a spokesman for the Honduran armedforces, said he had no reports of Sandinista incursions.   ``Nevertheless, tomorrow we will probably be able to report onthe situation (along the border),'' he said   A Honduran government source, who spoke with the condition henot be identified, said President Jose Azcona Hoyo was watching thesituation closely and a government team ``is monitoring reports onthe subject.''   In a speech to celebrate Women's Day, President Daniel Ortegasaid on March 8 that ``the Sandinista army is on combat alert'' butgave no details at the time.   Ortega at the time said the combat alert was in response to theContras' refusal to join the Sandinistas in cease-fire talks theyhad planned beginning March 9 in the small southern Nicaraguan townof Sapoa.   Ortega said his government had information the rebels wereplanning to attack the Sandinista army ``at border points on theHonduran frontier.''   Vice President Sergio Ramirez confirmed to reporters Monday thatthe Sandinista army was engaged ``in actions of a certain size'' indifferent points in the country, but did not specify what locationswere involved.   The Contras' clandestine Liberation Radio claimed Tuesday therewas heavy fighting for the past week in the northern 5th MilitaryRegion that includes Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juan and ZelayaSouth provinces.   Sandinista military sources, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said about 6,000 government troops were involved in whatthey called ``an important anti-insurgent operation.''   Contra radio claimed the Sandinista army was carrying out``genocidal bombardments'' in Chontales province, dropping 500- and1,000-pound bombs from helicopters.   ``Many peasants had to flee for fear of being torn to pieces,''the radio said.   Sandinista military sources in Juigalpa, capital of Chontalesprovince, told The Associated Press on Tuesday the Sandinista armywas using ``various military means, including helicopters'' todislodge Contra rebels who had been dominating the region formonths.   Sandinista and Contra leaders had agreed to hold cease-firetalks, for the first time inside Nicaraguan territory, at SapoaMarch 21-23. The offensive appeared to be an effort by theSandinista regime to start negotiating from a position of strength.   Other military sources in Managua, who also spoke on conditionof anonymity, said the Sandinista army ``unleashed a greatoffensive in the northern part of the country,'' but the DefenseMinistry issued no reports.   Up until Tuesday afternoon, the ministry and military sourceslimited themselves to issuing ``routine'' news bulletins and otherreports to keep the offensive a secret, the sources said.   In Washington, Contra leaders said Nicaraguan forces wereknocking the Contras back.   ``They have overrun certain of our positions,'' said ErnestoPalazio, director of the Contras' Washington office.   Sandinista sources said the army sent reinforcements toChontales province, where fighting appeared to be heaviest, andgovernment troops were using helicopters and heavy artilleryagainst the rebels.   Defense Ministry reports Tuesday said two rebels were killedMonday near Rio Blanco, a town in northern Matagalpa province,where a civilian was also killed by the Contras. They said twoother rebels were shot dead near the town of Pancasan.   An additional 31 Contras were killed in scattered fighting inChontales, Rio San Juan and the southeastern province of ZelayaSouth since Friday, the reports said. They said a rebel ambushkilled seven Sandinista soldiers and wounded eight near the ZelayaSouth town of Nueva Guinea.</TEXT></DOC>
