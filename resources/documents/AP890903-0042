No, this was a real vacation, pureand simple, he insisted.   Just to make sure everyone got the point, Bush spent the lastthree weeks showcasing his good time.   Americans saw him boating, playing tennis, golfing, dining out,jogging, playing ball and otherwise having daily doses of fun.   His self-ascribed nickname, Mr. Smooth, became almost a householdword. His bad-luck fishing streak was the subject of media accountsnationwide.   And when the president on a dare stripped off his shirt andleaped into the sea with his slacks on, the burst of goofiness wascarried on the nightly news.   Bush spent more hours in the public eye during his vacation thanhe normally does at the White House.   Unlike many past presidents who used vacations to get out of thelimelight, Bush seemed to relish the chance to show off hisrecreational penchants.   Away from the suit-and-tie world of Washington, Bush was a studyin perpetual sports motion. His golf speed _ 18 holes in around twohours _ was dubbed ``aerobic golf'' by presidential physicianLawrence Mohr.   A keen competitive streak, tempered by apparent goodsportsmanship, was evident in everything he did from fishing tohorseshoes.   Some might even say the president showed himself to be somethingof a ham.   There was the Sunday when he could have sent the press corps homefor a few hours after taking them to two church services. Instead heinvited them to his Walker's Point compound to watch his tennismatch.   Typically, the president's activities on Walker's Point are notobserved by the press corps. But on this day, he suggested maybe thereporters would like to see ``Mr. Smooth'' in action on the courts.   Mr. Smooth is the name Bush uses for himself in horseshoes andgolf _ as in, ``Here comes Mr. Smooth.''   When the press corps began covering the president's Kennebunkportgolf outings some months back, reporters and photographers watchedhim tee off, then picked him up again on the last hole.   Now, the small press pool that accompanies him to the coursecovers anywhere from four holes to all 18, with Bush's approval.   He was even heard to mutter,``I do better when they're here''when he made a good drive after the cameras showed up on the 17thtee during an otherwise lackluster round.   In fact, Bush seemed to enjoy the golf audience, clowning for thecameras especially when he made a good shot.   On the ocean, there was no solitude for Bush on his daily jauntsin his speedboat Fidelity. In addition to a Coast Guard cutter andSecret Service boats that escorted him, he was trailed by afive-boat flotilla of media chase vessels.   That didn't seem to bother Bush, except he contended at one pointthey were scaring off the fish. That excuse was not heard after Bushfriends began catching fish off Fidelity even when the presidentialhook remained bare.   The chase boats generally were beyond shouting distance, but Bushsometimes allowed them in close for a photograph.   Far from seeming to have had enough of the omnipresent mediacoverage, Bush often invited it.   One day he piloted Fidelity, filled with children andgrandchildren, close to shore where a handful of reporters wereengaged in other matters. He began a shouted chitchat with themacross the waters.   He stayed until a camera crew was positioned on the shore, thenroared off into the sunshine, framing a picture perfect shot.   Instead of holing up in privacy _ like Ronald Reagan at his SantaBarbara ranch or Richard Nixon at his seaside San Clemente _ Bushwas out every day. He surprised tourists and local residents bydriving his boat up to dockside restaurants or gasoline wharfs.   He and first lady Barbara Bush had small or large dinner partiesalmost every night.   On Sundays, there was church, with Bush shaking hands with thecongregation afterward. On the last Sunday of his vacation he madesome remarks from the pulpit and promptly went out and caught thefirst fish of his summer break.   He had a steady stream of overnight visitors to Walker's Point _including the honeymooning Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter andhis bride, the family of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, andevangelist Billy Graham.   Reporters who showed up in running clothes to cover his morningjogs were invited to join him.   Bush took note of all the fun he was having in a speech _ theonly one of his trip _ to the local Chamber of Commerce.   `` We are doing some work, but I have confessed at the veryoutset that this is a pure, total vacation. And I'm not going tolook busy in order to convince people in America that it's somethingother than a vacation,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
