Attorney General Dick Thornburgh blamed the rejection on ``rawpolitics,'' but administration officials said they would not seekto overturn the committee's decision on the floor of the Senate.   The committee first deadlocked 7-7 on a motion to approve thenomination, leaving Lucas one vote short of the majority he needed.On an identical vote, the panel then rejected a Republican move tosend the nomination to the floor without recommendation.   All six committee Republicans and Democrat Dennis DeConcini ofArizona voted in favor of Lucas, a black Democrat-turned-Republicanwho served as Wayne County sheriff in Michigan. All the no voteswere cast by Democrats.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said thecommittee's action ``is very disappointing to the president. ... Wefelt he (Lucas) deserved better treatment and he deserved thatposition.''   ``In terms of where we go from here, we're now exploring ouroptions,'' Fitzwater added.   The committee's action was a stinging defeat for President Bush,who said last week he supported Lucas ``100 percent'' and wasconvinced ``that much _ not all _ that much of the criticism of himis pure American politics.''   But Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., a conservative southerner whocast a critical vote against Lucas, said, ``He's lacking inexperience and qualifications, his managerial accomplishments aredebatable.''   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said on the Senate floor thathe had urged Bush to make a so-called recess appointment underwhich Lucas could serve in the post for a number of months withoutbeing confirmed.   Bush could make such an appointment as soon as Congressrecesses, scheduled for the end of the week. ``If they will notgive him the simple chance to make his case, then the president ofthe United States should do so with a recess appointment,'' Dolesaid.   Asked about Dole's suggestion, Fitzwater said, ``No decisionshave been made...about either Mr. Lucas' future or how we mightapproach the job at the Justice Department.''   Lucas was opposed by many civil rights groups who said he wasnot a strong enough advocate for affirmative action and othertraditional civil rights concerns.   He told the committee it was too early to evaluate recentSupreme Court decisions narrowing the scope of civil rights laws onjob bias, minority set-asides and other issues. He also declinedinvitations from senators to express concern about the directionthe country is taking in civil rights matters.   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel conceded defeat forthe nomination and said the agency had no other candidates ``as oftoday.''   Lucas had no immediate comment. Runkel said he would continue towork at the Justice Department as a $284.50-per-day consultantuntil he completes an analysis of the department's role inenforcing civil rights. The contract is up March 20, 1990.   ``As a result of raw politics, a man who has demonstrated hisability over a 40-year time span as a social worker, policeofficer, an FBI agent, a sheriff and a county government leader tomake a difference for the benefit of many Americans has been deniedthe opportunity to continue to serve,'' Thornburgh said.   Republicans compared the committee's rejection of Lucas to theSenate's refusal to confirm Robert Bork for the U.S. Supreme Court.Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., accused critics of refusing to ``givethis black man a chance.''   ``He's a minority, of course. Years ago minorities didn't have achance, I know,'' said Thurmond, who was one of the Senate's mostimplacable opponents of civil rights in the era of racialsegregation.   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., saidThurmond's accusation amounted to ``a cynical setup'' because mostof the critics were supporters of civil rights and were concernedmainly about Lucas' qualifications.   ``It seems to me that Bill Lucas has failed miserably to provethat he has some knowledge to compensate for his lack ofexperience,'' Biden said.   After the committee rejected confirmation, Thurmond moved tosend the nomination to the floor without any recommendation. Butthat was blocked on an identical 7-7 vote.   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., was the last Republican to fall intoline behind Lucas, telling a news conference last week that ``it'smore important to have someone who understands Supreme Courtdecisions from personal experience, knows it, so to speak, in hisgut, as opposed to someone who knows where to put all the commasand semicolons.''   Civil rights groups have campaigned against Lucas, saying helacks experience. Committee Republicans contend that the61-year-old black nominee would apply the lessons he learned in hisrise from dishwasher to FBI agent to Wayne County, Mich., sheriffand county executive.   Lucas also came under fire for failing to declare $8,884 worthof goods to U.S. Customs following an Asian trip, not makingcourt-ordered jail improvements when he was Wayne County sheriffand for inaccuracies on an application for admission to the NewYork bar. Critics also accused him of a conflict of interestinvolving a county building project and cited court findings thathe was lax in investigating police brutality charges.   On the customs matter, Lucas said he was not aware the goodswere in his family's luggage. He said he did his best on jailimprovements and ultimately was responsible for a new jail. He saidhe saw no conflict of interest on the county building project andinvestigated the police brutality charges as soon as he found outabout them.   The panel had scheduled a vote for last Thursday, but delayedaction after Heflin said he wanted more time to look into newallegations. The nature of those allegations was unknown.   Sens. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, hadsaid they would oppose Lucas.   ``For assistant attorney general for civil rights, I just thinkthat we need a strong voice who will speak out for civil rights andI don't hear that coming from Bill Lucas,'' Simon said.   His supporters, including the Rev. Joseph Lowery of the SouthernChristian Leadership Conference, said there was no practical wayfor him to oppose Bush administration policy, which holds that itwill take time to assess the impact of the Supreme Court decisions.   Simon and other lawmakers, however, said Lucas appeared to lacksufficient zeal for civil rights.</TEXT></DOC>
