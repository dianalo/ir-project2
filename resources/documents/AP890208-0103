Some Los Angeles suburbs closed schools after getting up to 2inches of snow, but there was little opportunity for surfers tobuild snowmen in the sand.   ``Every once in a while the wind blows some flakes down here onthe beach,'' said Bill Gould, who works at a gas station in Malibu.   ``Snow, snow, snow and lots of snow!'' said Los Angeles PoliceOfficer Bill Vaughn, who was in the San Fernando Valley 20 milesnorthwest of downtown Los Angeles. ``Everybody's rolling out theirPolaroids and taking pictures of it.''   After more than a week of record cold in the lower 48 states,warmer temperatures today gave fruit farmers and others something tocheer about.   ``The freeze-a-thon is over,'' the National Weather Servicedeclared in San Antonio, Texas.   ``It does seem to be a trend,'' agreed meteorologist Bob Johns atthe weather service's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City,Mo.   ``It looks like we'll continue to have cold temperatures but itdoesn't look like it'll be as extreme.''   Not that spring is just around the corner. Temperatures today inmost places were only slightly higher than those Tuesday, whenrecords were set in dozens of cities.   The record-breaking cold continued in several cities, includingBoise, Idaho, with minus 10 degrees; Ely, Nev., minus 22, andSacramento, Calif., 23 degrees. Salt Lake City's minus 7 tied itsrecord for the date.   The bitter cold was expected to linger in Colorado particularly,where it was 35 below zero early today in the town of Craig. Andmore cold weather came calling from Canada, moving into the northernPlains on Tuesday and hitting the Great Lakes with strong wind andnear-blizzard conditions.   ``It's just terrible,'' said Dan Luna, a meteorologist for theNational Weather Service in Marquette, Mich. ``We just now recordeda gust of wind up to 45 miles per hour.''   At least 89 deaths have been attributed to the weather since Jan.31, when bitter arctic air from Alaska made its way into the lower48 states. In one such death Tuesday, an elderly woman who had morethan $5,000 stashed in her plywood shack in Laredo, Texas, died ofhypothermia.   In Idaho, where as many as 1,600 cattle and sheep have died intowering snow drifts, National Guardsmen in helicopters flew overthe countryside to help ranchers search for surviving livestock. Fewwere found.   But in one indication of a thaw, the temperature in Fairbanks,Alaska, climbed above zero Tuesday for the first time in 26 days.   ``It's been quite a while,'' Fairbanks meteorologist John Lingaassaid. He predicted that the mercury, which hit 8 above Tuesday,would be into the 20s by Thursday.   Low temperatures in much of California climbed back abovefreezing early today, ending the crisis for the state'smultibillion-dollar agriculture industry.   Still, farmers said the freeze has already caused serious damageto some citrus crops, prompting increases in the wholesale price oforanges.   ``The lemon crop in the San Joaquin Valley may have beenobliterated,'' said Richard Pescosolido, farm manager for SequoiaOrange Co. in Exeter.   Washington state's $2.7 million apricot crop, the nation's secondlargest, was badly damaged by the cold, county extension agentssaid, and the state's winter wheat crop remains threatened. But inTexas' Rio Grande Valley, citrus growers said damage to their cropswas light.   ``We really came through very well,'' said Ray Prewett, executivedirector of Texas Citrus Mutual, a McAllen-based growers'organization. ``It'll take a few days to make a final determination,but it looks good.''   Still, all was not balmy in Texas. Houston today broke itsall-time record of 110 consecutive hours of freezing temperatures. A28-degree reading pushed the record to 111 hours, but thetemperature rose above freezing an hour later to end the streak.   Homeless people continued to flock to shelters in San Francisco,although they, too, were cheered by the prospect of slightly lesschilling weather. The city's temperature early today was 40 degrees.   ``I'm thrilled out of my mind that it's going to be just a littleless cold, even though it's not exactly going to warm up,'' saidJason Derick, 33, a homeless man who planned to spend the night in acubicle at San Francisco's Civic Center.   There were reports of homeless people being turned away fromoverflowing shelters in Las Vegas, which on Tuesday had its coldestFebruary day ever with a low of 16 degrees. Ice formed in thefountains at Caesars Palace.   Further north, in Reno, more than 400 people crowded intoshelters to escape record lows of 16 below zero. ``We took in morepeople than we were supposed to,'' said Salvation Army Capt. KennethOsbourn. ``We can't turn anybody out in this kind of weather.''   In New Orleans, officials said cold weather on Fat Tuesday helddown the Mardi Gras crowd to somewhat below the expected 1.8million. People also blamed the weather for this year's scant supplyof bare flesh.   ``This one's been a little too cold, but it's still been a lot offun,'' said French Quarter resident Barbara Rusina. ``We're drinkingwhiskey to keep warm.''</TEXT></DOC>
