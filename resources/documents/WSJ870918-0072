HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> F FIN GOVMTTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board will try to negotiate an acquisition of Financial Corp. of America by Ford Motor Co. at the same time it investigates a plan to break up Financial Corp. and auction the pieces, thrift industry officials said.    The Bank Board has decided to pursue the parallel strategies for resolving the troubles of Financial Corp., parent of the nation's largest thrift, to reduce the costs to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the officials said.    Roger Martin, one of three members of the Bank Board, said in an interview last night that Financial Corp. estimates its break-up plan would cost the FSLIC $1.2 billion to $2 billion over 10 years. Mr. Martin said the Bank Board staff believes an acquisition as proposed by Ford could cost the FSLIC $3 billion to $4.5 billion over five years.    An official of Ford's thrift unit, First Nationwide Bank, declined to comment. However, thrift industry officials familiar with the Ford proposal said the auto maker estimated that it would cost the FSLIC $1.4 billion in total if interest rates remain stable. The cost would rise if interest rates rise, they said.    Ford submitted to the Bank Board this summer an outline of its proposed purchase of Financial Corp.    Anthony M. Frank, chairman of Ford's First Nationwide unit, is believed to be anxious to acquire Financial Corp. to expand First Nationwide's California branch network. Bank Board officials notified First Nationwide of their desire to negotiate last night, thrift-industry officials said.    Ford has proposed to pump about $1 billion in capital into Financial Corp.'s main unit, American Savings andamp; Loan Association, and to absorb some of Financial Corp.'s future losses. But most of the losses would be absorbed by the FSLIC.    Under its former chairman, Edwin J. Gray, the Bank Board launched an effort to find an acquirer of Financial Corp., and Ford emerged as the leading candidate. The board's current chairman, M. Danny Wall, has said he feels less urgency than Mr. Gray to resolve the troubles of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp.    The break-up plan, which is being developed by Financial Corp. and the thrift consulting firm of Kaplan, Smith andamp; Associates, hinges on FCA's ability to sell its massive tax benefits. Troubled thrifts, unlike most other firms, were granted permission under the new tax law to sell their tax benefits. Any type of company can purchase those benefits.    However, Financial Corp. officials said any sale of the tax benefits would have to be approved in advance by the Internal Revenue Service to ensure that the buyer would be able to use them.    It's unclear whether a break-up of Financial Corp. can be structured in a way that will satisfy the concerns of the IRS, the FSLIC and potential buyers of the pieces.    William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp., described the break-up plan in an interview yesterday as &quot;no more than a research project,&quot; and said, &quot;there are a lot of legal and accounting problems&quot; to be resolved.    However, Mr. Martin of the Bank Board said Financial Corp. officials hope to present an outline of the break-up plan to the Bank Board at a private meeting during the week of Sept. 28. Mr. Martin met with company officials at Financial Corp.'s headquarters Monday.    Mr. Martin said the plan would divide Financial Corp. into four parts: a unit that would include the tax benefits; a unit affiliated with the Bank Board that would sell five-year securities backed by mortgage-backed instruments currently in Financial Corp.'s portfolio; a healthy thrift that would include Financial Corp.'s 178 branches, deposits and good loans; and a basket of troubled loans and real estate that the FSLIC would absorb.    Mr. Martin said it isn't clear what would happen to current Financial Corp. shareholders under the break-up plan. &quot;Until we can determine the values, that (still) has to be resolved,&quot; he said.    There also appear to be substantial obstacles to the break-up plan.    Mr. Popejoy noted that the tax benefits, estimated at as much as $1.8 billion, can be sold only if there is a business purpose to the transaction other than selling the benefits. That means the unit with the benefits must include other assets or operations, such as thrift branches, real estate, loans or mortgage-backed securities. &quot;We've virtually spent hundreds of thousands of dollars (researching the tax issue) and the only thing I know is that it's an art, not a science,&quot; Mr. Popejoy said.    Selling Financial Corp.'s mortgage-backed securities also could involve a substantial loss. Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., estimates that the portfolio, purchased for about $17.4 billion, has a market value of about $2.5 billion less than that. Mr. Popejoy said the portfolio has unrealized losses, but he wouldn't specify an amount. </TEXT></DOC>
