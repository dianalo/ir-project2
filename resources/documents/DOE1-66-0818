Most of them have not put into practical use with someexceptions, such as solar systems and solar cells. The technical developmentcovers a wide field, including coal liquefaction, coal gasification,fuel cells, geothermal energy, and biomass energy. It involves many studyelements and development subjects for raising efficiency and reducingcost. In the electric power industry, energetic effort is being paidfor technical development of new energies, including solar energy, fuelcells, and wind power generation. According to the long-term strategyfor technical development, development effort should be focused on nuclearenergy and coal. This paper gives comprehensive discussion on variousproblems of the electric power industry which will see the days of compoundenergy in the 21st century. (3 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
