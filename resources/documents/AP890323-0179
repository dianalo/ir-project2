He also said his banned independent union movement will look foranswers ``in the streets and by strikes'' if no final agreement onreforms is reached at historic talks between the opposition andCommunist leaders.   Neither will Solidarity tolerate ``tricks'' by officials inimplementing an accord, he said.   Walesa made the statements at a news conference in his home cityof Gdansk and in a subsequent telephone interview with TheAssociated Press.   At the talks in Warsaw, negotiators continued to discuss economicand political topics separating the two sides.   Walesa's comments cast doubt on whether a final agreement couldbe signed April 3 as planned. He said he would need about a week tostudy the document, which could be hundreds of pages long.   ``I must familiarize myself with the entire material. ... Even ifit takes more time, it will be understood, because we must do itwell,'' Walesa said.   A decision to run for the existing parliament or for a newlycreated senate would depend ``on the wish of the voters,'' he said.   ``I don't want to be a candidate. But there are situations whenone must do it,'' Walesa said later by telephone. ``But I reallywould not like to, simply because there are many people better thanme.''   Elections with opposition participation are part of thefar-reaching compromise authorities are seeking at the talks. Inexchange for legalization, Solidarity would agree to elections thatguarantee in advance that a Communist-led coalition would get 65percent of the existing parliament seats.   But the new senate would be fully democratic, with oppositioncandidates running against Communist-approved candidates for thefirst time in the East bloc.   Although Solidarity has said it would support candidates inelections to the existing parliament, tentatively planned for June,most union officials have said they would prefer to concentrate onunion issues.   Some Solidarity activists also have expressed concern privatelythat the union might not be able to find candidates quickly enoughto run for the 35 percent of the 460 seats to be open to theopposition, and for the 100 or so seats contemplated for the newsenate.   ``There may be, for example, a situation when I'll have to agree(to run) because other people refuse,'' Walesa said in the telephoneinterview. ``But I really don't want to.''   Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, wasborn in 1980 and banned after martial law was imposed in 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
