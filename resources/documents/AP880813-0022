The Bellevue-based company said the trucks subject to the recallwere produced after March and range in value from $60,000 to morethan $100,000 apiece.   Paccar spokesman Jack McRae said the gearbox supplier, Ross GearDivision of TRW, asked Paccar to suspend delivery of its top-of-theline class 8 trucks because of potential defects. McRae said Paccarand TRW officials met Friday to determine the precise problem andhow to resolve it.   McRae said the company planned to keep production going, thenstore the trucks until the problem is isolated and fixed. Paccarproduces more than 2,000 of the trucks each month.   ``To the best of my knowledge, this is the most significantrecall we've had,'' he said.   Other makers also use the gearbox, McRae added.   No accidents or injuries have been reported, McRae said. As soonas Paccar found out about the problem it sent out messages todealers urging them to tell owners of Peterbilt and Kenworth trucksbuilt since March to pull them off the road, the company said.   Paccar issued a statement at the close of the business dayThursday about the problem.   The stock market initially failed to take notice. An hour intotrading Friday, the stock was ahead 12.5 cents at $36.875 a share.After a Dow Jones News Service headline on Paccar appeared 75minutes into the trading day, the stock quickly plunged. Four hourslater, about an hour before the market closed, Paccar had fallen to$33.50 a share on volume of 482,000 shares. In all of June, Paccarvolume was 760,700.   McRae said based on what little the company knows about theproblem so far, it will not cause serious financial loss.</TEXT></DOC>
