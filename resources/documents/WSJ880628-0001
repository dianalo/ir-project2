In the three months since Tokyo bowed to U.S. pressure and agreed to ease barriers to foreign competition, big Japanese construction companies have forged alliances with U.S. architectural and construction firms. Public agencies and private companies have encouraged foreign concerns to bid for construction projects.    It isn't all smooth sailing. Industry analysts warn it will take time and patience to make the joint ventures pay off. Some Americans worry that the U.S. construction industry might too easily trade away its advanced technology for an insubstantial piece of the Japanese market. Also, Japan has said it would suspend the March agreement if the U.S. extends past October legislation that limits Japanese builders' participation in American public-works projects. (Sources in Congress and the U.S. industry say there is little likelihood that will happen as long as Japan observes the pact in good faith.)    Nevertheless, officials from both sides hope the slowly evolving Japanese attitudes can survive the inevitable short-term frictions. Already, the more-open stance is producing results, most strikingly in the competition for the design of a terminal building at Kansai International Airport, a multibillion-dollar project in Osaka that triggered the trade dispute.    Of the 15 companies put on a short list last month by state-financed Kansai International Airport Corp. from a field of 48 applicants, 11 were either foreign firms or joint ventures between Japanese and foreign concerns. Four of Japan's six largest construction firms that had made the list are applying jointly with American architectural firms, and a fifth has tied up with a British company, Foster Associates. Among the Americans are Ellerbe Becket Inc., a unit of Ellerbe Group Inc. of Minneapolis; Parsons Overseas Co., a unit of Parsons Corp. of Pasedena, Calif., which has teamed up with Shimizu Construction Co.; and I.M. Pei andamp; Partners, which has joined with Kumagai Gumi Co. The participants will submit designs by November, and the winner will be chosen around December.    Early signs of change are also evident in the private sector. Shuwa Corp., a leading Tokyo-based real-estate developer, is inviting foreign companies to take part in building 14 buildings in Tokyo during the next two years. Shuwa invests heavily in U.S. real-estate -- it bought the Los Angeles Arco Plaza building for $620 million in 1987 -- so it has a natural stake in wanting smooth bilateral relations.    Shuwa's president, Shigeru Kobayashi, carried his proposal personally to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. &quot;He's being a good citizen,&quot; says the Tokyo-branch director of one of the largest U.S. construction companies. &quot;Before, we didn't see many private-sector people jumping up and saying, 'Come on over, Americans.' Now, other people that have a vested interest in seeing that happen will step forward.&quot;    Experts on the Japanese construction market have always said links with Japanese companies would be the best way for foreign companies to start out. Even before the March agreement, several such partnerships were announced, including the link-up of Fluor Daniel Japan Inc., a unit of Fluor Corp. of the U.S., with Ohbayashi Corp., and Bechtel Group Inc.'s collaboration with Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone. (Last Friday, Fluor Daniel Japan filed an application to enter Japan's construction market.)    In early June, Turner Corp. announced an agreement to pursue construction work in Japan and the U.S. with Kumagai Gumi, and Shimizu agreed to consider joint ventures with subsidiaries of Parsons. Taisei Corp. is talking with Bechtel.    Japan's system of operating by consensus helps explain why outsiders are suddenly getting the welcome mat. The fact the government supports foreign participation in construction projects means that the domestic industry agreed to the change, though perhaps reluctantly. Once that breakthrough was made, companies, fearing reverse discrimination, scrambled to forge overseas links. &quot;It's seen as an advantage,&quot; says Atsushi Suzuki of the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, an independent organization linked to the Construction Ministry.    Japanese companies also want to ensure continued access to the U.S. market, where last year they did an estimated $2.5 billion of business, up from $2 billion in 1986. Partnerships could forestall protectionism in the U.S.    But full participation by foreigners will take time. Most of the U.S.-Japan agreements are cautious attempts to test the water. In general, they are nonexclusive, project-by-project arrangements involving no capital outlays.    &quot;It's a natural occurrence at this stage,&quot; says a U.S. government official. &quot;They want to get to know each other before they get married.&quot;    Some Americans also worry the partnerships could favor the Japanese. &quot;The Japanese construction company will be the one that is going to build, not the American company,&quot; says Theodore Ury of PAE International, the Tokyo subsidiary of Pacific Architects andamp; Engineers Inc.    Other observers warn that foreign companies risk trading precious technology for a tenuous foothold in Japan. &quot;It's clear that the very large Japanese firms are interested in learning and are interested in tie-ups that help them learn,&quot; says Eleanor Westney, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who is studying Japanese contractors. She urges large U.S. companies to look for partners among second-tier Japanese companies that might be &quot;hungrier&quot; than the giants.    Much of the interest from U.S. companies remains in the architecture, design and supply areas, not in the heavy-construction sector where the higher price-tag contracts will be had. U.S. firms remain wary of investing the money needed to set up in Japan from scratch, partly out of fear that the Japanese will keep up their tradition of dividing up contracts for private projects behind closed doors.    This kind of wan response could mean Americans don't win as many Japanese contracts as they would like, and that could threaten U.S.-Japan relations again when Congress tallies the results of the agreement in October.    &quot;It would be a shame, because there wouldn't be enough of a test one way or the other,&quot; the U.S. official says. &quot;I'd like to see that the process be given sufficient time to play itself out.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
