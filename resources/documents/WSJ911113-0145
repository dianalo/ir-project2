Bankers Trust is putting up around $210 million, and usingthe $355 million in cash on the company's books to purchasewhat's left of Integrated for $565 million. That's up from a$176 million cash outlay and an initial price-tag of $526million offered in June. The initial talks broke down inAugust over terms.</LP><TEXT>   Integrated Resources, the former high-flying syndicator ofreal-estate limited partnerships, said yesterday it signed aletter of intent with Bankers Trust &quot;to work towardsconsummating a plan of reorganization.&quot;   Bruce C. Tully, managing director at Bankers Trust, said&quot;at present Integrated consists of a portfolio of financialassets, the type of which we're adept at analyzing andenhancing.&quot; He declined to comment further. By sweetening theoffer, Bankers Trust won approval from two creditorcommittees representing roughly $1.4 billion of its $2billion in debt. A bankruptcy reorganization would wipe outIntegrated's debt by paying creditors a fraction of theirclaims with the cash proceeds.   Integrated Chairman Stephen D. Weinroth said the new bid&quot;maximizes value for the estate, which is our main task.&quot;   Still, the deal, which requires bankruptcy-court approval,could fall apart. Integrated said it is still consideringproposals from others. An official familiar with the talkssaid the Pritzker family, one of Chicago's wealthiestfamilies and owner of Hyatt Corp., has recently proposed topurchase the company but is seeking additional information.An official at Pritzker andamp; Pritzker, a family-controlledpartnership, couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Weinrothdeclined to comment.   Also, Hallwood Group L.P. offered a package of cash andsecurities for Integrated, though its chances are consideredslim. And subordinated creditors holding about $675 millionin debt -- and facing the likelihood of recovering little ofthat -- are likely to pose an obstacle. Edward Weisfelner, anattorney representing the subordinated creditors, said hewould seek to delay coming bankruptcy hearings until bidderssuch as the Pritzkers have time to analyze the company'sfinancial condition. He said the Pritzker's bid wascompetitive with the Bankers Trust proposal.   &quot;We believe the company can do better if the Pritzkers areafforded an opportunity for due diligence,&quot; said Mr.Weisfelner, of Berlack, Israels andamp; Liberman.   Integrated filed for bankruptcy-law protection in February1990, hurt by an inability to meet maturing debt obligations.The company, which was the largest seller of tax shelters inthe U.S., has been shedding assets for the past 18 months toraise cash to pay off creditors.   The remaining assets consist of equity and debt of variousleveraged buy-outs, an equipment leasing concern, and 147&quot;contract rights,&quot; or limited partnership notes. These notesare backed by rents from tenants, who sell properties to thepartnerships and then lease them back.   Bankers Trust's merchant banking arm is expected to pursuea goal of liquidating the portfolio within three years,partly by selling assets individually or packaged assecurities. The company's partnership notes have a cumulativeearnings stream of about $1.7 billion over the next 30 yearsthat Bankers will try to realize.   Bankers Trust has garnered significant returns from itsmerchant banking efforts in recent years, analysts said.While the company doesn't specifically break out theirearnings from equity holdings, &quot;they've rather consistentlyproduced solid gains in venture capital,&quot; said RobertAlbertson, banking analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;They'vedemonstrated a history of savvy merchant banking.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
