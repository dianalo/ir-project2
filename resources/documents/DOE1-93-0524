The impact of transient outages has a significantimpact on the reliability levels of individual consumers being servicedby a utility network. This paper illustrates the relative differencesin the reliability indices of the standard IEEE 14 bus test network evaluatedby the approximate and exact third-order minimal-cut set approach includingand excluding the impact of transient component outages.</TEXT></DOC>
