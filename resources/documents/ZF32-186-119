(analysis of the memory-processorrelationship) (tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Krick, Robert F.; Dollas, Apostolos.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The instruction sequencing relationship between computer memoryand a processor can be modeled as a 'producer-consumer' dynamic.andO;This is based on the fact that the execution of an instruction bya processor is a serial temporal process that first requiresupdating an instruction pointer, then fetching the instruction.andO;Consequently, a processor can not execute instructions faster thanthey are fetched from memory.andP;  Instructions are typicallycomputational, which execute sequentially, or branch, which mayalter and slow the execution flow.andP;  Most instruction sequencescontain both.andP;  Interinstruction dependencies can further slowexecution time of branch instructions.andP;  Improvinginstruction-execution performance can be accomplished by use ofmore advanced memory and processor technologies and by increasedpipelining.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Instruction ExecutionSystem DesignPerformance ImprovementMethodsSequential ProcessingModelsPipeliningTutorial.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Interrelationship of the timing parameters for instructionsequencing.
