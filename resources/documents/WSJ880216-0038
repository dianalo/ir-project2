But Steinberg said that it is continuing to seek offers from outside parties for the sale of the company.    Unicorp, a Toronto-based investment holding company, and two partners launched its two-step offer, valued at as much as 980 million Canadian dollars ($775.3 million), last month after Steinberg said it was seeking offers for the sale of the company. The offer expires today.    The quest for bids was touched off by a feud among members of Montreal's Steinberg family, who control the retail concern. The Unicorp group's offer, which was termed as low by securities analysts, is the only offer to emerge thus far.    Mortimer Freiheit, lawyer for one side of the family, said the offer was rejected because evaluations of the company's assets commissioned by both Steinberg and the family haven't been completed. &quot;Until these valuations come, there isn't any point in dealing with the (Unicorp) offer.&quot;    Mr. Freiheit said serious talks have been under way for a week between family members &quot;with a view to resolving the whole situation.&quot; He said the family's goal remains the &quot;maximizing of shareholder values.&quot;    Unicorp officials weren't immediately available to comment on the rejection of the bid but Unicorp had said earlier it wouldn't extend the bid.    James Leech, Unicorp president, said he isn't convinced that members of the Steinberg family really intend to sell their stake. &quot;It appears that the waters are still very, very muddied,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the assumption that the situation had crystalized but clearly it hasn't.&quot;    The first part of the Unicorp bid, which expires today, is an offer of 50 dollars for each of Steinberg's six million common shares outstanding, or 300 million dollars. The voting shares aren't publicly traded and are held primarily by Steinberg family members.    The offer is subject to a minimum of 51% of the voting shares being tendered. The Unicorp group has said it plans an offer of at least 40 dollars a share for the 17 million, publicly traded, Class A nonvoting shares, but only if at least 90% of the voting shares are tendered.    Separately, Steinberg reported profit fell 45% for its fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 9 because of the cost of modernizing supermarkets, lower profit at a sugar-manufacturing affiliate and the effects of a supermarket-warehouse strike.    Net income for the quarter was 8.3 million dollars, or 28 cents a share, compared with 15.2 million dollars, or 67 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 1.6% to 1.11 billion dollars from 1.10 billion dollars.    Martin Kaufman, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., Montreal, termed the results disappointing. &quot;They were even lower than what I thought.&quot;    Steinberg Class A shares closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 41.25 dollars each, down 1.75 dollars. </TEXT></DOC>
