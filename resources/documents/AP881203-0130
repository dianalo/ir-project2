Israel radio broadcast festive songs throughout the night, andbakeries served the special sugar-coated jelly doughnuts that are aholiday tradition.   Hanukkah marks the victory of the Jews over the Greco-Syriankingdom in 165 B.C. The kingdom had tried to impose its culture onthe Jews and desecrated the holy temple in Jerusalem with statues ofGreek gods. The statues were regarded as pagan idols, which areanathema to Jews.   The Jews rose in revolt, destroyed the statues and drove theSyrians out of Israel.   According to legend, when the Jews tried to relight the temple'seternal flame, they found enough oil for one day. But the firemiraculously lasted for eight days.   To commemorate the holiday, candles are lighted at sunset foreight consecutive nights. They are placed one at a time in a specialeight-branch candelabra called a menorah.   Fried foods such as potato pancakes and doughnuts are eaten tocommemorate the miracle of the oil.   The festival is celebrated by religious and secular Jews as aholiday that not only marks the ancient Jewish victory but alsoreminds Israelis of their desire to perpetuate national Jewishidentity.</TEXT></DOC>
