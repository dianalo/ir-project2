<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-50-0672 </DOCNO><TEXT>Results of a systematic study of the existence of superconductivity inY-Ba-Cu-O and Y-Ba-Sr-Cu-O systems are presented. Single-phase YBa{sub2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 9} specimens have been prepared with a transition temperatureof 91 K and delta Tc = 2 K. In addition, Y{sub 2}Ba{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub8} specimens have been shown to have an initial Tc of 94 K and zero resistanceat 73 K right after 12-hour heating in air at 950 C. An important findingis the probability of achieving superconductivity in the Y-Ba-Sr-Cu-Osystem. 11 references.</TEXT></DOC>
