With respect to the prospects of Federal Republic ofGermany-United States relations, it is almost certain that arms controlissues will retain a significance that goes far beyond their military-technicalimpact and extends into fundamental questions about the future of thetransatlantic alliance. West German attitudes, among decision makersas well as among the public at large, are and will continue to be formedby the issue of arms control. The author says that issue will reverberateand extend into adjacent issues of West German-U.S. relations and affectthem for years to come.</TEXT></DOC>
