CDC said existing vaccines against H. flu b -- haemophilus influenzae Type B -- aren't capable of providing consistent levels of protection against the bacteria in children under two years of age.    H. flu b is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in young children. Meningitis is a sometimes fatal inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. H. flu b also can cause skin infections and a swelling in the throat that may interfere with breathing, in addition to other diseases.    The new vaccine will be manufactured and distributed by CDC's Connaught Laboratories Inc. unit in Swiftwater, Pa.    CDC said applications will be made soon for approval to administer ProHIBiT TM to children as young as two months old. </TEXT></DOC>
