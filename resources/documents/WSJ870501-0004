Harris Jr.Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WIXRETAILING (RET)TEXTILES AND APPAREL (TEX) </IN><TEXT>   Wickes Cos. now believes that employees of its carpet-making unit sent phony carpet samples to be tested by an independent laboratory, resulting in the delivery of millions of dollars of carpeting that didn't meet certain local fire safety standards.    Edmund M. Kaufman, an outside Wickes director who heads a company &quot;task force&quot; studying the carpet problem, said the investigation so far has indicated that employees in some cases &quot;made up a sample which would pass the test and sent it to the lab,&quot; even though they knew the carpet that had been manufactured was substandard.    &quot;The lab assumed they were getting the right sample and reported the test results. Unfortunately, it didn't have anything to do with the carpet&quot; actually being sold to customers, Mr. Kaufman said.    He said four employees had been fired so far, and that the company investigation is continuing.    Wickes last month disclosed that a newly acquired unit had produced and sold for a decade about $360 million of commercial-grade, polyvinyl chloride-backed carpeting that didn't meet certain smoke density or flammability standards specified by some local building codes or other standards of customers, including the federal government. The carpet, sold almost entirely to commercial and institutional customers, was made in a Dalton, Ga., plant of the Floor Coverings division of Collins andamp; Aikman Corp., which Wickes acquired in January for $1.16 billion.    Wickes, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based retailer and manufacturer, said at the time that while it believed the carpeting is safe and that there hadn't been any safety-related incidents blamed on the product, it expected to have to spend &quot;a material amount&quot; to resolve the problem. It said the task force had been set up to investigate the cause of the problem and to locate and deal with customers, among other issues. Wickes says production and delivery of the questioned carpeting has been stopped.    The company also said that its auditor, Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., had indicated it would qualify its opinion on Wickes's financial statements for the year ended Jan. 31 because of the problem.    Mr. Kaufman said in a telephone interview that Wickes yesterday gave information from its investigation to the General Services Administration, which is the main purchasing agent for the federal government.    According to a GSA spokesman interviewed prior to the meeting with Wickes, the agency had purchased an estimated $26.8 million of carpet from Collins andamp; Aikman from 1980 through last September, and currently has a $3.9 million contract to purchase carpet that expires this September. Mr. Kaufman said that the GSA has asked Wickes to provide a proposal for handling its commitments to deliver carpet under the current contract.    The GSA spokesman said that the government had received certified test results when Collins andamp; Aikman sold it the carpet, showing that all requirements were met.    He said that after Wickes disclosed the carpet problem, the GSA had ordered retesting at two independent labs of some of the product delivered to it, although results of the retesting weren't yet available.    Mr. Kaufman said the division employees took the actions without the knowledge of superiors. He said of the four terminated employees: &quot;They did something they were forbidden to do. It was totally improper. It was wrong. They did this without corporate authority.&quot;    Wickes hasn't yet determined the volume of carpet sent that didn't meet proper specifications, although it has said that more than 30 million square yards of the questioned carpeting has been sold in the last 10 years.    Company officials, who haven't publicly identified customers other than the federal government, have said the job of determining Wickes's liability is complicated because of the plethora of local standards governing the flame-spreading and smoke-density characteristics of carpeting. Further, many customers don't require any standards other than the basic federal flammability standard. Wickes maintains that all the Collins andamp; Aikman carpeting meets that standard.    Mr. Kaufman, a Los Angeles attorney, said Wickes learned of the problem after a school district in Pinellas County, Fla., discovered its carpet didn't meet the smoke density specifications in its carpet-purchasing contract.    Mr. Kaufman said that Wickes paid to replace some newly installed carpet at the school district. But he said that action was taken before the improper carpet testing was discovered, and he maintained that such an expensive measure as carpet replacement &quot;isn't an appropriate remedy&quot; in most cases that Wickes expects to settle with customers.    He said it was premature to discuss what solutions Wickes may propose when delivery of substandard carpeting is confirmed. The company has placed a high priority, however, on establishing the size of its potential liability so that reserves can be established and the auditor's qualification lifted, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
