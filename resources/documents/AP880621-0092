(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials of a rocket fuel plant thatexploded last month say they have reached agreement with rocketproducer Morton Thiokol Inc. and NASA to provide the requiredfinancial support for building a new plant.   Pacific Engineering and Production Co. said Monday it would seek$33 million in bank financing to rebuild the plant on a sitefarther from residents.   Two people were killed and 326 injured in the May 4 explosionthat caused $73 million damage as it leveled the PacificEngineering plant and damaged dozens of other buildings for milesaround.   Pacific Engineering President Fred Gibson Jr. reiterated in astatement Monday that the company believed the blast was caused bya natural gas line at the plant.   Southwest Gas Corp. and Clark County fire officials, however,have discounted natural gas as the cause.   Fire officials have not issued their report on the blast, butdepartment sources have said the most likely cause was a spark thatset off the fuel. Union officials have alleged safety violations.   Under the rebuilding plan, the bank loan would be repaid overseven years with installments based on sales, profit and cash flow,according to the company statement.   The remainder after seven years will be paid by the government,the statement said, but it did not specify the amount.   The plan was agreed to by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and Morton Thiokol, which manufactures the solidrocket fuel boosters that use the fuel component made by the plant,the statement said.   ``We have reviewed a large number of potential (plant) sites,two of which are approximately 60 miles northeast of Las Vegas,''Gibson said, but added that none had been selected.   The plant is said to be vital to the nation's space program. Itand another Henderson plant, owned by Kerr-McGee Corp., are theonly two plants in the nation making ammonium perchlorate, whichprovides the oxygen necessary to burn solid fuel in the boosterrockets.   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials saidafter the blast that they had enough ammonium perchlorate left foreight shuttle boosters, or four flights.   The Kerr-McGee plant stopped producing the chemical after theblast but resumed the production last week.   Government agencies agreed earlier this month to allow PacificEngineering and Kerr-McGee to levy a surcharge to cover rebuildingand expansion costs.</TEXT></DOC>
