<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-1086 </DOCNO><TEXT>The source Sgr B2 has been mapped with a single-dish resolution of {similar_to}40sec. at frequencies of 23 GHz and 43 GHz ({lambda} = 1.3 cm and 6.9 mmrespectively). An extended thermal component was found, and has beencompared with that in lower frequency observations. The core region ofSgr B2 (containing the compact sources MD4 and MD5) was resolved at both23 GHz and 43 GHz. The compact components MD4 and MD5 have complex thermalspectra which may indicate inhomogeneities within each compact core.A new source, G0.64-0.06, was found in the southern area of the extendedthermal component. The 43-GHz map made with the Nobeyama 45-m telescopewas also convolved to an angular resolution of 1.3 min, for comparisonwith a 10.7-GHz map made with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. This comparisonsuggests that there may be some nonthermal emission in the southern areaof Sgr B2.</TEXT></DOC>
