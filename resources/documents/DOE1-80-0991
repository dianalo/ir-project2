Adsorption of cobalt ions on hematiteparticles proceeded via the exchange reaction of cobalt ion with thesurface hydroxyl of the hematite. The equilibrium constant for the adsorptionat 285{sup 0}C was found to be about 570 times as large as that at 20{sup0}C. The adsorbate formed cobalt ferrite at the rate of 3.4 x 10/sup-2/ g-Co/g-Co adsorbed/h. The dissolution rates of cobalt ferrite andcobalt oxide particles were found to depend on (H/sup +/)/sup 1.1/ and(H/sup +/)/sup 1.2/, respectively, where (H/sup +/) means the H/sup +/concentration. Cobalt ions were released from these oxides when O/sup2/- ions in them combined with two aqueous protons to form water at theoxide-water interface. Cobalt behavior on the fuel rod surface underBWR conditions was discussed using the experimental results.</TEXT></DOC>
