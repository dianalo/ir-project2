Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermann said the arrests showedthat Soviet bloc spy networks were redoubling undercover work inthe West, despite improved superpower relations.   West Germany's counterintelligence agents ``have dealt a seriousblow to Eastern espionage agencies,'' Zimmermann said in astatement.   ``The large number of arrests confirms that instead ofrefraining from activating agents in a time of political detente(between East and West), the East bloc is intensifying the illegalactivities of its operatives,'' he added.   Security sources said the arrests were made during a series ofpolice raids last week. Federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said theymarked ``an important penetration of the KGB spy network'' in WestGermany.   An foreign engineer living in Zurich was arrested Wednesday on atip from West Germany, Swiss prosecutors said. They did notdisclose his name or nationality but said they had launched acriminal investigation into his activities.   Spy scandals and arrests are frequent in West Germany, afront-line NATO ally and one of Western Europe's mosttechnologically advanced nations.   In the last major espionage scandal, 15 communist agents werearrested or disappeared between August and December 1985.   Rebmann said 10 people were taken into custody Wednesday andThursday as part of a nationwide crackdown against espionagetargets. The raids were carried out by 169 police officers in 33locations, according to Rebmann.   He said six of the 10 taken into custody remained in jail onMonday, and that investigations were continuing against the fourwho were released.   In addition, inquiries were under way against 14 other espionagesuspects, for a total of 24 separate investigations, the prosecutorsaid. He declined to say how many of the cases were likely toresult in charges.   He said those in custody included two teachers, three engineersand a businessman, all of whom are suspected of working for theKGB. Three were Soviet emigres living in West Germany.   One suspect, businessman Helmut Stefan Kolasch, is believed tohave worked for the KGB since 1971, Rebmann said. Kolasch, 44,allegedly gave the KGB technological secrets about NATO's Tornadoand Jaeger warplanes while working for firms dealing with theaircraft, he said.   Rebmann identified the other jailed suspects as Peter Friesen,33, an engineer; George Bender, 37, also an engineer; Shimon Or,48, a teacher; Edmund Neufert, 37, another teacher. Anothersuspect, a Colombian engineer, was identified by Rebmann only as``Amaya.''   The prosecutor said all six were living in West Germany.   Rebmann said Amaya also handed over unidentified technicaldocuments to the KGB; Friesen spied on West German politicalparties, Bender reported to the KGB about a ``large electronicsconcern'' he worked for, and Neufert spied on students whileteaching Russian at the Foreign Ministry's language-training office.   Rebmann said Or ``reported (to the KGB) on his own life andwork,'' but he did not provide details.   None of the suspected spies apparently knew one another and wereoperating individually, the prosecutor told reporters.   The police raids followed the March 18 arrest of a governmentsecretary who was also suspected of having worked for the KGB.
