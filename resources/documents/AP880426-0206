It is a tie at once physical, emotional, psychological andmystical,'' Reagan said.   ``The mark of motherhood ... is a devotion to the well-being ofthe child so total that it overlooks itself and its own preferencesand needs. It is a love that risks all, bears all, braves all,''the proclamation said.   ``As it heals and strengthens and inspires in its objects anunderstanding of self-sacrifice and devotion, it is the parent ofmany another love as well.''   Reagan said ``generation after generation has measured love bythe work and wonder of motherhood. For these gifts, ever ancientand ever new, we cannot pause too often to give thanks to mothers.   ``As inadequate as our homage may be and as short as a singleday is to express it ... Mother's Day affords us an opportunity tomeet one of life's happiest duties.''</TEXT></DOC>
