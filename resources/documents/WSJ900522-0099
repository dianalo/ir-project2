The Cypress counterclaim, filed here in federal court,alleges that Advanced Micro's acquisition of MonolithicMemories was part of a plan to obtain Cypress technology andmonopolize the market in violation of state and federalantitrust law. Cypress also alleges that Monolithic Memoriesdefrauded it as part of the earlier exchange becauseMonolithic Memories knew that the patent rights it purportedto license were being challenged in court.   Cypress, which has been the target of some 20 lawsuitsover the past seven years and has settled them all, said thecounterclaim was &quot;the first time Cypress has gone on thelegal offensive.&quot;   &quot;I got a bag of worthless patents, and they got $10million,&quot; said T.J. Rodgers, president and chief executiveofficer of Cypress, noting that Monolithic Memories receivedCypress stock as part of the 1983 transaction. &quot;I want mychips back, and I want my technology back and I wantdamages.&quot;   Advanced Micro, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., called thecountersuit &quot;the standard response of a patent infringer&quot; andtermed the fraud claim &quot;bizarre.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
