But the idea was so crazy it was brilliant. In today's expandinguniverse of pay-per-view television, no programming concoction istoo outrageous for those addicted viewers cruising for a new videofix.   With pay-per-view, cable television subscribers can wolf down abuffet of television ``events'' _ including movies, concerts, boxingand more than enough wrestling _ without winching themselves off thesofa. Seats are front-row and, best of all, there are usually nostupid commercials.   Car-race fanatics with $13 to spare can see the Miller High Life500 on June 17 with no breaks in the action.   Stir-crazy businessmen, taking shelter in some Holiday Inn, canfork over $7 for a private television broadcast of a soft-core pornomovie.   Thousands of viewers are expected to shell out 15 bucks in Aprilto watch Evel Knievel's son go motorcycle jumping.   And in 1992, NBC will offer up to 200 hours of selected SummerOlympic events on a pay-per-view basis, the network announced Dec.22.   With so many options, there's a heap of money coming through thedoor. Pay-per-view will become a billion-dollar industry within 10years, up from less than $100 million in 1988, according to industryestimates.   ``It's completely convenient,'' said Jerry Hartman, vicepresident of marketing and sales for Universal Pay TV. ``At eighto'clock, if you're bored, you can watch something. You don't have toget up. You don't have to go to the video store or anywhere else.''   In theory, the pay-per-view process is simple enough: you order``Good Morning, Vietnam'' at 7 p.m., it arrives de-scrambled on yourtelevision set an hour later, and the movie's charged on your nextbill. In practice, however, it can be a more frustrating experience.   While most of today's pay-per-view transactions (from $5 to $40)are conducted over the phone, future technologies may streamline theprocess to a single remote control. Optical-fiber``video-on-demand'' cable systems, now being tested in SouthernCalifornia by GTE Corp., will supply hundreds more titles at anytime in the day.   For pay-per-view companies, the easier the transaction, thebrighter the future. Parents, beware.   Pay-per-view caters to the same impulsive buyers who grab cheappens and eyeglass nose cushions at supermarket checkouts _ neverrealizing they could probably do without until it's too late. Withpay-per-view, though, there's the added chance that, just once, thepurchase could be electrifying.   About 600,000 fans optimistically coughed up $35 per home towatch last June's ``fight'' between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks,which ended abruptly after 91 seconds. The Nov. 7 title matchbetween Sugar Ray Leonard and Donny Lalonde brought in close to $20million in pay-per-view grosses, just behind the Tyson-Spinksreceipts.   ``I think people love the excitement of a big championshipfight,'' said Jeffrey Reiss, chairman of pay-per-view giant RequestTelevision. ``You can have a group of people over to the house forthe price of one ticket ... and have a beer and popcorn party.''   Nielsen ratings that would make network programmers scribble outsuicide notes can be solid gold on pay-per-view, due to higherprofit margins. ``We can make money on one rating point,'' saidScott Kurnit, president of Showtime Event Television.   Although pay-per-view has been workable throughout the 1980s,only 21 percent of the country's 45 million cable households nowhave equipment permitting phone orders. That figure may double by1990, and 40 million homes may have access to pay-per-view by 1994,according to estimates by Paul Kagan Associates, a media researchfirm.   Yet the long-touted promise of pay-per-view has been slow inarriving, stalled by poor marketing, film-studio fears andtechnological obstacles.   Cable television's reputation for poor customer service hasn'tencouraged subscribers to experiment with a more complicatedproduct. ``There's still a long way to go in consumer marketing,''said Tim Clott, executive vice president of the video division atParamount Pictures. ``And we want to find a technology thatprohibits home taping.''   The studios don't want pay-per-view broadcasts to undermine the$2 billion home video market. Worried that pay-per-view customerswill videotape their purchases, the studios typically offer moviesto pay-per-view systems more than a month after their home-videodebut, thereby dulling the excitement.   Meanwhile, pay-per-view program options continue expanding.   Robbie Knievel, Evel's son, will try to hurdle the Caesar'sPalace fountains on April 14. ABC, CBS and NBC won't have it, butyou can see the leap (or crash) on Showtime Event Television. OnFeb. 10, Request Television will carry a taped concert of FrankSinatra, Liza Minelli and Sammy Davis Jr., at $14.95.   Leaders in the pay-per-view business are predicting that Broadwayopenings, more pop music concerts, art auctions, business seminarsand possibly the Super Bowl and the World Series soon could becomepay-per-view staples.   So, in the end, pay-per-view's future may lie in giving customersthose unusual attractions they can't find at theaters, in videostores, or on any other broadcast or cable television channel.   Said Showtime's Kurnit: ``We've always looked at the eventbusiness as where we'll make our money.''   What the word ``event'' comes to mean, though, is anybody's guess.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, Feb. 3</NOTE></DOC>
