So the originatorfollowed up with Crosstalk Mark IV, but users found that it was too powerfulas well as so different from the previous version that many preferred tostick with the old one, and so now Digital Communications is coming out witha new version 2.0 of the unpopular Crosstalk Mark IV - but this time itemulates Crosstalk XVI, so that it can eliminate the original one and sell asingle product; the new version has a stupid menu-style &quot;dialling directory&quot;as well as the splendid two-letter command line interface of Crosstalk XVI orthe Crosstalk Mark IV one with its extensive script language - but, inanother unfortunate development, the new version remains memory-resident buttakes up a ridiculous 300Kb; the thing costs $245, $65 for Mark IV users, $85for XVI users; we'll stick to XVI.andM;- o -andM;According to a report by Ovum Ltd, the Spanish company IDS SA is top inEurope when it comes to applied artificial intelligence development and theapplication and implementation of expert systems in the real world: Ovumranks IDS over European heavyweights ICL, Thomson and Bull, and Americancorporates DEC,  Texas Instruments and Carnegie; IDS is currently involved indevelopment projects with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology andStanford University to do applications in the fields of neural networks andparallel processing.andM;- o -andM;M/A-Com Inc of Burlington, Massachusetts, has agreed to sell itsTelecommunications Sources Division based in San Jose, California to MagnumMicrowave Corp which is located in Fremont, California; terms of the dealwere not given.andM;- o -andM;At the SuperComm/ICC '90 show held in Atlanta, Georgia the other week,Northern Telecom Ltd was showing off its Switched Digital Video System: thisis a system for controlling the distribution of video signals over fibreoptic cable; the demonstration system can provide viewing of programmes fromup to 64 video sources such as TV networks, cable TV, videotape libraries andlaser disks; with this digital system consumers could also use theirtelevisions to access interactive databases for home office, shopping oreducational services.andM;- o -andM;Pacific Telesys Corp's Pacific Bell subsidiary is setting the pace in addingvalue and flexibility to the concept of the toll-free 800 number concept:under its new service, user scan set up toll-free numbers on ordinarybusiness telephone lines and specify where they want the toll-free number tobe available, from throughout the state (of California) down to a singlecommunity; statewide coverage will be provided in tandem with a long-distancecarrier chosen by the customer - and prices are claimed to be 20% to 60%lower than the company's existing 800 services.andM;- o -andM;The L M Ericsson Telefon AB annual survey on demand for its AXE local andtransit exchanges reveals that, out of a total of 635 AXEs on order, 197 willbe installed in Central and South America, a figure that reflects theadvances in telecommunications being made on that continent: Brazil has atotal of 48 AXEs on order, but Mexico, whose PTT Telefonos de Mexico is upfor privatisation - Ericsson is thought by some to be one of the favouredcontender for a major share - is to give Ericsson most business with ordersfor 84 exchanges; for the AXE in cellular networks, the UK is set to providethe Swedes with more revenues than anyone else, having ordered another sevenAXEs to add to the 24 already installed here.andM;- o -andM;Microsoft Corp has launched a Russian-language version of MS-DOS 4.01 whichuses a Cyrillic character set on screen as well as supporting printers withCyrillic fonts, while menus appear in Russian: the translation was carriedout by Microsoft and Dialogue, a Soviet-American computer joint ventureformed in 1988; Microsoft is now negotiating to sell software in the localcurrency and the company may open a Moscow office sometime next year if aform of convertibility is found.andM;- o -andM;GEC Plessey Telecommunications has received an order worth #2.5m from ChinaRailways for the supply of four System X digital exchanges and 20 iSDXprivate branch exchanges as part of the China Ministry of Railways' massivemodernisation programme: teh new System Xs will be installed on theZhenseshou-Wuhan section of the fully electrified route between Peking andGuangzhou.andM;- o -andM;Santa Clara-based Sequel Inc, recently spun-off from Unisys Corp (CI No1,323) has the rights from the bankruptcy court to the Priam Corp name andcertain Priam patents, as well as to the equipment and inventory of Priam'smaintenance businesses: Sequel has acquired the equipment and inventory torepair or manufacture Priam 14&quot;, 8&quot; standard, 8&quot; advanced, and 5.25&quot; V100drives and related components and also supports the Priam DataDrawer.andM;- o -andM;Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Sunnyvale, California says it is now shipping involume what it claims is industry's fastest commercially available 1M-bitEPROM: manufactured in an &quot;aggressive&quot; CMOS technology (hold that tiger!)andO;that &quot;results in the industry's smallest die size, the Am27H010 features a45nS access time: designers can maximise system performance by designingtheir code to be executed directly from the EPROM, without the need for waitstates, eliminating cache and bank interleaved memory architectures that takeup valuable board space; organised 128K by 8 bits, the 45nS Am27H010 is $40for 1,000-up in commercial temperature ranges in ceramic DIP packages; the1,000-up price for the 55nS version is $27 and there are also 70nS and 90nSversions.andM;- o -andM;Paris-based Esker SA has a new TCP/IP-based Unix-to-MS-DOS communicationsapplication, Tun*Plus available for #440: it is also offering Tun terminalemulation software for #190, a file transfer system at an additional #100,Tun graphics at #340 and a graphics library, #590.andM;- o -andM;Hughes Aircraft's Ground Systems Group based in Fullerton, California, is totrade in 1,000 old Apple Mac and MS-DOS personal computers for new Macintoshand IBM systems while saving over 50% off normal list prices in a buy-backprogramme it has struck with Businessland.andM;- o -andM;Prime Computer Inc has added a diagnostic software program for use withapplications running under its Pick-based Prime Information system: calledMonitor.Program, the program is designed to enable users to identify parts ofthe application that could be further improved - by examining reports fromthe thing, technically-knowledgeable users or consultants can spot segmentsof code that could be improved; it's $2,000 to $9,000 according to the sizeof the 50 Series mini.andM;- o -andM;Commenting on its figures (page five) Texas Instruments Inc says that sharplylower memory chip prices and sluggish memory volumes more than offsetcontinued growth in VLSI semiconductor products and taht as a result, thechipmaking operations were running at a loss; the firm expects the secondquarter to be as difficult as the first.andM;- o -andM;The decision to give the Queen's Award for Technology to GEC PlesseyTelecommunications Ltd may well have come only just in time: set in motionback in the 1960s when the Post Office commissioned Plessey to develop anelectronic exchange, the System X project has overcome endless setbacks -notably constant changes of specification by the Post Office resulting in adesign with little export potential, and plenty of technical snags since thefirst installations in the late 1970s, and the award can be viewed as a paton the back for finally getting it right; but now, with Siemens AG having 40%of GEC Plessey, ostensibly to clear the path for its rival EWSD, the longedfor happy ending to the System X story is looking less and less likely.andM;- o -andM;Queen Anne may not be feeling herself today: ICL has just issued a pressrelease announcing that it is to make its Officepower Unix office automationsoftware - of which it has versions for the 68000 and iAPX-86 families andfor the Sparc, available on other vendors' equipment: fine, except that weran the story last September (CI No 1,259) with the added information that itwas working on versions for Sun Microsystems' Sun-3, Convergent Inc's CTServer 386 and S-series, and the Sanyo/Icon multiprocessors.andM;- o -andM;In case you hadn't noticed, Micro Focus has recently been advertising for aCobol evangelist (someone who will help to develop the product and willauthoritatively and vociferously defend it against repeated claims that it isdead) and has now filled the vacancy by appointing Jerry Garfunkel to theposition: Garfunkel (brother of Art) has always been part of Micro Focus inhis capacity as an independent consultant and has guided the development ofCobol over the past decade, but has now chosen to formalise the relationshipand will be based both at Newbury in the UK and Palo Alto in the US; a MicroFocus employee says he shudders to think what size salary Garfunkel isdrawing from the company but then Micro Focus is cash-rich, and is there amore sensible way of spending your money than ensuring that the god of Cobolis on your side in the 1990s?andM;- o -andM;It's all very well for Japanese manufacturers to announce commitments to buy20% of thir chip requirements from abroad, but they can't just go out and buyall the chips they need to meet the commitment on the world market: SonyCorphopes to get the proportion up to 20% by 1991, but it reckons it willneed to get foreign companies involved right at the design stage.andM;- o -andM;Swiss telecommunications equipment maker Ascom Holding AG, Zurich,precariously small by world standards, wants to cut its rolls by 1,000, 9%over the next two years.andM;- o -andM;When CMP Publications Inc shook up its computer industry newspapers becauseComputer Reseller News and Computer Systems News were increasingly coveringthe same turf, the folks at the latter, once the flagship of the house,clearly drew the short straw, being mandated to cover the excruciatinglyboring and embryonic world of systems integration, where little is happeningas yet and it is far from clear that anyone is going to make real money apartfrom the handful of companies like Electronic Data Systems Corp and HoskynsGroup Plc that have years and years of experience of doing it to draw on: torelieve the tedium, the editors have to come up with ever more surrealheadlines, this week's speciality being &quot;Integration Interruptus&quot; - well itought to please the Pope, anyway.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
