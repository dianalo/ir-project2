Also Saturday, several hundred railroad workers in the city ofLodz ended their strike at the request of Solidarity leader LechWalesa. The workers urged Mazowiecki to grant their pay demands.   Walesa also met with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and SenateMinority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kansas, and gave them a letter forPresident Bush seeking more U.S. economic aid to help Poland'sstruggling economy.   Party Central Committee Secretary Leszek Miller, meanwhile, tolda meeting of leaders of party committees that they should be loyalto the new Solidarity-led government, the state-run PAP news servicereported.   ``There is no conflict between preserving ideological identity asparty members and being loyal to the legal state authorities,''Miller said.   Mazowiecki's meeting with KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov was hishighest-level contact with a Soviet official since the Polish leadertook office last week in a historic transfer of power from theCommunist Party.   ``I liked him,'' Kryuchkov told reporters after he emergedSaturday evening from seeing Mazowiecki at the Office of the Councilof Ministers. ``A solid man.''   According to the KGB chairman, Mazowiecki spoke of his plans forPoland's government while he told Mazowiecki about social reforms inthe Soviet Union. The talks were ``productive and interesting,'' hesaid.   Poland's new prime minister ``knows how to deal with things,''Kryuchkov concluded. ``We wished him great success, and he will besuccessful.''   Polish state television later broadcast the first part of themeeting on its main evening news. ``I am glad I can see you and thatI have my first opportunity to talk to a representative of theSoviet leadership,'' Mazowiecki told his guest.   The irony of Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity activist andformer political prisoner, receiving at his government office thehead of the Soviet intelligence agency is another example of theremarkable changes overtaking Poland and the Communist world.   It also seemed to underscore the high level of Soviet concern asit begins adjusting to the new reality.   Kryuchkov turned up without prior public announcement Saturdayand first met with Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski and theacting interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, whom Mazowieckireplaced as prime minister. Kiszczak then accompanied Kryuchkov tothe meeting with Mazowiecki.   On Friday, Mazowiecki met with the Soviet Union's ambassador toPoland, Vladimir Brovikov, one day after he took office.   The installation of a non-Communist-led government in Poland hasbeen greeted with concern but apparent acceptance in Moscow,although many of the practical ramifications have not been workedout.   Mazowiecki has said that under his Solidarity-led government theCommunist Party will retain the defense and interior ministries andthat Poland will maintain its obligations to the Warsaw Pact andComecon, the East bloc economic alliance.   But it has not been made clear if Mazowiecki as prime ministerwill have access to sensitive state secrets concerning, forinstance, Warsaw Pact defense strategies, or if he will sit in onall the discussions at the annual full Warsaw Pact summits.   Poland is the Soviet Union's largest and most strategic East blocally, linking it to East Germany, the front-line state facing theNATO states in the West.   The KGB, the Committee for State Security, controls the secretpolice, intelligence gathering and border defense for the SovietUnion. Kryuchkov has been chairman since last year and has broughtan unprecedented openness to the post, undergoing questioning fromSoviet legislators and granting several press interviews.   Before meeting Kryuchkov, Mazowiecki flew by helicopter to thesouthern shrine city of Czestochowa for annual ceremonies honoringthe Black Madonna, Poland's most revered icon, at the Jasna Goramonastery.   A meeting of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops was taking placeat the monastery. Mazowiecki is the first practicing Catholic tolead the government in postwar Poland, a country in which more than90 percent of the people consider themselves Catholic.   In other developments Saturday:   _Railroad workers in Lodz, under pressure from Walesa, ended aone-day strike and sent an appeal to Mazowiecki, ``our premier,''asking him to satisfy their pay demands.   The conclusion of the railroad strike at 12:01 a.m. followed anappeal by Walesa that the new prime minister be given a chance tobegin to work. Walesa said Mazowiecki's election was a``breakthrough'' not to be wasted.   Abandoning the strike, rail workers said in a statement, was ``aproof of our support and trust'' for Mazowiecki. The strike byseveral hundreds workers had shut down all local train service.   _Walesa met in Gdansk with the Doles, who delivered a letter ofgreeting from Bush.   ``I am very satisfied,'' Walesa said after the meeting. ``In theUnited States there is great interest in Poland now, and I hopethese visits which are so numerous recently will help encouragedinvestors to get involved in Poland.''   He said he was giving the Doles a letter for Bush asking forincreased U.S. economic involvement in Poland to match the fasterpace of reforms going on.   But Mrs. Dole said after the meeting she did not foreseeimmediate financial aid beyond the $119 million that Bush offeredduring a visit to Poland in July. ``Of course, as we can and when wecan we will hope to increase that aid,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
