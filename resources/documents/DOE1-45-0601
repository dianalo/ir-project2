Gray-gas approximation with appropriate meanabsorption coefficients is utilized when solving the equation of transfer.Frank-Kamenetskii's stationary theory is modified to account for radiativeheat transfer and the qualitative effect of radiation on the steady thermaltheory of ignition is demonstrated. Radiation interaction for an arbitraryoptical thickness is proposed in the form of a dimensionless group, amodified heat transfer number, which is a function of various thermophysicaland radiative parameters such as the radiation-conduction ratio, opticalthickness, the weighted nongrayness, the albedo of isotropic scattering,and wall emissivity. It is concluded that the radiation increases thecritical ignition number in both the optically thick, and optically thinlimits. The effects of emission, wall emissivity, and scattering on theignition number are monotonic, whereas that of absorption diminishesat the thin and thick gas limits.</TEXT></DOC>
