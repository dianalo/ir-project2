(the StarWAN Multi-Bridge,StarWAN Brouter and StarLAN 100 Network Concentrator) (productannouncement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Brown, Carolyn M.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>ATandamp;T introduces the StarWAN Multi-Bridge, StarWAN Brouter andStarLAN 100 Network Concentrator, which are among the firstproducts to connect Ethernet workstations, LANs and WANs to FiberDistributed Data Interface (FDDI) networks.andP;  Connecting Ethernetto FDDI bridges requires transmitting at least 500,000 packets persecond (pps), according to ATandamp;T, to avoid dropping frames andslowing performance; the StarWAN Multi-Bridge features specializedprocessors, high-speed buses and extra memory to allow itsfiltering capacity to move Ethernet frames across an FDDIbackbone.andP;  FDDI and Ethernet use different packet sizes andformats; Multi-Bridge communicates with earlier FDDI bridges usingthe new translation transparent bridging technique that convertspacket sizes and formats.andP;  StarWAN Brouter Model 450 supports theTCP/IP protocol as well as other protocols; it is manufactured byCisco Systems Inc. The StarLAN 100 Network Concentrator wiringcloset hub supports easy expansion of FDDI networks.andP;  The productscost from $3,500 to $15,250.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
