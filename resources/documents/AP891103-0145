A truce in the stalemated civil war was agreed to in April bythe government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army to allowinternational food shipments to be delivered.   A military junta took power in Sudan in June, promising to endthe six-year civil war, and has extended the truce month-by-month.The rebels have gone along and fighting had all but stopped.   But Boucher said the rebel army, which is seeking autonomy forthe largely animist and Christian population in southern Sudan fromthe Moslem-dominated central government, attacked thegovernment-held town of Kurmuk last weekend, forcing the town'sevacuation.   On Tuesday, two unidentified planes bombed the rebel-held townof Yirol, he said.   ``The cease-fire was vitally important in allowing the movementof relief supplies into southern Sudan and averting massstarvation. Renewed fighting will severely hamper this continuingrelief effort,'' Boucher said.   A U.N.-led relief effort, to which the United States has given$115 million, was launched this summer to prevent the famine thatkilled at least 250,000 Sudanese last year.   ``We're particularly distressed by the breakdown at this timebecause of earlier indications that both sides were thinkingpositively about the peace process,'' Boucher said.   He called on both sides to resume the peace negotiations theybegan last August as soon as possible.</TEXT></DOC>
