The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is consideringissuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR-50 issuedto GPU Nuclear Corporation (the licensee), for operation of the Three MileIsland Nuclear Station, Unit 1 (TMI-1), located in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment </ITAG>Identification of Proposed Action This Environmental Assessment is written in connection with the proposedcore uprate for TMI-1 in response to the licensee's application for a licenseamendment dated April 18, 1988. The proposed action would upgrade the ratedcore power level for TMI-1 from the current level of 2535 megawatts-thermal(MWt) to 2568 MWt. This uprate would represent an increase of approximately1.3 percent over the current rated core power and Nuclear Steam SupplySystem (NSSS) thermal power. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed action would increase the TMI-1 electrical output by approximately10 megawatts-electrical (MWe) and thus provide additional electric powerto the electrical power grid which serves industrial, commercial and residentialcustomers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action In December 1972, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission issued the ``FinalEnvironmental Statement Related to Operation of Three Mile Island NuclearStation, Units 1 and 2'' (NUREG-0552). This document evaluates the environmentalimpact associated with the operation of Three Mile Island Units 1 and 2.The Final Environmental Statement (FES) assumed a 30-year operating lifetimefor each unit and was based upon a design thermal rating of 2535 MWt forUnit 1 and 2772 MWt for Unit 2. The staff has reviewed the FES to determineif any significant environmental impacts, other than those previously considered,would result from raising the licensed thermal power level for TMI-1 from2535 MWt to 2568 MWt. <ITAG tagnum="81"> Radiological Impacts </ITAG>The FES discussed population growth or decline by municipality between1960 and 1970 but did not project population growth for the operating lifetimeof TMI-1. However, the FES implied an overall population growth in thearea primarily related to growth of Harrisburg International Airport. Thetrend of population in this area has generally increased very little between1970 and 1980. In fact, the population of Harrisburg (nine miles northwestof TMI-1) has declined from 68,061 in 1970 to about 53,000 in 1980. Thepopulation within a 20 mile radius of TMI-1 was 621,000 in 1970. In 1980,the population within a 30 kilometer radius (18.9 miles) had increasedto about 643,000. Using the methodology of NUREG-0017, ``Calculations ofReleases of Radioactive Materials in Gaseous and Liquid Effluents fromPWRs,'' raising the authorized core thermal power level for TMI-1 as requestedcould result in a maximum increase of 1.3% in total core fission productinventory. Therefore, off-site dose rates from plant radiological effluents(i.e., indirect exposure) would be expected to increase no more than 1.3%.When converted to actual off-site dose commitments, this incremental potentialincrease in off-site releases is insignificant and is more than offsetby the conservations in the FES. The ``1987 Radiological EnvironmentalMonitoring Report for the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station,'' submittedto the staff on April 29, 1988, indicates that radiation doses to the publicfrom TMI-1 operation continue to be well below all regulatory limits andwell within the assumptions used in the staff's FES. For example, the FEScalculated the maximum exposure to an individual due to liquid and airborneeffluents would be 0.72 mrem per year. The 1987 environmental monitoringreport estimated this maximum dose to be 0.16 mrem for the year 1987, orless than 25% of the FES assumption. By comparison, a typical individualliving in the Harrisburg area in 1987 would be expected to receive an annualdose of approximately 288 mrem from natural causes, including radon. Thelower observed levels in radioactive effluents from the plant results ina substantially lower radiological impact than assumed in the FES. Therefore,the staff concludes a 1.3% increase in these effluents, and therefore a1.3% increase in the off-site radiological impact due to liquid and airborneeffluents is insignificant and is bounded by the FES. A similar comparisoncan be shown for direct radiation exposure (i.e., irradiation directlyfrom the reactor itself rather than from effluents released from the reactorsystems) to members of the public at the site boundary and for potentialexposure due to postulated reactor plant accidents. These exposures wereconservatively calculated in the FES and were shown to be low. Thereforean increase of 1.3% is insignificant. The staff considered the incremental increase in occupational (on-site)exposure as part of its assessment of the proposed 1.3% power increase.The 1972 FES did not address occupational exposure for TMI-1. A supplementto the FES for Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI-2) only, issued in December1976 as NUREG-0112, noted that the licensee committed to assure that individualradiation doses and plant population doses would be maintained as low asreasonably achievable (ALARA). Based on experience by the nuclear industryat that time, an estimate of 500 man-rems per year per reactor unit wasmade for expected occupational exposure at TMI-2. Actual personnel exposuressince restart of TMI-1 in late 1985 indicates that exposures are well belowthe estimates for TMI-2 and declining each year. Total exposure at TMI-1for 1986 was 246 person-rems and for 1987 was 174 person-rems, as documentedin the licensee's annual reports to the NRC. This compares favorably tothe current five-year average of 569 person-rems per unit per year foroperating pressurized water reactors (PWRs) in the United States. Sincemost of this exposure is received during maintenance and refueling periods,and not while the reactor is operating, an increase in operating powerlevel of 1.3% would be expected to have an insignificant effect on occupationalexposures at TMI-1, particularly with the licensee's commitment to an ALARAprogram.The staff reviewed the environmental impacts attributable to the transportationof fuel and waste to and from the TMI-1 site. With respect to the normalconditions of transport and possible accidents in transport, the staffconcludes that the environmental impacts are bounded by those identifiedin Table S-4, ``Environmental Impact of Transportation of Fuel and WasteTo and From One Light Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor'' of 10 CFR 51.52.The bases for this conclusion are that: (1) Table S-4 is based on an annualrefueling and an assumption of 60 spent-fuel shipments per reactor year.Presently, TMI-1 is on an 18-month refueling cycle which would, by itself,require fewer spent fuel shipments per reactor year. Reducing the numberof fuel shipments would reduce the overall impacts related to populationexposure and accidents discussed in Table S-4. However, GPU Nuclear hasnot shipped any TMI-1 irradiated fuel off-site to date and has no plansto do so in the near future. (2) Table S-4 represents the contributionof such transportation to annual radiation dose per reactor year to exposedtransportation workers and to the general public. Presently, TMI-1 is authorizedto slightly exceed the fuel enrichment and average fuel irradiation levelsthat are specified in 10 CFR 51.52(a)(2) and (3) as the bases for TableS-4. The radiation levels of the transport fuel casks are limited by theDepartment of Transportation and are not dependent on fuel enrichment and/orirradiation levels. Therefore, the estimated doses to exposed individualsper reactor year will not increase over that specified in Table S-4. Interm of transportation of solid radioactive waste (other than fuel) fromTMI-1, the number of shipments has been well within the assumptions ofthe FES. The FES stated that from 50 to 200 truckloads of solid radioactivewaste would be shipped per year from the TMI site. In 1987, TMI-1 shippedonly 36 truckload of solid radioactive waste.<ITAG tagnum="81">Non-Radiological Impacts</ITAG>Reexamination of the staff's FES of December 1972 reveals that the assessmentsof non-radiological impacts were based on several considerations dependingon the type of impact being addresssed. For some types of impact, the assessmentswere based on a design power level; for other types, the assessments werebased on plant design features, on relative loss of renewable resources,or on relative loss or degradation of available habitat. The staff consideredthose types of impacts that may be influenced by plant power level andalso considered the fact that the FES assumed both Units 1 and 2 to beoperating. TMI-2 has not operated since the March 1979 accident and itis very unlikely to resume operation in the future. Future operation wouldrequire a new environmental impact statement. The following topics wereconsidered for a 1.3% increase in power level at TMI-1:<T3>Consumptive Water Use</T3>_Water usage would be expected to increasebetween 1.5% and 1.7% at the higher power level of 3568 MWt. For the worstcase atmospheric conditions, the increase would be about 180 gallons perminute (gpm).<T3>Cooling Tower Effects/Salt Drift</T3>_Cooling tower evaporation rateswould be equal to the consumptive water use rates, or a maximum of 180gpm. This incremental increase would not be expected to significantly increasefogging effects as related to operations at Harrisburg International Airport.Studies conducted in 1977, 1978 and 1980 indicated that no cooling towerdrift-related impact to the surrounding biota had occurred. Therefore,this incremental power level increase would not be expected to have anyimpact.<T3>Meteorology</T3>_Plume dispersion from the cooling towers will notchange becaues of this incremental power increase since this increase isso small and other factors are more controlling. Increased buoyancy ofgaseous releases from increased stack temperatures will not occur becausethe stack temperature increase will be insignificant.<T3>Impingement/Entrainment of Fish</T3>_Impingement and entrainment ofadult, juvenile and larval fish were studied from 1974 through 1982. Thesestudies concluded that no significant impact resulted from operation ofthe TMI units. The proposed power increase is not expected to significantlyincrease the impingement and entrainment of fish.<T3>Chemical Impact from Liquid Discharge</T3>_The additional use of riverwater at TMI-1, due to the power increase, will not result in the dischargeof concentrations of chemicals in excess of that evaluated in the FES becausethe additional water is lost to evaporation. Therefore, the proposed powerincrease will not have any significant adverse effects on the aquatic environmentor impact the water quality of the Susquehanna River. <T3>Thermal Impact from Liquid Discharges</T3>_Computer modeling predictsan increase in temperature of 0.4anddegrees;F in the liquid effluent as aresult of the proposed power increase. This increase will not violate thelimits of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) issuedby the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Slight variations in the temperatureof effluents released to the environment may affect the composition ofmacroinvertebrate populations in the vicinity of the discharge. However,such population shifts, if any, are very localized and do not affect theoverall quality of the acquatic environment. The staff therefore concludes that the proposed power level increase willhave negligible non-radiological impacts. Alternatives to the Proposed Action The principal alternative to the proposed action would be to deny the licensee'srequest to raise licensed power level for TMI-1 to 2568 MWt. In this case,TMI-1 would continue to operate with a maximum power level of 2535 MWt.In Chapter XI of the FES, the staff presented a cost-benefit analysis ofthe environmental impacts of operation of TMI-1 compared to alternate methodsof generating electricity (e.g., burning of coal or oil). In the FES, thestaff concluded that the environmental benefit of generating electricityby nuclear fission (as compared to coal or oil) greatly outweigh the environmentalcost. Even considering significant changes in the economics of the altenativessince 1972, operation of TMI-1 at 2568 MWt would require only incrementaladditional yearly costs. These costs would be substantially less than thepurchase of replacement power or the installation of new electrical generatingcapacity. Therefore, the staff concludes at this time that generation ofan additional 10 MWe of electricity at TMI-1 is more cost beneficial froman environmental standpoint than generating 10 MWe by other means.Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredand evaluated in the TMI FES. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment,the NRC staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significanteffect on the quality of the human environment.
