The service said Friday the classified test was conducted Feb. 23at the White Sands, N.M., Missile Range using a laser that is beingtested both by the Navy and the ``Star Wars'' program.   The test was an extremely important one, the Navy said, because``for the first time a high-energy laser system successfully engagedand destroyed a ... missile flying low and fast in a cruise missileprofile.''   Never before had the laser been tested against a target flyingfaster than the speed of sound, the Navy said.   The laser ``destroyed a supersonic missile in a test designed toshow that a laser system could acquire, track and deposit enoughenergy on a supersonic target to destroy it,'' the Navy continued.   At the same time, the Navy released an unclassified videotape ofthe experiment. The tape shows the target missile flying across thedesert floor, then just a brief, sharp burst of light near its tipthat sends it out of control.   The laser used in the test, nicknamed MIRACL for Mid-InfraredAdvanced Chemical Laser, proved for the first time in the fall of1987 that it could shoot down a target flying below the speed ofsound. A jet-powered drone was used in those tests.   In the latest experiment, the laser was fired against an oldTALOS anti-aircraft missile that was flying more than two times thespeed of sound _ or roughly 1,500 miles per hour _ on a path meantto simulate that of an attacking cruise missile, the Navy said.   Unlike the Star Wars organization, which has been investigatingthe feasibility of laser weapons to shoot down ballistic nuclearmissiles in space, the Navy has been experimenting with MIRACL tosee if such a laser could reliably defend a warship against missileattack.   The Navy program is known as the Balanced Technology Initiative.</TEXT></DOC>
