The report, issued by the U.N.'s Asian Forum of Parliamentarianson Population and Development, estimated that the population hitthe 3 billion mark Wednesday at 12:47 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time(8:47 p.m. EDT Tuesday).   Seven babies are born every second in Asia, and the continentaccounts for about 60 percent of the global population, accordingto the forum, which represents 19 Asian countries.   ``The designation of a day marking the birth of the 3 billionthbaby in Asia is very symbolic,'' said Shigemi Kono, director ofJapan's National Institute of Population Problems. ``But Ipersonally think it is nonsense, because there is no way ofactually knowing when the 3 billionth baby was born.''   Among Asian countries, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan face themost serious population growth problems, Kono said.   U.N. figures show that India, with 818 million people, has anannual population growth rate of 2.08 percent. Pakistan, with apopulation of 115 million, has a 3.45 percent growth rate and the110 million population of Bangladesh is growing at a 2.67 percentrate, according to the United Nations. By the year 2025, Asia willhave 4.5 billion inhabitants, according to the Tokyo-based AsianPopulation and Development Association _ roughly equal to theincrease in the total world population from 1950 to 1980.   The world population passed the 5 billion mark in July 1987,according to the United Nations.</TEXT></DOC>
