L. 99-603, provides lawful residence in the UnitedStates for ``special agricultural workers'' (SAWs). Aliens adjusted underthis section are not required to remain in agricultural work upon acquiringlawful status. To address the concerns of growers that labor shortagesmight result as alien farm workers granted status under the SAW programretired or left to go into non-agricultural work, Congress also added section210A to the Act. Unlike SAWs, these replenishment agricultural workers(RAWs) are obligated to perform seasonal agricultural services in eachof the first three years after having been accorded temporary residence.RAWs who fulfill this condition may be given the status of permanent resident.A RAW who fails to perform the requisite seasonal agricultural servicesis deportable. RAWs who desire to become citizens of the United Statesare obligated to perform seasonal agricultural services in each of twoadditional years.Section 210A(c) of the Act directs the Attorney General to provide forthe admission or adjustment of aliens to lawful temporary resident statusin order to meet a shortage of workers to perform seasonal agriculturalservices. The number of aliens admitted or adjusted each fiscal year underthe provisions of section 210A(c), which is referred to as the ``shortagenumber'', is determined jointly by the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculturewith the Bureau of the Census from data collected during the prior fiscalyear. If the determination is made that there will be no shortage of workersin any year, no RAW shall be admitted or adjusted in that year unless theEmergency Procedure for Increase in Shortage Number at section 210A(a)(7)is implemented.On August 15, 1988, a notice of availability for public comment of a preliminaryworking draft of regulations to implement section 210A(c) was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 30685. The Service gratefully acknowledgesthe many comments it received from farm worker and grower representatives,members of Congress and others. The knowlege and expertise imparted bythe commentors were of considerable help to the Service in refining itsviews and many of the suggestions were adopted in drafting this proposal.These proposed regulations describe a procedure to be employed for theadmission or adjustment of RAWs during fiscal year 1990, if required, andthe standards and procedures governing all other aspects of the RAW program.Procedures for the admission or adjustment of RAWs during fiscal years1991 through 1993 will be promulgated by regulation at a later date.The basic eligibility criteria for RAW status for fiscal year 1990 shallbe: (1) A minimum age of 18 by October 1, 1989; (2) the performance ofat least 20 man days of agricultural work in the United States in any 12consecutive months during the period May 1, 1985 through November 30, 1988;(3) admissibility to the United States as an immigrant; and (4) certificationof ability and intent to perform the seasonal agricultural services requiredto maintain RAW status. Aliens who have entered the United States illegallysubsequent to November 6, 1986, will not be eligible. Priority considerationshall be given to aliens who meet these criteria and who are spouses orunmarried sons or daughters of aliens legalized under IRCA.The selection process shall proceed in two stages: (1) The establishmentof a list of potentially eligible aliens who will be invited to petitionfor RAW status; and (2) the petition process during which eligibility willbe determined and the admission or adjustment of the alien accomplished.The shortage number for fiscal year 1990 may not be known until late infiscal year 1989 and it is possible that there will be no shortage number.The regulations are designed, therefore, to minimize the expenditure ofpublic funds in preparation for the admission or adjustment of RAWs priorto information that there will be a shortage number. In order that registrationprocedures may proceed prior to the beginning of fiscal year 1990, theService may commence action based on a formal estimate from the Departmentsof Agriculture and Labor as to the probable size of a shortage number,including a reasonable margin for a possible emergency increase prior toOctober 1, 1989.For reasons of economy and to avoid the creation of unwarranted expectationsthat would result from a registration out of proportion to the shortagenumber, registration standards will be variable and geared to the sizeof the shortage number as follows: (1) Immediately after the announcementor preliminary estimate of a shortage number by the Secretaries of theDepartments of Agriculture and Labor, the INS will establish a list ofaliens whose applications for SAW status were denied but who meet the eligibilitycriteria for RAW status. Age and qualifying work experience will be determinedfrom information already in possession of INS. Qualified registrants fromthis list will be the first to be admitted or adjusted to RAW status. Ifthe number of persons on this list is larger than the shortage number,there may be no need to activate additional procedures for the admissionor adjustment of RAWs. If, however, it appears likely that the number ofaliens on this list will not meet the shortage number, then the INS willimplement a procedure in which additional eligible aliens may registertheir interest in petitioning for RAW status. (2) if the difference betweenthe anticipated number of aliens in the first group and the shortage numberis less than 50,000, registration will be limited to eligible aliens residingin the United States whose qualifying work was in seasonal agriculturalservices; (3) if the difference is between 50,000 and 200,000, registrationwill be limited to eligible aliens residing in the United States whosequalifying experience was in any agricultural employment; and (4) if thedifference is greater than 200,000, registration will be open to any eligiblealien, including aliens outside the United States, whose qualifying workin the United States was in any agricultural employment. All timely received registration forms will be randomly ordered, with aliensclaiming priority consideration based on family relationship to an IRCAlegalized alien placed first on the registration list. If a shortage numberis determined, aliens in the first group will be invited to petition foradmission or adjustment to RAW status in the order that they appear onthe registration list until the shortage number is met. If the shortagenumber is not met by the first group, the appropriate additional registrationprocedure will be implemented. All registrants will mail their registrationforms (I-807) to an INS Central Processing Facility (CPF). Aliens claimingimmediate family relationship to an alien legalized under IRCA will begiven priority consideration. Registered aliens will be invited to petitionfor RAW status until the shortage number is met. Additional registrantswill be invited to petition as necessary to meet any emergency increasein the shortage number. It is in the interest of agricultural employers to remain in contact withundocumented former workers so that they may contact these workers withnecessary information in the event that there is a registration. The Service also wishes to note here that it is important for employersto understand that SAWs and RAWs are legal resident aliens and are to betreated as such for tax purposes. They should not be confused with nonimmigranttemporary workers admitted under the H-2A program. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigrationand Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a significantadverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Thisrule is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291,nor does this rule have federalism implications warranting the preparationof a Federal Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.
