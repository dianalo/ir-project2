The decline continues to reflect an unstable trend in the rigcount.   A year ago the count was 1,161, Baker Hughes said Monday.   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activityand it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as oflast Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the number of working rigs since 1940.   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig countreached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in therig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes begancompiling figures.   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.   Among major oil producing states, Kansas and Pennsylvania postedthe biggest gains in the most recent count with two additional rigs,followed by New Mexico and Wyoming, both up by one.   Oklahoma had the greatest decline with six fewer rigs, followedby Texas with four and Michigan with three. Colorado, North Dakotaand Ohio each reported one fewer rig this week while California andLouisiana were unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
