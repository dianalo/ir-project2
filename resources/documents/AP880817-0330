According to the Institute's Monthly Statistical Report,deliveries of petroleum products, a key measure of demand, fell 2.3percent to an average 16.7 million barrels a day when compared withyear-ago figures.   ``Despite continued growth in both the economy and in highwaytravel, July's limp gasoline deliveries ... continued the no-growthpatternof the second quarter,'' the Washington-based institute said.   But API noted that deliveries strengthened consistently as themonth progressed, ``indicating fairly healthy deliveries bymonth-end.''   Domestic crude oil production fell 1.2 percent from the year-agoperiod to an average 8.2 million barrels a day.
