However I regret that he failed to examine whether Soviet foreign policy, at least in Europe, may quite similarly also have outlived its time.    Thus he takes for granted that the Soviets would not even consider reducing or eliminating (he calls it &quot;surrendering&quot;) their conventional superiority. However, it is hardly clear to me, and no longer may be clear to the Soviets, whether the strategic benefits of this superiority come anywhere near the obvious costs.    Surely the Warsaw Pact does not imagine a large-scale conventional invasion by NATO forces. Since the Germans launched their massive invasion of Soviet Russia in 1941, surveillance techniques have reached a stage where a large-scale drive westward by Warsaw Pact forces well may be impossible. If the real purpose of the conventional superiority is to prevent any revolts in the satellites, surely these nations themselves are hardly an economic benefit to the Soviet Union.    In summary given the right concessions -- e.g., neutralization of a reunified Germany, abandonment of Star Wars, ending the embargo on advanced technologies, Western investment -- the Soviet Union well might agree to &quot;surrendering&quot; its conventional superiority on the European continent.
