A ministry statement said the two planes were among six Afghanaircraft that intruded in Pakistani airspace with the aim ofbombing targets here.   ``Search for the wreckage is in progress for final confirmation(that the two planes were destroyed),'' the statement said, addingthat all Pakistani planes returned safely.   The ministry said, ``Six Afghan aircraft on Monday violated theborder of Pakistan, north of Nawagai in the North West Frontierprovince with the intent of bombing our territory.'' Nawagai is 120miles northwest of Islamabad, and 12 miles from the Afghan border.   ``Two Pakistan air force F-16 aircraft intercepted the raidersand engaged two of the Afghan aircraft with air-to-air missiles athigh altitude.   ``All video and electronic sensors on board the F-16s indicatepositively that the two intruders were hit by missiles.''   The statement gave no further details.   Pakistan also claimed last Wednesday to have downed an intrudingAfghan plane after several Afghan warplanes were engaged byPakistani F-16s. The ministry also put the scene of the engagementthen as Nawagai. But state-run Radio Kabul called the Pakistaniclaim ``baseless'' and ``a lie.'' It challenged Pakistan to producethe wreckage. Islamabad failed to do so.   If verified, the Wednesday and Monday claims would make a totalof six warplanes shot down by Pakistan since the guerrilla war inAfghanistan began.   Those include a Soviet-piloted Su-25 warplane which Pakistanshot down over its territory Aug. 4. The Soviet pilot, Col.Alexander Vladimirovich Rudskoi, was captured, but was handed overto the Soviet Embassy in Islamabad on Aug. 17.   Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have suffered since late1979, when Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan to supportAfghanistan's pro-Moscow government. Thousands of anti-communistguerrillas have fought the Soviet troops and Afghan forces sincethen. Moscow and Kabul accuse Pakistan, the United States and Chinaof aiding the guerrillas militarily.   Half of the 115,000 Soviet troops have left Afghanistan by thestipulated date of Aug. 15, under U.N.-brokered Geneva accordssigned last April 14. The remaining troops are to leave by nextFeb. 15.   Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States and the Soviet Unionsigned the accords as a step toward bringing peace in Afghanistan.   Earlier Monday, guerrillas were reported to have taken two keyborder garrisons in southeastern Afghanistan in a series ofcommunist defeats there. Guerrillas and Western diplomatic souncessaid the Kabul government moved thousands of troops to theprovincial capital of Kandahar to shore up defenses sagging fromweeks of guerrilla onslaughts.   ``Reports we have received concerning the regime's situation in(southeastern) Afghanistan indicate that the position of the regimeis deteriorating,'' said one Western diplomatic source in Islamabad.   The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Kandahar has long been seen as a key element in the insurgents'drive to capture provincial capitals as Soviet forces withdraw.   The guerrillas claim they overran the border garrison of SpinBoldak after a two-month siege last Friday, capturing many weaponsand large amounts of ammunition.   The following day, guerrillas claimed a similar victory fartherup the border at Khair Kot in Paktika province, also a key supplyroute.   The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, rejectall offers for a political settlement with the communists. Theyhave taken two provincial capitals this summer: Talogan in thenorth and Bamyan west of Kabul. They also briefly held the keynorthern city of Kunduz before heavy Soviet aerial bombardmentforced them to flee.   The guerrillas also repeatedly penetrated Kabul's fortress-likedefenses to launch a series of blistering rocket attacks in recentweeks.   On Sunday, a large car bomb exploded on a main shopping streetnear the Pakistan Embassy, killing 10 people and wounding about 40.</TEXT></DOC>
