Despite the exotic aura and inevitable controversy surroundingmost cutting-edge medical research, such mainstream organizationsas the March of Dimes are firmly in favor of pressing forward withgene therapies.   The recommendation from a National Institutes of Health advisorycommittee Monday involves allowing researchers to place geneticallyaltered cells in terminally ill cancer patients to help them betterjudge the success of ongoing experimental treatment that does notuse gene therapy directly.   ``If this protocol were to work, I'd expect that within six to12 months there could be a proposal to do a gene therapyexperiment,'' said Dr. William J. Gartland, executive secretary ofthe NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.   Although the panel's recommendation would have to be embraced byNIH Director James B. Wyngaarden and the Food and DrugAdministration before the experiments could be carried out,Gartland's remarks indicated that is likely to be forthcoming.   But because the panel split 16-5 on the question, Wyngaarden islikely to take several months to review the matter before makinghis own recommendation, said Gartland.   Gadfly Jeremy Rifkin has conducted a decade-long battle to getthe federal government to adopt safeguards on genetic research, buthe said Tuesday that he did not oppose the NIH committee's action.   ``I do not oppose this experiment,'' he said in a telephoneinterview. ``This experiment is a precursor to the first geneticengineering of a human being.''   It is that next step, he said, that ``has more profoundlong-term ethical implications than any technology in history.''   Rifkin, head of the Foundation on Economic Trends, renewed hiscall for the government to set up a permanent oversight mechanism _at NIH or elsewhere _ to deal on a case-by-case basis with eachpotential genetic engineering experiment as it comes up.   He said he does not automatically oppose all genetic therapy.   ``You want to find those things that work and accept them,'' hesaid. The key, he said, is ``we don't want the technology to rushahead of the social and ethical implications.''   Meanwhile, the March of Dimes is marking its 50th anniversaryyear with a plan to focus money and attention on gene therapy.   Opera star Beverly Sills outlined the program last November in aspeech to the National Press Club.   Miss Sills, general director of the New York City Opera andmother of two children with birth defects, acknowledged thatadvocating gene therapy is likely to be more controversial than thefoundation's successful fight against polio.   But she said that is largely because gene therapy is surroundedby ``much misconception.''   ``One fact must be made clear,'' she said. ``What we are talkingabout is fixing or replacing genetic material for the lifetime ofone desperately ill person.   ``The characteristics of the transplanted gene will not bepassed on to future generations. The goal of gene therapy is thatof any other medical treatment _ the reduction of suffering and therestoration of health in individual patients.''   The March of Dimes has helped finance genetic research for yearsand foundation President Charles L. Massey acknowledged that a mainpurpose of the campaign planned for the coming year will be to lendthe group's credibility to the potential of gene therapy.   ``Gene therapy is not yet a reality, but it will be, probablyfar sooner than expected only a year or so ago and the March ofDimes will be there,'' Miss Sills said last November.</TEXT></DOC>
