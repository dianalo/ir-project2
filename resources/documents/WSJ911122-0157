A congressionalproposal that might be merely a nuisance to a largecorporation can spell life or death to a small firm ifenacted into law. A subtle shift in an economic indicatorthat energizes a cross section of small business can sendpowerful ripples through the economy as a whole.   What are the political and economic issues that mostconcern entrepreneurs today? The Wall Street Journal's EugeneCarlson and Jeanne Saddler talked with two experts who spendmuch of their time thinking about that question.</LP><TEXT>   John Motley is director of federal government relationsfor the National Federation of Independent Business, a largesmall-business trade group in Washington, D.C. William C.Dunkelberg is chief economist of the NFIB, and dean of TempleUniversity's School of Business and Management. Here areexcerpts from their discussion:                                                                                                          What Motivates Entrepreneurs?                                                                                                          John Motley: One of the reasons that most people decide togo into small business is personal freedom. They can createsomething themselves -- something that, even if it is not aroaring financial success, is something that they have puttogether on their own and they're very proud of.   We really don't have very many frontiers left in thiscountry as a safety valve. Where we have our safety valve issort of an economic safety valve. People can improve theirlot in this country for themselves, for their families, fortheir future, by being successful in business.                                                                                                          William Dunkelberg: One of the questions we asked {NFIBmembers in a study} was: Why did you start your own business?And John characterizes things quite well. I think less thanone in five said to make more money. Everybody else was inthere for a whole lot of other reasons. &quot;I wanted to reallytake advantage of my own skills, I wanted to avoid workingfor others, I wanted to build something that I can leave, Iwanted to build an organization.&quot; There were just a whole lotof reasons, when you could have picked &quot;making more money&quot; asone of the choices.   What's even more interesting is to ask those same people,three years later, how has it played out? And for the mostpart the entrepreneurs said: &quot;It was a little tougher than Ithought it was going to be, but if I had to make that choiceagain, I'd go right ahead and do it again.&quot;   By the way, a number of these people got intoentrepreneurship through the mechanism we characterize as thenegative-push. That is, you got terminated in your currentjob. You might have thought about being a small-businessperson on and off, but you had a great job, a great pension.But when downsizing occurs, you're suddenly standing on thecorner through no choice of your own. So you say: &quot;Now that Idon't have that job anymore, maybe I'll get started up.&quot; AndI think maybe around one in 10 got in {that way}.                                                                                                          Coping With the Recession                                                                                                          Dunkelberg: The external environment is real critical. Thebest manager in Houston during the oil crisis couldn't makeit. The worst entrepreneur in New England {during theexpansion} made it because people just kept throwing money athim. You also have to distinguish an {entrepreneur's}failures from a personal point of view versus a social pointof view. It's very difficult personally if you fail. But froma social point of view, we really didn't lose anything. Wedidn't lose the entrepreneur. If they fail, they just doanother experiment until they find something that's sociallyvaluable.   That's why {communism} failed in Eastern Europe. They hadno clue as to whether they were doing a good job because theydidn't understand profits and prices. {In the U.S.},entrepreneurs come up with thousands of ideas which aplanning commission can't come up with. They try them, and ifthey work, the system knows how to support it.                                                                                                          Motley: I'll give you an example of what he's talkingabout. We have a very active NFIB member in South Carolinawho started a construction business -- a very, verysuccessful construction business. He specialized in buildingmotels, and at one time he had 400, 500 people working forhim all over the country. Well, guess what? The travelindustry and the real-estate-development industries are nowdown and out, and he's been having a very difficult time. Isaw him about six weeks ago, and he was down to 12 people.They were all going to take a month off so that he couldconserve his resources. And during that time, they were goingto learn as much about commercial construction as possible.And he was going to restart the business, so to speak, withthe capital he had left, and he just knew that he was goingto be able to go out and make it in commercial construction.                                                                                                          Small-Business Hiring                                                                                                          Dunkelberg: In the fourth quarter of 1990, {NFIB members}had a negative number when we looked at hiring. In the firstquarter we again fired more than we hired. In the secondquarter, we were net creators of jobs; we actually hired morepeople than we fired. It wasn't much -- like a 10th of anemployee per firm. To find that low a number for the secondquarter, you had to go all the way back to 1981. Usually we'dbe more like three 10ths or four 10ths in the second quarter.In the third quarter my guess is that it's going to be veryflat again.   The reason {layoffs} in the fourth and the first quartersweren't as large as they were, say, in the '80-82 period isthat about halfway through the expansion, I think our firmssaid: &quot;Four years of expansion, that's a record. So tomorrowthe recession will start.&quot; And they began managing their firmas if the recession would come tomorrow. It took anotherthree, four years to come, but at that point we had no excesslabor. It was tough on profits, though, because as soon asthe sales went away, there weren't any costs to cut. Then the{sales declines} dropped right to the bottom line for thesefirms. No profits were made.                                                                                                          Motley: One of the signals that we're going to be comingout of this recession {will be when small business startshiring}. That's because small businesses tend to be ratherflexible, and can react to changes in consumer spending inthe economy much more quickly. They will hire first and theywill hire faster, but they also let go of their employees{first and faster in a recession}. They tend to be a buffer.                                                                                                          Credit Crunch                                                                                                          Dunkelberg: One of many questions we ask {members} is: Wasit easier or harder to get your financing the last quarterthan the quarter before? That's a measure of whether monetarypolicies are tight or not.   In '74-75, we clearly had difficulty getting credit, and'80-82 was stunningly difficult. We had an incrediblepercent, like 35%, of our firms telling us it was harder toget their financing.   In '83, that had fallen all the way down to about 4% or5%. It has now worked its way up to about 12%, and it'sdrifting back down again. I mean, there's really no evidencethat we have a credit crunch. Now we have some ancillaryevidence. We have another set of questions we ask: What's themost important problem facing small business today? In the'70s, inflation got 50% of the votes. Then in the '80-82period about 40% of the votes went to credit availability andcredit problems. Both of those numbers have run around 5% forthe last two years.   The percentage of our firms borrowing on a regular basisis at a record low level. So I think what's happening is thepeople who are tyring to borrow money, which isn't very many,have real trouble getting money. We've built up firms -- likeyour gentleman's construction firm -- that need money, butbanks shouldn't give them money. In that sense, there's acredit crunch. If you have anything to do with real estate,you have a problem. And if you are in New England, you have aproblem. {But most places and businesses aren't experiencinga credit crunch.} I notice when this one dude in the Senateheld hearings on the credit crunch, he held them on twooccasions -- in Washington and Boston. How opportune. Go tothe Midwest. Go to California. Find out who has a creditcrunch.                                                                                                          Motley: {A lot of small businesses don't need as muchcapital these days} for two reasons. One, we basically wrunginflation out of the economy back in the '80s. No. 2, we hadsignificant personal and business tax cuts. A lot of smallfirms today are financing themselves out of earnings wherethey couldn't do that in the early '80s and they couldn't doit in the late '70s. They don't run to the bank every month.                                                                                                          Dunkelberg: Right now, I don't care how low the interestrate is, our people don't want to {borrow} because they haveexcess capacity anyway. If you buy new machines and makesomething, nobody will buy it. So even if the Fed went outand {lowered interest rates}, nothing would happen exceptthat we would create a tremendous amount of short-termliquidity which would scare the bond market and mortgagerates would go back up, which is what we really don't want tohappen.                                                                                                          Attitudes Toward Government                                                                                                          Motley: We represent a signficant portion of the anti-tax,anti-regulatory, anti-government sentiment in the country --you know, Main Street and American small business.   The only {Democrat} I can see right now who can make anysort of appeal to small businesses, and indeed he has triedto at least keep the lines of communication open, is{Arkansas Gov. Bill} Clinton. He comes from a state which hasa reputation for being small-business friendly.                                                                                                          The Small Business Administration                                                                                                          Motley: I think the SBA is a very important symbol to thesmall-business community. It's an important symbol thatgovernment cares for small business.   But the SBA is not at the heart of NFIB's public-policyagenda. Why? With the lowest percentage of our membersborrowing on a regular basis and absolutely no creditproblems out there, it doesn't touch a lot of small-businesspeople, especially our members, every day.   I think there's a real role for them to play in theprocurement area. I think it's very difficult for a smallbusiness to get the government to do business with them. Thegovernment likes to do business with larger entities. It'ssimpler. It's more cost effective from their standpoint.   But I think {the SBA} shouldn't be involved in themanagement-assistance area at all. The government does nothave enough money to provide management assistance to everysmall-business owner out there who is deficient in some area.So I think it's wasting its time and they should take that$60 million, $70 million and they should put it into helpingprovide procurement assistance rather than managementassistance.                                                                                                          The Congressional Agenda                                                                                                          Dunkelberg: A lot of {small businesses} have all kinds ofleave programs, health-care benefits. Nobody's opposed tothat. What we're opposed to is having everybody have to do itthe same way. What Congress is saying is, this is the way wewant everybody to do it. It doesn't matter whether it'seffective or not, whehter it's efficent, whether it violatespeople's rights to work together. We don't care if it'scostly or not. Why don't we care if it's costly? Because it'snot our money.                                                                                                          Motley: Parental leave is not going to be enacted into lawin this Congress. I don't think it will be enacted into lawwhile George Bush is president. We have enough votes tosustain the veto in the Senate.   I think we're going to get simplified payroll taxreporting passed in this Congress. The {Senate} Finance andthe {House} Ways and Means Committees and the IRS are in themood to fix it. The {General Accounting Office} is involved.There's a lot of behind-the-scenes interest, and I think it'sgoing to happen. What we're looking for is a threshold of$18,000 a quarter or $6,000 a month in payroll taxes. Ifyou're below those triggers, you would deposit once a month.If you're above, you'd deposit on Tuesdays and Thursdays.There could also be a &quot;look-back&quot; system: Your deposit isbased on your last quarter's record, so you don't have theuncertainity of what might happen to employment in thefuture.   I also predict that some form of significantsmall-business pension simplification will be enacted in thenext tax bill.   I think {Sen. Edward Kennedy's bill that requiresemployers to offer health insurance to their employees or paya tax that would finance a government health-insuranceprogram} is dead. I think the proposal from {Sen. LloydBentsen} may very well seize the middle ground and become thething that Congress and the president can agree upon. TheBentsen bill has a great many things the small-businesscommunity wants -- 100% deductability for health-insurancepremiums for the self-employed; demonstration projects insome states allowing small businesses to pool their resourcesto purchase health insurance; pre-emption of state mandates;and the meager beginnings of some cost-control elements. It'sall positive and no negative.   There's also some very interesting stirrings in theadministration on the Bentsen bill. It's not being rejectedout of hand. That's significant. If the administration istaking a look at it, and {House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski} wants to move forward, it seems tome there's a real chance to do something good for smallbusiness by the middle of next year. It would also defusehealth insurance as a campaign issue for '92 and put it onthe agenda of doable things.</TEXT></DOC>
