In a statement broadcast yesterday by state-run RadioBaghdad, Iraq warned that it would destroy Middle East oilfields and include Israel in an all-out war if the West triedto &quot;strangle the people of Iraq.&quot; The statement, which wasmonitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, by wire services, said: &quot;Theoil areas in Saudi Arabia and in other states of the region,all the oil installations, will be rendered incapable,&quot; and&quot;Israel will be transformed into something different fromwhat they are now.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James Baker, yesterday onNBC's &quot;Meet The Press,&quot; reiterated that the U.S. ruled outany diplomatic compromise regarding United Nationsresolutions demanding that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait andrestore its government.   In fact, Mr. Baker noted that he will be joining otherforeign ministers of the five permanent members of the U.N.Security Council tomorrow to consider a further tightening ofsanctions against Iraq by imposing an air embargo. He saidthat the U.S. had nothing to negotiate about with Baghdad andthat only after Iraq complies fully with the U.N. resolutions&quot;then you might see some discussions between Kuwait and Iraq&quot;about their differences.   At the same time, Mr. Baker said, &quot;I don't think we'rerunning out of nonmilitary-type sanctions,&quot; to the Gulfcrisis.   Mr. Baker also said that while the U.S. would continue towork with the U.N., one exception might be if there were anIraq-sponsored terrorist attack against Americans. In thiscase, he implied, the administration would make &quot;anappropriate response&quot; on its own.   The arms sale to Saudi Arabia would be the first phase ofwhat the administration hopes would be a $20 billion package.The administration bowed to congressional pressure and splitthe package when some legislators, led by pro-Israel members,complained that Saudi Arabia didn't need all the weaponsimmediately and that such a mammoth sale would threaten thequalitative military edge that the U.S. has guaranteed tomaintain for Israel. Among items the Pentagon is likely topush to send quickly are TOW anti-tank missiles, which mightbe needed in a fight with Iraq, U.S. officials say.   The most high-profile items the administration wants tosell to Saudi Arabia, including M-1 tanks and 24 F-15 Eaglefighters, are likely to be put off until the second phase,which would be submitted to Congress in January or February,U.S. officials said. The overall package also would includePatriot Air Defense Missiles and more than 40 tank-killingApache helicopters.   A Saudi official said his government &quot;is confident we willget the entire package in the long run.&quot;   Separately, Saudi Arabia over the weekend ordered severaldiplomats from Jordan, Yemen and Iraq to leave the country,asserting that they were involved in spying for Baghdad andhelping to prepare for possible terrorism. The expulsionsreflect the deep rift in the Arab world between thosesympathetic to Iraq and the Persian Gulf states that feelthreatened by Saddam Hussein. U.S. officials say that PersianGulf leaders have refused to send any money to Jordan tocompensate for its losses as a result of the internationaleconomic sanctions against Iraq, which Jordan insists it ishonoring.   Saudi Arabia also has stepped up pressure on its Southernneighbor, Yemen, to support the embargo against Iraq. Saudiofficials have withheld millions of dollars of aid theyroutinely would have supplied to Yemen in recent weeks. TheSaudi government also withdrew special privileges thatallowed some 750,000 Yemen citizens to work and own propertyin the kingdom.   Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein appealed directly to theAmerican people, in an address broadcast on the Cable NewsNetwork, to support a peaceful resolution of theconfrontation with Iraq. King Hussein asserted that he hasnever accepted Iraq's right to invade Kuwait but believedthat Iraq could be persuaded to leave shortly after theinvasion. That chance, he implied, was lost when Saudi Arabiainvited U.S. troops to the kingdom in large numbers.   In Washington, the administration, which has hadwidespread domestic support for its responses to Iraqiaggression, is being criticized for taking too soft a linetoward Saddam Hussein in the weeks before the Augustinvasion. Yesterday, Mr. Baker said, &quot;I'm not going to denywhat the policy was,&quot; but he complained that &quot;now we've gotsome 20-20 hindsighting going on.&quot;   Mr. Baker defended some State Department officials,including the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, whotold Saddam Hussein the U.S. wouldn't get involved ininter-Arab disputes. But at the same time, he appeared to bedistancing himself from direct responsibility for some ofAmbassador Glaspie's actions. He said, &quot;probably 312,000cables, or so&quot; go out under his name each year, implying thathe didn't have direct knowledge of the instructions sent toMs. Glaspie before her July meeting with Saddam Hussein.   ---   Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
