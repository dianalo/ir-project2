(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Paula MusichandM;Racal-Milgo has combined the functions of LAN bridges and routers in a newcommunications device that company officials claim offers two industryfirsts: use of a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor androuting at the Media Access Control (MAC) layer.andM;LanNet Express combines the sub-LAN connection capabilities of a bridge withthe remote, wide area links offered by traditional routers.andP;  The product willprovide local and remote LAN-to-LAN links initially for IEEE 802.3 Ethernetnetworks and later for IBM Token-Ring networks, said Joseph Rosenthal, vicepresident of strategic planning and marketing for the Sunrise, Fla.,andO;data-communications firm.andM;While most routers operate at the network, or third, layer of the OpenSystems Interconnect communications model, LanNet Express provides MAC-layerrouting at the data link, or second, layer, said Rosenthal, who is based inAlpharetta, Ga.andM;Routing at that layer allows the device to work with LANs running diverseprotocols, including TCP/IP, Xerox Network Services, Open SystemsInterconnect and DECnet protocols.andM;Racal-Milgo chose Advanced Micro Devices' RISC chip as the on-board processorfor LanNet Express to boost the product's processing power, Rosenthal said.andO;The unit offers filtering rates of 75,000 packets per second and forwardingrates of 30,000 packets per second.andP;  Other routers use less powerfulprocessors, such as Motorola Inc.'s 68000.andM;LanNet Express supports as many as six LAN ports and 12 wide area networkports.andP;  The wide area ports support T-1, fractional T-1, T-3 and othertransmission media, providing data rates from 9.6K bps to 2.048M bps.andM;LanNet Express, available 90 days after receipt of order, is priced at $5,890for a base system.andP;  Typical configurations will range from $14,000 to$25,000, according to company officials.andM;Racal-Milgo can be contacted at (305) 846-1601.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
