About 500 radical students hurling firebombs fought riot policein front of Seoul's Kunkook University.   Students threw hundreds of firebombs as a police armored vanwith a multiple tear-gas launcher blasted volleys of gas bombs intothe mob of protesters during the hour-long clash.   Some 200 students battled riot police in a similar demonstrationin the southern city of Chonju at Wonkwang University after theywere blocked from marching into the streets, police said.   About 300 students took part in a peaceful anti-American protestat Chosun University in the southern city of Kwangju, they said.   The protests came as police said six radical students had beenarrested in connection with the brutal torture death of a fellowstudent suspected of being a police spy.   Roh was scheduled to meet today with Bush at the White House.   The National Police Headquarters said police were on heightenedalert for anti-American protests during Roh's visit to Washingtonthis week. Security was bolstered at U.S. facilities after anattack on U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg's residence on Friday.   During a rally before the fighting in Seoul, a five-foot effigyof Gregg was torched as students chanted ``Punish Gregg!'' Noarrests or injuries were reported.   The student militants are calling for Gregg's recall, saying hehelped to support military rule when he was CIA station chief inSeoul in the 1970s.   They also demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops based inSouth Korea and an end to U.S. demands for greater access to SouthKorean markets.   Six radical students climbed over a stone wall to break into theambassador's residence on Friday. They hurled homemade bombs atguards and rampaged through Gregg's home with iron bars, smashingartwork and windows before being overpowered by police firing teargas.   Gregg and his wife escaped unharmed and left soon afterwards forWashington to take part in the Roh-Bush talks. Radicals anddissidents, a small but powerful minority, have little supportbecause of their violent tactics.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said U.S. officials were conferringwith Korean police to determine how security around U.S. facilitiescould be upgraded to prevent future attacks.   Police said the body of Sol In-jong was found Sunday in thestudent council office at Seoul's Yonsei University, laid on afolding bed and wrapped in a brown blanket.   Officers said he had been tied to a chair, tortured and beatento death.   A police spokesman, requesting anonymity in keeping withofficial practice, said six students reported the killing andturned themselves in Sunday after confessing to a Roman Catholicpriest.   Two of the six students allegedly administered the beatings,police said.   The six students told police they discovered Sol carried a fakeuniversity identification card after he gained entrance to theirradical student club and they suspected him of being a spy for thenational security police, a police spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
