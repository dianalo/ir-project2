(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Disgruntled Republicans, upset over thedisqualification of 968 would-be delegates, disrupted Friday'sopening session of the Georgia GOP convention by chanting ``no, no,no'' and parading around the hall carrying placards.   Many of the protesters were supporters of Pat Robertson'spresidential candidacy, but there were also supporters of VicePresident George Bush, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and Sen. Bob Doleof Kansas.   Meanwhile, party officials refused to register any of theestimated 1,600 people attending the convention at the Albany CivicCenter.   State Republican Chairman John Stuckey told the crowd the partywas barred from officially seating any delegates until thecredentials committee had issued its report on the disqualifieddelegates.   ``I can't proceed with registration until I know who is adelegate,'' he said. ``I am acting on the advice of counsel. Idon't intend to register anybody.''   The credentials committee began the court-ordered review processFriday morning, just hours before the convention opened. Supportersof Pat Robertson's presidential candidacy boycotted the reviewprocess, however, saying they would attempt to seat their owndelegates.   Stuckey called the convention to order about 2 p.m. amid boos.On two occasions when party leaders were speaking, many of those onthe floor of the convention hall stood up and shouted.   The dispute was over a May 11 letter sent by the credentialscommittee to 968 of the delegates elected at county conventions,informing them they had been disqualified as delegates to the stateconvention.   Most were rejected because local party officials had notprovided evidence that the county conventions were advertised innewspapers. Many of the disqualified delegates charged that thattechnicality had never been used before.   A major order of business at the two-day convention is theelection of the final 18 of the state's 48 delegates to theRepublican National Convention in New Orleans. All 48 are committedto vote for Bush on the first two ballots at the August conventionbecause the vice president swept Georgia's GOP presidentialprimary. But Robertson supporters are seeking to attend, hopingthey can influence selection of the vice presidential candidate andthe party platform.</TEXT></DOC>
