The Commission makes this proposalbecause of the numerous applications that have been filed with the Commissionregarding mutual fund exchanges. The revised proposed rule is intendedto set forth the Commission's standards for most such exchanges and reducesignficantly the burden on the mutual fund industry of filing applications.The Commission is also seeking additional comment on a proposed rule thatwas previously issued for comment and that would permit a unit investmenttrust or its sponsor to make certain exchange offers to unitholders ofthe same trust or to unitholders of another unit investment trust havingthe same sponsor. The commenters on the original proposal raised severalissues. The Commission now seeks comment on alternatives to the proposaland on what further steps it should take in this area.Finally, the Commission is considering whether to propose amendments toan existing rule that permits certain insurance company separate accountsto make offers of exchange. Such amendments are being considered becauseissues now under consideration in the mutual fund and unit investment trustexchange areas also apply to separate accounts. The Commission is requestingcomment on insurance considerations relevant to the questions of whetherand how amendments to rule 11a-2 should be implemented.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments must be received on or before October 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Send comments in triplicate to Jonathan G.

Additionally, the Commission is askingfor public comment on certain matters pertaining to whether, and, if so,how, rule 11a-2 (17 CFR 270.11a-2) under section 11 of the Act (15 U.S.C.80a-11) should be amended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Summary</ITAG>In December 1986, the Commission proposed rules 11a-3 and 11c-1, whichwould permit certain exchange offers by registered open-end managementinvestment companies (``mutual funds'' or ``funds'') and unit investmenttrusts (``UITs''), other than registered separate accounts.\1\<NOTE/> The six commenters on the proposals generally supported theinitiative taken by the Commission, but argued that certain provisionsof the proposed rules should be modified or eliminated. As discussed below,revised proposed rule 11a-3 reflects the comments received, as well asdevelopments occurring after issuance of the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See</T3> Investment Company Act Rel. No. 15494 (Dec. 23, 1986) [51FR 47260, Dec. 31, 1986] (``proposing release'').Revised proposed rule 11a-3 would permit, subject to specified conditions,a mutual fund or its principal underwriter to make exchange offers to thatfund's shareholders (<T3>e.g.,</T3> in the case of a series company) or to shareholders of anotherfund in the same group of funds. As in the initial proposal, the revisedproposed rule would permit the imposition of an administrative fee anda sales load on the ``acquired security'' at the time of an exchange.\2\<NOTE/> In addition, also like the initial proposal, revised proposedrule 11a-3 would permit a deferred sales load on the acquired security.For purposes of calculating any sales load imposed on the acquired security,both proposals would require that an exchanging shareholder receive creditfor any sales load previously paid on the exchanged security and, in thecase of an acquired security subject to a contingent deferred sales load,for the length of time the shareholder held the exchanged security.\3\<NOTE/> Both proposals would also require disclosure of any administrativefee in the prospectus of the offering company and in certain sales literatureand advertising.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The introductory language in the revised proposal hasbeen modified to clarify that the rule is intended to permit only the impositionof certain charges at the time of an exchange, and not to approve all ofthe other terms of an exchange offer.<ITAG tagnum="28">The ``acquired security'' is the security of the offering companythat an investor acquired in an exchange.</ITAG><T3> See</T3> revised proposal rule 11a-3(a). ``Sales load'' is definedin section 2(a)(35) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(35)]<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Revised proposed rule 11a-3(c)(3) would define the term``exchanged security'' to include the security actually exchanged underan exchange offer, and any security previously exchanged for the securityactually exchanged or for any of its predecessors.The revised proposal contains several changes from the initial proposal.First, the revised proposed rule states that an offering company that haspreviously made an exchange offer cannot rely on the rule to change theterms of such prior offer unless that company's prospectus had disclosed,at all times the offer was outstanding, that the offer was subject to terminationand that its terms were subject to change, unless the only effect of thechange is to reduce or eliminate a charge payable at the time of the exchange.Second, the revised proposal would define the term ``administrative fee''and permit the imposition of a redemption fee on the exchanged securityat the time of an exchange. The intention to impose a redemption fee wouldalso have to be disclosed in certain sales literature and advertising.Third, the revised proposed rule would expressly prohibit the impositionof a deferred sales load on the exchanged security at the time of an exchange.Such a prohibition was merely implicit in the original proposal. Fourth,the revised proposal would expand and relabel the ``family of funds'' conceptcontained in the original proposal. Fifth, the revised proposed rule wouldrequire any offering company that reserves the right to change the termsof or terminate its exchange offer to disclose in its prospectus and incertain advertising and sales literature that the offer may be terminatedand that its terms are subject to change. Finally, the revised versionwould require that shareholders by given prior notice of any material amendmentto the terms of an exchange offer, unless the only effect of the amendmentis to reduce or eliminate a charge payable at the time of the exchange.Reproposed rule 11a-3 would be prospective in effect and is intended toset forth for the entire fund industry the Commissions standards for approvalof exchange offers at other than relative net asset value. Therefore, whenadopted, rule 11a-3 will supersede all prior Commission orders that approvedexchange offers at other than relative net asset value. Recipients of suchprior orders should avail themselves of the comment process on rule 11a-3,if they so desire.The Commission is also requesting additional public comment on proposedrule 11c-1. Proposed rule 11c-1 would permit, subject to certian conditions,a UIT or its sponsor to make certain exchange offers to unitholders ofthe same trust or another UIT having the same sponsor. Because of concernsraised by the commenters, the Commission is requesting additional commenton whether and how it should proceed with a rulemaking initiative in thisarea.Finally, the Commission is considering whether to propose amendments torule 11a-2, which permits, under certain conditions, offers of exchangeby registered separate accounts. The Commissionis asking for public commenton insurance considerations relevant to proposing amendments to the rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Section 11(a) of the Act provides that unless an exchange offer made bya mutual fund or its principal underwriter to the fund's own shareholders,or to the shareholders of another mutual fund, is made on the basis ofthe relative net asset values of the shares to be exchanged, the termsof the offer must first be approved by the Commission or comply with anyrules that the Commission may have prescribed. Section 11(c), by referenceto section 11(a), provides that the terms of <T3>any </T3>exchange offer involving the securities of a UIT must firstbe approved by the Commission or comply with any rules that the Commissonmay have prescribed.The legislative history of section 11 and the reasons for proposing rules11a-3 and 11c-1 are discussed thoroughly in Investment Company Act ReleaseNo. 15494 (December 23, 1986) (the ``proposing release''), and will notbe repeated here. In brief, proposed rule 11a-3 would have permitted amutual fund or its principal underwriter to make certian exchange offersto that fund's shareholders or to shareholders of another fund in the samefamily of funds. Proposed rule 11c-1 would have permitted a UIT or itssponsor to make certian exchange offers to unitholders of the same UITor to unitholders of another UIT having the same sponsor.In response to proposed rule 11a-3, five of the six commenters generallyexpressed support for the initiative, but argued that certian provisionsshould be modified or clarified.\4\<NOTE/> Moreover, other developments have come to light that indicatea need for modification of the original proposal. Specifically, some fundfamilies that have a liberal exchange policy may experience a heavy volumeof exchanges to the detriment of shareholders remaining in certain funds.Excessive exchange activity may increase fund expenses \5\<NOTE/> and force portfolio managers to maintain a large cash positionto meet possible redemptions due to exchanges.\6\<NOTE/> Recently, several funds have imposed new restrictions ontheir exchange privileges and other funds may follow suit.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In addition to the comment letters received, a representativeof one of the commenters met with several representatives of the Commission'sDivision of Investment Management. A memorandum submitted by the commenterafter that meeting and a staff memorandum discussing the meeting were placedin the public comment file on the proposed rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For example, funds may be required to liquidate assets,thereby incurring brokerage commissions. <T3>See </T3>discussion of redemption fees, <T3>infra, </T3>at notes 37-45 and accompany text.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See Managers Closely Watch Redemptions, </T3>Wall St. J., Oct. 27,1987, at 41, col. 1; <T3>Fidelity Sector Funds Sustain Big Hits, </T3>Wall St. J., Oct. 23,1987, at 45, col. 1.The imposition of restrictions on existing exchange privileges, however,raises its own set of problems. While such restrictions may benefit investorswho seldom, if ever, use exchange privileges, they may be unfair to thoseinvestors who bought shares in reliance on unlimited or free exchange privileges.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See Some Funds Act To Discourage Phone Switches, </T3>Wall St. J.,Feb. 8, 1988, at 27, col. 3; <T3>Fidelity Curbs Switching in Sector Funds, </T3>Wall St. J., Apr. 13,1987, at 45, col. 1.Also, in some applications received after the proposal of rule 11a-3, applicantshave sought permission to calculate the amount of a contingent deferredsales load (``CDSL'') imposed at the time an acquired security is redeemedin a manner that differs from that described in the vast majority of theapplications received prior to the proposal.\8\<NOTE/> Under almost all of the orders issued before proposed rule11a-3, any CDSL on the acquired security is calculated as if the acquiredsecurity were held from the date on which the exchanged security was acquired.\9\<NOTE/> Recently, however, where the exchanged security was subjectto a CDSL that would be deferred until redemption of the acquired security,and the acquired security was itself subject to neither a front-end salesload nor a CDSL, applicants have sought and received permission to excludethe time period during which the acquired security was held when calculatingthe CDSL charged when the acquired security was redeemed.\1\\0\<NOTE/> In light of these recent orders, and the other developmentsdiscussed above, the Commission has decided to repropose rule 11a-3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ A CDSL is a sales load that is paid by the shareholderat the time fund shares are redeemed and the amount of which varies withthe length of time the redeemed shares were held. The CDSL may be eliminatedentirely if redemption does not occur before a specified period of time.For instance, a typical CDSL might consist of a five percent charge onredemptions of shares made within one year of purchase. In each successiveyear, the percentage of the sales load would be reduced by one percent,with the result that a redemption of shares that had been held for morethan five years would not be subject to any sales load.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Freedom Investment Trust, et al., Investment CompanyAct Rel. Nos. 15075 (Apr. 28, 1986) [51 FR 16602, May 5, 1986] (noticeof application) and 15118 (May 28, 1986) (order). Proposed rule 11a-3(a)(3)would have required such tacking of the time an investor held both theexchanged and the acquired securities for purposes of calculating the CDSLon the acquired security.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Tucker Anthony Mutual Fund, et al., Investment CompanyAct Rel. Nos. 15708 (Apr. 28, 1987) [52 FR 16474, May 5, 1987] (noticeof application) and 15745 (May 19, 1987) (order). <T3>See also</T3> notes 33-36, <T3>infra,</T3> and accompanying text.Regarding proposed rule 11c-1, two commenters argued that it would be unworkableand a significant departure from the prior orders. As discussed in moredetail below, however, the commenters failed to suggest an alternativeapproach that would address adequately the concerns reflected in the legislativehistory of section 11. Therefore, the Commission has decided to seek additionalcomment on the proposed rule before taking further action.The Commission adopted rule 11a-2 in 1983 to permit certain exchange offersby registered separate accounts.\1\\1\<NOTE/> The rule defines who may make and receive those exchangeoffers, and permits the offering account to charge an administrative feeand, under certain conditions, a sales load at the time of an exchange.The Commission generally believes that, to promote competitive equalityamong investment company products, insurance company separate accountsand mutual funds should be subject to the same legal requirements in theexchange offer area. If revised proposed rule 11a-3 is adopted, therefore,the Commission intends to consider whether to propose amendments to rule11a-2 so that, to the extent possible, the two rules will contain similarprovisions. the Commission is now asking for comment on insurance considerationsrelevant to amending rule 11a-2.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 13407 (July 28, 1983) [48FR 3643, Aug. 10, 1983] (adopting release for rule 11a-2).<ITAG tagnum="28">Section 1(a)(37) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(37)] defines ``separateaccount'' as ``an account established and maintained by an insurance companypursuant to the laws of any State or territory of the United States, orof Canada or any province thereof, under which income, gains and losses,whether or not related, from assets allocated to such account, are, inaccordance with the applicable contract, credited to or charged againstsuch account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of the insurancecompany.'' ``Separate account'' is similarly defined in rule 0-1(e) underthe Act [17 CFR 270.0-1(e)] for purposes of the availability of certainexemptive rules, including rule 11a-2.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>A. Revised Proposed Rule 11a-3This section discusses provisions in the revised proposed rule that reflectchanges from the initial proposal, as well as provisions that have beenleft unchanged.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Effect of Revised Proposed Rule on Prior Orders</ITAG>In conjunction with the proposing release, the Commission issued a noticeproposing to amend fifty orders previously issued under the Act (the ``priororders'') to conform the prior orders to the proposed rule, when adopted.\1\\2\<NOTE/> The prior orders approve exchanges between mutual funds wherean administrative or other processing fee is imposed. The notice statedthat ``[a]ny interested person may request a hearing on amendment of aparticular Prior Order or ask to be notified if a hearing is ordered.''The Commission received responses covering six of the prior orders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ <T3>See</T3> Investment Company Act Rel. No. 15546 (Jan. 20, 1987) [52FR 2966, Jan. 29, 1987].The Commission has determined that it is not necessary to give individualhearings to the holders of the prior orders or to any other person. Thereis no need for such hearings because the reproposed rule would be prospectivein effect and is intended to set forth for the entire industry the Commission'sstandards for approval of exchange offers at other than relative net assetvalue. Moreover, all of the rule's provisions would apply, not just thosegoverning disclosure of administrative fees. Recipients of prior ordersmay make their views known in the context of the comment process that accompaniesCommission rulemaking, and those views will be given due consideration.\1\\3\<NOTE/> Similarly, holders of orders not involving administrativefees (<T3>e.g.,</T3> any other type of order regarding an exchange at other thanrelative net asset value) should avail themselves of the comment process,if they so desire.\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ <T3>But cf.</T3> section 40(a) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-39(a)] (the procedurefor the issuance of orders under the Act contemplates the opportunity forhearings on an individual basis).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Orders issued since the initial proposal have all beenconditioned specifically on compliance with rule 11a-3, when and if adopted.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Funds That May Rely on the Rule</ITAG>Revised proposed rule 11a-3 would provide specifically that any offeringcompany that has previously made an offer of exchange cannot rely on therule to amend the terms of such prior offer unless the prospectus of theoffering company had disclosed, at all times the offer was outstanding,that the offer was subject to termination and its terms were subject tochange.\15\<NOTE/> Revised proposed rule 11a-3 is intended to provide genericrelief from section 11 for many exchange offers made at other than relativenet asset value. Conditioning use of the rule on prior prospectus disclosurerecognizes that some funds with existing exchange privileges previouslyused those privileges in marketing fund shares, but may now wish to relyon the rule to change the privileges so as to restrict effectively theiruse. For example, such a fund may seek to impose an administrative chargeor redemption fee on an exchange, or increase an administrative chargepermitted by a prior order. Such changes may raise questions of fairnesswith respect to those shareholders who bought (and held) shares of thefund based, in part, on the existing terms of an exchange privilege. Thedegree of unfairness, in turn, depends partially on the past prospectusdisclosure and marketing of funds with such privileges.\16\<NOTE/> At least where there has been prior prospectus disclosurethat an exchange privilege may change there is some notice to investors.\17\<NOTE/> Accordingly, such past disclosure is a precondition to useof the rule.\18\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Paragraph (a)(1) would provide an exception to the priordisclosure requirement where the only effect of an amendment is to reduceor eliminate an administrative fee, sales load or redemption fee payableat the time of an exchange.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See </T3>notes 60-64, <T3>infra, </T3>and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The Commission is not requiring that funds use any particularlanguage for the necessary disclosure, but such disclosure should be clearand unambiguous.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Once rule 11a-3 is adopted, any fund that (i) proposesto restrict materially the terms of an exchange offer, (ii) would requirean order under section 11 after such amendment, and (iii) is unable torely on rule 11a-3, would be required to obtain an individual order (oran amended order, as appropriate) prior to changing the terms of the offer.In reviewing applications from such funds, the staff would use rule 11a-3,as adopted, as a guideline. The Commission would expect applicants to comply,to the extent possible, with the terms of rule 11a-3 and to demonstrateeither that existing shareholders who were not on notice that the termsof the offer could change would not be harmed by the amendment, or thatthe application includes conditions designed to mitigate any harm sufferedby such shareholders. Such conditions could include (i) permitting existingshareholders who were not on notice to continue to exchange their sharesunder the original terms of the exchange offer, (ii) allowing such shareholdersto redeem their shares within a specified period of time without paymentof any redemption fee or deferred sales load that would otherwise be applicable,or (iii) allowing such shareholders to redeem their shares and receivea total or partial refund of any front-end sales load previously paid.The Commission seeks comment, however, on whether it is necessary and appropriatethat final rule 11a-3 state that if the appropriate prospectus disclosurewas made at or before the time any investor acquired all of his shares,then the fund could rely on the rule as to that shareholder to amend anexchange offer. Alternatively, the Commission seeks comment on whetherit is necessary and appropriate that final rule 11a-3 state that if theprospectus disclosure was made for a particular number of years (<T3>e.g., </T3>2, 5, of 10 years), then the fund could rely on the ruleto amend an exchange offer.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Calculating the Sales Load Differential</ITAG>Revised proposed rule 11a-3 would permit exchanges of mutual fund shareson the basis of the relative net asset values of the securities to be exchangedplus the imposition of a sales load on the acquired security.\19\<NOTE/> Paragraph (a)(3) of the revised proposed rule would limitany sales load charged on the acquired security to a percentage that isno greater than the excess, if any, of the rate of the sales load applicableto that security in the absence of an exchange over the total rate of allsales loads previously paid on the exchanged security (the ``sales loaddifferential'').\20\<NOTE/> Additionally, paragraph (a)(3) of the revised proposal wouldlimit any sales load charged upon redemption of the acquired security,that is solely the result of a deferred sales load imposed on the exchangedsecurity, to a rate that is no greater than the excess, if any, of theapplicable rate of such sales load, calculated in accordance with paragraph(a)(5) of the rule, over the total rate of all sales loads previously paidon the acquired security.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ As initially proposed, rule 11a-3(a) would have permittedthe imposition of ``a nominal administrative fee or a sales load''. Threecommenters asked that the final rule clearly state that it permits botha nominal administrative fee and a sales load to be charged. The revisedproposed rule would permit either or both of these charges and would alsopermit the imposition of a redemption fee at the time of an exchange. Inresponse to the commenters, revised proposed rule 11a-3 specifically statesthat any combination of the permitted charges may be imposed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Thus, paragraph (a)(3) would permit a sales load to becharged on the acquired security only if the percentage rate of the salesload otherwise applicable to that security exceeds the combined percentagerates of <T3>all </T3>sales loads previously paid by the shareholder on the exchangedsecurity.The proposed rule would have also used a sales load differential approachto limit the maximum sales load that could be charged on the acquired security.However, the proposal did not specify whether the offering company shouldcalculate the differential by reference to the difference between the <T3>rates </T3>of the sales loads or the difference between the <T3>amounts </T3>of the sales loads. One commenter pointed out that theprevailing industry practice is to calculate the differential by referringto the rates, rather than to the amounts. The same commenter also pointedout that rule 11a-2, relating to offers of exchange involving insurancecompany separate accounts, permits the sales load differential to be calculatedby reference to the difference in rates.\21\<NOTE/> Thus, the revised proposal is intended to bring the proposedrule into conformance with both rule 11a-2 and current industry practice.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>rule 11a-2(c)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Of course, this change is based on the assumption thatthe maximum sales load rates of the exchanged and acquired securities areexpressed in the same terms, <T3>e.g., </T3>as a percentage of the public offering price or as a percentageof the net amount invested. If the maximum sales loads are not generallycalculated using comparable rates, the sales load differential would haveto be calculated by first expressing both rates in a similar manner.<ITAG tagnum="28">Consistent with the change reflected in paragraph (a)(3) of the revisedproposed rule, paragraph (a)(11)(i) also has been amended to specify thatwhere a securityholder exchanges less than all of his securities, the securitythat is deemed exchanged first should be determined by reference to thesecurity upon which the highest sales load </ITAG><T3>rate </T3>was previously paid.The proposal did not specifically address the situation where the exchangedsecurity is subject to a deferred sales load and the acquired securityis subject to a front-end sales load. The revised proposal would permitthe imposition of the front-end sales load at the time of exchange, butthe deferred sales load for the security originally purchased (<T3>i.e. </T3>the exchanged security) could not be imposed until the shareholderredeems the acquired security. The proviso to paragraph (a)(3) would providethat, where a deferred sales load imposed at the time the acquired securityis redeemed is solely the result of a deferred sales load imposed on theexchanged security, the rate of such sales load may not exceed a salesload differential calculated using the total rate of all sales loads previouslypaid on the acquired security. The crediting of any front-end sales loadon the acquired security, when determining the amount of the original deferredload that is still owed, is consistent with the other aspects of the revisedproposal and with the purposes of section 11.Finally, where a shareholder exchanges less than all of his securities,revised proposed rule 11a-3 would provide that in calculating any salesload charged on the acquired security, the security upon which the highestsales load rate was previously paid should be deemed exchanged first. Anorder of redemption provision is necessary because of the high degree ofcontrol that a fund may have over the order in which shares are redeemedupon an exchange, and the fact that a fund's principal underwriter maybenefit if shares are redeemed in an order that results in a higher salesload.\2\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ Under both the initial and the revised proposals, wherethe exchanged security was acquired through reinvestment of dividends orcapital gains distributions, that security would be deemed to have beensold with a sales load equal to the sales load previously paid on the securityon which the dividend was paid or distribution made. One commenter suggestedthat rule 11a-3 should require that any exchanged security acquired throughreinvestment of a dividend or capital gains distribution would not be subjectto any sales load upon an exchange. The Commission seeks specific commenton whether final rule 11a-3 should require that any share acquired throughsuch reinvestment not be subject to any sales load upon any exchange. Itshould be noted that the revised proposal would not preclude such a waiverof sales load on those shares. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Deferred Sales Load on the Exchanged Security </ITAG>Revised proposed rule 11a-3 would prohibit specifically the impositionof a deferred sales load on any exchanged security at the time of an exchange.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Permitting a deferred sales load to be imposed at the timeof an exchange could raise problems of the type with which section 11 isconcerned. Even if a shareholder received credit for paying such a salesload against any sales load otherwise payable on the acquired security,there may be an enhanced incentive to engage in switching. Inducing anexchange would trigger payment of a deferred sales load, thereby permittingthe fund's principal underwriter to receive payment of a sales load earlierthan would otherwise be the case. Moreover, there would appear to be nocorresponding benefit to the shareholder from the accelerated payment ofthe sales load.\2\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ The definition of ``deferred sales load'' in the revisedproposal differs slightly from that in the proposal. The definition wasrevised only to track section 2(a)(35) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(35)]and is not intended to have any substantive effect on the rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ In falling market, a principal underwriter could havean even greater incentive to induce an exchange becuase of CDSL is generallycalculated based on a percentage of the lesser of the original purchaseprice or current net asset value. Thus, the exchange would affect the amount,not just the timing, of the deferred sales load. Rule 11a-3, as originally proposed, would not have authorized the impositionof a deferred sales load on the exchange security. This lack of authorizationwas the result of several prior orders in which the applicants representedthat such a deferred sales load would not be imposed.\2\\6\<NOTE/> However, the commenters on the proposed rule generally favoredpermitting a deferred sales load to be imposed on the exchanged securityand urged the Commission to clarify this aspect of the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Freedon Investment Trust, Investment Company Act Rel.Nos. 15075 (Apr. 28, 1986) [51 FR 16602, May 5, 1986] (notice of application)and 15118 (May 28, 1986) (order); MetLife-State Street Investment Trust,et al., Investment Comany Act Rel. Nos. 14940 Feb. 13, 1986 [51 FR 6338,Feb. 21. 1986] (notice of application) and 14986 (Mar. 13, 1986) (order).In support of their position, the commenters argued that there is no reasonto prohibit the imposition of a deferred sales load on the exchanged security,as long as the shareholder receives credit for that load against any salesload otherwise payable on the acquired security.\2\\7\<NOTE/> They also argued that imposing a deferred sales load at thetime of an exchange, rather than upon the ultimate redemption of the acquiredsecurity, would ease the administrative and recordkeeping burden of thefunds involved in the exchange.\2\\8\<NOTE/> Further, the commenters maintained that, if no deferred salesload was permitted at the time of an exchange, an investor could easilyavoid paying a deferred sales load simply by exchanging securities subjectto such a load for shares of a ``no-load'' fund, and then redeeming theshares of the ``no-load'' fund. Finally, one commenter argued that it wouldbe unfair to prohibit mutual funds from imposing a deferred sales loadon the exchanged security when rule 11a-2 permits certain registered separateaccounts to do so. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ One commenter pointed out that paragraph (a)(2) ofproposed rule 11a-3 would have literally required such a credit. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ One commenter maintained that transferring shareholderrecords between funds with different transfer agents places a heavy administrativeburden on the funds involved. The commenters' arguments in favor of permitting a deferred sales loadto be charged on the exchanged security at the time of an exchange areunpersuasive for several reasons. First, as discussed above, merely givena credit for a deferred sales load imposed at the time of an exchange doesnot eliminate the potential for switching. Second, it is not necessary true that, as argued, if a deferred sales loadcould not be imposed, investors could easily avoid paying any sales loadby exchanging into a ``no-load'' fund. Neither the initial nor the revisedproposal would prohibit any deferred sales load to which the exchangedsecurity was subject to be imposed when the investor redeems the acquiredsecurity.\2\\9\<NOTE/> This is true even where the acquired security is not otherwisesubject to a sales load.\3\\0\<NOTE/> Therefore, an investor could not avoid paying a deferredsales load unless the offering company has structured the offer of exchangeto permit such a practice. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ Although revised proposed rule 11a-3 would not prohibitthat practice, it should be noted that paragraph (a)(5), with a limitedexception, would require that any sales load imposed upon redemption ofthe acquired security be calculated as if the holder of the acquired securityheld it from the date on which he became the holder of the exchanged security.<T3>See </T3>notes 33-36, <T3>infra,</T3> and accompanying text. Therefore, if payment of a CDSLon the exchange security occurs when the acquired security is redeemed,the shareholder must be given full credit for both the time the exchangedsecurity was held and the time the acquired security was held. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\\9\ For example, suppose a shareholder initially purchasesshares of a fund subject to a CDSL (``Fund A''). He then exchanges thoseshares for shares of a no-load fund (``Fund B''), without the impositionof any CDSL at the time of the exchange. Upon the subsequent redemptionfrom Fund B, such shares would be subject to the CDSL of Fund A. Unlessthe limited exception contained in the proviso to paragraph (a)(5) of therevised proposal were applicable, for purposes of calculating that charge,the shareholder's holding period would be deemed to include the entireperiod during which shares of both funds were held by the shareholder.This treatment is consistent with most orders. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Eaton Vance California Municipals Trust, et al,. InvestmentCompany Act Rel. Nos. 15829 (June 26, 1987) [52 FR 25105, July 2, 1987](notice of application) and 15893 (July 24, 1987) (order).Third, in response to the argument that rule 11a-3 should permit the impositionof a deferred sales load on an exchanged security because certain insurancecompany separate accounts are permitted to do so, the Commission wishesto point out that rule 11a-2 does not permit separate accounts to imposea deferred sales load on the exchanged security at the time of the exchange.\3\\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ The proposing release for rule 11a-2 stated: ``[T]heproposed rule does not permit a contingent derferred sales load to be imposedupon the redemption of the exchanged security in connection with the exchangeoffer.'' Investment Company Act Rel. No. 12675 (Sept. 20, 1982) [47 FR42374, Sept. 27, 1982] at n. 17. Revised proposed rule 11a-3's prohibitionof the imposition of a deferred sales load on an exchanged security atthe time of an exchange would help promote competitive equality betweenmutual funds and insurance company separate accounts. <T3>See</T3> note 82, <T3>infra,</T3> and accompanying text. Finally, while permitting the imposition of a deferred sales load at thetime of exchange may ease somewhat the administrative and recordkeepingburden on the funds involved in an exchange, almost none of the applicantsfor approval of exchange offers under section 11(a) have sought permissionto impose such a sales load.\32\<NOTE/> Therefore, the experience of the Commission in processingapplications in this area would appear to indicate that any added administrativeburden has not dissuaded the vast majority of funds from waiving or postponingpayment of a deferred sales load when fund shares are exchanged.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>But see </T3>Hutton Investment Series, Inc., at al., Investment CompanyAct Rel.

Tolling and CDSLs</ITAG>Where an exchanged security is subject to a CDSL, paragraph (a)(5) of therevised proposed rule would permit, under certain conditions, the impositionof that CDSL on redemption of the acquired security to be calculated ina manner that would not give the investor credit for the time the acquiredsecurity was held. This ``tolling'' of the time during which the investorheld the acquired security would be permitted only where the acquired securityis not itself subject to any sales load and the issuer of the acquiredsecurity has not adopted a plan of distribution in accordance with rule12b-1 under the Act [17 CFR 270.12b-1] (a ``12b-1 plan'').\33\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Rule 12b-1 permits registered open-end investment companiesto use fund assets to finance the distribution of fund shares, providedthat certain procedural and substantive conditions designed to protectthe interests of shareholders are satisfied.

No. 16431 (June 13, 1988) [53FR 23258, June 21, 1988].Proposed rule 11a-3 did not permit tolling of the time used in calculatinga CDSL, and the commenters did not address the issue. The Commission has,however, permitted tolling in a few orders issued after the rule proposal.\34\<NOTE/> In most cases, both funds involved in the exchange make paymentsfor distribution out of fund assets under a 12b-1 plan, although the rateof payment under the acquired fund's 12b-1 plan is substantially lowerthan the rate under the exchanged fund's plan.\35\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ It should be noted that one order issued prior to proposedrule 11a-3 permit tolling. <T3>See </T3>Prudential-Bache Adjustable Rate preferred Stock Fund, Inc.,et al., Investment Company Act Rel.

The orders issued after the proposal of rule 11a-3 that permit tollingare conditioned on compliance with rule 11a-3, when and if adopted. Ifthe tolling provision is adopted as set out in the revised proposal, thenfunds relying on these orders would have to limit tolling in the mannerdescribed in the rule. Also, the holder of any order issued prior to proposedrule 11a-3 that permitted tolling in a manner other than that permittedin final rule 11a-3 would also have to comply with the final rule. <T3>See </T3>notes 12-14, <T3>supra, </T3>and accompanying test.Given the nature of CDSLs, <T3>i.e. </T3>that amounts paid through a 12b-1 plan are reflected in thereduction of a CDSL over time, the Commission now believes that tollingwould be inappropriate where the acquired shares are subject to a 12b-1plan. Where a shareholder is making <T3>any </T3>payments for distribution through a 12b-1 plan, those paymentsshould be reflected in a commensurate reduction of the CDSL owed. Becausetolling would prevent a shareholder from receiving credit for the 12b-1payments made while holding the acquired shares, the revised proposed rulewould permit tolling only where the acquired shares are subject to no salesloads and the issuer of the acquired shares does not have in effect a 12b-1plan.\36\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ Until the rule is adopted in final form, applicationsfor approval under section 11(a) that include tolling provisions will beprocessed and granted by delegated authority only if the acquired securityis not subject to a 12b-1 plan. Additionally, these and other section 11(a)applications will be conditioned on the terms of the exchange offer beingconformed to the requirements of rule 11a-3, when adopted in final form.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Redemption and Administrative Fees</ITAG>Revised proposed rule 11a-3 would permit the imposition of a redemptionfee and an administrative fee at the time of an exchange. The revised proposedrule would define both ``redemption fee'' and ``administrative fee,'' andwould require that each be uniformly applied to all offerees of the classspecified.\37\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ Paragraph (c)(1) of the revised proposed rule defines``administrative fee'' and paragraph (c)(5) defines ``redemption fee''.The commenters devoted considerable attention to the provisions of theoriginal proposal dealing with redemption fees and administrative fees.\38\<NOTE/> Specifically, three commenters objected to the provisionin proposed rule 11a-3 that would have prohibited the imposition of a redemptionfee on the exchanged security.\39\<NOTE/> That provision had been based on the Commission's understandingthat a portion of the administrative fee typically charged on exchangesis used to reimburse the fund from which a shareholder exchanges for thecost incurred by the fund in redeeming the exchanged shares.\40\<NOTE/> However, commenters maintained that the nominal administrativefee permitted by the proposed rule would be insufficient to both coverthe administrative costs of the exchange and reimburse the fund and theshareholders remaining in the fund after an exchange for the costs of redeemingthe exchanged shares.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Four of the five comment letters received by the Commissionon proposed rule 11a-3 discussed the administrative and redemption feeprovisions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (a)(4) of proposed rule 11a-3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ At least one recipient of a section 11 order representedin its application that the administrative fee imposed would defray thecosts of redeeming the exchanged security. <T3>See </T3>File No. 812-6227 (amended application of Principal WorldFund, Inc., et al.); <T3>see also </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 15018 (Mar. 27, 1986)[51 FR 11381, Apr. 2, 1986] (notice of application) and 15071 (Apr. 24,1986) (order).An exchange can, for some purposes, be characterized as a redemption ofone fund's shares and a purchase of another fund's shares. There is somemerit to the argument that where a fund ordinarily imposes a redemptionfee to cover the costs of redeeming fund shares, no distinction shouldbe made between redemptions pursuant to an offer of exchange and otherredemptions. Therefore, revised proposed rule 11a-3 would permit the impositionof a redemption fee or any scheduled variation thereof on the exchangedsecurity if the fund otherwise imposes such a fee on redemptions of fundshares.\41\<NOTE/> The revised proposed rule would define a ``redemption fee''as any fee that is paid to the fund and is reasonably intended\42\<NOTE/> to compensate the fund for its expenses incident to redemptionof fund shares.\43\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\The revised version of the proposed rule would prohibitspecifically the imposition of any redemption fee on the exchanged securitythat would exceed the redemption fee applicable to a redemption in theabsence of an exchange. <T3>See</T3> discussion of the disclosure requirement for redemption feesat notes 48-49, <T3>infra,</T3> and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\It should be noted that the proposed definition of ``redemptionfee'' would not require that such fees equal precisely the costs of redeemingfund shares.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\When fund shares are redeemed, the fund may incur certaincosts, such as brokerage expenses, in liquidating sufficient fund assetsto pay the redeeming shareholder his proportionate share of fund assets.To prevent the burden of these costs from being borne by those fund shareholdersthat continue to hold their shares, many funds have imposed redemptionfees. Such fees are typically paid by a redeeming shareholder to the funditself.<ITAG tagnum="28">The imposition of any charge or fee upon the redemption of fund sharesraises serious questions because the shareholder's right of redemptionis fundamental to the concept of an open-end investment company. A feepayable upon redemption may take the securities issued by the fund outsidethe definition of a ``redeemable security'' in section 2(a)(32) of theAct </ITAG>[15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(32)]. That section requires that the holderof such securities be entitled to receive ``approximately his proportionateshare of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent thereof.''The staff of the Division of Investment Management, however, has takenthe position that it would not consider redemption fees to violate section2(a)(32) of the Act if the fees do not exceed two percent of the valueof the shares redeemed. <T3>See</T3> John P. Reilly (pub. avail. July 12, 1979).Revised proposed rule 11a-3 also defines ``redemption fee'' to be any feeother than a sales load (as defined in section 2(a)(35) of the Act) ordeferred sales load (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of the rule). Thisdefinition has been included in the revised proposed rule in response tocertain comments received on proposed rule 11a-3. Those comments referredto ``redemption fees'' that are used to pay for distribution activities.\44\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\Such fees would fall within the revised proposal's definitionof ``deferred sales load'' and would be treated as such.It is axiomatic that fund charges should be clearly disclosed and properlylabelled. If a fee is charged upon redemption and is paid to a fund tooffset the costs of redeeming fund shares, that charge is a redemptionfee. On the other hand, if a fee is charged upon redemption, but is paidto the fund's principal underwriter to cover fund distribution expenses,that fee is a deferred sales load.\45\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\As noted above, revised proposed rule 11a-3(a)(4) wouldnot permit the imposition of a deferred sales load on the exchanged securityat the time of an exchange.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission has required funds wishing to impose deferred salesloads, specifically CDSLs, to obtain exemptive relief from sections 2(a)(32),2(a)(35), and 22(c) of the Act and from rule 22c-1 thereunder. </ITAG><T3>See, e.g.,</T3> E.F. Hutton Investment Services, Inc., Investment CompanyAct Rel. Nos. 12079 (Dec. 4, 1981) [46 FR 60703, Dec. 11, 1981] (noticeof application) and 12135 (Jan. 4, 1982) (order); Freedom Investment Trust,Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 14707 (Sept. 5, 1985) [50 FR 37103, Sept.11, 1985] (notice of application) and 14742 (Sept. 30, 1985) (order). Itshould also be noted that a fund that imposes any deferred sales load maynot hold itself out as a ``no-load'' fund. <T3>See</T3> Investment Company Act Rel. No. 13408 (Feb. 28, 1983) [48FR 9532, Mar. 7, 1983] (proposal of rule 6c-8 under the Act) at n.6.For the reasons just discussed, the revised proposal would also excludesales loads and deferred sales loads from the rule's definition of ``administrativefee.'' In addition, the definition would exclude redemption fees. Thisexclusion reflects the view of the Commission that the costs covered byan administrative fee and those covered by a redemption fee should be mutuallyexclusive. This distinction is intended to prevent an exchanging shareholderfrom being charged twice for the same expenses.There was no definition of ``administrative fee'' in the original proposal.The proposal would have permitted the imposition of a ``nominal administrativefee'' at the time of an exchange, but did not define that term. One commenterstated that the meaning of ``nominal administrative fee'' was unclear.Also, the term ``nominal administrative fee'' could have been interpretedto mean any ``stated'' amount. This might have led to very large chargesupon exchanges which, in turn, would have created the incentives for switchingwith which section 11 is concerned. Therefore, the Commission has decidedto define clearly the extent of a permissible administrative fee in therevised proposed rule.The revised proposal would define ``administrative fee'' to mean any feereasonably intended to cover the costs incurred in connection with exchanges.For example, that standard could be satisfied if the fee schedule is unlikelyto result in the average investor paying more than the actual cost of anexchange incurred by the transfer agent.\46\<NOTE/> Alternatively, the revised proposed rule would permit anadministrative fee that is ``nominal,'' as that term is most commonly understood.\47\<NOTE/> Thus, the nominal standard is intended to minimize any incentivefor switching and should be construed accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\Paragraph (c)(1)(i) of the revised proposal contains arequirement that those offering companies that impose an administrativefee based on a cost standard maintain and preserve records of any determinationof the costs incurred in connection with an exchange.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\The Division of Investment Management has stated thatit would not recomend enforcement action to the Commission if a fund offereda no-load exchange privilege subject only to an administrative fee notexceeding $5.00. <T3>See</T3> Chase Fund of Boston (pub. avail. July 28, 1980). The ChaseFund of Boston letter should not be construed to cover any fee exceeding$5.00. The Commission, consistent with that position, would consider anyfee not exceeding $5.00 (or more, as adjusted for inflation) to be ``nominal.''<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Disclosure and Advertising</ITAG>As revised, proposed rule 11a-3 would require that the prospectus of theoffering company disclose the<T3> amount</T3> of any administrative fee that would be imposed on anexchange.\48\<NOTE/> The revised proposed rule would also require that any salesliterature that mentions the existence of the exchange offer also disclosethe<T3> amount</T3> of any administrative fee or redemption fee that wouldbe imposed at the time of an exchange. In addition, the revised proposedrule would require that any advertising that mentions the existence ofthe exchange privilege also disclose the <T3>existence</T3> of any administrative fee or redemption fee that wouldbe imposed on an exchange. If an offering company reserves the right tochange the terms of or terminate an exchange offer, revised proposed rule11a-3 would also require disclosure of that fact in the prospectus of theoffering company and in any sales literature and advertising that mentionsthe existence of the exchange offer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\Since the amount of any redemption fee imposed on sharesbeing exchanged would be disclosed in the prospectus of the fund that issuedthe exchange security, it appears unnecessary to require such disclosurealso in the prospectus of the offering company.<ITAG tagnum="28">It should be noted that the Commission has recently amended Form N-1A,the registration form for mutual funds, to require that all fund expenses,including sales loads redemption fees and administrative fees, be includedin a table located near the front of the prospectus (the ``fee table'').</ITAG><T3>See</T3> Investment Company Act Rel. No. 16244 (Feb. 1, 1988) [53 FR3192, Feb. 4, 1988]. Of course, any fee or load imposed at the time ofan exchange must be disclosed in the fee table.Proposed rule 11a-3 would have simply required disclosure of any administrativefee in the prospectus of the offering company and in any sales literatureor advertising that described the exchange offer. One commenter expresslysupported the administrative fee disclosure provisions of the proposedrule. Another commenter maintained that, if an administrative fee is ``nominal'',funds should not be required to disclose either the existence or the amountof the fee in their advertising and sales literature.\49\<NOTE/> However, that commenter also stated that, if the proposeddisclosure requirements are retained, the Commission should clarify thatit is enough to include <T3>either</T3> the existence or the amount of the fee in advertising andsales literature. A third commenter asked that the final version of therule clarify whether advertising and sales literature would have to disclosethe amount of any administrative fee, or merely the existence of such afee.\50\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\The commenter suggested that, rather than require disclosureof any administrative fee, the adopting release should only suggest thatthe issue of whether to disclose a certain fee should be considered byfunds and the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') inits review of fund advertising. <T3>See</T3> NASD Rules of Fair Practice, sections 35 (c) and (e).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\Any offer of exchange subject only to an administrativefee (and not to any sales loads) would still be required to comply withproposed rule 11a-3. Some funds that make exchange offers with an administrativefee have not obtained individual orders, apparently in reliance on theposition taken by the staff of the Division of Investment Management inthe Chase Fund of Boston letter. <T3>See</T3> note 47, <T3>supra.</T3> However, the staff's position was not intended as a statementof Commission policy or as an interpretation of section 11. Because revisedproposed rule 11a-3 would permit funds to make offers of exchange withoutobtaining individual orders, the Commission sees no reason to continuethe distinction drawn in the Chase Fund of Boston letter. Therefore, afterthe effective date of rule 11a-3, the Chase Fund of Boston letter willbe withdrawn and funds relying on that letter (or other funds with a no-loadoffer of exchange subject to an administrative fee) will be required tobring their exchange offer arrangements into compliance with the provisionsof the rule. Before rule 11a-3 becomes effective, however, a fund can relyon the Chase Fund of Boston letter only if it imposes an administrativefee of no more than $5.00.The existence of an exchange offer may be an important factor in an investor'sdecision to purchase fund shares. Therefore, the prospectus of the offeringcompany and any advertisement or sales literature that mentions the existenceof an exchange offer should include disclosure regarding the administrativeor redemption fees that will be imposed at the time of an exchange.The Commission has drafted revised proposed rule 11a-3 to require thatthe <T3>amount</T3> of any administrative fee be disclosed in the prospectusof the offering company. In addition, unlike the original proposal, therevised proposal would require that any sales literature that mentionsthe existence of an exchange offer also discloses the amount of any administrativefee or redemption fee that would be imposed at the time of an exchange.The revised proposal also would require that any advertising that mentionsthe existence of the exchange offer also disclose the <T3>existence</T3> of any administrative fee or redemption fee that wouldbe imposed at the time of an exchange. Disclosure in advertising and salesliterature that charges may be imposed at the time of an exchange shouldput an investor on notice. If the investor wants additional informationregarding such charges before deciding whether to purchase fund shares,that information would be available in the prospectus of the offering companyor in the prospectus of the issuer of the exchanged security.Finally, unlike the original proposal, the revised proposal also wouldrequire that, where an offering company reserves the right to change theterms of or terminate its exchange offer, the prospectus of the offeringcompany and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existenceof the exchange offer also disclose that the exchange offer is subjectto termination and that its terms are subject to change. This provisionis intended to put prospective shareholders on notice that an exchangeoffer can be terminated or its terms changed.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Offerees</ITAG>Any fund that can rely on the revised proposed rule would be permittedto make an exchange offer to a shareholder of that fund \5\\1\<NOTE/> or of another fund within the same group of investment companies.Paragraph (c)(4) of the revised proposed rule would define ``group of investmentcompanies'' to mean any two or more funds that have a common investmentadviser or principal underwriter, or whose investment advisers or principalunderwriters are under common control, and that hold themselves out toinvestors as related funds for purposes of investment and investor services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ By allowing exchange offers to be made to other shareholderswithin the offering company, the revised proposed rule is intended to coverexchanges between series of the same company. The Commission has grantedseveral orders under section 11 involving series companies. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Industrial Series Trust, Investment Company Act Rel.Nos. 15043 (Apr. 7, 1986) [51 FR 12755, Apr. 15, 1986] (notice of application)and 15088 (May 6, 1986) (order); Shearson Lehman Special Portfolios, InvestmentCompany Act Rel.

The Commissionfinds no reason to distinguish between a group of investment companiesand separate series of a single investment company with respect to exchangeoffers. <T3>See </T3>discussion of former section 11(b)(2) in the proposing releaseat note 3. It should be noted that the Commission has treated the separateseries of a series fund as separate investment companies for purposes ofapplying other rules under the Act. The theory behind this treatment isthat, for all practical purposes, the individual series of a series fundare separate investment companies, each with a different group of shareholdersholding interests in a segregated portfolio. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 16431 (June 13, 1988)[53 FR 23258, June 21, 1988] (proposal of amendments to rule 12b-1 underthe Act) at nn.202-206; Investment Company Act Rel.

The proposed rule would havedefined the term ``family of investment companies'' to include only twoor more registered open-end investment companies that have the same investmentadviser or principal underwriter and that hold themselves out as relatedcompanies for purposes of investment and investor services. This definitionwas based on the ``family of investment companies'' concept used in FormN-SAR [17 CFR 274.101], the periodic reporting form for registered investmentcompanies.\5\\2\<NOTE/> Two commenters argued that the Commission should broadenthe scope of the rule beyond the N-SAR family of fund concept.

Specifically, the revised proposed rule would permitexchange offers to shareholders of other funds in the same ``group of investmentcompanies.''

Given the relative inexperience of the Commission and staff indealing with exchange offers that fall outside the umbrella of common controlembodied in the revised proposal, the Commission believes such exchangeoffers should continue to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in thecontext of individual applications for approval of exchange offers.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Minimum Holding Period</ITAG>Paragraph (b) of revised proposed rule 11a-3 would permit the offeringcompany to require an exchanging shareholder to have held the exchangedsecurity for a minimum period of time where either no sales load is imposedon the acquired security or the sales load imposed is less than the salesload differential. While this provision is identical to that originallyproposed, the Commission specifically requested comment in the proposingrelease on whether rule 11a-3 should require a minimum holding period.Two commenters supported keeping the minimum holding period permissive,and two other commenters suggested deleting the entire provision. The Commissionbelieves that the decision to establish a minimum holding period is betterleft to the business judgment of the offering company. However, the Commissionalso believes that, to avoid confusion, the permissive holding period provisionshould remain part of the rule text.\5\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\7\ One commenter suggested that the final rule includea provision stating that an offer of exchange made under rule 11a-3 mayinclude other conditions that are not inconsistent with the provisionsof the rule.

Amending the Terms of an Exchange Offer</ITAG>Some fund families that offer investors liberal exchange privileges mayexperience heavy switching.\5\\8\<NOTE/> Because exchanges, like other redemptions, may require thatfund assets be liquidated, less active investors could be unfairly burdenedwith the costs, including brokerage fees, that heavy switching may cause.Additionally, a large volume of exchanges may make it more difficult forthe portfolio manager of a fund to maintain both a targeted investmentstrategy and sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated redemptions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\ <T3>See, e.g., Fidelity Investments Keeps It in Family During Crash, </T3>WallSt. J., Oct. 23, 1987, at 6, col. 1; <T3>Fidelity Sector Funds Sustain Big Hits, </T3>Wall St. J., Oct. 23,1987 at 45, col. 1.

If the board decidesthat it should limit or discourage the use of an exchange privilege, directorsshould consider options that would minimize any harmful consequences ofan exchange privilege. Directors also should consider questions of fairnessto shareholders who may have bought fund shares in reliance on the existingexchange privilege. Some funds have already amended the terms of their exchange offers andthe Commission anticipates more will do so.\5\\9\<NOTE/> Although such amendments, as just discussed, may be advisable,they may raise questions of fairness to those shareholders who may havebought (or be holding) shares of a particular fund based in part on anexisting exchange privilege.\6\\0\<NOTE/> Therefore, paragraph (a)(10) of the revised proposed rulewould require that prominent notice of any material change \6\\1\<NOTE/> be given to any holder of a security subject to the exchangeoffer at least sixty days prior to the effective date of the change.\6\\2\<NOTE/> Shareholders would, therefore, be given sixty days beforethe effective date of the change in which to make one or more exchangesunder the terms then in effect or to redeem their shares altogether.\6\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission also requests specific comment on whetherthe final version of rule 11a-3 should also require that where a fund isto amend materially or discontinue an exchange privilege, it must allowshareholders sixty days to redeem out of the fund without the impositionof any CDSL or redemption fee that would otherwise be imposed and to receivea refund of any front-end sales load previously paid. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ <T3>See, e.g., Some Funds Act To Discourage Phone Switches, </T3>Wall St.,J., Feb. 8, 1988 at 27 col. 3; <T3>Fidelity Curbs Switching in Sector Funds, </T3>Wall St. J., Apr. 13,1987 at 45 col. 1; <T3>The Itch to Switch, </T3>Financial World, Feb. 24, 1987 at 35.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\ As discussed above, these fairness questions wouldalso be addressed by providing that any offering company that had previouslymade an offer of exchange could not rely on the rule to amend the termsof such prior offer unless that fund had made certain prospectus disclosure(<T3>see</T3> notes 15-18, <T3>supra,</T3> and accompanying text), and by requiring specific advertising,sales literature and prospectus disclosure whenever a fund relying on therule reserves the right to change or terminate an exchange offer. <T3>See</T3> notes 48-50, <T3>supra</T3>, and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\ Paragraph (a)(10) would provide an exemption from thenotice requirement where the only material effect of an amendment wouldbe to reduce or eliminate an administrative fee, sales load or redemptionfee that would be payable at the time of an exchange. Because such an amendmentwould clearly benefit existing shareholders, prior notice is consideredto be unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\2\ The notice period would be deemed to run from the datenotice of the change is mailed or otherwise delivered to the shareholders.The Commission anticipates that the costs of giving such notice would beborne by the fund's principal underwriter or investment adviser. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\3\ Under this provision, any person who owns shares sixtydays before the effective date of the change in terms, as well as any personwho becomes a shareholder within that sixty day period, would be able tomake one or more exchanges, or redeem altogether, under the terms thenin effect. Paragraph (a)(10) is intended to prevent any unfairness that may ariseshould a fund change the terms of its exchange privilege long after shareholdershave purchased shares in reliance on the prior terms of the exchange privilege.\6\\4\<NOTE/> The cautionary effect of any disclosure concerning the possibilityof change would fade over time, while the shareholder may be investingadditional amounts in the fund. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\4\ The notice requirement of paragraph (a)(10) would alsoapply to the situation where a fund that currently makes an offer of exchangeintends to amend the terms of the exchange offer in such a way that afterthe amendment, it will need to rely on rule 11a-3. In such a case, thefund would be required to comply with the rule's notice and other requirements.This assumes that the fund had made the necessary prospectus disclosure;otherwise, it would need an order. <ITAG tagnum="28">Of course, any material change in the terms of an exchange offer wouldalso be a material event requiring the amendment of a fund's registrationstatement or a supplement to the prospectus. </ITAG><T3>See</T3> rules 485 [17 CFR 230.485] and 497(d) [17 CFR 230.497(d)]under the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq.</T3>].

ProposedRule 11c-1<ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Proposal</ITAG>Proposed rule 11c-1 would have permitted a registered UIT or its sponsor(collectively, ``the offering trust'') to make an exchange offer withoutprior Commission approval to unitholders of the same UIT or to unitholdersof another UIT having the same sponsor, provided certain conditions weremet. Rather than simply codifying the existing orders, which typicallypermit offering trusts to impose a fixed ``reduced sales charge'' of $15per unit (or about 1.5% of the public offering price) on each exchange,\6\\5\<NOTE/> proposed rule 11c-1 would have permitted an offering trustto charge a sales load on the acquired unit no greater than the excess,if any, of the sales load applicable to the acquired unit in the absenceof an exchange over any sales load previously paid on the exchange unit.Additionally, although proposed rule 11c-1 would not have permitted theimposition of an administrative fee at the time of an exchange, the proposingrelease specifically sought comment on whether the final version of therule should include an administrative fee provision. Finally, the proposingrelease specifically sought comment on whether the final version of therule should extend approval to exchange offers made to holders of unitsthat have a different sponsor.\6\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\5\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., et al., Investment CompanyAct Rel.

Commenter Criticism of Proposed Rule 11c-1 </ITAG>While the commenters supported in principal the Commission's attempt toformulate a rule covering UIT exchange offers, two commenters criticizedthe use of the sales load differential approach as a departure from theexisting orders and as unworkable. Specifically, the commenters arguedthat the proposal would seldom permit the imposition of a sales load onexchanges because most exchanges occur between series with the same salesload rate. Also, one commenter asserted that an offering trust would oftenbe unable to determine the sales load previously paid on an exchanged unit.According to the commenter, the difficulty in tracking the sales loadspreviously paid over a series of exchanges relates to the fact that unitsmay be sold by and purchased from someone other than the sponsor, and transferagents generally do not maintain data on sales loads paid by unitholders.The commenters also claimed that a sales load differential would not compensatesponsors for the expense and the risk of maintaining a secondary marketfor units.\67\<NOTE/> Moreover, it was argued that the differential would not compensatethe registered representatives who continually assess the financial andtax position of unitholders. Two commenters stated that, even if the finalversion of the rule permitted the imposition of an administrative fee atthe time of an exchange, as in proposed rule 11a-3, the proceeds from thatfee would be inadequate to defray the costs of an exchange option. In sum,the commenters maintained that, under the proposed sales load differentialprovision, exchange privileges would be uneconomical to offer. Therefore,UITs would either not have exchange privileges or would continue to applyfor an order to charge a fixed reduced sales load on exchanges. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ It should be noted that sponsors are not required tomaintain a secondary market for their units, but do so to offer a moreattractive product to investors and to avoid redemptions that could causea trust to shrink in size. Regarding the scope of permissible offerees under proposed rule 11c-1,one commenter stated that there was no policy reason for the limitationsincluded in the proposed rule, and asked that the Commission reconsiderits position.\68\<NOTE/> A second commenter believed that the rule should be expandedto cover exchanges between UITs that do not have a common sponsor and exchangesfrom mutual funds to UITs.\69\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ Proposed rule 11c-1 would allow a registered UIT or itssponsor to make an exchange offer to unitholders of the same trust or tounitholders of a UIT having the same sponsor. The commenter did not explainwhy the scope of the rule should be extended or state what additional offereesshould be included. <ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission seeks comment on whether it is necessary for rule 11c-1to cover exchange offers made to unitholders of the same series as theoffering trust. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ Beyond referring to the prior orders, the commenter didnot suggest any conditions for a rule to cover such exchanges. As discussed in the proposing release, the Commission has issued six orderspermitting, under certain conditions, applicants to make a type of exchangeoffer known as a ``conversion offer'' to holders of units that have a differentsponsor.\70\<NOTE/> Because there have been few applications involving coversionoffers, there is no need at this time to include such offers in a genericrule. In addition, with limited experience in processing applications involvingexchanges between mutual funds and UITs, the Commission believes that itwould be inappropriate to include such exchanges within the coverage ofproposed rule 11c-1.\71\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ <T3>See e.g., </T3>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., et al., Investment CompanyAct Rel.

Suggested Alternatives to Proposed Rule 11c-1 </ITAG>The commenters suggested two alternative approaches to the sales load differentialprovisions of proposed rule 11c-1: (i) codify the existing orders, permittingthe imposition of a fixed ``reduced sales load''; or (ii) permit the impositionof a sales load at the time of an exchange if it is less than the salesload that would be imposed on a direct purchase of the acquired unit. Forthe reasons stated below, neither of these alternatives is acceptable.With respect to codification of the prior orders, the Commission notesthat such orders have been granted on a case-by-case basis and permit fixedlevels of sales loads at the time of an exchange.\72\<NOTE/> The level of the fixed sales load in each case has been establishedby the applicant as part of a specific representation made in the applicationfor an order. Codification of these orders would require the Commissionto establish a maximum allowable sales load that could be charged at thetime of an exchange. Consequently, the Commission would prefer not to codifythe prior orders in a rule in this area.\73\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ The Commission has permitted holders of orders to imposea reduced sales load so that sponsors can be compensated for secondarymarket activities and, in part, because the additional sales load thatwas requested, $15 per $1,000 unit exchanged was a relatively small amount.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ For example, applicants have typically represented thata ``reduced sales load'' permits a sponsor to pass on to a unitholder thecost savings resulting from reductions in time and expense related to advice,financial planning and operational expense required to sell the units acquiredunder an exchange privilege. The second suggested approach, <T3>i.e. </T3>that the rule permit the imposition of any sales load thatis less than the sales load applicable to a direct purchase of the acquiredunit, is even less acceptable. The commenter that suggested this approachstated that the sponsor would set the amount of the reduced load to reflectthe savings in selling costs on exchanges. The commenter argued that suchan approach would provide the greatest flexibility, consistent with rule22d-1 under the Act [17 CFR 270.22d-1],\74\<NOTE/> to allow the marketplace to determine the appropriate salesload structure. Moreover, the commenter believed that the suitability requirementsof the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of SecuritiesDealers (NASD) \75\<NOTE/> have minimized the danger of a sales representative switchingan investor between trusts for the primary purpose of exacting additionalsales loads. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ Rule 22d-1 permits the sale of investment company securitiesat prices that reflect scheduled variations in, or elimination of, thesales load. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\<T3>See </T3>NASD Rules of Fair Practice, Article III, andSection; 2.The arguments made by the commenter in support of the second alternativedo not warrant including the suggested provision in proposed rule 11c-1.The legislative history of section 11(c) reflects a strong Congressionaljudgment that UIT investors are particularly vulnerable to switching abuses.\7\\6\<NOTE/> Section 11(c) of the Act was enacted to address these abusesby requiring that <T3>any</T3> exchange offer involving the securities of a UIT, includingexchanges at relative net asset value, receive prior Commission approvalor comply with rules adopted by the Commission. In light of the specificintent behind section 11(c), the Commission can grant an order or adopta rule permitting UIT exchange offers only if the order or rule specificallyaddresses, and seeks to prevent, the switching abuses detailed in the legislativehistory. Consequently, the second alternative must be assessed on the basisof whether it would include appropriate safeguards to minimize effectivelythe financial incentive to switch investors or otherwise address the Congressionalconcerns that led to the adoption of section 11(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\6\ <T3>See</T3> S. Rep. 1775, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 7-8 (1940); InvestmentTrust Study, ``Fixed and Semifixed Investment Trusts'', 181-82, 209-30and Appendix Q (1940).The only safeguard suggested by the commenter was that the amount of thesales load charged at the time of an exchange could be required to ``reflecta reasonable estimate of the savings in selling costs for exchange transactions,similar to the provisions of rule 22d-1(f) before it was amended.''\7\\7\<NOTE/> This restriction would not provide an effective means ofreducing the financial incentive to switch investors among UITs. The standardembodied in former rule 22d-1(f) was designed to provide funds with a degreeof flexibility to charge a lower sales load to particular classes of investors,and was deemed to address adequately the Congressional concerns that hadled to the inclusion of section 22(d) in the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-22(d)].However, the rule 22d-1(f) standard would do little to minimize the riskof switching abuses because it would permit the level of the sales loadto be established by the sponsor of the UIT, who would be an interestedparty and potential recipient of the sales load proceeds. Consequently,rather than providing a protection against switching abuses, the suggestedalternative would place decisions as to the appropriate level of salesload to be imposed on an exchange in the hands of the party that has historicallyborne responsibility for the abuses that led to the enactment of section11.\7\\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\7\ Rule 22d-1 was amended in Investment Company Act Rel.No. 14390 (Feb 22, 1985) [50 FR 7909, Feb. 27, 1985]. Prior to the amendmentof the rule, paragraph (f) provided an exemption from section 22(d) ofthe Act to permit reduction or elimination of a sales load with respectto a sale of redeemable securities to, <T3>inter alia,</T3> employee benefit plans not qualified under section401 of the Internal Revenue Code, as long as the non-qualified plans satisfieduniform criteria relating to the realization of economies of scale on saleseffort and sales related expense selected by the issuer and described inthe prospectus. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\8\ The commenter that suggesed this approach also statedthat the level of sales load would be governed by market forces. None ofthe commenters presented emprical data to the Commission on the existenceof retail price competition in the UIT industry. It should be noted thatthe redeemable securities of a UIT are subject to the retail price maintenanceprovisions of section 22(d), which may prevent the development of effectiveretail price competition. <T3>See generally Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission on thePublic Policy Implications of Investment Company Growth, </T3>H.R. Rep.No. 2337, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., at 208-09, 218-21 (1966). In any event,the commenter's argument still ignores the history of section 11(c). The support of the second alternative, the commenter also argued that theswitching abuses that led to the enactment of section 11(c) ``have longsince been minimized by the NASD Rules of Fair Practice.'' The Commissionacknowledges that switching abuses could place a broker-dealer that isa member of the NASD in violation of the NASD's suitability requirements,and that those requirements may therefore deter such persons from engagingin switching.\7\\9\<NOTE/> However, the existence of the NASD rules does not reducethe potential for abuse in this area to the point where a rule under section11(c) does not need to include provisions designed to minimize the riskof abuse.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\9\ Art. III, section 2 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practicestates:<ITAG tagnum="28">In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale or exchange of anysecurity, a member shall have reasonable grounds for believing that therecommendation is suitable for such customer upon the basis of the facts,if any, disclosed by such customer as to his other security holdings andas to his financial situation and needs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">4. Request for Comment</ITAG>In light of (i) the commenters' beliefs that proposed rule 11c-1 failsto provide for adequate compensation of sponsors for maintaining a secondarymarket, (ii), the constraints of section 11, and (iii) the problems presentedby the alternative approaches suggested by the commenters, the Commissionhas decided not to take further action on proposed rule 11c-1 at this time.\8\\0\<NOTE/> Instead, the Commission is requesting additional public commenton how to proceed in the area of offers of exchange involving UITs. Specifically,the Commission seeks comment on the following: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\0\ The Commission will, of course, continue to processapplications under section 11 for exchange offers involving UITs.(i) If the Commission should go forward with rule 11c-1, whether a salesload provision can be drafted both to minimize the problems that led tothe adoption of section 11(c) and to provide for adequate compensationto sponsors for the costs of maintaining a secondary market;(ii) If the Commission should go forward with rule 11c-1, whether the ruleshould include provisions such as those included in revised proposed rule11a-3;\81\<NOTE/> and <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>notes 48-50 and 61-64, <T3>supra, </T3>and accompanying text.(iii) Whether a rule relating to UIT exchange offers is impracticable andthe Commission should simply continue to consider applications on a caseby case basis.C. Request for Comment on Rule 11a-2.In light of revised proposed rule 11a-3, the Commission believes that itis appropriate to reexamine the provisions of rule 11a-2 to determine whetherthere are reasons to distinguish between mutual funds and insurance companyseparate accounts in the exchange offer area. As a matter of general policy,separate accounts should be subject to the same requirements as mutualfunds, absent a compelling need under the Act arising from the specialnature of the insurance product.\82\<NOTE/> The Commission will consider whether to propose amendmentsto rule 11a-2 to provide that exchange offers by registered insurance companyseparate accounts are subject to the same or similar conditions as exchangeoffers by mutual funds. Therefore, the Commission requests comment relatingto the possible proposal of amendments to rule 11a-2 to better protectseparate account investors and facilities competitive equality among investmentcompany products in the exchange offer area. Specifically, commenters focuson whether there are insurance or other considerations that may make itinappropriate for any other provisions of revised proposed rule 11a-3 tobe incorporated into rule 11a-2. The Commission will, of course, considerall comments and suggestions in developing any rule proposal in this area.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ The Commission has stated that ``[m]anagement investmentcompanies funding vairable insurance products should be subject to thesame procedural requirements as other management investment companies,absent a compelling need under the Act for special regulation arising fromthe nature of the insurance product.''

Mutual funds, advisingor principal underwriters may incur some costs in complying with the disclosureand notice provisions of the revised proposed rule. The costs related tothe notice requirement could be minimized by simply including the noticeon a separate document with one of the mailings to shareholders that fundsmake to comply with the federal securities and the rules thereunder, orfor other purposes. The revised proposed rule will also require offeringcompanies that impose administrative fees on exchanges based on a coststandard to maintain records with respect to the actual costs incurredin connection with exchanges. The Commission would benefit from the revisedproposal because its staff would have to review few applications requestingorders in this area. Comments are requested, however, on these mattersand on the costs or benefits of any other aspect of the proposed action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysisin accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding revised proposed rule 11a-3.The Analysis explains that revised proposed rule 11a-3 would permit certainoffers of exchange between mutual funds. It states that the revised proposedrule is intended to protect investors from the abuses that led to the enactmentof section 11, and to reduce significantly the number of applications filedwith the Commission regarding exchange offers. The Analysis indicates thatthe revised proposed rule contains no reporting requirements. The revisedproposed rule would require any offering company that imposes an administrativefee on an exchange based on a cost standard, to maintain records with respectto the actual costs incurred in connection with its exchanges. Any offeringcompany, however, that elected to impose no more than a nominal administrativefee would be free of the recordkeeping requirement. The revised proposedrule would require prospectus, advertising and sales literature disclosureregarding any charges imposed at the time of an exchange and notice toshareholders if the terms of an exchange offer are to be amended materially.These disclosures might impose costs on fund advisers or principal underwriters,although the additional disclosure required is minimal. However, such costscould be minimized by including the notice in a separate document withone of the mailings to shareholders that funds make to comply with thefederal securities laws and the rules thereunder, or for other purposes.To the extent that the proposed rule would eliminate the need for mutualfunds to file applications seeking orders under section 11, it will reducethe costs incurred by smaller entities in preparing and filing applications.A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained bycontacting Brian P.
