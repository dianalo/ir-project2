This has led to a need for a new approachto properly inhibit pipelines in these low volume regimes. Research hasled to the development of new test methods to select inhibitors thatcan work under these conditions. It has also led to the development ofnew, patented corrosion inhibitors that have been proven in the fieldto be effective in stratified flowing pipelines that were experiencingleaks and catastrophic blowouts due to pitting attack.</TEXT></DOC>
