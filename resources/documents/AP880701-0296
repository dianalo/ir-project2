Many of the Chevrolet rebates will be leaner, but Buick rebateswill continue unchanged except for the LeSabre, which was droppedfrom the program, a spokeswoman said.   Chevrolet also dropped its double rebate on the Nova andSpectrum subcompacts, said spokeswoman Mary McElyea. As intended,the program increased the number of import owners who shopped atChevrolet dealerships, but irritated some domestic-car owners.

Rebates increased by $100 to $500 on Cavalier four-door andwagon and $60 on Nova and Spectrum.   Chevrolet also added the Sprint to the program, with a $300rebate, McElyea said.   Rebates on Chevrolet trucks remain unchanged and range from $300on the S-10 pickup EL model to $750 on the four-wheel-drive S-10Blazer.
