Without capital, the Jackson bank won't be able to make new loans; extend additional credit to existing borrowers, or retire borrower stock. Under system rules, borrowers have to buy stock and can redeem it at the same price when they pay off their loans. Pending bailout legislation would protect the value of borrower stock holdings in the event of bank failure. The objective is to stem the flight of borrowers from the system.    A system spokesman said that continuing operating and loan losses will leave the Jackson bank, which has assets of about $2 billion, insolvent before Dec. 31.    The system, the nation's biggest agricultural lender, has been bleeding financially for three years and is in need of a big capital infusion. But thus far, using accounting gimmicks and other temporary measures, the system has avoided letting a major lending arm become insolvent.    The Jackson bank's inability to redeem borrower stock &quot;may increase the concern of borrowers from other Farm Credit institutions . . . and possibly result in further borrower flight,&quot; the system said in a statement yesterday. The loss of good borrowers has compounded the system's woes.    In Washington, Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration, said the system still has &quot;substantial resources&quot; and enough flexibility to maintain service to borrowers at troubled banks. As the system's regulator, the agency could order stronger banks to transfer funds and services to the Jackson bank until Congress enacts a bailout package, he said.    Meanwhile, the Jackson bank has begun planning to reduce its operations next year to a level that revenues from its loan portfolio can support, a bank official said. Because of a good harvest this fall, the bank doesn't foresee many loan defaults or other payment problems.    As previously reported, both the House and the Senate have passed Farm Credit bailout bills that would provide a multibillion dollar package of assistance. However, differences remain between the two versions and it isn't known how soon legislation will go to the president.    The Jackson bank has been fighting an effort by the system's regulator, the Farm Credit Administration, to force the bank to increase its loss reserves. The system spokesman said that the expected insolvency wasn't tied to that dispute, and that if the increased reserves are eventually required, the Jackson bank would be deeper in the red.    The system said the Jackson bank is &quot;exploring alternative means&quot; of staying in business and serving its customers, but as of yesterday hadn't developed a plan to do that. System officials were meeting last night in New York.    The spokesman said other system banks are &quot;experiencing severe financial stress.&quot;    During the third quarter, the system's operations showed a sharp deterioration, though the system reported its first quarterly profit in more than two years using an unusual accounting technique. The system is burdened with a big load of high-interest-rate borrowings it made in the bond market, and a shrinking base of good-quality loans to farmers. </TEXT></DOC>
