(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A suspect in a four-state murder spreeconfessed to killing a convenience store clerk, and said he hadbeen using cocaine heavily the month before the shooting.   In an emotional confession, Gregg Francis Braun, 28, admittedkilling Geraldine Valdez on July 23 during a preliminary hearingThursday to determine if there was enough evidence to charge him instate district court.   Braun testified that he had been undergoing psychologicalcounseling in his home town of Garden City, Kan., since June forrecurring violent dreams, and that recent, heavy use of cocaineworsened a lifelong violent tendency.   He told the court he had been having more and more bad dreams,``dreams of killing people.''   A weapons expert testified that a .25-caliber handgun seizedfrom Braun, which he admitted using to kill Mrs. Valdez, isapparently the same weapon used in the killings last month of twopeople in Kansas and one in Texas.   Braun also has been identified as a suspect in the shootingdeath of flower shop clerk Gwen Miller and the wounding of twoother women in Ardmore, Okla., on July 21.   All of the killings were similar: The victims were shop clerksand were shot in the back of the head with a .25-caliber pistol.   Braun, jailed here in lieu of $1 million bond, was held fortrial on charges of first-degree murder and second-degree armedrobbery. He will be arraigned before a district judge within 20days, said Assistant District Attorney Leslie Skinner.   Ms. Skinner said she would seek the death penalty.   Assistant Public Defender Stephen Aarons said Braun has noprevious felony convictions, was impaired and unable to appreciatethe criminality of his action and was cooperative with authorities.   Asked first by Aarons and later by Skinner whether he deniedkilling Mrs. Valdez, Braun said, ``No, I don't deny it.''   He also admitted stealing about $200 from Jandamp;T Mini-Mart, acombination store and gas station where Mrs. Valdez worked inSpringer, 100 miles northeast of Santa Fe.   Larry Warehime, a firearms examiner for the state Department ofPublic Safety, said tests showed the bullets taken from Mrs.Valdez's body and other casings found in the store were fired fromBraun's gun.   Warehime said similar tests indicated the gun was the same oneused in the Texas and Kansas shootings.   Authorities in Kansas have charged Braun with the separatemurders of two Garden City convenience store clerks, BarbaraKochendorfer and Mary Rains, on July 19. Prosecutors in Texas thisweek charged Braun with the murder of photo shop owner Edley PerrySpurrier in Pampa on July 20.</TEXT></DOC>
