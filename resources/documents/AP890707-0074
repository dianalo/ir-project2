William Piacitelli, the first witness at Mrs. Helmsley's federaltax evasion trial, also said Thursday that the cost of renovationsand other expenses, even groceries, were spread over severalHelmsley companies.   Piacitelli, fired as controller of the Helmsley-controlledHospitality Services Co., said Mrs. Helmsley would obtain cash forthe estate by having employees fill out business expense sheets.   ``Who approved petty cash reimbursements?'' asked Assistant U.S.Attorney James DeVita.   ``Mrs. Helmsley,'' Piacitelli responded.   ``Personally?'' DeVita asked.   ``Personally,'' he said.   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is on trial in Manhattan federal court chargedwith evading taxes by disguising $4 million in renovations andoperating costs at her Connecticut mansion as business expenses. Shealso faces other fraud and extortion charges.   Harry Helmsley, 80, who was indicted in April 1988 with his wife,was removed from the trial after U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr.found him mentally incompetent.   The Helmsleys head a $5 billion real estate and hotel empire.They purchased Dunnellen Hall, in Greenwich, Conn., in the summer of1983 for $11 million.   The Harley Hotel chain paid for tens of thousands of dollars oflandscaping work at the estate because the company had a hotel inEnfield, Conn., Piacitelli said.   In other testimony, Piacitelli said his company used the initials``D.H.'' in business records to indicate money paid out to DunnellenHall.   He said when he was asked in 1983 by an outside accountant toexplain what ``D.H.'' stood for, he responded, ``Don't hask.''   Soon after, Piacitelli said Frank Turco, his boss and aco-defendant at the trial, wrote a memo saying the money had``inadvertently'' been paid out as a business expense and that thecompany should be reimbursed.   ``Were any of these payments inadvertent?'' asked DeVita.   ``No,'' Piacitelli said.   ``They were done deliberately,'' DeVita said.   ``Yes, they were,'' the witness said.   Piacitelli said he was fired from his job as controller inFebruary 1986 despite a personal plea to Mrs. Helmsley.   The defense said in its opening arguments that it will show thatthe expenses were lawful because the estate was used for businesspurposes.</TEXT></DOC>
