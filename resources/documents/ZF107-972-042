 But, despitethis, the vast majority of CS research is supported by government monies.andO;The reason is simple: the government takes a much longer view than privateindustry, which can't see past the next quarter.andP;  And a long-term outlook ismandatory for the risks involved in viable, basic computer science research.andM;&quot;We're in the business of trying risky ideas.andP;  It's not unusual for us orother universities.andP;  It's a very different story for industry.andP;  If industryinvests X millions, they want to make money .andP;  .  .  there's no one otherthan the government willing to take these risks,&quot; says Thomas Gross, aprofessor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and arecipient of research funds from the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency (DARPA).andM;&quot;Industry's timetable is too short to try leading-edge things,&quot; agrees SteveSquires, chief scientist in DARPA's Information Science and Technology Office(ISTO).andP;  &quot;DARPA is like a high-quality, low-cost venture capitalist with along-term outlook.andP;  You have to have that in government.andP;  The role ofgovernment is to reduce the risk in critical technology areas important tothe country.andP;  It's DARPA's job to help those advances come to the U.S.andP;  andnot elsewhere.&quot;andM;Squires should know.andP;  Today, when it comes to government funding of computerresearch, the Department of Defense (DOD) and its principal technology agent,DARPA, have become about the only way to fly for most university computerscience researchers.andP;  Other federal dollars for fundamental computerresearch, such as those from the National Science Foundation (NSF), are fewand far between, so researchers who don't want to play in DARPA's band oftendon't have a choice.andM;In fact, ISTO/DARPA, being the dominant funding source for experimentalcomputer science in universities, has the power to make or break a computerscience department, according to Richard Karp, a computer science professorat the University of California at Berkeley.andP;  According to The Nation, theDOD controls 71% of all federal funds for academic CS research compared to45% a decade ago.andP;  More than 80% of the federal money going to the Big Fourcomputer science universities--Berkeley, CMU, the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology and Stanford University--comes from the military.andP;  MichaelDertouzos, director of MIT's Lincoln Laboratories, told the magazine that, ifhe had to depend on the NSF, he'd have &quot;a dead laboratory.&quot;andM;The most troubling fact about DARPA's influence over academia is its heavytilt toward applied, rather than basic, research, a bias that is evident inits budget figures of recent years.andP;  Although some disagreement exists overhow much DARPA tries to direct the research it funds toward futuristicmilitary technology, few dispute the idea that an emphasis on such appliedresearch makes the country ill-equipped to compete with nations, such asJapan, that invest in more practical, commercially applicable technology.andM;&quot;I know there are many significant issues about DARPA's funding.andP;  Should itfund basic research, [or] basic research in software or basic research inprogramming tools?andP;  There's no doubt industry should fund basic research muchmore than DARPA.andP;  But very few companies sponsor outside basic research.andP;  SoDARPA is our major funder until it decides otherwise,&quot; says Richard Waters,professor of computer science at MIT in Cambridge, Mass.andM;A Basic Research LackandM;DARPA's recent emphasis on applied research clearly has come at the expenseof basic research.andP;  According to the Project on Funding Policy in ComputerScience, part of the Association for Computing Machinery's Special InterestGroup on Automata and Computability Theory (SIGACT), DARPA's budget foruniversity computer science research grew from $14.8 million in fiscal year1980 to $94.3 million in FY 88--that's 340 percent in constant dollars.andO;Nearly 90% of that increase was due to funding for applied programs inDARPA's so-called 6.2 exploratory research category, which soared from $5.8million to $76 million in that time span.andP;  Basic research, in contrast,climbed only moderately between FY 80 and FY 83, dropped between FY 84 and FY85, and has stayed flat since then.andM;Back to the BasicsandM;&quot;Funding from all branches of the government is much harder to get now,&quot;MIT's Waters says.andP;  &quot;It's the budget squeeze and congressional pressure.andO;DARPA's also become much more oriented toward applied research.andP;  Appliedresearch is much more directed toward specific missions, so in some ways it'sless risky than basic [research].andP;  And you probably don't have to spend asmuch money on applied.andP;  It wasn't like that five or 10 years ago.andP;  Then DARPAwas definitely doing basic research.&quot;andM;Back then, DARPA was doing things like preserving what are now mainstreamtechnologies.andP;  &quot;There are parts of the computer industry that wouldn't existwithout DARPA,&quot; says Waters.andP;  &quot;Take artificial intelligence.andP;  Based on thehype of the late '60s, early '70s, everyone thought AI was going to beincredibly not stuff.andP;  But there was a huge collapse in the early '80s.andP;  AIwent through a real boom and bust cycle.andM;&quot;the one outfit that really stuck it out and persevered was DARPA.andP;  DARPAdeserves absolute credit for keeping AI alive in the '70s.andP;  Without DARPA,there'd be no AI.andP;  It would have died,&quot; he says.andM;The increase in applied research, which began at about the same time DARPA atabout the same time DARPA monies for basic research began to decline, sprangfrom DARPA's Strategic Computing Program (SCP), nee Strategic ComputingInitiative (SCI).andP;  Probably the country's most significant federallysponsored computer research project, the SCP is linked to certain militarymissions such as expert systems for battle management and land-based roboticvehicles.andP;  Although funding for the SCP budget has fluctuated, it has neverdipped below $100 million, dwarfing other government agencies.andP;  The programreached its zenith of $127.1 million in FY 88 and its nadir of $104.5 millionin FY 87.andP;  Notwithstanding its purported contributions to national security,the SCP hasn't bee exempt from the current atmosphere of fiscal restraint, asindicated by its projected budgets of $114.9 million in FY 90 and $110.3million in FY 91.andP;  The current atmosphere in Washington will make thebasic-applied choice even harder, since the DOD's FY 90 budget is going to beflat at best.andM;Despite what the figures says, SIGACT reports that a large percentage ofSCP's technology base is actually basic research in fundamental computerscience.andP;  Only 20% of SCP's budget is slated for military-related technicalapplications, such as the autonomous land vehicles and smart weapons.andM;Nevertheless, says ISTO's Squires, &quot;We don't operate in the mode of 'We'll doanything whether it works or not.'andP;  Before we commit money, we have a strongsense of whether a particular project will work.&quot;andM;Indeed, says Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Waters.andP;  &quot;Now every[software] application we write has to be clothed in an immediateapplication.andP;  The change to applied research also means that there aren't anymore three-year funding contracts.andP;  The contracts are all for one year.andO;That's not the way to do basic research.andP;  In basic research, continuitymatters more than immediate dollars.andP;  A year is nothing in basic research.&quot;andM;Nor is it much in applied research when most of the year has to be spentgenerating proposals that will keep the project alive to the next fiscalyear.andP;  Waters says the new year-to-year contracting system requires at leastthree times the effort to acquire the same amount of funding.andM;In Waters' book, that ain't no way to run a railroad.andM;Funding HasslesandM;&quot;Our production is definitely down,&quot; Waters says.andP;  &quot;The one-year contract andthe accompanying red tape are a significant waste of resources.andP;  We couldhave done more without spending so much time on all the funding proposals.andO;DARPA needs to do a lot more sopwing and a lot less seeding.&quot;andM;More precisely, many researchers believe that the DARPA funding process, andthe subsequent influence it wields over the project, should be less intent onseeding the latest glamorous trends and more focused on pursuing practicaltechnology.andM;&quot;Letting DOD be the lead agency in computer science allows them to skewdevelopment to a higher technology but [that has] much less commercialviability,&quot; says Clark Thomborson, a computer science professor at theUniversity of Minnesota at Duluth.andP;  Thomborson started his career atBerkeley, but departed after refusing to accept any military funding for hisresearch.andM;&quot;If you accept military money, it means on some level you're going to helpthe military,&quot; Thomborson says.andP;  &quot;Somewhere that justification is being madefor the project.andP;  It smells of chicanery.andP;  You're lying about what yourresearch is going to do.andP;  Military funding skews the faculty toward beingrocket scientists working on the latest gee-whiz high technology and awayfrom traditional engineering, where they ask what the technology is and whatit can do.andP;  The policy makers aren't funding these projects blindly.&quot;andM;One award-winning professor of computer science chose to go even further whenspeaking before a panel on federal funding of the academic physical sciencessponsored by the American association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).andO;He said the link between 6.2 money and military technologies creates &quot;abuilt-in encouragement to dishonesty.&quot;andM;&quot;I think that all up and down the line people are telling two stories, one topeople above them, another to people below,&quot; says Berkeley's Karp.andP;  &quot;I thinkthe guys in DARPA who really have done a wonderful job for the field defendthat program to Congress in a much more instrumental and military-orientedway, while at the same time trying to use the monies that come out of it tofoster the health of university departments and to get some generic researchgoing.andM;&quot;I think people in the universities who want a piece of the [SCP] action arealmost overwhelmingly forced to masquerade what they are doing as related tothese specific missions, such as battle management, when in fact what theywant to be doing is generic work in AI.andP;  And if you really tell it like itis, you might just be out of luck.andP;  So there is just an awful lot ofduplicity arising as a consequence of the funding process,&quot; Karp concludes.andM;On the other side of the question, government officials argue that DARPAfunds research in a way very similar to large private corporations,supporting basic research witha an ultimate eye toward profitable use.andO;&quot;DARPA takes the farthest outlook on what benefits DOD.andP;  It's not that muchdifferent from IBM and aTandamp;T doing things that benefit the company,&quot; saysRobert Kahn, former director of ISTO and now president of the Reston,Va.-based Corporation for national Research Initiatives.andM;ISTO's Squires adds: &quot;Once we commit funds, we have at least a 50-50cost-sharing arrangement.andP;  We probably achieve a return two to four times ouroriginal investment.andP;  And we have an extremely healthy collaboration withindustry and academia.andP;  WE don't put up with nonsense from them, and theydon't put up with nonsense from us.&quot;andM;A Happy CamperandM;CMU's Gross is one researcher who is very happy with his relationship withthe government.andP;  He says DARPA neither interfered with nor micro-managed theCMU team during the iWarp project, which was developing an architecture forvarious high-performance parallel systems.andP;  Neither did the agency attempt toinvolve the iWrap team in any military projects or classified research.andO;DARPA, in effect, said here's the money, let us know what happens.andM;&quot;Only DARPA money made this possible,&quot; CMU's Gross says.andP;  &quot;The SCI moenyallowed us to take these ideas and make them real.andP;  That allowed us to hireindustrial partners and get into industry much faster than we ever could bywriting papers.andP;  You can write all the papers you want, but nothing works aswell as having a demo in your basement.andP;  DARPA's funding also meant we couldcreate software that would get the system accepted by users.&quot;andM;Gross' experience may have been colored by the fact that iWarp was attechnology DOD was intent on perfecting.andP;  Not everyone has had the same happyexperiences with the agency.andP;  If a DARPA-funded researcher fails to reach thespecific goals dictated by DARPA on time, then, regardless of te intrinsicmerit of the work, the project may be history, says Berkeley's Karp.andP;  Such afate befell the DARPA-supported speech-understanding project at severaluniversities a decade ago.andM;Steve Colley, president of NCube in Beaverton, Ore., concurs: &quot;Once DARPApicks a particular technology, the agency is closed to others.&quot;andP;  The companyrecently introduced what it calls the world's fastest supercomputer, an8,192-processor NCube 2 that maxes out at 27 billion floating pointoperations per second.andP;  Colley claims to have been shown the door on theseveral occasions when the asked DARPA to fund some commercially viableprojects for prospective NCube customers that couldn't purchase the NCube 2without DARPA assistance.andM;&quot;We're not dependent on DARPA for our success, but its refusal to fund thosecustomers which need DARPA money really limits our ability to penetratecertain markets,&quot; Colley said.andP;  &quot;That makes it tough on us.andP;  And I'm not sureDARPA should be dictating as heavily as it is regarding spending.andP;  DARPA'stoo heavily military and government oriented.andP;  Look at MITI [Japan's Ministryof international Trade and Industry].andP;  They're much more commercial oriented.andO;That's what the U.S.andP;  needs to do.andP;  I hope funding starts to go across a muchbroader area.andP;  And DARPA needs to be less headstrong.&quot;andM;That's not just one man's opinion.andP;  But it's the folks who want DARPA's moneywho, most unfortunately, have to adjust, not the agency delivering the goods.andO;Because, like it not, for the present and foreseeable future, DARPA's whereit's at.andM;Down the Rat HoleandM;&quot;The reality is that we're not going to be able to compete internationallywithout government subsidies,&quot; University of Minnesota's Thomborson says.andO;&quot;So the question is, What kind of research should the government be funding?andO;SCI and the VLSIC [very large-scale integrated circuit] projects were moneydown the rat hole.andM;&quot;What we need is a civilian form of DARPA,&quot; Thomborson concludes.andP;  &quot;With thattype of agency and the right moral leadership, we could find an excitingproject to get behind.andP;  Individual researchers' morale is a significantproblem now.andP;  Rather than helping the U.S.andP;  and making life better on theplanet, I think many of them [researchers] have a nagging feeling that what'scoming out of their work is a command and control system to fly bombers.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
