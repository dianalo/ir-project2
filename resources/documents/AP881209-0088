(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former television preacher's allegationsthat he had sex with PTL founder Jim Bakker are ``lies'' from a``former good friend,'' Tammy Faye Bakker says.   Mrs. Bakker denied the charges against her husband by John WesleyFletcher, a former co-host of ``The PTL Club,'' in an interviewThursday with TV talk show host Sally Jessy Raphael.   ``I've lived with this man for 27 years and I know he's not(bisexual),'' Mrs. Bakker said during the show.   Mrs. Bakker agreed to appear on the show after Raphael promisednot to do a planned show with Fletcher, said Burt Dubrow, executiveproducer of the ``Sally Jessy Raphael Show.'' The interview withMrs. Bakker will be aired Dec. 19.   Fletcher, who appeared on ``The PTL Club'' from the mid-1970s to1981, said in an interview for January's Penthouse magazine: ``I wasJim Bakker's male prostitute.'' Bakker, who was indicted this weekon federal charges of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy, has deniedin a sworn deposition that he has ever had a homosexualrelationship, and has denied charges of financial wrongdoing.   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting he had asexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and paying herhush money.   With her husband watching the taping on a tiny monitor in thedriveway outside the couple's leased 14-room log cabin, Mrs. Bakkertalked about the pain she has suffered during the past two years,including being humiliated when people at shopping malls andrestaurants ridiculed her and her husband.   ``Sometimes I wish we could just move away to another planet,''she said tearfully.</TEXT></DOC>
