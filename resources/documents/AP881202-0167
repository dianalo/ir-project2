The assembly voted 154-2 to hold the session in Geneva on Dec.13-15. The United States and Israel were the only nations votingagainst the measure.   Britain abstained. It has said the United States should allowArafat to speak but opposed the harsh criticism of the United Statesin the U.N. resolution.   The unprecedented shift to Geneva was ordered because the UnitedStates rejected U.N. appeals to reconsider and admit Arafat, who itaccuses of being an accessory to terrorism.   Arafat sought to address the 159-nation world body here this weekduring its annual debate on Palestine.   He was to have addressed the General Assembly on Thursday in NewYork to discuss recent decisions of the Palestine National Councilin Algiers to declare an independent Palestinian state and acceptU.N. resolutions which implicitly recognize Israel's right to exist.   The meeting in Geneva would be the first time the United Nationshas convened a regular session outside New York City since theGeneral Assembly first moved into its permanent Manhattanheadquarters, which opened in 1952.   Between 1946 and 1952, the United Nations held sessions primarilyin New York but also met twice in Paris and once, its first meeting,in London.   Absent from Friday's roll call were Dominica and South Africa.South Africa, because of its policies of racial apartheid, wasstripped of its voting rights in 1974.   After the vote, the highest-ranking U.S. official at the UnitedNations, Undersecretary-General Joseph Verner Reed, sent a personalletter to President Reagan, appealing to him to let Arafat speak.   The letter was widely but not officially circulated, and Reedsaid he was not responsible for leaking it to the press.   ``The bottom line, Mr. President, is that the action (to deny avisa) to an invited guest of the United Nations has doneincalculable damage to United States credibility in the worldarena.''   Reed said the United States is a ``proponent of free speech allover the world, yet it will not permit Chairman Arafat to enter theUnited States to speak in a public forum on international territory...   ``Does this spell the end of the United Nations in the UnitedStates and the United States in the United Nations ... ''   Israel's acting ambassador, Johanan Bein, had urged the GeneralAssembly to reject the measure.   ``This assembly is asked to pack its bags and go to anothercontinent for the dubious pleasure of lending an ear to the personwho conceived, instigated and organized some of the world'scruellest atrocities against the innocent citizens of many nations.''   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun said: ``The change of venue isunnecessary. Nevertheless we would not oppose such a move and theUnited States would be represented if a meeting were held inGeneva.''   He said the United States was justified in denying a visa toArafat.   PLO envoy Zuhdi Labib Terzi said: ``Once again, within hours, theinternational body in this community has stood together for what isright against what is wrong.''   He said the PLO would have preferred to meet in New York. ``It isonly because of the intransigence of the host country and its lackof respect for international law that it has to pick up the bill ofmore than a million dollars.''   He was referring to transportation costs of all delegations,above the U.N. estimate of $645,500.   The three-day meeting at Geneva's stately Palais de Nations, theU.N. European Headquarters, will require an additional appropriationof $440,700, but about $204,800 in other costs can be absorbed inthe existing budget, U.N. officials said.   The United States probably would be expected to pay a quarter ofthe additional cost, in accordance with its one-fourth share of theregular annual budget. It has said it would participate in theGeneva session.   The United Nations is facing a financial crisis, caused largelyby the U.S. indebtedness of about $500 million. The United States isthe biggest U.N. contributor and its biggest debtor nation.   On Wednesday the assembly overwhelmingly deplored the U.S. denialof a visa to Arafat to speak in New York. It gave the United States24 hours to reconsider and reverse its decision.   On Thursday night, the U.S. government defied the U.N. resolutionand rejected its appeal, saying the decision to bar Arafat was final.   Arafat, who visited the United Nations in 1974, was barred fromvisiting the U.N. on international territory by Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz on grounds that he is an ``accessory to terrorism.''   The United Nations says that by denying Arafat a visa the UnitedStates has violated the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, underwhich the United States is obligated to grant visas to U.N. guests.</TEXT></DOC>
