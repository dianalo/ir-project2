A 5 percent jump in the incidence of job-related illnesses andinjuries, from 79 per every 1,000 workers in 1986 to 83 per 1,000workers last year was the first increase since 1984, the Bureau ofLabor Statistics said.   The AFL-CIO blamed the increase on a ``lack of enforcement'' offederal safety standards and regulations by the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration.   However, directors of OSHA and the Bureau of Labor Statisticssaid at least part of the increase can be attributed to betterrecord-keeping brought about in part by stiff fines againstcompanies that under-report job accidents to the government.   Meanwhile, job-related fatalities in surveyed private businesseswith 11 or more employees dropped from 3,610 in 1986 to 3,400 lastyear, a decrease that BLS officials called ``statisticallyinsignificant.''   A total of 5,843,100 on-the-job injuries were reported last year,compared with 5,492,000 in 1986.   Nearly half of the injuries were serious enough to cost a fullday or more of work, and the number of workdays lost totaled 48.8million, compared with 45.4 million workdays lost to injuries in1986.   About 190,000 workers _ nearly 39 percent more than in 1986 _suffered job-related illnesses in 1987, most of them noise-relatedhearing losses, skin diseases and repetitive motion ailments such ascarpal tunnel syndrome, prevalent in the meatpacking industry.   The bureau said chronic and long-term latent cases that are oftendifficult to recognize or relate to the workplace are included inthe illness statistics ``but are clearly understated.''   Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood said the increasein the job injury and illness rates may be due to betterrecord-keeping resulting from new government guidelines andintensive efforts to improve the statistics.   For example, the BLS last year trained some 14,000representatives from companies employing a total of 20 millionpeople on keeping accurate injury and illness records.   The training plus a crackdown by OSHA on recordkeeping violationsfollowed several years of complaints that companies wereunder-reporting illnesses and accidents as a way of avoiding OSHAinspections.   Among others, the National Academy of Sciences last yearquestioned the validity of the government's job health and safetydata because of ``severe under-reporting'' by employers.   An academy panel said the actual number of job-related fatalitiescould be as much as triple those reported by the bureau.   During the first five years of the Reagan administration, OSHAtargeted its inspectors on plants with higher-than-average injuryand illness rates. Critics said that merely gave employers anincentive to under-report them.   However, in the past two years, OSHA has levied hundreds offines, some of them in the millions of dollars, againstmanufacturers for not reporting job-related injuries or illnesses.   ``Over the short run, improved reporting will mean higher injuryand illness rates,'' said Assistant Labor Secretary John A.Pendergrass, who heads OSHA. ``But over the long run it shouldimprove workplace conditions.''   Diane Factor, an industrial hygienist for the AFL-CIO,acknowledged that part of the increase is likely due to betterrecords. But she said job-related illnesses and injuries are stillseverely under-reported, particularly in high-hazard industries likelogging and agriculture where OSHA has not targeted its enforcementresources.   ``Workmen's compensation data from several states, which is notdependent on employers' record-keeping, also show substantialincreases in injuries,'' Ms. Factor said. ``In Ohio, for example,the workmen's comp data show a 15 percent increase last year inconstruction injuries.''   The BLS data show a decline in construction injuries andillnesses, from 152 per every 1,000 workers in 1986 to 147 per 1,000last year. In every other industry, the incidence rate was eitherthe same or higher last year.   Of the 3,400 reported on-the-job fatalities last year, two-thirdsoccurred in the construction, manufacturing, transportation orpublic utility industries. As in previous years, the single biggestcause was traffic accidents, accounting for about one-third of thedeaths, the government said.   The highest incidence of injuries continued to be the lumber andwood products industry, at 186 per 1,000 workers, the same rate as1986. Second was the metal industry with an injury rate of 163 per1,000 workers, up from 133 per 1,000 a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
