(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Coleman Co. Inc. said Monday it had accepteda $545 million buyout offer from takeover strategist Ronald O.Perelman, who apparently outbid the company's founding family.   MacAndrews andamp; Forbes Holdings Inc., which is controlled byPerelman, agreed to pay $74 a share in cash for the company, whichis the maker of the famed Coleman lantern, other outdoor recreationequipment and home heating and air conditioning equipment.   The Coleman family, which controls about 27 percent of Coleman's7.1 million common shares outstanding, had offered $64 a share Feb.14 to take the company private in a debt-financed takeover.   Sheldon C. Coleman, the company's chairman and chief executive,is the grandson of company founder W.C. Coleman.   The family reportedly raised its offer to $68 per share during asealed-bid auction required by a special committee of the Colemanboard that was reviewing the bids.   Coleman stock rose $4.25 a share at $72.75 in heavy New YorkStock Exchange trading.   A number of analysts had speculated the family's initial overturemay have been an attempt to open the company to competing, higheroffers.   But the family indicated its buyout proposal was aimed atenabling it and senior management to focus on Coleman's long-terminterests. Family members also repeatedly said privately they wantedto retain control of the corporation.   Neither company would comment beyond a brief statement announcingthe deal. The statement did not indicate whether other bids werereceived.   The merger agreement was approved unanimously by the specialcommittee and by Coleman's board of directors.   Under the agreement, MacAndrews andamp; Forbes would begin a $74 ashare tender offer by Friday for all outstanding Coleman shares. Theoffer was conditioned on at least two-thirds of the shares beingtendered.   The deal also gives MacAndrews andamp; Forbes the option to acquire upto 18.5 percent of Coleman's outstanding common shares for $74 ashare, if those shares are needed to help satisfy the minimum tenderprovision, the companies said.   Coleman had record sales of $657.9 million and record earnings of$24.5 million in 1988.   In addition to lanterns, Coleman is one of the world's biggestmakers of outdoor recreation equipment such as coolers, sleepingbags and pop-up travel trailers. The company also makes airconditioning equipment, lawn movers, home and recreational vehicleheaters, air guns and electrical generators.   MacAndrews andamp; Forbes interests range from cosmetics and jewelry tocomic books and licorice extract.   It is controlled by Perelman, who became chairman of Revlon GroupInc. after leading a successful takeover fight for the cosmeticscompany and made a lucrative although unsuccessful run at GilletteCo., the personal products maker.   Late last year, a Perelman-led group put up $315 million and got$5.1 billion of government aid to acquire five bankrupt Texas thriftinstitutions with assets of more than $12 billion.   The Coleman family had indicated it might sell off the company'sheating and air conditioning products division to help pay for itsproposed leveraged buyout.   Analysts said Perelman also might want to sell part of thecompany's operations, but they doubted there would be a wholesalebreakup of Coleman.   ``So far, they haven't chopped up companies they've acquired,''said Harold Vogel, a Merrill Lynch analyst who follows Coleman.</TEXT></DOC>
