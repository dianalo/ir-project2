The service, releasing a preliminary damage estimate, saidrepairs to almost 200 helicopters would cost an estimated $585million and repairs to buildings and other facilities an estimated$15 million.   ``Detailed, exact cost repair figures are not available,'' saidLt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon. ``But ourpreliminary estimate now is that it will take about $600 million torepair the damage identified so far.''   The powerful storm, packing winds of 95 miles an hour, ravagedthe area May 13. Although there were no fatalities, the stormforced 25 military families from their quarters; damaged about 200military helicopters and damaged at least 20 percent of the fort'sbuildings.   The damage occurred even though the Army said 49 percent of thefort's helicopters had been placed inside hangars as the stormapproached and the rest secured and tied down.   Especially hard hit was the Army's new fleet of AH-64 attackhelicopters. Fort Hood is home to the Apache Training Brigade, andthe damage forced the base to downgrade its state of aviationreadiness.   About 100 of the fort's 150 Apaches were damaged, each built ata cost of $13.4 million. Of the 100, 30 to 35 were ``extensivelydamaged,'' according to the Army.   Chapla said today that the Army had not developed a timetablefor repairs nor did it know how the repairs would be financed.</TEXT></DOC>
