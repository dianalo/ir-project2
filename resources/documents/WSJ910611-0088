Ever faithful to the big government, bigbureaucracy point of view, George Mitchell (D., Maine),Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), John Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) andDonald Riegle (D., Mich.) propose to take a manageableproblem and turn it into a major disaster.   Under the bill's &quot;pay or play&quot; plan, employers would havea choice: pay a federal tax, tentatively set at about 7% ofpayroll, or provide health insurance to their workerscontaining core benefits defined in Washington. If employersdecide to pay the tax, government will assume responsibilityfor providing health insurance and employees will paypremiums that vary based on income level.</LP><TEXT>   For example, a $2,500 family health insurance premium fora worker earning $20,000 costs 13% of payroll, not 7%. Inthis case, the obvious choice for the employer is to pay thetax and turn the problem over to government. Indeed,considering that about 95% of all uninsured workers earn lessthan $30,000, in the vast majority of their cases employerswill have strong incentives to pay the tax rather than tobegin providing coverage themselves. (The cost of thecore-benefit package will vary depending on the benefitsincluded, and the age, occupation and geographical locationof employees. The $2,500 example is a very conservativenumber; the current average cost per employee in the U.S. is$3,217.)   This is not necessarily good news for the uninsured.Assuming uninsured employees are already paid a fair wage, a7% payroll tax means that their employers will have to cutwages by 7% or lay off workers. Since those earning theminimum wage can't by law take a wage cut, they stand thegreatest risk of becoming unemployed.   Employers who already provide health insurance to theiremployees also will compare the 7% tax with the cost of ahealth-insurance policy containing federally mandatedbenefits. A great many of them will be tempted to pay the taxand drop existing coverage. Nor is this mere speculation. AKennedy aide says the bill's sponsors expect this to happen.   Lee Iacocca will like this plan. For years he's wanted todump Chrysler's health-care costs on government, and theSenate Democrats are offering him a chance. Instead of payingwhat I estimate to be close to $4,000 per employee forprivate insurance, Mr. Iacocca could pay a tax of less than$3,000, have government provide each Chrysler worker withhealth insurance, and make a handsome profit. (If they haveany sense, Chrysler workers will resist this mightily.)   If employers decide to provide health insurance to theiremployees, they will be required under the bill to includemental-health benefits (the fastest-rising component ofhealth-care costs) and preventive procedures, includingmammograms, pap smears and well-child care (items for whichcosts double when the administrative costs of third-partyinsurers get factored in). The required out-of-pocketdeductible is only $250. Employers could charge a higherdeductible only if they provided additional benefits to thosein the core package -- not to cut costs.   Count on the benefits expanding and the costs rising oncethe special interests get their hands on the bill. Inresponse to provider pressures, state governments haveenacted more than 800 cost-increasing mandated benefits,requiring insurers to cover services ranging from acupunctureto in-vitro fertilization. All this means that individualshave to pay for coverage they do not want. Though the SenateDemocrats' bill would override these state mandates -- in anattempt to control costs -- the lobbyists can be expected tomove to Washington and continue their push for coverage ofmore and more services.   If employers exercise the option to pay the tax ratherthan provide health insurance, what happens to the workers?Rather than purchasing a private health insurance policy ontheir own, they will be required to join Medicaid. In fact,if you have any desire to toss away your private healthinsurance and join Medicaid, you'll love the SenateDemocrats' new health-care plan.   Granted, under the Democrats' plan Medicaid would bereorganized. It would also have a new name -- &quot;AmeriCare.&quot;But Medicaid under any name is still Medicaid.   In most places, Medicaid pays doctors and hospitals 50cents on the dollar -- sometimes even less. As a result,doctors increasingly won't see Medicaid patients and accessto hospital care is increasingly limited to charityhospitals.   Because Medicaid underpays, health-care rationing isinevitable. And more severe rationing is right around thecorner as the hospital marketplace becomes more competitive,cost-shifting to other patients becomes less feasible andgovernment at all levels has less money to spend. So far,only Oregon publicly admits that rationing in its Medicaidprogram is routine. Medical providers know the same thing ishappening in every state.   If readers get a sense of deja vu, it's probably becausethey have heard this before. The Senate Democrats haveendorsed the very plan that Michael Dukakis created forMassachusetts. Voters may recall Mr. Dukakis's 1988 boastthat everyone in Massachusetts had health insurance. Well,not quite. The Massachusetts Legislature wants to delay theprivate sector's entry into the program until 1994, and thecurrent governor wants to kill the whole program.   One problem is that government is inherently incapable ofadministering an insurance program that prices riskaccurately. Witness the deposit insurance debacle at thefederal level and the auto liability insurance crises inCalifornia, New Jersey and Massachusetts. In Massachusetts,auto insurance has become so politicized that any possibilityof rational premium prices has vanished and 65% of allpremiums now go to the state risk pool.   The Senate Democrats have already signaled they have nointerest in insurance prices based on real risks. The 7%payroll tax has no relationship to the actual cost of healthfor any particular employee. And they are proposing aquasi-cartel in the small-group health insurance market toguarantee that private insurance premiums won't reflect realrisks either. This will speed the exodus of people intoMedicaid (oops, AmeriCare), the risk pool of last resort.   A second problem both for Massachusetts and the SenateDemocrats is small business, which employs most of thenoninsured workers. Does it really make sense to heap newtaxes on small business -- the job-creating sector of theeconomy -- in the middle of a recession? One suspects thateven the senators would answer &quot;no.&quot;   In fact, one suspects they're not really serious about theproposal at all. The plan proposes a two-year grace periodfor new small businesses and a five-year grace period forfirms with fewer than 25 employees -- the firms where almosthalf of all uninsured workers are employed. Like Mr. Dukakis,the Senate Democrats propose to talk now and act later --definitely after the next election.   A third problem is health-care costs -- which are bound torise as more people acquire health insurance. InitiallySenate Democrats propose &quot;voluntary&quot; spending limits withtargets for the total amount spent on physicians fees andhospital services throughout the country. But since thenation's 5,000 hospitals and 500,000 doctors could notpossibly agree collectively on anything, the targets arebound to be missed, and &quot;voluntary&quot; will soon become&quot;mandatory.&quot;   This is precisely the approach taken in countries withnational health insurance, where governments set arbitrarybudgets for hospitals and area health authorities and forcethe providers to ration health care. The result is a lowerquality of care and more -- not less -- inefficiency.   While 700,000 people wait for surgery in Britain, at anyone time one of four hospital beds is empty. While 50,000people wait for surgery in New Zealand, one out of five bedsis empty. As the waiting lines grow in Canada, the politicsof bureaucracy determines who gets the next brain scan. Inall three countries, about one in every four hospital beds isfilled with the chronically ill elderly, using the hospitalas an expensive nursing home.   Bureaucratic health-care rationing is anything but fair.Although health care is theoretically free in England, 12% ofthe population now has private health insurance. In NewZealand's &quot;free&quot; health care system, one-third of thepopulation has private insurance and one-fourth of allsurgery is performed privately. In Canada, where privatehealth care has been virtually outlawed, the U.S. border isthe safety valve. For example, about 100 Canadians get heartsurgery every year at the Cleveland Clinic.   Before taxing small business to pay for an expandedMedicaid program with health-care rationing required bylimits on spending, the Senate Democrats should listen totheir colleague Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), author ofrefundable tax credits for the purchase of health insurance.Instead of pushing more people into a government rationingprogram, the Bentsen approach would empower low-incomefamilies and make them real participants in thehealth-insurance marketplace.   ---   Mr. Goodman is president of the National Center for PolicyAnalysis, a Dallas-based research institute.</TEXT></DOC>
