Eames is among 27 Anglican church leaders attending a weeklongconference in this Mediterranean tourist resort about 110 milesfrom Lebanon.   ``May I appeal to anyone who has control of Brian Keenan torelease him. To do so would win respect from the world outside,''Eames said in a written appeal.   Keenan, 38, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, an English-languageteacher at the American University of Beirut, disappeared whilewalking to work on April 11, 1986.   No organization claimed his abduction, but he is believed heldby pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists in Moslem-controlled westBeirut where 14 other foreigners are also held.   The other hostages are nine Americans, three Britons _ includingAnglican special envoy Terry Waite _ an Italian and a Belgian.American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, was seized on March 16, 1985, and is the longestheld hostage.   Eames said that ``as a churchman from Brian's home country Ihave joined with the other Anglican primates in urging the releaseof all hostages.   ``I write these words in the earnest hope that they may be readby someone who is in contact with Brian at this time ... In God'sname and in the name of justice and peace I appeal for hisrelease.''   The archbishops represent 70 million Anglicans worldwide. Suchmeetings are held every three years.</TEXT></DOC>
