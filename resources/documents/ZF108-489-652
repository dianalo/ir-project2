(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Ease of Use Coming To PC GraphicsandM;Unlike desktop publishing, which took off like a rocket in the mid-1980s, themarket for desktop presentation graphics is so far slow to get off theground.andP;  Where desktop publishing was propelled into the big time by thepotent duo of the Apple Mac and Aldus PageMaker desktop publishing software,the so-called desktop presentations market has yielded no such combustiblecombination of products.andP;  But don't count it out just yet.andM;According to William Coggshall, president of Desktop Presentations Inc., aMountain View, Calif., market research firm, yearly sales of presentationgraphics software for the combined IBM PC and Macintosh market are growingfast, although not at the hyperkinetic speeds of some other PC software.andO;Sales jumped from 530,000 units in 1987 to 950,000 units in 1989.andP;  Hepredicts this figure will reach 1.65 million by 1993.andM;Applications GaloreandM;If more of the over 35 million MS-DOS computers aren't being used to prepareslides and overheads, it's not for lack of applications software.andO;Presentation graphics packages range from single-purpose programs forproducing just graphs, charts or drawings to full-featured packages that cando everything connected to giving corporate presentations from producing 35mmcolor slides to aiding in speech writing.andP;  The three most popularfull-featured presentation packages are Software Publishing Corp.'s HarvardGraphics and Lotus Development Corp.'s Freelance Plus for IBM PCs andcompatibles, and Aldus Corp.'s Persuasion for the Mac.andM;These leading graphics packages output to a variety of printers and slidemakers, send slides or transparencies to remote service centers via modem ordisk for processing and use the computer itself (or in conjunction with aprojection device) to present on-screen video presentations.andM;Coggshall calls these screen-based presentations &quot;electronic glimpses&quot; andclaims they represent the fastest growing category of computer-generatedvisuals.andP;  In 1989, Coggshall estimates, computers were responsible forcreating 245 million transparencies, 157 million slides and 59 millionelectronic glimpses.andP;  He forecasts that these numbers will grow to 936million transparencies, 316 million slides and 284 million electronicglimpses by 1993 and that by 1995 screen-based images will exceed the numberof computer-generated slides produced.andM;Mary Grant, training manager for Northland Insurance Cos.andP;  in St. Paul, is abeliever in the electronic glimpse concept.andP;  She has been using HarvardGraphics to create PC-based presentations for the past three years.andP;  Themajority of her creations are employee training programs.andP;  However, theavailability of a BARCO color projector and SilentPartner, a device forremotely controlling the computer, has made the training room a popular placefor presenting computer-based visuals as an attractive alternative to slidesor overhead transparencies.andM;&quot;If someone will be making a presentation away from the site, we'll prepareslides--we have an ImageMaker slide printer hooked up to our PC--but wheneverwe do a presentation in our own training facility, it's easier and moreefficient for us to do a computer-based show,&quot; says Grant.andM;Another device that is likely to encourage the use of on-screen presentationsis the recently introduced 480C PC Viewer from In Focus Systems Inc., whichthe company claims is the first true color liquid crystal display (LCD)panel.andP;  The device, which retails for $4,995, sits on top of an overheadprojector and reflects whatever appears on the computer screen.andP;  It supportsup to 640 X 480 dot-per-inch resolution output from an IBM PC, compatible orMacintosh.andM;In Focus also markets a standard monochrome LCD panel and, for people whowant to take their presentations but leave their computers at home when theytravel, the 480GS/2.andP;  This monochrome memory-and-store LCD panel storespresentations created with a computer and then runs them through an overheadprojector directly from the panel, without need of a computer.andM;The Joy of StandardsandM;Although the impressive number of software and hardware products on themarket for presentation graphics provides users with an exciting diversity ofchoices, it also leaves the people who must support and integrate thesepackages--many of which are based on proprietary file formats--under aconsiderable burden.andP;  IS managers are moving slowly into graphics because ofperceived support costs and lack of standards in both hardware and software.andM;Some of the concerns are being addressed by software manufacturers, many ofwhich continue to provide increasing numbers of drivers for local outputdevices and remote service bureaus, thereby reducing the need for managers tolimit users to a particular software package or file format.andP;  Still,standardizing can offer a number of benefits, including more cost-effectiveuse of shared resources, fewer support calls and uniformity of presentationgraphics.andM;For example, everyone at the Iselin, N.J., offices of Engelhard Corp., aFortune 500 company specializing in chemical technology, uses HarvardGraphics to create their presentations.andP;  This makes it possible for employeesto share the company's four Matrix PCR film recorders (PC-operateddevices--comparable to Matrix's SlideWriter for the Macintosh--that convertimages on a computer screen into 35mm slides) in much the same way they wouldshare a departmental photocopy machine.andM;Access to the in-house film recorders has both simplified and sped up thecreation of slides, says Michele Grembowicz, a systems analyst withEngelhard's Presentation and Decision Support Group.andP;  Anyone who needs slidescreates them at his or her desk with Harvard Graphics, saves the work to afloppy, brings that floppy to one of the centrally located film recorders,pops it into the attached PC (which already has the Matrix software loadedonto it) that sends the data to the film recorder.andP;  The user then unloads theexposed film from the recorder and sends it to a local company, whichprocesses and returns the mounted slides--within a few hours, if necessary.andM;&quot;Initially, we have to provide employees with one-on-one instruction on howto load the camera and use the Matrix software, but people require verylittle additional hardware support after that,&quot; says Grembowicz.andM;When Engelhard decided to institute a uniform slide format for budgetpresentations in 1988, being standardized on a single software platform madethe transition relatively easy, says Pat Benanti, an executive secretary whodesigned the templates and training materials to implement the change.andP;  &quot;Wehad 50 people--most of whom had received their software training severalmonths earlier, many of whom had not yet attempted to create their ownslides, and none of whom had ever had to design slides to specification--allworking on deadline at the same time.andP;  I thought I would be swamped withcalls, but I got very few,&quot; recalls Benanti.andM;Not Always What You WantandM;For Engelhard, having everyone using the same software guaranteed uniformityof output from the Matrix film recorder.andP;  Other companies outputting visualsto a variety of different devices may not be so lucky, however.andP;  &quot;What youwant is not always what you get, even when you're dealing with the same fileformat,&quot; says Sam Bayer, developer of the Scan Conversion Object DescriptionLanguage (SCODL), a file format used to translate the PC screen image for theMatrix film recorders.andM;Bayer, who is also director of marketing at the Orangeburg, N.Y.-based AgfaMatrix Division of Agfa Corp., believes that SCODL hasn't lived up to itspotential for a variety of reasons.andP;  &quot;SCODL ought to take a lot of theconfusion out of the industry, but because the various software vendors seemto put a little bit of their own personality into the way they support theexisting formats, not every SCODL on the software side is the same,&quot; he says.andO;Consequently, a SCODL file generated in one program often appears differentlywhen loaded into another, even though Matrix film recorders can generateslides from all SCODL files.andM;Bayer recently formed the Agfa Imaging Center Association, an organization hesays is helping to ameliorate this problem by acting as a liaison betweenpeople with imaging problems and the software companies.andM;Lack of standards is also a problem when exchanging graphics among varioussoftware packages used to create the images prior to output.andP;  The closestthing to universal graphics formats are the computer graphics metafile (CGM)on the PC and PICT on the Macintosh, formats many packages can import andexport.andP;  However, even CGM files tend to differ from program to program, andwhen files are moved surprises are possible.andP;  Part of the text may bemissing, only part of a graphic may appear or the colors can be off.andO;Although most programs can read PICT files, the look of the graphics maychange as files move between programs because of the differences in formatsor style sheets within the programs.andM;Several software companies are addressing the problem of fileincompatibility.andP;  Micrografx Inc. recently announced XPort, a translationengine, which will initially provide translations between CGM, PICT1, PICT2,AutoCAD's DXF, Digital Research Inc.'s GEM and Micrografx's own DRW formats.andM;Inset Systems Inc.'s upcoming HiJaak2 conversion utility, which should be outthis summer, is expected to add vector conversions to the already extensivelist of graphics translators in the current version of HiJaak.andP;  DigitalResearch also announced a licensing agreement with Inset Systems that willallow Digital Research to incorporate conversion utilities for importing andexporting files in the Adobe EPS, CGM, DXF, GEM, Lotus PIC, MicrosoftWindows, TIF, WMF and Z-Soft PCX file formats into its entire line of GEMgraphics programs.andM;For managers who have to deal with it, the issue of disparate graphicsformats and file incompatibility can present frustrating and eveninsurmountable problems.andP;  But, then again, only about 10% of IBM PC andcompatible users today are using their computers to create graphics, and evenfewer are preparing the kinds of sophisticated graphics that involve dealingwith multiple file formats.andM;&quot;While we in the computer industry are dazzling one another with spectacularcolor images and weighing the subtle differences in speed or ease of usewhich make one presentation software package superior to another, most of theworld doesn't even realize this technology exists,&quot; says David Peltz,publisher of the &quot;Macintosh Engineering and Scientific Report&quot; and presidentof CADventures, a Chatsworth, Calif., computer graphics consulting firm.andM;According to Peltz, the most popular presentation in use today is ablack-and-white transparency that's gone through the Xerox machine to make anoverhead.andP;  &quot;Presentations, for the most part, are still a monochrome world.andO;If I take even the simplest color transparency or slide and use it outsidethe computer community, the first reaction I get is almost invariably 'Wow,how did you do that?'&quot; says Peltz.andM;Even many experienced computer users prefer not to deal with the complicatedissues involved in designing presentation graphics or working with color.andO;According to a survey by PC Week magazine, one of the most sought afterqualities in a presentation graphics package is preformatted templates.andM;&quot;Most of the time, when I sit down at my Macintosh to start a newpresentation, I just grab one of the templates that came with [MicrosoftCorp.'s] Power-Point, save it with my file name, and start cutting andpasting into that outline.andP;  It's just such an easy way to do it,&quot; says RobertLucas, a project leader for software developer Applied Computer Services Inc.andO;of Simi Valley, Calif.andM;The Power of PersuasionandM;Another package packed with predrawn presentation templates--AldusPersuasion--has become the standard for Macintosh users at FMC Corp., a largemultinational company in the agricultural, industrial chemical anddefense-contracting businesses.andM;&quot;The people preparing presentations here are typically managers,professionals, knowledge workers and secretaries--people who have had verylittle training in what looks good with what,&quot; says Christine Leatz, FMC'sChicago-based manager of office technology worldwide.andP;  Not only do FMCemployees make heavy use of Persuasion's packaged templates but in-housegraphic artists have developed special FMC templates of their own featuringthe FMC logo.andP;  These have been distributed throughout the company.andM;&quot;We're not so much concerned about our presentations being uniform as we arethat our logo be the right color and size and be placed in the rightposition.andP;  We also have strict security guidelines and need to be sure peopleinclude the appropriate information, such as copyright, on their slides,&quot;says Leatz.andM;One of the reasons Leatz decided to standardize on Persuasion was the factthat a Microsoft Windows-based version is expected out soon for the PC.andP;  &quot;Ourpeople on PCs are currently using Harvard Graphics and Lotus Freelance, butwe've found that these require a far greater amount of MIS support thanPersuasion because they're not Windows-based and don't use a graphical userinterface,&quot; says Leatz.andM;AWindows version of Microsoft PowerPoint is expected out soon, and it seemslikely that the porting of easier-to-use Macintosh products to MicrosoftWindows on the PC will be a continuing trend.andP;  Then, the pending release ofMicrosoft Windows 3.0 should open the market to many new graphics products,including presentation packages.andM;Still a Support FunctionandM;But even with easy-to-use software on the horizon, there's no guarantee thatdesktop presentations will ever become as popular as spreadsheets or wordprocessing.andP;  Part of the problem, particularly among PC-compatible users, isthat--unlike in the case of desktop publishing--the majority of the peoplewho need presentation graphics are not the people who prepare them.andP;  Thepreparation of visuals continues to be largely a support function, and thisis not likely to change.andM;Says CADventures' Peltz: &quot;When word processing came out, you had WP pools.andO;Everybody wrote things down on paper and took it to the pool.andP;  Presentationsare still for the most part that way.andP;  Instead of a WP pool, there's the artdepartment.&quot;andM;What will change is the availability of graphics-capable hardware on thetypical desktop.andP;  As computer hardware prices continue to come down--and morepowerful, higher resolution graphics-based systems increasingly replaceolder, less functional equipment--many analysts expect to see a commensurateincrease in the number of presentations being created on the desktop.andM;The ability to run presentation software over a network should furtheraccelerate widespread use of graphics.andP;  Lotus recently announced that anetwork version of Freelance Plus will be available in the second quarter ofthis year.andP;  Digital Research is also expected to release a networked versionof its Presentation Team product fairly soon.andP;  Networkable software makes iteasier for an administrator to do maintenance updates and ensure thateveryone is using the same version of the software.andP;  It will also give usersthe ability to share expensive output devices.andM;Whether it is the nature of presenters to procrastinate or simply a desire toprovide the most up-to-the-minute data, the preparation of presentationmaterials remains a rush-rush affair.andP;  It is probably this, more thananything else, that will fuel the demand for desktop control of presentationgraphics.andP;  After all, how many art departments can you find open at 3:00 inthe morning?andP;  And how long can you wait for changes when your presentation isonly hours away?andM;Donna Barron is a freelance writer based in Hollywood, Fla., who covers thecomputer industry.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
