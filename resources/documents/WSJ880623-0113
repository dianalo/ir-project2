It is a reform in style.    During this term of court, Justice O'Connor has been writing majority opinions that are noteworthy in three respects. First, they contain no footnotes. Second, they are succinct. Third, they are clear.    I first observed this in an opinion delivered by Justice O'Connor on Jan. 12, 1988. The opinion contained no numbered footnotes and was less than six printed pages in the Supreme Court Reporter. Similar brevity without footnotes has been repeated in her opinions subsequently.    The primary purpose of Supreme Court opinions is to account for the exercise of judicial power and to explain the basis of the judgment. In a system such as ours, in which the Supreme Court makes law in wholesale fashion and charts the major reforms of our society, it is essential that the judgments of the court be set forth in a manner that makes them understandable to the American people in general, and not just to lawyers.    The typical opinion of the Supreme Court is so long and verbose, so filled with legalese synonyms, so encrusted with substantive footnotes, so totally unclear and inconsistent in the use of legal terms of art that only the devoted professional can hope to follow and understand what is going on. In fact, it has been said that Supreme Court opinions are so long and obscure that by the time the reader wades through the river of words he doesn't care how the case turns out. The result is that the American people are separated by this wall of words from any real understanding of what the court is doing. Thus, the obligation of the court to account to the general population for the exercise of such great power is substantially frustrated. The public goes on faith, which history proves is not enough in the face of concentrated power in the hands of a few.    Justice O'Connor has embarked on a new course that can be of historic value to the nation. She is evidently trying to write for a large audience, and not for a handful of technicians. The value of omitting footnotes is most helpful in maintaining the continuity of reader comprehension. If one must stop in the middle of a paragraph to read a note at the bottom of the page, it is often necessary to start reading over again in the main text in order to pick up the basic idea that is under discussion. Logically, if the footnote is truly relevant it should be included in the text itself.    Footnotes, of course, are impressive to the lay reader. They give the impression of authority and the reflection of research. But they have become a fetish in the American legal mind and it is time that they should go, at least when they contain substantive content.    It would be great if the first woman justice should be the first justice to attempt this reform and to bring the rest of us along by the example of her good sense and singular boldness. Her model is of special value to journalists who carry the prime task in our democracy of informing the American people.    W.
