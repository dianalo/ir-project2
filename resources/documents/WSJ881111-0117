Woody F. Lemons of Vernon, Texas, was chairman and chief executive officer of the troubled thrift from 1982 until April 1986. Federal regulators closed Vernon in November 1987 and committed $1.3 billion to reopen it as Montfort Savings Association, in one of the most expensive restructurings ever. About 96% of the loans were delinquent when federal regulators took over the thrift in March 1987.    The indictment, among other things, charges Mr. Lemons with arranging an inflated $46 million loan to buy and develop property in Arlington, Texas, and alleges that he received a share of the loan from an intermediate seller of the property.    Mr. Lemons's lawyer said Mr. Lemons will plead not guilty and said, &quot;We look forward to establishing his innocence in trial.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
