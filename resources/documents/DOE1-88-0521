The hyperfine-field results in these alloys are discussedin terms of two models, the localized moment model and the Volume Overlapmodel. In the localized moment model a pre-asymptotic phase factor n= {pi} at distance r = a/2 was used to fit the experimental results onCo{sub 2}YZ (Y = Ti, V, Zr and Z = Al, Ga, Sn, Ge). In the Volume Overlapmodel the hyperfine field results in the series Co{sub 2}MnZ (Z = Ge,Si, Sn) was plotted against the lattice parameter of these alloys; alinear relationship was found, suggesting a non overlap term betweenthe magnetic atom and the nonmagnetic impurity. A prediction of hyperfinemagnetic filed less than 40 (kOe) on Sn-119 and of about -250(kOe) onCd-111 in Co{sub 2}TiSi and Co{sub 2}TiGe is made. Temperature variationof the hyperfine magnetic field in the alloy Co{sub 2}MnSn with magneticmoments residing on two sites, has been studied. Results didn't showa dramatic deviation form the Brillouin function.</TEXT></DOC>
