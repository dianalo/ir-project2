 The use ofgeneral-purpose instrumentation in automated measurement systems has steadilygrown over the past decade.andP;  While early users of programmable instrumentswere elated to be able to automate costly, tedious, error-prone measurementsor characterization processes, the sophistication and needs of today's usersare orders of magnitude greater.andP;  The computing power of instrumentcontrollers has increased manyfold since the mid-1970s and so have userexpectations for the performance of measurement systems.andP;  Test efficiency inmany applications is no longer limited by the device under test or theinstrument controller's horsepower.andP;  Often either the configuration speed orthe measurement speed of the test instrumentation has become the limitingfactor for achieving greater test throughput.andP;  In many systems, the DMM isrequired to perform hundreds of measurements and be capable of multiplefunctions with various resolutions and accuracies.andM;In some applications, several DMMs may be required to characterize a singledevice.andP;  For example, measurements requiring high precision may need a slowerDMM with calibration laboratory performance.andP;  Usually, the majority ofmeasurements can be satisfied by the faster, moderate-resolution capabilitiesof a traditional system DMM.andP;  In extreme cases, where speed or sample timingare critical to the application, a lower-resolution high-speed DMM may berequired.andP;  A single digital multimeter capable of fulfilling this broad rangeof measurement capabilities can reduce system complexity and developmentcosts.andP;  If it also provides shorter reconfiguration time and increasedmeasurement speed, test throughput can also be improved for automated testapplications.andM;The HP 3458A Digital Multimeter (Fig.andP;  1) was developed to address theincreasing requirements for flexible, accurate, and cost-effective solutionsin today's automated test applications.andP;  The product concept centers upon thesynergistic application of state-of-the-art technologies to meet these needs.andO;While it is tuned for high throughput in  computer-aided testing, the HP3458A also offers calibration laboratory accuracy in dc volts, ac volts, andresistance.andP;  Owners can trade speed for resolution, from 100,000 measurementsper second with 4-1/2-digit (16-bit) resolution to six measurements persecond with 8-1/2-digit resolution.andP;  At 5-1/2-digit resolution, the DMMachieves 50,000 readings per second.andP;  To maximize the measurement speed forthe resolution selected, the integration time is selectable from 500nanoseconds to one second in 100-ns steps.andP;  The effect is an almostcontinuous range of speed-versus-resolution trade-offs.andM;Measurement CapabilitiesandM;Measurement ranges for the HP 3458A's functions are:andM;* Voltage: 10 nV to 1000V dc andless;1 mV to 700V rms acandM;* Current: 1 pA to 1A dc 100 pA to 1A rms acandM;* Resistance: 10 [mu] [omega] to G[omega], 2-wire or 4-wireandM;* Frequency: 1 Hz to 10 MHzandM;* Period: 100 ns to 1 sandM;* 16-bit digitizing at effective sample rates to 100 megasamples/second.andM;The ac voltage bandwidth is 1 Hz to 10 MHz, either ac or dc coupled.andM;To increase uptime, the HP 3458A is capable of two-source electroniccalibration and self-verifying autocalibration.andP;  Autocalibration enhancesaccuracy by eliminating drift errors with time and temperature.andP;  The dcvoltage stability is specified at eight parts per million over one year, or 4ppm with the high-stability option.andP;  Linearity is specified at 0.1 ppm,transfer accuracy at 0.1 ppm, and rms internal noise at 0.01 ppm.andP;  Maximumaccuracies are 0.5 ppm for 24 hours in dc volts and 100 ppm in ac volts.andO;Midrange resistance and direct current accuracies are 3 ppm and 10 ppm,respectively.andM;The HP 3458A can transfer 16-bit readings to an HP 9000 Series 200 or 300Computer via the HP-IB (IEEE 488, IEC 625) at 100,000 readings per second.andO;It can change functions or ranges and deliver a measurement 200 times persecond (over 300/s from the internal program memory), about four times fasterthan any earlier HP multimeter.andM;The following five articles describe the technologies required to achievethis performance and the benefits that result.andP;  In the first paper, thedevelopment of a single analog-to-digital converter capable of both highresolution and high speed is discussed.andP;  The second paper describes thedevelopment of a technique for the precise measurement of rms ac voltages.andO;The application of these technologies to provide improved measurementaccuracy over extended operating conditions and to provide completecalibration of the DMM from only two external traceable sources (10V dc, 10k[omega]) is discussed in the third article.andP;  Hardware and firmware design toachieve increased measurement throughput is the topic of the fourth paper.andO;The final paper discusses several applications for the HP 3458A's ability toperform high-resolution, high-speed digitizing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
