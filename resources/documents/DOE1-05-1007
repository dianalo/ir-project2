The rapid reduction in computing hardware costsin recent years, coupled with fundamental improvements in computing systemsdesign, has led to the development of a new generation of test controlsystems. The paper focuses on recent developments in this area at theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The paper describes in detaila microcomputer-based controller designed to be used with a standardservohydraulic test frame. The controller uses menu-driven software whichpermits the operator to set up and execute tests, sample and store data,and transfer the collected data to a host computer system for data reductionand archival storage. Currently, software exists to perform standardlow-cycle fatigue tests and other related test procedures. The softwareis designed to permit east of operation and reduce the chance of operatorerror. In addition, numerous checks are performed during the course ofa test to assure that the test is carried out in accord with ASTM specificationswhere applicable. The paper contains a discussion of digital communicationsas they relate to the materials testing laboratory. The growing arrayof computing hardware in the testing laboratory necessitates the carefulselection of communication techniques to match the needs of each applicationand the laboratory as a whole. The paper concludes with a discussionof the impact of new testing techniques on testing standards.</TEXT></DOC>
