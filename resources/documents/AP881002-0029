The Indiana senator said in a weekend interview with TheAssociated Press that he's not worried about making any of hiscelebrated gaffes during the nationally televised debate at Omaha,Neb., on Wednesday, although ``there's always that possibility.''   Sounding confident about the confrontation with his Democraticcounterpart, Quayle said: ``I will be prepared. I'll be ready.''   The GOP vice presidential nominee said he will target hisattacks on Dukakis rather than Bentsen, the Texas senator whoseviews Quayle said are more in tune with Republicans than Democrats.   ``The opponent for me is Michael Dukakis,'' Quayle said. ``He'sthe one that's running for president. He's the one that if he wouldget in, I think it'd be very difficult time for this country. ...My target and my discussion and my focus that evening will be onthe governor from Massachusetts.''   Quayle and Bentsen, home in Texas, are spending the next twodays making final preparations for their debate. Dukakis embarksMonday on a campaign tour of major industrial states, includingMichigan, Illinois, and Ohio, while GOP nominee George Bush fliesto California to greet the Discovery space shuttle astronauts whenthey land at Edwards Air Force Base.   On Wednesday night, Quayle will field the first question fromthe panel of journalists. He admitted he is somewhat nervous butsaid ``the butterflies will be gone when I get out there.''   Quayle is most comfortable speaking extemporaneously with thehelp of a few notecards. ``Public speaking is very easy,'' he said.   Quayle's campaign as Bush's running mate has been dogged byintense media scrutiny into his military service, academic recordand personal life, and he occasionally has responded with highlypublicized misstatements.   He said his malapropisms, usually uttered when he is not readinga prepared text, have been blown out of proportion.   ``When you make as many speeches and you talk as much as I doand you get away from the text, it's always a possiblity to get afew words tangled here and there but it's a very small number ofmiscues,'' he said.   Quayle said he is not worried about slipups on Wednesday.   ``The reason I'm not is because it's going to be questions andanswers. There's always that possibility, but I'm a very confidentperson,'' he said.   Campaign strategists have said that because Quayle has beenportrayed as a lightweight candidate, anything short of a majorblunder during the debate will allow him to surpass the lowexpectations for his performance.   ``I'm treating it as an opportunity to get up there, respond tothe questions, tell the American people where I want to lead thiscountry with George Bush ... and articulate a vision for thefuture,'' Quayle said.   ``So I don't look at it as low expectations, high expectations.I'll leave that to others. What I perceive this debate as is agolden opportunity for me to just be myself,'' he said.   His aides say they have advised Quayle, 41, to tone down hisboyish exuberance so he will appear dignified and mature beside the67-year-old Bentsen. Quayle has been coached to speak more slowlyand curb his hand gestures during the debate.   Quayle said he is not worried about being compared unfavorablywith Bentsen.   ``Age alone is not the only qualification for vice president orpresident. You have to look at experience, you've got to look atjudgment, you've got to look if you can make a difference,'' hesaid.   ``I believe I can make a difference ... like I have made adifference in areas like job training and national defense.''   Quayle says his debate with Bentsen will have some impact on theelectorate, but how much is uncertain.   ``When they go in that voting booth they're going to be votingfor a president of the United States, and that's where theirattention is going to be and that's where the election is going tobe decided,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
