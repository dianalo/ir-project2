He awaits a December trial on chargesof murder and attempted murder.;    &quot;There are people out there who thrive oninteraction with mass murderers,&quot; said Public Defender Randall Martin,Ramirez's attorney. &quot;It's really sick.&quot;;    The night-stalker case dominatedLos Angeles headlines in the summer of 1985. Ramirez entered homes at nightthrough unlocked doors and windows, bludgeoning, raping and shooting hisvictims, who ranged in age from 16 to 83.;    Ramirez was captured that Augustafter a group of residents recognized him and chased him down the street,pummeling him until police arrived.;    In addition to 13 murder convictions,Ramirez was found guilty of rape, sodomy, oral copulation, burglary andattempted murder. He was sentenced to die in the gas chamber. That case is onappeal.;    Deputies say Ramirez now gets about eight to 10 visitors a week.;   Ramirez, a lanky man with shaggy, shoulder-length brown hair, talks tovisitors by telephone through a thick glass barrier. No contact is allowed.;   Ramirez's visiting hours were recently cut to one day a month until Oct. 18because of a jailhouse infraction, said Dyer, who would not elaborate.;   Some visitors have been turned away because of the number of requests. Eachinmate is allowed only two visiting days per week. Each visitor gets 20minutes. Only one visitor is allowed at a time.;    &quot;Their conversationsaren't monitored so we don't know what they talk about,&quot; Dyer said. &quot;But webelieve they're mostly women who don't know him. That's assumed because it'stoo many to be just friends of family.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NOEL K.
