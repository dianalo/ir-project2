The team, sent by the International Atomic Energy Agencyin Vienna in accordance with Iraq's cease-fire agreement,reported that the material &quot;exactly equals the amountpreviously known to the agency,&quot; said Robert Gallucci, deputychairman of the U.N. Special Commission overseeing thecease-fire agreement.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're very satisfied with the results of the inspection,&quot;added a U.S. official. He said the inspection team willreturn to Vienna today and prepare for the IAEA's secondmission, which will be to take custody of the material, placeit in radiation-shielded containers and remove it from Iraq.   Although allied bombing of several buildings at the mainIraqi nuclear research center at Tuwaitha was found to havecaused extensive damage, only about 30 pounds of the highlyenriched uranium was found underneath rubble. About 60 poundsof the fuel had been removed for safety to nearby locations,which also were visited by IAEA inspectors, according to anofficial.   Mr. Gallucci said Iraqi officials were very cooperativewith the inspectors, who examined the fuel and then placedseals on the containers where it was found. &quot;We've got a longway to go,&quot; said Mr. Gallucci, whose commission is preparinga team of experts to examine Iraqi chemical weapons sites inJune.   &quot;But the important part for us in this is that in the verybeginning we're getting cooperation from Iraq,&quot; he added.Under the cease-fire agreement, Iraq must carry out thedestruction of its missile facilities under U.N. supervision,he noted.</TEXT></DOC>
