China can only sell a little.It is only a small fraction of what the United States has sold,''Defense Minister Qin Jiwei said.   China's sales of missiles to Middle East nations, includingSilkworm missiles to Iran, have been criticized by the UnitedStates.   According to U.S. figures, China sold about $2 billion worth ofarms last year, mainly to developing countries. China does notprovide information on its arms sales.   Qin said China and other Third World countries sell onlyconventional arms ``but the United States is selling advanced armssuch as the F-16'' jet fighter. ``We can't compare the two kinds ofarms,'' he said.   Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Xin, also talking to reporters in theGreat Hall of the People, insisted China strictly regulates itsarms sales. ``First, they are for defense. Second, they are formaintaining stability and peace, not war,'' he said.   Earlier Tuesday the American national anthem echoed off the graywalls of the Chinese Military Museum as China's top militaryleaders welcomed Carlucci on his first official visit.   Carlucci, accompanied by Qin, reviewed a 120-member honor guardfrom the People's Liberation Army.   Carlucci arrived Monday for a five-day visit to discussinternational and bilateral issues.   China is expected to call on the United States to removerestrictions on technology transfers and approve export licensesfor U.S. companies wanting to use Chinese Long March missiles tolaunch satellites.   Use of the Chinese missiles has been opposed by U.S. defenseofficials concerned about giving China access to U.S. satellitetechnology.   Regional conflicts in Afghanistan and Cambodia and the Sovietmilitary stance in the Far East are also likely to be discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
