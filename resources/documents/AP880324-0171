(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women may have a better chance ofbeing cured of breast cancer by surgery if they undergo theoperation at the right time in their menstrual cycle, a study ofmice suggests.   Even post-menopausal women, who get the most breast cancers,might be helped if such an effect is found and studied in humans,said researcher William Hrushesky of the University of Minnesota.   If scientists could tailor a woman's treatment to reproducefactors responsible for higher cure rates, ``we could do that inany woman, whether she was pre- or post-menopausal,'' Hrusheskysaid.   Breast cancer will appear in 135,000 American women this yearand kill 42,000. Surgery can remove the tumor, but cancer cellsthat escaped before surgery can cause recurrence elsewhere in thebody.   Hrushesky described the mouse experiment Wednesday at a sciencewriters seminar sponsored by the American Cancer Society. The workfocused on the 5{-day mouse estrous cycle, which corresponds to themonthly menstrual cycle in women.   Tumors that grow faster in response to the hormone estrogen, asmany human breast tumors do, were implanted in the mice. Lateranalysis showed the timing of the implant in the estrous cycle madeno difference in cure rates.   But the timing of surgery to remove the tumors markedlyinfluenced the likelihood that cancer would have spread to thelungs by 28 days after the operation, Hrushesky said.   Sixteen of 60 mice that underwent surgery near the fertilitypeak of the cycle were found to be free of lung involvement,compared with nine of 73 that had surgery during the infertilephase.   That translates to 27 percent versus 12.3 percent. Under adifferent method to determine estrous stage, the percentages cameto 31.3 percent and 14.9 percent.   In human terms, the higher cure rate corresponds to surgery justbefore and during ovulation, with the lower rate corresponding tosurgery around menstruation, Hrushesky said.   In the mice, fluctuation in the cure rate mirrored changes inactivity levels of ``splenocyte natural killer'' cells, whichattack cancer cells that have spread from tumors, he said. But thatdoes not prove the cells play a role in the findings, he said.   Hrushesky said he had no detailed explanation for the results.The trauma of surgery may affect the balance between cancer and thedisease-fighting immune system differently at different times inthe estrous cycle, he said.   He emphasized the results do not imply that cancer cells arespread from the tumor by surgery.   The next step is studying hospital records for evidence of anyprotective pattern in past surgeries, and following the progress ofwomen after they have breast cancer surgery at known points in themenstrual cycle, he said.   ``Within a few years we may know if this is true in humanbeings,'' he said.   ``It certainly deserves study. I think it will get it,'' saidBenjamin Byrd Jr., clinical professor of surgery at VanderbiltUniversity Medical School.   Byrd said the evidence so far does not convince him that thestress of surgery plays a role, but that hormone levels may.   ``This is a whole new look'' at appraising or altering immunesytem response to cancer, said Byrd, a past president of the cancersociety.   Hrushesky also said a chemotherapy schedule tailored to thenatural day-long rhythms of the body prolonged survival in 50people with cancer that had spread from the kidney.   Patients received a continuous drug infusion with the dosepeaking every night. That let them tolerate twice as much drug perweek than if the dose level were fixed, Hrushesky said.</TEXT></DOC>
