Thousands of people, many chanting for the death of the leaderof President Alfredo Cristiani's governing party, marched throughdowntown in a funeral procession for six of the 10 victims of theattack.   ``Because the color of blood is never forgotten, our slaincompanions will be avenged!'' shouted the unionists and studentscarrying wreaths and banners denouncing Cristiani's government.   ``Death to D'Aubuisson!'' shouted the marchers, referring toRoberto D'Aubuisson, founder and honorary president of Cristiani'sRepublican Nationalist Alliance. Human rights advocates considerD'Aubuisson the mastermind of rightist death squads that in theearly 1980s killed thousands of suspected leftists.   Leftist groups blame the administration and the military for thebombing Tuesday. Military spokesmen have rejected the leftists'accusation and promised to investigate and punish thoseresponsible. No one claimed responsibility.   Soldiers and police stayed well away during most of the march.The only incident occurred when a soldier tossed a tear-gas grenadeat the rear of a march, leaving a few dozen demonstrators cryingand coughing.   In a radio broadcast, the Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront guerrillas said they will not take part in the next round ofnegotiations until the government offers better guarantees for thesurvival of leftist organizations.   Representatives of the two sides in the decade-old civil warwere scheduled to hold their third meeting this year on Nov. 20-21in Caracas, Venezuela.   Earlier meetings in Mexico City and San Jose, Costa Rica, haddeadlocked, but the two sides had agreed to continue meetingmonthly until a cease-fire was negotiated.   There was no immediate government reaction to the guerrillastatement. Government offices were closed for the Day of the Deadholiday, and an employee at the home of the government presssecretary said he was out of town.   In the broadcast over private radio station YSU, the guerrillassaid they had information the bomb attack Tuesday that killed 10people and wounded 29 was planned and carried out by the militaryin retaliation for a guerrilla attack Monday on the DefenseMinistry.   The statement said Gen. Rene Ponce, military chief of staff,approved attacks ``which were known and authorized by PresidentCristiani and were executed by Col. (Francisco) Elena Fuentes,commander of the shady 1st Infantry Brigade squadron.''   The guerrillas gave no details to back up their assertion.   The rebels said they were withdrawing from the talks in ordernot to legitimize the ``government's responsibility for themassacre.''   The downtown hall belonging to the National Federation ofSalvadoran Workers, known by its Spanish initials as Fenastras, waspartially destroyed by the blast.   Another bomb earlier Tuesday injured four people at the officeof Madres, an organization of relatives of political prisoners.   Two Americans were slightly injured in the blasts.   On Wednesday, rebels fired two anti-tank weapons at theheadquarters of the 1st Brigade, killing one civilian and woundinganother.   More than 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been slain inthe civil war.   President Bush on Thursday condemned recent violence ``fromextremists from both the left and the right'' but said Cristiani'sgovernment ``continues in the democratic path'' of formerSalvadoran president Jose Napolean Duarte.   Bush spoke at a ceremony honoring Duarte at Walter Reed MedicalCenter in Washington, where the former Salvadoran leader ishospitalized with terminal cancer.   In March, voters elected Cristiani over the candidate of thethen-governing Christian Democratic Party. Cristiani replacedDuarte, who by law could not run for re-election.</TEXT></DOC>
