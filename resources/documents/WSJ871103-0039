The Kuwaiti News Agency said several Arab members of OPEC have called on the cartel to raise its crude-oil production to at least 17.5 million barrels a day from its current quota of 16.6 million barrels.    The members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- also insisted that official OPEC prices shouldn't exceed the current level of $18 a barrel, the news agency said.    &quot;It was a double whammy,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy-futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.    The report signaled the opening salvo in what appears will be a contentious meeting during which the 13-member cartel will grapple with price and production issues. Four OPEC members -- Iran, Libya, Algeria and Nigeria -- have called for at least a $2 price increase while opposing any higher output. The ministerial conference is to begin Dec. 9 in Vienna.    Crude-oil prices for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped 34 cents a barrel to $19.62. The last time crude-oil prices for current delivery were lower was Oct. 8, when they stood at $19.59. Petroleum-product prices, particularly gasoline, also fell yesterday.    On the spot, or noncontract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, fell 35 cents, to $19.60. The spot price of North Sea Brent, a barometer of European crude prices, fell 15 cents a barrel, to $18.60 in late trading.    The newswire reports took some traders by surprise, analysts said. &quot;Part of the market's general uptrend since late August was the expectation that OPEC would raise prices,&quot; said Andrew Lebow, an energy analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York. &quot;This makes that much less probable.&quot;    Some analysts expect further price erosion. &quot;Prices will remain under pressure until it becomes clear what the final OPEC position will be,&quot; said Mr. Barakat.    That won't become apparent until the cartel meets, analysts said. In the meantime, the posturing between OPEC factions is sure to continue, oil specialists say.    &quot;Everyone's digging in and it looks to be one difficult, acrimonious meeting,&quot; said Rick Donovan, head of the international-energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices soared as already scant supplies continued to tighten. The December contract rose 3.90 cents a pound to end at 86.05 cents, after trading as high as 86.60 cents. The premium of December over the March contract, a major indicator of the tightness of nearby copper, rose 0.625 cent from Friday to 4.05 cents. One analyst noted that during the two-day drop after the stock-market crash, the December premium narrowed only slightly and now is double what it was before the crash, when copper was at 89 cents a pound. In the cash market, a dealer said the premium for immediate-delivery copper is ranging around six cents to 6.5 cents a pound and tending higher. Late last week, the premium was around five cents a pound. This is a result of tightening supplies and accelerating demand, analysts said. London Metal Exchange stocks Friday fell for the eighth consecutive week, dropping 12,500 metric tons to 68,225 tons, the lowest level in 13 years. New York Commodity Exchange stocks last week fell 9,492 tons, to 64,041 tons. World-wide deliveries of copper to consumers in the third quarter rose 8% from a year earlier, said one analyst, who added: &quot;We are now entering the period when consumption normally becomes strong and doesn't peak out until the second quarter of the following year.&quot;    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat-futures prices tumbled as traders reacted to news that starting Friday, the Agriculture Department will begin accepting weekly bids for up 10 million bushels of surplus wheat. Some analysts view the decision as an attempt to weaken wheat prices and make American grain more price competitive on world markets. Traders took the news and its promise of increased available supplies badly, as the Chicago Board of Trade's December wheat contract plunged 8 1/4 cents, closing at $2.88 1/4 a bushel. Corn and soybeans fell in tandem with the wheat market.    COTTON: Futures prices rose on a combination of adverse weather in some foreign producing countries and the end of selling pressure caused by sales of Pakistani cotton. December-delivery cotton advanced 1.59 cents a pound to 68.32 cents, ending just under the best level of the day. Pakistan, which had been a significant seller on the world market and a factor in depressing prices, withdrew from the market late last week, according to one analyst. &quot;Apparently Pakistan succeeded in completing a large deal and is no longer a seller,&quot; he said. Another analyst said some traders felt increased demand could develop for U.S. cotton as a result of the lower dollar and the possibility of reduced crops overseas. </TEXT></DOC>
