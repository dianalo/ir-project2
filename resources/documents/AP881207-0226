Gerard Becker, speaking for the four moderate unions, read astatement saying they accepted the offer and ``rejected the policyof all or nothing.''   The complex compromise proposal of the Paris Transit Authoritywould raise base pay for transit workers by $50 a month by Jan. 1,1990. It would also grant raises of 2.2 percent that were alreadyplanned for 1989.   The communist-led General Confederation of Labor, which rejectedthe offer, is demanding an immediate monthly increase of $170 forall employees. The group has asked workers on the national railroadto walk off the job next week to back its demands.   Three other smaller unions, who did not participate in thestrike, had accepted the management offer on Tuesday.   The strike began last month with its strongest support amongmaintenance workers. By last week, however, it had halted all trainson the suburban express network and disrupted subway and bus trafficthroughout the area.   Premier Michel Rocard's Socialist government called in severalhundred army trucks to help commuters travel to work.   Transit authorities said service was improving Wednesday as morestrikers returned to work. It was not immediately clear how manyworkers would heed the confederation's call to continue the strike.</TEXT></DOC>
