The article by Professor Roy Meadow, head of pediatrics and childhealth at St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, appeared in theBritish Medical Journal.   Meadow wrote that from 2 percent to 10 percent of the deathsattributed to sudden infant death syndrome ``have probably beensmothered by their mothers.''   ``Some mothers smother their child when they are feeling aviolent hatred toward their baby,'' he wrote. ``Others do it in arepetitive systematic way, taking their child regularly to thedoctor each time they have smothered their child for long enough tomake him or her unconscious.''   Dr. Pamela Davies, of the Foundation for the Study of InfantDeaths, said the organization had always recognized that some cribdeaths may have been caused by adults, but she thought a figure of10 percent was highly unlikely.   Meadow said many crib death victims have suffered recurrentepisodes of respiratory arrest or seizures that may have beeninvestigated, but doctors may not have considered the possibility ofchild abuse.   ``Asphyxia is an uncommon but serious form of child abuse,''Meadow wrote.   ``The commonest form is smothering, and the abuser is usually thechild's mother, who uses her hand, a pad of rolled-up clothing, or apillow to obstruct the child's air passages.   ``Less commonly she presses the child's face against her chest,encloses the child's head in a plastic bag, or strangles by pressureon the child's neck.''   He added: ``A young child who cannot breathe struggles and triesto get air. The smothering needs considerable force, even when achild is young. Despite the obvious violence entailed the signs maybe very few.''</TEXT></DOC>
