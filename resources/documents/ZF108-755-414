What happens is that one day thetelecommunications manager receives a phone call from someone who appears tobe selling a new PBX.andP;  Or perhaps the survey is from a &quot;market researchcompany?&quot; Or maybe the survey is from &quot;The Telephone Company.&quot; Somewhereduring the survey, the caller will ask what type of PBX the company has,which model, how big it is, etc.andP;  And with PBX instruction manuals freelyavailable and floating around the industry, the rest, as they say, ishistory.andM;There are solutions.andP;  The most obvious one is to change DISA passwordsfrequently.andP;  Or shut DISA down permanently.andP;  And turn the remote access porton only when your service company wants &quot;in.&quot; The remote maintenance personcalls up and asks that the remote access port be switched on for 20 minutes,etc.andP;  But that may not be possible.andP;  Another solution: Buy a smart' modemthat accepts an incoming call, checks the password out, then hangs up anddials the caller's modem back.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
