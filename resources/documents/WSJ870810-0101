SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Borland International Inc. will introduce today a spreadsheet program that can mimic and by some measures outperform financial modeling programs such as Lotus Development Corp.'s big-selling 1-2-3.    The Quattro program, as it's called, is scheduled to become available sometime in the fourth quarter.    For Lotus competitors, it is the first of several spreadsheets to be introduced this fall for International Business Machines Corp. and IBM-compatible personal computers. The new products include a feature that speeds recalculation of a spreadsheet when only a handful of the many individual figures in it are changed. Microsoft Corp. employs that ability in its popular Excel spreadsheet for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh and is expected to do the same when it introduces a version of Excel for IBM and compatible computers later this year. In contrast, Lotus 1-2-3 recalculates an entire spreadsheet when one number is changed, a slower process. Lotus has said it plans to offer 1-2-3 users a separate program that will solve the problem.    &quot;Basically, it's open season on Lotus,&quot; said Stewart Alsop, publisher of PC Letter, an industry newsletter. Mr. Alsop, who has seen Borland's new program in action, said that &quot;this is the first time that a major software company has taken on Lotus on its own terms -- namely speed.&quot;    Philippe Kahn, Borland's founder and chief executive officer, said Quattro has been under development for more than three years, and had been designed &quot;from the ground up,&quot; and not as a &quot;clone&quot; of 1-2-3. &quot;While Quattro looks to the user like 1-2-3, it is actually a different program internally that is twice as fast,&quot; he asserted in an interview. &quot;And it has superior graphics built in to the program, as well.&quot;    Borland hasn't yet set the price for Quattro, although Mr. Kahn, who is known for slashing software prices to build sales, says it will probably be less than $200. &quot;We've talked about prices from $99 to $725,&quot; he added. Lotus 1-2-3 lists for $495, but usually sells for about $325. Analysts have estimated that Lotus sells as many as 70,000 copies of 1-2-3 a month.    Quattro is the first of several business applications programs that Borland plans to introduce by the end of the year, including a word processor called Sprint. Previously, the company had concentrated mainly on supplying computer language programs used by professional programmers, or inexpensive &quot;desk accessories&quot; such as calculator or calendar programs.    Last month, Borland announced plans to acquire Ansa Software, a maker of sophisticated data-base manager programs, in a transaction valued at about $38 million. Ironically, as part of that merger, Ansa's Chairman Benjamin Rosen, the venture capitalist who helped engineer Lotus's early success and formerly sat on its board, agreed to join the Borland board.    Mr. Rosen said he wasn't aware of Borland's plans for Quattro at the time of the merger. He also said he doesn't believe Borland's new spreadsheet will dislodge Lotus 1-2-3 as the dominant spreadsheet. &quot;Maybe it will surprise me, though,&quot; he added.    Michael Kolowich, Lotus vice president for marketing and business development, said it wasn't appropriate to comment on Borland's product. But Jim P. Manzi, chairman and chief executive of the Cambridge, Mass.-based company, has said in the past that &quot;if there's a Rock of Gilbraltar in this marketplace, it's 1-2-3.&quot; Company officials have said corporate customers who have grown accustomed to 1-2-3 are unlikely to switch to another spreadsheet unless the new product is significantly better. In addition, Lotus itself is preparing improved versions of 1-2-3 for delivery next year that will include a faster recalculation feature.    Lotus also has sued Paperback Software International of Berkeley, Calif., and Mosaic Software Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., for copying the &quot;look and feel&quot; of 1-2-3. The cases haven't been resolved. </TEXT></DOC>
