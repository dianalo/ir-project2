The Request, accompaniedby supporting testimony and one library reference, accompanied by supportingtestimony and one library reference, stems from a Postal Service determinationthat there should be a change in the nature of postal services which willgenerally affect service on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basiswithin the meaning of 39 U.S.C. 3661(b).The Postal Service intends to change delivery standards for First-ClassMail. The Service is conducting a nationwide examination of delivery standardswith a view toward aligning these standards more closely with the needsof postal customers. Studies performed to date by the Postal Service indicate that, within certainlimits, consistency of First-Class Mail delivery is of greater importanceto the postal customer than speed of delivery. Furthermore, the geographicarea within which customers need overnight and two-day delivery is smallerthan the current areas receiving such delivery. Consistent with this marketanalysis, the Service proposes to issue guidelines to its divisions forthe purpose of evaluating and realigning First-Class delivery standards.The Service plans to begin implementation of the resulting adjustmentsto First-Class delivery standards on February 10, 1990.InterventionPersons desiring to participate as a party should file a notice of interventionwith the Secretary of the Commission or before October 23, 1989, in accordancewith section 20 of the rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.20).
