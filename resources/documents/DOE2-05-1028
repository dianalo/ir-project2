Under the situation, it is extremely important for Japan todevelop necessary technology as an energy security method. The SunshineProject is a research and development program in progress investigatingabundant, clean and new kinds of energies which include solar energy,geothermal energy, coal liquefaction and gasification, hydrogen energy,etc. The present state and prospect for each type of new energy differsdepending on the specific nature of the energy and the progress in therespective research and development activity. Research and developmentstates are introduced regarding to the solar energy; geothermal energy;coal, hydrogen, wind energy; and ocean energy. In view of the progressof the Sunshine Project, reduction of cost, acceleration for practicaluse energies to intermediate demands and requirements, internationaldevelopment are considered to be the vital problems left for the future.(4 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
