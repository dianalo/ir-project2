Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., was once thenation's most profitable thrift by virtue of its huge stakein junk bonds, many bought from Mr. Milken and his securitiesfirm, the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. ButColumbia reported huge losses yesterday from massivedeterioration in that junk bond portfolio over the last fivemonths, joining many other firms that have foundered aseither buyers or sellers of high-yield debt.</LP><TEXT>   Columbia said it had a loss of $379.1 million, or $19.17 ashare, in the fourth quarter. The losses reflect junkbond-related loss provisions and write-downs of about $470million in the quarter. Moreover, the company said it had aloss of nearly $200 million in the first two months of 1990because of further junk bond trouble. As of Feb. 28, Columbiasaid it had a $121 million shareholder deficit, compared withequity of $77.6 million three months earlier.   The worse-than-expected results leave troubled Columbiateetering on the edge of federal receivership. The $9.25billion-asset institution has been subject to federaloperating restrictions for several months as junk bond losseshave eroded its equity to the point that it violated certainnew federal regulations for minimum capital levels. Becauseof federal regulations covering insolvent institutions, thecompany will now be barred from making any new loan orinvestment without prior regulatory approval, a conditionthat regulators say makes it all but impossible to secure acapital infusion from outside investors.   If Columbia fails, the government would become thenation's largest holder of junk bonds with a total portfolio,including junk bonds from other thrift failures, with a facevalue well in excess of $8 billion, and indicated losses ofabout $2 billion. Regulators weren't available yesterday forcomment on Columbia.   Columbia officials declined to comment beyond a writtenstatement. Recently, the federal Office of Thrift Supervisionhas shown little mercy in handling other capital-shy thrifts'bids to avoid federal receivership. Edward G. Harshfield,Columbia's president and chief executive officer, said in thestatement: &quot;Our regulators have been working with us in avery constructive manner.&quot;   Federal regulators have already seized three of the thriftindustry's top five holders of junk bonds in recent months.The junk bond losses reflect a provision of the thriftbailout bill last August that requires Sandamp;Ls to carry junkbonds on their books at market prices. The rule's impact onthe industry generally has been limited because relativelyfew thrifts bought such bonds, but it has been devastatingfor those that did.   Columbia's results also augur possiblylarger-than-anticipated losses at other junk bond-investingthrifts. In December, Columbia indicated it would takefourth-quarter write-downs or losses on its junk bondportfolio of at least $320 million, compared with the $470million in losses or write-downs that it ended up actuallyincurring. Because of write-downs and other factors, thevalue of junk bonds and certain preferred stock on Columbia'sbooks sank to $3.38 billion as of Dec. 31 from $4.36 billionas of Sept. 30, a decline of 23%.   Columbia is pinning its hopes for avoiding federalreceivership on selling its junk bonds and concentrating onmaking mortgage loans and pursuing other traditional thriftactivities. But it is doubtful that regulators will approvethe plan because of the thrift's insolvency and bleakerprospects. Because of continuing upheaval in the junk bondmarket, for instance, Columbia said &quot;significant additionalloss reserves and other asset write-downs&quot; were expected forthe month of March.   Columbia has proposed that it divest itself of all itsjunk bonds over five years as a way of meeting newregulations that bar thrifts from holding such bonds.Yesterday, Columbia disclosed it had already sold $575million in junk bonds between last August and this pastFebruary.   As an alternative, the company has also proposed aone-time divestiture of the bonds as part of a &quot;structuredfinancing.&quot; It said First Boston Corp. had begun discussionswith interested parties but that the plan carried somedrawbacks.   In the year, Columbia had a loss of $591.1 million, or$30.11 a share, compared with profit of $65 million, or $1.49a share, in 1988. The 1989 results reflected write-downs andloss provisions totaling $870 million, most of which werejunk bond-related. At year's end, Columbia said it hadreserves for future junk bond losses of about $275 million,or enough to absorb a further 7.5% reduction in the value ofits portfolio.   Moreover, Columbia's fourth-quarter report showed that itis having trouble in some of its hoped-for core businesses.It reported a $43.7 million loss from real-estate operationscompared with a $22.3 million third-quarter loss and profitof $5 million in the year-earlier fourth quarter. Itsfourth-quarter net interest income slid 47% to $31.7 millionfrom $60.5 million, reflecting the higher cost of funds aswell as troubled assets.   Some analysts have questioned whether the company iscapable of successfully making the transition to being aconventional Sandamp;L, saying that it operates a relatively small29-office branch network and has traditionally gathered alarge chunk of its deposits through Wall Street moneybrokers.                                                                                                       </TEXT></DOC>
