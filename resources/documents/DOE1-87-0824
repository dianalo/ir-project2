The accelerator involves recirculationof an electron beam several times in independent transport lines, whichpass through common ferrite core accelerating sections. It is designedto produce effective accelerating gradients in the 100 MV/m range forcompactness and yet be amenable to long pulse trains at high currents.Reduced weight is obtained by utilizing the high frequency (10-30 MHz)branched magnetic switching of Birx to reset the induction cores duringthe recirculation period of the beam. An experimental and theoretic programis underway to investigate key physics issues regarding energy bandwidth,control of emittance growth, and electromagnetic instabilities. The progressof the Phase I program is discussed in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
