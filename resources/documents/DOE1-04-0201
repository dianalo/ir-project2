<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-04-0201 </DOCNO><TEXT>A brief review is presented of encoding circuits used in scintillationhodoscopes to reduce the number of photomultipliers and to speed up theanalysis of physical events. The characteristics of codes suitable forphotoencoded hodoscopes and methods of constructing such codes are discussed.Such codes can be constructed with the aid of analytic computation methods.Application of the analytic method makes it possible with the aid ofa digital computer to analyze the code parameters and to design encodingcircuits with specified properties. The parameters and design methodsof codes for detecting clusters and multiplicities of two and three arepresented.</TEXT></DOC>
