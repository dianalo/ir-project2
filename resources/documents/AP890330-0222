The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durablemanufactured goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $230.7 billionlast month after declining 1.2 percent in January.   It was the biggest decline since a 3.6 percent drop last Julyand was consistent with a variety of other government reports onthe economy's performance last month that have pointed downward.   In reports Wednesday, the Commerce Department said new homesales and the Index of Leading Economic Indicators both declined inFebruary.   The index, the government's chief economic forecasting gauge,fell 0.3 percent last month, the biggest drop since July when theindex slid 0.8 percent.   Meanwhile, sales of new, single-family homes slumped 9.4 percentin February to the lowest level in more than a year. Analysts saidfurther declines are expected as rising mortgage rates push morepeople out of the market.   Sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000after advancing 2.5 percent in January, when unusually mild weatherbrought out more buyers.   The reports had little effect on the nation's financial markets,which expected the declines.   Analysts said the declines were consistent with other recentsignals that the economy may be losing steam _ welcome news tothose who say growth must slow in order to keep inflation fromspiraling.   ``This should reduce concern about the economy overheating,while the decline is not sharp enough to give any signal of arecession,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for theNational Association of Manufacturers.   Others, however, are concerned that the economy will slow toomuch and that the Federal Reserve Board's yearlong campaign toraise interest rates and dampen inflationary pressures will stiflegrowth altogether.   ``The monetary tightening that we have experienced and somemonetary tightening that is probably still to come are going tocause a downturn,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynchandamp; Co. in New York.   Analysts blame the slow home sales pace on the pinch of highermortgage interest rates, which forced some lower-income buyers outof the market.   The leading index, designed to foretell economic activity six tonine months into the future, advanced 0.6 percent in December and0.7 percent in January after vacillating during much of 1988.   In February, eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leadingindex declined, with the biggest negative factor a drop inmanufacturer orders for new plants and equipment.   The other negative factors were a drop in building permits, adecline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, a contractionin the money supply, a dip in an index of consumer expectations, anincrease in initial claims for unemployment benefits, faster vendordeliveries to companies signaling slower demand, and a decline inmanufacturers' unfilled orders.   Two indicators made positive contributions: an increase inprices for raw materials indicating stronger demand, and risingstock prices. One indicator was unchanged last month: the length ofthe average work week.</TEXT></DOC>
