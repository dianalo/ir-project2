Getting Back in Black To Be ChallengeandM;MILPITAS, Calif.andP;  -- As System Industries (SI) faces its third straightquarter in the red and records what is probably the single largest quarterlyloss ever for a DEC third-party company, it is adding another restructuringto a history of change.andM;But this time, besides having to reverse its financial slide through newproduct development, SI will have to find substantial amounts of cash in thenext two years as balloon payments come due on two loans.andM;After posting a $500,000 loss in fiscal 1984, then an $11.2 million loss in1985, SI posted profits of $4 million, $5.2 million and $3.2 million in 1986,1987 and 1988.andM;That return to profitability was funded largely by money borrowed frominvestors and banks in 1985.andP;  The first payment on these loans, $5 million incash, is due investors in May 1990, according to Jessie Bean, SI's manager oftreasury operations.andM;And by March 30, 1991, a second payment of $10 million is due, Bean said.andO;The larger loan was a bank loan secured &quot;primarily to purchase ImperialTechnology.&quot;andM;Both loans have a convertible stock option, but making the loan payment incommon stock would be practical only if SI stock is selling at more than $7 ashare, Bean said.andP;  The stock closed Wednesday at $1.83.andM;The company's red ink in 1985 was caused by &quot;too rapid [an] expansion, and wealso had a product trade-in program that was kind of a disaster.andP;  We ended uphaving to write off $3 million,&quot; Bean said.andM;In 1986 the company made an effective turnaround by getting out of theHewlett-Packard and Data General markets, focusing on the DEC market, andputting in stringent cost controls, he said.andM;Bean blamed the current troubles on &quot;a combination of [difficult] marketconditions...SI was just focusing on too many different things and not doingthe kind of job it should have done on each one.&quot;andM;SI officials say their plan is to continue all product lines; research anddevelopment, however, will be slowed substantially.andP;  &quot;We're really going toshrink our operations in America,&quot; Bean said.andP;  European operations, whichhave been profitable, will not be affected, he said.andM;One Randamp;D project that will continue full-speed ahead, however, is SI's ongoingattempt to reverse-engineer DEC's BI chip, an SI spokesman said.andP;  &quot;The BIdevelopment project is continuing.andP;  We're planning to make a computer portadapter for the BI,&quot; he said.andM;SI, which had originally planned to begin shipping BI products in February1989, began reverse-engineering DEC's BI chip in March 1988.andM;The products that currently differentiate SI from other third-party vendorsare its Clustor subsystems.andM;Clustor 3, which began shipping in April 1988, provides shared storagebetween Q-bus and Unibus VAX systems.andM;Similar in concept to DEC's HSC controllers, the Clustor subsystems emulateDEC's older RM05 driver, rather than the MSCP protocol used widely in DEC'scurrent storage offerings, and allow multiple hosts to share one subsystem.andM;Shipping of Clusotr 5 began earlier this year, the spokesman said.andP;  Itincludes a Disk Cache Processor (DCP) for better subsystem access time.andP;  InFebruary, SI announced Clustor 1 and Clustor 2 subsystems targeted for theMicroVAX environment.andP;  Clustor 1 is a smaller version of Clustor 3, andClustor 2 adds the DCP to Clustor 1.andM;Third-Party CompetitionandM;SI has also been slugging it out in a commodity market with other third-partyvendors that compete with SI's C-Series disk drives for dEC's HSC clustercontrollers.andM;The C-Series, which DEC alleges infringes patents held by DEC, includes an844MB SI93 disk drive, as well as the 1.7GB SI95 announced in February andthe 863MB SI92 announced this month.andM;Also recently announced were 8mm helical-scan, IBM 3480-compatible,nine-track tape drives for HSC controllers.andM;&quot;We've been saying that [they] will be available imminently, and that isstill the case,&quot; the spokesman said.andM;This latest reversal is not the first time SI has traveled this path.andP;  &quot;Thecompany has had a history of going up and down--having several good years andthen a lean year,&quot; said Paul Emery III, who left as SI's chief financialofficer 15 months ago.andM;Emery, now a senior vice president at Santa Cruz Operations of Santa Cruz,Calif., joined SI in 1984, just after the company fell into the red for thefirst time after several years of profitability.andM;&quot;I believe the [Chief Executive Officer Robert] Duncan era ...andP;  hasconstantly driven for high value-added proprietary products that would demandhigher profit margins,&quot; Emery said.andP;  &quot;[SI has] a heavy engineering contentand a heavy marketing content but hasn't been able to deliver the productthat would generate those profits.andM;&quot;There's an old adage in business that says, 'Let revenue drive growth'; inthe last couple of years the [SI] infrastructure grew ahead of revenues--aneasy mistake to make during times of growth,&quot; Emery said.andM;&quot;They made some expansions that proved to be untimely, and we're seeing theresult of that,&quot; said James McArthur, manager of investor relatons at FirstMississippi, which acquired 9.7 percent of SI's stock when SI bought outImperial Technology in February.andP;  &quot;We expect to see the management make somechanges,&quot; he added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
