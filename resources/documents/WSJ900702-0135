Schmitt   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/02/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><LP>   In an episode of &quot;L.A. Law,&quot; attorney Michael Kuzak foundhimself in an ethical quandary for suppressing the fact thathis opposing counsel in a big case wasn't a lawyer. It tookjust a week for the California state bar to suspend him.   In reality, lawyer discipline hasn't been nearly thatswift or effective, but it is getting better. Under pressurefrom consumers, judges and even a few reform-minded lawyers,state bars from California to Florida have toughened theirdiscipline acts over the past two years.</LP><TEXT>   Consider: Last year, the California bar boosted itsdiscipline spending 75% to $33.4 million and added afull-time court devoted exclusively to discipline matters;Illinois has added some non-lawyers to its disciplineprocess, and opened to the public hearings that used to beclosed-door -- just in time to hear a case against thepresident of the Chicago Bar Association. In January, afederal judge invalidated a Florida bar rule that treatedlawyers like kings by threatening to jail consumers whovoiced complaints about attorneys in public. A month later,the state Supreme Court approved even broader changes.   New Jersey is already seeing benefits of tough newstandards for lawyers: Between 1984 and 1989, while thenumber of dues-paying attorneys in the state rose about 50%,the number of total complaints filed against them actuallydeclined.   New Jersey lawyers &quot;have the benefit of a rule that iscertain,&quot; says Raymond Trombadore, the chief of New Jersey'slawyer discipline agency. Adds James Fox Miller, president ofthe Florida Bar, &quot;Short of perfection, {the system} isgetting better and better.&quot;   But as the reprimands escalate, so do objections fromwithin the ranks of attorneys. Indeed, a growing number oflawyers accused of misconduct, along with their defenders,seem to think that the system is becoming increasingly riggedagainst them.   &quot;They're being jerks,&quot; says Arthur Margolis, a Los Angelesdefense lawyer and a former state-bar prosecutor, referringto California's state bar disciplinarians. Some attorneysargue that lawyers accused of misconduct are being deniedtheir constitutional rights, while others voice concern abouthow lawyers are turning in each other in what one calls a&quot;Hitler-youth type scenario.&quot; Still others saydisciplinarians lack sensitivity to lawyers with alcohol ordrug dependencies, which are behind as many as 40% of thecustomer complaints.   Of course, many people believe lawyers remain an overlyprotective order when it comes to disciplining themselves.Only a small fraction of complaints lodged against lawyersever result in formal discipline, and getting outrightdisbarred remains no easy task. Local bars generally continueto control the discipline process, and they admit that someof the biggest gripes about lawyers, such as theircompetence, remain outside the scope of such proceedings.   Mostly, discipline is meted out for the grossest forms ofmisconduct, such as stealing client funds. Nevertheless, morepeople than ever are filing complaints against lawyers. HALT,a Washington, D.C., legal reform group, estimates that 93,000complaints were filed against lawyers in 1988, compared withabout 70,000 in 1985.   Concern about inadequate funding for discipline hasprompted the American Bar Association to commission a hardlook at the subject. The last time the ABA did that, in 1970,the system was declared &quot;powerless, antiquated andscandalous.&quot; In February, when the latest commission held apublic hearing in Los Angeles, &quot;we got 200 people who wantedto tell us their horror stories,&quot; recalls Mr. Trombadore, theNew Jersey discipline chief and a member of the panel. &quot;Somepeople came 800 to 900 miles&quot; to complain.   &quot;I have totally lost confidence in the ability of thestate bar to discipline its members,&quot; gripes Barry Silberg, aSanta Rosa, Calif., plastic surgeon who says he filed acomplaint against his ex-wife's lawyer in a divorceproceeding, but saw it dismissed without explanation. &quot;Ithink the bar is essentially a marketing organization in thisstate,&quot; he adds.   Some California lawyers, though, think the reality is muchharsher. Last year, California's Supreme Court upheld a lawthat empowers the bar to temporarily suspend lawyers evenbefore their discipline cases have been finally adjudicated.Defense lawyers had complained that the law wasunconstitutional because it deprived the accused of dueprocess of law. The bar used the new authority to suspendabout 20 lawyers last year.   Mr. Margolis, the Los Angeles defense lawyer, complainsthat the bar is &quot;overreacting.&quot; This spring, one of hisclients, celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, admittedto seven ethical violations, including failing to promptlyreturn unearned fees to clients. His name, though, was tarredwith more serious charges that could have led to disbarment-- such as stealing from clients -- only to have the bar dropthose charges, according to Mr. Margolis. State bar officialssay they aren't finished with Mr. Mitchelson, however, andrecently filed new charges that he misappropriated clienttrust accounts. Of the new charges, Mr. Margolis asserts:&quot;They were drafted as poorly as the prior ones, and it isclear there has been an inadequate investigation.&quot;   Other California attorneys are alarmed at what theyconsider to be an unsympathetic view of lawyer misconductstemming from drug or alcohol abuse.   Lawyer David Demergian concedes that he had problems whenCalifornia's state bar court last year recommended that he bedisbarred for misappropriating $25,000 from client trustaccounts. According to court records, during a three-dayperiod in June 1985, &quot;he used three and one-half ounces ofcocaine, pointed a loaded gun at his fiance and a friend, andexpressed a desire to kill his former secretary.&quot; But Mr.Demergian, who admitted to a cocaine problem, soughtleniency, arguing that he had paid back the stolen funds,become active in rehab programs, and had 67 letters ofsupport from judges, attorneys and clergy. No dice. TheCalifornia Supreme Court upheld the disbarment order.   &quot;Do you kill him or give him a chance to rehabilitatehimself?&quot; asks Ted Cohen, a Los Angeles lawyer who defendslawyers in substance-abuse cases. &quot;They are just coming downtoo hard on these people.&quot;   A 1988 Illinois Supreme Court decision requiring lawyersto turn in each other for ethical lapses has also drawn majorfire. The case involved a lawyer who spent some settlementmoney he won for a client. The client hired a second attorneyto get the money back. That second lawyer was suspended for ayear for failing to notify the state bar after learning ofthe first lawyer's misappropriation.   &quot;Lawyers can be faulted for a lot of things, but theprofession has historically treated the attorney-clientrelationship in a very special way,&quot; says Warren Lupel, aChicago legal defense lawyer. &quot;This {rule} kind of breachesthat. It is creating a Hitler-youth type scenario.&quot; Mr. Lupelsays the case prompted more than 900 such lawyer vs. lawyercomplaints last year.   Illinois lawyers, he adds, are being asked by the statebar to respond to complaints about their phone demeanor orfor neglecting messages. &quot;If I notified a state agency inIllinois that a doctor was not returning my phone call, theywould laugh and hang up,&quot; Mr. Lupel says.   Nevertheless, states are plowing ahead with tough reforms.Last year, the number of lawyers punished by the Californiastate bar jumped 44%; a once-huge backlog of unresolvedcomplaints is rapidly being whittled down. New Jersey nowrandomly audits attorney finances and automatically disbarsattorneys who steal from their clients. Unlike most states,New Jersey also prohibits disbarred attorneys from seekingreinstatement.   Dominic Aprile, a Newark, N.J., defense lawyer, says thatthe changes have come at the expense of lawyers'constitutional rights. Lawyers facing discipline have more atstake than, say, a person charged with petty crimes, but havefar fewer legal protections, he believes.   Mr. Trombadore, the New Jersey discipline-agency chief,disagrees, saying: &quot;The deterrent effect outweighs theoccasional hardship that might be generated in a case thatcries out for mitigation.&quot;   ---                  More Lawyers, More Reprimands                                                                                                          As attorneys proliferate, so do the complaints andsanctions against them                                                                                                                                CALIFORNIA                                                                                                                                          1989          1984                                                                                                        Attorneys                      101,226        83,882 Complaints                      19,767         8,329 Total sanctions                    430           240                                                                                                                                  FLORIDA                                                                                                                                          1989          1984                                                                                                        Attorneys                       44,175        32,792 Complaints                       7,175         5,042 Total sanctions                    425           157                                                                                                                                  ILLINOIS                                                                                                                                          1989          1984                                                                                                        Attorneys                       54,866        45,171 Complaints                       5,822         2,721 Total sanctions                    141            45                                                                                                                                 NEW JERSEY                                                                                                                                          1989          1984                                                                                                        Attorneys                       30,549        20,471 Complaints                         842         1,079 Total sanctions                    114            69                                                                                                                                   NEW YORK*                                                                                                                                          1989          1984                                                                                                        Attorneys                       51,000        40,000 Complaints                       2,600         2,702 Total sanctions                    170           115                                                                                                                                     TEXAS                                                                                                                                          1989          1984                                                                                                        Attorneys                       53,407        41,264 Complaints                       7,470          N.A.
