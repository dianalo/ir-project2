<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-0135 </DOCNO><TEXT>A numerical technique for solving current- and thermal-diffusion problemsin railgun conductors has been used to study joule heating in rails thatare subject to multiple current pulses. Copper rails that are 25 mm highby 12.5 m wide with a 20-mm-square bore and a current pulse with 1-MApeak current and 1-ms pulse width at half maximum were assumed. Thiscombination of parameters is sufficient to accelerate an 80-g projectileto 2-3 km/s with each current pulse. Three parameters were varied inthe analysis: the repetition rate or current pulse frequency (3.3 to100 Hz), the coolant heat-transfer coefficient (5 x 10/sup 4/ and 5 x10/sup 5/ W/m/sup 2/ . K), and the coolant channel distribution in therail. Detailed results are used to illustrate the acceptability or unacceptabilityof particular combinations of these parameters for operation at steadystate.</TEXT></DOC>
