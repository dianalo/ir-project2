While denying rumors that Moscow police were preparing touse tear gas and armored personnel carriers to break uprallies, Soviet Deputy Interior Minister Pavel Bogdanov saidin a statement through the government news service Tass thathis troops would &quot;fulfill instructions by the cabinet.&quot; Thecabinet Monday banned all rallies, picketing anddemonstrations between yesterday and April 15.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to the demonstration for Mr. Yeltsin, the bancovers the initial period of widespread price increases theKremlin has scheduled for introduction Tuesday. In Moscow,the police department takeover follows several days ofindications that a political -- if not physical --confrontation was brewing between Soviet hardlineconservatives and the democratic movement in the Russianrepublic headed by Mr. Yeltsin. Conservative Communistsseveral weeks ago called a special session of the RussianParliament to consider ousting Mr. Yeltsin from office. Thesession is to start tomorrow, and this week some of thedeputies complained to Mr. Gorbachev that they were being&quot;subjected to organized and strict moral pressure&quot; where theylive and work.   Tass and government newspapers have also begun a torrentof propaganda against the democratic movement and Mr. Yeltsinreminiscent of the campaign that preceded the violentconfrontation between the Soviet army and demonstrators inLithuania in January. Tass, for example, said an &quot;atmosphereof hysteria and confrontation&quot; had developed around theRussian Congress meeting, and Pravda has described anatmosphere of &quot;terror&quot; for Communist Party members.   Mr. Yeltsin, a populist whose standing has improved as thecountry becomes more unhappy with Mr. Gorbachev, has openlycalled for the Soviet president's resignation. Mr. Yeltsincontends that Mr. Gorbachev is leading the country intodisaster and hasn't taken the right steps to fix its economicproblems.   The Russian republic headed by Mr. Yeltsin is thecountry's largest and richest. It has been trying to separateitself from the Kremlin by keeping more of its gold and oilrevenues. Yesterday, the republic's prime minister announcedan independent economic-reform program designed to introducea market economy in the shortest possible time by selling offstate assets, cutting taxes and relaxing rules on foreigninvestment. But it isn't clear if the republic can proceed onits own, in defiance of the Kremlin's economic program.   So far, Moscow city officials are defying orders to stoptomorrow's planned demonstration in support of Mr. Yeltsin.Mayor Gavriil Popoff said that despite the difficult timesthe capital is going through, he didn't think the situationwas so serious as to deprive citizens of the right todemonstrate. &quot;The impression is being created that a courseof confrontation has been chosen,&quot; he said. &quot;Recently a lothas been said about this, accusing democrats of choosing thisvery course. But in reality it is those who accuse us whohave actually chosen a confrontational course and are tryingto bring it to life.&quot;   Last year, when Mr. Gorbachev tried to take away the rightof Moscow officials to authorize rallies he was stopped byhis own constitutional watchdog committee, which declared hisaction unconstitutional.   Mr. Gorbachev's decision to put the Interior Ministrydirectly in charge of law enforcement in Moscow appears toconfirm Mr. Popoff's recent fears that the Kremlin wouldattempt a takeover of Mossoviet, the elected city council.Earlier this year, Soviet Interior Minister Boris Pugoremoved the police chief the city had chosen and reinstated aconservative Communist and former KGB officer. Mr. Gorbachevhas also called for a re-examination of the way the Sovietcapital is governed, and ordered the national Parliament totake up the issue in its current session.   Vadim Bakatin, a former interior minister who now serveson Mr. Gorbachev's security council, said &quot;decisive measureswould be taken&quot; to prevent tomorrow's demonstration. Paraderoutes will be blocked with buses and other equipment, hesaid.   The Interior Ministry is something like the U.S. NationalGuard, with greater powers than local police forces but lesspower than the Soviet army, which was responsible for theconfrontation in Lithuania.   There have been a number of demonstrations in support ofMr. Yeltsin recently in Moscow. The most recent drew a crowdestimated at 500,000 in the Manezhnaya Square near theKremlin.</TEXT></DOC>
