Type C leak rate testing of containment isolation values to allow one(1) or two (2) \3/4\-inch vent and drain lines to be open on those penetrationsthat would otherwise not be testable when this specification is applicable.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensees' application foramendment dated December 29, 1988.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed change to the TS is required in order to provide the licenseesflexibility to perform Type C local lead rate tests required by 10 CFRPart 50 Appendix J. which would otherwise not be able to be performed whenPrimary Containment Integrity-Shutdown must be maintained. Performanceof local leak rate testing activities when this specification is applicablehas the potential to reduce outage durations by increasing the time availableto perform this potential critical path testing acitvity and to permitadditional time for isolation valve repair and retesting, if required,subsequent to initial testing and surveillance.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision toTS and concludes that the calculated offsite doses, assuming a postulatedfuel handling accident while the two lines are open and using a 15-daydecay time (minimum time between start of the refueling outage and conductof Type C local lead rate testing) are well within the dose reference valuesof 10 CFR Part 100 and are within the acceptance criteria given in StandardReview Plan Section 15.7.4. Accordingly, the Commission concludes thatthis proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmentalimpact during the first refueling outage. Permanent TS changes using a24-hour decay time which would be applicable to subsequent outages, willbe the subject of future correspondence.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2246). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TS involves a change to surveillance and testing requirements, specificallywith regard to maintaining containment integrity while moving fuel. Itdoes not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission conluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operaion and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statements Related to Operation of Perry NuclearPower Plant, Units 1 and 2, dated August 1987. Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensees' request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated December 29, 1988, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,DC and at the Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of March 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy G.
