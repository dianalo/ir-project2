Each led to a touchdown.;    On the first play, Jim Kelly andThurman Thomas teamed for a 48-yard gain on a pass when Perry Williams of theGiants let Thomas get by him. On the second play, Kelly hit Andre Reed for a36-yard completion when Greg Jackson of the Giants missed a tackle.;    Thatdamage was typical of the havoc the Bills create when they run plays without ahuddle. The idea is to give the defense no time to substitute and to createuncertainty over which defender has which assignment.;    Giants Coach BillParcells has had his defense work against the no-huddle offense every day thisweek. But he said the no-huddle should not be overrated.;    &quot;The no-huddle isnot the problem,&quot; Parcells said. &quot;The problem is Jim Kelly and Andre Reed andThurman Thomas and James Lofton, the guys who run that offense. We're familiarwith it. But I'm not saying it's not going to be a problem.;    &quot;I think it'sjust a two-minute offense. It can be a little unsettling. But the no-huddleisn't going to win the game. The athletes running it are what wins games.&quot;;   In the past, the Cincinnati Bengals had success with the no-huddle offense.Then the Bills adapted it and have had success in a different way.;    &quot;It canbe intimidating,&quot; said Giants cornerback Everson Walls. &quot;The Bills' no-huddleis really different from Cincinnati's, because the Bills call the plays at theline of scrimmage.;    &quot;They are a lot quicker with it, and that puts a lot ofpressure on the defense. You have to recognize the players and theirformations at the same time and adapt your defense from that in a splitsecond.&quot;;    Bill Belichick, the Giants' defensive coordinator, said theno-huddle offense puts stress on defensive communications.;    &quot;You don't havetime to recognize some things,&quot; he said. &quot;It also puts a creative limit on thethings the offense can try to do, but their offense is not complex anyway.&quot;;   The Giants' defense hopes to play its game and not let the Bills dictate howit will play.;    &quot;They've taken away the aggressiveness from some defenses,&quot;inside linebacker Gary Reasons said. &quot;You can't let that happen to you. If weunderstand the tempo of the game, we can match up pretty well.&quot;;    Outsidelinebacker Carl Banks said, &quot;You have to have the defensive signals calledquickly. You have to get the defensive linemen down. Once they stand uplooking for a call, it's all over.&quot;;    Nose tackle Erik Howard said,&quot;Adjustment is a big thing. You hope you know their tendencies. You have to beable to adjust to the players they have in the game.&quot;;    Recognition andadjustment aside, the major weapon for the defense is communication. Insidelinebacker Pepper Johnson told how the four linebackers (from left to right:Banks, Reasons, Johnson and Lawrence Taylor) had to know what each one wasdoing.;    &quot;The guys on the left side have to communicate what they see to theguys on the right side,&quot; Johnson said.;    &quot;If you see something, you tellLawrence or Carl. Lawrence can't raise up and tell Carl. So he tells me, Itell Gary, and he tells Carl.&quot;;    The urgency of communication extends to allparts of the defense.;    &quot;It's who's on the field, where they line up and whocovers whom,&quot; said backup safety Dave Duerson. &quot;Communications is the key, andbecause Everson Walls and I are new to the Giants this year, it has forced thesecondary to communicate a lot. So we can handle this.&quot;;    Johnie Cooks, abackup linebacker, said oral messages and hand signals were fine, but not theultimate defense.;    &quot;The no-huddle is more of a problem if you let it beone,&quot; he said. &quot;It's only a problem if you fret over it instead of gettinginto position.&quot;;    Still, everyone seems to agree that it all comes down tothe players involved. Parcells said that, and when his words were relayed toTed Marchibroda, the Bills' offensive coordinator agreed.;    &quot;Yes,&quot;Marchibroda said, &quot;and the Giants have the defensive players to stop it.&quot;;Giants' log (15-3); Sept. 9       Philadephia      27-20; Sept. 16      atDallas        28-7; Sept. 23      Miami            20-3; Sept. 30      Dallas          31-17; Oct. 14       at Washington    24-20; Oct. 21       Phoenix         20-19; Oct. 28       Washington       21-10; Nov. 5        atIndianapolis  24-7; Nov. 11       at L.A.
