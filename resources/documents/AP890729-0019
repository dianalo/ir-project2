Raanan Gissin said of Friday's raid byhelicopter-borne commandos.   Seized by the commandos were cleric Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, hiscousin Ahmed Obeid and a friend, Majid Fahs, a Lebanese policespokesman told reporters.   Gissin said Obeid and two ``assistants'' were ``safely inIsraeli hands and undergoing questioning.''   One person was killed in the assault on an apartment building inthe village of Jibchit, 20 miles north of the Israeli border and 35miles south of Beirut, according to Lebanese and Israeli reports.   Lebanese police said a neighbor, Hussein Abu Zeid, opened thedoor of his apartment during the raid and was shot to death by thecommandos. Israel radio said Zeid was one of Obeid's bodyguards.   Even before Friday's abductions, some Israeli officials said thecapture of a Lebanese Shiite leader supported by Iran couldinfluence the release of three Israeli servicemen kidnapped insouthern Lebanon in 1986.   Lebanese security sources suggested Obeid may have been abductedin a plan to exchange him for U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.Higgins or other foreign hostages. The sources also have linkedObeid with Higgins' abduction.   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., was kidnapped in southern LebanonFeb. 17, 1988, while serving with an observer group attached to theU.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon.   Seventeen foreign hostages are held in Lebanon, including nineAmericans and three Britons but not counting the Israeliservicemen. It is belived most of the hostages are captives ofpro-Iranian terrorist groups affiliated with Hezbollah, or Party ofGod.   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, has been held the longest. He was kidnapped March16, 1985, and a Shiite Moslem group, Islamic Holy War, has said itis holding him.   Gissin called Obeid the ``equivalent of the commander of the(Hezbollah) terrorist organization in South Lebanon.''   Obeid, 33, has denied involvment with the fundamenalist Islamicgroup but Israel and the U.S. State Department have called him amember of Hezbollah.   Britain's Foreign Office deplored the kidnapping, saying itcould jeopardize the lives of the foreign hostages and called forhis release.   Gissin disagreed and said Hezbollah leaders will ``now thinktwice before harming their hostages.''   ``They value the lives of their leaders far more then they valuethe lives of their suicide fighters,'' he added.   Gissen said Hezbollah guerrillas have attempted at least 20cross-border raids into Israel this year.   An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters, ``Israelsaid many times in the past that when the fight against terrorismis at stake, it reserves the right to respond whenever it finds itsuitable and effective.''   The three Israeli troopers believed held hostage in Lebanon aresoldiers Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, captured Feb. 17, 1986,when guerrillas ambushed their patrol, and air force navigator RonArad seized Oct. 16, 1986, when his plane was shot down.   Lebanese police, the Israeli news media and witnesses gave theseaccounts of the Jibchit raid:   Three helicopters took part in the operation. About 12 commandoswith silencer-equipped pistols surrounded Obeid's building andforced their way into his apartment.   Israeli television said the troopers blasted the front door ofObeid's apartment with plastic explosives, seized Obeid and theother men and rushed them to a helicopter that departed in theattack that lasted less then 30 minutes.   Obeid's wife, Mona, was locked in a room with her hands tied andher mouth taped shut.   Iran's Foreign Ministry issued a statment saying, ``Thisshameless act by the Zionist regime will not remain unanswered bythe Moslem and combatant forces.''</TEXT></DOC>
