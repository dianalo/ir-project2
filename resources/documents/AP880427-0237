Earlier Wednesday, the separatists released one policeman whofelt ill, officials said.   Assistant Prosecutor Jean Bianconi was seied at about 9 a.m. onthe island of Ouvea, part of the Loyalty Islands 110 miles north ofNoumea, the capital on the main island of this French SouthwestPacific territory.   Also captured were Capt. Philippe Legorjus, head of the elitegendarmes special intervention force, five of his men and aMelanesian policeman.   Last Friday, separatists attacked the police station in theOuvea village of Fayaoue, killing four officers and capturing 27.Twelve of those hostages have been released. Besides the onereleased Wednesday, 11 were freed Monday.   The captives, who now number 23, were being held Wednesday in acave on the north side of Ouvea.   The kidnappers demanded that officials annul local electionsthat took place Sunday, send an envoy from Paris to discussautonomy, and withdraw police reinforcements from Ouvea.   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up about 43 percent ofNew Caledonia's 145,000 inhabitants. An estimated 80 percent ofthem favor independence. The rest of the population is made up ofEuropean settlers, Polynesians and Asians, most of whom want toremain French.   Bernard Pons, French minister for overseas territories who wentto New Caledonia to direct operations, said the cave wasinaccessible because it was in a cliff near the sea with heavyvegetation around it.   Pons said authorities located the cave Tuesday. He saidBianconi, who claimed to have good relations with the separatists,proposed himself as an intermediary and went to the hideout with apolice escort.   Pons said that after Bianconi established verbal contact withthe kidnappers, he moved toward the cave with the gendarmes and allwere surrounded and taken captive.   In an interview published Wednesday in the Paris newspaperFrance-Soir, Pons said the government was considering officiallydissolving the main separatist group, the Kanak Socialist NationalLiberation Front (FLNKS), and making membership in it illegal.   ``Until now, there has been no reason for taking such a step,''Pons said. ``The FLNKS could be considered a component of thepolitical life of the territory, but current events lead me tore-examine the question.''   Leopold Joredie, secretary-general of the Union Caledonienne,the main component of the Front, told The Associated Press bytelephone, ``The only way to suppress the (independence) demands ofthe Kanaks is to eliminate us all.''   In Paris the Constitutional Council, France's highest legalbody, ruled that Sunday's first-round presidential election resultsfrom three of the 139 polling stations in New Caledonia wereinvalid.   President Francois Mitterrand had asked that all presidentialelection results from New Caledonia be annulled because thesituation there forced some polling stations to close.   The council ruled, however, that ``overall'' the crisis did notaffect the voting process.</TEXT></DOC>
