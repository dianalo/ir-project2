While U.S. officials still believe efforts to release morehostages are moving ahead, they doubt a final solution willbe found soon. One particularly sensitive hang-up is thehostage-holders' demand that two comrades imprisoned inGermany be released. Neither the U.S. nor Germany wants themout.</LP><TEXT>   The status of seven missing Israeli soldiers also getsmurkier. If Lebanese extremists provide hard informationabout the fate of the soldiers, that &quot;might break the logjam&quot;and get a full release of all captives moving, one U.S.official says.   But a full release may hinge on whether the Syrian andLebanese armies can extend their control over Lebanon and pryout the hostage holders.                                                                                                          REGULATORY LAXNESS in the Treasury-auction scandal stirscalls for reform.   The failure to spot illegal Salomon Brothers bids at asmany as five sales of Treasury notes riles lawmakers.Massachusetts Rep. Markey, who plans hearings, weighslegislation that would place restrictions on the auctionprocess for the first time. Some Fed officials urge allowingeasier access by hundreds of bidders rather than just 40&quot;primary dealers.&quot;   Treasury draws most of the fire for meek monitoring. &quot;Thehonor system is probably not an adequate system of policing,&quot;says SEC Chairman Breeden. But the Treasury resists majorchanges. &quot;The problem is with people who use the process tocorner the market,&quot; insists one agency official.                                                                                                          INTERNAL REPORTS on BCCI raise questions about somegovernment officials.   A November 1990 report by BCCI's lawyers and investigatorsmay cause more problems for embattled acting U.S. attorneyDexter Lehtinen in Tampa, Fla. The report alleges that thebank's offices in Miami and Boca Raton constituted &quot;a bankwithin a bank.&quot; It says that between 1982 and 1986 BCCI thereaided Jordanian businessman Munther Bilbeisi and others in &quot;a{coffee} smuggling operation.&quot;   Lehtinen, whom a Senate panel has twice refused toconfirm, recently indicted the Jordanian trader for taxfraud. But the internal evidence stirs questions about why heallowed the statute of limitations to expire on severalpossible smuggling charges against BCCI and Bilbeisi, who hasdenied any wrongdoing.   Another memorandum says former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young,for whom BCCI paid some travel expenses, provided &quot;patronageand help&quot; for BCCI's &quot;endeavors in Central America.&quot;                                                                                                          ANGRY ETHNICS: White House speechwriter Tony Snow andSoviet-watcher Ed Hewett meet with Ukrainian-Americans tocalm their outcries that Bush's remarks on his Soviet tripundercut Soviet republics' independence efforts. Aides sayBush was misinterpreted. &quot;There are a lot of angryUkrainian-Americans out there,&quot; says one of their spokesmen,George Nesterczuk.                                                                                                          INDUSTRY FREEBIES flowed at the National Conference ofState Legislatures meeting in Orlando. Philip Morris chippedin $30,000 for one party. Liquor trade groups gave freebooze. Dismissing criticism of the largess, Maine HouseSpeaker John Martin argued that at most &quot;four or five&quot;legislators &quot;might be influenced by it.&quot;                                                                                                          COFFEE MUGS and golf shirts for the Resolution Trust Corp.to give away have added $3,098.33 to the huge taxpayers' tabfor bailing out Sandamp;Ls, investigators for Rep. Annunzio ofIllinois find. Explains an RTC spokesman: &quot;When someone buysmillions of dollars of assets, we're happy to give him an RTCmug or even a golf shirt.&quot;                                                                                                          HOME STRETCH? Treasury chief Brady's top aide on banking,undersecretary Robert Glauber, moves his family back toBrookline, Mass., in apparent anticipation of his departure.Glauber, a Harvard Business School professor, vowed to stayuntil Congress passed a banking bill, which Treasury nowexpects by year-end.                                                                                                          A NEW CLASH on civil rights legislation shapes up in theSenate.   GOP Sen. Danforth, unable to forge a compromise with theWhite House, will likely join with Democratic Sen. Kennedy topress for passage this fall. Supporters contend the billwould win enough Senate votes to override a likely Bush veto.Some moderate Republicans' backing of Supreme Court nomineeThomas might mollify conservatives enough to let them safelyvote for a rights bill.   But Sen. Helms may try to attach a killer amendmentbanning non-quota racial preferences. And prospects in theHouse, where a bill passed by a non-veto-proof majority, willlikely dim as elections near. The White House insists acompromise is still possible, but a political battle withDemocrats is more probable.   &quot;They're playing with fire if they force us into a vetofight and elevate it on the {political} agenda next year,&quot;warns GOP strategist Charles Black.
