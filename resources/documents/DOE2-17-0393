The C-C stretching vibrations of rhodopsin,isorhodopsin, and bathorhodopsin have been assigned, as well as thoseof the 11-cis and 9-cis retinal protonated Schiff base model compounds.The insensitivity of the C{sub 14}-C{sub 15} stretch frequency to N-deuterationin all three pigments demonstrates that each contains a trans C=N bond.Comparison of the fingerprint modes of the visual pigments and theirmodel compounds shows that the C{sub 10}-C{sub 11} and C{sub 14}-C{sub15} single bonds are s-trans in all three pigments. This provides evidenceagainst the model of bathorhodopsin proposed by Lui and Asato, whichsuggests a C{sub 10}-C{sub 11} s-cis structure. The extreme similarityof the C-C stretch modes of rhodopsin and the 11-cis retinal protonatedSchiff base argues against the presence of a negatively charged proteinresidue near C{sub 13}, proposed to be responsible for the opsin shiftof rhodopsin. However, the unusually large shift of the C=N stretch frequencyupon N-deuteration in rhodopsin relative to the model compound suggeststhat the opsin shift mechanism may involve altered Schiff base - counterion interactions.</TEXT></DOC>
