But Albert Shanker, president of the 700,000-member AmericanFederation of Teachers, stopped short of endorsing the project,which is called Channel One and is scheduled to debut in March 1990.   ``We are encouraged by the fact that Whittle Communications hastaken such extensive steps to address the problems associated withits pilot project,'' he said in a statement.   ``There are still problems, however _ commercial advertising isstill on and it is very questionable whether a fast-paced programcan truly help students to think more critically and thoughtfullyabout news events, skills students desperately need,'' he said.   Shanker was one of several national educational leaders that havecriticized the Channel One plan for giving advertisers an avenue forpitching products to students in the classroom.   Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle announced Thursday it planned tolaunch Channel One in 1,000 schools across the country next March.The program was tested in six schools earlier this year.   Schools will be asked to sign a contract that will give themabout $40,000 or more worth of color televisions, satellite dishesand videocassette recorders in exchange for showing a daily12-minute news show that includes two minutes of paid advertisingduring the school day.   In the test, participating schools were required to show theprogram in every classroom so the entire student body sees it eachday.   Whittle said schools participating next spring would not berequired to show it to every student and could designate whichclassrooms will be wired to receive the program.   Kate Krell, a spokesman for Shanker, said the union also likedWhittle's plan to include smaller schools among those eligible toparticipate.</TEXT></DOC>
