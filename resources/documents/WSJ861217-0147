Senators and representatives alone would go from $77,400 to $135,000. The natural urge is to scoff at any such idea. We sympathize with that instinct, but we also recognize that many public officials do in fact deserve raises. The challenge here is obvious: If the public is going to pay its officials more money, how does it make sure that it gets its money's worth?    The Quadrennial Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries wants to get the salaries of the top 3,000 employees back up to where they were, in real terms, in the late 1960s. There have been only cost-of-living increases since 1977. As a result, declines in earnings since 1969 range from about 30% for a district judge to more than 50% for a cabinet secretary. Paying for the raises would cost $150 million a year.    It's hard to say what pay government officials &quot;deserve.&quot;    The judges may be the most deserving of pay increases. Their jobs are supposed to be for life, so they don't benefit from the revolving door. The current $81,110 salary for federal district judges would go to $130,000. President Reagan has been appointing many younger men and women to the bench, which creates the special problem of raising a family on the current federal judicial salary. One judge with teen-age children resigned, complaining of &quot;maltuition.&quot; A total of 39 judges have resigned since 1970, three-quarters of them for financial reasons. Lawyer and former federal official Michael Horowitz has said that &quot;pretty soon the judge will be the guy looking to impress the lawyer to get a cushy partnership.&quot;    Public compensation needn't achieve parity with the private sector, but the industry experts needed for agencies such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission aren't all lifelong Jeffersonian citizen-servants. Moreover, some executive officials can look forward to earning more over their lifetimes because their government service makes them more valuable in the private sector.    Congressional pay, on the other hand, poses a different set of problems. Men and women now spend millions on political campaigns for jobs that pay $77,400. What does the electorate get in return? Does it really want -- as it is now getting -- endless hearings run by huge staffs cramming more laws, rules and amendments into an already fat federal code?    In the private sector, most people associate big raises with work -- real, productive work. We can think of only one way to achieve a return on any raises given to congressmen and high officials: Cut their staffs.    The size of the mandarin class has grown exponentially, especially on Capitol Hill. We doubt that the security of the Republic would suffer if congressmen had fewer staffers whispering into both ears. Congressmen could do their own work instead of wheeling and dealing for honorariums to supplement their salaries. An added bonus would be that if legislators had to do more of their own work, a different sort of person might seek office.    The courts could do a much better job of creating sensible and predictable law if judges had to make do with less help. It is an open secret that most judges have responded to the litigation crisis in federal courts by letting their clerks write their opinions. It's nice for the brightest law students to become de facto judges upon graduation, but this is probably not the best way to do justice. Judges could get by with fewer clerks if they agreed to hear fewer cases. Liability generally could do with some narrowing.    Anyone wondering how federal salaries could have fallen so far behind need look no further than Capitol Hill. Congressmen have routinely insisted on linking their pay to executive and judicial pay. But in recent years, congressmen have refused to vote themselves pay increases, fearing what would happen to their prospects for reelection if they gave themselves raises. Executive officials and judges have suffered being on the end of the congressional tail that didn't wag.    This year, Congress passed the buck to the president by cleverly turning the legislative process upside down: President Reagan's request for pay hikes will become law unless both houses pass a joint resolution against it. By doing nothing, congressmen would give themselves a $57,600 raise. Let's pay them more. But let's also cut their staffs and make them earn their money. </TEXT></DOC>
