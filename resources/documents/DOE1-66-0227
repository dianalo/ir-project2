<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0227 </DOCNO><TEXT>Data from a group of three MOD-2 wind turbines and two meteorologicaltowers at Goodnoe Hills were analyzed to evaluate turbine power outputand wake effects (losses in power production due to operation of upwindturbines), and atmospheric factors influencing them. The influences ofvariations in the ambient wind speed, wind direction, and turbulenceintensity were the primary factors evaluated. Meteorological and turbinedata collected at the Goodnoe Hills site from April 1 to October 17,1985, were examined to select the data sets for these analyses. Winddata from the two meteorological towers were evaluated to estimate theeffect of a wake from an upwind turbine on the wind flow measured atthe downwind tower. Maximum velocity deficits were about 25% and 12%at downwind distances of 5.8 and 8.3 rotor diameters (D), respectively.However, the maximum deficits at 5.8 D were about 14{degree} off thecenterline orientation between the turbine and the tower, indicatingsignificant wake curvature. Velocity deficits were found to depend onthe ambient wind speed, ranging from 27% at lower speeds (15 to 25 mph)to 20% at higher speeds (30 to 35 mph). Turbulence intensity increasesdramatically in the wake by factors of about 2.3 and 1.5 over ambientconditions at 5.8 D and 8.3 D, respectively. An analysis of the ambient(non-wake) power production for all three turbines showed that the MOD-2power output depends, not only on wind speed, but also on the turbulenceintensity. At wind speeds below rated, there was a dramatic differencein turbine power output between low and high turbulence intensities forthe same wind speed. One of the turbines had vortex generators on theblades. This turbine produced from 10% to 13% more power than the othertwo turbines when speeds were from 24 to 31 mph. 11 refs., 21 figs.,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
