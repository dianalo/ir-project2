Christine Stevens now denies our conversation, in which she stated how much my research work on coronary artery bypass had meant to her husband and in which I replied that the operation would not have been possible without our preceding animal research. But Dr. John Sherman of the Association of American Medical Colleges, who heard the exchange, remembers the incident well. So does Gayle McNutt, a Baylor College of Medicine associate, who was standing nearby.    Whether or not Rep. Robert Mrazek intended his legislation to suggest &quot;that critical laboratory research into the medical mysteries of our time should stop,&quot; that has been the effect of previous legislation imposing similar restrictions, prohibitions, encumbrances and impediments on animal research; his legislation will result in yet another turn of the screw. Contrary to Mr. Mrazek's statement, the inability to use pound or shelter animals assuredly would drive costs up, since the cost of a pound animal is $5 to $55 as opposed to $275 to $600 for a purpose-bred animal, and he has made no provision in his bill for the increased costs. Mr. Mrazek calls his bill &quot;a compromise,&quot; the term used previously to pass similar legislation, but already such restrictions have shut down some important research in Massachusetts, so we need not therefore speculate about the result.    Since Andrew Rowan was not present during my conversation with Mrs. Stevens, he should not be speculating on whether it was &quot;highly unlikely,&quot; especially when two reliable witnesses have attested to it. Mr. Rowan displays more rashness than prudence or reason when he &quot;also imagines&quot; that I was not &quot;acting in accord with the normal standards of behavior expected of NAS panel members.&quot; Such ill-conceived statements are hardly worthy of comment, but having served on national and international professional bodies for years, I hardly need his gratuitous advice about proper behavior.    John Kullberg cited selective data that support his contention about shelter animals, but other studies have shown that many owners who abandon pets to shelters do not object to their use in research.    As a physician, I took an oath -- and received a license -- to do everything I could to relieve the suffering of patients. If the self-appointed guardians of animal rights are permitted to continue their stranglehold on medical research, we shall watch helplessly as families, friends, fellow citizens -- and animals -- fall victim to diseases whose prevention or cure we were not allowed to achieve. Witnessing such agony and misery would wrench the hearts of the most ardent animal lover.    Michael E. De Bakey, M.D.   Houston</TEXT></DOC>
