Results are as follows. 1. Seed germination was retardedby temperature increase and the germination rates at temperature +6{sup0}C (min. water temperature 18{sup 0}C) reduced. 2. Survival rate oftransplants at temperature +3{sup 0}C in summer experiment (max. watertemperature 29{sup 0}C) and +9{sup 0}C in winter (min. temperature 21{sup0}C) experiment were significantly lower than control. All of shootsdied at temperature +6{sup 0}C in summer experiments. 3. The change ofvegetative shoots to flowering shoots was inhibited by a temperaturerise of +3{sup 0}C (min. water temperature 15{sup 0}C). From these results,we inferred that the life cycle of Zostera in Odawa Bay will be affectedwhen temperature increases by +3{sup 0}C or greater both in summer andwinter.
