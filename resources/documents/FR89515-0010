Background</ITAG>The States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b),have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program thatis equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federalhazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter``HSWA'') allow States to revise their programs to become substantiallyequivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated underHSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization''for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g),and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federalor State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certainother changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitatedby changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260-266 and 124 and 270.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Colorado</ITAG>Colorado initially received final authorization on November 2, 1984. Coloradoreceived authorization for revisions to its program on November 7, 1986.On September 30, 1988, Colorado submitted a program revision applicationfor additional program approvals. Today, Colorado is seeking approval ofits program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). Specific provisionswhich are included in the Colorado program authorization revision madetoday are listed in Table 1 below.EPA has reviewed the Colorado application, and has made an immediate finaldecision that the Colorado hazardous waste program revision satisfies allrequirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional modificationsto the Colorado hazardous waste program. The public may submit writtencomments on EPA's immediate final decision up until June 14, 1989. Copiesof the Colorado application for program revision are available for inspectionand copying at the locations indicated in the ``<T2>ADDRESSES</T2>'' section of this notice.Approval of the Colorado hazardous waste program revision shall becomeeffective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State'srevision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the commentperiod. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either (1) awithdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing aresponse to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decisiontakes effect or reverses the decision.The State of Colorado submitted an initial draft application for the revisionof its authorized hazardous waste program on October 1, 1987. A seconddraft application for additional revision was received on January 15, 1988.The second draft application contained all information and revision requeststhat were a part of the October 1, 1987, application. The EPA comments,and the response by the State to the EPA comments, address both draft applications.EPA review of the draft application raised several areas of concern. Furtherexplanation and detail were requested on the intended program for administrationof the expansion of Colorado's hazardous waste program and on the organizationand utilization of the State's staff.On September 30, 1988, Colorado submitted a final application which furtherexplained how Colorado will expand the program to provide for the increasedresponsibilities. Several additional concerns on the details of the finalapplication were discussed between EPA and Colorado. A Letter of Intentwhich further clarifies the final application was agreed upon and madea part of the application.Colorado's application for authority to revise the Colorado hazardous wasteprogram has been found to be consistent and equivalent to the Federal hazardouswaste program. No significant aspect of this application provides for theColorado program to be broader in scope than is the Federal program.Facilities possessing permits issued under the Federal program for treatment,storage, or disposal are deemed by the Colorado Department of Health tohave a permit under Colorado Revised Statute 25-15-303(3). EPA issued underthat part of the RCRA program for which Colorado is being authorized today,become State permits upon Authorization. When the State either incorporatesthe terms of the Federal permit in State RCRA permits or issues State RCRApermits to those facilities, EPA will terminate those permits pursuantto 40 CFR Part 270 and rely on the State to enforce those terms and conditionssubject to the terms of an acceptable State/EPA Enforcement Agreement.Colorado has not requested hazardous waste program authority on Indianlands. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all hazardous wasteauthority under RCRA which applies to Indian lands in Colorado.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1_</T4><T4>Provisions Covered by this Program Authorization Revision</T4><H1>HSWA or FR Reference</H1><H1>State Equivalent*</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1.

Decision</ITAG>I conclude that the Colorado application for program revision meets allof the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly,Colorado is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous wasteprogram as revised in the September 30, 1988, application in lieu of thefederal hazardous waste program. Colorado now has responsibility for premittingtreatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and forcarrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitationof its September 30, 1988 revised program application and previously approvedauthorities. Colorado also has primary enforcement responsibilities, althoughEPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRAand to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance with Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisauthorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicabilityof certain Federal regulations in favor of Colorado's program, therebyeliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste inthe State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule,therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibilitry analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 Part 271</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential business information,Hazardous materials transportation, Hazardous waste, Indian lands, Intergovernmentalrelations, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water pollutioncontrol, Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>This notice is issued under the authority of sections2002(a), 3006 and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended 42U.S.C. 6912(a), 6926, 6974(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James J.
