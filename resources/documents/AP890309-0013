As an interim step in President Bush's plan for the savings andloan crisis, the FDIC _ a bank regulator _ is taking control of morethan 200 insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   ``I am deeply concerned about the ability of the FDIC to handleits current workload and to also take on the additional burdenassigned by the Bush plan,'' Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairmanof the House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions, saidWednesday.   ``We should not blindly transfer a whole burden ofresponsibilities to an agency that clearly has problems of itsown,'' he said, citing reports that seven banks in Texas had notbeen examined for the past four years.   However, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said, ``We believe weare up to the task.''   Seidman said the FDIC is diverting about 500 bank examiners fromits force of 2,029 to work on Sandamp;Ls. He conceded the agency would bestrained for two to three months, but said only 200 to 250 FDICexaminers would be needed after the initial takeovers.   In the meantime, the FDIC's list of problem banks has beendeclining, he said, and the agency will hire about another 150examiners by the end of the year. It also is raising salaries toretain experienced employees, he said.   White House budget director Richard Darman has agreed to testifybefore Annunzio's subcommittee later this month. Initially, Darmanhad refused, saying he would testify only before the full bankingcommittee.   However, he reversed his position after Annunzio sent a letter toPresident Bush complaining that Darman's ``ego problems'' threatenedto delay congressional action on the Sandamp;L crisis.   At another hearing, before the Senate Banking Committee,commercial bank groups endorsed the Bush plan, which would maintainseparate deposit insurance funds for banks and Sandamp;Ls.   Executives of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions saidearlier this week that the funds should be merged as a way offorcing banks to help pay for the Sandamp;L crisis.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House BankingCommittee, told reporters he opposes any plan to mingle the Sandamp;L andbank insurance funds.   ``I believe one drowning man is enough,'' he said.   Gonzalez said time pressures mean Congress likely will pass theadministration's off-budget borrowing plan for resolving the crisis,even though he personally favors direct Treasury spending.   He also said he favors giving Sandamp;Ls that concentrate on homemortgage lending a break in meeting stricter capital standards.   In related action, Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., introduced abill Wednesday to repeal tax breaks benefiting buyers of failedbanks and Sandamp;Ls. He said tax rules may be encouraging the new ownersto operate the institutions less efficiently. Seidman has asked thatthe tax benefits continue beyond their scheduled expiration at theend of this year.</TEXT></DOC>
