<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-1117 </DOCNO><TEXT>A comparison of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of Rhmetal and the intermetallic compounds RhTi and Rh{sub 3}Ti and the XANESof several Rh/TiO{sub 2} catalysts suggests that the same kind of Rh-Tibonding that occurs in the intermetallic compounds also develops in thecatalysts after they have been reduced at temperatures higher than about623 K. The results are interpreted as evidence for net electron transferfrom reduced TiO{sub 2} to at least some of the RH in the supported samples.</TEXT></DOC>
