He is self-contained, measured and, above all, managerial. He could be some successful entrepreneur from the pages of Fortune magazine. The very words he emphasizes -- &quot;invest,&quot; &quot;partnerships,&quot; &quot;competitive&quot; -- are more appropriate to an executive suite than to this valley of the hulks: mile after mile of abandoned steel mills along the Monongahela River, dark and lifeless beneath the greening trees.    This is liberalism with a new face and a gray business suit. It isn't Hubert Humphrey, proposing Washington solutions almost before he could find problems to solve. Nor is it Jimmy Carter, mistrusting Washington and running against it. Instead, many Democrats -- not just Mr. Dukakis, but other candidates and thinkers at all levels of the party -- are seeking ways to use the tool of government in new and cheaper ways.    Liberal activists, after more than seven years in the Reagan wilderness, sense an opening in a changing public attitude. &quot;The idea that government is bad is being replaced by the idea that government is needed,&quot; asserts Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer of New York.    &quot;There's room to run,&quot; agrees Harold Meyerson, a liberal Los Angeles political consultant. He is encouraged by swelling poll support for more spending on education, health insurance and job creation. But he worries that these sentiments collide with the Himalayan range of Ronald Reagan deficits.    The welfare state may return, he says in a recent essay, &quot;only by virtue of being contracted out.&quot;    Contracting out is exactly what many Democrats have in mind. What is evolving is a kind of leveraged liberalism. Washington would still set goals and standards, the crucial rules of the game. But those rules would often be patterned after successful experiments in the states -- particularly state innovations in industrial redevelopment. States and the private sector would be given far more latitude in executing policy. And corporate America would pick up much of the tab.    Even conservatives like Stuart Butler, the director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, acknowledge that such ideas are &quot;shrewd politics,&quot; given the temper of the times. But he argues that they amount to no better policy than do more traditional Democratic nostrums.    Liberal economic proposals, he contends, &quot;are basically the same stuff we heard in 1982 and 1983: Manipulating the economy to reward certain groups in the name of competitiveness.&quot; And shifting social-service costs to corporations, while politically attractive in the short run, could ultimately lead to higher prices or wage hold-downs that would hurt lower- and middle-income workers.    Democrats know that they are peddling their new ideas to a skeptical public. &quot;There's a lot of cynicism out there,&quot; acknowledges Rep. Robert Matsui, Democrat of California. &quot;People say, 'You guys get elected by spending money, so how are you going to do all this without spending more of it?'&quot; The answer is that these ideas would cost money. But not always a lot, and not always Washington's money.    Thus, Congress is contemplating forcing corporations to provide a hefty minimum level of employee health benefits; Gov. Dukakis just signed a similar Massachusetts bill last week. Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson would tap public pension funds for investments in research and development. And Mr. Dukakis proposes a $500 million-a-year Fund to Rebuild America -- an amount, he always points out, that's only one-seventh of this year's spending on President Reagan's Star Wars plan.    &quot;What I'm talking about is a set of partnerships with a limited number of critical industries,&quot; Mr. Dukakis explains. &quot;I think western Pennsylvania would be a natural for this kind of thing.&quot;    Critics don't find anything in Mr. Dukakis's Massachusetts record that convinces them that such a plan would work. Despite a gain in total jobs created, the state has been losing manufacturing jobs rapidly -- they were down to roughly 597,000 in 1987 from 673,000 in 1984. &quot;I'm not sure anybody can honestly say why it's happened,&quot; says George Kariotis, Mr. Dukakis's 1986 GOP opponent. &quot;What I can say is that Mike Dukakis doesn't have the answer. He doesn't know how industrial jobs are created or why they leave.&quot;    The notion of a &quot;partnership&quot; with business comes straight out of the quest for a &quot;national industrial policy&quot; -- 1984 campaign buzzwords that haven't been heard much this year. The term is controversial, partly because financier Felix Rohatyn used it earlier this decade to propose reviving the Depression-era Reconstruction Finance Corp. -- a symbol in some eyes of the kind of big-spending programs that have fallen from favor. Daniel Oliver, the Reagan-appointed Federal Trade Commission chairman, calls industrial policy just &quot;another manifestation of the statist impulse,&quot; the antithesis of the free-market Reagan philosophy.    To avoid the term, Democrats have seized on another: &quot;competitiveness.&quot; Besides his $500 million-a-year rebuilding fund, Gov. Dukakis says he would support temporary protectionism to give battered industries time to retool and retrain. And while Mr. Dukakis sometimes sounds like a professor giving chalk talks, Mr. Jackson brings his own brand of fire to the subject.    &quot;Those of you who own a VCR, raise your hands,&quot; Mr. Jackson suddenly demands of listeners. Hands shoot up all over. &quot;All right. How many of you personally own an MX missile?&quot; he continues. No hands go up. &quot;That's why we have a trade deficit!&quot; he shouts. &quot;The Japanese are making things they can sell; we're making things we can't sell.&quot;    More ideas are percolating up from academia. For example, Robert Reich, the Harvard public-policy expert, would move some research and development from the Pentagon to a new agency, a kind of National Science Foundation for industry. He would also relax antitrust laws to encourage mergers within beleaguered industries.    Economist Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology favors more government-industry efforts like Sematech, the huge consortium designed to save the U.S. semiconductor industry. In fact, he thinks such combinations are inevitable.    &quot;Ronald Reagan gave us Sematech,&quot; he says. &quot;And if Ronald Reagan can have an industrial policy, anybody can. Countries simply can't let their big industries go down the tubes.&quot;    A Democratic president would also almost certainly use aggressively the federal government's enormous potential power to, as Mr. Reich puts it, &quot;alter the rules of the game&quot; for states and businesses. One way is by stepping up the use of regulation as a way of shaping corporate decisions: Thus Mr. Jackson proposes a federal &quot;merger review board&quot; with power to delay or block mergers deemed harmful. Another is through the use of what Alden Raine, Gov. Dukakis's director of economic development, calls &quot;catalytic government.&quot;    For instance, more than 30 states now have &quot;incubator programs&quot; to help hatch new businesses. Michigan, under Democratic Gov. James Blanchard, has already tapped state public pension funds for its own venture-capital fund; a second program, the Michigan Strategic Fund, offers subsidies and incentives to private capital investing in riskier enterprises. Rather than create vast new agencies in Washington, a liberal president might be more likely to redirect federal money and assistance into such existing state and regional operations.    Many of the ideas being tossed around by liberals have a minimal direct cost to the federal government. But some key items on the agenda will unavoidably cost federal dollars -- something consistent with neither the current budget nor the political climate. No one likes taxes or favors &quot;turning over their money to politicians who do what they want with it,&quot; acknowledges Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the third-ranking House Democrat.    To get around that fact of life, some liberals are experimenting with the idea of directed revenues -- new taxes that would be specifically earmarked for some politically popular purpose.    A nationwide poll conducted last year by Peter D. Hart Research Associates for Kidspac, a children's-advocacy group, showed significant support for higher taxes -- but only when linked to such mom-and-apple-pie purposes as financing childhood health and education programs, reducing the cost of health care for the elderly and helping farmers.    Not surprisingly, liberal lawmakers have taken the cue. Thus, the House is considering paying for a new long-term health-care program for the elderly by making all income subject to the federal Medicare tax; a welfare-overhaul proposal would supposedly be partly paid for by better federal debt-collection efforts; a small fee on all imports would pay for retraining laid-off workers. The measure with the best chance of passage is catastrophic-illness insurance for the elderly, which would be paid for by an extra tax on the Medicare recipients who would get the benefit.    Many critics, however, dismiss such financing systems as gimmickry. They point out that none of these funding sources would really be earmarked; the money raised would go into the general pool of revenue. More important, such plans do nothing to address the problem of the federal deficit. Unlike, say, catastrophic-illness insurance -- which offers a tangible benefit to its recipients -- deficit reduction offers only indirect benefits in return for huge expenditures.    Beyond the obstacle of the deficit, observes Mr. Meyerson, the political consultant, liberals face an even more fundamental problem: In an international economy, even the simplest liberal initiative -- like increasing the minimum wage -- is vulnerable to arguments that it would hurt U.S. competitiveness. &quot;The economy has done an end run on liberals,&quot; he says.    And conservative political commentator Patrick Buchanan doubts the underlying premise of many liberal ideas -- that there is a genuine public clamor for expanded federal government. What Democrats take as a call for activism, he maintains, is actually only the pleading of &quot;certain special interest groups that are really driving for expansion of the federal government . . . especially for child care and long-term care for the elderly.&quot;    The problem for Republicans, he says, is that they haven't developed enough new initiatives to compete with retooled liberalism. &quot;In the absence of a Republican conservative agenda, somebody's agenda is going to be on the table and be debated,&quot; Mr. Buchanan says. &quot;And that agenda could be the Democrats'.&quot;    Some observers think that even George Bush, if he is elected, might seize some of the agenda.    &quot;You can see Bush circling the periphery,&quot; says political analyst Kevin Phillips. &quot;If Mike Dukakis can take economic steroids, so can George Bush.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
