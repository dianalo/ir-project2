The regiments were located at six garrisons around the country,the official news agency ADN reported.   It said 600 T-54 and T-55 tanks would either be destroyed orconverted for civilian use. It did not say what the civilian useswould be or how many tanks were deactivated Tuesday.   ADN also did not report how many soldiers were involved, butsaid 400 were in one of the regiments.   East Germany announced in January it would reduce its armedforces by 10,000 soldiers, 600 tanks and 50 fighter aircraft.   Some tanks were dismantling last summer and several hundredsoldiers were transferred to reserve units, the agency reported.   Col. Gen. Horst Stechbarth said transferred soldiers would``have a new task in the army or in the civilian economy.''   Maj. Gen. Manfred Jonischkies, the tank division's commander,said its anti-aircraft and anti-tank capabilities would beincreased. He said the changes were being made under ``the terms ofa Warsaw Pact treaty that calls for strategic changes that lead toa more defensive posture.''</TEXT></DOC>
