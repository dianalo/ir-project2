(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nancy Cruzan's parents again areseeking satisfaction from the legal system that has blocked theirthree-year battle to let the comatose woman die.   Joe and Joyce Cruzan say they have new evidence that their33-year-old daughter wouldn't want to continue living in hercondition.   Nancy Cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since aJanuary 1983 car crash, and is kept alive at a state hospital by asurgically implanted feeding tube.   Three witnesses have come forth ``who had specific discussionswith Nancy Cruzan regarding her wishes about life-sustainingmedical treatment,'' attorney Bill Colby, who represents theparents and their daughter, said in a petition filed Thursday withCharles Teel, a Jasper County probate judge.   No date for a hearing was immediately set, Colby said.   In July, in its first ruling in a ``right-to-die'' case, theU.S. Supreme Court barred the removal of the life-sustaining tube.It said a state's interest in preserving life may overcome thewishes of family members seeking to end the life of a patient in anirreversible, coma-like condition.   ``I feel this is a wrong that has to be righted,'' Joe Cruzansaid in an interview from his home in Carterville in southwestMissouri. ``We don't feel this is right for every family, but wefeel we're doing what Nancy would want.''   ``I don't know where it's going to end,'' he said. ``I hopewe're successful. I gave up being enthusiastic a long time ago,when I learned the legal system doesn't work very fast.''   In Thursday's petition, Colby said the Supreme Court ruled ``thediscovery of new evidence regarding the patient's intent'' couldallow for modification or reversal of the ban on removing herfeeding tube.   The petition said the court ruled that Missouri can require``clear and convincing'' evidence as a legal standard of proof ofMs. Cruzan's wishes before medical treatment is terminated.   Colby declined in an interview to disclose the identities of thethree people, other than to say two were people Ms. Cruzan hadworked for and the third was a co-worker. The conversations tookplace about three years before the car crash, he said.   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, who handled thestate's challenges to the Cruzan family, had no immediate commenton the filing, said his spokeswoman, Mary Jenkins.   Cruzan said of his legal battles: ``I feel frustrated, and somedegree of anger, but primarily frustration at the system.''   The 55-year-old sheetmetal worker said he considered taking hisdaughter to a state that might allow termination of artificialfeeding, but rejected the idea because ``I thought it was wrong.''   The Cruzans visit their daughter weekly at the MissouriRehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon.   Ms. Cruzan's body is rigid with her hands and feet bent intoclaw shapes. She can breathe on her own, and at times her eyes areopen and move randomly.</TEXT></DOC>
