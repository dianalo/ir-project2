(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   John Young is looking for love but hemust be going to all the wrong places, at least when he takes hiscar.   Two months after he put a bumper sticker on his car trunkadvertising ``wife wanted'' along with his phone number, no one hasgiven the single Minnesota native a jingle.   ``I've had no takers. Absolutely none. Not even a crank call,''said the 45-year-old convenience store manager who is divorced.   ``I think it's being taken lightly, like a joke, rather than aserious attempt at making contact,'' Young said Monday.   ``I'm pretty much of a homebody. If you're a mid-40s homebody,alone, what do you do?'' he said.   Bars aren't his scene, he said. He'd rather read, fish or listento music.   ``I spent 14 years in the infantry, 2{ years in Vietnam, and Ilike things that are peaceful,'' he said, seated on the couch ofthe Largo mobile home he shares with a black feline named Mama Cat.   Young, who describes himself as intelligent, sensitive andcurious, said his ideal woman would be intelligent and pretty.``And from there on, it's just a matter of chemistry.''   What does he offer?   ``I care,'' he said. ``And I'm absolutely serious about it.''</TEXT></DOC>
