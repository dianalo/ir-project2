Vena cavography has been indispensableimaging modality for the definitive diagnosis of this anomaly. Recently,however, CT scan in addition to excretory urography (IVP) and retrogradepyelography(RP) has been utilized in many reported cases in the diagnosisof retrocaval ureter. We have experienced 3 cases of retrocaval ureterconsecutively. In this paper we report these 3 cases of retrocaval ureter,in which CT scan enabled us to confirm the definitive diagnosis. We alsoreport another case of pelviureteric stenosis that was taken for retrocavalureter by CT scan. Causes of the misdiagnosis is discussed. In conclusionCT scan is useful diagnostic modality in the diagnosis of retrocavalureter and this lesser invasive technique might lessen the need for venacavography.</TEXT></DOC>
