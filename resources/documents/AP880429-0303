The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 3-16 point, or about $1.87 per$1,000 in face value, while its yield was unchanged at 9.10 percent.   Riggs National Bank of Washington raised its prime lending ratefrom 8.5 to 8.75 percent. Analysts said the increase came as noreal surprise, given the recent rise of open-market money ratesthat help determine banks' cost of funds, and no large money-centerbanks moved to match it.   But the move was enough to jostle the bond market, which beganto speculate that the Federal Reserve Board would tighten credit,thereby sending interest rates higher. When interest rates rise,bonds lose value.   However, the credit markets didn't stay down for long.   ``There was speculation that money has been moving out ofequities and into bonds,'' said Sun Wong Sohn, chief economist withthe Minneapolis bank holding company Norwest Corp.   Bond prices rallied sharply, but then settled back as the rumorsdied. Analysts said there was little conviction in the market.   ``The bond market is likely to mark time until more economicstatistics come out,'' said Marshall B. Front, an economist at theChicago investment and mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe andamp;Farnham.   Traders were looking in particular toward the Labor Department'sreport on April unemployment, due out on Friday.   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-termgovernments ranged 1-32 point higher to 1-32 point lower,intermediate maturities were unchanged to 3-32 point lower and20-year issues were off 1-16 point, according to the financialinformation service Telerate Inc.   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in theprice of a bond with a $1,000 face value.   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures pricemovements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of ayear or longer, rose 0.13 to 110.23. The Shearson Lehman DailyTreasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 0.36to 1,151.80.   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measuresprice movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five yearsor longer, fell 0.21 to 278.14.   Tax-exempt municipal bonds were down 1-16 point.   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 5.99percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Six-month bills rose 1 basis point to 6.35 percent and one-yearbills were up 2 basis pointsto 6.67 percent.   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans betweenbanks, fell to 7 percent from 7 1-16 percent late Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
