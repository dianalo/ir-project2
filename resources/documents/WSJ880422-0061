Tandy's new technology -- if it's all the company says it is -- is sure to delight consumers and enrage the recording industry. In about 18 months, Tandy said, compact disk players will hit the market that will make indestructible and near perfect recordings that millions of consumers can readily afford. While digital audio tape recorders -- the only real competition for a compact disk recorder -- cost $1,000 and up, Tandy's product will sell for only $500.    Nonetheless, there's no assurance that Tandy's compact disk recorders will reach consumers before a raft of competitors. Looking over its shoulder, Tandy is scrambling to get its technology into the market by licensing it to other makers.    With so much at stake, the battle the recording industry has been waging to prevent digital audio tape recorders from reaching U.S. shores will probably look like a skirmish compared with the fight that is almost certain to erupt over compact disk recorders. Some say the new technology would change the recording industry in the same way modern stereo equipment replaced the Victrola. If the Fort Worth, Texas, consumer electronics concern succeeds, its technology almost certainly will render existing cassette players and other recorders obsolete.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Tandy shares climbed $2.625 to $45.75.    &quot;It would certainly be a dynamite product,&quot; said Louise Boundas, editor in chief of Stereo Review. &quot;And I would expect tremendous opposition from the recording industry, which is unalterably opposed to consumers being able to record on these new machines.&quot;    Fearing that high-quality home copying will deeply bite into its profits, the recording industry has been heavily lobbying the federal government to prevent digital audio tape recorders from being sold in the U.S. The industry doesn't object to the sale of digital audio tape players, which don't make recordings. Industry groups have threatened to sue any company that tries to sell digital audio tape recorders, arguing that they would be used to record copyrighted material.    Makers world-wide have been racing to develop compact disk recorders. Many big Japanese stereo makers, including names like Sanyo and Sony, have been working for years to develop something akin to Tandy's new technology. Like Tandy's, those machines are about two years away, analysts say. Compact disk recorders that store computer data, rather than sound, are expected out this year.    Of particular significance to Tandy's announcement is the price. The idea of a $500 machine that makes recordings like a sophisticated studio is something few in the industry would have thought possible only a year ago. &quot;Nobody has thought you could make audio compact disk recorders in this price range,&quot; said Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    The company certainly has high hopes that the technology -- which it has dubbed CD Thor -- will be one of its biggest money-makers ever. John V. Roach, Tandy's chairman, told a throng of reporters, analysts and music industry officials, at New York's Hotel Pierre that &quot;someday&quot; the technology could produce &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; in profits for Tandy. At least, he asserted, it means &quot;tens of millions.&quot;    The normally low-key and bashful Mr. Roach clearly was swept up in the euphoria surrounding the announcement. Asked what was the biggest challenge facing Tandy engineers in developing the technology, Mr. Roach replied, &quot;Probably convincing me they weren't on marijuana or something.&quot;    Despite all the hoopla, however, even Tandy acknowledged that some technological questions remain. Mr. Roach conceded, for instance, that Tandy isn't sure whether disks recorded on its system would deteriorate with many playings; That's a key point because the longevity of prerecorded compact disks is one of their most attractive features.    Compact disk recorders are expected to be popular with consumers also because they would make recordings without the background hiss and wear-and-tear typical of normal cassette recorders. Digital audio tape also wouldn't have the background noise, but the tapes are more fragile than a compact disk, which looks like a small plate made of hard plastic.    Mr. Roach said he believes that record companies won't battle compact disk recorders as they have battled digital audio tape because compact disk recordings, unlike digital tape recordings, have been in the market for a few years. &quot;How do you stop a train that's coming down the tracks?&quot; he said.    But Ms. Boundas of Stereo Review said &quot;record companies are selling a lot of compact disks and that's where they are getting a lot of their profits.&quot;    Officials of the Recording Industry Association of America, the group leading the opposition to digital tape recorders, couldn't be reached for comment.    Separately, as expected, Tandy unveiled a personal computer, the Tandy 5000, compatible with IBM's Personal System/2 line. The Tandy model, which is comparable to IBM's PS/2 model 80, is priced at $6,499 with a 40 megabyte hard disk drive. Analysts said that price is only slightly below the discounted price offered by retailers on IBM's machine. However, while Tandy's Radio Shack stores don't regularly offer discounts to individual buyers, Tandy has a direct sales force that offers discounts to corporate buyers.    ---   Michael W.
