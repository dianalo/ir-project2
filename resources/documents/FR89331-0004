This amendment requires inspection of additional areas ofthe control columns for cracks, and rework or replacement, as necessary.This amendment is prompted by reports of additional cracking in areas outsideof those required to be inspected by the existing AD. Such cracking, ifnot detected and corrected, could lead to failure of the control columnwhich, if it occurred during a critical flight regime, could result inloss of control of the airplane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information may be obtainedfrom McDonnell Douglas Corporation, 3855 Lakewood Boulevard, Long Beach,California 90846, Attention: Director of Publications, C1-L00 (54-60).This information may be examined at FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 17900Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington, or 3229 E.

Hsu, AerospaceEngineer, Airframe Branch, ANM-122L, FAA Northwest Mountain Region, LosAngeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 E. Spring Street, Long Beach,California 90806-2425; telephone (213) 988-5323.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A proposal to amend Part 39 of theFederal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 73-07-09, Amendment 39-1967(39 FR 33791; September 20, 1974), applicable to all McDonnell DouglasModel DC-8 series airplanes equipped with control columns, P/N 5614272-1and/or -2, to require inspections of specific areas of the control columnsfor cracks, and rework or replacement, as necessary, was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 17, 1988 (53 FR 46465).Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the commentsreceived.Three commenters requested that the proposed rule be revised to increasethe repetitive inspection interval from 2,500 hours time-in-service to3,800 landings. To justify this request, the commenters noted that AD 87-13-04,Amendment 39-5656 (52 FR 23946; June 26, 1987), was issued in responseto failure of the same part number control columns on McDonnell DouglasModel DC-9 series airplanes, and that the AD requires similar inspectionsas those proposed for the Model DC-8 airplanes, but at intervals of 3,800landings. The commenters suggested that it would follow that the inspectionintervals for both airplane types should be the same. The FAA does notconcur. Due to the signficiant differences in the design and load spectrumbetween the Model DC-8 and DC-9 airplanes, the FAA has determined thatrepetitive inspections at intervals of 2,500 hours for the Model DC-8 isthe maximum permitted without compromising safety. One commenter requested the repetitive inspection interval be extended,since, based on this commenter's current airplane utilization rate of 2.5flight hours per landing, this would result in an inspection every 1,000landings. Further, this commenter noted that, since the control columnis normally not used in cruise when the autopilot is engaged by the crew,the inspections should be based on landings instead of flight hours. Ina similar request, another commenter suggested that the repetitive intervalbe increased to 3,000 flight hours to correspond with its scheduled maintenance(``C-check''). The FAA does not concur with these requests. Based on thedesign of the control column, the loads it experiences under average flightconditions which contribute to fatigue cracking, and the unsafe conditionpresented by a cracked control column, the FAA has determined that therepetitive inspection intervals, as proposed, are the maximum allowablein order to maintain an acceptable level of safety and to detect crackingin a timely manner.One commenter requested that the proposed rule be revised to clearly statethat, if inspection of the area noted in McDonnell Douglas All OperatorsLetter (AOL) 8-632 is accomplished in accordance with paragraph B. of theproposed AD, this action terminates the inspection requirements of paragraphA. of the proposed AD; and furthermore, for the noted area, allowable limitsand blendout criteria established in accordance with paragraph A. of thisAD still apply. The FAA concurs, and the proposal has been revised to clarifythis.One commenter requested that the installation of control column part numbers5614272-501 and -502, currently specified as terminating action in AD 73-07-09,be retained and be clearly stated in the body of the proposed amendment.The FAA agrees. Paragraph C. of the proposal has been revised to make thisclarification.Since issuance of the proposal, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision1 to McDonnell Douglas DC-8 Service Bulletin 27-267, and Revision 2 toMcDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A27-267. Together, the above revisionsprovide description of two new part number control columns, P/N's 5614272-503and -504, that can be installed to replace control columns, P/N's 5614272-1and -2, as terminating action for the inspection requirements of this AD.The final rule has been revised to incorporate references to these laterrevisions and the additional control columns that can be installed as terminatingaction.After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule as proposed, with the changes previously described.The FAA has determined that these changes do not increase the economicburden on any operator, nor do they expand the scope of the AD.There are approximately 350 Model DC-8 series airplanes in the worldwidefleet. It is estimated that 256 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affectedby this AD, that it will take approximately 14 manhours per airplane toaccomplish the required actions, and that the average labor cost will be$40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the ADon U.S. operators is estimated to be $143,360.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities, becauseof the minimal cost of compliance per airplane ($560). A final evaluationhas been prepared for this regulation and has been placed in the docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
