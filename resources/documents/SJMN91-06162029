You wouldthink they would ask us to. You would think that Olive View would get on thestick.&quot;;    Attorneys for the hospital and a nursing service also named in thelawsuit say they have proof that the baby who died was not Chavez's --including medical charts that show the baby was healthy and slight differencesin the physical descriptions and names on the birth and death certificates.;   O'Hagan said a key piece of evidence is the coroner's report that the deadbaby had only one kidney. He said an ultrasound performed on Chavez before thebaby's birth showed the fetus had two kidneys.;    &quot;Where did the other kidneygo?&quot; asked O'Hagan, who represents Medical Specialists Temporary PersonnelInc., a nursing service whose employees were on duty at the hospital.;    Ifthe baby wasn't switched, &quot;How else could this child suddenly lose a kidney,&quot;O'Hagan asked.;    But an attorney for Chavez said the ultrasound images didnot prove the unborn child had two kidneys, and disputed the defendants' claimof other &quot;evidence&quot; of a switch.;    &quot;You can't see two kidneys on there. Youcan't see three, four, five or any,&quot; said Aileen Norvell Goldstein, whorepresents Chavez.;    Goldstein said that surgery could have corrected thebaby's condition if it had been diagnosed at the hospital.;    &quot;If the babyhad been diagnosed properly he would have led a normal life,&quot; she said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Daily News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  LOS ANGELES  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910610  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  511  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday June 10, 199100162029,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
