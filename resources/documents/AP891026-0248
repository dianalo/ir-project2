The Commerce Department said the increase in the gross nationalproduct, the broadest measure of economic health, matched a 2.5percent rise in the April-June quarter. Third-quarter growth wasaided primarily by a boom in consumer spending that resulted fromheavy car sales.   Inflation showed a marked improvement in the third quarter, witha price index tied to the GNP climbing at an annual rate of just2.9 percent, down significantly from a 4.9 percent annual advancein the first half of the year.   Michael Darby, commerce undersecretary for economic affairs,said the moderate economic growth and lower inflation offerencouraging signs that the nation's record peacetime expansion willextend into the next decade.   The lower inflation rate is ``creating appropriate conditionsfor stronger non-inflationary growth as the decade of the 1990sunfolds,'' Darby said.   Through the first nine months of 1989, the economy has grown atan annual rate of 2.9 percent, exactly on target with the Bushadministration's forecast for the whole year.   But many analysts are predicting that growth will slumpdramatically in the final three months of this year in the absenceof the auto sales boom that spurred consumer spending from Julythrough September.   Many economists predict the country will flirt with a possiblerecession over the next 12 months because of expected weakness insuch areas as trade and business investment.   Signs of deterioration were evident in the third quarter as theU.S. trade deficit, as measured by the GNP, surged by $22.9billion. It was the worst trade figure since the second quarter of1983.   Trade had been one of the economy's brightest spots as a boom inexport sales had spurred a rebound in U.S. manufacturing. However,economists have warned for some time that hefty increases in thevalue of the dollar threatened to derail the trade improvement bymaking American goods more expensive on overseas markets.   In the third quarter, imports shot up at an annual rate of 15.1percent while exports did not grow at all, the poorest showing forexports since early 1986.   The economy was also held back in the third quarter by a $4billion loss in personal incomes attributed to the devastation fromHurricane Hugo, which hit the Southeast in September.   The estimate of income loss was attributed to uninsured lossesand loss of rental income by property owners.   The stock market reacted negatively to the GNP report, with theDow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropping 36.07 points by1 p.m. EDT.   In another economic report today, the Labor Department saidprivate-sector labor contracts negotiated through collectivebargaining from January through September provided average annualwage increases of 3.1 percent. First-year pay hikes in those pactsaveraged 3.7 percent.   On Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called onCongress to make additional reforms in the way financial marketsare regulated, saying the Securities and Exchange Commission shouldbe empowered to halt trading in times of emergencies.   The SEC's chairman, Richard C. Breeden, has said he does notwant such authority.   In his first testimony to Congress since the Oct. 13 marketslide, Brady said the finaicial turmoil had not altered his beliefin the souncness of the U.S. economy, but did point up the need forchanges in market regulation.   Some economists are predicting that growth in the economy duringthe final three months of the year could slip to an annual rate of1.5 percent or less.   While such an anemic pace increases the risk of a recession,many analysts are counting on the Federal Reserve to ride to therescue by lowering interest rates in order to spur activity in homebuilding and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.   At the same time, many economists expect unemployment to riseduring the next 12 months before growth rebounds by the end of 1990.   ``We are not going to have a recession, but we will have a verysignificant slowdown in the economy,'' said David Wyss, aneconomist with DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm.   Business capital spending, another of the economy's brightspots, slowed in the third quarter, rising at an annual rate of 5.3percent. Analysts are looking for further declines in this area asbusinesses, hurt by falling profits, cut back on investment plans.   Housing construction, which has been in a slump as a result ofthe Federal Reserves's earlier credit squeeze to fight inflation,fell at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, thethird consecutive quarterly decline.   Consumer spending was essentially the only area of strength inthe July-September period as purchases shot up by 5.8 percent, thestrongest rise since the first quarter of 1988. Analysts attributedthe gain to the surge in car sales which resulted from the wave ofdiscounts offered by automakers to clear out an inventory of unsoldmodels.   However, economists say these discounts actually stole salesfrom the 1990 model year. For that reason, they believe consumerspending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity,will be exceptionally weak in the current October-December period.   The various changes left the economy, after adjusting forinflation, growing at an annual rate of $4.158 trillion in thethird quarter, up $25.6 billion from the second-quarter pace.</TEXT></DOC>
