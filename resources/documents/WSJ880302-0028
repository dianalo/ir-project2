A year earlier, tax credits and other gains made net income $17.4 million, or 63 cents a share. Revenue rose 21% to $415.3 million from $344.6 million.    IU also reported a 72% decline in earnings from continuing operations and indicated it might sell its troubled Candamp;H Transportation unit.    The decline could put added shareholder pressure on IU, which has already tried a recapitalization plan and a leveraged buy-out and is threatening to sell its food-distribution business in an effort to thwart Neoax's bid of $22 a share, or $664.4 million. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, IU shares closed at $21.875, unchanged.    IU said earnings from continuing operations fell to $2.9 million, or 10 cents a share, from $10.5 million, or 38 cents a share, in the 1986 quarter. IU said profit in its distribution and environmental businesses showed strong improvement, but overall results were diluted by &quot;a substantial loss&quot; by Candamp;H, a Dallas-based trucking line. IU declined to quantify the Candamp;H loss.    For the year, earnings from continuing operations rose 28% to $28.6 million, or $1.03 a share, from $22.4 million, or 81 cents a share, in 1986. Net fell 78% to $10.2 million, or 36 cents a share, from $46.5 million, or $1.69 a share. Revenue increased 17% to $1.6 billion from $1.4 billion.    Meanwhile, Stamford, Conn.-based Neoax protested IU's payment earlier this week of about $14.5 million in fees to Dean Witter Capital Corp., the leader of an investor group that had proposed a leveraged buy-out of IU at $21.50 a share.    After Neoax topped the Dean Witter bid, IU withdrew its endorsement of the buy-out plan, triggering the payment of the &quot;breakup&quot; fees. Neoax said it filed suit in federal court in Baltimore, seeking to block the $14.5 million payment. Neoax, a maker of customized vehicles and industrial and military equipment, said it believes there is no &quot;legal&quot; basis for the payment.    Dean Witter declined to comment on the Neoax action. But the Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. unit said it is still working on developing &quot;a winning solution&quot; and it hopes to respond to the latest Neoax bid by Friday. The Neoax offer expires Monday.    Industry analysts noted that the payment to Dean Witter exceeds IU's 1987 earnings. &quot;It doesn't make any sense,&quot; said Louis A. Marckesano, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. Clifford F. Ransom, an analyst at Baker, Watts andamp; Co. who owns some IU shares himself, said he thinks the $14.5 million fee &quot;was a stiff price to pay, and as a shareholder, I certainly don't welcome that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
