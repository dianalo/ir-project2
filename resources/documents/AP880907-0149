PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a lawsuit titled ``United States ofAmerica vs. 308 cardboard cases, more or less, of condoms,''federal officials don't want to leave condom quality control tosomeone else.   Federal prosecutors are asking a federal judge to order the U.S.Marshal's office to seize a batch of defective condoms from MentorCorp.'s warehouse in suburban Brooklyn Center. The lawsuit isagainst the product, not Mentor Corp.   The seizure would include about 44,350 condoms from a batch ofcontraceptives made for Mentor by an East Coast factory, saidassistant U.S. Attorney Roylene Champeaux.   Judge Paul Magnuson is expected to sign the seizure order laterthis week, Champeaux said. The marshal's service will confiscatethe condoms and officially put them in Magnuson's custody.   According to the government's complaint, Mentor will have untilNov. 10 to contest the seizure. If Mentor does not file a claim forthe return of the condoms, the government will destroy them,Champeaux said.   ``That would be fine,'' said Mentor spokesman Al Mannino. ``Thatwould save us the cost of destroying them.''   Mannino said he was baffled by the government's action becausehis company had informed the federal government that it was goingto destroy the condoms.   FDA inspectors declared the Mentor batch defective Aug. 1,Mannino said. A batch is substandard if more than three condoms ofa batch of 1,000 leak, he said.   On Aug. 18, Mentor's quality control officer signed an affidavitsaying the company would destroy them.   In the past, manufacturers were allowed to destroy the condomsand file affidavits with the FDA stating they had been destroyed,he said.   But the company recently was notified that the FDA is now takinga much tougher approach to condom quality control.   Comparing the suit to an admiralty law action, Champeaux said,``This is the same thing as seizing a ship.''   Mentor has headquarters in Minnesota and Santa Barbara, Calif.The company, which makes a variety of implantable devices andhealth care products, buys condoms from other manufacturers andadds an adhesive to the inside as well as an outer hood.</TEXT></DOC>
