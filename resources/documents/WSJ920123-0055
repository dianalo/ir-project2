The tomatoes were engineered to manufacture higher levelsof a naturally occurring enzyme, called chitinase, whichdegrades the cell walls of a fungus known as Botrytiscinerea. The fungus causes rotting of fruits when they areripe, said John Bedbrook, executive vice president anddirector of science at DNA Plant Technology, an agriculturalbiotechnology concern.</LP><TEXT>   In effect, he said, the plants are getting an enhancedimmune system. The test data indicate &quot;a significantopportunity for extending the shelf life of fresh marketproduce by increasing resistance to fungi which causepost-harvest rot without the use of fungicides,&quot; said Dr.Bedbrook. He said the genetically engineered varieties mightreach the market by the mid 1990s.   DNA Plant Technology shares rose 50 cents to $8 innational over-the-counter trading.</TEXT></DOC>
