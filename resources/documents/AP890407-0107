Material presented to the jury at North's trial in federal courton Thursday depicted Bush as more involved than previously believedin the Reagan administration's secret plan to aid the Contras. Bushwent to a meeting with then-President Robert Suazo in 1985,carrying a promise of additional U.S. aid, for example. Honduraswas supplying the Contras at the time.   There was no indication in the courtroom material that Bushlinked the speeded up U.S. aid with the Honduran assistance for theContras. But in earlier testimony, former national security adviserRobert McFarlane said the aid was part of a secret agreementdesigned to funnel aid to the rebels battling the Sandinistagovernment in Nicaragua.   It wasn't the first time Bush has been asked to explain his rolein the Iran-Contra affair that became the biggest scandal of theReagan administration.   He faced a barrage of questions early last year during thecampaign for the Republican presidential nomination _ including oneheated exchange with CBS anchorman Dan Rather _ and then laterfaced additional pressure on the subject from Democratic candidateMichael Dukakis. Throughout, he insisted he did not know of thediversion of funds from the sale of weapons to Iran to the Contras,and said he had little involvement in the Contra aid effort.</TEXT></DOC>
