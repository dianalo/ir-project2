Harold Ezell said Monday he led the prayer during an Aug. 3party where he also danced with Marcos' wife, Imelda, because thedeposed Philippine president had expressed a desire to return hometo bury his mother.   ``It has nothing to do with U.S. policy. It has something to dowith a human being who has feelings as I have,'' said Ezell,western regional commissioner of the U.S. Immigration andNaturalization Service.   Ezell said he now regrets attending the party at Marcos' mansionoverlooking Honolulu, but doesn't regret offering the prayer.   ``I think I can express my personal views,'' said Ezell. He saidhis father, a minister, also had died a year earlier and hesympathized with Marcos about the death of the ousted Philippinespresident's mother.   ``If it's wrong to pray for a person, I'll take the heat forthat,'' Ezell said.   Ezell, answering questions following a news conference topromote the agency's amnesty program, also said he didn't thinkthere was anything wrong with asking immigration officials fromseveral western states to join him in the prayer during the party.   ``Americans are free to do what they want,'' Ezell said. ``Theydon't have to join in. I'm not the commander or dictator of theimmigration service.''   A videotape obtained by The Honolulu Advertiser shows Ezellembracing Marcos and dancing with Marcos' wife while Ezell's wifedanced with the former president. The newspaper did not reveal thesource of the videotape.   ``Eat your heart out,'' Ezell called out as he danced with Mrs.Marcos to the beat of ``Don't Throw My Love Away.''   Ezell noted that the party was held before a New York grand juryindicted the Marcoses on racketeering charges in October. They areaccused of looting more than $100 million from the Philippines tobuy art and real estate in New York.   The commissioner said too much was being made of the immigrationofficials attending the event.   ``To me it's ridiculous, it's a social event,'' Ezell said.``But if I had to do it over again, I would not.''   U.S. policy since Marcos fled to exile in Hawaii in 1986 hasbeen to support Philippine President Corazon Aquino's repeatedrefusals to allow Marcos return home. Mrs. Aquino has citednational security in denying his requests.</TEXT></DOC>
