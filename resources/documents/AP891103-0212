In San Jose, Costa Rica, a Contra leader said Friday that theU.S.-backed rebels would not meet next week at the United Nationswith Sandinista representatives and proposed the meeting be delayeda week.   President Daniel Ortega on Friday instead proposed a shorterdelay in hopes that Honduran government officials also would attend.   Defense Ministry sources in Managua, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said fighting was going on in the mountains that runfrom the northern border with Honduras to the southeast.   They said the army struck in eight provinces where an estimated3,000 guerrillas were holed up in small bands. The Sandinistasoldiers were flown in by Soviet-built helicopters.   No information on casualties was forthcoming.   In Costa Rica, a well-placed Contra source said hundreds ofrebel fighters were fleeing Nicaragua and returning to base campsin Honduras.   ``Our soldiers scarcely have any ammunition and can't confrontan army as powerful as the Sandinistas that is using all of itsforce to annihilate us,'' he said, speaking on the condition of notbeing identified.   He said the fighters who have opted to remain on Nicaraguanterritory are under orders to take refuge in the most inaccessibleareas possible.   The offensive coincided with Ortega's announcement that he wasending a 19-month truce. He said he took the action because theContras had begun returning to Nicaragua from base camps to whichthey retreated in 1988.   One Sandinista field commander, Col. Roberto Calderon, toldgovernment radio on Friday that more troops were deployed in thepresent offensive than for a 1988 campaign that helped bring aboutthe truce.   A force of 4,000 Sandinista soldiers were deployed along thefrontier with Honduras in the 1988 push.   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada said Friday that troopsbacked by helicopter gunships attacked about 500 Contras in centralChontales province. It said helicopter troop carriers were beingused to ``persecute the criminals'' in La Pinuela and La Cusuca,170 miles east of the capital.   A Defense Ministry communique said Thursday that three rebelswere killed in El Guapote, 120 miles northeast of the capital inMatagalpa province. It said fighting in Pantasma and Plan de Gramain Jinotega wounded seven soldiers.   Government forces were reorganizing in northern Nueva Segovia,Madriz and Esteli provinces, Radio Sandino said.   Contra military commander Enrique Bermudez has said his troops,cut off from U.S. military aid for 21 months, will take onlyevasive action.   The Contras began returning to Nicaragua after Ortega and theother Central American presidents signed an agreement to disbandand relocate the rebels. The Contras have not agreed to beingdisbanded.   Bermudez says about 6,000 of the 12,000 fighters in Hondurashave crossed the border. U.S. officials put the number of Contrasin Nicaragua at about 4,000.   The Contras will not attend a meeting with Sandinista officialsproposed for Monday and Tuesday at the United Nations, saidWilfredo Montalvan, a director of the Nicaraguan Resistance, in SanJose. The meeting should be held Nov. 13 ``to be able to prepareourselves,'' he said.   Later Friday, Ortega said the meeting should be delayed untilThursday in hopes that Honduran officials would attend. TheHonduran government has said existing peace accords are sufficientand declined to send representatives to Ortega's proposed meeting.   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said the meeting at U.N.headquarters will be mediated by officials from the Organization ofAmerican States and the United Nations.   A senior U.N. official said privately the agenda will includethe agreement on disbanding the Contras as well as Sandinistapromises for free and fair presidential elections on Feb. 25.   He said the Contras are expected to insist on resumption of thecease-fire.</TEXT></DOC>
