It often feels that way for many homeowners, particularlynow, as they try to cut costs in the face of a slowingeconomy. But for those with adjustable-rate mortgages, it maypay to check: Thousands of mortgage holders may actually bepaying more than they should be on variable-rate loans,because the lenders have miscalculated periodic adjustmentsin the monthly payments.</LP><TEXT>   Unlike fixed-rate mortgages, which carry the same interestrate for the term of the loan, the rate on an adjustablemortgage changes periodically in line with a specific index.A specified amount, often between two and three percentagepoints, is added to the index to determine the mortgage rate.   Figuring out whether you are being overcharged is fairlyeasy, once you have all the information. When there is anerror, &quot;it's usually a question of using the wrong index orpicking the wrong week&quot; in figuring the adjustment, says PaulHavemann of HSH Associates, a mortgage-information service inButler, N.J.   Most lenders have automated systems to calculate theadjustments; some concede that there could be clerical errorsin entering the data.   For borrowers, the hard part of checking the rate on anadjustable-rate mortgage is often determining just what rateis used as the index. While federal regulations require thatindexes be publicly available, borrowers still sometimes havetrouble tracking them.   &quot;You have to read your loan document very carefully to seeexactly what it says,&quot; advises Michael Wilson, deputydirector of research for the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions.   There are indexes based on various Treasury securities,banks' and thrifts' cost of funds, and even on the Londoninterbank offered rate -- or Libor. Some indexes are based ona single date, others are moving averages. Some loans areadjusted monthly, others every six months, annually or everythree years.   Besides the index and the frequency of adjustments, theloan agreement stipulates the maximum change in eachadjustment period and for the life of the loan, as well aswhen the new rate is calculated. Lenders generally mustnotify mortgage holders of the new rate 45 days before ittakes effect.   If digging out the papers and looking up interest ratessounds like more bother than it's worth, keep in mind that arecent report from the General Accounting Office, theinvestigative arm of Congress, said some analysts believe asmany as a quarter of adjustable-rate mortgages may have beenbilled incorrectly. Mr. Havemann of HSH Associates says thatbetween 10% and 20% of the thousands of homeowners who havecalled in the past few years seeking help calculating theirpayments have found errors.   Although the GAO said federal law probably doesn't requirelenders to reimburse consumers for any overcharges, somefinancial institutions have already issued refunds. HSH saysmost lenders probably would give borrowers a choice of havingoverpayments credited against their mortgage or receiving acheck for the full amount. The rate would also be adjustedfor future payments.   Here's a look at some indexes and how to find out aboutthem.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities. Interest rates on six-month andone-year Treasury bills and on three-year and five-yearTreasury notes often are used for adjustable-rate mortgageindexes, particularly on the East Coast. Some lenders takethe rate on a certain day, usually 45 days before adjustmentdate; others use a weekly average.   Rates and yields on Treasury securities are published inthis newspaper and in the business section of many localpapers. The Federal Reserve Board also publishes thesenumbers. Individuals can get on the mailing list for theFed's release H-15, issued weekly, and G-13, issued monthly,by contacting the publications office of the Federal Reservein Washington. Mr. Wilson of the U.S. League of Savingsrecommends getting both. The total cost is $20 a year. (Writeto: Publications Services, Federal Reserve Board, 20th andConstitution Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20551.)                                                                                                          Cost-of-Funds Indexes. The 11th District Cost of Fundsindex, issued monthly by the Federal Home Loan Bank in SanFrancisco, is more popular among West Coast lenders. The bankhas a telephone hotline (415-616-2600) with a recordedannouncement giving the index.   The national median cost of funds is a weighted averagereported monthly by the Office of Thrift Supervision inWashington. Although the office's toll-free telephone numberhas been discontinued, individuals can get on a mailing listfor the monthly release by calling the thrift agency's publicaffairs office (202-906-6677).                                                                                                          Libor. The London Interbank Offered Rate, an interbanklending rate used by London banks on dollar-denominateddeposits, can vary daily. It is published in this newspaperand in business sections of some local papers.   The various indexes also are available through severalcomputerized data bases.   What happens if after figuring it all out borrowersdiscover that they are being undercharged? HSH Associatessays that in most states the lender probably can't billmortgage holders for the difference.</TEXT></DOC>
