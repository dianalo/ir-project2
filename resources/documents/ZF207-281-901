Trimarchi saidhe expects a generic commodity market to develop.andM;&quot;Anyone who ships a SCSI Winchester today can ship a SCSI optical tomorrow.andO;They are totally interchangeable.andP;  That's the beauty of SCSI,&quot; Trimarchisaid, explaining that there is no difference between the interfaces for themagnetic and optical drives.andM;The SCSI erasable optical drive market can also be a &quot;retrofit&quot; market,Trimarchi said.andM;He said any of his customers who have a SCSI-based Exabyte 8mm drive can plugan erasable optical drive into the tape drive controller.andM;How rapidly the market develops depends, in part, on how customers perceivethe new technology, according to Trimarchi.andM;&quot;We're hoping the market doesn't approach [the erasable optical subsystem] asa new whiz-bang device and [doesn't' approach it slowly.andP;  It's just anothermedia,&quot; he said.andM;If customers react cautiously, Trimarchi said, it could take a year before asignificant market develops.andM;Most analysts indicate that erasable optical subsystems will be usedprimarily for backup and archiving applications.andM;Until the performance level of the drives approaches the level of magneticdisk drives, analysts don't expect much pressure on the magnetic disk marketfrom erasable optical drives.andM;Trimarchi noted that the removable Winchester drive market is one area whereerasable optical technology could affect magnetic drives in the future, asoptical disk media costs significantly less than an entire hard disk drive.andM;Trimarchi's Las-er-ase is MSCP-compatible and features a SCSI controller fromTD Systems of Lowell, Mass.andM;Using this controller, subsystems can be configured with magnetic disks,optical disks and tape drives all on the same controller, according toTrimarchi.andM;There are three drive manufacturers, Ricoh, Sony and Maxtor, who supplyerasable optical drives.andM;Trimarchi said that although his company is using Ricoh initially, hiscompany plans to evaluate drives from all the manufacturers.andM;The Ricoh drive offers an average access time of 61 milliseconds and a peaktransfer rate of 1.2MB per second, according to Trimarchi.andM;The subsystem has a 5-1/4-inch form factor and a capacity of 600MB percartridge.andM;The media conforms to an International Standards Organization format so thtthe media is interchangeable between different computers, according toTrimarchi.andM;The Las-er-ase is available for Q-bus, Unibus and the busless MicroVAX 2000systems, and in internal and external configurations.andP;  They subsystems areavailable now.andM;The price for an internal Las-er-ase is $5,295.andM;For further information, Trimarchi Inc. can be contacted at P.O.
