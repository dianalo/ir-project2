An initialtest of 500 hours in duration showed sustained activity and selectivityup to 250 hours after which changes in selectivity were followed by deactivation.A repeat test has shown that the absence of adequate, new charcoal trapscauses the same selectivity changes and deactivation to occur from startof testing. Complete analysis of the catalysts after testing has beenperformed to determine the cause of the selectivity changes and deactivation.Results indicate that the cause of the problems is related to iron contamination.Iron deposition on the catalyst surface leads to Fischer-Tropsch centersthat form waxes under the present reaction conditions and block the activesites for C{sub 1}-C{sub 4} alcohol synthesis. 14 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
