Deaver had been drinking up to afifth of Scotch whisky a day when he first sought treatment foralcoholism only several weeks after he left President Reagan'sstaff, according to testimony.   Deaver's wife, Carolyn, told a doctor that her husband drank``bottles and bottles of wine'' the weekend before he washospitalized on June 3, 1985, for alcohol detoxification, Dr.William Argy testified Thursday at a court hearing on the formerpresidential aide's medical condition.   Deaver is trying to get a lenient sentence for lying under oathabout his lobbying activities by presenting evidence that hismemory was impaired by alcoholism when he gave sworn testimonybefore a grand jury and a House subcommittee in 1986.   Argy said Deaver was drinking as much as a bottle of wine or apint of vodka a day when he was hospitalized in October 1986 fordetoxification.   The former deputy White House chief of staff and longtime friendof the Reagan family faces a possible five-year term and a $6,800fine for each of three perjury convictions when he appears Sept. 23for sentencing by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.   Deaver was found guilty of two counts of lying by telling thegrand jury he couldn't recall contacting former Reaganadministration colleagues on behalf of high-paying lobbyingclients. The third conviction stemmed from his denial to the HouseEnergy and Commerce subcomittee that he helped a South Korean tradeenvoy get an appointment to see the president.   At Thursday's hearing, defense lawyer Randall J. Turk toldJackson that evidence would show that Deaver was an alcoholic ``atall times relevant to the case'' and therefore his memory wasimpaired both during the events in question and when he was askedabout them under oath.   But independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. argued thatrecords of Deaver's hospitalization for alcoholism in June 1985 andagain in October 1986 show ``nothing to support any finding thathis memory was impaired.''   ``Mr. Deaver's ability to recall was absolutely functioning, itwas just that he decided to select what he wanted to recall,''Seymour argued.   Medical experts for both the defense and prosecution wereexpected to testify when the hearing resumed.   A Roman Catholic priest who runs an alcoholism treatment centerin Havre de Grace, Md., where Deaver spent a month following hissecond hospitalization said the former presidential aide complainedof memory blackouts when he was first admitted.   Prosecutors showed the Rev. Joseph Martin a treatment notationstating that during his stay Deaver ``enjoyed a nightly game ofTrivial Pursuits'' _ a game that challenges players' memory offacts about popular culture and other subjects.   ``Many of us have a little storehouse of useless information,you can show it in a game like that,'' Martin said.   Martin said Deaver came to realize that his drinking problemoccurred because he ``abused power and money.''   Argy, who had earlier treated Deaver for kidney failure,testified that the former presidential aide called him on May 30,1985, to seek help with alcoholism. On June 3, 1985, Deaver wasadmitted to Georgetown University Hospital for detoxification.   The defense tried to use this testimony to show that Deaver wasnot lying when he said he couldn't recall telephoningthen-Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole or White House aideRogert Porter from his hospital bed on behalf of Trans WorldAirlines.   The calls were made ``while he was going through acute alcoholwithdrawal and while he was sedated'' by tranquilizers, Turk argued.   Argy said Deaver received between 120 and 140 milligrams ofValium to counteract the effects of alcohol withdrawal during histhree-day hospital stay.   But Seymour was able to show that Deaver did not receive anyValium until 45 minutes after he had telephoned Mrs. Dole on June 3.   According to Argy, Deaver was given his first tranquilizer _ a25-milligram dose of Librium _ 45 minutes before the 5 p.m. call toDole, which was documented by a telephone log produced at the trial.   The call to Porter was the next day.   The medical testimony about Deaver's alcoholism was not offeredduring the trial because defense lawyers rested their case withoutcalling any witnesses.</TEXT></DOC>
