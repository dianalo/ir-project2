Gorbachev if push comes to shove atthe summit in Moscow, former president Richard M. Nixon said today.   ``Ronald Reagan can certainly handle him as a heavyweight,provided Ronald Reagan has the kind of advice he as a leader shouldhave as president of the United States, provided he iswell-briefed,'' Nixon said in the second of four consecutive dayson NBC.   In an hour-long interview on the network's ``Meet the Press''show Sunday, Nixon said the president should pardon John M.Poindexter and Oliver L. North if he believes they engineered theIran-Contra deal to serve the presidency.   Nixon said that he regrets not absolving his own advisers fortheir role in the Watergate scandal.   Appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program this morning, Nixon saidthere is no question there has been a tendency to underestimateReagan ``because he sometimes forgets something or doesn't handlepress conferences well.''   But, Nixon said, Reagan proved he could handle Gorbachev attheir summit in Reykjavik, Iceland when he ``finally said no whenit was a bad deal.''   ``With what happened in the Iran-Contra thing, certainly he wasnot hands on,'' said Nixon. ``He is hands on where it reallymatters.''   The former president had stressed the necessity for such aleader in his new book, ``1999,'' which he is promoting with thetelevision apperances and other interviews.   Nixon said the most significant foreign policy achievement ofthe Reagan administration will be the withdrawal of Soviet troopsfrom Afghanistan _ ``because it is the first time the Soviet Unionhas withdrawn forces from a country it invaded.'' Without Soviettroop support, he said, he doubts Afghanistan's communistgovernment can survive.   Nixon, who will be appear again on ``Today'' Tuesday andWednesday, discussed possible pardons for Poindexter and NorthSunday in the most extensive of the interviews.   The former president, who was driven from office in 1974 byWatergate, said Reagan should ask himself, ``Did these two men dowhat they did, believing, whether mistakenly or not, that they hadthe approval of the president, or were acting in order to serve hisinterests and would get that approval?   ``If the president, after considering that, believes that thatwas the case, then he, the president, would have a good case forpardoning, because then the so-called crime would lack in intent,''Nixon said.   Poindexter, the former national security adviser, and North, whoserved as a National Security Council aide, face charges ofconspiring to divert proceeds of U.S.-Iran arms sales to theNicaraguan rebels at a time when Congress banned military aid tothe Contras.   Reagan has made several comments indicating he believes hisformer aides did nothing illegal and suggesting that he isfavorably inclined toward pardons. But his official position on thesubject remains one of neutrality, according to White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   Nixon said that in the early 1970s he asked himself aboutpardoning former advisers H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman.Both were convicted on charges of conspiracy and obstruction ofjustice and served time in prison.   ``I probably should have pardoned them,'' Nixon said. ``I'm notsure that the country would have taken it at that time _ it was alittle stirred up, as you might imagine. But, on the other hand,they had not done it for personal gain.''   The former president said ``personal gain'' also was not aconsideration in the Iran-Contra affair.   On ``Meet the Press,'' the 75-year-old Nixon also was questionedabout Attorney General Edwin Meese III, U.S.-Israel relations andVietnam.   _On Meese, who is under investigation, Nixon said there arethree points for the president to consider:   ``One, is he an honest man; and two, has he been a competentattorney general; and three, is he a political liability. ... Ithink he is an honest man. As far as the second matter isconcerned, President Reagan believes he's a competent attorneygeneral in carrying out his conservative agenda. The third point,however, is the one you're really addressing, and that is, is he apolitical liability. And that's something only he (Reagan) cananswer.''   _On U.S-Israel relations: ``The problems in the Mideast are socomplex that it can't be done by the secretary of state on apart-time basis. ... There has to be the appointment of a full-timeheavyweight negotiator, and that appointment should be made ... toHenry Kissinger. Now, Henry is devious, Henry is difficult, somepeople think he's obnoxious _ but he's a terrific negotiator. And Iwould suggest that the next president, be it (Michael) Dukakis or(George) Bush, would be well-advised to give him the title ofambassador plenipotentiary, give him a year, and he will work outsome settlement.''   _On Vietnam: ``I would say the major mistake I made as presidentwas ... not doing early in 1969 what I did on May 3 of 1972 and onDec. 15 of 1972, and that was to bomb and mine North Vietnam. ...If we had done that then, I think we would have ended the war inVietnam in 1969 rather than in 1973.''</TEXT></DOC>
