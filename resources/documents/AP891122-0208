(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The leaders of Eastern Airlines pilots unionvoted Wednesday to end their bitter sympathy strike and notifiedthe company they were ready to return to work.   The abrupt decision, eight months into a strike by the carrier'sMachinists union, deals a severe blow to both the Machinists andorganized labor, which has used the pilots support of the strike asa symbol of its newfound solidarity.   Wayne Dolan, an Eastern pilot and spokesman for the Air LinePilots Association, said the union's 20-member Master ExecutiveCouncil for Eastern made the decision at a meeting in Reston, asuburb of Washington.   He said the union would notify Eastern management the pilotswere ready to return to work. Eastern has been hiring replacementpilots and using the union pilots who crossed picket lines and itwas not immediately clear whether it would welcome the strikingpilots back.   Technically, under the Railway Labor Act which governs airlinecontract disputes, only the Machinists are on strike. The pilotsand Eastern's union flight attendants have been honoring Machinistpickets in legal sympathy strikes.   The airline has replaced many of the 3,600 pilots who went onstrike March 4 with non-union pilots, and Eastern said Wednesdaythere were no jobs for the strikers _ 2,250 remaining as ofWednesday _ to return to.   John Peterpaul, vice president of the International Associationof Machinists, said in a telephone interview late Wednesday,``We're not calling this thing off.''   ``What they (the pilots) do is their affair,'' he said.   Eastern said in a statement issued at its Miami headquarters:``It's a very interesting development. Our only regret is that itdidn't come earlier and we could have avoided all the trauma thathas come to Eastern Airlines.''   Eastern said returning pilots ``will be recalled as jobs comeopen in the future'' and invited them to sign the recall list.There airline has 1,800 pilots currently.   The Machinists went on strike after refusing to agree to ademand for $150 million in concessions on wages, work rules andother subjects by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parentcompany, Texas Air Corp. The Machinists said later they would agreeto similar or greater concessions if Lorenzo would sell Eastern,but sale attempts have fallen through.   The stunning decision by the pilots union came a day afterPresident Bush vetoed a bill that would have created a specialcongressional panel to investigate the strike and propose asolution.   Congress can't try to override the veto until it reconvenes intwo months. Peterpaul said he thought there was a good chanceCongress would vote to override.   ALPA President Henry Duffy spoke to the Eastern council meeting.Duffy last week was denied a seat on the AFL-CIO Executive Councilafter narrowly missing being chosen for a vacancy two years ago. Hewas said to be irate at not being chosen, particularly because ofthe support ALPA has given the Machinists.   Sources who attended the meeting said Duffy endorsed a return towork.   The pilots union has a history of crossing the picket lines ofother unions, limiting the effectiveness of airline strikes. But itstood with the Machinists until Wednesday, though more than 200pilots had returned to work on their own, according to Eastern andunion officials.   ``The decision to return to work was the most difficult decisionwe have had to make since Eastern was acquired by Texas AirCorp.,'' said Skip Copeland, head of ALPA's Eastern MasterExecutive Council.   Copeland blamed Bush's veto for the decision, saying it left thepilots with little choice but to return to work because prospectsfor a settlement of the Machinists strike in the near future werevirtually non-exisstent.   Copeland said the decision ``is a best a small victory'' forEastern and Lorenzo, but it in fact should give Eastern more thanenough pilots to complete its planned reorganization.   Copeland replaced Jack Bavis in August, who was recalled by themembership after he endorsed a return to work then.   Eastern, which filed for bankruptcy protections five days afterthe strike began, has been rebuilding by hiring replacementworkers, and pilot shortages and training problems have been thebiggest personnel problem.   However, it was not clear that pilot shortages were now aproblem. ``They've got all the pilot they need,'' said Paul Karos,airline analyst at First Boston Corp. ``The strike has been mainlysymbolic.''   Copeland said the pilots have been instructed to contact thecompany about returning to work.   ``The time has come now to go back, rebuild Eastern and get onwith our lives and professions,'' Copeland said.   The White House announced the veto at 11:35 p.m. Tuesday; themeasure would have become law at midnight had Bush not acted bythen. In his veto message, Bush said Congress, which would haveconducted the investigation, had no business interfering in thecontract and court disputes over the 8-month-old strike. He refusedin March to use his power to block the strike by naming anemergency mediation board.   Lorenzo, in a letter to Bush, praised the president for havingthe political courage to veto the measure and ``a clear vision ofthe need to keep the airline industry competitive.''   But the president's action prompted stinging attacks fromEastern's unions, which pointedly recalled Bush's remarks to theAFL-CIO convention last week praising the role of unions inpromoting democracy and workers' rights abroad.   ``There, he expressed concern for working men and women andtheir families,'' said George Kourpias, president of theMachinists. ``By vetoing the Eastern bill, he kicked a largesegment of those workers in the teeth.''   The unions accused Bush of supporting what they deem as effortsby Lorenzo to use the bankruptcy protection to reorganize Easternas a non-union carrier.   ``By failing to sign the Eastern bill, the president embracedthe meanest, worker-hating boss in the nation, Frank Lorenzo,''said George Kourpias, president of the Machinists union.   ``The president has dropped any pretense of fairness and chosensides with Frank Lorenzo, a symbol of the worst type of Americanemployer,'' the AFL-CIO said in a statement that called the veto``a strong message to every working American that the president isnot on their side.''</TEXT></DOC>
