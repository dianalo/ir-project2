<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-38-0449 </DOCNO><TEXT>The computer programs described provide a tool to the power-electroniccircuit designer for the rapid, optimum design of transformers and D.C.chokes, without magnetic expertise and judgmental decisions on the criticalparameters of maximum flux density and current density, and without interpolationof graphical data on core loss. The programs eliminate the iterationof virtually complete designs for credible optimum design, when usinga priori judgment on the critical parameters. A program run is completedin two minutes on a desk-top computer, permitting rapid evaluation ofalternative core materials. A minimum weight, thermally limited designmay be rapidly compared with a higher weight, higher efficiency design.Analysis of optimum design, and program logic are discussed. Typicaldesign print-outs are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
