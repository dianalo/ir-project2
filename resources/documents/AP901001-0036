HOSTETLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mammograms would be cheaper and perhaps moreeffective in preventing breast cancer deaths if the United Statesdid not have as many mammography machines, researchers reportedtoday.   The researchers from the National Institutes of Health and theFood and Drug Administration reported in the Annals of InternalMedicine that the country has 3{ times more mammography machinesthan it needs.   Martin L. Brown of the National Cancer Institute, the report'slead author, said the high number of the X-ray screening devicesreduces the number of patients per machine, keeping costs high.   And with so many facilities using the machnnes, it's unlikelythey can afford the record-keeping and follow-up care that makemammography useful in preventing deaths from breast cancer, hesaid.   An accompanying editorial by Dr. Alvin Mushlin of the Universityof Rochester Medical Center also warned that the oversupply of``mammography units may ultimately lead to a situation in whichmore care does not mean better care, and it certainly is unlikelyto mean more cost-effective care.''   Researchers estimate that each year, 150,000 American womendevelop breast cancer and 44,000 die of the disease.   Breast cancer rates could be lowered about 30 percent if womenreceived mammograms as recommended by the National CancerInstitute, according to earlier studies. About one-third of womeneligible get regular screenings, the Centers for Disease Controlreported.   Although an estimated 10,000 mammography machines were installedby 1990, the actual need is only about 2,600, the authors said.   If doctors lowered the average cost of a screening test from$100 to $50 by using fewer machines, the country could save $763million a year in health costs, Brown said.</TEXT></DOC>
