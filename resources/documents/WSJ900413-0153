But as Mikhail Gorbachev moves toward what he calls a&quot;regulated market economy,&quot; this longstanding social contractwith the Soviet people is about to be broken. Officials saythe new Soviet economic package, due later this month, willinevitably bring mass unemployment and big price increasesfor basic goods.</LP><TEXT>   Government economists insist that the changes are vital tohalt the economy's slide and bring about lastingimprovements. But as many admit, the crucial unansweredquestion is whether the Soviet public is willing to pay sucha price, especially in the short term. If they aren't, thealready beleaguered President Gorbachev could face thetoughest challenge of his five years in office.   &quot;An explosion will occur that {the government} doesn'texpect,&quot; predicts Alexei Sergeyev, an economist who teachesat the Labor Unions' Higher School. He warns that massstrikes and social unrest could quickly erupt. &quot;People willinitially say it's OK {to change to a market economy} as longas it makes life better. But as soon as they see ittranslates into millions of unemployed and price increaseswithout compensation, they'll say no.&quot;   Even government economists who are drafting the new plansecho some of Mr. Sergeyev's fears. They concede that theirbiggest problem is devising measures to cushion the impact ofan economic overhaul that won't render the whole packageineffective.   &quot;Any radical reform needs certain agreement among socialforces,&quot; says Leonid Abalkin, a deputy prime minister and keyarchitect of the new legislation. He and other economists saythe package will include provisions such as index-linkedsocial benefits and unemployment insurance.   Because of fears of social upheaval, it will be softer andslower than Poland's economic &quot;shock therapy.&quot; Mr. Abalkinworries that after five years perestroika and broken promisesof a better life, the government &quot;doesn't have the trust ofthe people.&quot; But he insists: &quot;We shouldn't back down in theface of disagreement or resentment.&quot;   The greatest threat to the reforms is likely to come fromSoviet workers. Even before they are faced with the prospectof unemployment, workers in many parts of the country arefurious about dwindling supplies of food and consumer goods.   This month, oil field workers in Western Siberiathreatened to strike in protest against chronic housingshortages and poor living standards. The strike was postponedafter Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov met with them to calmtheir anger. But labor officials say the crisis is far fromover.   Coal miners in Siberia and the Ukraine are alsoincreasingly militant. They complain the government hasn'tdelivered many of the improvements it promised last year whenit settled a nationwide miners' strike. Mr. Sergeyev, whorecently visited coal fields in Siberia, says the miners aretalking about new strikes. &quot;The situation is very tense,&quot; hesays.   To head off potential unrest that could crippleimplementation of his reforms, several government officialssay Mr. Gorbachev may ban strikes. If he does, it isuncertain how he would enforce it. Such a move could alienatethe huge official labor movement, which is urgently seekingto regain its credibility with workers. Some officials areconcerned that the labor unions may seize on the economicoverhaul as a way to strengthen their political authority.   So far, labor representatives won't talk publicly abouttheir plans. But, &quot;last September we took a decision todefend workers,&quot; says Pyotr Fyodorov, a senior official atthe unions' headquarters in Moscow. &quot;In the past, laborunions were linked to defending and implementing {thenation's economic} plans, and people got lost. We now saythat isn't right.&quot;   The unions have already shown their clout by forcing thegovernment to retract price rises on diesel fuel, freight andelectricity supplies to industry that were supposed to beginat the beginning of this year. They have also persuaded thegovernment to scale down its plans to sell many goods inshort supply at auctions.   To assuage the unions, Mr. Gorbachev has included one ofthe most militant labor officials, Veniamin Yarin, on hiscouncil of presidential advisers, which plays a big role insetting the reforms.   Mr. Gorbachev may also face trouble pushing his measuresthrough parliament. It has already rejected planned priceincreases on beer and cigarettes. Pavel Bunich, a legislatorand economist, says &quot;resistance will be there,&quot; when theparliament debates the government's new program, though hebelieves a majority will approve it.   Raising prices is a particularly sensitive issue in theSoviet Union because the cost of many consumer goods andfoodstuffs has remained unchanged for years, sometimesdecades. The government now spends about $160 billion a yearon subsidies. The economic distortions are enormous: Theretail price of meat is about half the cost of the grain thatis fed to cattle, for example.   Even if it makes economic sense, adjusting prices will beextremely hard on people long used to being told that stableprices are a fundamental human right. &quot;For their whole life,people have believed that meat should cost two rubles perkilo, and if the state charges 15 rubles it will be a shock,&quot;says Alexei Slavich-Pristupa, a reform economist. &quot;It isn'timportant that meat can be bought twice a week or every day.It's just important that it costs two rubles.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
