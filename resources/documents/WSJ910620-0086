We mean, they really lost it.   That's the figure compiled by the Securities InformationCenter, a Wellesley Hills., Mass., company that tracks lost,missing, stolen or counterfeit securities. The $2.6 billionfigure is about 21% higher than for 1989.</LP><TEXT>   Losing certificates is the easy part. Folks misplace themor burn them by mistake or mutilate them. Certificates getstolen. Divorcing couples hide them from each other. Thenthere are even less-honest folks who confuse matters byprinting their own.   Most common, says Securities Information Center's generalmanager, John Boehmke, is Mom or Pop simply forgetting wherethe certificates are -- the &quot;I thought I put them in the topdesk drawer&quot; syndrome. Criminal activities account for about2% of the certificate problems tracked by the company, hesaid.   A shareholder reports such a loss to his broker ortransfer agent, who is a member of Securities Information.The broker or agent then replaces the certificate, and thenumber is recorded on the Securities Information computersystem. When the shares are later sold, if the sale is$10,000 or more, the broker calls Securities Information tocheck on the status of the shares. That is intended toprevent anyone from trying to sell two different certificatesfor the same shares.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which released thefigures, is studying whether to discourage use of stockcertificates and to urge shareholders to rely more heavily onelectronic records of their holdings. The SEC, however, hassaid it won't compel investors to part with their stockcertificates altogether.   Thomas Etter, an attorney in the SEC's market-regulationdivision, said the recovery rate on lost or stolencertificates appears to be improving, primarily because morefirms are signing up and calling in their certificateproblems. In fact, the amount recovered last year shot up to$130.9 million, from $10.7 million the year before.   Some certificate &quot;losses&quot; run toward the illicit. Take thesituation of the $100,000 in bearer bonds brought into a NewJersey brokerage house. The firm became suspicious and askedthe bearer for his confirmation tickets. The man leftquickly, contending that he had to find them. He returned thenext day with a note written in Arabic stating that he was tohold the bonds and sell them on instruction.   The firm became even more suspicious. It took down thenumbers of the bonds and, while Mr. Boehmke won't talk aboutit, has turned the case over to federal law-enforcementauthorities.</TEXT></DOC>
