These two proteins have only 26% amino acid homology yet bindto the same receptor. It is of importance to define the active sitesof these molecules in order to understand their receptor interactionsand the mechanisms involved in their multiple biological functions. Theyauthors report here the localization of the biologically active portionswithin the initial polypeptide translation products. An in vitro transcriptionand translation system was used to generate specific fragments of eachof the IL-1 molecules, which then were assayed for receptor binding capabilityand biological activity. Using this system, they have demonstrated thatcore sequences of 147 amino acids for IL-1{beta} (numbers 120-266) and140 amino acids for IL-1{alpha} (numbers 128-267) must be left intactto retain full biological activity and further that the biological activitiesof the IL-1 polypeptides parallel their receptor binding capabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
