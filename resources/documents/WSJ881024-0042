The ruling will allow the 3,150 member companies of the National Tooling and Machinery Association to engage in joint price-setting and bidding in the sale of their products to foreign buyers. The members are mainly smaller companies producing tools and dies, machinery parts and molds on a contract basis for various manufacturing industries.    In addition to agreeing among themselves on export prices, the companies will be allowed to offer jointly operated warranty, service and training centers in various export markets.    The Commerce Department ruling, authorized under the Export Trading Company Act, was approved after consultation with Justice Department antitrust officials. Commerce Department officials said similar antitrust shields have been issued to such trade groups as the National Machine Tool Builders Association and the American Film Marketing Association. </TEXT></DOC>
