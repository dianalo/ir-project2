Goldberg said he was convinced after three days of congressional hearings into ethical conduct and standards at the IRS that improvements need to be made at the agency.    Testifying before the House Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee, Mr. Goldberg pledged to take a hard look at the way the agency investigates allegations of wrongdoing among its employees. He said he has already recommended several changes to improve that &quot;inspection&quot; system.    &quot;It is clear that we can improve the inspection function, and we will improve the inspection function,&quot; said Mr. Goldberg, who became commissioner July 4.    Mr. Goldberg ardently defended the overall integrity of the 120,000-employee IRS, which will collect over $1 trillion in taxes this year. &quot;These hearings have focused on several specific instances of bad judgment, misconduct and possible criminal wrongdoing,&quot; he said. &quot;They have not addressed the exemplary conduct and accomplishments of more than 120,000 dedicated, capable and honorable IRS employees.&quot;    The hearings follow a yearlong investigation by the subcommittee focusing on eight cases of alleged misconduct by 25 IRS senior employees in offices across the country. These include incidents in which high-level employees allegedly accepted gratuities and provided confidential tax information and one case in which an IRS official improperly intervened in a Justice Department examination as a favor to a friend.    During three all-day subcommittee hearings, a number of current and former employees also told the panel they were intimidated and harassed by superiors after reporting misconduct by colleagues. The subcommittee contends that the IRS was lax in investigating most of the cases. In the first day of hearings, subcommittee investigators said only one of the individuals involved had been punished; IRS officials said many of them left the agency before the investigations were concluded. IRS officials also said that most of the cases have been referred to the Justice Department.    Meanwhile, Rep. Bill Alexander (D., Ark.) accused the IRS of blocking efforts to investigate an alleged drugs-for-arms operation between Mena, Ark., and Central America from 1984 to 1986. Mr. Alexander said two congressional committees and law enforcement officials had sought access to William Duncan, then a veteran IRS agent who was investigating a money-laundering scheme linked to the alleged operation. The lawmaker said the IRS wouldn't cooperate.    Mr. Duncan, the agent, later told the lawmakers that he had received an unsubstantiated telephone tip involving possible bribery of a high government official connected to the case. He said an IRS attorney told him to withhold that information when he was called to testify before Congress last year. IRS officials disputed Mr. Duncan's claims, and the agent eventually did testify. But he said the matter led him to quit the agency.    Subcommittee members may push to increase oversight of the vast tax-collecting agency, possibly by transferring responsibility for some policing from the agency itself to the office of the Treasury Department's inspector general or by creating a separate IRS inspector general appointed by the president.    But former IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs and Senior Deputy Commissioner Michael Murphy told the committee that would be a mistake. Mr. Gibbs said having political appointees police the IRS could open the way for political manipulation and misuse such as that which occurred in the 1970s, when the Nixon administration used private tax information to go after political enemies.    Mr. Goldberg said he had no opinion yet on the issue.    Mr. Goldberg said the IRS is installing an improved computer system to investigate alleged abuses by employees. The agency also plans to set up a hotline for employees to report misconduct directly to IRS headquarters in Washington rather than to inspectors in local offices who may be too close to the subjects they are supposed to investigate. He also promised to review the training of inspection officials.    Mr. Goldberg added, &quot;I will not tolerate harassment of whistleblowers.&quot;    Subcommittee members intend to continue their hearings in September. And they seem to think the agency has a huge task ahead.    After Mr. Murphy defended the agency's integrity and described the agency's successes in punishing wrongdoing, Rep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.), the subcommittee chairman, angrily retorted, &quot;The IRS world you describe, where wrongdoings are systematically punished and whistleblowers are applauded, is an IRS world I don't recognize, not from our investigations.    &quot;The real {IRS} world,&quot; the lawmaker added, &quot;is where employees are afraid to come forward because of retaliation. The real world of IRS is where if you're not a team player, you're off the team. I do not agree with your characterization of the IRS one bit.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
