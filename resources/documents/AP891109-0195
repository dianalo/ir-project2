The national Centers for Disease Control looked at 29 injurydeaths associated with Hurricane Hugo, as reported by officials in25 South Carolina counties. Thirteen of those deaths, the CDC said,occurred during the ``impact phase'' of the storm's assault on thestate Sept. 21-22.   The pattern was different in Puerto Rico, where the storm struckdays earlier. There, only two of nine deaths occurred during thestorm's impact; most of the deaths were electrocutions among repairworkers after the storm.   The CDC said, however, that in both Puerto Rico and SouthCarolina, the historical hurricane pattern of death by drowning instorm surges did not hold. The CDC reported just one storm-surgedrowning in South Carolina, a 60-year-old woman who died in hermobile home.   Five other people drowned while trying to bring boats inland atCharleston.   The other impact-phase deaths in South Carolina included fourpeople crushed in mobile homes, one person killed in the collapseof a house and two killed by falling trees.   Most of the 16 injury deaths after the storm involved ninepeople who were killed in five separate house fires. The fires wereblamed on the use of candles during power outages.   Four people were electrocuted during clean-up and repair work,two people were killed by falling trees and one died in a chain-sawmishap.   With the South Carolina deaths in mind, the CDC on Thursdayrecommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areasabout the hazards of candles, the need to evacuate mobile homes andthe hazards of boating during the approach of a killer storm.   After the deaths in Puerto Rico, the CDC last month recommendedgreater precautions for electrical workers repairing hurricanedamage.</TEXT></DOC>
