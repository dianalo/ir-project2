Omar Sheradan, a spokesman for the Jamiat-i-Islami rebel group,said a guerrilla rocket attack destroyed about half the air base atShindand during an attack last week.   He said the guerrilla faction's field commander, Ismail Khan, ledan estimated 500 rebel fighters in the attack on the air base and aring of security posts.   Rebels said they overran 12 government positions protecting thebase, killing 160 soldiers and destroying two helicopter gunshipsand two MiG fighter bombers.   Rebels also claimed they destroyed 80 of an estimated 950vehicles in a government convoy that had reportedly originated atTorghundi, near the Soviet border, and was trying to reach the cityof Kandahar 350 miles to the northwest, Western diplomats said.   Sheradon confirmed the attack and said 150 Communist troops diedin the fighting. There was no date of the attack or report of rebelcasualties.   Diplomats, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said theattack on Shindand airbase crippled air cover for the massive convoy.   ``The ability of regime forces to protect the convoy may beimpeded over the next several days because of a major resistancerocket attack on Shndand air base,'' said a diplomatic report.   Sheradon said the base was closed.   Afghanistan's second-largest city of Kandahar is located in thesouth, about 270 miles south of the Afghan capital, Kabul. Rebelsources said in recent months Kandahar had been resupplied almostexclusively by air.   U.S.-backed guerrillas have been fighting for more than a decadeto topple the Communist government. On Feb. 15, the last of anestimated 110,000 Soviet soldiers, who had been fighting along sidetheir Afghan allies for nine years, left Afghanistan.   As the summer fighting season draws to a close, rebels havestepped up their attacks on Communist positions throughout thecountry.   Heavy fighting is reported around the Communist garrison town ofKhost in eastern Afghanistan, 10 miles from the Pakistan border.   A rebel victory at Khost would open a direct rebel supply linkfrom Pakistan to fighters in northern and western Afghanistan, rebelsources said.   Rebel rockets have pounded the airport at Kabul, causing some ofthe heaviest casualties in recent months. Sixteen people were killedand another 52 were injured when a barrage of rockets battered theairport on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
