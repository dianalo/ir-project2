For the first time since 1969, legislators here are poisedto increase the state's cigarette tax. Facing a budgetshortfall of more than $1 billion, the state's House ofRepresentatives has passed a bill that would boost the tax toseven cents a pack from two cents. A competing Senate billwould increase the tax to five cents.</LP><TEXT>   Whatever the final amount, nearly everyone here expectsthe two chambers to agree on some increase before legislatorsemerge from their joint conference this week. And nearlyeveryone is astonished at the ease with which the measureseems to be sailing through.   It's not that anyone thinks the new levy will do much toswell the state's coffers. Each added penny on cigarettesgenerates only about $7 million a year.   And in an era when health concerns and budget woes havemade so-called &quot;sin taxes&quot; a revenue-raiser of first resort,even a five-cent increase would keep North Carolina's tobaccotax among the lowest in the nation.   But the prospect of any cigarette-tax increase is big newsin this state, where tobacco's political muscle is legendary.Tobacco here is a $7.5 billion industry, responsible for asmany as 281,000 jobs, according to the Tobacco Growers'Information Committee in Raleigh, a clearinghouse for tobaccofarmers.   In part, the impending tax increase reflects thepredicament of a state in such dire fiscal straits that it iswilling to heighten the tax burden on the industry thatprocesses its chief cash crop and is its largest employer.The state must raise as much as $700 million through newtaxes, and make major spending cuts to close this year'sbudget gap, the biggest since the Great Depression.   Regardless of their relatively paltry impact on thebudget, however, North Carolina political observers say thecigarette-tax proposals send an important signal that thestate's politicians no longer automatically heel to the callof tobacco interests. &quot;It's more of a philosophical changethan it is actual money,&quot; says state Rep. John McLaughlin.   One sign of such change is that many North Carolinialegislators are increasingly skeptical of tobacco-companylobbying tactics, particularly in the form of threats toleave the state. With the federal government and statesnationwide raising cigarette taxes, asks Rep. Peggy Stamey,&quot;are they going to move out of the country?&quot;   Tobacco-industry officials deny that the success of theNorth Carolina tax-increase proposals reflects anything otherthan the sense of fiscal crisis in the state. &quot;The NorthCarolina Legislature is somewhat frantically searching forany possible revenue option, even though it may be a smallone,&quot; says Walker Merryman, of the Tobacco Institute, anadvocacy organization for the industry.   Still, second-guessing the tobacco industry is hardlysecond nature to North Carolina politicians. Even a cent ortwo increase would be &quot;a feat of some magnitude,&quot; contendsJack Betts, editor of a journal on North Carolina stategovernment. &quot;In North Carolina, you don't generally commitpolitical suicide, and one way of doing that is to proposetobacco taxes,&quot; Mr. Betts says.   In states less dominated by tobacco, the politicallandscape has been more hospitable to cigarette-taxincreases, and many states have aggressively pursued them asrevenue options. Minnesota, for instance, has raised itscigarette tax by 25 cents, to 43 cents a pack, since 1985.Tobacco levies there and in other states have been soaggressive that many in the industry believe they are partlyto blame for declining consumption.   But even North Carolina's tax may soon begin inching itsway toward the national average -- now about 24 cents a pack.Political leaders here say the success of this year'sproposals opens the door to larger increases if the state'sbudget problems continue. Rep. Paul Luebke, a first-termlegislator and author of a book on North Carolina politics,says the promised increase is a &quot;breakthrough,&quot; that clearlyputs future tobacco-tax rises on the negotiating table.   &quot;I think it's a beginning,&quot; says Claudia Kadis, presidentof the North Carolina League of Women Voters, which haspushed for an increase closer to the national average. Themessage, Ms. Kadis adds, is that &quot;we have no more sacredcows.&quot;   But the tobacco industry has hardly given up the fight,and any future proposals to raise tobacco levies are certainto meet with stern resistance. The industry already isfretting about how other states will respond to new cigarettetaxes in the nation's premier tobacco-growing state. Says Mr.Merryman of the Tobacco Institute, higher taxes in NorthCarolina send a signal to other states &quot;that they canincrease their taxes with relative impunity.&quot;   And many North Carolinians, who still relish their state'shistorical ties to tobacco, don't want to see furtherincreases in the cigarette tax -- until now the lowest in thecountry. &quot;We've got a lot of last rankings in this state, andthat's the only one we're proud of,&quot; says Gene Causby,executive director of the North Carolina School BoardsAssociation.</TEXT></DOC>
