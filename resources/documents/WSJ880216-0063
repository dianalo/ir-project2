But Republicans Robert Dole and George Bush are locked in a bitterly close contest with critically important implications.    The choice of Mr. Dukakis is no surprise; as the popular governor of Massachusetts, he has been the overwhelming Democratic favorite here for nine months.    But Sen. Dole, riding the momentum of a strong victory in last week's Iowa caucuses, in eight days has drawn away substantial support from Vice President Bush, who has the backing of the state party establishment and whose lead here once seemed unassailable. Late surveys indicate a tight race with a slight tilt to the Kansas Republican.    Mr. Bush needs a victory here to move back into contention and to remain a credible candidate when the campaign moves South. &quot;Bush has got to win,&quot; says Eddie Mahe, a Republican strategist, &quot;if he's going to retain competitive stature with Bob Dole.&quot;    Another uncertainty here is the insurgent campaign of Pat Robertson, who scored a surprising second-place finish in Iowa. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who is also competing for conservative votes with Delaware's Pete du Pont, must defeat the former religious broadcaster.    &quot;Already you have candidates in a door-die situation in both parties,&quot; says Marc Nuttle, who directs the Robertson campaign. &quot;There's more money, staffers and powerful people calling in every chit they've got than anyone could have expected this early in the race.&quot;    As the campaign moved into its final hours in a state where opposition to taxes is a pre-requisite for election, both front-runners were the targets of attack on the tax issue. Over the weekend Mr. Bush began airing a television spot saying that Mr. Dole &quot;can't say no&quot; to taxes, adding: &quot;Bob Dole won't promise not to raise taxes, and you know what that means.&quot; Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri is airing an advertisement that proclaims Gov. Dukakis &quot;one of the biggest tax raisers in Massachusetts history.&quot;    Most of the attention on the Democratic side is on the size of the margin Mr. Dukakis will have and whether Rep. Gephardt or Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois will capture second place.    &quot;The character of the race changed dramatically the minute the Iowa caucuses ended,&quot; said David Moore, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire. &quot;Gephardt, who was nowhere, suddenly was second -- but all of a sudden the idea that he was going to run as an alternative to Dukakis was gone. He shouldn't have allowed this to be perceived as yet another race between him and Simon.&quot;    By all accounts, Messrs. Gephardt and Simon are running very close. Rep. Gephardt, the winner in Iowa, would probably survive a third-place finish. But for Sen. Simon, already $600,000 in debt, failure to finish second could mean failure to attract the contributions he needs to continue his campaign.    Mr. Dukakis, who won friends here with his fight against the Seabrook nuclear power plant just across the New Hampshire border, had a 2-to-1 lead over his nearest rival in final surveys of likely Democratic voters. He is so well known that ads running yesterday showed him without mentioning his name until the legally required tagline at the end of the spot.    While the others exchange increasingly bitter charges, Mr. Dukakis has remained serenely above the fray; in an appearance in Claremont yesterday he even declined to hew to a prepared text that would have criticized Rep. Gephart and Sen. Simon. In a debate at St. Anselm College, Sen. Albert Gore, who has husbanded his resources for the Southern primaries, defended Mr. Simon in an effort to diminish Mr. Gephardt, who is considered a bigger threat on Super Tuesday.    In his drive to stop the erosion of his support in the GOP race, Mr. Bush, whose campaign against Mr. Dole has included sharp criticism of Congress, gathered nearly three dozen members of Congress in a Nashua hotel to trumpet their endorsements. Yesterday the Bush campaign flew in former Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona -- a conservative icon who was defeated in this state in 1964 -- to repeat his endorsement of the vice president and to tape a television advertisement.    Mr. Bush's lieutenants acknowledge that the vice president hasn't been able to regain the offensive in the race here. &quot;The question is whether there's enough time to make a difference,&quot; says Ron Kaufman, a top Bush regional official. &quot;If we had two weeks it would be easier.&quot;    Mr. Bush is basing his hopes on a superior organization. &quot;In a dead heat the organization will make the difference,&quot; says William Cahill, the Bush spokesman here. &quot;There's no way they can build the kind of field organization in eight days we've built in all these months.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
