The action would follow President Bush's decision lastmonth to lift federal sanctions against South Africa.However, its unlikely that the reversal, if it occurs, willsignal the start of a stampede of investors back to thecountry.</LP><TEXT>   South Africa's segregationist racial policy has made itone of the ethical investing community's biggest targets.Since 1984, more than 200 institutions have renouncedinvestment in companies doing business there. Most of thepension funds, money managers and mutual funds that abandonedSouth African investments years ago say they are unpersuadedby the president's decision and the de Klerk governmentreforms. Unlike Oregon, they say they will keep their moneyfree of any association with South Africa.   &quot;We've seen some minor changes, but I don't think we'veseen nearly what we'll have to see . . . I will continue toexclude companies doing business in South Africa,&quot; says JohnHarrington, a money manager in the San Francisco Bay area whospecializes in socially responsible investing.   It's a different story in Oregon, where State TreasurerTony Meeker sought the legislative change that makes itpossible for state pension funds to reverse their investmentpolicy. A 1987 state law required Oregon's pension funds torid themselves before February 1992 of all investments incompanies doing business in South Africa. Since the Oregonlegislature meets only every other year, whatever policy wasin effect at the end of the 1991 session would remain inforce until 1993.   Mr. Meeker argued to the Oregon legislature earlier thisyear that the state's pension funds needed the flexibility toadapt to a changing political situation.   &quot;We advised the legislature there has been a tremendousamount of progress in South Africa,&quot; says Mr. Meeker. Oregonlegislators responded with a new law linking termination ofOregon's ban on investments to the end of federal sanctions,but gave Mr. Meeker discretion to veto the change. Mr. Meekersays he won't, adding that he has received just one letteropposing an end to divestiture.   The end of federal sanctions may have provided a cue forOregon, but not many others.   &quot;What people are waiting for is a clear constitutionalmove {in South Africa} for one man, one vote,&quot; says Mr.Harrington, the money manager.   In addition to the more than 200 institutional investorswith restrictions on South African investments, the InvestorResponsibility Research Center says 27 states, 88 cities and24 counties have restrictions against doing business with orinvesting in companies with South African connections. Aspokesman for the Washington, D.C., adviser on ethicalinvesting issues says the center isn't aware of anyinstitution -- aside from Oregon's pension funds -- planningto reverse its policy on South Africa.   Recent revelations of government participation in effortsto foment tribal violence among South Africa's black majorityhave given many investors cause for concern about just howmuch progress the country has made. Many say the decision toabandon South Africa as an ethical investing cause will hingeon evidence of true democratic reform.   &quot;South Africa needs to be on a path of irreversibleprogress toward universal suffrage and a non-racist,non-sexist democracy,&quot; says Robert Zevin, an economist andsenior vice president for U.S. Trust Co. in Boston. The moneymanager controls $800 million of South Africa-freeinvestments.   Far from inspiring a shift on South Africa, PresidentBush's decision to lift sanctions has engendered derision andscorn from some advocates of ethical investing.   &quot;I think the president is wrong,&quot; New York CityComptroller Elizabeth Holtzman was quoted as saying. Shevowed that New York City's $38 million in pension funds won'tsuspend their prohibitions against investing in South Africa.   If the president's actions failed to persuade the ethicalinvesting community, they may yet have an effect.   Some believe the end of federal sanctions is a signal tocompanies that South Africa's business climate is improving,and suggests the country is making political and socialprogress. With the prospect of fewer penalties and ultimatelyfewer taboos to doing business there, companies are bound tostart returning.   Currently, the Investor Responsibility Research Centerlists 104 U.S. companies with direct investments in SouthAfrica and 184 with non-equity relationships there. That's arelatively small group, and some worry that their investmentchoices will shrink as more companies renew ties with SouthAfrica.   Herbert Dyer, executive director of the Maryland StateRetirement System, says his state's $12.6 billion in pensionfunds already are restricted in their ability to make money.If more companies are added to the restricted list, he says,investment decisions will become that much more difficult.   Mr. Dyer says, &quot;We can't ignore the implications of thelifting of sanctions on our ability to invest.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
