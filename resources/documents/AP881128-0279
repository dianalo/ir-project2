The market fluctuated in a narrow range throughout the day. Itopened higher but then dropped back after the nation's biggest bankssaid they were increasing their prime interest rates to 10.5 percentfrom 10 percent.   The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rateto its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a halfpercentage point to 10 percent. Today's increase was the fourth inthe prime rate this year.   Hildegarde Zagorski, a market analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc., said the market had anticipated an increase in theprime, so the announcement did little damage on Wall Street.   Alfred Goldman, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St.Louis, called the session ``inconclusive,'' in part because ofseveral economic reports due out this week.   On Tuesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release itsrevised estimate of growth in the gross national product during thethird quarter.   Goldman also said the market's stagnation was due tocountervailing forces. Stocks have been oversold lately and theirprices should rise, but they are being held in check by negativefactors such as rising interest rates, he said.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
