Bruce Babbitt, declaring``I am free,'' today abandoned his faltering campaign for theDemocratic presidential nomination but vowed to carry on his fightfor ``the politics of truth.''   The first Democratic casualty of 1988, Babbitt said he was notready to endorse any of the six Democrats still in the race.   After finishing fifth in Iowa and sixth in New Hampshire,Babbitt's campaign for the Democratic nomination clearly had noplace to go.   At a news conference, the former governor, whose wit had drawnsympathetic coverage from the media said, drew laughter when hesaid people had told him, ``You fought a good fight, you were in itright up to the beginning.''   ``I don't know why we fared no better,'' he went on. ``I'llleave that for others to ponder.''   Looking back on his campaign, Babbitt said, ``I can't say Iloved every minute of it, but I loved most of it.''   He recalled the occasions during his campaign when he askedpeople to stand up if they supported his call for candor,especially his advocacy of a national sales tax to help reduce thefederal budget deficit.   ``I'll never forget the people in audience after audience whostood up out of their chair to join me in a demonstration of belieffor the politics of truth,'' he said.   ``I stood up for what I believed in,'' he added. ``They stood upfor me. That's what this last year has been about. Because acampaign is more than a candidate. A cause is more than a campaign.This candidate is withdrawing. This campaign is closing down. Butthe cause that it stood for has just begun.''   In answering reporters' questions, Babbitt displayed the wit andself-deprecating humor that characterized his campaign. Asked if hewould consider the vice-presidential spot, he replied, ``Youprobably ought to select a vice-presidential candidate from a statewith more than seven electoral votes.''   He added that if reincarnated he would try to be from theneighboring delegate-rich state of Texas.   Asked how the generally favorable press coverage he receivedaffected the race, Babbitt joked, ``You engaged in a deliberateconspiracy to destroy my candidacy by making me into kind of ahouse pet ... to destroy my credibility with the American people.''   Addressing his party, which has lost four of the last fivepresidential elections, Babbitt said, ``It is up to us to give ourcountry a compelling reason to elect us to power.''   ``I'm going to wait and watch and do everything I can to insurethe success of our party,'' he said.   The 48-year-old former Arizona governor spent Tuesday andWednesday consulting friends, supporters and family members abouthis decision, which he planned to announce at a news conferencetoday.   He said his two children urged him to ``stay in it as long asyou've got half a chance,'' while his wife Hattie contendedconversely that ``timing and grace are a big part of life andpolitics.''   ``There's a point at which you just don't emulate Harold Stassenforever,'' he added in reference to the perennial Republicanpresidential candidate from Minnesota.   Babbitt finished sixth out of a seven-man field on Tuesday inthe New Hampshire primary, garnering 5 percent of the vote. Onlyformer Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado received less.   Babbitt's campaign is broke and contributions ``slowed to atrickle'' after his fifth-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuseswhere he had staked virtually all of his resources, said campaignspokesman Vada Manager.   He said he would not endorse any of the other Democrats rightaway, although Jesse Jackson has already sought his support.   And Hart urged him to stay in the contest when the two spokeTuesday night, Babbitt said.   ``He said, `You've got something to say. You're a courageousguy. There's nothing shameful about losing.'''   Furthermore, Babbitt said Hart noted that the large number ofcandidate debates this year allows them to have a platform withoutspending a lot of money.   Babbitt is about $150,000 to $200,000 in debt, aides said.Manager said donations ``slowed to a trickle'' after Babbitt's poorshowing in Iowa.   But money was not the main problem, said Babbitt, noting in hisusual wry style, ``A lot of my friends are saying the money's neverbeen a problem. You never had any money, so why should you getexcited about not having any money now?''   Babbitt approached his campaign with a non-traditional stylefrom the beginning, turning to unusual outdoor attention-getterssuch as a bicycle ride across Iowa, an ascent of Mt. Washington inNew Hampshire, and a rugged cross-country ski tour in northernArizona.   He attracted favorable press reviews for his candor, his wit,and the depth of his economic proposals. Babbitt often poked fun athimself and his low standing in the polls with such quips as,``Nobody ever told me I was going to be a front-runner and so far Ihave fulfilled that expectation.''   He said his New Hampshire loss was not surprising after the Iowadefeat, but that he had hoped to get at least 10 percent of thevote.   Asked to explain what went wrong in his campaign, which helaunched last March 10, Babbitt said:   ``I would sum it up by saying this: When you have a newmessenger and a different and challenging message at the same time,it's a hard sell.''   Babbitt left open the possibility he might take another shot atthe presidency in 1992.   ``It was a great try and I don't regret a minute of it,'' hesaid. ``Who knows, maybe I'll ride back into town again.''</TEXT></DOC>
