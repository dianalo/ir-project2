PORNOGRAPHY   The court ruled that states may use anti-racketeering laws tofight pornography, but invoked free-speech rights to ban the statesfrom seizing before trial the contents of adult bookstores.   The justices said authorities unlawfully seized the contents of aFort Wayne, Ind., bookstore before any materials in the store werejudged obscene at a trial.   But by a 6-3 vote, the justices said prosecutors still may usethe state's anti-racketeering law to renew the obscenity case.   The cases are Fort Wayne Books vs. Indiana, 87-470, andSappenfield vs. Indiana, 87-614.      RELIGIOUS BOOKS      The court ruled that states may not give preferential treatmentto religious ublications by exempting them from sales taxes imposedon other books, newspapers and magazines.   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a now-defunct Texas statuteviolated the Constitution. The decision presumably will force thestate to give sales tax refunds to non-religious publications orimpose the levy against religious organizations that were exempt.   The case is Texas Monthly vs. Bullock, 87-1245.      SUMMARY TRIALS      The court let stand rulings that the public has no right toattend the so-called ``summary jury trials'' held in some legaldisputes.   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by newspapersin three Ohio cities that trial judges should be barred fromconducting such proceedings in secret.   The newspapers' lawyers had asked the high court to rule, for thefirst time, that the Constitution provides a public right of accessto judicial proceedings in civil, or non-criminal, cases.   The case is Cincinnati Post vs. GE, 88-813.      EVANGELISTS      Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart failed in his bid to kill a$90 million lawsuit by a defrocked evangelist who Swaggart accusedof adultery in 1986.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that MarvinGorman's suit against Swaggart and others unconstitutionallyentangles Louisiana state courts in matters of church doctrine anddiscipline.   The cases are Swaggart vs. Adler, 88-1080, and Treeby vs. Gorman,88-1058.      FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION      The court refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of aHollywood movie producer who hired actors to peform sex acts in apornographic film.   The justices, without comment, let stand a California SupremeCourt ruling that Harold Freeman's conviction on charges ofprocuring people for purposes of prostitution violated his freedomof expression.   The cases are California vs. Freeman, 88-1054, and Applegate vs.Freeman, 88-1050.      ABORTION      The court allowed Kentucky to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion lawthat included provisions for parental notification.   The justices, without comment, turned down an emergency requestby ``pro-choice'' advocates seeking to block the law until a federalappeals court rules on its constitutionality.   The case is Eubanks vs. Wilkinson, A-582.      IRAN ASSETS      The court agreed to referee a dispute between the U.S. governmentand American businesses stemming from the 1981 settlement of theIran hostage crisis.   The court said it will review a ruling that businesses recoveringmoney from Iran's government do not have to pay a portion of it tothe U.S. government.   The case is U.S. vs. Sperry Corp., 88-952.      FREEDOM OF INFORMATION      While agreeing to keep the identities of the legal combatants asecret, the court voted to resolve a significant dispute over theFreedom of Information Act.   The justices said they will decide whether a government lawenforcement agency must surrender to a government contractor beinginvestigated for possible fraud certain documents received fromanother agency.   Much of the case is cloaked in secrecy _ including the identityof the contractor and the government agencies involved _ presumablyto protect the contractor's reputation.   The case is John Doe Agency vs. John Doe Corp., 88-1083.      ANIMAL DRUGS      The court allowed the Food and Drug Administration to imposestrict controls on the use of drugs by veterinarians for``experimental'' treatment of some animal diseases.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by an Illinoisdrug distributing company that the government wrongly is interferingwith treatment of serious animal illnesses. The FDA seized a largequantity of drugs July 9, 1986, from Schuyler Laboratories Inc. inRushville, Ill.   The case is 9@1 KG Containers vs. U.S., 88-614.</TEXT></DOC>
