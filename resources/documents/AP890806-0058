State television said the situation in the transport industryremained uncertain.   Rail workers staged a one-hour strike Saturday in Silesia thatidled about 80 passenger and freight trains.   The workers have threatened a general rail strike if theirdemand for basic pay of $96 per month is not met. The pay now isabout $60 a month.   A meeting between the official OPZZ trade union, the independentSolidarity union and transport officials is to be held Monday todiscuss demands by bus and rail workers, the official PAP newsagency said.   State television said the postal workers in Legnica signed anagreement with management Sunday, but it gave no details.   A strike at a tire factory in the city of Grudziaz in northernPoland continued and PAP said the workers' pay demands exceeded thefactory's financial reserves.   Also reported were strikes by health workers in the city ofLowicz and by tram-car operators in Walbrzych.   Strikes are becoming frequent as workers demand pay increases tocope with inflation that is expected to exceed 120 percent thisyear.   Some strikes are supported by the official trade union, some bySolidarity and others by both unions.   Over the weekend, several Solidarity activists from Warsaw wentto the provinces to meet with strikers and explain the independentunion's policies in Parliament toward labor disputes.   Solidarity leaders have said the union recognizes the reasonsfor the strikes but time is needed for reforms to be put into place.</TEXT></DOC>
