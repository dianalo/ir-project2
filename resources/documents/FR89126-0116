JTPA section106 requires the Secretary of Labor to formulate performance standardsapplicable to grantees designated to operate these Section 401 programs.JTPA section 401(h)(2) further specifies that ``Recipients of funds underthis section shall establish performance goals, which shall, to the extentrequired by the Secretary, comply with performance standards establishedby the Secretary pursuant to section 106''. Department of Labor (DOL) regulationsat 20 CFR 632.11(d) identify performance standards as one of fourteen responsibilitytests that INA grantees must meet for redesignation. This notice sets forththe performance standards for JTPA section 401 INA programs beginning withProgram Year (PY) 1989 (July 1, 1989_June 30, 1990).<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In accordance with legal requirements referenced above, performance standardshave been in use for INA grantees since 1983 through each of the programperiods up to the present.1. <T3>Required Performance Measures. </T3>In consultation with grantee representatives,the Department has established and utilized three required performancemeasures as follows:andbullet; <T3>Entered Employment Rate </T3>(EER)_the percentage of total termineesplaced in unsubsidized employment.andbullet; <T3>Positive Termination Rate </T3>(PTR)_the percentage of total termineeswho entered unsubsidized employment plus those achieving certain otheroutcomes including return to full-time school, completion of a major levelof education, or successful completion of other planned participant activity.andbullet; <T3>Cost per Positive Termination </T3>(CPT)_total positive terminationsdivided into total training funds (minus administrative costs and communitybenefit costs).The EER measure reflects the employment orientation of all JTPA programs.The PTR measure recognizes that many INA program participants live in areaswith severely depressed economies and limited opportunities for employment.Thus, besides helping participants find employment immediately after termination,another important goal for INA programs is to enhance longer term employabilityby assisting them to return to school or participate in other trainingor planned activities. The CPT measure emphasizes that funds must be usedcost effectively. A fourth measure available to grantees on an <T3>optional </T3>basis is the Community Benefit project (CB). These projectsare monitored separately by the Department. Participants and costs involvedin Community Benefit Projects are excluded in calculating grantee performanceon the three required measures (EER, PTR, CPT).2. <T3>Previous ``Past Performance'' Method for Setting Grantee Standards.</T3>Prior to PY 1987, the method used to set individual grantee standardswas to take the grantee's performance level on the given measure in a previousyear and apply that fixed number in advance as the minimum standard forthe upcoming program period. This meant that grantees were locked intostandards based on the previous year's performance without taking intoaccount changes occuring in clientele served and other local conditionsaffecting outcomes achieved. Grantees who performed at high levels in theprevious year were held to high standards even though their conditionsmay have changed. Accordingly, a number of INA grantees ended up unableto meet such standards because their performance did not match the prioryear's higher levels. Conversely, those grantees who had performed at lowerlevels in previous years had much easier standards with little incentiveto improve from one year to the next. This old approach was used duringTransition Year 1984 and through Program Years 1984, 1985 and 1986.<T3>3. Development and Adoption of Model-Based Approach. </T3>From theinception of performance standards, the Department's aim has been to establisha uniform and objective method for setting individual grantee standardsso as to reflect each grantee's performance results in relation to itsclientele characteristics and to certain local conditions for its own servicearea. The statistical technique known as multiple regression analysis isthe technical procedure through which such a modeling approach can be developedand applied. This same technique has been and is the basic method usedto develop and update performance standards for the mainline JTPA TitleIIA programs operated by the States and local service delivery areas. Thissame approach is also being used to set standards for other JTPA employmentand training programs such as Job Corps centers and the JTPA Section 402Farmworker program grantees.Over a period of several years (PY 1984-85-86) this type of approach wasunder development for INA programs including periodic consultation withgrantee representatives. PY 1987 was the first year in which statisticalmodels were adopted and implemented successfully for the three requiredINA performance measures. Essentially the same models with some minor changesare presently in use for the current PY 1988 period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Basic Modeling Approach</ITAG>Beginning with PY 1987, performance standards for INA program granteeshave been set through the use of multivariate adjustment models developedfor each of the three required performance measures (EER, PTR, CPT). Thismodeling approach examines the statistical relationships (via multipleregression analysis) between program outcomes, terminee characteristics,and local economic conditions in order to identify the important factorswhich influence each performance measure. Some factors are found to beassociated with better performance and other factors are related to weakerperformance. Models are then developed that quantify the relationshipsbetween the various factors so that specific adjustments can be calculatedfor each grantee on an individualized basis. Adding up the net effect ofall factors in the model for each performance measure (EER, PTR, CPT) provideseach grantee with its own individually adjusted performance standards.As an example of how adjustments work for factors included in the models,take the case of various educational levels among the terminees in a grantee'sprogram. If the grantee serves a higher proportion of school dropouts,then the entered employment rate proves to be lower on the average andthe model yields somewhat easier standards for that grantee. On the otherhand, if a grantee's program serves a higher proportion of high schoolgraduates, then the model produces somewhat higher entered employment ratestandards. In summary, the adjustment model approach offers these advantages:andbullet; It allows allows standards to be set consistently and equitablyfor all grantees by accounting for a variety of factors affecting performance.andbullet; It reduces inducements for concentrating on easier to serve participantssince grantees who may practice ``creaming'' will be held to stricter performancestandards. andbullet; It provides grantees with a useful tool in the planning processby projecting performance targets based on their own unique terminee characteristicsand local conditions. andbullet; It involves no disincentives for superior performance since granteescan be rated as superior performers in one year without making their standardsmore stringent in the subsequent year. In addition to the above considerations, the model-based standard settingprocess provides INA grantees and the Department of Labor with objectivecriteria for assessing program performance on several key outcomes. Thus,well-managed programs should do better than the models predict while poorlymanaged programs can be expected to do worse. <ITAG tagnum="84">Selection of Modeling Factors</ITAG>The following criteria have been used to determine which factors are includedin the models.andbullet; Management practices have been excluded because they are regardedas within control of program managers, not beyond their control. andbullet; There must be some variations among grantees on the factor. andbullet; The relationship between the factor and the performance measuremakes intuitive sense. andbullet; The factor is strongly related to the performance outcome. andbullet; The factor is objective and easily quantifiable.andbullet; For local economic conditions, published sub-state level datais available nationwide. Factors appearing in the models use three main types of data includingterminee characteristics, program characteristics, and service area characteristics(local economic conditions). For the PY 1989 models, data has been usedfrom the Indian Annual Status Reports (ASRs) submitted by grantees forProgram Years 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. These reports contain informationfrom each grantee on outcomes achieved, services received by terminees,terminee characteristics and related fiscal data. Data for local economicfactors have been drawn from reports published by the Bureau of the Censusand the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The following 14 factors have been selected for inclusion in one or moreof the three models for the INA performance measures in PY 1989: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,b2,tp0,p6,6/7,i1,21,2X2,2X2,2X2</C> <H1>Local factors</H1><H1>Models</H1><H2>EER</H2><H2>PTR</H2><H2>CPT</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent females<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent aged 14 to 21<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent school dropouts<D>X</D><D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent students<D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent welfare recipients<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent long-term unemployed<D>X</D><D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent not in labor force<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Average weeks participated<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tribal Government status<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent employment in manufacturing<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent employment in farm, forestry, and fisheries<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Average earnings in trade industry<D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Local area unemployment rate (BLS/LAUS)<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent families with income below the poverty level<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Of the 14 factors listed in the table above, 13 of them have beenused in the previous models for PY 1987 and/or PY 1988. The one factorbeing introduced for the first time in these PY 1989 models is the LocalArea Unemployment Rate (LAUS) that is being added to the EER model as discussedbelow. Although a number of other possible factors were examined in developingthese PY 1989 models, the factors shown above proved to be the ones thatmake the largest contribution to the model's predictive ability. Also,retention of these factors in the PY 1989 models make them broadly consistentwith the corresponding models for the given measures in PY 1987 and PY1988. Certain other changes in the particular models for PY 1989 are reviewedbelow.Entered Employment Rate (EER) ModelThe PY 1989 model for the EER measure contains a total of 11 factors, 10of which appeared in the PY 1988 EER model. Among the factors retainedare six terminee characteristics (Aged 14-21, School dropouts, Students,Welfare recipients, Long-term unemployed, and Not in the labor force).Three service area characteristics are also carried over from the previousPY 1988 EER model and these are Employment in manufacturing; Employmentin farm, forestry, and fisheries; and Average earnings in the trade industry.<T3>Tribal Government status continues to appear in the PY 1989 modelsfor all three performance measures just as it did in all three models forPY 1987 and PY 1988. </T3>This factor recognizes that reservation grantees(i.e., those tribal groups having a recognized Government-to-Governmentrelationship as defined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs) can be expectedto face more serious barriers that can hamper performance on each of therequired measures.Two factors that appear in the PY 1988 EER model are being deleted fromthe PY 1989 model for this measure. One is ``Percent of Population Livingin Urban Areas'' which was put into the PY 1988 model to distinguish betweengrantees located in more urbanized or more rural areas. However, this urbanpopulation variable makes an inconsequential contribution to the PY 1989model and is therefore being dropped.The other factor being deleted is the INA unemployment rate which was addedto the PY 1988 EER model by the Department in response to grantees' concernsabout severe unemployment in a number of areas. In the absence of any otherappropriate data source, local data for this factor was calculated throughan ad hoc approach of combining Indian unemployment data from the 1980Census with current area unemployment statistics. This, however, led toapparent discrepancies for some grantees and raised questions as to datareliability.Therefore, this factor will be discontinued pending availability of anacceptable nationwide data source based on standard definitions and uniformcollection methods. A new factor to be added to the PY 1989 EER model isthe Local Area Unemployment Rate (LAUS). Examination of this variable disclosesthat it is the best existing indicator of relative job opportunities availablewithin the local labor market areas served by INA grantees. Local datafor this factor will be drawn from the current local area unemploymentstatistics compiled regularly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a nationwidebasis. This factor is expected to reflect changes in unemployment levelsand local economic trends that may occur from one year to the next withinthe grantees' service areas.Positive Termination Rate (PTR) ModelAs shown in the preceding table, the PY 1989 PTR model will contain fivefactors which include Aged 14-21; School Dropouts; Long-term Unemployed;Employed in Farm, Forestry, and Fisheries; and Tribal Government Status.All five of these factors appeared in the PY 1988 PTR model. However, twofactors that were in the PY 1988 PTR models are being dropped. One of theseis the ``Percent students'' which is being omitted because its statisticalinfluence is insignificant in the modeling process. The other factor beingdropped is ``Percent not in Labor Force'' which the data shows as beingopposite to its expected effect (i.e., PY 1988 PTR model showed termineesnot in labor force as being slightly <T3>harder</T3> to achieve a positive termination; PY 1989 modeling datashowed such terminees as being slightly <T3>easier</T3> to obtain a positive termination).Cost per Positive Termination (CPT) ModelThe PY 1989 model for the CPT contains eight factors each of which werealso included in the PY 1988 CPT model. Among these are the three termineecharacteristics: Females, Aged 14-21, and Students. Two program characteristicsare also retained and these are the Average Weeks Participated and TribalGovernment Status. The other remaining factors in the CPT model are thethree local economic conditions which are Percent employment in farm, forestry,and fisheries; Average earnings in the trade industry; and Percent of familieswith incomes below the poverty level.Two terminee characteristics included in the previous PY 1988 CPT modelhave been dropped because both factors (i.e., Percent of terminees whoare long-term unemployed and Percent of terminees not in the labor force)no longer operate in the expected manner (i.e., somewhat more expensiveto serve). Instead, based on the total program data analyzed, termineeswith these characteristics are shown as being slightly less expensive toserve which appears counter-intuitive; therefore, these previous factorshave been deleted from the PY 1989 CPT model.Additional Modeling ResultsIn developing the models for PY 1989, special attention has been givento re-examining the question of whether program activity factors (``programmix'') ought to be included. Previously, for the PY 1987 and PY 1988 standards,the Department's position has been that program mix is a matter that fallswithin management control and, hence, should be left out of the models.However, some grantees have expressed concern that performance standardsdiscourage the use of Classroom Training because it is more expensive eventhough needed and appropriate for a number of INA participants.In consideration of such concerns, the model building process for PY 1989specifically addressed the question of how program activity factors wouldoperate if they were added to the models. Based on program data reportedby all grantees over the last several years, the average distribution ofINA participants by program activity levels is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,b2,tp0,i1,s20,4,4,4</C> <ITAG tagnum="96">[In percent]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Program year_</H1><H2>1984 </H2><H2>1985 </H2><H2>1986</H2>Percent of participants in:<ITAG tagnum="3">Classroom Training </ITAG><D>44.5 </D><D>44.0 </D><D>44.2</D><ITAG tagnum="3">On-the-Job Training </ITAG><D>12.2 </D><D>13.1 </D><D>14.4</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Tryout Employment </ITAG><D>1.3 </D><D>.5 </D><D>.7</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Work Experience </ITAG><D>33.5 </D><D>34.1 </D><D>32.7</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Community Service Employment </ITAG><D>8.6 </D><D>8.4 </D><D>8.0</D></ITAG>The above data shows substantially the same pattern over the three programyears except for the trend toward increased use of On-the-Job Training.The detailed data analysis completed as part of the modeling process showsthat, of the five program activities, On-the-Job Training is the most effectiveand cost efficient method of placing INA terminees in unsubsidized employment.Contrary to some expectations, Classroom Training turns out to be the nextmost effective and cost efficient approach to preparing terminees for unsubsidizedjobs. Work Experience and Community Service Employment prove to be theleast effective and most costly activities.What this means in terms of including program mix in the models is thatthose grantees using higher proportions of On-the-Job Training and/or ClassroomTraining would end up getting more stringent performance standard (i.e.,higher EERs and lower CPTs). This would be the opposite of the desiredand expected results; therefore, to include program mix in the models,would likely lead to <T3>discouraging </T3>rather than encouraging greater use of ClassroomTraining in contrast to more expensive and less effective use of Work Experienceand Community Service Employment.In light of these results, and since a choice of program activity continuesto be a key management decision, the Department sees little reason to includeprogram mix in the models. In fact, inclusion of program mix in the modelsbased on the above results might become a negative influence leading tolesser use of Classroom Training.Departure PointsThe models described above describe how performance standards can be adjustedfor each grantee to reflect characteristics of terminees served and ofthe local economy. As part of the modeling process, it is also necessaryto establish an overall level of performance around which adjustments aremade for the various factors included in each model. These overall levelsare referred to as departure points. The departure points for each measureare based on the national average performance levels compiled for all granteesduring a given period. In the case of the PY 1987 and PY 1988 models, thisperiod has been <T3>one program year</T3> from which data was most recently available.However, further analysis has shown that using only one program year asthe period for determining the departure points can lead to problems ifthere are significant shifts up or down in the national averages from oneparticular year to the next. In order to moderate this possible situation,the departure points for the PY 1989 models will be based instead on nationalaverages over the most recent <T3>three program years </T3>for which data is available. This practicehas the desired effect of avoiding or minimizing abrupt shifts in departurepoints for the models from year to year.End of Transition PeriodAt the time the new model-based process was introduced, the Departmentestablished a two year transition timeframe (PY 1987 and PY 1988) duringwhich grantees' standards would be calculated partially by model adjustmentsand partially by a past performance weight for each measure. The purposewas to provide a way of accommodating for changes involved in moving fromthe old past performance approach for setting grantee standards to thenew adjustment model methodology. For PY 1987, the weights for past performanceranged from 31% for the CPT and 34% for the PTR to 44% to the EER. ForPY 1988, the past performance weights were reduced to 25% on each measurethereby raising the model adjustment weights to 75%. <T3>For PY 1989, the models will no longer include a past performance weightsince the transition phase is over.</T3>Acceptable Performance RangesThe adjustment models and departure points described above are used toset performance goals individually for each INA grantee. Following procedurespreviously established for PY 1987 and PY 1988, a range of acceptable performancewill be calculated around the performance goal for each measure in thePY 1989 modeling calculations consisting of three levels:andbullet; A <T3>recommended performance goal</T3> that reflects the adjustments forterminee characteristics and other local factors for the particular grantee.andbullet; An <T3>exemplary performance level</T3> above the goal. andbullet; A <T3>Minimally acceptable level</T3> below the goal which represents theminimum performance the grantee should meet.The size of ranges between minimum, goal, and exemplary levels depend uponthe relative size of the grantees' program. Smaller grantees have widerperformance ranges than larger grantees, reflecting the fact that statisticscan fluctuate more substantially when there are fewer numbers of participantsbeing served.By using these ranges of acceptable performance, rather than a single level,the performance standards can acknowledge that there are other factorsaffecting performance that are not captured by the models and that maybe outside management control.<ITAG tagnum="84">Experience With the PY 1987 Models</ITAG>There has been a continuing pattern of improved performance among INA granteeson each of the three measures over the last several program years. Thissame pattern continued in PY 1987 which marked completion of the firstprogram year in which model-based standards have been used to assess granteeperformance. For information purposes, the following data display the relativeproportions of INA grantees achieving the various levels of final resultsfor PY 1987.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,b2,tp0,i1,s20,5,5,5</C> <ITAG tagnum="96">[In percent]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>EER</H1><H1>PTR</H1><H1>CPT</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Exemplary<D>26.5</D><D>31.5</D><D>38.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Goal level<D>38.7</D><D>44.2</D><D>47.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum standard<D>39.4</D><D>21.0</D><D>13.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Below minimum<D>4.4</D><D>3.3</D><D>.5</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Percent of total of all grantees</ITAG><D>100.0</D><D>100.0</D><D>100.0</D></ITAG>As can be noted, the proportions of grantees achieving the better performanceratings is relatively high and tends to exceed by some margin the expecteddistribution of grantees which is about 15 percent exemplary, about 15percent below minimum and the remainder above the minimum and/or goal levels.Thus, the model-generated levels did not impose overly stringent performancestandards on the INA grantees during PY 1987. In fact, the number of granteesmissing their standards was significantly less in PY 1987 under the modelingapproach than under the old past performance method used in PY 1984, PY1985, and PY 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">PY 1989 Planning Instructions</ITAG>The Department expects to provide performance standards worksheets basedon the models described herein so that grantees can use the projected levelsin their planning estimates for PY 1989. As previously indicated, planninginstructions will furnish guidance to grantees on the specific provisionsoutlined in this notice together with any further changes that may be adoptedfor PY 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC this 30th day of December 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Roberts T.
