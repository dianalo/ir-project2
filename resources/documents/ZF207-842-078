 The system is easy touse and update and has been customized to meet the specific needsof individual prisons.andP;  The system can be used to print a recentpicture of an escaped prisoner or transmit it directly to themedia and law enforcement agencies.andP;  It also prints outidentification cards.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   PC Album (computer graphics software) (usage)Microsoft C (Compiler) (usage).andO;Topic:     Correctional InstitutionsData BasesEmployeeCase Study.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Behind BarsandM;Breakout!andP;  Sirens sound.andP;  A prisoner escapes.andP;  Within minutes, a prisonofficial boots up a computer.andP;  He calls up the computerized prisonidentification system and prints a recent picture of the escaped prisoner.andO;That picture immediately goes out to local police stations and the media.andP;  Atthe same time, he transmits the image to local sheriffs equipped to acceptit.andP;  The transmissions take 15 seconds at 9600 baud.andP;  Within an hour, allarea police have a full description and picture of the escaped prisoner.andM;That was the dream of the New York State prison system.andP;  The implementationwas the brainchild of Gene Lemme.andM;Last November, Lemme received a letter from New York state prison officials.andO;They were taking bids for a computerized system to track data and pictures ofprisoners and prison personnel.andP;  Specifications were enclosed.andP;  The systemneeded to print out color pictures of the prisoners and different coloredI.D.andP;  badges with the image and text.andP;  The system also needed to be able tostore, edit, and quickly search the file.andM;Their old system was outdated and expensive to maintain.andP;  In order to keeppictures of the prisoners current (and deal with new prisoners), they neededto maintain a photographic lab with a qualified staff to develop the film.andO;They also had to manually file it.andP;  They also had to manually look up andcross-reference data.andP;  But, in a prison system, time is critical.andP;  During adisturbance, each minute could mean the difference between life and death.andO;Immediate information about everyone involved could be critical toresolution.andM;Lemme had to be aware of the special needs of the prison system.andP;  He came upwith the concept of TV/*--the Text and Video Storage, Transmission, andReproduction System.andP;  Using his background in computer graphics (bothhardware and software consulting and sales), he was able to build the systemat a reasonable price.andM;The most critical decision was the choice of software.andP;  Lemme decided to usePC Album and made his bid based on ts capabilities.andP;  PC Album offers powerfulimage and text storage facilities.andP;  It comes with many printer drivers, andit's a stand-alone product that integrates image storage with databasemanagement capabilities (many similar products require a database managementsystem in addition to the image processing product).andM;In January, Lemme heard from New York state officials.andP;  His was the low bidof the group--at half the price of the highest bidder.andP;  The officials werepleased and surprised.andP;  They expected all the bids to be about the same.andO;Lemme's bid was $250,000 under the high bid.andM;Next came a series of meetings with New York State prison officials.andP;  Theirprimary concern was to ensure that the bid included everything in thespecifications.andP;  Within an hour Lemme had gained their full confidence.andO;Using PC Album, he developed a working prototype of the system--without usingPC Album's built in programming applications language (PAL).andP;  In the meetingsthat followed, they refined the existing specification; within two months theNew York State Prison System had their first version.andM;The product was built using the first prototype created with PC Album.andP;  Lemmetook full advantage of PC Album's PAL to implement some of the features.andO;Since PC Album is continually undergoing development, Lemme worked closelywith them to help solve system needs.andP;  For example, the system needed I.D.andO;cards in five colors, based on whether the I.D.andP;  belonged to an inmate,prison employee, or another person in the prison.andP;  Inmates could have greenor gray I.D.andP;  cards, depending on their privilege level.andM;The version of PC Album Lemme was working with couldn't readily change thebackground colors on images, but that was on the list of future enhancements.andO;Lemme shared his project needs with the PC Album developers, and theyenthusiastically accommodated him.andP;  They made his program modification a highpriority.andP;  Lemme was soon able to program the system using PC Album's PAL toprint out I.D.andP;  cards with the appropriate background.andP;  The system also hasthe flexibility to easily change a person's picture or status.andM;The development went smoothly--with few roadblocks.andP;  One hardware problem wasboards that overheated.andP;  He selected a sophisticated hardware set-up loadedwith accessory boards.andP;  When the boards overheated, Lemme used his backgroundin hardware to install additional fans and a new power supply.andM;One of the prerequisites of the system was that it be easy to use.andP;  Lemmeneeded to develop a system that prison personnel without computer experiencecould learn quickly.andP;  He created a series of menus with all the functionsusers would need.andP;  The entire process is based on a two-layer menu system.andO;Most users could learn the system in two two-hour training sessions.andM;Another predominant software issue was creating a back-up facility fromwithin the program.andP;  Although PC Album has the ability to back-up onto disk,there aren't built-in facilities for tape back-ups.andP;  Disk back-up was out ofthe question, since the system had a 80M hard drive.andP;  Lemme had to find a wayto call a tape back-up routine from within PC Album.andP;  He worked closely withthe PC Manager staff, and together they found a way to incorporate a Croutine he'd written for this function.andM;From a development standpoint, the project was not as clear cut as it firstseemed.andP;  The prison authorities didn't coordinate their project with theindividual prisons.andP;  As it turned out, each prison had special needs, likedifferent I.D.andP;  card color schemes.andP;  Lemme had to go back into his systemtime and again to add features to accommodate individual needs.andM;As a result, the final product was much more rugged than the one Lemme setout to build.andP;  The application started out being specific to a particularprison facility and developed into a package flexible enough to be used inmany different situations.andM;Now Lemme has only one regret about the development effort.andP;  He wishes he'ddone a more in-depth analysis of his client's needs.andP;  There would have beenfewer surprises, and he would have had a much better grasp of the product hewas aiming for.andP;  But the experience he gained created the ground work for newprojects.andP;  He's currently working on Real Estate TV/*, Catalog TV/*, andMedical TV/*.andP;  Their development promises to be considerably easier.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
