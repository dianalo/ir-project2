SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of Americans changing residencesdipped after the 1984-85 burst of home sales triggered by fallinginterest rates, the Census Bureau says.   Some 3 million fewer Americans moved between 1985-86 than in theprevious year, with virtually all of the drop occuring in thecategory of moves within the same county, according to thegeographical mobility report released Tuesday by the bureau.   Lower interest rates unleashed a pent-up demand for new homes inthe 1984-85 year, spurring the mobility rate to 20.2 percent,highest in this decade, said Kristin A. Hansen, an analyst in thebureau's Population Division.   But in 1985-86 the rate of movement slipped back to 18.6percent, a decline, but still the second highest rate in the 1980s,she said.   The figures are the most recent detailed statistics on mobilityavailable. However, data collected by the departments of Commerceand Housing and Urban Development indicate that continued lowinterest rates helped spur strong sales of both new and existinghomes last year.   Mobility rates fell to all-time lows early in this decade, Ms.Hansen said, as people postponed their quests for better homesbecause of high interest rates.   The mobility low of 16.6 percent of Americans age 1 and over wasachieved in 1982-83, Census figures show. The level was about 20percent throughout the 1950s and 1960s.   Mobility statistics were first recorded in 1948, when it wasfound that 19.9 percent of Americans had moved in the previous year.   In the 1970s, Ms. Hansen explained, rates of moving declinedbecause of the decline in the size of families. People no longerneeded to seek larger homes to accommodate more people, shecommented.   Also, there was a slight increase in homeownership in thatperiod, and owners are less likely to relocate than renters.   In the 1985-86 year the main change was in the number ofresidents who oved within the same county, 13.1 percent compared to11.3 percent a year earlier.   ``Local reasons for moving are usually housing-related orchanges in life cycles'' she said, such as children moving to theirown homes, getting married and so forth.   Regionally, the Northeast continued to lose people to otherregions, with a net loss of 250,000 movers, while the Westcontinued to gain, receiving about 200,000.   The Midwest reversed its recent pattern of loss, however,gaining about 15,000 interstate movers in the year, while theinflux to the South was down to only 35,000 new residents.   Ms. Hansen speculated that this is a result of the recentproblems in the energy industry in such southern states as Texasand Louisiana, which are no longer attracting workers from theMidwest. Indeed, many who moved there to work in oil fields may beheading back home, she said.   By age, the rate of movement is highest among young adults anddeclines with age, Ms. Hansen observed. And by race, blacks tend tomove more than whites.   While many factors are at work, mobility generally declines asincome increases. Those with less money are more likely to berenters, while higher income people tend to own homes and may betied to an area by business and professional relationships.   Here is a rundown of the overall share of Americans aged 1 andover who moved over one-year periods.</TEXT><TEXT>   Year     Rate1985-86  18.61984-85  20.21983-84  17.21982-83  16.61981-82  17.01980-81  17.21970-71  17.91960-61  20.01950-51  20.9</TEXT></DOC>
