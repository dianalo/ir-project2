The son of a wealthy Texas landowner, he made millions of his own in the insurance industry before winning election to the Senate in 1970. There, he quickly established himself as one of his party's pre-eminent fund-raisers before being tapped yesterday by Michael Dukakis to be the Democratic vice presidential nominee.    Mr. Dukakis rides the subway in Boston, grows tomatoes in his front yard, and refuses to accept contributions from political action committees. Mr. Bentsen pays for a personal driver, hunts quail with the corporate elite, and raised $1.5 million from PACs alone in the first 15 months after he became Senate Finance Committee chairman in January 1987. Asked recently about his meetings with Mr. Dukakis, the Texan said, &quot;He's been in my office a couple of times.&quot;    Mr. Bentsen's own presidential campaign in 1976 ended in frustration, and after being passed over by Walter Mondale for the vice presidential nomination four years ago, he kept his emotions carefully guarded in his dealings this year. &quot;Bentsen is very sensitive to not making a fool of himself,&quot; a Texas confidant said during the talks with the Dukakis campaign.    It was only yesterday morning, when Mr. Bentsen was walking to the plane that would take him to Boston and Gov. Dukakis's news conference, that he let his emotions show, punching the air with his fist and declaring: &quot;I feel great.&quot;    Mr. Bentsen brings with him a pro-business, relatively conservative voting record that mixes fiscal austerity with more moderate views on questions of civil rights and social issues such as abortion. As a young congressman, he was an early opponent of the poll tax, and though his attacks on former Texas Sen. Ralph Yarborough in their bitter 1970 primary fight angered liberals, he sidestepped efforts to make race an issue in the campaign.    Under President Reagan, he backed both the administration's early budget and tax cuts. And though supportive of tax overhaul in 1986, he sought first to use his political strength to protect oil and real-estate interests. He has supported a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, deficit-reduction targets set by the Gramm-Rudman law, and an oil-import fee to raise federal revenue and help the petroleum industry at home.    In the same period, Mr. Bentsen backed support for anti-government forces in Angola and military assistance to the Nicaraguan insurgents. In a closed-door session of the Senate in 1983, he gave an emotional speech in support of the president's Nicaragua policy that angered liberals. But Sen. Bentsen's fluency in Spanish -- he and Mr. Dukakis speak the language, which may prove important in electorally vital Texas and California -- and knowledge of the region commands respect.    Though Mr. Bentsen backed President Reagan's early defense increases, he has become part of a coalition of Southern senators who have challenged the administration in recent years on national-security questions. He backed deep reductions in President Reagan's request for the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1986, and while he supported Mr. Reagan that year on an arms sale to Saudi Arabia, he joined in overriding the veto of legislation imposing sanctions on South Africa.    A former chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Bentsen took over the Senate Finance panel when Democrats recaptured the chamber two years ago, and has been a key middleman between the administration and the more liberal House. His committee approved a more stringent welfare reform bill than the House version, and he ushered trade legislation through a House-Senate conference only after removing major protectionist provisions.    As the party's vice presidential nominee, Mr. Bentsen may become a more ardent champion of these same issues.    Though his own presidential campaign went nowhere, Mr. Bentsen has since proven himself as an organizer for Democrats in the Senate and particularly Texas. &quot;He'd be a help setting up the organization that would let the ticket crack the Bush-solid South,&quot; says Democratic political strategist Bill Hamilton.    &quot;Bentsen does not help Dukakis in California,&quot; insists GOP pollster Richard Wirthlin. Yet, one of those who was early to promote the Texan was Mr. Dukakis's California co-chairman, Rep. Norman Mineta. A chance encounter in the late 1970s brought Mr. Mineta and Mr. Bentsen together, and when Dukakis adviser Paul Brountas solicited recommendations from Mr. Mineta, the Californian cited Mr. Bentsen as a southern conservative who might run well in high-tech areas of his state.    Mr. Bentsen's courtly manner belies a tougher, competitive side. He runs his office like a mini-corporation, requiring written papers from his staff on issues, and though he thinks at great length in answering public questions, in private he can be direct, piercing, and occasionally profane. Within the Finance Committee, he has avoided bickering, adopting a cautious bipartisan tone allies admire but critics say is often sanctimonious and programmed.    Sen. Bentsen's personal wealth includes a Virginia farm and extensive ranchland in southern Texas, where his family owns a private game preserve. Much of his wealth is in a blind trust, and he has scattered holdings outside in real estate, limited partnerships and mineral deeds. His wife, Beryl, is listed in federal disclosure forms as the director of several mutual funds based in Houston. One of them, Criterion U.S. Government Institutional Trust, paid her $37,950 in directors fees last year.    Sen. Bentsen joined in co-sponsoring an unsuccessful Democratic-backed effort to impose limits on campaign spending, but his image is less one of a reformer than a man who has mastered the system in private and public. &quot;Solid, stolid, and able,&quot; says his GOP colleague on the Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Robert Packwood.    Federal Election Commission reports show Mr. Bentsen had raised $1.5 million from political action committees during the 15 months that ended March 31. Publicity forced him to disband a &quot;breakfast club&quot; of PAC donors last year, but business interests with a stake in legislation before his committee have still lined up to give the maximum $10,000. These include Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the National Association of Life Underwriters, and National Venture Capital Association, as well as Atlantic Richfield Co. and the Chicago Board of Trade.    Like his fellow Texas Democrat, House Speaker Jim Wright, Mr. Bentsen has taken a keen interest in the troubles of his home state's battered savings and loan industry, says Edwin Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. But unlike Mr. Wright, Mr. Gray says, the senator never asked him to take any specific action, and never intervened on behalf of a specific institution. &quot;He was always a perfect gentleman,&quot; Mr. Gray says.     Lloyd Bentsen on the Issues  Trade        Opposed the protectionist Gephardt amendment,               but advocates tougher policy with the Japanese               and supports the plant-closing notification               bill.
