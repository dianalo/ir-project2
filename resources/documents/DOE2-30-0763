Ultrasonic characterization methods included longitudinalvelocity, reflection coefficient, and precise attenuation measurements.The SiC bars were tailored to provide bulk densities ranging from 90to 98 percent of theoretical, average grain sizes ranging from 3.0 to12.0 microns, and average pore sizes ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 microns.Velocity correlated with specimen bulk density irrespective of specimenaverage grain size, average pore size, and average pore orientation.Attenuation coefficient was found to be sensitive to both density andaverage pore size variations, but was not affected by large differencesin average grain size.</TEXT></DOC>
