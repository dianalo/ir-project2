(new products) (Start Up)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bobker, Steven.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>1 MultiClip 2.0 ........***** 1/2 MultiClip 2.0 is a much improved version ofan already good product that lets you have, in effect, many Clipboards.andP;  Thismakes many graphics and page-layout applications easier to use.andM;Performance, reliability, and compatibility are all noticeably better than inprevious versions, and ease of use has been enhanced considerably.andM;This version also features a host of new features.andP;  The one I find mostuseful is the ability to name and see the names of each ClipFrame(MultiClip's name for its Clipboards), which makes finding a frame mucheasier.andP;  You can also select ClipFrames by name from a submenu.andP;  For arun-down on the program's basic features and operation, see the review,September `89, page 82.)andM;Olduval, 7520 Red Road, Suite A, South Miami FL 33143; (305) 665-4885.andO;Version 2.0 $129.andM;2 FastLabel ....****andM;FastLabel is a very good volume label creator and printer.andP;  It has excellenttools for designing labels, which can include graphics and icons.andP;  There'seven a built-in icon editor.andM;The program includes a small but useful selection of positioning and graphicstools to enhance labels, which can have two typefaces, each in differentsizes.andM;You can combine labels into templates to make best use of your label stock.andO;And you can print envelopes by treating diem as large labels.andP;  FastLabel'sprinting performance is very good.andP;  I used a LaserWriter IINTX and aDeskWriter and got equivalent results.andM;FastLabel's weakness is in its list handling.andP;  Only tab-delimited files canbe imported, and only absolutely pure - that is, non-delimited - text filescan be exported.andP;  Internal tools for list maintenance aren't powerful enoughfor users with lots of data.andP;  Vertical Solutions advises you to do listmanipulation in a database that can export tab-delimited files.andM;Vertical Solutions, P. O. Box 7535, Olympia, WA 98507; (206) 352-2087.andO;Version 2.0.andP;  $139.95andM;3  Bridge ....***andM;My college minor was bridge.andP;  Getting four players together has become harderas the years have passed.andP;  Bridge, version 6.0, can usually provide afriendly game, however - just don't expect to have good opponents.andM;B ridge wasn't originally designed for the Mac and doesn't support color orany of the niceties of the Mac interface.andP;  (For example, there are lots ofmodal steps to wade through.) Bidding is usually reasonable, but the computerdoes have a tendency to overvalue distribution and rebid, repeatedly, trulyawful holdings.andP;  You can make some of the impossible contracts, though,because the program isn't a real good card player.andM;Bridge is playable, and it's often the only game in town.andM;Artworx Software, 1844 Penfield Road, Penfield, NY 14526; (800) 828-6573 or(716) 385-6120.andP;  Version 6.0.andP;  #39.95andM;4  Hyper Toolkit .... **** 1/2andM;Hyper Toolkit is a large collection of HyperCard developmental tools andXCMDs.andP;  Using these self-documented tools, you can easily add color, pop-upmenus, fancy dialog boxes, and much more to your stacks.andP;  The tools aregenerally easy to use, and all of them work as the documents suggest.andO;Serious HyperCard developers will want to have a copy of Hyper Toolkitaround.andM;Many of the Toolkit's features come in a stack that you install.andP;  Followingthe simple installation process, a new menu with your options appears inHyperCard's menu bar.andP;  The larger XCMDs are separate, and you install theminto your stacks manually.andM;The main drawback is the lack of hard-copy documentation.andP;  All the necessarydetails are there on-line, but having to scroll through to find theinformation you need is tedious and ineffective way to document developmentaltools.andP;  Simply printing them doesn't help, as parts are linked to otherparts.andP;  It's a case of HyperCard being too its own good.andM;Shared Intelligence, 1001 Bridgeway, Suite 279, Sausalito, CA 94965; (415)331-2061.andP;  Version 2.0 $99.andM;5  INITPicker ....****andM;An INIT and cdev manager is a basic power user's tool.andP;  As new INITs andcdevs multiply, conflicts become common.andP;  If you lack a good manager, Macusage can degenerate into chaos.andM;INITPicker is one of the best INIT and cdev managers available.andP;  It offersall the basic functionality you'll ever need and lots more.andP;  You can dragINITs to the exact position in the loading-order chain you desire.andP;  BombPrevention, if enabled, automatically disables any INIT it catchesconflicting with another one.andP;  There are audible as well as visual warningsand alerts.andM;INITPicker would be virtually perfect, except that you either have to set itto scan for new INITs every time you restart (a slow process for most people)or remember to manually scan and turn on newly installed INITs.andP;  That's apain.andP;  I often forget to do it and then wonder why my new INIT won't load.andM;MicroSeeds Publishing, 7030-B W. Hillsborough Ave., Tampa FL 33934; (813)882-M.andP;  Version 2.0.andP;  $89.andM;6  miniWriter 1.6 ....**** 1/2andM;Back in the days when MacWrite could handle only one open document at a time,many of us got to know David Dunham's miniWriter very well.andP;  It was the onlyeffective way to cut and paste between documents or to work on multiple filesat die same time.andP;  Back then a handy DA text editor was a godsend, andminiWriter hasn't lost its luster.andM;miniWriter is the best note-writing DA, far out-shining Apple's weak NotePad.andO;Designed for dotmatrix printers  miniWriter has a custom font that looksunusually good when you use an ImageWriter), it prints very well on laser andinkjet printers too.andM;Features include the ability to convert plain quotes (&quot;) to the betterlookingcurly, or printer's, quotes (.... ) and the ability to remove curly quotes(necessary for much telecommunications work).andM;The Find feature works well.andP;  You can set the typeface and size for the wholedocument but not for individual words.andP;  Only files in text format can beopened and handled.andP;  If you want fancy formatting, you have to use your wordprocessor rather than miniwriter.andM;Overall, miniwriter bas a slick feel and is easy to use.andP;  I've tried fanciertext-editing DAs, but I always go back to miniwriter.andM;Maltreya Design, P.O. Box 1480, Goleta, CA 93116.andP;  Version 1.6 Shareware, $12andM;7 HyperSpeller ....**** 1/2andM;The one utility that HyperCard has been missing all along is a spellingchecker.andP;  Interactive spelling checkers, such as Thunder 11 and SpellingCoach Professional, check your work as you enter it into a text field, butthey're no help in batch checking, which is usually what you require whencreating a stack.andM;HyperSpeller adds this much needed feature to all HyperCard stacks.andP;  You caninstall HyperSpeller in any stack, and it checks the contents of text fieldson all cards or any subset of cards.andP;  There's no way to check just aparticular field on a card, however; all fields must be checked.andM;Installation is easy, and HyperSpeller's performance is excellent.andP;  Speed ismore a function of HyperCard than of HyperSpeller (it's sort of slow).andO;HyperSpeller uses the same Microlytics dictionary that MacWrite 11 and otherapplications use, so you'll be able to save considerable disk space if youalready have it.andM;As a bonus, there's a Find/Replace XCMD that can be installed in any stack.andM;Foundation Publishing, 14228 ShoreLane, Prior Lake, MN 55372; (612) 445-8860.andO;$49.95.andM;8  Reunion ....**** 1/2andM;Reunion is one of the nicest genealogy programs I've seen.andP;  Although it'sbased on HyperCard, it's so well done that you don't notice HyperCard's sizeand performance limitations.andP;  The various cards link intelligently andautomatically.andP;  Reunion supports GEDCOM and most of GEDCOM's PAFimplementation; the few minor exceptions are clearly noted.andM;Reunion is a complex program, but it is well served by its excellent manual.andO;Using Reunion is easy, and data entry is logical.andP;  The program includes spaceand tools for adding digitized photos as well as an index and a birthdaysfile.andP;  Pedigree and descendant charts, which are too large for HyperCard, arecreated, displayed, and printed by a utility application called SuperChart.andO;It works very well, printing out attractive charts quickly and with a minimumof fuss.andM;Leister Productions, 14 Hill Blvd., Mechanicsburg, PA 17055; (717) 697-1378.andO;$129.andM;9 Media Letter ....**** 1/2andM;Interactive media and multimedia technologies are complex fields.andP;  Even ifyou think they're more smoke than fire, they're important to the Mac.andO;Learning about them and gathering specific, useful information has,heretofore, been an arduous task.andP;  Several publications cover this area, butmost of them are written for the already knowledgeable and committed.andM;Media Letter is different.andP;  This monthly publication covers both basic andadvanced material and seems aimed at users of these technologies rather thanat developers.andP;  Denise Caruso is the editor-she's a superb writer as well-and she's assembled an excellent group of contributing writers.andM;Among the topics covered are the serious ethical issues the new media haveexposed, application notes from differing areas, and some really good opinionpieces.andP;  Media Letter is a must if you plan to be or must be involved withmultimedia and interactive technology.andP;  Even if you're not creating anymultimedia projects yourself, you'll get something valuable out of MediaLetter.andM;The Myriad Group, P.O.
