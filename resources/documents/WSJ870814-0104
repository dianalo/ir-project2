While some indulged in impulse buying, many just wanted to chat.    &quot;We've seen an increase in equity (fund) sales, but we don't see any kind of panic buying,&quot; said Jack Brennan, chief financial officer of Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard Group, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average's push into new territory. &quot;We wouldn't see the cash flow for a bit. It takes a while to get into the system.&quot;    Mr. Brennan figures that for the most part, fund investors &quot;are either in the market (already) and they're happy or feel they've missed the run and it's too late.&quot;    Still, he notes that Vanguard Index Trust, which mirrors the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index and appeals to those who want a market clone, has been &quot;doing gangbusters.&quot;    T. Rowe Price Associates says its phones have been ringing about 50% more this month than in July. A spokesman for the Baltimore-based group estimates that half the calls from current shareholders result in a transaction of some sort -- a purchase, sale or exchange. Normally, about one-third of the call-ins end up in a trade, he says. Most recent buying at T. Rowe has focused on two funds: New Horizons and New Era. The $1.2 billion New Horizons Fund specializes in the stocks of small companies while the $921 million New Era Fund features natural resource issues plus a liberal sprinkling of blue-chip stocks.    One spot where a phone call is likely to mean business is Charles Schwab andamp; Co.'s Mutual Fund Marketplace. For a fee, that service acts as a clearinghouse, allowing investors to trade 285 funds from several investment companies -- a task brokers can do more quickly than individuals.    Much of the business Schwab brokered early in the week went to index funds, a spokesman says. &quot;A lot of emotion gets involved,&quot; says Hugo Quackenbush, a senior vice president at Schwab. Volume was still heavy at midweek, &quot;but not nearly as frenetic&quot; as earlier, he notes.    Overall, the discount broker's biggest account holdings at June 30 were: $150 million of Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund; $94 million of Mutual Shares Corp., and $53 million of Vanguard Index Trust.    ---   WHAT BONDS? It isn't easy finding a mutual fund that admits to ever owning any of the 100 or so municipal bond issues that are the subject of a federal probe examining their tax-free status.    A spot check of about 30 funds' shareholder reports turned up $9.3 million of questioned Provo City, Utah, bonds in the Vanguard Municipal Bond Fund Short-Term Portfolio, which has about $1.1 billion in assets.    &quot;We sold them in July,&quot; says Ian MacKinnon, Vanguard senior vice president. He said the Provo City bonds were sold back to the dealer at a small loss. &quot;We lost an eighth (of a point). It wasn't the end of the world.&quot; The holdings represent significantly less than 1% of the fund's total assets.    Early this summer, a handful of issues sold by New York-based Matthews andamp; Wright Group Inc. came under scrutiny. Now investigators are reportedly looking at possible violations of issuance requirements involving issues from several underwriters totaling about $12 billion.    Mr. MacKinnon concedes that getting anyone to acknowledge owning the bonds &quot;is like 'button, button, who's got the button?' It's the great vanishing act. But these bonds haven't disappeared.&quot;    The options for investors at this point are either to sell the bonds or hang on to them in belief they'll pass tax-free muster. If they don't, there's a chance investors might have to pay retroactive tax on all interest income.    But even identifying the bond issues hasn't been easy. Several fund groups, including Vanguard, say they scrambled through a paper chase of their bond holdings earlier this summer.    It's generally believed that since mutual funds are well diversified, the suspect holdings shouldn't greatly affect fund portfolios. It's also generally believed that any funds that held targeted bonds have sold them by now.    Meantime, the underwriters who have so far been identified say their bonds are fine. The probe started with a group of suspected sham offerings rushed out to beat a tax-law change that put a crimp in so-called arbitrage bond issues. Such financings allow a municipality to sell tax-exempt bonds and invest the proceeds in higher-interest securities. That provides income to issuers, fees to underwriters and returns to investors while waiting for a project's start-up.    ---   Money Fund Assets Drop   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 392 money market funds fell $75.3 million to $241.92 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said.    The decline follows a revised increase of $88.9 million last week, which had been reported as a $508.1 million decline. Last week's revised total was $241.99 billion.    Assets of 200 general purpose funds fell $757.9 million to $68.31 billion while assets of 92 broker-dealer funds rose $511.5 million to $106.75 billion, and assets of 100 institutional funds rose $171.1 million to $66.85 billion.    In the week ended Tuesday, the average seven-day yield for funds rose to 6% from 5.99% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for funds dropped to 5.99% from 6.01%, and the average maturity of funds increased to 47 days from 46 days.    Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.35% on money-market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, compared with 5.41% the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were 6.43% on six-month savings certificates of deposit, compared with 6.46% the previous week, and 6.9% for one-year bank savings CDs, unchanged from last week. </TEXT></DOC>
