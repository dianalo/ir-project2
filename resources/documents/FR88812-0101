It is an unfortunate fact that the scourge of crimecontinues to occupy the head of the list of national problems crying outfor immediate action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Those who have experienced the pain, the loss, the sense of violationand frustration that accompany crime know that defeating it requires morethan tougher laws and surer punishments_though tougher and surer they are.Truly effective law enforcement demands our reliance on one of our greathistorical strengths as a Nation: the willingness of our people to bandfreely together, in local communities, in defense of lives, homes, andproperty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Local crime watch committees, in cooperation with law enforcementofficers and the appropriate government agencies, can make a real differencein crime rates. As McGruff the anti-crime dog, the familiar national symbolof crime prevention, would put it: They take a bite out of crime. But thebenefits of such citizen groups do not stop there: Their work teaches childrenrespect for law, reinforces community values, and encourages the kind ofindividual responsibility that makes for healthy, creative neighborhoodspeopled by safer and happier citizens.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The growth of these committees is truly encouraging. Today over 19million Americans participate in neighborhood watch programs, keeping aneye out for crime near their homes, reporting suspicious activity to thepolice, and providing escorts to elderly or vulnerable citizens.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">And for the last several years, millions of Americans have joinedin the highly visible ``National Night Out,'' an evening sponsored by theNational Association of Town Watch in which families spend the period from8 o'clock to 9 o'clock p.m. on their front porch or lawn as a way of sayingto potential criminal  predators: ``You had better think twice, becausein this community neighbors look out for each other.'' This worthwhileevent has been extended this year to 10 o'clock.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 294, has designated August9, 1988, as ``National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day'' and has authorizedand requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of thisevent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim August 9, 1988, as National Neighborhood CrimeWatch Day.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day ofAugust, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, andof the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred andthirteenth.<ITAG tagnum="65">andPres;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">[FR Doc. 88-18396</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Filed 8-10-88; 4:27 pm]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="50">Billing code 3195-01-M<FTAG tagnum="4705"/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day, 1988</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
