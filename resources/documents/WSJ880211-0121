Legislators and Banking Superintendent Jill Considine are drafting a bill that would greatly soften New York's 53-year-old &quot;mini-Glass-Steagall&quot; law, which prevents state-supervised banks from underwriting and selling most securities.    New York's money-center banks have lined up in favor of the legislation, even though they would benefit much less than smaller state-supervised banks, because the big banks see passage of the bill as a step toward getting federal law changed.    The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 is intended to protect the banking system from the volatility of the securities markets. The law prevents federally supervised banks from underwriting and dealing in securities, except for public general obligation bonds and U.S. Treasury securities.    Ms. Considine said the state bill would repeal the portion of the law that prohibits state banks from setting up securities affiliates. The banking department would allow state banks to underwrite municipal revenue bonds and mutual funds. The banks' securities affiliates could underwrite commercial paper, investment-grade corporate bonds and securities backed by consumer receivables, such as mortgages.    Sections of the law would be retained prohibiting bank underwriting of corporate stocks and less-than-investment-grade bonds, and limiting bank lending to, and investment in, affiliates.    Assuming a bill is introduced, a vote by the Legislature could come by mid-April.    Smaller state-chartered banks that aren't members of the Federal Reserve System would benefit immediately from any loosening of the state law. Like them, money-center banks could underwrite mutual funds and municipal revenue bonds, but certain Federal Reserve regulations would limit their scope.    Eugene Swanzey, director of government relations for Chase Manhattan Corp., said of the New York situation: &quot;We're optimistic that it's going to happen. We've gotten a good reception from the leadership of both houses.&quot;    Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, a Democrat and chairman of the Assembly's banking committee, said, &quot;I favor it. With all the firings on Wall Street, maybe this is the shot in the arm that we need. The banks will start up operations, and there will be an increase in jobs.&quot;    Opponents of further encroachment by banks into the securities business are alarmed by the muscle that banks are putting behind the issue and the reception they are getting. In recent weeks, big banks, including Citicorp and Chemical New York Corp., have hosted luncheons and tours of their trading rooms for legislators.    Assemblyman Peter M. Sullivan, a Republican who serves on the banking committee and opposes any change in the law, notes that banks have tried unsuccessfully to get the law loosened in the past. But he adds: &quot;This year is different. There has never been this huge degree of activity before on this issue.&quot;    If New York doesn't ease the law, some banks are saying they will move their securities activities to Delaware, which last year eased its ban on bank underwriting of securities, according to Mr. Sullivan, the assemblyman. Mr. Sullivan said that Richard Simmons, Chemical vice chairman, &quot;told me that if New York's law isn't repealed by March 2, he'll move five to seven traders to Delaware to do securities.&quot;    A Chemical spokesman denied that Mr. Simmons made such a statement. L. Thomas Block, Chemical's senior vice president for governmental affairs, declined to say whether Chemical would set up a securities operation in its Delaware subsidiary. &quot;Our preference is to do business in New York,&quot; he said.    The securities industry is expected to ask Congress to extend its moratorium on federal and state regulatory approval of new bank powers. The moratorium expires March 1 and was intended to give Congress time to craft comprehensive legislation on regulation of financial services. However, congressional observers say it's highly unlikely that Congress will be ready to act by March 1.    If Congress does extend the moratorium, states might argue that Congress is violating states' rights by interfering with state-supervised banks.    Ms. Considine, New York's banking superintendent, said, &quot;When the moratorium was enacted, Congress made it clear that it was for one year only. We didn't go to court to litigate it. I kept faith with them, and I expect them to keep faith with us.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
