We have our own long record on thesubject of Iraq and its assorted neighbors. We -- who toldyou that the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor wasa good thing, and who warned during the U.S. hostage crisisand the Iraq-Iran war not to get too close to Iraq -- arehere today to tell you that Assad of Hama is a Saddam-stylecutthroat but that the royal families of Saudi Arabia andKuwait are not.   We have read various editorialists and pundits in recentdays who either want the West to trust Syria's Assad to helpus oust the Kuwaiti monarchy, or who want to tar all Arabs inthe region with the Assad brush. Surely it ought to bepossible to bring more sophistication to the subject of theArabs' future.</LP><TEXT>   A good example of the sort of helpful thinking now neededon the Gulf region was an article on this page last week bySaudi lawyer, Abdulaziz H. Fahad (&quot;Thanks to Saddam the ArabsOutgrow Arabism,&quot; August 22). He pointed out that the &quot;Arabworld&quot; has been held together by the threat of riots andassassination; a distinction was made between theperpetrators of blackmail and blackmail's victims.   &quot;The resilience of the Gulf states,&quot; Mr. Fahad wrote, &quot;mayfinally provide the needed assurance for the Arab world tojoin the democratic revolutions of the 1980s. Secure in theknowledge that their people's loyalty could not bemanipulated by outside forces in the name of Arabism, onehopes that the perennially insecure Arab regimes may turninward and start the process of democratization.&quot; (In anarticle nearby today, Mr. Fahad proposes that Saudi Arabiaseize the current opportunity to liberate itself from OPEC.)   If now the Saudis and Kuwaitis learn that they can standup to this &quot;Arab world&quot; and that they can in fact rely on theUnited States, they indeed have some prospect of evolutiontoward democracy.   There seems to be a general mood in political circles nowto somehow remove the leadership in places such as Kuwait oreven Saudi Arabia with a wave of our hand and turn thecountry over to the people. Recall, though, what followedwhen we judged the Shah to be irredeemably undemocratic.Perhaps the Persian Gulf will at last have some chance ofevolving toward greater pluralism if Western intellectualsstop agitating a politics of overthrow for its governments.   The Kuwaitis have already held some democraticexperiments, and in general have done well by their people.The Saudis have been host to the Islamic pilgrimages, withthe risks that has demonstrably carried. Hosni Mubarak hasbeen struggling, at considerable personal risk, to modernizethe politics and economy of an Egypt that in the early daysof Arabism gave the world Nasser.   Contrast these efforts at political and social meliorationwith the Syria of Hafez al Assad. Assad not only did Hama(subdued at cost of at least 10,000 lives in 1982), but is inmilitary control of the territory in which theLebanon-related U.S. hostages are being held. If, as nowseems to be the case, these hostages are held by relatives ofthe terrorists who are prisoners in Kuwait, then everyoneknows exactly who they are. The Syrian authorities with thetroops and police on the ground should be held responsible.   If the forces in the Gulf now led by the U.S. eliminatethe Iraqi threat, it seems likely that the Middle East willundergo a long period of reordering its status quo. It iscertainly in the interests of the West and of the populationslong under the heel of Arabism to see significant parts ofthis region begin the process of integrating with an orderlyworld system. When that process begins, it will be importantfor the West to recognize Arabs who want to help create acivilized world and Arabs who wish to prevent it.</TEXT></DOC>
