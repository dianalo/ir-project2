Reed says export controls were revised too slowly in the pastand technology in the East is higher than expected.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ExportEastern EuropeSoviet UnionGovernment RegulationInternational TradePolitical IssuesDeregulationCoordinating Committee for Multilateral Export ControlsSemiconductor Equipment and Materials International.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
