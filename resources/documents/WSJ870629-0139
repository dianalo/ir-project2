Little red lines zigzag up toward the upper right-hand corner of each page, passing the green and blue lines of competing investment companies in other countries.    &quot;Unbelievable,&quot; he says.    The Mexican stock market has outperformed every other stock market in the world this year. Even after adjusting for inflation, currently running at 125% a year, the Shares Price Index, a weighted average of 40 Mexican stocks, has more than doubled its level of 1979 -- just before years of economic turbulence began.    Mr. Gomez Pimienta, president of the Mexico Fund, is happy -- although chastened. In 1981, he first promoted the fund in a round-the-world roadshow, saw the initial offering oversubscribed at $12 a share, then watched the Mexican economy collapse. Within six months, the share price fell to $2, and Mr. Gomez Pimienta was back on the road, trying to tell investors where their money had gone.    &quot;We learned a major lesson in all this exercise,&quot; he says. &quot;Countries don't go bankrupt.&quot;    Since 1980, Mexico has weathered an oil boom, a debt crash, the overnight seizure by the government of its banks, the announcement that it had no hard currency, a round of painful belt-tightening, a short-lived recovery, a massive earthquake and last year's oil-market collapse.    Today, economists say the overall Mexican economy is still bottoming out, and fears are widespread that the government won't be able to manage inflation. But stock prices are surging.    Mr. Gomez Pimienta isn't the only investor riding the wave. Mexican brokerages are raking in profits this year, while local investors are bringing back capital that economists had considered expatriated for good. And in extreme cases, stock-pickers have been able to triple their paper assets in as little as three weeks.    Still, investors wonder how long the upswing will last. Each time the market slips, as it did briefly last week, some believe a long-awaited &quot;correction&quot; may be upon them. And those who watch the Mexican economy wonder whether the booming stock market is a passing sensation, or a sign of lasting economic recovery.    &quot;Mexico still has a lot of problems,&quot; says Mr. Gomez Pimienta. &quot;But the perception is there that we are heading for an improvement.&quot;    &quot;People feel they have been through almost everything that fate and circumstance and human volition are prepared to throw at them,&quot; says Timothy Heyman, head of research at the Estrategia Bursatil brokerage, and the author of a recent book on investing in Mexico. &quot;We've been through all that and we're still here. It's a very deep psychological point.&quot;    The point started hitting home in the summer of 1986, when the Mexican government -- still reeling from the disastrous fall in oil prices -- sharply devalued the peso and severely tightened credit. While the policies were wildly unpopular, they convinced some investors that the government was willing to put economic health ahead of its own image. Stock prices began to move upward.    In November, the government issued a budget that spelled out the ways -- however dicey -- it hoped to fuel economic growth and fight inflation at the same time. More investors bought stock. Meanwhile, oil prices had begun moving up.    Then, early this spring, investors sensed that a $7.7 billion loan package Mexico had been trying to wring out of its foreign banks since the previous summer was about to come through. Part of the loan money was to be used for big, public-sector investment projects, and although the money still hasn't been spent by government officials worried about inflation, investors started buying construction stocks anyway. At the end of February, for instance, 21% of the Mexico Fund's assets were in glass and cement.    To top it off, Mexican banks -- government-owned since 1982 -- started offering new stock to the public in February. The shares were priced low, and the price of the first issue -- Banco Nacional de Mexico -- tripled in three weeks.    Word of the bank-stock jackpot spread, and suddenly everyone wanted into the stock market. Some analysts now think the best bargains are gone.    &quot;Stocks are no longer selling at less than one-fifth or one-third of their book value,&quot; cautions Sidney Wise, editor of the Mexican Business andamp; Investment newsletter. &quot;And 20 of the most active stocks are selling at prices above their book value.&quot;    Tokyo and London Stocks   Stock prices in Tokyo fell Saturday after inching up Friday. The Nikkei stock average ended Saturday's half-day session down 147.11 points at 24902.72 after rising 18.48 Friday.    Volume Saturday totaled 700 million shares, compared with 900 million shares Friday.    Among the most active shares Saturday, Mitsubishi Electric fell 10 yen to 662 yen ($4.52), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries inched up one yen to 616 yen, Nippon Steel was unchanged at 325 yen and Sumitomo Light Metal rose 19 yen to 454 yen.    In London Friday, prices closed higher in active trading, with the 100-share index up 14.1 points at 2291.3 and the Financial Times 30-share index up 18.2 points at 1790.7. Volume rose to 901.8 million shares from 645 million shares Thursday.    Volume accelerated sharply in the afternoon after a lethargic start, dealers said.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                % This                         June 24    June 23     Year    U.S. ................ 286.4      287.8     + 25.6    Britain ............. 685.2      680.2     + 37.7    Canada .............. 409.4      409.4     + 22.9    Japan .............. 1266.2     1268.7     + 34.0    France .............. 407.6      413.3     -  0.1    Germany ............. 230.4      237.4     - 11.3    Hong Kong .......... 2284.8     2236.3     + 28.4    Switzerland ......... 187.5      190.3     -  6.7    Australia ........... 326.1      326.9     + 23.6    World index ......... 469.5      468.2     + 31.6</TEXT></DOC>
