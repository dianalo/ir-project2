He could be eligible for parole after serving fourmonths.   Mr. Foont was head trader for a series of limitedpartnerships called the Cralin partnerships. Mr. Feldman wasa principal and promoter of the partnerships. The U.S.attorney's office in Manhattan charged that the partnershipswere used in the pre-arranged transactions to create phonylosses for tax deductions of about $140 million. Thepartnerships were marketed to investors for their taxbenefits, and investors didn't know that the tax lossesweren't legitimate, prosecutors said.   Because the crime occurred in the early 1980s, new federalsentencing guidelines don't apply in this case. AssistantU.S. Attorney Robert Cleary said that under the newguidelines, Mr. Foont would have been sentenced to 63 to 78months in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
