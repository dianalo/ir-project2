Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> F GOVMT FIN </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><TEXT>   Federal regulators have signed a preliminary agreement for the Robert M. Bass Group to acquire the deeply troubled thrift unit of Financial Corp. of America with several hundred million dollars of government assistance, officials familiar with the negotiations said.    The agreement was signed this week in secret by members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the officials said. They said the agreement provides that for a specified period, believed to be 75 days, the Bank Board will negotiate exclusively with the Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, to reach a final agreement to acquire American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the nation's second-largest thrift.    Exact terms of the proposed acquisition couldn't be learned, and officials cautioned that the transaction could still fall apart for a variety of reasons. However, if it proceeds as planned, the Bass Group would provide an infusion of capital into American Savings, in return for federal aid. Because of the thrift's massive losses on soured loans and foreclosed real estate over the past four years, its capital is about $1.3 billion short of regulatory requirements, and its liabilities exceeded its assets by $106 million at Dec. 31.    An acquisition of American Savings would relieve the Bank Board of its largest single headache. The Bank Board has been trying to find a rescuer for American Savings for more than a year and last month issued an unprecedented guarantee to all the thrift's depositors and general creditors.    But the acquisition would strip Irvine, Calif.-based FCA of its main operating unit, leaving the company with little hope of recovery. And it would make the Bass Group, led by one member of the wealthy Texas family, a major player in the highly competitive California Sandamp;L industry.    Officials of the Bank Board, Bass Group and FCA all declined to comment.    FCA said previously that if the Bank Board decides to take control of American Savings or to assist another company in an acquisition, neither FCA nor its shareholders might be compensated in the transaction.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, FCA shares closed at $1.125, unchanged.    In reaching its agreement with the Bank Board, the Bass Group beat out a competing bid from Ford Motor Co., the officials said. The Bank Board, which had broken off talks with Ford about acquiring American Savings in January, asked Ford to submit another bid about two weeks ago, the officials said.    Ford offered to put enough cash into American Savings to bring its capital up to regulatory standards, and sought about $1.6 billion in assistance over 10 years from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The FSLIC insures thrift depositors up to $100,000 each and is controlled by the Bank Board.    Officials familiar with the negotiations said the Bass Group's bid sought less FSLIC assistance than Ford's, but is structured differently and involves a somewhat smaller infusion of cash. One official said the Bass Group was believed to have requested only about $500 million of FSLIC assistance.    Officials of Ford, which already owns First Nationwide Bank, the nation's seventh-largest, reached handshake agreements with Bank Board member Roger Martin last October and December to acquire American Savings. But the accords fell apart before any written agreements were signed, the officials said.    A spokesman for San Francisco-based First Nationwide said he couldn't confirm or deny that the thrift had resubmitted a bid for American Savings.    FCA, with more than $30 billion in assets, posted a $468 million loss last year, largely because it boosted its reserves for loan and real estate losses by $551 million. Since FCA's current management was installed by the Bank Board -- after a $6.8 billion deposit run in 1984 -- the company has added more than $1.6 billion to its loss reserves.    The main attractions of American Savings are its network of 185 branches in California, its $15 billion retail deposit base, and more than $1 billion in federal income tax deductions. However, its assets include about $5 billion of troubled loans and foreclosed real estate, mostly in California and Texas, that could continue to generate losses. In addition, it remains heavily exposed to potential losses from rising interest rates, because most of its $26 billion of loans and mortgage-backed securities carry fixed rates, while the bulk of its deposits bear interest at near market rates.    American Savings' portfolio of mortgage-backed securities alone has a book value of about $16 billion, and contains paper losses estimated at several hundred million dollars. Under orders from the Bank Board, American Savings took advantage of falling interest rates and sold about $2.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities to reduce its exposure to additional losses. The value of mortgage-backed securities, like bonds, rises as interest rates fall.    Mr. Martin of the Bank Board has said that the paper losses in American Savings' mortgage-backed securities portfolio reached a peak of about $2.4 billion last October, just before the stock market crash and the subsequent drop in interest rates. Earlier this year, Mr. Martin said the paper losses had narrowed to about $400 million. Rising interest rates, however, would increase the losses. </TEXT></DOC>
