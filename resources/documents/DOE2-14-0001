The investigations were made during the winter 1982-1983which was warmer than normal and during the normal winter 1983-1984.The results are summarized as follows: -The coefficient of performanceof a separate ground source heat pump amounts to between 2.5 to 1.9.The yearly mean value is 2.21 which is normal for the prevailing temperaturesituation. -The coefficient of performance of a heat pump (U3 and U6)incorporated in a system amounts to between 1.85 to 1.2. The reason forthe low system coefficient is that all the heat pumps are connected toone system and are operating simultaneously. This results in the pumpsoperating at a low load and with short operation periods. Due to thisthe operation conditions for the heat pumps are unfavourable resultingin a lower coefficient of performance. -The functioning of the climatecage is made clear. The energy requirement for heat transmission is decreasedby c. 5%. The energy demand for heating ventilating air is desreasedby c. 20%. Calculations show that the influence of the climate cage impliesa decrease of installed maximum power by c. 1kW per apartment. -The swampis an excellent heat source where the charging and discharging periodssucceed each other without affecting respective function.</TEXT></DOC>
