But SEC economists found that over a one-year period, stock with lower voting rights traded 2% to 8% below the higher-vote stock, depending on the dividend.    The SEC chief economist's office studied the common stock prices of 63 companies that have adopted dual-class recapitalization plans since 1976. The study was prompted by the New York Stock Exchange's proposal last year to abandon its one-share, one-vote standard in favor of listing classes of stock with disproportionate voting rights.    &quot;The results do not support the hypothesis that dual-class recapitalizations negatively affect shareholder wealth,&quot; the study says. &quot;The evidence tends to support the contention that dual-class common stock is a viable form of corporate structure which allows growing firms, and firms owned by family entrepreneurs, to raise additional equity capital to finance rewarding investment projects without increasing debt or diluting voting control.&quot;    The findings, however, don't provide a &quot;blanket approval&quot; of dual-class recapitalizations, the study said. Most of the 63 companies were booming concerns, with much of their common stock in the hands of insiders. The findings suggest that recapitalizations don't hurt the stock prices of such companies as much as other companies.    The study, released yesterday, cautioned that the shareholders of slower-growing companies with less insider control might suffer &quot;significant wealth losses&quot; if recapitalization gave insiders sufficient voting power to entrench themselves.    The SEC took the study into account earlier this month when it proposed prohibiting the nation's stock markets from listing companies that reduce or nullify the voting rights of existing shareholders. The proposal, however, would exempt any company that had issued dual or multiple classes of stock with unequal voting rights by May 15. Many such recapitalizations were adopted as a defense against hostile takeovers.    The study included companies listed on the Big Board and American Stock Exchange as well as the national over-the-counter market. In analyzing the market reaction to recapitalization plans, SEC economists found that share prices dipped only a fraction of 1% the day after the announcement. They also found share prices five days after the announcement to be 1% higher than they were five days before the announcement.    Over a 41-day period, the price increase was found to be 7%. But SEC economist Annette Poulson said that factors other than the recapitalization announcement undoubtedly figured in the change.    Big Board companies had the sharpest average increase in the voting power of insiders, increasing to 48% from 37% through recapitalizations, according to the study. </TEXT></DOC>
