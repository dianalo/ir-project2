Schlesinger   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/28/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B3</SO><CO>   J.FUT MD</CO><IN>FACTORY EQUIPMENT (FAC)SOFTWARE (SOF)COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)</IN><LP>   TOKYO -- Fujitsu Ltd. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. willannounce today a potentially wide-ranging factory-automationalliance that could include joint development and world-widemarketing.   The alliance in the rapidly growing field reflects Japan'scontinued reliance on advanced U.S. software, and growingU.S. dependence on burgeoning Japanese marketing andfinancial might in computers.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the move helps Fujitsu, the world'ssecond-largest computer maker, intensify yet another front inits global battle with No. 1 International Business MachinesCorp. IBM is also the world leader in software for productdesign and manufacturing, while Fujitsu lags far behind inthat sector. The connection with McDonnell Douglas, No. 4 inthe design and manufacturing software market, would helpFujitsu recover from an apparent setback when IBM recentlypurchased one of Fujitsu's main software suppliers.   Under the agreements to be announced today, according toone person familiar with the discussions, Fujitsu will marketin Japan a McDonnell Douglas system that improves theprecision in making dies and molds. Fujitsu will also get thelicense to a McDonnell Douglas software product used foradvanced three-dimensional designs, he said.   The two companies are also formally discussing broaderjoint projects, the person close to the talks said, but hedidn't say how much business the arrangements would cover.   A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas's British-basedInformation Systems International unit said the firstannouncement would involve Fujitsu distributing the company'sUnigraphics computerized design and manufacturing technology,combining McDonnell Douglas's software with the Japanesecompany's hardware. As part of the initial agreement,McDonnell Douglas will consider test-marketing Fujitsucomputer systems in Europe, Southeast Asia and the PacificRim. The spokesman said the significance of the agreement &quot;isto give us entree into Japan.&quot;   The company's Unigraphics software is used by McDonnellDouglas in designing aerospace products for the defenseindustry, but has many other manufacturing applications usedby a wide range of industries.   Mechanical computer-aided design and manufacturing is usedto help make mechanical objects, such as artificial limbs.That is one sector of the expanding market for CAD/CAM, whichis also used to design computer parts, such assemiconductors, or for architectural design. While computershave been used for such functions since the 1960s, the typeof advanced three-dimensional systems covered by theFujitsu-McDonnell agreements are only now becoming common.   Since 1989, McDonnell Douglas has been lessening its focuson information systems to concentrate on its core aerospacebusiness. The company considered spinning off its InformationSystems International unit into a public company of whichMcDonnell Douglas would be a minority shareholder, but lastyear the plan was postponed because of market conditions. In1989, the company sold a related unit, its electronicdata-communications business, to British TelecommunicationsPLC for $355 million. The spokesman said the company'sInformation Systems International had unaudited sales of $450million in 1990. McDonnell Douglas's total 1989 revenue was$14.59 billion.   The source said that, despite the Fujitsu alliance,Fujitsu isn't currently negotiating to buy the McDonnellDouglas information-systems operations.   McDonnell Douglas also sells its factory-automationsoftware in Japan through Seiko Instruments Inc. WhileMcDonnell Douglas plans to continue that link, the Fujitsumove signals an attempt to try and expand that business morerapidly.   ---   Richard Turner in Los Angeles contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
