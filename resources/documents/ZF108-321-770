 In the world of Centrex, it operates behind ATandamp;T 1AESS,5AESS or Northern Telecom DMS 100 central office switches that give you SMDI(Simplified Message Desk Interface).andM;The Repartee allows users to automatically transfer calls to the correctvoice mailbox.andP;  It indicates the presence of a message with a message waitinglight or stutter dialtone.andM;All call records from the SMDI are sent over a data link to the Repartee.andO;The call record provides the system with the number called, the type of callforwarding that was used and the calling number if it is within the Centrexsystem.andM;The Repartee is available in two to 16 ports or in a 24-port configuration.andO;With the introduction of networking capability in accordance with the AMIS(Audio Message Interchange Standards) specifications, Repartee systems cannetwork together, connecting offices in diverse areas, as well as interfacewith other call processing systems that offer AMIS networking.andM;AECandM;AEC's Max Receptionist provides automated attendant, voice messaging,audiotex and voice response while integrating with your Centrex system.andM;Max can be used as your primary receptionist, a backup for overflowsituations, a voice mail message desk, etc.andP;  No matter what the application,Max is an ideal complement to Direct Inward Dialing (DID) and SMDI.andM;AEC is releasing an SMDI interface for the Max Receptionist, which willprovide message box integration (routing callers directly into a user's voicemailbox in the event of a busy or no answer at the station) and messagewaiting indication via a stutter dialtone.andM;Alcatel/CortelcoandM;Meet the Tel-Trex family.andP;  This high performance line of telephones, withsophisticated console model and system controller, offer many enhancementswithout duplicating your current Centrex/PBX system features.andM;At the top of the hierarchy is the system controller with built-in powersupply and battery charger.andP;  This wall mountable unit can support two Model320 Console telephones.andM;The 320 consoles can accommodate three dedicated Centrex/PBX lines andprovide centralized answering and monitoring for up to 20 individualtelephone stations.andP;  The consoles feature two-color LED status indicators,timed disconnect, automatic line selection, automatic local-hold recall,one-button calling and two-button transferring.andM;In addition, the Tel-Trex family gives you a choice of five telephone models,ranging from an Economy Model to an Enhanced Model with handsfreespeakerphone.andP;  All the models share such features as a data port, flashbutton, electronic ringer, three volume settings and personal directory.andP;  TheStandard Model adds a mesage lamp, lighted hold button, last number redialand adjustable line release.andP;  These same features, plus additional ones,appear in the three remaining models.andM;AmtelcoandM;American Tel-A-Systems (Amtelco) has introduced a new attendant console, thePC-MX, that interfaces with Centrex to provide live operator call processingand text messaging.andM;The PC-MX interfaces to Centrex via the SMDI link, across a scanner orthrough a concentrator (analog port).andP;  The system displays detailed callinformation to attendants on a company, department or employee basis.andP;  Aseach call is directed to the console, the screen displays complete answerphrases for multiple calls, number of waiting calls and status designations(&quot;in a meeting,&quot; &quot;out of the office until,&quot; etc.).andP;  Up to 52 separate on-linedirectory listings are available with PC-MX.andM;Unanswered calls are routed to the system message center.andP;  Messages can beentered directly into the PC-MX database for convenient delivery tomini-printers, PCs, fax machines and pagers.andP;
