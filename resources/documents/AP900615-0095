Jacko was given an ``other than honorable'' discharge and $61.50before being released outside the gates of the Marine base innearby Quantico, Va., said Lt. Col. Robert McLean. He also wasgiven physical and dental exams.   Regulations required the Marines to provide the exams, plusmoney equal to three-fourths of a one-way bus ticket to the townfrom which he entered the service _ in this case, Cleveland.   Jacko, 42, deserted the Marines after completing basic trainingin 1969. He said he opposed the Vietnam war and feared he would besent there.   He has spent the last 21 years in Toronto, where he married andmanaged health food stores. He decided to turn himself in becausehe wanted to be near his mother, who is in poor health in Cleveland.   ``She just went through three operations in about the last sixmonths,'' he said in a Tuesday interview. ``I want to be able to bethere.''   Jacko presented himself at Quantico on Wednesday.   After determining there were no other outstanding charges, thebase commander, Lt. Gen. W.R. Etnyre, granted the dischargerequest, the spokesman said.   Jacko's attorney said a young Marine gave Jacko a ride toNational Airport. ``He knew who he was, too. Ron was sort of bowledover,'' said attorney Tod Ensign of the New York-based CitizenSoldier.   That group had helped arrange Jacko's return and pre-surrenderpublicity, including a trip to Capitol Hill to solicit the supportof Jacko's hometown congresswoman, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar.</TEXT></DOC>
