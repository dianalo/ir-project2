RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether the rights of white criminal defendants may be violated whenblacks are excluded from serving as jurors in their trials.   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Daniel Holland, aChicago-area white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape,kidnaping and armed robbery.   The high court in 1986 ruled that prosecutors never maydisqualify potential jurors based on their race. The rulingdramatically curtailed the traditonally broad power of prosecutorsto eliminate prospective jurors from trials by using peremptory, orautomatic, challenges.   But that case involved a black defendant and jurors of his race.The justices have not decided whether exclusion of black jurors inthis manner can violate the rights of a white defendant.   In Holland's case, two blacks among the more than 30 prospectivejurors were excluded by the prosecution from serving on the panelthat eventually convicted him.   Prosecutors said they were not motivated by racial considerationswhen they used their peremptory challenges to exclude the twoblacks, a man and a woman, from the jury.   The Illinois Supreme Court said that as a white person Hollandlacked legal standing to raise the issue of whether race played apart in the exclusion of the two blacks.   ``We decline to address this issue because we find that thedefendant, a Caucasian, does not have standing to assert (such aconstitutional) violation,'' the state court said.   The state court also rejected Holland's argument that he wasdenied his constitutional right to be tried by a fair cross-sectionof the community.   Holland was convicted in the rape and kidnaping of a Des Plaines,Ill., teen-age girl on May 4, 1980.   Prosecutors said Holland gave a ride to the girl and herboyfriend. They said he forced the boyfriend to leave the car andraped the girl at knifepoint.   Holland was arrested hours after the assault when a policestopped his car because it had no rear license plate.   The case is Holland vs. Illinois, 88-5050.</TEXT></DOC>
