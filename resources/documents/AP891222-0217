TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MAJDIA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The South Lebanon Army, created by Israelto help guard its border, has honed its fighting skills andexpanded in size. But there is no sign Israel is ready to withdrawfrom southern Lebanon and leave the fighting to its allies.   With Israeli advisers and reporters watching, the SLA recentlyshowed off its gunnery prowess in a live-fire exercise with a dozenSoviet T-55 tanks captured by the Israelis from the PalestineLiberation Organization.   Gun barrels flashed and the aging tanks, painted gray, knockedout rusty trucks on a hillside nearly a half-mile away.   The Lebanese crews, silhouetted on a ridgeline, could be seenjumping and waving their arms with delight.   The exercise, Israeli advisers stressed, marked a significantimprovement in the military capabilities of the militia that helpsIsraeli troops patrol a security zone that is 2.5 to 12 miles deepjust north of Israel's border.   However, some observers see a major problem with the militia'sreliability and discipline.   The SLA has caused Israel political embarrassment by gettinginvolved in shooting incidents with the nine-nation, 5,700-memberUnited Nations peackeeping force that patrols north of the securityzone.   It also has stirred up anti-Israeli sentiment withindiscriminate shellings of Shiite Moslem villages.   The SLA commander, Antoine Lahad, 62, a retired Lebanese armygeneral, told reporters his force made a ``lot of improvement''since Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in 1985.   ``The SLA was more like a militia. Now it has developed into asmall regular army,'' he said, adding the force numbered 3,000 men,up from 2,000 a year ago, and may expand further.   Lahad, who survived a communist-inspired assassination attemptin November 1988, said an Israeli presence was needed until Syriawithdrew its 40,000 troops from Lebanon.   ``The day we face Lebanese opponents only, we can do without thebacking of the Israeli army,'' said Lahad, a Christian whosemilitia controls an area with a predominantly Shiite Moslempopulation of 200,000.   Israel has stationed troops in Lebanon since shortly afterLebanon's civil war began in 1975.   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy spokesman for the Israeli army, saidIsrael had no plans to leave but also had no interest in Lebanonbeyond protecting its 60-mile border.   He added that the zone had proved a success because life innorthern Israel was normal and no Israeli civilian had died in anattack from Lebanon since 1985.   The SLA's reliability remains a major question mark, however.   In recent years, the Christian-led force was riddled withdefections by Shiites, had its positions overrun by Iranian-backedHezbollah guerrillas and proved unable to stop Palestinianinfiltrations into the security zone.   The SLA has also borne the brunt of Shiite and Palestinianattacks, suffering 188 killed and 600 wounded in the past fouryears. So far this year, the SLA came under 350 guerrilla attacks,about half the level of the previous year.   Despite the improvements, some experts are less confident of theSLA's ability to restrain its militiamen from exacting revenge andsay the force is incapable of standing up to guerrilla attackswithout Israeli troops, estimated by foreign reports to number atleast 1,000.   ``The SLA will hold on as long as Israeli army is the backbone.Discipline is good as long as Israeli officers are there,'' saidYoram Hamizrachi, a retired colonel who was in charge of trainingthe SLA from 1977 to 1980.   ``They are improving in military skills. They can read maps andcoordinate their actions. But they have a tendency to lose theirtempers. I wouldn't trust them in anything major.''   In early December, for example, SLA gunners retaliated for theambush killing of three SLA militiamen by firing sporadic barragesat civilian areas north of the security zone. Lebanese reports saidnine civilians were killed in the Shiite town of Nabatiyeh.   The Shiite leader, Nabih Berri, responded with a warning thathis Amal militiamen would shell Israeli settlements if the SLAattacks persisted.   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, Israel's northern front commander,conceded in a recent interview that he had frequent arguments withSLA commanders about the use of force.   He said that it was normal for Lebanese militias to fire 100 to300 shells into a small village.   Peled said it was ``quite difficult'' to get the SLA tounderstand Israel's objections but ``during the past two or threeyears we succeeded to change their behavior. I don't know if itwill go back the way it was, but there has been a tremendouschange.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thursday PMs, Dec. 28</NOTE></DOC>
