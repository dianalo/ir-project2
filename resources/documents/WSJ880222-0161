Winter (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GR </CO><IN> RUB MKT </IN><DATELINE> AKRON, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Once again, B. Charles Ames is testing his own recipes for success.    The 62-year-old author of two marketing books has assumed a task that will test that expertise: retreading the skidding Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. The nation's No. 2 tire producer hasn't forged a coherent marketing strategy since it was formed in August 1986 through the merger of Uniroyal Inc.'s and B.F. Goodrich Co.'s tire businesses.    Mr. Ames -- who has headed two other companies -- took the helm in December, shortly after Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc. decided to take over the company. The New York investment firm, which already held a 50% stake in the company through a leveraged buyout and liquidation of Uniroyal assets, agreed to pay Goodrich $225 million for its share. The transaction is scheduled for completion in April.    The buyout will solve part of the problem, Mr. Ames believes. &quot;Fifty-fifty ventures just don't work out,&quot; he says, especially when corporate cultures are as different as those at Uniroyal and Goodrich, he adds.    And Mr. Ames's marketing acumen will help, too, say former associates. &quot;The company will benefit from his outside viewpoint,&quot; says Richard B. Ainsworth Jr., vice president of finance for North American Refractories Co., who has worked with Mr. Ames. &quot;Chuck will challenge a lot of old concepts and shake things up quite a bit.&quot;    Rebuilding Uniroyal Goodrich won't be easy for Mr. Ames, a former McKinsey andamp; Co. executive whose eyes brighten and hands come alive when he talks about marketing. &quot;But at least there's a market here,&quot; he says.    The remark is a reference to Mr. Ames's travails at Acme-Cleveland Corp. After expanding Reliance Electric Co., an electric motors producer, into telecommunications products, Mr. Ames sold that company at a premium price to Exxon Corp. and in 1981 took a small cadre of Reliance veterans to Acme-Cleveland, then a $400-million-a-year machine tool maker.    At Acme-Cleveland, he says, he expected &quot;to build a billion dollar company in a few years.&quot; Instead, the machine-tool market promptly collapsed, and the company's bookings slumped 32% in his first year. Further, the company's move into computer-controlled manufacturing systems produced huge losses, and a telecommunications company Mr. Ames bought proved disappointing. Last April, when he left Acme-Cleveland to join Clayton andamp; Dubilier, he turned over to his hand-picked successor a company with a solid balance sheet and low debt but with less than half its initial annual sales.    Of his stint at Acme-Cleveland, Mr. Ames simply concludes, &quot;I don't regard it as a success.&quot;    At Uniroyal Goodrich, which last year earned only $30 million -- a skimpy 1.4% return on sales of $2.2 billion -- Mr. Ames may have only a few years to improve the company's market position. The powerful combination being forged by Japan's Bridgestone Corp. and Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co.'s tire business makes Uniroyal Goodrich's position more precarious. In addition, France's Michelin andamp; Cie is expanding its U.S. plants, as is No. 1 producer Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., and a new international consortium is forming around General Tire andamp; Rubber Co.    &quot;Bridgestone, Goodyear and Michelin will roll right over them if they can't keep up technologically,&quot; says Richard Henderson, tire analyst with Pershing andamp; Co.    Uniroyal Goodrich is considered overly dependent on sales to General Motors Corp., which has had a sharp drop in sales. Also, it sells a lot of tires to private-label customers, where margins traditionally have been low. Further, the company no longer makes tires for large trucks, which some competitors say weakens its dealer network.    Compounding its problems, Uniroyal Goodrich's marketing is splintered between two major brands. Its leading brand, Goodrich, is a weak No. 5 in replacement auto-tire sales with only 4% of the market. And according to Modern Tire Dealer, a trade publication, Uniroyal is in eighth place-tied with four other brands that each claim a 2.5% share.    Mr. Ames, as might be expected, is placing early emphasis on improving marketing. He insisted that financing for the buy-out include a substantial chunk of additional cash for advertising and marketing, mainly to strengthen the Goodrich brand. Also, he will demand a series of new tires so dealers always have something new that can command a premium price.    His strategy also includes getting Goodrich-brand tires back onto new cars. B.F. Goodrich's exit from Detroit in 1981 to concentrate on replacement-tire sales was a mistake, he says. The company, he says, can't afford to abandon the Uniroyal brand, however. &quot;It sells a lot of tires,&quot; especially to GM, Mr. Ames says.    Mr. Ames expects to stay at Uniroyal Goodrich only until &quot;I'm sure we have the right management team in place and that we are pursuing a coherent business strategy.&quot; The company then may go public, or it might be sold, possibly to a foreign buyer, Clayton Dubilier officials say. </TEXT></DOC>
