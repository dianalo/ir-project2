The government said the general strike affected 169 companiesemploying more than 137,000 workers.   Unions said, however, that workers from 800 affiliatesnationwide walked off the job, including 110 at foreign companiesbased in the Philippines. They said half a million workers oncentral Luzon island alone stayed home.   Monday's strike was called by the militant Labor AdvisoryConsultative Council, a union umbrella group that claims anationwide membership of 900,000 workers.   Council spokesman Crispin Beltran called the strike a success.   ``Workers are rediscovering their strength,'' Beltran said. Hesaid unions covered by the council also would strike Tuesday.   The strikes were called Friday by union goups hoping to increasethe daily minimum wage by $1.42. Currently, the minimum wage variesfrom $2.55 and $3 a day depending upon area and type of work.   The council said its workers also would join a nationwidewalkout Thursday called by the more moderate Trade Union Congress,which claims a membership of 1.2 million workers.   Mrs. Aquino has rejected the wage demand as inflationary and onSunday appealed to workers not to strike, saying the walkout woulddiscourage foreign investors and hurt the economy.   ``I have already appealed to them to reconsider their drasticmass action as it will prejudice the unemployed,'' Mrs. Aquinosaid. ``Prospective investors might be discouraged, and at thispoint, the most important thing is to create more jobs andlivelihood opportunities.''   On Monday, the House of Representatives approved a bill thatwould grant workers a raise of between 40 cents and $1 a day. TheSenate approved an increase of between 50 cents and $1, to beimplemented over a year.   Representatives from the two chambers were to meet Tuesday toreconcile the differences. Labor groups called the proposalsinadequate.   Troops were placed on alert in Manila but there were no reportsof violence, said Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, head of the capital'sregional defense command. He said troops in the capital wouldremain on alert through Thursday's planned strike.   In Manila, a public transportation company took its 300 busesoff the streets and scores of workers stood in picket lines outsidefactories, offices and department stores, according to radio andtelevision reports.   Drivers on two bus lines between Manila and the Bataan peninsulaand workers at 12 companies in the Bataan Export Zone also walkedoff the job, union officials said.   In Davao, 600 miles southeast of the capital, the strike hit 56factories and plantations, unions said. But local governmentofficials contacted by telephone said workers from only fivecompanies there were on strike.   The labor unrest was blamed for a drop in share prices Monday onthe Manila Stock Exchange after a month of sustained growth. TheComposite Stock Index of 25 selected issues closed 21.50 points to993.43, down from Friday's close of 1,014.93.   On Saturday, more than 170,000 workers took part in apreliminary strike, the council said.</TEXT></DOC>
