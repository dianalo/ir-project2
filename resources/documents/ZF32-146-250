And they aren'tall multimedia -- some are straight text [manuals].andP;  Every applicationdoesn't require multimedia.&quot;andM;*   Clay Gordon, REBO StudioandM;The real problem in converting to CD-ROM support is getting the existingmaterial into digital form &quot;where it can be massaged.&quot;andM;Full-motion video is &quot;not an essential part of multimedia.&quot; You can developgood, useful multimedia systems without the expense and trouble of usingvideo.andM;&quot;The most powerful 'virtual reality' is fantasies! We [the vendors] have tosupport fantasies!&quot; (Now there's an intriguing idea!)andM;*   Ed Boland, NECandM;The needed standards are not yet set! &quot;That results in fear -- in both thedevelopers and the users.&quot;andM;His version of a solution is to use computer controlled VCR.andP;  &quot;It isframe-accurate and has high speed fast- forward and rewind.&quot;andM;&quot;It doesn't have to be digital to work! VCR is a familiar technique.andP;  Thereare no expensive laser disks.&quot; &quot;A disadvantage is that you have to plan moreprecisely because the seek time is longer [you have to allow for it anddisguise it].&quot;andM;He advised us not to think too narrowly: &quot;Multimedia is what you define it tobe!&quot;andM;*   Scott Fast, Meridian DataandM;(This was a poorly delivered product commercial that had no redeeming value.)andM;*   Dr. Gabriel D. Ofiesh, Emeritus Professor,andM;Howard UniversityandM;Professor Ofiesh (who is an excellent speaker and a complete pleasure tolisten to) said he has found only two products in the (IBM) PC world --&quot;there are more for the Mac&quot; -- that work correctly:andM;1.andP;      Ziff Communication's &quot;Computer Library&quot;andM;2.andP;      Hewlett-Packard's &quot;New Wave&quot;andM;&quot;Windows is horrible!&quot; He admitted it is becoming a standard and he will be&quot;forced to use it.&quot;andM;&quot;Modern man is becoming more primitive&quot; -- he knows less about the tools(technology) that he is using.andM;&quot;Multimedia means I use whatever I can to communicate.&quot;andM;&quot;As a user, I am not worried about your [vendor's] problems with standards.&quot;andO;&quot;You have to focus on user tools.&quot; The good professor insists that everybody-- not just professionals -- must be able to use and benefit from multimediapresentations.andP;  &quot;They are a form of communication.&quot;andM;&quot;Ignorance can lead to misuse! People use new tools to do old things! We arebeating the rug with a vacuum cleaner!&quot;andM;&quot;CD-ROM is not just a large storage space in a small area.&quot; It should be usedto its full potential.andP;  In order for that to happen, it must be usable byeveryone.andM;&quot;With multimedia, I can compose the activity I want.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: Great sentence!andP;  The user can take bits and snippets from a widevariety of sources and put them together -- compose -- into precisely themessage/presentation/communication that is most appropriate for a uniquesituation.andM;&quot;We exist in a volatile environment.&quot;andP;  &quot;We must create tools that open themultimedia platform to all users.&quot; He told us he had an opportunity toobserve 6th-grade children using a Mac to construct a &quot;HyperCard stack&quot; (amultimedia presentation).andP;  &quot;It is the term paper of the future.&quot;andP;  He said hewas amazed at what the children could do.andM;Advice to vendors: &quot;Don't beta-test your stuff with other engineers, use realpeople!&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: I would have liked to sit and listen to him talk -- on anysubject he chose -- for hours.andM;Thank you, Professor Ofiesh.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
