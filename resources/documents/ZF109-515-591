 Tools of elegant simplicity thateveryone already knows how to use.andP;  Now, suppose that such tools could takethe place of keyboards on computers.andP;  Suppose you would write on the screenthe way you write on paper.andP;  Computing would be less like typing and morelike keeping a diary or jotting down a memo.andP;  Would everyone then know how touse computers?andP;  No.andP;  Would everyone need one?andP;  No, again.andP;  We would all,however, be far closer to the day when a computer is as easy to use as anotebook, a telephone, or a postcard -- and as commonplace.andM;Sony provided a glimpse of that future last week when it announced thePalmTop PCT-500, a $1,300 hand-held computer that can respond to wordswritten in Japanese on its screen with a special pen.andP;  Canon already isselling a similar machine in Japan.andP;  In the U.S., there's the new digitalclipboard from the GRiD division of Tandy, and written-input portable systemsunder development at GO Corp., of Foster City, Calif., Momenta of MountainView, Calif., and SuperScript of Cambridge, Mass.andM;Taken together, these machines are the beginning of what we'll call stylussystems.andP;  As an interface, the stylus differs more from the mouse than themouse differs from the keyboard.andP;  Stylus systems represent not only acommercially significant departure in interface but also a new class ofcomputers that eventually could change the computer industry as much asmouse-based graphical systems have changed it in the six years since theintroduction of the Apple Macintosh.andP;  In the future -- five years or so fromnow -- when coupled with digital cellular networks, the portable styluscomputer could become as important a business tool for the mobileprofessional as the cellular telephone.andM;Until then, the role of stylus systems will be more modest.andP;  Initially, thetechnology is taking the form of go-anywhere notebook computers.andP;  Next, thetechnology will extend to desktop systems that also use keyboards.andO;Gradually, stylus systems will expand the industry's base of potentialcustomers to many who would otherwise never consider buying a computer,because the technology will have disappeared into products that don'tresemble today's computers.andM;Passing time at 30,000 feetandM;As stylus systems develop, the principal risk is that the industry willpromise too much too soon, that consumers will expect machines to respond toscribbles -- handwriting that even the writer cannot always read -- and thusbe disappointed.andP;  What's more, for some work with computers, a keyboard isthe best interface and we believe it will remain the best for many, many moreyears.andP;  Typing may not be intuitive, but once you learn how, the keyboardbecomes a very high bandwidth device.andP;  As for portable embodiments of stylustechnology, remember that we have tried to serve the mobile professionalbefore.andP;  Many companies have been founded to pursue this grail -- and havefoundered.andP;  (There was a saying at The Wall Street Journal in our time:&quot;There are no new stories.andP;  There are only new reporters.&quot;)  RememberGavilan?andP;  As a target market, the term &quot;mobile professional&quot; is a seductivelyfuzzy concept.andP;  So we should keep in mind that although some people like torecalculate spreadsheets while airborne, most people don't do much computingon the road.andM;If such mistakes can be avoided, the market opportunity is large, and newcompanies may be able to take advantage of it.andM;Too many portablesandM;The opportunity exists because ordinary people can see that stylus systems --particularly those with only a stylus input -- are different from what mostof us think of as computers.andP;  That difference becomes increasingly importantas the market for computers becomes saturated.andP;  For example, althoughportables are the fastest growing segment of the computer market, it'sbecoming difficult to distinguish one product from another.andP;  Witness therecent cover story in PC Magazine that described no fewer than 73 portables.andO;That's too many machines to select from.andP;  Even the editors couldn't alwaystell them apart; the magazine reversed the pictures on two Compaq portables.andM;One more for the roadandM;By contrast, stylus-based portable systems -- let's dub them electronicnotebooks -- would seem easy to differentiate from other portables.andP;  Thefirst satisfactory electronic notebook could provide roots and nourishmentfor a young manufacturing company.andP;  Companies that pioneer in the area butchose not to manufacture also may be able to sell technology or systems-levelsoftware to Toshiba, Company, NEC or one of the other manufacturers alreadywell established in portables, or to such large but still struggling portablemakers as IBM.andP;  And if the category is successful, dozens of independentpublishers will emerge to provide applications software for it.andM;Let's begin by discussing GO Corp., which we think will soon be the mosttalked about new company since NeXT Computer.andP;  If we really knew about thecompany's product, this would be a brief letter: officially, the product is asecret and won't be introduced for a few more months.andP;  But is there anyonewho doesn't expect the GO computer to be some sort of tool, probably aportable that reads handwriting, for the mobile professional?andP;  There's evenbeen a story in USA Today.andM;What is this gizmo, anyhow?andM;So, let's assume the rumors are true, and that we know nothing more aboutGO's actual intentions.andP;  What then can we say?andP;  Well, of course, we can'tdiscuss such essential details as price, performance, appearance, technology,marketing, or distribution.andP;  But bear with us.andP;  For we can consider suchequally important matters as product definition and business strategy.andP;  In sodoing, we may learn something about the world in which the GO machine and itscontemporaries will compete for survival.andM;The traveling desktopandM;For example, what is the product, or what should it be?andP;  Is it a notebookcomputer, or an electronic notebook?andP;  Is it a briefcase computer or anelectronic briefcase?andP;  Or is it, perhaps, a digital clipboard, electricpaper, an intelligent telephone directory, or automated organizer?andP;  How, inother words, should we think of it?andP;  What functions does it serve?andP;  When theadvertising slogan writers must fix it in a phrase, what words will they use?andM;Thinking about smart paperandM;Today's so-called notebook computer is really a portable substitute for adesktop computer.andP;  What we mean now by the term &quot;notebook computer&quot; is acomputer that is not quite as large as a metropolitan telephone book.andP;  Thosewho use one need a machine that can do all the work that ordinarily is doneat a desk, but that can be carried easily from desk to desk -- even if thedesk is sometimes an airplane tray table or a table in a hotel room.andP;  Today'snotebook computer is used in the same way as today's desktop; portability isthe only difference.andP;  The applications that run on today's notebook computersare for work that usually is done alone at a desk: word processing, financialanalysis, graphic design.andM;The machines of central interest in this letter will probably also be callednotebook computers, which will cause some confusion.andP;  They are, however,something different and will, we think, redefine the category much as what wetoday call portable computers prompted us to coin the term luggables for whatwe once knew as portables.andM;No typing in the boardroom!andM;Some stylus computers will best be thought of as intelligent notebooks --electronic substitutes for paper notebooks.andP;  We can imagine using suchintelligent notebooks (unlike portable computers) in the company of otherswithout seeming rude.andP;  There would be no disruptive key clacking, no loss ofeye contact.andP;  Potentially, the intelligent notebook is a replacement for theleather-bound notebooks that some of us use in our struggle against chaos.andO;The personal information management software that almost no one uses ondesktop computers could be revitalized by the intelligent notebook.andP;  Think ofsuch a notebook as a digital Day Timer or Filofax.andP;  A place to keep notes,telephone numbers, calendars, lists of chores to be done, resolutions to bebroken.andP;  A socially acceptable way to doodle while looking busy during dullmeetings.andM;The stylus machines also must distinguish themselves from the digital diariesthat Casio, Sharp, and others sell.andP;  Although these gadgets sell at the rateof 30,000-plus a month, most buyers soon realize they are useless.andP;  Ifintelligent notebooks become confused with these calculator derivatives, theywill enjoy a Christmas or two as executive toys at Hammacher-Schlemmer orSharper Image, then be sucked into the vortex of discounting that is consumerelectronics and be unable to maintain the retail pricing needed to pay fortheir higher cost technology.andM;Dull but importantandM;The choice of metaphor for the new product -- be it paper, clipboard,briefcase or computer -- will influence the expectations of customers.andO;Whatever it's called at first, the product will evolve and diversify.andO;Initially, for the first year or two, we think the best product definition isGRiD's.andP;  The GRiD product is being sold as an electronic clipboard, adata-entry device for those who today do their jobs by walking around fillingout forms on a clipboard.andP;  In that regard, the prospects for the product lineare like those of the old MSI Data Corp., which did well for a while, orthose of Telxon.andP;  This isn't a large business, but it can be profitable ifwell managed.andM;The product, the GRiDpad, is heavier than we wish it were and a littleawkward in one's grip when writing while walking or standing, but it seems towork well.andP;  More importantly, although a clipboard may not be what comes tomind when one dreams of computers that can read handwriting, more people workwith clipboards than with briefcases.andP;  Stylus technology seems well suitedfor the mundane but widespread task of filling out forms.andP;  Success here willdepend on careful development of vertical markets.andP;  It may also require closecooperation with companies that already are printing and distributingspecialized forms.andM;Veterans return to warandM;GRiD and other pioneers in stylus computing also may find help in allianceswith companies that automate data-collection and information-managementsystems.andP;  It might be worthwhile, for example, for a company that makeselectronic clipboards to do joint marketing with specialists in medicalinformation systems, sales force automation, or municipal traffic control.andO;Or perhaps there would be an opportunity to work closely with companies thatautomate the process of materials resource planning.andM;As technology, the GRiDpad and its siblings are fascinating.andP;  Both GO andMomenta have attracted executives and engineers who have been involved insuccessful startups before, and the potential opportunity at GO has promotedthree widely-known software wizards -- including the man who thought ofVisiCalc -- to form a software development company for it, known as Slate, inScottsdale, Ariz.andM;Why bears like honeyandM;What will sell stylus systems, however, are their abilities to save time ormoney for the buyer.andP;  And to cost-justify such systems seems astraightforward quantitative task.andP;  Depending on such variables as theaccuracy of the portable systems and the cost of purchase and maintenance, insome cases companies undoubtedly will find it less expensive to provide adigital clipboard to everyone who collects data in the field than to keeppaying an army of clerks in a centralized data-entry department.andP;  Eliminatepaper forms and redirect the responsibility for errors from the data-entrytypist to the field personnel.andP;  Force those who gather the information to getit right.andM;This is hardly a new idea.andP;  A decade ago, Pencept of Waltham, Mass.,andO;developed a technology for reading hand-printed characters, but the companyfailed and was sold.andP;  More recently, Linus Technology of Reston, Va.,andO;developed a portable stylus system, but it was too cumbersome and unreliable.andO;As a ploy to sell more minicomputers, Wang Laboratories developed itsFreeStyle interface, but Wang has too many other problems to improveFreeStyle as it should.andM;The moving finger writesandM;In addition, pointing and digitizing technology is only now becoming adequateto the needs of stylus systems.andP;  Light pens, for example, had too littleresolution.andP;  Today's stylus technologies can offer resolutions of more than200 dots per inch.andP;  Most light pens also had to be used on vertical screens.andO;A user's arm was almost constantly upraised, which produced intolerablefatigue.andP;  On the horizontal surfaces made possible by solidstate displays, astylus is controlled by the same fine-motor muscles used in writing ordrawing with a pencil.andP;  Better control, less fatigue.andM;Talking technologyandM;Eventually, what we'd like to see is a system in which a stylus could writedirectly on the display, or on any other surface.andP;  The digitizing technologyunder development at Polhemus Corp., in Colchester, Vt., may be a harbinger.andO;For now, resistive overlays on the display seem to work well enough forsensing pen positions; problems with drift and recalibration appear undercontrol.andP;  To extend battery life, some electronic notebooks will do withoutrotating magnetic memories.andP;  Other notebooks will dispense with the backlitdisplay that we prefer.andP;  To effectively expand memory, which also drainsbatteries, some stylus-based notebooks will turn to page-descriptionlanguages for data compression.andM;Easy connectivity will be essentially.andP;  For electronic notebooks,connectivity needs create a software opportunity of the sort that TravelingSoftware has exploited in laptops.andP;  Notebook connectivity also raises visionsof docking stations and network plugs, which might be combined withrecharging cables.andP;  One might also connect to a network through radio orinfrared links.andP;  But network distribution of applications software isimpractical.andP;  Which suggests a need for floppy disks.andP;  Or, at the very least,credit-card memory systems based on flash EPROM or battery-backed-up RAM.andM;Learning to readandM;Today's recognition technology is good enough.andP;  Recognizing hand-writtenletters is both more difficult and easier than recognizing the printed word.andO;Printed characters tend to be well-formed, consistent and separated from eachother.andP;  Printed characters, however, are static; handwriting isn't, andobserving the length, direction, velocity, and sequence of the strokes thatcomprise a character as it is being put on paper aids a computer inidentifying it.andP;  Contextual clues are also beneficial.andP;  It halps if thecomputer knows that only numerals may be written in a given field, and it canavail itself of techniques like those used in automated spelling and grammarchecking to help determine the most likely identity of a character.andM;Progress in algorithms and processing power have resulted in accurate,real-time recognition of mixed upper-case and lower-case handwriting -- solong as the characters are printed.andP;  Accurate, real-time recognition ofconnected characters, or cursive writing, is unlikely to be practical formany years.andP;  One reason is that cursive tends to be more idiosyncratic thanprinting.andP;  Also, connections between letters make it difficult for a computerto know where one stops and the next begins.andP;  And, most significantly, adultcursive writing is often decipherable only by context; individual letters arealmost nonexistent.andM;What keeps us awakeandM;If we were investors in a company that made electronic notebooks, one of ourconcerns would involve the company's future products.andP;  Because computersystem prices are constantly declining by 25% to 35% a year, so are amanufacturer's gross margins, in dollars.andP;  The usual strategy is to maintainaverage prices by attempting to sell increasingly complex systems.andP;  But inthe case of electronic notebooks, it's not clear how long such a strategycould be followed.andP;  In addition, our electronic notebook company would alwaysbe fighting it out with clones, knock-offs, and other denizens of thelow-average-selling-price domain.andM;Variations on AdobeandM;But our greater concerns lie elsewhere.andP;  The essential technology inpen-based computing will be proprietary.andP;  (Otherwise, how would anyone make aprofit from it?)andP;  Now, technology can be proprietary without being exclusive.andO;Proprietary technology could open the door to licensing.andP;  Indeed, technologylicensing may be necessary to meet today's high cost of starting a computercompany.andP;  Given that most of the value in stylus computers is added bysystems-level software rather than by hardware, the software and systemarchitecture should have royalty potential.andP;  We'd rather see young companiessell products than technology.andP;  Still, once a technology is developed, theonly additional out-of-pocket cost associated with collecting royalties fromit is the gas to drive to the bank and deposit the check.andM;Licensing the technology would help control the technology, and couldincrease the appeal of stylus computers for software developers by expandingthe potential installed base.andP;  Thus, some companies in stylus computing willwant to follow the Adobe Systems strategy.andP;  Let's hope their royaltyschedules are more flexible.andM;Licensing also could improve market share.andP;  It's possible that if Apple hadlicensed its graphical interface technology when the Macintosh wasintroduced, it might have a much larger market share today.andP;  Its own machinesmight still only account for 20% of the desktops, but it might be collectingroyalties from another 30% to 50%.andM;Another system?andP;  Gee, thanks!andM;But in this era of so-called open systems, proprietary technology raisesseveral issues.andP;  Compatibility, for example.andP;  Should a stylus-based computerrun programs written for the MS-DOS operating system that dominates today'sdesktops, or can it shed such baggage?andP;  With all the confusion about whichoperating system to use, the world would hardly seem to need another.andO;However, DOS is nearly a decade old.andP;  Has no operating system more suited tohandwriting recognition been developed in all that time?andM;Lessons in GRiD and AppleandM;Perhaps, but any company planning to use one would do well to study thehistories of GRid and Apple.andP;  In its corporate infancy in the early 1980s,GRiD's computer was an expensive but well-designed and attractive portable.andO;GRiD almost failed, however, because the computer wasn't IBM compatible, andbecause GRiD tried to sell it for general use.andP;  GRiD began to succeed when itbrought out a compatible system and restricted its sales effort to those whocould not automate their jobs without a portable system.andP;  Compatibility andfocus weren't the only issues, admittedly.andP;  The early GRiD computers weremuch too heavy and too expensive, didn't operate on batteries, and had to beconnected to a network known as GRiD Central.andP;  Still, compatibility wasimportant.andP;  In addition, Apple found that although almost no one really runsDOS programs on a Mac, somehow DOS compatibility was a necessary check-offamong corporate Mac buyers.andM;The Northwest perspective?andM;The moust isn't the ultimate pointing device.andP;  Indeed, whatever a mouse cando, a stylus can do better faster.andP;  Yet even mouse-driven computers come withkeyboards.andP;  We think the most common stylus computers will be designed fordesktop use (that will always be the largest market) and will have keyboards,too.andP;  If so, most of them will need to run the common keyboard software.andO;Which argues for the approach that we expect Microsoft to advocate --operating system compatibility with keyboard-only computers -- and suggeststhat handwriting recognition and other forms of stylus input might best bedone through some sort of window in an otherwise conventional user interface.andM;To succeed with a unique operating system requires compelling applications.andO;Developing one's own operating system is a dangerous course; most companiesthat have followed it have failed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
