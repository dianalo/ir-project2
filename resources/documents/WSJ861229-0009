Last week, the Investment Company Institute unleashed 33 pages of mostly negative comment on the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposal for more complete disclosure in the advertising of mutual fund performance.    Meanwhile, the SEC has asked a federal appeals court in Washington to reconsider its November decision that overturned a rule requiring banks offering brokerage services or products to register with the SEC.    Earlier this year the SEC proposed an advertising code that would, among other things, require fixed-income funds advertising current yield to also advertise a total return figure -- which includes all dividends and distributions -- over several time periods. The code is aimed at providing a standard measurement formula that would enable investors to better compare the performance among the proliferating fixed-income funds. The rules also would eliminate some questionable calculations that seem to throw everything but the kitchen sink into stated yield.    But the ICI feels, in short, that the proposal &quot;tries to cram too much into the ads,&quot; said Matthew Fink, ICI attorney. What's more, the ICI believes the total return approach for fixed-income funds can be misleading. He noted that bond funds, for instance, have had unusually high total return figures in recent years because of the sharp drop in interest rates. So, a fund might have a total return of 30% or more with a current yield of less than 10%.    Still, some industry executives hold that even imperfect guidelines would be better than the willy-nilly calculations going on in some funds. In addition, the ICI and the regulators are pretty much in agreement on a standardized formula for calculating yields.    At the SEC, &quot;We think the suggestions we made are an improvement over present practice,&quot; said Mary Joan Hoene, deputy director of the investment management division.    The agency will review all the comment letters received and &quot;it may be that the comments may change our mind,&quot; Ms. Hoene said. But so far, she said, &quot;We haven't changed one whit.&quot;    Meanwhile, the SEC is trying to rebuild a wall between banking and brokerages that a panel of appeals court judges struck down in November. Specifically, the judges overturned a rule requiring banks that offer brokerage services or products -- including mutual funds -- to register with the SEC.    To put together a spectrum of financial products, some banks have teamed with mutual fund groups. And some mutual funds, eager for more methods of distribution, have been seeking the alliance. Often, the bank's commission comes entirely or largely from a mutual fund charge -- the so-called 12b-1 fee that allows certain marketing costs to be taken from the asset pool.    Last week's request by the SEC for the full-court review of the panel's November decision &quot;kind of puts everything up in the air for a little bit,&quot; said Brian W. Smith, a partner in the New York law firm Stroock andamp; Stroock andamp; Lavan.    The firm, which represents about 110 funds, coordinates links between fund groups, such as Dreyfus Corp., and banks that distribute their products. Usually, the bank receives a continuing payment from the monthly 12b-1 fee, which he said is averaging around 1/2 to 3/4 of a percentage point as well as all or part of an up-front sales charge, or &quot;load,&quot; averaging around 3% to 4%.    ---   K MART HAS NEARLY EVERYTHING: K mart Corp. scrapped plans to &quot;stock&quot; mutual funds. In a pilot program, the nation's No. 2 retailer had been offering funds from American Can Co.'s American Capital unit at a handful of its &quot;Mortgage Place&quot; centers, which provide mortgage services.    But the test got started on the wrong foot by missing the important individual retirement account season last spring.&quot;The timing wasn't the best,&quot; a spokesman for the centers acknowledged. And, since the new tax law eliminates the IRA deduction for many taxpayers, the mutual fund investments &quot;are a less desirable thing from a tax point of view,&quot; he added.    ---   MORE VARIABLES: Registrations covering nine more proposed insurance-related mutual funds were filed in November. Many of the funds would invest the money put up by the buyers of variable life and variable annuities. Those contracts, which function as tax-deferred savings plans, retain their sheltered treatment under the new tax law. Some of the insurance firms seeking to offer the funds are acting as their own investment advisers, and others are subcontracting to mutual fund firms, as the two industries become increasingly symbiotic.    The nine insurance-related fund registrations were among a total of 33 on file with the SEC, including two by funds specializing in arbitrage and two featuring utility stocks, according to Charles E. Simon andamp; Co.    The insurance-related filings are: American Republic Variable Annuity Account, Bankers Security Variable Life Separate Account III, Bankers Security Variable Life Separate Account IV, Lincoln National Pension Variable Annuity Account E, United Services Variable Life Separate Account I, II, III, IV, and NLV Series Fund Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
