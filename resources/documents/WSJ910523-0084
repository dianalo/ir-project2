Dell Telephone Cooperative Inc., an REA borrower in remoteWest Texas, is still &quot;struggling,&quot; its manager says, to keep772 customers in 10,500 square miles of &quot;cactus, rattlesnakesand scorpions&quot; in touch with the Information Age. To hearJune Barker, its assistant manager, tell it, though, she hasa bigger challenge: how to invest the little co-op's mountingpile of cash -- $5.8 million, at last report.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I was trying to keep it local, but there weren't enoughbanks. Now I have two stockbrokers, good ones,&quot; she says.Result: While still paying off $13.9 million in REA loans attaxpayer-subsidized interest rates of 2% and 5%, DellTelephone is ringing up big bucks on high-interest brokereddeposits and mutual funds.   Scores of nonprofit co-ops and family-owned telephonecompanies in rural areas are similarly flush with cash. Inaddition to the subsidy program, they are benefiting from amodern system of pooling telephone-network access charges andlong-distance toll revenues. Many are diversifying intolucrative sidelines, including cable-television andcellular-telephone franchises. One go-go cooperative evenconsidered a plunge into Texas banking.   Lured by the riches, big telephone holding companies areswallowing up many of their plump little country cousins. Inthe past three years, they have taken over more than 50 phonecompanies -- and happily taken on their low-interest REAdebts while going back for more. Last year, $183 million inREA telephone loans, almost half the total, were captured byjust five companies, including four listed on the New YorkStock Exchange.   Telecommunications giant GTE Corp., for example, borrowed$42 million at 5% interest for its Micronesian subsidiary inthe South Pacific -- even though GTE wound up with $431million in cash on hand after paying out $1.1 billion in 1990dividends. The other big borrowers: Alltel Corp., CenturyTelephone Enterprises Inc., Telephone andamp; Data Systems Inc. andPacifiCorp. Meantime, the two-employee Flat Rock MutualTelephone Co. in Flat Rock, Ill., had to wait another yearfor its $428,400 loan, as did other small systems, becausethe REA ran out of 1990 funds.   For many years, the REA had what amounted to a means test,denying or limiting loans to companies and co-ops that hadexcessive &quot;general funds.&quot; But in 1987, industry lobbyistsprevailed on Congress to rescind the policy, forbidding theREA to differentiate between the rich and the poor. Result:Holding-company borrowing surged to last year's $183 millionfrom just $21 million in 1987.   &quot;It's first come, first served,&quot; says Robert Peters, theREA's top telephone lender. &quot;If you're a company withunlimited resources, you normally can get your requests in alot quicker than a Ma-and-Pa type operation.&quot; And REAAdministrator Gary Byrne says the agency hasn't any choice:&quot;By law, we can't treat a GTE subsidiary or an Alltelsubsidiary any differently than a small rural cooperative outin northeastern Montana.&quot;   Bush administration officials decry the subsidization ofbig holding companies and other affluent borrowers as&quot;distorting&quot; the original phone mission of the REA, which wascreated in 1935 to bring electric power to the Americanoutback. Some critics also say the electric subsidies are nolonger needed, particularly in once-rural suburbanized areas.At the very least, administration officials argue, that REAmoney should be meted out on the basis of need, with most ofit going to small fry in rural backwaters that can't obtaincredit elsewhere. But efforts to reinstate the old phonepolicy have failed to win support in Congress.   A major reason, according to former Agriculture Departmentofficial Robert Richards: &quot;No one was willing to go toe totoe with {Rep.} Glenn English.&quot; The Oklahoma Democrat, apower on the House Agriculture and Government Operationscommittees, has received thousands of dollars in campaigncontributions from telephone political-action committees overthe years. Rep. English argues that administration efforts tocurtail lending to wealthy companies and co-ops is asubterfuge for gutting a program that it can't kill outright.He calls REA Administrator Byrne &quot;a wolf in sheep'sclothing.&quot;   Growing competition for credit, coupled with shrinkingpots of loan dollars, is splitting the REA's 1,000 telephoneborrowers into the have-a-lots and the have-nots. Most smallborrowers favor banishing big holding companies from the loanprogram and subjecting cash-rich co-ops and independents tostrict eligibility tests. &quot;It wasn't the intent of Congressto help them make bales of money, and that's been forgottenby some people, including friends of mine,&quot; asserts CliftonGuffey, manager of Wilkes Telephone Membership Corp., a coopin Millers Creek, N.C.   But the four rural telephone groups, despite differencesin their members' interests, have closed ranks against theadministration's assault on &quot;profane profits&quot; at many REAborrowers. John O'Neal, a National Rural Telecom Associationlobbyist, accuses administration &quot;bomb-throwers&quot; of trying toconjure up &quot;perceptions of abuse in a program that has animpeccable record,&quot; unmarred by a single loan default.Holding-company units, he adds, aren't getting &quot;adisproportionate share&quot; of the loans and shouldn't bediscriminated against because of their parentage.   After four decades and $9 billion in direct and guaranteedloans, the communications landscape has changed drastically.All but a few deserts and mountain hollows have been hookedup to the realm of touchtone phones, fax machines andcomputer modems. Moreover, scores of rural companies andco-ops have grown and prospered as suburbs, resorts andretirement communities entered their areas.   But even low-density phone systems are thriving. Underindustry pooling arrangements, systems with the fewestcustomers per line mile can tap the pools for the fattestrevenue shares because they have the highest per-customercosts. A rich revenue stream doesn't deter them from tappingthe REA till, though.   In West Texas, Dell Telephone borrowed $703,000 at 5%interest two years ago to bring radio-telephone service to anisolated reach of the Rio Grande Valley. One new customer: a103-year-old woman rancher. At the time, Dell had a hoard of$5.6 million in cash -- $7,200 per customer.   How does Dell do it, serving a desert domain bigger thanVermont and charging residential customers only $19.40 amonth for local service? &quot;We get money out of the pools anduse that to invest and keep struggling along,&quot; says DaleFlach, its manager. For every $1 in local-service revenue,Dell gets $22 in network-access and long-distance tollrevenue. (Typically in the boondocks, it's $4 long-distancefor every $1 local.) &quot;They could give local service awayfree]&quot; an REA official exclaims.   Nonetheless, Mr. Flach insists Dell isn't ready to beweaned from subsidized credit. &quot;It's desolate out here. IfI'm going to put in new service,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm going to haveto borrow more money from REA.&quot;   Other REA borrowers sound a similar theme. &quot;We'regrass-roots America,&quot; says Lyndell &quot;Pete&quot; Hurt, generalmanager of Craw-Kan Telephone Cooperative Inc., of Girard,Kan. &quot;We operate in a depressed area {along the Missouriborder}. We just want to get our fair share of the crumbsfrom Southwestern Bell and ATandamp;T.&quot;   Some crumbs. After dickering with big carriers over accesscharges and toll revenues, the little co-op wound up 1990with $14.2 million in cash and investments, including $7.4million in banks and thrift institutions from New York toButte, Mont., to Santa Barbara, Calif. &quot;Those Sandamp;Ls have beenpaying good returns,&quot; exults Mr. Hurt.   Few REA borrowers can match Guadalupe Valley TelephoneCooperative Inc., which still owes the government $5.4million, for entrepreneurial verve and grandiose ambition. Ithas flourished without raising its local rate of $7.25 amonth in 18 years, as commuters from growing San Antoniomoved into the goat pastures and live-oak groves in thecentral-Texas Hill Country.   Toll revenues have so enriched Guadalupe that its moneymanagers must be on guard -- against making too much money oninvestments. Otherwise, Guadalupe might, as a co-op, lose itstax-exempt status. At year end, its portfolio included $5.5million in mortgage-backed securities and $3.4 million inbank deposits. To hold down taxable income, the managers put$6.7 million in tax-free bonds and stashed another $3.1million in noninterest-bearing checking accounts.   Tax considerations, however, don't stifle entrepreneurialimpulses at Guadalupe's posh headquarters on a hillsideoutside New Braunfels. The latest plan: Take over a failed$210 million savings and loan, cherry-pick its real-estateassets and leave the duds to the government. &quot;Everything inthe world revolves around finances,&quot; says Guadalupe'spersonable president, Kenneth Brannies. &quot;I think it's a goodtime to get involved.&quot;   George Pratt, deputy REA administrator, offers anotherview: &quot;They had $19 million burning a hole in their pocket.&quot;The notion of an REA borrower becoming a money lenderirritates agency officials, though they can't forbid it.Federal bank regulators can, however, as Mr. Branniesdiscovered. Undaunted, he is lobbying for repeal of a lawbarring corporations from owning large stakes in banks orthrifts.   Meanwhile, Guadalupe's board has a fall-back plan: sharethe wealth with its 15,000 member-customers as never before.Last year, it doled out $3 million in so-called patronagecredits; one customer with multiple access lines reaped an$8,000 windfall. This year will bring a $4.5 million bonanza,which averages out to $300 per customer, more than enough tocover the basic monthly rate. Some people who seldom calllong-distance will dial for free.   Many telecommunications holding companies are faring aswell as Guadalupe, partly because their newly acquiredsubsidiaries remain eligible for REA credit under aonce-a-borrower, always-a-borrower ruling. The last half ofthe 1980s was a period of booming profits for holdingcompanies, an REA analysis shows. Century Telephone's profitsshot up 117% between 1985 and 1989, and Telephone andamp; DataSystems posted a 93% increase. Thanks to REA subsidies, theholding companies, administration officials contend, aredraining dollars out of rural America while saving onborrowing costs. In 1989 alone, the companies collected $439million in dividends from their rural subsidiaries. GTE'sContel Corp. unit took $70 million out of a large Californiasubsidiary.   &quot;For every dollar we send to Main Street, these holdingcompanies take $2.40 {in dividends} back to Wall Street,&quot; REAAdministrator Bryne complains.   Holding-company officials deny converting REA dollars intodividends; they say they're using them to improve servicewithout big rate increases. &quot;It's our obligation to providetelephone service at the lowest possible cost,&quot; says AnthonyHamilton, a GTE spokesman. &quot;Therefore, we utilize REA loanswherever the circumstances justify.&quot;   So far this fiscal year, big holding companies alreadyhave applied for half the money in the $364 million REA loanpot, which is $51 million smaller than in fiscal 1990. Mostof the money is for direct loans at 5% -- appreciably lessthan the government's own borrowing cost. Companies also canseek guaranteed loans at 8.5% interest, but nobody does.&quot;They refuse to take guaranteed money,&quot; the REA's Mr. Prattsays. &quot;Would you at 8.5% when you can get direct loans at 5%?They can wait until their turn comes in the queue.&quot;   But while many smaller REA borrowers clamor to restrictthe big and the rich, some people abhor the notion of a meanstest -- and denounce any ban on holding -- company borrowing.&quot;There's no reason why rural customers of Century should bediscriminated against,&quot; asserts Stewart Ewing, chieffinancial officer for Century, based in Monroe, La., whichled all borrowers last year with $82.6 million. &quot;The cost of10 miles of cable is the same for Century as it is foranybody else.&quot;   The REA-loan beneficiaries aren't the borrowers but thecustomers, adds the United States Telephone Association, thebig companies' lobby. Recently, the USTA, a powerful ally ofthe rural phone lobbies, entertained lawmakers and top aidesat the tony Virginia Gold Cup steeplechase, pouring out thechampagne beneath a sundappled tent after the running of theU.S. Telephone Cup race.   One suggested compromise that some holding companies maybe willing to accept: Dispense with the once-a-borrower,always-a-borrower rule and go back to the original REAguideline: Funds can be borrowed only to serve a communitywith a population of less than 1,500.   &quot;We should be considered ahead of the big boys, simplybecause of our limited {profit} margins,&quot; says BenjaminVigil, manager of La Jicarita Rural Telephone Cooperative,which serves Mora County, N.M., one of the nation's poorestregions. &quot;REA stands for rural,&quot; he says. &quot;It isn't being runas it was meant to be.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
