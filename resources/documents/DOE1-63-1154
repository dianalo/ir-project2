The authors use high volumes of naturalgas in our plants. At present they are involved in a combined potentialtransportation volume for six of our larger steel plants of approximately160 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The authors' subsidiaries,Marathon and Texas Oil and Gas, produce natural gas. The author is infavor of Order 436 and of any law or regulation which will contributeto make the existing surplus of natural gas glow freely from the producersto the consumers in a system of competition, of fair play, without unduediscrimination towards any of the parties involved in the industry. Heis in favor of rate design based on actual costs of service rendered.He is in favor of paying for services actually received, that is to say,he feels that rates should be unbundled. In short, the author and U.S.Steel have always believed, and continue to believe, that the free enterprisesystem, allowing the free play of the marketplace forces in lawful competition,to be the best of all alternatives available in today's economic world.</TEXT></DOC>
