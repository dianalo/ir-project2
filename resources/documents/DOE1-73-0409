<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-73-0409 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new method for the molecular dynamics simulation of bulk planar interfacesat high temperatures is presented. The method uses the basic Parrinallo-Rahman(constant stress) scheme modified, however, for the application to inhomogeneoussystems. Since our computational cell contains only one interface with2-d periodic boundary conditions we are able to study isolated interfacesall the way up to melting. The interaction between boundaries which maylead to their annihilation at higher temperatures, which is a problemwhen 3-d periodic boundaries are applied, is thus avoided. As an application,the method is used to study the stability of a grain boundary at hightemperatures. Observations on a possible connection between grain boundarymigration and ``premelting'' are discussed. 5 refs., 15 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
