Indonesia's plan to move people to its lightly populated outer islands faces budgetary and environmental pressures.    World Bank President Barber Conable acknowledged in a letter to the Washington-based Environmental Defense Fund that the Indonesian government has reduced the 1986-87 resettlement goal to 36,000 families from 100,000, and that preparations for future homesites, mostly in nonforested areas, will be cut to 125,000 homes from 300,000.    This is the first indication from the World Bank that the huge project is being drastically modified. World Bank aides acknowledged that these target cutbacks &quot;inevitably&quot; will result in corresponding reductions in World Bank funding.    The World Bank so far has committed $600 million for transmigration-related projects, including $160 million that had been tagged for the 1986-87 phase. The cutbacks would affect 1986-87 loans as well as previous loans that still are being drawn down.    Sen. Robert Kasten (R., Wis.), the leading congressional critic of Indonesia's transmigration program, said Mr. Conable's statement is &quot;a step forward, but more needs to be done.&quot; He charged that the program has resulted in &quot;tremendous devastation&quot; of rain forests in many resettlement sites.    Indonesian Embassy spokesman Didi Ratman confirmed that, mainly because of &quot;budgetary reasons,&quot; Jakarta is cutting back on the program, but he wouldn't specify the size of the cut. Indonesia, a major oil producer that has been severely hurt by falling oil prices, had to reduce its entire 1986-87 development budget by 22% from the year before.    In addition, the Indonesian forestry agency has acknowledged that the destruction of forests is a serious matter.    According to official Indonesian statistics, the program has already resettled one million families, or 4.3 million people, mainly from the densely populated central island of Java, to the outer provinces of Sumatra, Sulawesi, Kalimantan and Irian Jaya.    The World Bank finances only 6% of the resettlement program's total cost, but is crucial to its success in other ways. The bank provides technical advice and coordinates financing from other donors.    In his letter to the Environmental Defense Fund, Mr. Conable said the World Bank has urged the Indonesian government to &quot;lower targets&quot; and &quot;promote environmental protection.&quot; But he said the U.S. environmental lobby's demand for a total halt of forest clearing would be &quot;unreasonable&quot; in a country as densely populated as Indonesia, the world's fifth most-populous nation.    Mr. Ratman said his government has no choice but to maintain the program within its resources. &quot;Some 60% of our population of 165 million is concentrated in Java,&quot; he says. &quot;Many of those people have to find other places to live.&quot;    Bruce Rich, the Environmental Defense Fund's senior counsel, said Mr. Conable's statement &quot;meets the concerns of most environmental groups at least halfway.&quot; Mr. Conable was responding to an Oct. 10th letter sent by the defense fund, the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society and other groups. </TEXT></DOC>
