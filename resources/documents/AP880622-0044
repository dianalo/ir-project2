Gorbachev to keep him on center stage inthe international arena.   There was considerable praise for Reagan in Toronto, most of itin the form of a personal tribute. In his best aw-shucks manner,Reagan admitted he would miss the glitter and ceremony ``in a way.''   With only seven months to go, and a long summer vacation ahead,Reagan is entering lame-duck status and his foreign policyobjectives are nearing a dead end.   Negotiations with the Soviet Union to sharply reduce long-rangenuclear weapons have encountered problems with verification and theKremlin's continued objections to his search for a space-baseddefense against ballistic missiles.   But talks are continuing in Geneva, and neither Reagan norGorbachev has ruled out the possibility of a fifth superpowersummit if a deal is struck. Most analysts, however, believe thechances of that happening are remote.   In the Middle East, where Reagan's economic summit partnerscalled for a peace conference, his envoy, Secretary of State GeorgeP. Shultz, has been unable to nudge Jordan's King Hussein andIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to the negotiating table.   On Reagan's agenda in the coming months are vacations at hisCalifornia ranch in both July and August and campaign forays onbehalf of his vice president, George Bush.   And so for Reagan, the three-day Toronto meeting might just behis last hurrah.   ``The summit punctuated the success of the president's economicprogram over the last seven years,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the WhiteHouse spokesman, enthused in a windup statement.   The facts, however, suggested a more mixed performance.   For instance, Reagan's proposal to end all agriculturalsubsidies by the year 2000 fell on deaf ears.   France's Socialist President Francois Mitterrand challengedReagan's unfettered faith in the free market. And on helpingdebt-ridden countries, the best Reagan could manage was acompromise formula that really was no decision at all.   And then there were those persistent Washington reporters whopeppered Reagan with questions at a pre-departure news conferenceabout a spreading Pentagon bribery investigation and theIran-Contra affair.   These are not the kind of topics Reagan likes to discuss _ athome or away.   In fact, Reagan fielded only a few questions about the economicmeeting.   He did receive a rousing tribute from the summit host, CanadianPrime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Reagan's closest ally, PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. But even that was temperedby Mitterrand.   ``For someone who played a great role in contemporary history,it's normal to salute him and wish that his retirement be happy andlong,'' the French president said. ``It's a courtesy. It hasnothing to do, I suppose, with politics.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid is head of the AP's StateDepartment staff.</TEXT></DOC>
