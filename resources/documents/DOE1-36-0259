Prior to capture into the synchronous rotationresonance, a narrow attitude-unstable chaotic zone is entered and thesatellite begins to tumble chaotically. It is noted that enhanced dissipationof energy during the chaotic-tumbling phase may effect the orbital evolution.The theory suggests that, eventually, the rotation stays close to oneof the accessible attitude-stable islands long enough for the weak tidaltorque to remove the satellite from the chaotic zone. 26 references.</TEXT></DOC>
