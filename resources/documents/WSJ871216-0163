The field test was completed late Monday east of San Francisco in a Brentwood, Calif., strawberry field where environmentalists earlier this year tore out plants to protest the microbe's first experimental release.    The company said that results of the test, which is expected to take four months, will be used in registration of the product with the Environmental Protection Agency. Company officials said they hope to have the product on the market in two to three years.    As reported earlier this week, Advanced Genetic Sciences has agreed to merge into DNA Plant Technology Corp. of Cinnaminson, N.J., in a stock swap valued at about $36.6 million. </TEXT></DOC>
