Two-particle correlation functions suggest thatemission occurs from a region which is slightly larger than observedfor /sup 14/N-induced reactions at E/A = 35 MeV, but significantly smallerthan for /sup 40/Ar-induced reactions at E/A = 60 MeV. In contrast, therelative populations of widely separated particle unbound states arefound to be surprisingly independent of incident energy and projectilemass.</TEXT></DOC>
