The Senate voted 93-5 Friday to approve the accord banningintermediate-range nuclear missiles, far more than the two-thirdsmajority required by the Constitution.   When Majority Leader Robert Byrd and Minority Leader Bob Dolecalled Reagan in Helsinki, Finland, to tell him the news, thepresident invited them to treaty ceremonies in Moscow next weekduring his summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.They accepted on the spot.   The treaty documents themselves were to be taken to Reagan byWhite House chief of staff Howard Baker, who was leaving Washingtontoday. Byrd and Dole were to leave Sunday for Wednesday'sceremonial exchange of ratification papers between the two heads ofstate.   ``We are very pleased to be able to give you this in advance ofyour stepping on Soviet territory,'' Dole, R-Kan., told thepresident.   ``We'll have a little blue ribbon tied around it,'' added Byrd,D-W.Va.   ``This is really America's treaty,'' said Dole, who added thatthe lopsided vote reflected the will of all Americans to reduce thenuclear threat.   Reagan, in a statement, welcomed the action. But he added, ``Icontinue to have concerns about the constitutionality of someprovisions'' added to the resolution of ratification by the Senate.   That appeared to be a reference to a provision added by Byrdthat sharply restricts the executive branch's future ability tochange its interpretation of treaty provisions. Byrd claimed theaddition made the Senate and the White House ``equal partners'' intreaty making.   The provision stems from a dispute between the Senate and theadministration over White House efforts to redefine the 1972U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to allow greater latitudefor testing of Reagan's Star Wars missile defense program.   Passage of the treaty _ the first such act since the ABM treatywas approved 16 years ago _ gave cause for optimism to those whosee the relatively modest INF accord as paving the way for a moreambitious treaty making deep cuts in the two sides' arsenals oflong-range nuclear missiles.   ``We are making a breakthrough,'' said Senate Majority Whip AlanCranston, D-Calif. ``It is not a substantively significant treaty.... But it lays the foundation'' for future treaties ``that cansubstantially reduce the scale, cost and dangers of this armsrace.''   Senators voting against the treaty were Republicans Jesse Helmsof North Carolina, Steve Symms of Idaho, Gordon Humphrey of NewHampshire and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Democrat ErnestHollings of South Carolina.   Humphrey, a staunch conservative, called the treaty ``PresidentReagan's most serious foreign policy mistake'' because it wouldweaken allied defense of Western Europe while having little effecton the Soviet threat.   ``I believe the Senate has served the country poorly by lettingitself be caught up in summit fever,'' he said.   Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, did notvote. Biden is recuperating from surgery. Glenn missed the votebecause of the death of his mother-in -law.   The INF treaty, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev in Washington onDec. 8, requires the elimination within three years of all nuclearmissiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles, and would resultin the destruction of 867 U.S. missiles in Europe and 1,752 Sovietmissiles.</TEXT></DOC>
