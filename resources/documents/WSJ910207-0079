The agreement is subject to approval by California Gov.Pete Wilson and by federal and state courts here. A Unocalspokesman here declined to confirm terms of the settlement,saying: &quot;There are some formalities we are still working on.It would be premature to comment.&quot;   Atlantic Richfield Co., one of the original defendants,settled with California in 1984 for $22.5 million. Arcodenied any wrongdoing and said it settled the case only toavoid adding to its legal expenses, which it put at $20million.   The remaining defendants in the case are Standard Oil Co.of California, now part of Chevron Corp.; Texaco Inc.; MobilCorp.; Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co. unit; andExxon Corp. All have denied violating antitrust laws.   The suit, originally filed in federal court in June 1975,sought a judgment of between $750 million and $1 billion. Thesame plaintiffs filed a suit in 1986 in state court coveringa different time period and seeking at least $1.05 billion indamages.   The trial in the federal case is scheduled to start inJune; the state case is still in the pretrial hearings stage.Unocal's settlement covers both cases.
