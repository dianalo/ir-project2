REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government's efforts to reboundafter the recent failed coup have largely consisted of rhetoric,partly because of a political system designed to check presidentialaction.   It is widely assumed that President Corazon Aquino must makesweeping changes in her administration and leadership style if thenation is to recover from the political, economic and social damagecaused by the Dec. 1-9 military mutiny that nearly ousted her.   More than a week after the last rebel surrendered, there havebeen no Cabinet changes. She seems to have delayed action so itdoes not appear that she bowed to the mutineers' demands forchange, including an end to government corruption and inefficiency.   There also have been no major domestic policy reforms. But thePhilippine political system, which Mrs. Aquino proudly describes asa ``restored democracy,'' is not designed for speedy action.   It was designed to divide power among the executive, legislativeand judicial branches after 20 years of strongman rule under thelate President Ferdinand Marcos. For better or worse, the Aquinoadministration and citizens are discovering what that means in timeof crisis.   In a bid to restore public confidence, Mrs. Aquino declared astate of national emergency on Dec. 6. The declaration exists inname only, however, because Congress has not ratified the finalversion of a bill spelling out what Ms. Aquino would be empoweredto do during a state of emergency.   The Senate and House of Representatives planned to take up thelegislation on Monday.   It would grant few new powers beyond price controls, stateoperation of public utilities and recovery of ``loose firearms.''   Congress amended the original proposal to require adherence tothe constitution, language that virtually guarantees courtchallenges if the legislation passes.   For example, the compromise bill would not allow the governmentto arrest suspects without warrants or circumvent other legalrestraints. Lawmakers also have weakened proposed curbs on theright to strike and media reporting.   The idea of emergency powers has been severely criticized bypeople with bitter memories of martial law, which Marcos imposedfrom 1972 until 1981.   ``We see a repeat of the Marcos regime,'' wrote columnist NealCruz in the Philippine Daily Globe. ``Marcos refused to heedappeals for reform. Instead, he declared a state of emergency, thenimposed martial law. ... Now that housewife is turning out to beanother Marcos.''   In the heady days after the 1986 ``people power revolution''that toppled the Marcos administration, Mrs. Aquino appointed acommission to draft a new constitution to guarantee no moreone-person rule.   The commission restored the two-house legislature preciselybecause Marcos had been successful in transforming a single-houseNational Assembly into a rubber-stamp chamber.   Last week, the system seemed to work: Congress refused to givethe administration everything it wanted.   The president is constitutionally empowered to declare a stateof emergency ``and under reasonable terms ... temporarily take overor direct the operations of any privately owned public utility orbusiness affected by the public interest.'' No other specificpowers are cited.   Even if she declared martial law, Mrs. Aquino would hardly havea free legal hand.   The constitution stipulates that martial law ``does not suspendthe operation of the constitution'' or the operations of Congressand the courts.   Mrs Aquino could order arrest without warrants for 60 days butCongress is empowered to overrule such a decree after 48 hours.   One step that she could take would be to dismiss her Cabinet,which had been widely criticized as ineffective months before thecoup attempt.   Presidential staff sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,say Mrs. Aquino was preparing to drop some Cabinet members but didnot plan a massive shake-up because she believes much of thecriticism is unfair.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Robert Reid has been The Associated Press bureauchief in Manila since September 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
