Box 96456, room 2525-S, Washington, DC 20090-6456; telephone:(202) 475-3918.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule is issued under MarketingAgreement and Marketing Order No. 905, both as amended (7 CFR part 905),regulating the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelosgrown in Florida. This order is effective under the Agricultural MarketingAgreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referredto as the Act.This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein.Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this action on small entities.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation underthe marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelosgrown in Florida. In addition, there are about 13,000 orange, grapefruit,tangerine, and tangelo producers in Florida. Small agricultural producershave been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.2) asthose having average annual gross revenues for the last three years ofless than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined asthose whose gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A minorityof these handlers and a majority of the producers may be classified assmall entities.Marketing Order No. 905 was amended on September 8, 1989, (54 FR 37290).Under that amendment, andSection;andSection; 905.9 and 905.52 were changedto classify Canada and Mexico as export markets to better meet the needsof buyers in those markets. Before the amendment, Canada and Mexico, alongwith the United States, were defined as the domestic market, and currenthandling regulations under the order were issued on that basis. The marketingorder provides for different requirements for domestic and export shipments.Minimum grade and size requirements are now in effect for several varietiesof fresh Florida oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos under andSection;905.306 of the order. Paragraph (a) of that section specifies the requirementsfor shipments to domestic market (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Paragraph(b) specifies the requirements for all other shipments (exports). Thisaction amends andSection; 905.306, so all Florida citrus fruit shipped toCanada and Mexico is regulated under paragraph (b) as exports, rather thanunder paragraph (a) as domestic shipments. Section 905.9 of the order wasamended by changing the term ``continental United States'' to ``contiguous48 States and the District of Columbia of the United States''. This changeis incorporated in andSection; 905.306. Some minor, non-substantive changesare also made for clarity.This action will enable Florida citrus handlers to ship fruit to Canadaand Mexico which meets the grade and size requirements for export shipmentsin conformance with the recent order amendment. Canada is an importantmarket for Florida grapefruit, and this action will enable handlers toship smaller sized grapefruit to Canada, which is in demand in that country.Section 905.400 of the rules and regulations contains provisions whichinterpret the provisions of paragraph (d) in andSection; 905.52. These provisionspertain to fruit incidentally packed as part of a lot for export when shippingholiday regulations are in effect for domestic shipments. Since the orderamendment changed paragraph (d) in andSection; 905.52 by deleting the referenceto Canada and Mexico, this rule will make a corresponding changes in andSection;905.400, as well as several minor, non-substantive changes for clarity.Both andSection;andSection; 905.306 and 905.400 are effective on a continuingbasis subject to change, suspension, or termination by the Secretary.The Department's view is that the impact of this action upon handlers andproducers will be beneficial because it will enable handlers to providefruit consistent with the demand conditions in the domestic and exportmarkets. Acceptable grades and sizes of Florida citrus fruit have beenshipped to fresh markets over the past several years because handling requirementshave been in effect under the marketing order.Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.After consideration of all relevant matter presented and other availableinformation, it is found that this rule will tend to effectuate the declaredpolicy of the Act.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon goodcause, it is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interestto give notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good causeexists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 daysafter publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> because: (1) This action changes the handlingrequirements for Florida citrus to conform with the recently amended marketingorder; (2) Florida citrus growers approved the order amendment which classifiedCanada and Mexico as export markets; (3) a majority of the Florida citrushandlers have signed the amended marketing agreement; (4) the 1989-90 Floridacitrus shipping season began in early September, and the handling regulationsshould be changed as soon as possible to be of maximum benefit to the industry;and (5) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments receivedwill be considered prior to issuance of a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 905</ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, Florida, grapefruit, oranges, tangelos,tangerines.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 905 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="56"> PART 905_ORANGES, GRAPEFRUIT, TANGERINES, AND TANGELOS GROWN IN FLORIDA</ITAG>1.
