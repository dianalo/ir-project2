BTR Acquisition is a unit of BTR PLC, a London-based maker of industrial parts. As previously reported, BTR last month began a tender offer for all shares outstanding of Stewart-Warner, a Chicago-based maker of electronic and fabricated metal products and hardware. The offer, which expired Friday, had an indicated value of about $177 million.    BTR said shares tendered in connection with the offer, together with a 17% stake previously acquired, represent about 89% of Stewart-Warner's common outstanding. BTR said it plans to exercise an option, granted by Stewart-Warner, to buy about an additional 1.2 million shares, giving it about 90% of the common. Stewart-Warner shares closed unchanged at $32.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
