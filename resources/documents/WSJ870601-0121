The Fed's unanimous decision puts additional pressure on House lawmakers to act on a Senate-passed ban on new limited-service banks. The proposed curb, opposed by the Reagan administration, is supported by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.    The ruling allows Chemical Trust Co. of Florida, a Palm Beach-based subsidiary of Chemical New York, to accept deposits and make consumer loans. Chemical Trust has operated since 1982 as a federally chartered trust company, offering fiduciary, custody and agency services and investment advice.    Limited-service banks take deposits or make commercial loans, but don't do both. In that way, they don't fit the legal definition of a bank and aren't subject to the restrictions placed upon full-service banks.    Since February 1985, a court order has barred the Comptroller of the Currency from granting charters to any new limited-service banks. In October, though, a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled that the Fed could approve applications from institutions that already hold charters.    In March, the Senate approved a wide-ranging banking bill that included provisions prohibiting the establishment of new limited-service banks, effective March 5, 1987. In its decision, the Fed notes that &quot;it may be required by subsequent Congressional action to limit the activities of&quot; Chemical Trust.    The House Banking Committee is sharply divided on whether its members should even discuss the ban in a House-Senate conference committee without first holding hearings and asking the full House to vote on the matter. The panel is to meet Thursday to discuss the issue.    The Fed approved Chemical New York's application despite a 1984 Florida law prohibiting bank holding companies from owning limited-service banks in the state. In a 15-page appendix to its decision, the Fed argued that the state law is unconstitutional because it infringes on interstate commerce. But the Fed acknowledged that &quot;the ultimate resolution of this issue is a proper function of the courts.&quot;    Richard Simmons, Chemical New York's vice chairman, said the company was &quot;gratified&quot; by the decision. &quot;We look forward to offering Florida consumers a wider variety of banking services, including both loans and deposit products,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
