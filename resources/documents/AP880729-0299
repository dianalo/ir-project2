Inc. wouldconcern few holders of other high-risk corporate bonds.   Revco, which announced its filing Thursday, is the only majorcompany to seek protection from its creditors after going privatein a junk-bond financed buyout.   ``Many people had expected it (the Chapter 11 filing),'' saidRobert Waill, managing director and junk bond analyst at L.F.Rothschild andamp; Co. in New York. ``There had been a generalunderstanding from investors that this was risky ...''   The Twinsburg, Ohio-based company failed to make a June interestpayment on about $700 million in outstanding debt that was used togo private 19 months ago. The company sought protection fromcreditors after talks with bondholders broke down.   ``There was no ripple effect,'' said Robert Levine, director ofhigh-yield bond research for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in New York.   As a result, traders said, prices of most junk bonds remainedfairly firm in the secondary market Friday, including some ofRevco's securities.   Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk notes commonly issued tofund leveraged buyouts and other types of corporate takeovers. In aleveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed fundsthat are repaid with the company's cash flow or sale of its assets.   Some traders and analysts even predicted that Revco bonds mightrebound after the chain files its reoganization plan with thebankruptcy court and gets back on its feet financially.   All of Revco's debt had been considered speculative grade, or``junk,'' a category assigned by the big credit-rating services forcompanies considered more likely to default on their bonds due to avariety of reasons, including tough economic conditions in aparticular industry.   Junk bond yields are generally three- to four percentage pointshigher than comparable Treasury bonds to compensate for their lowrating, making them attractive to some investors.   The majority of junk bond buyers are large sophisticatedinstitutional investors, rather than individuals, who diversifytheir portfolios enough to compensate for future risks.   Revco's problem resulted from the heavy debt load incurred as aresult of its leveraged buyout in December 1986. The company listedits total debt as $1.5 billion in the bankruptcy filing.   Chairman Boake A. Sells said Thursday that the company'sinvestment adviser planned to propose a recapitalization that wouldhave swapped equity in Revco for debt, but he said discussions withmajor bondholders broke down even before the plan was proposed.   Sells maintained that most of Revco's 2,000 drug stores wereprofitable but that the company was not generating enough cash toboth operate its business and make millions of dollars in annualinterset payments.   Revco is the only leveraged buyout company that has failed tomeet its obligations to bondholders, according to Gail I. Hessol, amanaging director of Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   In all of 1987 there was a record $9 billion in corporatedefaults, she said. As of June 21, there were $2 billion indefaults.   Waill said as a result of the Revco filing, ``I don't thinkpeople would say that this teaches us a lesson (that) we should bemore careful of LBOs.''   ``Investors tend to look at this as an isolated, separate eventwhich was determined by its own particulars,'' he said. ``Unlikehigh-grade bonds, each of these (junk bond) companies lives its ownlife.''</TEXT></DOC>
