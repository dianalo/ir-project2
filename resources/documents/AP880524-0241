Senate leaders, trying to spare Reagan the embarrassment ofmeeting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev without a ratifiedtreaty, announced plans to cut off debate on the accord, which bansintermediate-range nuclear missiles.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which Reagan andGorbachev signed Dec. 8, seems assured of approval by anoverwhelming majority, but has been stalled by a handful ofopponents.   After a speech Wednesday morning on the South Grounds of theWhite House, Reagan will fly to Helsinki, Finland, arriving in thepre-dawn hours Thursday.   He will remain there until Sunday morning, when he boards AirForce One to travel to Moscow. It will be the first visit to theSoviet Union for the 77-year-old Reagan and will mark the firsttime in 14 years that an American president has visited Moscow.   Almost immediately after his arrival, Reagan and Gorbachev willbegin talks, their fourth summit in 30 months.   In a speech broadcast to Europe on Tuesday, Reagan said U.S.relations with Moscow must be guided by realism.   ``We do not expect a quick, radical transformation of the Sovietsystem,'' he said. ``We do not expect to turn a corner one day tofind that all our problems have gone away because our adversary hasbeen transformed. There still remain profound political and moraldifferences between the Soviet system and our own.''   He hailed the Soviets for progress on human rights, specificallyin terms of the release of political and religious prisoners, anincrease in emigration, resolution of cases of divided families andseparated spouses, and an easing of censorship.   ``Yet, despite this progress, the human rights situation in theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe is far from good,'' Reagan added.He cited a string of problems, including restraints on religion,peaceful demonstrations, freedom of movement and unofficialpublications.   The president's remarks were broadcast overseas on the U.S.Information Agency's ``Worldnet'' satellite service. The speech wastaped Monday in the Oval Office.   The arms treaty, which crowned Reagan's summit with Gorbachev inWashington last December, was endorsed Monday by the SupremeSoviet, the nominal parliament.   Toning down summit expectations, Assistant Secretary of StateRozanne Ridgway told reporters Tuesday, ``Don't look at this summitin terms of its potential for drama or breakthroughs but rather itsessence is that of continuity.''   However, she said the summit outcome ``isn't pre-cooked andnever has been with these two leaders.''   Gorbachev said in an interview published this week in TheWashington Post and Newsweek magazine that he would proposeU.S.-Soviet cooperation on an unmanned flight to Mars. However,Ridgway said sucha project would involve technology transfer issues``that need very careful examination.''   She said that although the Soviets may propose it officially,``I would not expect the United States side to be in a position torespond at this time.''   In addition to three minor arms agreements, she said there wouldbe documents to sign on cultural programs, fishing, civiliannuclear reactor safety, transportation technologies and a packet ofunderstandings on Coast Guard-maritime issues.   Amid other summit preparations Tuesday, Reagan gave an interviewto five European journalists. He also conferred with his ForeignIntelligence Advisory Board on arms control strategy and briefedhis Cabinet on the summit agenda.   Reagan also met at the White House with Democratic andRepublican leaders of Congress, and got assurances the Senateprobably would ratify the INF pact in time for him to exchangeratification documents with Gorbachev in Moscow.   ``While we should never place artificial deadlines on matters ofpolicy and national security, the time has come for promptaction,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.   He said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told Reaganthat ``in all likelihood, the Senate will be able to act on thetreaty by Friday.''   Howard Baker, the White House chief of staff, will stay behindin Washington when Reagan leaves to follow the Senate debate on thetreaty, which calls for the elimination over three years of nuclearmissiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.   ``I asked the president's consent to stay here while the treatyis still before the Senate,'' Baker said Tuesday in an interview onthe CBS Evening News.   ``I hope to take ratification documents to the president inMoscow.''   The spokesman said Baker will travel to Moscow on Saturday andbe on hand when Reagan lands the next day.   Reagan, in his speech, was silent on the race for ratificationof the treaty. He said, however, he hoped that before he leavesoffice he can conclude an even more ambitious agreement withGorbachev to reduce strategic nuclear weapons.   However, he said, ``it is the requirements of a good treaty andnot some arbitrary deadline that will determine the timetable.''   Fitzwater said Reagan was looking forward to the journey,particularly his meetings with Soviet writers, artists, filmmakers,dissidents, refuseniks and others.   ``He thinks he has an important message about freedom anddemocracy for them and he thinks it's also helpful to encouragethem as they seek more freedoms under the glasnost policies,''Fitzwater said.</TEXT></DOC>
