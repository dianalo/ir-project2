One bank official estimated the loss at 40 million dollars on a pretax basis. The trader responsible for the loss has been suspended but hasn't been fired, pending completion of an internal investigation. The trader wasn't identified.    The loss apparently resulted from a bond-trading strategy that went wrong. Jean Turmel, the bank's executive vice president of treasury, said in an interview from New York that &quot;we were short bonds.&quot;    Short selling involves the sale of borrowed securities by an investor who hopes to profit by buying the same securities later at a lower price to replace the borrowed securities.    In New York, bond traders said that earlier this week a large bank rushed in to cover a short position on a huge amount of five-year U.S. Treasury notes.    Without giving details, Mr. Turmel confirmed that &quot;this was the kind of position we were in. . . . The position was discovered on Monday and we liquidated all week.&quot;    The traders say the National Bank trader may have been betting that bond prices would decline due to an anticipated rise in interest rates. But interest rates actually declined and bond prices have been strong, forcing the bank to replace the securities at much higher prices.    Mr. Turmel said that the employee, one of fewer than 20 in the bank's New York treasury operation, &quot;exceeded his (trading) latitude and he hid that fact.&quot; Mr. Turmel said it still isn't known when the trading began.    When rumors of the trading loss emerged earlier this week, the bank acknowledged a problem but minimized its size. The bank, Canada's sixth largest, has assets of about 30 billion dollars.    In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, National Bank closed at 9.75 dollars, down 75 cents.    The bank said the charge will be reported in the quarter ended Jan. 31. A year earlier, the bank earned 49.8 million dollars, or 43 cents a share.    Roy Palmer, a banking analyst with Alfred Bunting andamp; Co., Montreal, said that despite the effect on the quarter, the charge &quot;isn't of devastating proportions for the year&quot; as a whole.    Last month, the bank predicted 10% to 15% growth in per-share operating profit for the year ending Oct. 31. Last year, the bank had operating profit of 214.4 million dollars, or 1.85 dollars a share, but a charge of 298 million dollars on reserves for loans to less-developed countries resulted in a loss of 83.6 million dollars.    In its 1987 annual report, the bank lauded the results of the treasury division's U.S. operations, singling out the New York office and praising &quot;the hard work and expertise of its personnel.&quot;    Says Mr. Turmel: &quot;We had only one bad apple.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
