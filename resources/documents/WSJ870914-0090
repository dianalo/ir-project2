Levine, who settled insider-trading charges for $11.5 million, may yet have to pay the government additional money to meet his massive tax bill.    Barry R. Goldsmith, a Securities and Exchange Commission staff attorney, told a federal judge Friday that the SEC never intended that Mr. Levine should be allowed to pay his $8.5 million in unpaid taxes out of the illegal stock profits he surrendered last year. (With interest, that Levine fund currently holds almost $12 million.) Mr. Goldsmith said the Internal Revenue Service must stand in line with any other potential claimants to the money, such as allegedly defrauded investors.    Mr. Levine is a 35-year-old investment banker now in prison whose arrest on insider-trading charges last year led to the downfall of stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and several others.    The SEC's statements came at a hearing at which U.S. District Judge Richard Owen agreed to rule later on the tax dispute, as well as on an SEC motion to combine the surrendered-profits funds of Mr. Levine and three other defendants. The other defendants are individuals who settled charges that they gave Mr. Levine inside information or traded on it.    Mr. Goldsmith said the SEC plans to file a proposed plan for dividing the money by Nov. 14. He said the SEC is considering whether to take out newspaper advertisements to alert potential claimants to the available funds. He emphasized: &quot;The funds were not set up to go to pay (the defendants') tax liabilities.&quot;    But Martin Flumenbaum, Mr. Levine's attorney, and attorneys for the other defendants said they understand otherwise -- and they fear that in any case the process of seeking out allegedly defrauded investors will hinder efforts to pay the tax bills. Judge Owen, too, noted that it &quot;may be utterly impossible&quot; to identify precisely which investors are entitled to part of the defendants' &quot;ill-gotten gains.&quot;    The SEC says such identifications can be accomplished. </TEXT></DOC>
