North was placed on probation Thursday forillegally using a tax-exempt foundation to raise donations for theNicaraguan rebels.   Richard R. Miller was sentenced on his 1987 guilty plea toconspiracy to defraud the Treasury by using a tax-exempt foundationto raise $3.2 million for the non-deductible purpose of buyingarmaments for the Contras.   U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris placed Miller on two-years'probation and ordered him to perform 120 hours of community service.   Harris, noting that Miller had already suffered many adversitiesas a result of his guilty plea, said ``I need not impose more forjustice to be served.''   Miller, who cooperated with independent counsel Lawrence E.Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair, could have beensentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to $250,000.   ``I let my guard down. It may have been blind patriotism, butthat's no excuse,'' Miller told Harris. Helping the Contras ``was acause that meant everything to me and in that fervor I turned ablind eye to the excesses of others and I crossed the line myself.''   Prosecutors made no sentencing recommendation, but noted in courtpleadings that Miller had cooperated with their investigation of theprivate foundation that raised some $10 million for the Contras whenU.S. military aid was banned by Congress.   After the sentencing, associate independent counsel David Zornowsaid Miller ``came forward at a very early stage of theinvestigation to admit his wrongdoing, pleaded guilty to a veryserious charge and agreed to cooperate with the government.''   ``He lived up to his agreement with the government,'' Zornowsaid. ``This closes the chapter on Mr. Miller.''   Miller and Carl R. ``Spitz'' Channell, who is scheduled to besentenced Friday for his guilty plea to the same tax conspiracycharge, both testified that North was part of the conspiracy toraise money through the tax-exempt National Endowment for thePreservation of Liberty.   North was acquitted of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury thatconvicted him trying to cover up the Iran-Contra affair andaccepting a home security system.   On Wednesday, North was fined $150,000, placed on two-years'probation and ordered to perform 1200 hours of community service.   Miller, who raised money and helped move it to off-shore bankaccounts for distribution to the Contras, testified that North lethim take a 10 percent of the money he handled as his cut.   Alluding to North's sentence, defense attorney Earl C. Dudley Jr.said imprisoning Miller would be unfair because of the treatment ofothers more seriusly involved in the Iran-Contra affair.   In another reference to North, Dudley said that during thelengthy investigations of the Iran-Contra affair, Miller ``neveronce turned to a paper shredder, he never once turned to the optionof lying.''   Miller is the third person to be sentenced for his involvement inthe Iran-Contra affair.   Former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane was placed onprobation on March 3 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor chargesof withholding information from Congress about the secretarms-supply network.   Still pending are cases against John W. Poindexter, McFarlane'ssuccessor as national security advise,r who is awaiting trial onfelony charges of obstructing Congress and making false statements.   Also awaiting trial are arms dealers Richard V. Secord and AlbertHakim, who are charged with conspiring to pay illegal gratuities toNorth.   They are accused of arranging to install a $13,800 securitysystem outside North's house and setting up a $200,000 Swiss bankaccount for North's family.   Former CIA agent Joseph F. Fernandez is scheduled to stand trialJuly 24 on charges he lied to the CIA and the presidentialcommission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair about his rolesetting up an airstrip on Costa Rica for the arms resupply operation.   No trial dates have been set for Poindexter and Hakim. Secord'strial is tentatively set for Nov. 13.</TEXT></DOC>
