<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0003 </DOCNO><TEXT>The geometry and topology of two-dimensional grain structures have beenanalyzed for different conditions of nucleation and growth to impingement.These conditions include simultaneous nucleation at a fixed number ofsites and continuous nucleation at a constant rate per unit of untransformedarea. Intermediate between these cases are conditions in which the nucleationrate declines with time. Another set of conditions are those in whichnucleation is excluded in a zone surrounding each pre-existing grain.The modelling is intended for study of the nucleation and growth conditionsfor thin films of metals or semiconductors.</TEXT></DOC>
