The staff has evaluatedeach of the licensees' revised commitments and has found them acceptable.Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would resultin no significant radiological environmental impact.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 21, 1989 (54 FR 11598). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe license involves revisions to commitments for resolution of HEDs resultingfrom the detailed control room design review. It does not affect nonradiologicalplant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commissionconcludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impactsassociated with the proposed amendment.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no signifiant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to operation of the PerryNuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, dated August 1982.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensees' request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated February 10, 1989 which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC and at the Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 26th day of June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John N.
