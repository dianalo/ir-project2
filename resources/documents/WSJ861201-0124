But Germany's Social Democrats have been working on an ominous version of East-West diplomacy that's worth a second look.    The cause for concern is an agreement signed recently by opposition leaders in West Germany and leaders from the very-much-in-power Communist Party in East Germany. The two groups produced a statement supporting a 186-mile-wide &quot;nuclear-free&quot; corridor along the border of the two Germanys, to be cleared, theoretically, if the SPD ever returns to government. The corridor accord follows on a similar agreement -- that once was even called a draft &quot;treaty&quot; -- to make a chemical-weapon-free zone of the two Germanys.    The SPD argues that such a brash preemption of the center-right government's turf is justified for the security in Europe. Party theorists say such measures supplement past work at Reykjavik and coming work in Geneva. It's true that the SPD's policies aren't as radical as those of Britain's Labor Party, which is calling for removal of U.S. nuclear bases from British soil. But the SPD's goals are more sinister -- the party is using its residual legitimacy to hoist itself onto the geopolitical stage. With the latest party-to-party statement the SPD makes itself at home in a role it has been moving toward for years -- accomplice to Moscow.    Under the new agreement, all Western nuclear weapons would be withdrawn from the 93-mile-wide area between the German-German border and the line that runs from the port of Cuxhaven to Munich. In East Germany, such weapons would be removed from the 93-mile-area west of a line drawn from Stralsund to Dresden. The corridor would extend to Czechoslovakia as well. Ultimately, the SPD hopes to create a nuclear-free stripe down the European map from Norway and Sweden to Austria.    Now, Pershings, cruise missiles and Soviet SS-20s aren't stationed in the area at hand. So the pact doesn't attack the most important pieces in the deterrence chessboard. But it would govern so-called &quot;dual-use&quot; weapons -- weapons that could be used to deploy nuclear arms. Much of the artillery stationed at the border falls into that category. A nuclear-free corridor would hurt West Germany's &quot;forward defense&quot; by removing the nuclear uncertainty the Warsaw Pact now faces in contemplating an invasion with conventional arms. The SPD deal, moreover, encumbers legitimate negotiators in the arms arena.    The concept of a nuclear-arms-free corridor also has frightening political implications for West Germany. Ever since Helmut Schmidt departed the Social Democratic leadership following the fall of his government in 1982, the SPD has been listing dangerously leftward. Its pietistic candidate for chancellor, Johannes Rau, concerns himself primarily with domestic issues, leaving Nebenaussenpolitik -- the SPD's special name for its &quot;extra foreign policy&quot; -- to the harder core.    Moscow's part in the SPD's efforts also has been unabashed. A framed picture of Mr. Gorbachev and SPD leaders hangs on Social Democrats' office walls, a map with a legend in Cyrillic hangs in the SPD corridors, and one negotiator can boast that he's met Mr. Gorbachev three times.    The chance that the West could find itself dealing with an SPD government in January is a slim one. But the long-term danger is more worrying. Mr. Rau's loser candidacy -- although he's popular, this election is likely to yield new lows for the SPD -- means that West Germany may soon know an SPD without his moderate profile. Where the party will go isn't clear, but as it gets more desperate, many are betting it will get more radical. That might further reduce its popularity, but having such a party waiting in the wings, and perhaps prepared to align itself with even more radical groups, is not a small worry for West Europeans. </TEXT></DOC>
