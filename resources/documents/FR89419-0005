This Ad requires inspection of the electrical power leads to theengine fire extinguishers to determine proper installation and to correctthe installation, if necessary. This action is prompted by reports of incorrectinstallation of the electrical power leads to the engine fire extinguishingsystems. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a fire bottlebeing discharged into the wrong nacelle.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 8, 1989.This AD was effective earlier to all recipients of Priority Letter AD 89-05-05,dated March 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information may be obtainedfrom Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, Technical Operations Department,Travis Field, P.O.

That action was prompted by six reportsof the electrical power leads to the engine fire extinguishing systemsfound incorrectly installed (crossed) on various Gulfstream airplanes inservice. Such an incorrect installation could cause a fire bottle to bedischarged into the wrong nacelle.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthis same type design, this AD requires a one-time inspection of the electricalpower leads to the engine fire extinguishers to determine proper installationand to correct the installation, if necessary. This is considered interimaction until final action has been identified, at which time the FAA mayconsider further rulemaking to address it.Since a situation existed, and still exists, that requires immediate adoptionof this regulation, it is found that notice and public procedure hereonare impracticable, and good cause exists for making this amendment effectivein less than 30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The Federal Aviation Administration has determined that this regulationis an emergency regulation and that it is not considered to be major underExecutive Order 12291. It is impracticable for the agency to follow theprocedures of Order 12291 with respect to this rule since the rule mustbe issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. It hasbeen further determined that this document involves an emergency regulationunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979). If this action is subsequently determined to involve a significant/majorregulation, a final regulatory evaluation or analysis, as appropriate,will be prepared and placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluationor analysis is not required).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
