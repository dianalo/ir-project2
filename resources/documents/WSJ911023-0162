Bankers Trust's performance came despite a drop in netinterest revenue from its lending activities. Third-quarterearnings advanced 9% over the year-earlier period on thestrength of trading activities and the sale ofrisk-management products to corporations.

It also cited trading gains forhelping to boost its earnings.   Most analysts were expecting Bankers Trust to reportper-share profit of about $1.71, and Mellon to post net of 95cents a share. Buoyed in part by the higher-than-anticipatedearnings, both banks' shares rose yesterday. Bankers Trustwas quoted at $63.625, up 37.5 cents a share, while Mellonwas quoted at $35.375, up 75 cents, in late New York StockExchange composite trading.   Marine Midland, a Buffalo, N.Y., regional banking unit ofHSBC Holding PLC, the holding company for Hongkong andamp; ShanghaiBanking Corp., continued to be plagued by real estate andcommercial loan problems. It reported a loss of $56.9 millioncompared with a loss of $111.5 million a year ago.                                                                                                          Bankers Trust                                                                                                          The bank attributed the increased earnings primarily togrowth in revenue from trading of fixed-income securities anddeveloping-country debt and sales of derivatives, which arefinancial products that help corporate customers hedge oravoid risks in interest rates, foreign currencies orcommodities. Trading account revenue climbed 94% to $283million from $146 million a year earlier.   Revenue from foreign exchange trading fell 66% to $40million from $118 million. Some of that decline, however,stems from the shift of a portion of the foreign exchangetrading to the bank's fiduciary and funds managementbusiness, the bank said. Revenue there rose nearly 20% to$146 million from $122 million.   Net interest revenue declined 14% to $170 million from$198 million as the bank, in a strategic move to reduce itsloan holding activities, decreased the amount of interestbearing assets on its books. As well, the revenue declineresulted from the bank's move toward increased trading ofequities that don't bear interest, but for accountingpurposes are included in the net interest category.   Operating expenses rose 4% to $185 million from $170million a year ago, but the rate of growth slowed comparedwith 5% in the second quarter and 23% in the fourth quarterof 1990. The bank attributed the slowdown in expenses tocost-cutting measures.   Separately, the bank said its Bankers Trust Co. ofCalifornia subsidiary agreed to sell its San Francisco unitto First Bank Systems Inc. The unit provides corporate trustservices for California municipal bond issuers.   As of Sept. 30, the bank had assets of $62.67 billioncompared with $63.59 billion at the end of the 1990 fourthquarter.                                                                                                          Mellon Bank                                                                                                          The bank benefited from a large securities gain and steadyrevenue growth in feebased businesses. Asset quality,particularly in the bank's real estate portfolio, also showedsigns of stabilizing.   Pittsburgh-based Mellon used the quarter to shore upcredit provisions, adding $80 million to reserves comparedwith year-ago provision of $45 million. The bank said it wasconcerned about the sluggish U.S. economy.   The increased provision was offset by a $38 million gainfrom the sale of investment securities. Mellon also posted a12% increase in service-fee revenue.   Mellon continued to improve its net interest revenue, asthe bank's acquisitions of higher-yielding credit-cardportfolios have given it a more profitable mix of assets.Mellon's net interest margin for the quarter was 3.84%compared with 3.40% in the year-ago quarter.   Nonperforming real estate assets, including bad loans andreal estate acquired net of reserves, were $724 million, anincrease of only $7 million from June 30. Overall, assets notearning income increased $25 million from the previousquarter, to $932 million. The third-quarter increase was duelargely to one customer, as Mellon added to non-accrualstatus $44 million in loans to Columbia Gas System Inc.,which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection inJuly.                                                                                                          Marine Midland                                                                                                          Losses narrowed in the third quarter for the regional bankas it set aside lower provisions for possible loan losses.Provisions were $47.7 million compared with $172 million inthe year-earlier quarter.   Net interest income declined 15% to $163.2 million from$192.6 million while operating expenses rose 17% to $257.4million from $220.9 million. Total assets declined to $16.94billion as of Sept. 30 from $23.62 billion in the same perioda year ago.   Hurt by problems with real estate and commercial loans,the bank recently reorganized its business lines, hoping tofocus more on consumer banking in the Buffalo region. It isthe second foreign-based banking unit to report a loss thisweek, following National Westminster Bancorp Inc., a unit ofLondon-based National Westminster Bank PLC, which reported aloss of $65.7 million.   ---                            1991             1990                         in      per      in      per    %                      millions  share  millions  share  chg.
