The aim of the literature-researchcarried out for this report was to make the original scenarios more recognizable,and to find out which groups could be expected to support them. The conceptsof control bear the names 'Dynamic and growth', 'Dirigation and blockbuilding'and 'Shared development'. They can be seen, so is argued, as competingperspectives on a so-called 'post-Fordist' world. The three conceptsof control differ on what they see as common interests and the way theyshould be looked after. Topics in the description are: the desired rateof European political and economical integration, the borders of Europe,Europe's position in the world, the acceptance of new technologies, thegoals they should be used for, and perceived relationships between energy,environment and economy. The scenarios show what happens if these threeconcepts of control become hegemonic without being forced to compromises.For all three scenarios a short sketch is given of the correspondingdominating energy- and environmental policy and of future relationshipswithin OECD and between OECD on the one hand and NIC's/LDC's on the other.The conclusion of the report is that the ideological differences betweenthe neoliberalism of 'Dynamic and growth' and the green, direct-democracy-politicsof 'Shared development' are not as big as they were in the seventies.Especially on the new policy-areas like technology, energy and environmentthey get closer. But this does not mean that the concept of 'Dirigationand blockbuilding' can be put completely aside. Its goal of economicequality and its emphasis on government dirigation may become more attractiveagain if it comes out that market regulation leads to a dual societyand that it was state-intervention (by environmental legislation) thatcreated the market for environmental technologies. 43 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
