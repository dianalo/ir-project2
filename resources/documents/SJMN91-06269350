She also tries to getveteran workers out of their cars through articles in the company newsletteror magazine.;   The effort was just one of the requirements NUMMI had to meetto install a new truck assembly line at its plant along Interstate 880. SinceNUMMI will need 700 new workers for the line, the city of Fremont ordered thecompany to take some steps to lessen traffic congestion.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Weekly  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PANEL STUDIES TRAFFICSTUDY PROPOSES ALTERNATIVES TO CARS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Educating employees; But beginning next year, Girard will be required toeducate all employees about alternatives to solo commuting. So will allcompanies in Alameda County with more than 100 employees.;   It's all part ofa new plan to do something about traffic. When state voters approved a new gastax in 1990, they did so with a caveat: Counties could only get the money ifthey made a serious effort to manage gridlock.;   So every county in the stateset up a Congestion Management Agency. Alameda County's 26-member group, madeup of elected officials, will be among the few agencies to take a broad lookat congestion and how to reduce it. But it won't just be educating peopleabout commute alternatives. It will also be examining local developments todetermine if they will affect traffic.;   &quot;In the best of all worlds, theCongestion Management Agency is going to allow you to predict the impact ofgrowth and development,&quot; said William Hein, the deputy director of theMetropolitan Transportation Commission, which is coordinating the regionalplans.;   Hearing planned; The Alameda County CMA is still in its formativestage, but has just prepared a comprehensive plan. The CMA will hold a hearingon the plan Thursday. To reduce congestion, the CMA proposes to:;   (check)Promote alternatives to the single automobile. By October 1992, all companieswith more than 100 employees will have to tell workers about carpooling andrapid transit and encourage them to use it. By Oct. 1993, all companies withmore than 50 employees will have to do the same. Each Alameda County city willbe required to make sure the companies comply. If the cities don't, they mightnot get their share of the $9 million the county gets from gas tax each year.;  (check) Examine the impact of development on regional traffic. The citieswill be required to inform the CMA every time a developer has a project largeenough to create 100 more car trips during peak afternoon hours, the timetraffic is the worst. The cities also will notify the agency when someoneapplies for a general plan amendment. Every three months, CMA will look at allthe plans to determine how they affect traffic. If cities don't notify theagency, they can lose their gas tax funds.;   (check) Approve all new roadsthat require state or federal dollars. From now on, all projects must be on aCMA &quot;master list&quot; to get those funds.;   It remains to be seen how these newrequirement will help Alameda County's traffic congestion. But the executivedirector is confident that, with time, the answer will become clear.;   &quot;It'sa brand new program,&quot; Dennis Fay said. &quot;It hasn't jelled in our minds. Thebottom line is, until we actually live with this, we're not going to know whatto do to make it work right.&quot;;   Others are not sure if the CMA will help --or hinder -- the situation.;   &quot;There are so many agencies now who have someinput into transportation planning and who have their fingers in the fundingand regulatory pots,&quot; said Dave Nesmith, conservation director of the SanFrancisco Bay Chapter of the Sierra Club. &quot;It's bewildering. It's difficultfor us to tell which agencies are the 'juice' agencies and where we shouldfocus our interest.&quot;; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Congestion Management Agencywill hold a public hearing on its plan at 3:30 p.m. Thursday at theMetroCenter, 101 Eighth St., Oakland.
