In an unusual move, the court announced it will reconsider the precedent when it re-examines a North Carolina job-discrimination case next term. The five justices raised the issue on their own, without being asked by lawyers in the case or by the Justice Department.    The action -- taken by the three Reagan appointees, the chief justice promoted by Mr. Reagan and one other justice -- provoked concerns both on the court and outside it that the Reagan-era high court is overstepping its role and that it might be preparing to weaken a major civil-rights law of the post-Civil War era.    That 1866 law requires that all citizens be able to make and enforce contracts in the same manner as white citizens. It is still widely used in suits alleging job, housing and other discrimination. Although later laws offer additional protection against such bias, including actions by private companies, the 1866 law is often favored because it provides extra benefits such as a jury trial and compensatory and punitive damages.    Brenda Patterson, a black accounting clerk who was laid off her job at a credit union, used the statute in the North Carolina case to sue her employer for alleged racial harassment.    No questions about the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling were raised in the North Carolina case. In the 1976 decision, the court ruled 7-2 in favor of two black children shut out of a private Virginia school, saying that the law protects against discrimination in private contracts. The two justices who dissented -- Byron White and William Rehnquist, now chief justice -- took advantage of the court's new alignment to reopen the issue yesterday. They were joined by Sandra O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, all appointed by Mr. Reagan.    In sharply worded dissents, four justices accused the others of undermining minorities' faith in the nation's civil rights protections and of fashioning their &quot;own agenda&quot; of issues. &quot;The court has inflicted a serious -- and unwise -- wound upon itself today,&quot; wrote Justice John Paul Stevens, who was joined by William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun.    In an unsigned explanation, the majority said it isn't unusual to order new arguments in a pending case in order to reconsider a precedent; they cited four instances in the past 20 years. In addition, they said, the court several times has ultimately overruled its own decisions interpreting statutes.    &quot;There is the fear,&quot; said William Robinson, director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights under Law, &quot;that this new Reagan majority is now moving to reconsider and perhaps overturn basic Supreme Court precedent providing protection against invidious racial discrimination.&quot;    William Bradford Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, said that the court's action surprised him and that it is too early to say how the government will urge the court to rule. In a brief filed in the North Carolina case, government lawyers themselves had cited the 1976 ruling as precedent. Mr. Reynolds, who has been accused by civil rights groups of trying to restrict anti-bias laws, cautioned against leaping to the conclusion that the justices who voted to re-examine the ruling will ultimately vote to change it.    But civil rights organizations were clearly worried that the court may be on the threshold of limiting the 1866 law's power to fighting only discrimination by government, instead of actions by private parties as well. Counting just those cases charging job discrimination, &quot;there are literally thousands of potential cases a year&quot; that rely on the law, said Barry Goldstein, attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.    Other Cases   --The justices agreed to examine a claim by an Exxon Corp. unit that it is owed $19.5 million from a 1981 oil deal. The high court will decide whether a federal appeals court was wrong to keep Exxon from collecting on a letter of credit that officially expired before Exxon's business partner defaulted on the deal. Exxon wants the court to follow a state court ruling in a similar case that would enforce payment of the letter of credit.    --A group of former asbestos manufacturers failed to persuade the court to hear arguments that they were wrongly denied use of a pretrial defense in a New Jersey suit involving hundreds of injury claims. The justices, without comment, left intact a ruling that refused to let the manufacturers present evidence that they were unaware of asbestos hazards when they sold their products 30 to 40 years ago. The high court has refused to hear numerous asbestos-related appeals.    --The justices, without comment, refused to disturb a federal appellate ruling that spared Westinghouse Electric Corp. from paying $83 million to dispose of spent nuclear fuel at the Turkey Point power plants of FPL Group Inc.'s Florida Power andamp; Light Co. unit. The utility claimed Westinghouse reneged on a 1966 waste-disposal contract. </TEXT></DOC>
