(EBI), offering integrated fax-mail andcontact-management features.andP;  This announcement followed the recent releaseof a faster version of the Macintosh-based Leads from Endpoint MarketingInformation Systems and the announcement by accounting-software developerSourceMate Information Systems Inc. of its E-Power contact manager.andM;EBI is striving to distinguish itself by integrating automated, mass fax-mailcapabilities with the usual contact-management features, such as calltracking and appointment scheduling, according to John Pratt, owner of theNorcross, Ga., company.andM;&quot;I tell my customers that `junk faxing' doesn't work,&quot; Pratt said.andP;  &quot;Faxesshould only be sent after a phone conversation.&quot;andM;PC Sales Assistant lets users track phone calls and prospect information.andO;The follow-up work is done by automatic faxing.andP;  After sales representativesmake the initial phone contact with a prospect, they assign codes that directthe software to automatically and periodically fax sales documents to theprospect.andM;In addition, the software, which runs on DOS and requires a fax board, haslabeling, reporting and letter-writing capabilities.andP;  It is priced at $295,or $495 with a fax board.andM;For Macintosh users, Endpoint last month shipped a new version of its Leadscontact-management software that performs twice as fast as and takes up 50percent less RAM than the earlier version, according to officials at theSunnyvale, Calif., company.andP;  Leads 1.1 now runs on a minimum of 1M byte ofRAM.andM;&quot;The RAM requirements are less of an issue than speed,&quot; said Steve Hall, anearly Leads 1.1.andP;  user and network administrator at Avid Technology Inc., aBurlington, Mass., video-editing technology company.andM;&quot;Leads is written in andlsqb;Acius'andrsqb; 4th Dimension, which is generally not as faston the network as andlsqb;Nantucket Corp.'sandrsqb; Clipper.andP;  But other programs for theMac, and there aren't that many, look too IBMish,&quot; he said.andM;Leads 1.1, priced at $1,795, with discounts for volume purchases, alsoincludes new analysis features that allow reports to be generated from anysubset of records of sales leads in the system database.andM;For companies that want tighter integration between their sales force andtheir &quot;back room&quot; systems -- accounting and bookkeeping programs, for example-- SourceMate plans to ship later this month a new version of SalesBridge,which it acquired from Contact Technology.andM;The new version, to be called E-Power, is designed to allow users to hot-keyback and forth between the contact-management software and SourceMate'sAccountMate sales order entry module, said Ben Tse, president of the MillValley, Calif., firm.andM;SourceMate's E-Power will be priced at $495 for single users and $995 for amultiuser version.andM;SourceMate can be reached at (415) 381-1011; Endpoint can be contacted at(408) 737-3831; and EBI is at (404) 368-7121.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
