(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Mainstream Muscle As 1990 winds down, we can look back on a big year in thePC marketplace.andP;  Memory prices went down, 80486 systems began to appear inquantity, hard disks got bigger, faster, and cheaper, and Microsoft Windows3.0 gave us all a reason to want more in--and from--our PCs.andP;  No wonder,then, that this was the year that saw the 33-MHz 386 taking over as themainstream power machine, leaving 486 systems to make their mark as veryhigh-end engineering, scientific, and graphics-intensive workstations.andM;The demand for 33-MHz 386 PCs seems confirmed by the sheer number of vendorsselling these systems.andP;  It seems that there are more machines at this levelthan at any other in the PC hierarchy.andP;  In this issue, we take a look at 45computers with 33-MHz 386 brains.andP;  If you think that's an impressive figure,you'll really be astonished to find that it doesn't begin to include all the33-MHz 386 systems in existence.andP;  In the October 31, 1989 issue, we covered22 computers in this class, and in the February 13, 1990 issue, we reviewedanother batch of 22.andP;  None of the machines represented in those tworeviewsare included in this roundup--that means you can ponder yet another 45machines before you buy.andP;  (Watch for a near-future issue examining the 33-MHz386s that have been significantly updated by their manufacturers since theOctober and February reviews.)andM;REVIEW CRITERIAandM;Add to the above list two machines from well-known manufacturers that werenot included n this round-up.andP;  Tandy failed to get an evaluation unit to usbefore our deadline, and Arche sent a machine that was too different from thetest specification--a 150MB hard disk, 4MB of RAM, a 64K RAM cache, onefloppy drive, and DOS 3.3 or 4.0--to be included.andP;  We made allowances onlyfor minor variations from the requested specification--for instance, machinesthat came in with hard disks ranging from 120MB to 200MB, or those that camewith smaller RAM caches were fit for inclusion.andM;The final list included systems from ACMA, AGI, ARC, Argo, ACT, BitwiseDesigns, Blue Star, Brain, BSI, CAF, Clone, CompuAdd, Computer Marketplace,Core, CSR, DEC, Dynamic Decisions, EPS, Everest, Fortron, GRid, Hertz,Hyundai, Insight, Master Computer, Matrix, Memorex, Micro Telesis, Mitsuba,MultiMicro, Novacor, Peregrine, Premier, PSG, Quill, SAI, Swan, Tandon,Tatung, Televideo, Tenex, Texas Micro Systems, Transource, Unisys, and Wang.andM;BUYING DECISIONSandM;In the crownded PC field, the 16- and 20MHZ SX models own the entry-levellayers, and the 486 systems get bragging rights for having the msottechnically advanced processor.andP;  But unless you rely on applications that canmake use of the 486 chip's built-in math coprocessor capabilities, such asthe ones mentioned earlier, or unless you must have the latest and greatestdesign around, you'll find that the 33-MHz 386 gives you the most bang foryour buck.andP;  (See the sidebar &quot;The 386-33: Today's Best Buy.&quot;)andM;The wide range of 386/33 machines available leads to a buyer's dilemma: whatcriteria do you use for selecting one system out of almost 100?andP;  It would bea mistake to use the systems' results on our benchmark tests as your onlyguide--we found that one 33-MHz 386 machine performs pretty much the same asthe other 33-MHz 386 machines.andP;  Aside from a few stragglers at the bottom ofthe pack, there was less than a 10 percent difference on the 80386Instruction Mix test results between the slower machines reviewed here andtheir faster counterparts.andP;  Interestingly, these fast systems, which wetested with BIOS shadowing turned on, didn't do drastically better on thistest than the 386/33s reviewed without BIOS shadowing enabled in our pervioustwo roundups.andP;  The best score here was 1.59; compare that to the 1.63 and1.61 Instruction Mix times racked up by machines in the October and Februaryreviews, respectively.andM;Among the systems reviewed here, there were more significant differences inthe hard disk and video times, but since those results are at least asdependent on the components used as they are on the motherboard design, youcan generally increase performance by opting for better parts.andP;  A traditionalST-506 MFM drive was sufficient for older 8088 and 80286 systems, but a386/33 can support faster components.andP;  ESDI, SCSI, and IDE interfaces are inuse among these machines, with ESDI being the most popular.andP;  Additionally,part of the CompuAdd machine's integral design is its disk controller withcache memory--a factor that no doubt played a large part in the system'sexcellent performance on our PC Labs' Disk Benchmark test.andM;All the 33-MHz 386s reviewed in this issue, and in the two previous, boasteda processor RAM cache, usually 32K or 64K.andP;  The system cache speedsperformance by storing information in fast static RAM, so the CPU rarely hasto wait for a refresh cycle before fetching information from memory.andP;  Thisdesign is typically behind a vendor's claim of &quot;zero wait state&quot; operation.andO;Perhaps not surprisingly, the three top performers reviewed here boated 64Kcaches; the three slowest, only 32K--again, though, the spread is so slightthat you shouldn't make your purchase based solely on these numbers.andM;The PC marketplace, and the 33-MHz 386 arena in particular, has become socrowded that a competitive price is almost assumed as a given requirement bythe buyers--of course, the definition of a competitive price varies dependingon whether you're speaking about a brand name product versus a clone, or aretail product versus a direct-marketed machine.andP;  Your decisions will mostlikely be based on factors such as what you plan to do with the system, thevendor's warranty and support, and the extras included.andM;Determining the use to which the system will be put is the first step.andP;  The33-MHz 386 that you want to use as a file server for your network certainlyhas different memory and storage expansion requirements than does the machinedestined to run large spreadsheets, or the one to be used for stand-alonedatabase applications.andP;  Most mail-order vendors stand ready with an a lacarte approach, offering you a zillion possible combinations of differentcases, hard drives, displays, and memory configurations.andP;  Some other vendorsare more inflexible in their offerings, with only a few hard disk optionsdefining your choices.andP;  Your job is to make certain that you can get yoursystem outfitted with the mix of components that you need.andM;Many vendors today seek to differentiate their products through servicefeatures; this is as true of the 33-MHz 386 as it is of most products in acompany's line.andP;  Some offer free technical support as long as you own thecomputer; others provide 24-hour-a-day phone support.andP;  May use either theirown dedicated electronic bulletin board system (BBS) or a national servicesuch as CompuServe to post technical information and answer common questions.andO;Of course, there are still those who offer little or no technical supportservices--in these cases you typically trade support for lower prices.andM;Repair policies also vary widely.andP;  Some vendors still require that you shipthe machine back to them for repair, but many have discovered that buyerswant faster and more convenient service.andP;  As a result, you will find moreon-site service contracts bundled with systems, or provisions for shippingyou parts overnight without waiting for the broken component to be received.andM;THE WINDOWS EDGEandM;Many of these vendors seek an edge by bundling more goodies with theirsystems than the competition.andP;  In the past, this has been limited toutilities such as backup and video programs, and the odd piece of hardwarelike a mouse that comes with the display adapter card.andP;  With last summer'srelease of Windows 3.0, however, the field has changed.andP;  Microsoft has madeit nearly irresistible to 386/33 vendors to bundle Windows; but the carch isthat Microsoft makes it part of the deal that the program be bundled with allthe vendor's machines of that model.andM;Some vendors have taken Microsoft's deal and made it even better for thebuyer.andP;  Since the Windows bundle includes DOS and a mouse as well, somevendors opt to install DOS and Windows on the hard disk.andP;  With the systemconfigured for you, all you have to do is take the machine out of itsshipping cart and plug it in.andP;  You'll be up and running in record time.andP;  Thebest part of the Windows deal is that some vendors offer it at pricescomparable to systems that don't include it.andM;Finally, the documentation delivered with a PC can be an important element inthe decision-making process.andP;  The only ones who won't care so much aboutwell-written documentation are the experienced power users familiar with theinsides of PCs in general--people who have no qualms about identifying videocards and hard disk cable attachments just by looking inside.andP;  However, thereare many users out there who, however experienced they may be with software,get lost when it comes to troubleshooting poorly documented hardware.andP;  As the386/33 moves forward into the mainstream market, it's going to be showing upon the desks of a lot more of the less-savvy users--people who will benefitfrom the extra effort made by vendors who don't just throw in a collection ofpamphlets provided by the manufacturers of components like the motherhood,I/O card, video adapter, disk controller, and hard disk.andP;  If a stack of straypapers filled with technobabble doesn't intimidate you or the users you buyfor, then you may get away with spending a lot less money.andP;  If it does, thenyour real savings may come by investing in a well-documented machine in thefirst place.andP;  As a general rule, the bigger the vendor, the better documentedthe system.andM;Whether you opt for an inexpensive machine that doesn't have a lot of serviceoptions or come with complete documentation, or you prefer a system with theworks, rest assured that you will be picking a PC that makes sense as thepractical business system in today's market.andP;  In less than a year and a half,386/33 systems have gone from being an expensive hotshot rarity to anaffordable and commonplace workhorse ready to churn out your tasks.andP;  Nolonger an extravagance, this is the level of machine to pick if you need fullpower in a business computer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
