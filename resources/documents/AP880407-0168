(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The stakes in the afternoon bingo gamesweren't exactly high: 75 cents for the first win and a candy barfor the second. But senior citizen centers here have called themoff because they're illegal.   Marianne O'Neil, coordinator of the La Crosse Committee onAging, blew the whistle on the unlicensed games.   ``I can't understand it,'' said Irene Beguin, director of theHarry J. Olson Senior Center. ``Nobody can. We've played bingo for25 years. The center's been in operation for 25 years.''   O'Neil, who runs a less-popular variation of bingo on Sundaysinvolving food prizes and called ``prizo,'' said she felt she hadto report the weekday games.   ``I thought I was doing my duty,'' she said Wednesday. ``It isillegal, as you are well aware, to advertise bingo and to play forcash without a license.''   O'Neil wrote a letter to La Crosse County District AttorneyScott Horne March 11 informing him of the games. Horne responded toO'Neil's letter on March 22, agreeing that a license is needed.O'Neil forwarded Horne's letter to the senior centers.   A license costs $10 for each bingo session, plus $10 in annualfees, according to Roxanne Peterson, one of the bingo control boardmembers with the state office in Madison.   But center officials say the games barely break even, so thestate fees would be too much to pay.   ``It's not the kind of activity that any prosecutor's office orpolice agency is going to go out and make arrests for,'' Horne saidin an interview Wednesday.   ``Clearly something can be worked out that could make thislegal, although at this time, technically, it is illegal,'' he said.   ``Two weeks ago we quit,'' said Wesley Vollenweider, presidentof the South Side Senior Citizen Center. ``We don't want to get introuble or get fined.''</TEXT></DOC>
