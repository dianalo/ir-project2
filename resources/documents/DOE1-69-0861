Since that time, further work has led to substantial enhancementsand IPSA has been adopted by a number of organisations, in the UK andoverseas, for power system planning, design and to a more limited extentfor system operation and training purposes. This paper describes workcarried out to develop the necessary interactive graphic and computingfacilities for the operational environment in distribution systems. Thishas involved the development of a graphics capability to handle operationalsystem diagrams, an interactive pattern which can permit convenient switchingoperations and an underlying program structure and algorithms which arecapable of processing the large, detailed networks involved in distributionsystem operation activities. It was clearly desirable to retain the successfuluser interface of the IPSA package. The same interactive pattern has,therefore, been maintained with the required new facilities incorporated,as far as possible, in the form of additional &quot;options&quot;.</TEXT></DOC>
