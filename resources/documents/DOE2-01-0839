Natural gas consumption has decreaseddramatically since the peak year of 1981 when an annual average of about1300 million cubic feet per day was used compared to 1986 consumptionof 750 million cubic feet per day. This resulted from a concerted programof adding alternate fuel capability plus a large quantity of cogenerationcapacity built in the authors service area. The reduction of gas dependenceis deceptive since the cogeneration is nearly all gas fired. Includingcogeneration, the total dependence on the natural gas market is stillnearly 65%, the equivalent of 1200 million cubic feet per day. The positionas one of the largest gas consumers in the nation located at the heartof the natural gas pipeline system gives insight into the risks inherentin the gas market which may be of interest to other utilities. Six yearsago, a discussion of gas market risk would have evoked concern only aboutthe risk of curtailment and long-term security of supply. The focus shiftedabout three years ago to the risk that high gas prices might be disallowedby the regulatory authority. This gas market risk is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
