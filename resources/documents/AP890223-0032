The speech by Chris Heunis, substituting for ailing PresidentP.W. Botha, came a week after three members of the governingNational Party quit Parliament because of links to unrelatedscandals.   In the ensuing three weeks, one of those men has gone to prisonfor electoral fraud, and a former member of Botha's Cabinet wasdescribed by an inquiry commission as unfit to hold any office.   This week, 10 education and development officials were suspendedfor alleged financial misconduct and the Cabinet minister whooversees them was criticized for incompetence.   A separate, ongoing inquiry is examining the affairs of AlbertVermaas, a Pretoria businessman suspected of foreign exchangeirregularities. Vermaas has entertained senior government officialsat his home and private game farm.   Opposition parties on the right and left have condemned Botha'sadministration for failing to prevent corruption at a time when manySouth Africans are hard hit by inflation and high taxes.   Even state radio has called for tougher anti-corruption measures.   ``The simultaneous emergence of irregular practices in differentareas has created a grossly distorted impression of rampantcorruption,'' the South African Broadcasting Corp. said in acommentary Wednesday. ``However, the underlying reality remains thattoo many serious shortcomings have been shown to exist.''   Zach de Beer, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive FederalParty, said the prevalence of corruption stems from the complexbureaucratic structures of apartheid and the white minoritygovernment's penchant for secrecy.   He said much of the corruption has been connected to the fournominally independent black homelands, where impoverished residentshave been governed by authoritarian, South African-backed leaders.   ``From the beginning, the non-viability of these areas had to bedealt with by the payment of large subsidies,'' said de Beer. ``But,because of their alleged independence, no proper control could beexercised over this handout of money.''   Another major factor behind the corruption, according togovernment critics, is the official encouragement of clandestinebusiness dealings as part of the nationwide effort to circumventeconomic sanctions imposed on South Africa.   Brian Pottinger, in a new book about Botha's first decade inpower (1978-88), writes that government officials have grownincreasingly accustomed to lavish fringe benefits. He says taxpayersin 1988 paid twice as much to finance perks for bureaucrats than thegovernment spent on education for the black majority.   The three parliament members who resigned during the last week inJanuary were:   _Manpower Minister Pietie du Plessis, who is being investigatedfor property transactions involving his department that may havebenefitted his son. Despite leaving under a cloud, he is due toreceive a one-time $100,000 payment and a $50,000 annual pension.   _Leon de Beer, who last week began a two-year prison term forengaging in electoral fraud in his 1987 campaign in Johannesburg'sHillbrow district.   _Peet de Pontes, a central figure in an investigation of fraud,corruption and perjury in connection with efforts to smuggle aconvicted Mafia drug financier from Italy into the black homeland ofCiskei.   In early February, a judicial commission recommended thatAmichand Rajbansi, a former Cabinet minister, never be appointed toany official post. The commission was investigating allegedirregularities in the Indian chamber of Parliament, which Rajbansiformerly led.   The scandals have extended into the private sector.   Sol Kerzner, a businessman who established a regional network ofgambling resorts, resigned Feb. 8 from all his executive positionsafter acknowledging that he paid a $1 million bribe to protect hiscompany's gambling rights in Transkei, another black homeland.   Business Day, the country's leading financial newspaper, said theenvironment for corruption was created 10 years ago when Bothahalted a major judicial inquiry into alleged misappropriation ofgovernment funds.   ``He tried to wrap South Africa in secrecy, and he has insteadwrapped it in shame,'' the newspaper said in an editorial thismonth. ``The way to repair the damage is to enforce the law. Agovernment which does not do that is plainly unfit to govern.''</TEXT></DOC>
