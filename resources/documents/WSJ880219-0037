The budget projects the payroll at 2,110,600 full-time equivalent employees in fiscal 1989, down from an estimated 2,123,482 in 1988.    About half those employees, 1,017,012, are civilians employed by the Pentagon. The other 1,093,648 work for all the other federal agencies. The tally excludes the Postal Service.    Mr. Reagan has cut the nondefense work force while increasing the size of the military staff about the same amount. In fiscal 1981, the nondefense payroll was 1,163,700 and the Pentagon's was 947,000. Total employment was 2,110,700 full-time equivalents.    In fiscal 1989, the payrolls for the departments of Justice, Labor, Transportation and Treasury would rise, as would payrolls of the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, according to the budget. Payrolls of several other departments, including Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services and Interior, would drop. </TEXT></DOC>
