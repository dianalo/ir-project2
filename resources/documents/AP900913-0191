The flavor industry replaces the savor we destroy, making a TVdinner taste less like cardboard.   ``In processing food to get it into the form people want or tomake it safe, flavor is processed out,'' said Bob Pellegrino,general manager at Cincinnati-based Fries andamp; Fries, one of thenation's largest flavor producers.   Grandma went to her garden or market for fresh produce hoursbefore preparing and serving it. But we've come to expect food towait months in warehouses and on store shelves, before it's poppedinto a microwave oven to be ready to eat in seconds _ and to stilltaste as good as grandma's.   To a surprising degree, it does, thanks to flavorists who havecreated an estimated $750 million-a-year industry that helps makethe food we eat palatable.   Flavorists usually are chemists who have spent several yearslearning to identify and duplicate natural flavors. Many say thencan discern thousands of flavors, nuances such as the differencebetween the part of an apple near the skin and the part near thecore.   The flavorist's challenge is to restore natural flavors, nomatter what modern processing, packaging, storage and cooking havedone to them.   America's changing lifestyle means that food processors have tocompensate for flavor that used to be provided by animal fats,cream and other high-cholesterol foods that don't fit into ourdiet-conscious lives.   ``There are a few words that are driving our industry _ light,or low-fat; natural; and convenient,'' Pellegrino said.   Flavoring agents are pervasive. Dairy products, bakery goods,desserts and beverages of all kinds are laced with flavorings. Justabout every package in your pantry lists flavoring as an ingredient.   Because ingredients are listed in descending order by weight,flavoring is last because it comprises less than one-half of 1percent of the weight of the product _ sometimes just a few partsper million.   ``That means 100 pounds of flavoring makes more than 20,000pounds of product,'' Pellegrino said. Liquid flavoring rolls out ofhis plant in 55-gallon drums and powders in 10,000-pound lots.   The flavor-making industry is secretive and clannish, Pellegrinosaid. A food company that markets its brand has a proprietaryinterest in the way its pot pie, pudding or potato chip tastes anddoesn't want anybody else to produce that flavor.   ``There's a high level of trust between the flavor company andthe food and beverage company,'' Pellegrino said. ``Service andconfidentiality are important. We'd be out of business prettyquickly if we said we were flavoring this or flavoring that.''   He refuses to identify any brand that uses his products. But hesays Fries andamp; Fries and a competitor, International Flavors andFragrances Inc., are among the nation's largest, each handlingabout 10 percent of the industry's business, or upward of $50million a year.   There are about 100 flavor companies in the United States, andabout 80 of them belong to the Washington, D.C.-based Flavor andExtract Manufacturers Association, said Earl Klinger, the group'sadministrator.   The association refuses to acknowledge any ranking among theindustry's companies or the volume of the business.   ``We really do not know for certain,'' Klinger said. ``It's notlegally possible to patent, copyright or otherwise protect aformula for a flavor, so the only way one company can maintain acompetitive advantage is to keep it a secret.   ``I've heard all sorts of figures, and we really have no way ofknowing.''   Flavorists like to say they can reproduce a flavor from tastethe way some musicians play songs by ear. In practice, they usuallystart by analyzing the chemical content of a food by using a gaschromatograph and listing the ingredients.   Then they recreate flavors in the laboratory, altering them anyway they choose by, for example, making a fruit drink taste riper,sweeter or more tart.   There might be 500 components in any flavor, and it is thedistinctive formulation of those components that makes one brand ofsoft drink taste different from another brand.   ``This is very much a self-policed industry, although we work inpartnership with the Food and Drug Administration,'' Pellegrinosaid.   Flavoring ingredients come from the FDA's ``Generally RecognizedAs Safe'' list, and many flavors are recreated from chemicals thatoccur naturally to produce the flavor being enhanced, he said.   Ruth Weisheit, supervisor of consumer affairs at the FDA'sCincinnati office, said flavorings are regulated as food additives.``Any new flavorings or new uses of a flavoring agent would requireFDA testing to make sure it is safe.''   Under the 1938 food labeling act, artificial flavorings can belisted as flavoring without identifying individual ingredients, Ms.Weisheit said.   ``One of the reasonings . . . is that a flavoring agent cancontain literally hundreds of ingredients, and it would be almostimpossible to have a label large enough to list all of them,'' shesaid.   Not all flavorings are used in food, Ms. Weisheit noted. Theyare in cough syrups, lipstick, mouthwash and drug products.   Flavorings are widely used throughout the beverage industry,from soft drinks and powdered mixes to liqueurs such as peachschnapps and apricot brandy.   A bigger challenge is making flavor additives that stand up toprocessing, especially microwave cooking, which tends to distorttraditional flavors, especially in meat and bakery products.   ``When you bake a cake, a lot of the flavor comes from thebaking process, and you just don't get that from a microwave,''Pellegrino said. There is no char-broiled flavor in a microwavedhamburger, without a flavor assist.   Sometimes, a laboratory-created flavor that's good for one itemis bad for another because of the way texture, aroma and flavor areaffected by cooking or the preservatives necessary to prolongshelf-life.   ``In beverages, you don't want the flavor to linger, but you dowant it in low-fat ice cream,'' Pellegrino said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, Sept. 17</NOTE></DOC>
