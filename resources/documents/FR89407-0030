The assessment provides a basis forthe conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineered tobaccoplants will not present a risk of introduction or dissemination of a plantpest and will not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Dr. Michael Schechtman, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 845, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-8761.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Rohm and Haas Company of Des Plaines, Illinois, has submitted an applicationfor a permit for release into the environment, to field test geneticallyengineered insect resistant tobacco plants modified to express the delta-endotoxingene.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tobacco plant under the conditionsdescribed in the Rohm and Haas Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by the Rohm and Haas Company, as well as areview of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene for insect resistance has been inserted into the tobacco chromosome.In nature, chromosomal genetic material from plants can only be transferredto other sexually compatible plants by cross-pollination. In this fieldtest trial, the introduced gene cannot spread to other plants by cross-pollinationbecause the field test plot is located at a sufficient distance from anysexually compatible plants with which the experimental tobacco plants couldcross-pollinate.2. Neither the delta-endotoxin gene itself, nor its gene product, conferson tobacco any plant pest characteristics.3. The microorganism from which the delta-endotoxin gene was isolated isnot a plant pest and is widely distributed in the environment as a soilinhabitant.4. The vector used to transfer the delta-endotoxin gene to tobacco plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for producing plant disease have beenremoved from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown not to bepathogenic to any susceptible plants. 5. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vectorDNA and the delta-endotoxin gene into the plant cells, has been shown tobe eliminated and no longer associated with the transformed tobacco plants.6. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering and inserting the gene into the tobacco genome (i.e.,chromosomal DNA). The vector does not survive in the transformed plants.No horizontal movement mechanism that can transfer an inserted gene froma chromosome of a transformed plant to a chromosome of another organismhas been shown to exist in nature. 7. The toxic polypeptide produced by the insect resistance gene is calleddelta-endotoxin. Upon ingestion, the toxin kills lepidopteran insects.Delta-endotoxin is not toxic to most other insects, or to birds, fish,or mammals. Because of its safety, its topical application on vegetablecrops is permitted up to date of harvest. 8. There will be two small field test sites. At the first site, less than1.2 acres will be utilized in these field trials, no other tobacco willbe planted on this farm, and the test will be situated approximately onehalf mile from the nearest property line. At the second, a half-acre site,the test tobacco plants will not be allowed to flower. 9. Both sites have good security. Incursions by large animals and humansat the first site will be deterred by the presence of surrounding cultivatedfields. At the second site, a barbed wire fence isolates the farm fromthe surrounding rural land. Both sites have been previously employed assites for release of genetically engineered plants under USDA permit. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384 and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 3rd day of April 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
