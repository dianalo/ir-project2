But the computers at Washington Econometrics Forecasting Services see it differently.    The consulting firm plugged the policy proposals of Rep. Kemp (R., N.Y.) and the other presidential candidates into its 100-equation computer model of the economy to see how they would shape the future. The results of a Kemp presidency: five years of depression.    The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, both Democrats, do better, but not by much. Their policies produce an economy growing a slim 1% or less in 1993. The real growth candidate, according to the study, is Pat Robertson, a Republican, who would have the economy expanding at a 3.4% clip by 1993.    Such crystal-ball gazing, of course, must be tempered with some big caveats. There is, for instance, the small problem that economic forecasts are often wrong. And then there's the political reality: presidents rarely do exactly what they promise to do.    &quot;They've never been in touch with our office, so we have to assume they haven't the slightest idea what policies Kemp would put into effect,&quot; scoffs John Buckley, spokesman for the Kemp campaign.    Adds Stephen McNees, an economist at the Boston Federal Reserve Bank who monitors econometric forecasts: &quot;It sounds good in theory, but in practice, it's problematic. Even the candidates who have been most specific still speak in a level of generality far higher than you would need to plug numbers into a model.&quot;    But James O'Connor, president of Washington Econometrics is undaunted. &quot;This is a serious exercise,&quot; he says.    The Kemp depression, he says, is caused by the candidate's proposal to return to a gold standard; the Robertson boom is based largely on the candidate's proposal to phase out all farm subsidies.    The computer model did have a piece of good news for the Kemp campaign. His proposals, it shows, would eliminate inflation. Unfortunately, they would replace that with deflation. &quot;A gold standard would have a very deflationary effect,&quot; says Mr. O'Connor.    Mr. O'Connor says that his firm, which is only a little more than a year old, has established a reputation for &quot;going out on a limb.&quot; In its latest mailing, for instance, the company gives its own forecast: The nation will enter a period of hyperinflation that will boost the price of an average men's suit to $9,549 by the year 2000 and a cup of coffee to $19.10. </TEXT></DOC>
