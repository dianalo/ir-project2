Mr. Tubbs said several bankerscomplained that zealous bank examiners were inhibiting creditextension, but others at the meeting called the examinersfirm but fair.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Tubbs said the president spent most the 90-minutesession listening to the bankers discuss credit conditions.In addition, the bankers:   -- Praised the recent package of regulatory adjustments toaddress the credit crunch.   -- Supported comprehensive banking legislation but urgedthe president to veto any bill that restricts, rather thanexpands, bank powers to compete with securities and insurancecompanies.   -- Opposed a further increase in the premiums banks pay tofinance federal deposit insurance.   Political pressure is building for a premium increase inthe face of concerns that bank failures are depleting thedeposit insurance fund more rapidly than expected.
