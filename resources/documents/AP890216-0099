Construction of new homes and apartments was up 8 percent inJanuary to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.69 million unitsafter inching up just 0.1 percent during December, the CommerceDepartment reported.   It was the biggest monthly increase since an 8.6 percent rise inFebruary 1988 and placed housing activity at its highest level sincethe March 1987 annual rate of 1.72 million units.   At the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwatercalled the figures ``good news for the housing industry and a goodsign that people are confident in the economy.''   Analysts said the increase was mainly the result of unseasonablywarm, dry weather throughout much of the country, which allowed morehousing starts than in a typical January. Small increases can beamplified as the figures are annualized and seasonally adjusted.   ``We don't believe this is representative of the underlying trendin the market,'' David Seiders, chief economist for the NationalAssociation of Home Builders, said of January's surge. ``We don'texpect it to hold this way. We're betting on a slowdown as we gothrough the year.''   Housing construction dropped 8.2 percent in 1988 to its lowestlevel in six years, and is expected to decline again this year asmortgage rates continue to rise and the general economic expansionslows.   Nevertheless, analysts say the housing market still is relativelyhealthy and that January's numbers may suggest some new strength.   ``It's really pretty surprising to see this much strength in thehousing market when interest rates have been rising and when theaffordability of housing is getting harder for people to meet,''said economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions.   ``Underneath it all, we're seeing a surprisingly strong housingmarket given the financial conditions,'' he said.   Single-family homes were built in January at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 1.2 million units, the highest sinceSeptember 1987, when the rate was 1.23 million. January's figure wasup 7.1 percent from December.   Seiders said part of the strength in the single-family market wasdue to the use of adjustable-rate mortgages that allow families tostart out making lower monthly payments than otherwise possible.   Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.56 percentlast week, up from 9.84 percent a year earlier, according to asurvey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. On one-yearadjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initialrate of 8.61 percent, up from 7.61 percent a year earlier.   Apartment construction, a volatile category, was up 10.1 percentlast month to 490,000 units, after a 3.7 percent gain in December.   The apartment sector has been weakened by high vacancy rates andchanges under the 1986 tax law that reduced incentives for investingin rental projects.   Overall, January's gains in new construction were concentrated inthe Northeast, where housing starts shot up 51.8 percent to anannual rate of 296,000 units.   Analysts again said mild weather was behind the upturn in aregion where the housing market has been weak in recent months afteran earlier boom during which prices soared.   ``The Northeast overall is still a market that is not as strongas it was a couple years ago,'' Regalia said. ``It's going through anormal cycle and it's going to be ebbing somewhat in the comingmonths, but I don't see that as crashing.''   Construction rose 4.4 percent in the West in January, to a rateof 449,000 units, and 3 percent in the South to 616,000 units.Housing starts were down 3.8 percent in the Midwest, to a rate of332,000 units.   Housing permits, a good barometer of future housing activity,were down 2.7 percent last month to a rate of 1.52 million unitsafter rising 3.3 percent in December.   Housing construction reached its post-recession peak in 1986,when 1.81 million units were built, then began sliding. Last year,the level was 1.49 million units.</TEXT></DOC>
