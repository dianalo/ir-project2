In nearby Compton, the city council voted to ban the powerfulsemiautomatic weapons outright.   ``We're happy to have them off the streets,'' said Sgt. MikeMiskowiec, at the Los Angeles Police Department's southwestdivision, where a man and woman brought in 13 AK-47 assault riflesThursday evening.   ``They went out and purchased 13 of these guns and brought themdown to us,'' he said.   Los Angeles Councilman Nate Holden, who is running for mayor,announced Tuesday that he would buy semiautomatic assault rifles forup to $300, using $50,000 from a political action committee fund.Counting the 13 brought in by the unidentified couple, and sevenmore bought and brought in by a real estate agency, the number ofweapons turned in stood at 36 Thursday.   The Compton vote and Holden's offer in Los Angeles came in thewake of the Jan. 17 massacre at a Stockton schoolyard in whichdrifter Patrick Edward Purdy opened fire on students with an AK-47.He killed five children and wounded 29 others and one teacher beforetaking his own life.   In Compton, the ban on the sale or possession of AK-47s and othersemiautomatic weapons was passed by the City Council on Tuesday. Itis scheduled to take effect Feb. 19.   ``It was time for somebody to take the first step,'' saidCouncilman Maxcy Filer, who wrote the ordinance. ``What we're tryingto do is get guns off the streets and out of the hands ofcriminals.''   Some Compton officials have expressed concern the ordinance won'tsurvive a constitutional challenge, however, and the National RifleAssociation's office in Washington, D.C., has vowed to fight it.   Compton, a city of 96,000 located 12 miles south of downtown LosAngeles, has one of the highest murder rates in the area. Itrecorded 80 killings in 1987, one for every 1,200 residents,according to FBI statistics.   Holden rejected criticism that his effort is a publicity stuntfor his campaign to unseat four-term Mayor Tom Bradley in the Aprilelection.   Miskowiec refused to name the couple who brought in the 13 gunsand said he didn't know why they made the purchase. New AK-47sgenerally range in price from about $300 to $1,500 for a customizedversion, according to gun dealers.   Among the AK-47s turned in Thursday were seven bought by a SanFernando Valley real estate office for more than $2,500.   ``We just decided to go ahead and get these things off thestreet,'' said Jeffrey Fox, an office employee. He called it asymbolic action.   One woman had an AK-47 stolen out of her car Thursday when shestopped at a gas station on the way to turn it in, Miskowiec said.</TEXT></DOC>
