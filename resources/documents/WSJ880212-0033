Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> FRX MON PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The Bank of Canada intervened in foreign exchange trading yesterday to slow the steady rise of its currency against the U.S. dollar.    The action by the Canadian central bank nonetheless failed to stop the Canadian dollar from climbing to a four-year high against the dollar yesterday. In trading, the U.S. dollar was narrowly mixed.    Demand for Canadian dollars from foreign investors and speculators has increased sharply since U.S. interest rates began declining this fall. This has widened yield spreads that already favored Canadian investments, as Canadian rates remained steady. Also intensifying demand for Canada's currency are projections for lower inflation in the nation, while Canada's economic growth outpaces the U.S. economy.    &quot;It's interest-rate driven,&quot; William G. Orsini, a currency risk manager at Bank of Montreal, New York, said of the Canadian dollar. &quot;There's still a lot of interest to buy it,&quot; he added.    The Canadian dollar was quoted at 79.17 U.S. cents in late New York trading. That was up 0.4% from 78.85 U.S. cents Wednesday and up 2.9% so far this year.    The Bank of Canada's intervention seemed more like a warning to the market rather than an attempt to halt the trend in exchange rates. Traders said the central bank sold a relatively small amount of its currency to Canadian commercial bank participants in the foreign exchange market. &quot;They're just letting the market know that they're there,&quot; said a trader at a bank that dealt with the Bank of Canada yesterday.    Since the Canadian dollar began climbing late last year traders and economists have speculated that at some point the Bank of Canada might act to stem its rise. A stronger currency could hurt Canadian exports to the U.S. by making Canadian goods more expensive for Americans to buy.    Demand for Canadian dollars increased yesterday following Wednesday evening's budget report by Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson. Mr. Wilson called the economy &quot;fundamentally sound&quot; and projected a 1.4% reduction in Canada's budget deficit for fiscal 1989.    Traders keyed off Mr. Wilson's report, beginning in Asian markets overnight, and on their own views that Canadian interest rates won't follow U.S. rates lower. &quot;Michael Wilson gave no hint at all that the Bank of Canada will let interest rates come down. So you have two very closely related countries taking opposite monetary views,&quot; said a trader at a Canadian bank. &quot;You have people in the states worrying about recession and people in Canada worried about inflation,&quot; he said.    &quot;I'm still bullish on the Canadian dollar. You have to assume the Japanese are going to continue to buy Canadian dollars at these levels,&quot; he added.    The spread between U.S. and Canadian three-month Treasury bills yesterday was 265 basis points, with Canada's instrument yielding 8.25%, in contrast to 5.6% yield on the American security.    In other trading, the dollar eased to 1.6915 West German marks, from 1.6930, and firmed to 129.35 yen, from 129.08. The British pound inched higher to $1.7585, from $1.7580.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at 129.50 yen.    Outside of the Canadian dollar, trading Thursday was very light as dealers sat on the sidelines awaiting today's report on U.S. December merchandise trade from the Commerce Department.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 60 cents an ounce to $440 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $441.45 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Thursday, Feb. 11, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
