Separately, Sweden's Bank Inspection Board launched an insider-trading investigation to determine whether members of Fermenta's board sold shares in the company using privileged information.    Mr. el-Sayed's forfeiture will make AB Industrivaerden, a holding company that had been owed the equivalent of $78.9 million by Mr. el-Sayed, Fermenta's biggest shareholder. Industrivaerden said it will keep shares amounting to a 43% stake in Fermenta held as security for Mr. el-Sayed's debt, which came due yesterday.    The planned sale of a different large block of Fermenta stock to Industrivaerden and another Swedish holding company, Investment AB Beijer, is likely to be rescinded before year's end. The companies threatened to call off the sale after state-controlled Procordia AB withdrew from proposed transactions with Mr. el-Sayed that would have given it near-majority control of Fermenta.    Industrivaerden said the average price of the four million Fermenta Class A shares that Mr. el-Sayed will forfeit was $12.90 each, while the 2,980,000 Class B shares Industrivaerden will receive were valued at $10.04 each.    Kjell Braendstroem, Industrivaerden's managing director, said his chief aim is to create an atmosphere of stability at Fermenta. &quot;It's our decisive intention to create the stability and working quiet that Fermenta so badly needs,&quot; he said. &quot;We must regain the confidence of customers, suppliers and financiers.&quot;    A year of mounting controversy and confusion over Fermenta came to a head last weekend when the company's board said it will offer to resign at a special shareholders meeting Dec. 30 because of auditors' questions about the company's financial reports. Fermenta announced Saturday that the auditors had serious questions about its books. As a result, Fermenta said pre-tax profit wouldn't reach the previously projected $100.4 million this year. It also said the $50.63 million in pretax profit it reported for the first eight months of 1986 could be wiped out.    Mr. Braendstroem said a new Fermenta board will be elected at the special shareholders meeting. He added that Mr. el-Sayed will leave his post as Fermenta's president and his seat on the board.    Mr. Braendstroem has said he hopes to sell Industrivaerden's Fermenta shares to an appropriate buyer and split with Mr. el-Sayed any profit made on the shares exceeding the $78.9 million debt.    The forfeiture leaves Egyptian-born Mr. el-Sayed with a 33% stake in Fermenta, according to Torvald Ranta, Mr. el-Sayed's financial consultant. He said most of this stock, however, is being held as collateral for other debts of Mr. el-Sayed, although he retains the voting rights.    These debts, which come due next summer, include $76.7 million to Goetabanken, $28.7 million to Nordanken and $16.3 million to AB Electrolux.    The debts, like the one owed to Industrivaerden, stem from the collapse of Mr. el-Sayed's agreement with AB Volvo to restructure Sweden's pharmaceutical businesses, following news that he had lied about possessing certain academic credentials.    The collapse of that agreement was followed by an offer to acquire Fermenta by Montedison S.p.A. But the negotiations failed, and the Italian chemical concern withdrew its bid for Fermenta because it said Mr. el-Sayed had sold key company assets and shareholdings that were to go to the Italian group under a preliminary accord. The talks also were hampered by opposition to the sale by Fermenta's unions.    Meanwhile, Goeran Svensson, the Bank Inspection Board's director, said the governmental body is investigating whether Fermenta directors sold shares in the company knowing that auditors had raised questions about the company's books.    Mr. Svensson said he couldn't provide details about which board members were being investigated in the insider-trading inquiry. He said the penalty for insider trading carries a fine that depends on personal income, or a maximum two-year jail term.    The Stockholm Stock Exchange halted trading in Fermenta after the weekend disclosures, and said it will launch an investigation into its finances. Meanwhile, Fermenta shares plunged in London, where they continued to trade, to $7.17 at one point yesterday from their Friday close in Stockholm of $15.06.    Bengt Ryden, the Stockholm exchange's chairman, said trading in Fermenta will remain halted &quot;until further notice.&quot; He said the company's &quot;economic position&quot; will be discussed at a meeting of the exchange's board, to be convened as soon as possible.    The meeting will be the third time this year the exchange board has considered Fermenta's conduct. Many observers said the company's weekend disclosures could result in its expulsion from the Stockholm exchange. Twice in the past seven months the company has been fined by the board and barely escaped expulsion for issuing inadequate information to the stock market. </TEXT></DOC>
