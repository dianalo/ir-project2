Keating Jr. openstomorrow in a courtroom crowded with angry bondholders.   But what about law?</LP><TEXT>   The case will probably turn on whether the Los AngelesCounty district attorney's office can link the onetimechairman of American Continental Corp. -- to many the symbolof the 1980s thrift-industry debacle -- with alleged criminalconduct by his employees. To support their case, prosecutorswill attempt to use a legal theory that is all but untestedin the area of securities law: that the head of a companymust be held accountable for the wrongful acts ofsubordinates, even if the executive didn't know that thespecific acts had occurred.   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito is likely to decide duringthe first day of trial whether prosecutors can deliver thatargument to the jury. If he agrees, then the people ofCalifornia could make things bad not only for Mr. Keating butfor many other top executives across the country. Even thoughrulings by trial judges aren't binding elsewhere, in widelypublicized trials they are closely watched.   &quot;It's an attempt to change American law by creating newfelony criminal liability for officers and directors arisingsolely from their titles of president or chairman,&quot; says AbbeLowell, the attorney for former American Continentalpresident Judy Wischer, who is scheduled to be triedseparately in the case.   John Cotton, a Los Angeles lawyer who formerly prosecutedcases for the Securities and Exchange Commission, adds: &quot;Acorporate officer who sits at the top {and} whosesubordinates commit a crime isn't liable simply because hewas in charge. He has to do more. Wearing a white collarisn't a crime. Getting it dirty is.&quot;   Both Mr. Keating and Ms. Wischer are said to be among thetargets of a separate two-year federal investigation intoAmerican Continental and the Phoenix, Ariz., company's formerLincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association unit in California, thoughcharges haven't been filed against them. That case isexpected to involve much broader allegations of bank fraud inconnection with the failure of the thrift -- which was seizedby federal regulators in April 1989, a day after AmericanContinental filed for bankruptcy-law protection.   The theory advocated by Mr. Keating's prosecutors in thestate trial here has been approved by various courts.However, it has usually been used in cases that stem fromaccusations that an executive has violated health and safetyregulations, often those affecting food, drugs or theenvironment.   &quot;A responsible corporate officer can be liable withoutconsciousness of wrongdoing,&quot; the Supreme Court declared 16years ago, in a case about rats in a restaurant warehouse,because public policy demands it. In that instance, a companypresident was convicted because he had the power to correctviolations and didn't do so.   The theory is a hybrid, say prosecutors. It combines legalexceptions to two common notions -- that guilt requiresintent to commit a crime and that people are responsible onlyfor their own acts. One exception comes from the securitiesstatute, which prosecutors interpret as outlawingmisstatements regardless of the intent with which they weremade. The other exception derives from the body of civil lawthat makes business owners liable for on-the-job misdeeds ofworkers.   In the Keating case, prosecutors have received supportfrom the North American Securities Administrators Associationand some lawyers. &quot;The lesson and the real public policyissue here is: Are we serious about preventing securitiesfraud? If we are, then this kind of a theory ought to beimposed,&quot; says Joseph C. Long, special counsel to theassociation, which is an organization of securitiesregulators that wrote a friend-of-the-court brief in thecase.   Stephen C. Neal, Mr. Keating's lawyer, says prosecutorsare improperly trying to stretch civil-law concepts over acriminal case. &quot;If the state's theory of the law is right,then in any case where you could prove civil liabilityagainst a company under the federal securities law, you couldindict the senior officers in the state of California on afelony charge,&quot; he says.   Mr. Long maintains that the theory wouldn't createautomatic criminal liability in the executive suite everytime something bad happens in a branch office. Under therule, he says, officers can defend themselves by arguing thatthey weren't in charge of the program being challenged.   The importance of the theory is highlighted, someobservers say, because the theory is crucial to the state'scase. Prosecutors aren't exactly throwing the book at Mr.Keating. It's more like a few pages from the CaliforniaCorporations Code, which outlaws the &quot;sale of securities bymeans of false statements or omissions.&quot;   There is little doubt that is what happened at LincolnSavings branches. Grand-jury witnesses told of retirees drawnaway from deposit windows to bond desks by smooth-talkingsalespeople who suggested that American Continental debt wassafe. But it's also obvious that Mr. Keating &quot;didn't sit atthe bond desk,&quot; in the words of one prosecutor. Mr. Keatingsays that he wasn't told how the subordinated debentures werepitched and that prospectuses supplied by AmericanContinental were accurate.   In pretrial hearings, Judge Ito questioned theprosecution's theory but deferred a final ruling. If herejects the government's view, prosecutors will probably berequired to argue that Mr. Keating knew about the misleadingsales techniques and either encouraged them in some way ordidn't stop them. That's not an easy case to prove, lawyerssay.   &quot;Unless they've got people who say, `Charlie told us tosell them this way,' or `We told Charlie we were selling themthis way,' then they've got problems,&quot; says Steven Gourley, aformer California Corporations Commission lawyer now inprivate practice in Los Angeles.   Former federal prosecutor John Bartko says that if no suchevidence exists, Mr. Keating could argue that as head of sucha large and complex company he was entitled to rely on advicefrom accountants, lawyers and others. Says Mr. Bartko, a SanFrancisco attorney: &quot;It's going to boil down to the same oldquestion: What did he know, and when did he know it?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
