Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JEFGEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jefferies Group Inc. reported a 36% decline in third-quarter net income, blaming a $1.5 million loss related to a single trading position that the company declined to discuss.    The holding company for Jefferies andamp; Co., a brokerage firm that specializes in third-market stock trades, said it earned $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share, in the latest quarter, compared with $2.8 million, or 35 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 16% to $32.3 million from $38.4 million.    Frank E. Baxter, Jefferies Group president, said the trading position that resulted in the loss had been liquidated since the loss was taken. He wouldn't discuss it further because, he said, the company doesn't talk about specific trades. The loss, $3 million on a pretax basis, was disclosed because &quot;it is unique for us to take a loss like that in one position,&quot; Mr. Baxter said.    A brokerage concern might experience a loss if it purchased shares for a customer who refused to pay for the stock, although Mr. Baxter wouldn't say what circumstances surrounded the loss.    Earlier this year, Jefferies Group reported that it had taken a 1986 loss of $1.2 million as its part of a total $5 million loss on a transaction. Its former chairman, Boyd L. Jefferies, personally paid the remaining $3.8 million of the loss, Jefferies Group said at the time. Mr. Baxter also declined then to discuss the specifics of that transaction. The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned the accounting that allowed Jefferies Group to reflect only $1.2 million of the total loss on the transaction, although the SEC staff later accepted the company's accounting.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Jefferies Group closed at $13 a share, up 25 cents.    Mr. Baxter said Jefferies Group's commission revenues for the year are 3% below the levels of 1986, with revenues from principal transactions up 5%.    In the latest nine months, Jefferies Group net fell 26% to $7 million, or 89 cents a share, from $9.4 million, or $1.16 a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 6.7% to $108.3 million from $116 million. </TEXT></DOC>
