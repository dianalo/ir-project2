Four years ago, the two clashed in a bitter race for the prime ministership only to have voters deny a majority to either, forcing them to form a national-unity government that has been anything but unified. As they go at it again, both men seem less and less relevant to Israeli voters, who are increasingly polarized over the central issue facing Israel: the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs living in the West Bank and Gaza. Months of rioting by Palestinians who insist that Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat is their legitimate leader gives the issue new urgency.    &quot;In polls you have 50% (of Israelis) saying expell all the Arabs and you have 50% saying negotiate with the PLO,&quot; says Yitzhak Galnoor, a professor of politics at Hebrew University. &quot;What that means is you have 100% in favor of some solution, but the major parties aren't providing one.&quot; Indeed, disillusionment with both candidates is so great that when Ha'aretz, a leading newspaper, conducted a survey for Israel's Man of the Year, 60% of respondents couldn't name anyone worthy of the honor. Mr. Peres won the title with a mere 8% of the vote, beating out Mr. Shamir with a meager 6%.    With election day only a week from today and neither man looking like a clear winner, Israel's Arab neighbors have launched their own campaign to break the deadlock. In a bizarre development, Arab leaders such as Jordan's King Hussein and senior officials of both Egypt and the PLO have blitzed the international media in recent days with the message that Mr. Peres is more likely to advance the cause of peace than Mr. Shamir. (Officially, however, the PLO is being its usual inconsistent self. A spokesman in Tunis yesterday denied the PLO favored the Labor Party and said it only wanted Israelis to vote for &quot;peace&quot; rather than &quot;war.&quot;)    The U.S. also has tried to help Mr. Peres, though more subtly, through gestures such as inviting him to meet with President Reagan just as the Israeli campaign was getting under way.    Another deadlocked Israeli government will create a headache for the next U.S. administration. Palestinians, frustrated by such an outcome, could abandon rocks for guns and grenades, prompting Israel into even harsher reprisals -- raising tensions not only between Israel and a human-rights-sensitive America but also between the U.S. and the Arabs.    Unlike four years ago when Israel's economic woes dominated the election, the only real issue this year is the Palestinian problem. Mr. Peres favors giving back some of the occupied territories through Arab-Israel negotiations at an international peace conference. Mr. Shamir says he will never yield land and wants no international interference. Neither position has galvanized the public.    &quot;It's hard to tell there is a campaign going on,&quot; says Mr. Galnoor. Election law forbids appearances by the candidates on prime-time news, so Israeli elections traditionally are built around mass rallies and corridor debates. But this year there is little of that.    &quot;We've printed thousands of bumper stickers,&quot; says former Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, &quot;but I haven't seen a one.&quot;    Old faces and old ideas may be part of the explanation. Mr. Peres, 65 years old, has been a Labor Party stalwart since Israel's creation 40 years ago. Mr. Shamir, 73, has been around almost as long, entering politics in 1970 and heading the Likud bloc since Menahem Begin's resignation in 1983. For either man, a loss at the polls will probably mean the end of his political career. Sensing the public's desire for new faces and new ideas, both parties have stacked their candidate list with younger, fresh faces.    Another explanation may be Mr. Shamir's icy campaign style. The former Israeli secret service agent seems unable to shake his spy's aversion to bright lights, cameras and public attention. Working a crowd, he often wears the expression of someone being forced to chew ground glass. &quot;The man is all ideology,&quot; says a Likud campaign official. &quot;The handshaking part of politics means nothing to him.&quot;    Foreign Minister Peres is a more relaxed campaigner, quick with a joke or riposte to a heckler. Lately, though, the silver-haired Labor leader seems weary on the stump, his oratorical skills barely concealing rote and repetition.    But the major reason for the lackluster campaign seems to be public distaste for what most Israelis see as the same old non-solutions. Standing on a rocky hillside in Ariel, a large Jewish settlement on the occupied West Bank, Prime Minister Shamir recently thundered through his standard election speech as army searchlights scanned surrounding olive groves for Palestinian stone-throwers.    Michele Opatowski, who traveled to Ariel from Tel Aviv to hear the prime minister, shakes his head dejectedly as he listens. &quot;This may be an important election,&quot; he says, &quot;but I won't be voting. Neither side is prepared to break the deadlock and say something new.&quot;    So disillusioned are voters that, ironically, this election being fought over the issue of what to do with the Arab population could be decided by Arabs. When Israeli voters go to the polls, at least one in 10 will be an Arab. Unlike their relatives on the West Bank and Gaza, these Arabs stayed in Israel when the state was created in 1948 and thus, as citizens, have the right to vote. Because the Israeli Arab birthrate outstrips that of Israeli Jews, Arabs have gained electoral significance over the years.    &quot;This is the first time in the history of the state that the Arab vote will decide the government of Israel,&quot; says Mr. Weizman, the Labor campaign chairman. Arabs vote overwhelmingly for the left; only 4% of the Arab vote went to the more conservative Likud bloc in the last election. In that election, 72% of Arabs voted and a similar turnout this time could account for 12 or 13 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.    Those seats could be vital in forming a new government. Labor worries that Arabs, dismayed by the bullets and beatings ordered against their Palestinian kin by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a former Labor prime minister, could encourage Arabs to stay away from the polls.    That worry may be justified. &quot;To me, the choice between Labor and Likud is like the choice between hanging and the electric chair,&quot; says Hakim, a young Israeli Arab.    &quot;These are very tough times,&quot; says Nawaf Massalha, one of three Arab-Israelis standing as a labor candidate. Bumping along in his car over an unpaved road toward an Arab village, he says, &quot;I can campaign out here all day, but at night on the news people hear of a few more Arabs killed and they aren't so sure why they want to vote Labor.&quot;    Mr. Massalha, who answers a knock on his door with a Hebrew &quot; boker tov&quot; (good morning) followed by an Arabic &quot;etfaddal&quot; (come in) is criticized by fellow Arabs for being too close to the Jews. As a member of the executive of the powerful Histadrut labor federation, he occupies an influential place in Israeli society. Yet he is often stopped, harassed and humiliated by Israelis for being an Arab. Returning from an official visit to Canada in March, he was interrogated for an hour and a half by airport security.    Both parties are courting Arab voters. Political figures appear almost as often sipping coffee in Arab villages as visiting synagogues and shopping malls in Jewish towns. Even hard-line Likud leaders acknowledge the Arab vote could be decisive.    &quot;It's a fact of life,&quot; says Moshe Arens, Likud's minister for Arab affairs, who has set up a committee to wrest some Arab votes from Labor. &quot;It's to Israel's credit, and a source of pride, that the Arab population comes to the polls with full equality with Jewish citizens. Israel's Arab population probably are the only Arabs in the Middle East who participate in the democratic process.&quot;    Asked for a prediction of the election outcome, Labor's Mr. Weizman resorts to the ubiquitous Arabic expression of caution about future events: &quot;Insha'allah&quot; -- God willing -- &quot;We'll win.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
