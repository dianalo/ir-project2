Although hopes dimmed for a new arms treaty under PresidentReagan, the news was not all bad.   Both sides are still talking, rather than shouting as they didearly in the Reagan administration, and they are discussing moreissues more seriously than ever before.   Perhaps the most important development that the summit showed,and the one that is hardest to measure, is the growing role thatdomestic political developments in the Soviet Union are playing insuperpower relations.   Reagan, who built his political career as a Communist basher, wasimpressed by the changes in Soviet policy under Mikhail S.Gorbachev, whom he called ``a serious man seeking serious reform.''   `Quite possibly, we are beginning to take down the barriers ofthe postwar era, quite possibly we are entering a new era inhistory, a time of lasting change in the Soviet Union,'' saidReagan, who early in his term branded the Soviet Union, an ``evilempire.''   Within hours after Reagan left Moscow on Friday, Gorbachevexhibited the harmonious summit in a political battle againstdomestic opponents of his campaign of ``perestroika'' to reform theSoviet economy.   The Kremlin leader fought off a conservative attempt at a MoscowCommunist Party executive committee meeting to block prominentreformers from attending an important national party conferencestarting June 28.   As Gorbachev looked on, one of his allies, Moscow party chief LevZaikov, told opponents of reform that the summit marked ``a concreteresult of perestroika in foreign policy.''   The change in Soviet political debate, while nowhere near as openas the battles in the West, has been accompanied by a shift in thenature of arms control negotiations. The superpowers are nowdiscussing deep cuts in new systems, unlike agreements of the 1960sand 1970s, which limited rather than reduced arsenals.   And the Soviets, for the first time, are willing to allowAmericans to make on-site inspections to monitor compliance with theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) pact signed last Decemberand ratified by the U.S. Senate last month.   Reagan and Gorbachev shook hands over the INF pact at the summit,and ended five days of intensive talks by declaring some progress ontwo of five major obstacles to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty(START) to slash nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.   But they did not clear the major hurdle to START: Reagan'sStrategic Defense Initiative plan for space-based defenses. And theyreported no progress on Soviet demands to limit the number ofsea-launched cruise missiles or U.S. demands that the Soviets phaseout their heavy SS-18 missiles.   On conventional arms, there was a subtle hint of motion.   A few hours after Reagan arrived in Moscow last Sunday, Gorbachevproposed they exchange data on conventional forces to try toeliminate ``asymmetries'' in the opposing forces. The Warsaw Pacthas more forces and NATO has more anti-tank guns.   A senior U.S. official called Gorbachev's presentation ``arestatement of past Soviet ideas rather than a proposal.''   ``He just sort of moved some commas around'' on a 1986 proposalfor a 500,000-troop reduction in Warsaw Pact and NATO forces inEurope, said the official, speaking on condition that he not beidentified.   U.S. analysts said before the summit they anticipated Gorbachevmight announce unilateral cuts of 50,000 to 100,000 troops.   But one Soviet spokesman rejected that.   ``I would not be in favor of the idea of a unilateral cut,'' saidSergei Plekhanov, deputy director of the Institute for theUSA-Canada. ``We have been making a lot of concessions.''   Western politicians would like to see cuts in Warsaw Pact forces,which they claim have an edge of 2-to-1 in tanks.   The Soviet Union has, for the first time, accepted the NATOargument that the Warsaw Pact has more tanks, but they argue thatthe West has more attack aircraft and other forces.   Gorbachev has been proposing that the two sides exchangeinformation about European forces. But the Americans insist thatconventional force negotiations can only take place in a foruminvolving all the nations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.   Thus the talks will be part of the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe, the successor to the Helsinki negotiationsthat led the Soviet Union, in 1975, to promise to observe humanrights.   Before his trip to Moscow, Reagan had accused the Kremlin of widehuman rights abuses _ blocking progress on conventional arms. Butnow that Reagan has declared Gorbachev sincere in his reforms, theAmericans might be more inclined to enter into hard bargaining forconventional forces reductions.   Toning down U.S. criticism of human rights policy, said a seniorU.S. official, ``makes it a lot easier for Gorbachev to change hispolicies.''   And the West would like nothing better to see smallerconventional armies in Europe and a better Soviet record on humanrights.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Bryan Brumley, a national security writer basedin Washington, has covered the summits in Reykjavik, Washington andMoscow, and was an Associated Press correspondent in Moscow in1981-82.</TEXT></DOC>
