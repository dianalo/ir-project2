Paul, whose lavish ways propelled him into the public eye, hasbeen a target of regulators since they took over Florida's one-timelargest thrift in February at an estimated loss of $1.8 billion.   The Office of Thrift Supervision, which charged that Paulsurrounded himself with luxury ``to satisfy his insatiable greedand vanity,'' sought the huge bond to prevent him from squanderingmoney from the failed CenTrust.   The government initially set a Nov. 1 deadline for payment ofthe bond, but Paul won some time by challenging the administrativeorder in U.S. District Court. His arguments were rejected Tuesday,and OTS set a new deadline of noon Thursday.   But Steve Davis, a Paul attorney, said Wednesday that an appealwas being prepared for the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals inAtlanta.   Paul's attorneys charged the government was forcing him to payrestitution without a way to defend himself against claims he usedbank funds for his personal use, but U.S. District Judge EdwardDavis rejected those arguments.   The judge upheld the application of the 1989 Sandamp;L bailout lawagainst Paul, rejected arguments that OTS was improperly pursuingenforcement actions without benefit of due process or trial, andcited an ``important governmental interest'' in protectingdepositors' interests.   ``The ruling is clear. The constitutional arguments werecompletely without merit,'' OTS attorney Faith Hochberg said in atelephone interview from Jersey City, N.J. ``We believe it was aproper order from the beginning and have followed proper judicialproceedings throughout.''   OTS wants Paul to post the $30.8 million bond, file anaccounting of his assets and seek OTS approval of any change ofpersonal assets involving $5,000 or more.   Among questionable CenTrust spending cited by OTS are a $15million legal defense fund for thrift officers and directors,CenTrust's sumptuously appointed 47-story office tower in downtownMiami, Old Masters paintings and a private dinner cooked byEuropean chefs flown in for the occasion.</TEXT></DOC>
