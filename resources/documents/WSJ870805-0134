But the Fairness Doctrine isn't dead yet -- its supporters in Congress will try to drag it out of its coffin this fall by attaching it to a bill they hope President Reagan will be forced to sign.    In June, Congress anticipated the FCC's deregulatory move and passed a measure making the Fairness Doctrine a law. President Reagan vetoed the bill, and supporters of the doctrine couldn't muster enough votes to override the veto.    The codification of the Fairness Doctrine passed overwhelmingly in Congress; the vote was 302-102 in the House and 59-31 in the Senate. The White House could have concluded that it might lose the veto fight and that it should either sign the bill or cut a face-saving deal. But the president decided to veto and ended up winning the confrontation -- weeks before Oliver North gave his stirring testimony and John Poindexter cleared the president on the diversion of funds to the Contras.    The administration will face a number of bills later this year that richly deserve the veto stamp. They include the 1,000-page protectionist trade bill, an expansion of Medicare to pay for catastrophic health care and an increase in the minimum wage. With the president's popularity polls moving north and congressional Republicans more inclined to engage in partisan battles, the administration has a good chance to win veto fights on all of these bills. It shouldn't shrink from such confrontations, and a victory on one or more of them would lay to rest suggestions that the country is being run by a lame duck.    The White House won Round One of the Fairness Doctrine debate, but its congressional backers are scheming to force a rematch. Normally failure to override a veto would dictate that the Fairness Doctrine's supporters agree it had been a fair fight and now everybody can go home. Not in this Congress. Democratic Rep. Edward J. Markey says he will attach codification of the doctrine to either the pending trade bill or the continuing resolution that allows the government to keep spending money. Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, promises to do the same in the Senate.    One of the more dramatic moments of the Iran-Contra hearings came when GOP Rep. Henry Hyde objected to committee Democrats displaying a blown-up copy of the Boland amendment with President Reagan's signature at the bottom. Rep. Hyde pointed out that Boland was part of a telephone-book-thick continuing resolution that had been sent to the president 12 days into the new fiscal year. He either had to swallow the Boland amendment or veto the entire resolution and shut down the government.    Senator Hollings and Rep. Markey want to put President Reagan in that bind again by attaching their Fairness Doctrine parasite to a similar bill. This flimflam makes a mockery of the president's constitutional right to veto legislation he opposes.    The &quot;fairness doctrine&quot; that really needs to be written into law is one that forces Congress to play by the rules. That will happen when the president has line-item power to veto individual portions of bills. Only then will the executive be able to block the enactment of legislation through constant gimmickry and stealth. </TEXT></DOC>
