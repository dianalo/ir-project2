Mr. Goble works for Mr. Baker at the State Department. Heis the department's, and probably America's, leading experton Soviet nationalities. He reads 11 of 15 languages spokenin Soviet Central Asia, and was predicting publicly two yearsago that the Soviet Union would unravel.</LP><TEXT>   But in all his time at the State Department, Mr. Goble hasnever met with his boss -- even though he was in Estonia whenMr. Baker roared through on his recent whirlwind visit to theBaltic states.   Rosemarie Forsythe is another top State expert on theSoviet nationalities. She has traveled extensively across theSoviet Union, hired a private tutor to teach her thelanguages of Turkmenia and Uzbekistan, and developed suchextensive sources that the presidents of Georgia and severalother republics invited her to attend their parliamentarysessions on independence.   When she was assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Ms.Forsythe would occasionally help prepare Mr. Baker formeetings with Soviet officials. But last month, Ms. Forsythewas transferred to Canberra, Australia. The State Departmentsays, &quot;It was a regular rotation of assignments.&quot;   The massive changes sweeping the Soviet Union since lastmonth's abortive coup caught the Bush administrationflat-footed. Even as the balance of Soviet power shifted tothe leaders of the 12 remaining republics, the administrationinitially clung to a Moscow-oriented approach, encouragingthe retention of a significant central authority. Onepossible reason is that it has largely ignored the handful ofspecialists in and out of government who have been urging itfor some time to focus on the politics and problems of thediverse republics.   So far, Mr. Bush is still basking in the reflectedpolitical glory of communism's collapse. But critics warnthat there will be trouble ahead for the U.S. if it doesn'tunderstand that what plays in St. Petersburg may beunacceptable in Uzbekistan.   &quot;I'm sure, given what Bush is doing and saying, that hedoesn't understand what's happening,&quot; asserts MarshallGoldman, associate director of the Russian Research Center atHarvard University. &quot;The advice has been very poor.&quot;   Adds Condoleezza Rice, a former National Security Councilspecialist on the Soviet Union who is now at StanfordUniversity: &quot;If you aren't familiar with these regions, youmight design aid programs that are fine for Moscow but fauxpas in the republics.&quot;   The State Department insists that it does listen to thespecialists. In the aftermath of last month's coup, theadministration has begun paying more attention to therepublics; Mr. Baker met with a wide variety of leadersduring his recent trip to the Soviet Union. Officials say twoof Mr. Baker's senior aides talk regularly with Mr. Goble.   Still, department spokesmen acknowledge that Mr. Goblewasn't among the U.S. officials either present at Mr. Baker'sbrief meetings with Estonia's president and prime minister ortraveling on the secretary's plane. On his own, Mr. Goblespent several hours last week with the Estonian president,chatting together in a sauna. Estonia's foreign ministercalls Mr. Goble &quot;the greatest student of Estonian history.&quot;   According to State officials, the department's Bureau ofIntelligence and Research has only two full-time staffers andone part-timer gathering information on all the non-Russianrepublics -- which have a population of about 150 millionpeople. At the same time, the amount of available informationhas multiplied substantially. The U.S. government's ForeignBroadcast Information Service, a daily publication thatprovides English translations of overseas newspaper reportsand broadcasts, has grown to more than 100 pages daily forthe Soviet Union edition, up from an average of about 30pages a few months ago.   Jack Matlock, who retired last month as U.S. ambassador tothe Soviet Union, says he raised the lack-of-expertise issuein the earliest days of the Bush administration. Shortlyafter President Bush's inauguration, the diplomat recalls, heurged the president to expand diplomatic contacts to therepublics. The president's response, he says, was, &quot;Greatidea -- let's move that way.&quot;   But Mr. Matlock says that, lacking any high-levelfollow-through, the idea soon fell victim to bureaucraticopposition and inertia. For instance, the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation warned that establishing diplomatic missions inthe republics would lead the Soviets to demand the right tosend more personnel here, creating additionalcounterintelligence headaches for the bureau.   It was only last spring that the administration took asmall step toward establishing ties to the republics,proposing that the U.S. Embassy in Moscow rent storefronts invarious outlying regions and send socalled &quot;circuit riders&quot;from the embassy to visit with local politicians. But whenMr. Matlock left his over lease during his 4 1/2-year tenure.   &quot;The difficulty was getting the senior people {inWashington} to understand the dynamics of what was going on,&quot;the ambassador says. &quot;There was a feeling at the top thatanything we did with the republics would upset the center. Ithink this was not the case.&quot;   The result of the bureaucratic inertia is that the U.S. isnow faced with a host of issues for which it is unprepared.Mark Saroyan, a Harvard University specialist in Sovietethnic politics, cites the republic of Georgia. Currently,the republic is run by a harshly authoritarian regime; theU.S. must decide whether, as a counterweight, it should tryto bolster the more moderate Popular Front of Georgia.   The administration's problems are compounded by thescarcity of experts on the Soviet republics and ethnicgroups. Throughout the Cold War, two generations of U.S.specialists built their careers by becoming experts inU.S.-Soviet arms-control issues, or becoming Sovietologistswho could divine meaning from the order in which Sovietofficials lined up on the Kremlin wall to view parades onnational holidays. Mr. Goble once joked that at seminars onSoviet issues, sessions on his specialty often were scheduledearly on Sunday mornings.   Even now, though, the department is adding only a handfulof new jobs to handle the ever-expanding task of monitoringthe republics. The Soviet Affairs Office has increased thenumber of experts on nationalities to four from three a yearago, according to an official, and the department also plansto add to its embassy in Moscow six new foreign-serviceofficers who would augment the circuit-rider program.   Meanwhile, the bureaucracy at State Departmentheadquarters just sent out an urgent notice to allforeign-service personnel in the building. Anyone able tospeak such languages as Uzbeki and Kazakh, the notice said,should please contact their personnel counselor as soon aspossible.</TEXT></DOC>
