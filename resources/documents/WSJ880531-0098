The profits of the 13 city, or commercial, banks also received a big boost from the sale of securities to help raise loan-loss reserves, a move aimed at shoring up the banks' exposure to Third World debt. The results also showed the start of a new emphasis on profitability through higher-yielding loans. Japanese bankers concede they will eventually have to slow the growth in lending volume.    Japan's long-term credit banks also registered record earnings, helped by the redemption of high coupon-bearing debentures issued five years ago, and the heavy capital-spending needs of corporations responding to Japan's booming economy. Long-term credit banks were initially established to make long-term loans to help rebuild Japanese industry; in recent years, they have diversified into other banking services.    Among the city banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the world's biggest bank in terms of assets, replaced Fuji Bank Ltd. as Japan's most profitable bank. Dai-Ichi Kangyo posted unconsolidated, or parent-company, pretax profit of 295.17 billion yen ($2.37 billion), up 43% from 205.91 billion yen the year before, and its unconsolidated net income rose 34%, to 133.21 billion yen ($1.07 billion) from 99.15 billion yen.    Fuji Bank fell to No. 3 among the city banks, while Sumitomo Bank Ltd. rose to No. 2. But Fuji Bank continued to post the largest operating profit among the city banks: 200.03 billion yen, up 5.2% from 190.20 billion yen.    Sumitomo Bank's performance represented a recovery from the difficulties it faced digesting Heiwa Sogo Bank, a troubled institution with many nonperforming loans that Sumitomo acquired in 1986. Sumitomo posted a 59% rise in pretax profit, to 288.55 billion yen from 181.13 billion yen. Its international operations brought in more than 100 billion yen of earnings for the first time. Only Bank of Tokyo Ltd., which specializes in international lending, posted a higher profit on foreign operations among the city banks.    Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. dropped one slot to No. 4, while Sanwa Bank Ltd. remained the country's fifth-largest bank in terms of profit.    The primary reason for last year's increase in profitability was the booming Japanese economy. Much of the economic expansion resulted from sharply rising domestic demand, fueled by individual spending and capital investment by business.    This growth has benefited the banks with the strongest domestic presence, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo, which has a network of 360 branches, Japan's largest. Most of the banks specifically have targeted marketing campaigns at profitable small companies. (Separately, Dai-Ichi Kangyo said it will name Ichiro Nakamura, now a vice president, as chairman, succeeding Tetsuya Fujimori. Kuniji Miyazaki, also a vice president, will become president, succeeding Nobuya Hagura.)    The increased sale of securities last year came in response to a decision by the Finance Ministry to allow banks to raise their reserves to 10% from 5% in an attempt to reduce the risks of their exposure to developing-country debt. Some sales were attributed to laws requiring that banks reduce holdings in other companies to no more than 5%.    The results also showed a new emphasis on banks' return on assets as opposed to their traditional focus on asset growth. The shift responds to a pending decision by the Bank of International Settlements to require banks to raise their capital-to-assets ratio to 8% by 1992. Bank assets are mainly made up of loans, cash and securities. Bank capital primarily comprises shareholders' equity and retained earnings and certain forms of debt.    The new guideline means Japanese banks must either restrain the growth of assets or increase their net worth. But because it is difficult to increase capital as fast as assets are expanding, Japanese bankers and analysts say the banks can't help but be more selective in their lending. A spokesman for Sanwa Bank acknowledged that the banks &quot;have been shifting their policy to one with more stress on return on assets.&quot;    Last week, the Finance Ministry announced a plan to allow city banks to reduce their risk assets by securitizing home loans. That proposal, which is likely to be approved in early June, follows a February decision permitting the banks to issue yen convertible bonds.    In the past, Japanese banks have tried to offset shrinking profit margins by increasing volume, and for years their total assets have shown annual gains averaging more than 10%. Asset growth continued at about that pace last year -- even higher at some institutions -- but analysts assert that that must change in the future.    According to local news reports, the city banks now are contemplating trimming unprofitable customers. For example, Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported recently that Mitsubishi Bank compiled a list of more than 100 less-profitable corporate customers to be dropped.    Analysts predict the banks ultimately may be forced to raise huge amounts of money by offering equities and convertible bonds to meet the BIS requirements. (However, they said last year's sale of securities wasn't related to the need to meet the BIS guidelines.) One Japanese banking magazine estimated that the funds Japanese banks with overseas operations will have to raise could total about eight trillion yen even if their total assets grow an average of 8% a year.    Still, banks in the past few years have benefited from low borrowing costs -- the central bank's discount rate currently is 2.5%, and low interest rates on small deposits -- and bankers are optimistic they will have little trouble raising funds if necessary.    On the other hand, there is concern in Japan's capital markets about the potential impact of huge fund-raising operations by the banks. But so far, there hasn't been any concrete move in connection with the BIS decision, partly because many of the major banks raised their equity capital last year. Japanese bank officials say they have to raise capital but the amount and the timing are still to be decided.    Here are the results for the five largest city banks:   --Dai-Ichi Kanygo Bank Ltd.: Pretax profit, 295.17 billion yen, up 43% from 205.91 billion yen; net income, 133.21 billion yen, up 34% from 99.15 billion yen; revenue, 2.448 trillion yen, up 19% from 2.051 trillion yen; return-on-asset ratio, 0.635%, up from 0.495%.    --Sumitomo Bank Ltd: Pretax profit, 288.55 billion yen, up 59% from 181.13 billion yen; net income, 111.24 billion yen, up 94% from 57.41 billion yen; revenue, 2.443 trillion yen, up 27% from 1.921 trillion yen; return-on-asset ratio, 0.654%, up from 0.469%.    --Fuji Bank Ltd.: Pretax profit, 284.23 billion yen, up 30% from 218.89 billion yen; net income, 128.02 billion yen, up 27% from 101.05 billion yen; revenue, 2.120 trillion yen, up 15% from 1.843 trillion yen; return-on-asset ratio, 0.656%, up from 0.586%.    --Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.: Pretax profit, 282.33 billion yen, up 46% from 194.09 billion yen; net income, 121.04 billion yen, up 29% from 93.58 billion yen; revenue, 2.137 trillion yen, up 24% from 1.725 trillion yen; return-on-asset ratio, 0.664%, up from 0.557%.    --Sanwa Bank Ltd.: Pretax profit, 264.38 billion yen, up 47% from 180.19 billion yen; net income, 114.53 billion yen, up 24% from 92.24 billion yen; revenue, 1.967 trillion yen, up 17% from 1.681 trillion yen; return-on-asset ratio, 0.656%, up from 0.527%.
