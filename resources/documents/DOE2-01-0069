We observe a strong anisotropy in themagnetic field dependence of the attenuation for the two polarizations.Using a simple phenomenological model, we can understand the low-temperaturefield dependence as a natural consequence of the anisotropy with temperaturein zero field reported earlier [Phys. Rev. Lett. 56, 1078 (1986)]. However,for increasing temperatures there are significant deviations from thismodel. In no case do we find evidence for new superconducting phasesin a magnetic field.</TEXT></DOC>
