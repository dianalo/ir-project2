The loss was so stunning, the city never tried again. And SanJose Water Works, founded by Donald McKenzie in 1866, continued to be themajor water supplier in the Santa Clara Valley. Last month, the companycelebrated its 125th year.;   McKenzie, owner of the San Jose Foundry, startedit with the water tanks at his foundry at First and San Antonio streets.Incorporated on Nov. 21, 1866, the firm found an immediate demand for theclear, pure water it provided through pipes laid under First and Santa Clarastreets.;   McKenzie recognized the potential. Within two years, the companyincreased its capital stock from $100,000 to $300,000, a stunning amount at atime when four loaves of bread cost a quarter and the water company was paying$10 a month to rent its offices.;   But McKenzie also recognized that wellsalone would not supply the flourishing community. The firm began buying upland in the Santa Cruz Mountains and, by 1870, building reservoirs to capturerainfall and a flume to carry the runoff down the hills. By 1872, thefledgling company began turning a profit, paying out dividends totaling$1,500.;   During the last quarter of the 19th century, the firm continued togrow, increasing its mountain holdings to 7,000 acres, building four morereservoirs and expanding its service area.;   The then-bountiful water supplydidn't escape the notice of other areas where water wasn't so plentiful. Inthe early years of this century, Bay Cities Water Co. began buying up landsouth and east of San Jose, hoping to capture the abundant Coyote Creek supplyand ship it through a pipeline to Oakland.;   That time, everyone in thevalley was on the same side: San Jose officials and ranchers joined the watercompany to fight off the attempt to take water.;   In 1934, the city tried towin approval for a local agency that would contract with a firm promising toimport water from the Sierra. The city would pay the firm $600,000 a year for30 years, slightly less than the amount the water company was making annually.At the end of the contract, the local agency, led by San Jose, would own thewater company.;   Opponents, chiefly the water company, questioned where themoney would come from to pay operating expenses of the new water provider. Themeasure lost, but by only 240 votes, a margin small enough to keep cityinterest high.;   Before the fateful 1938 election, a poll commissioned by thecity revealed that about three-fourths of those responding favored buying thewater company. But a poll sponsored by McEnery's group showed residentsoverwhelmingly against it.;   City Manager Clarence Goodwin lobbied for buyingthe water company by vowing to manage it as efficiently as the police and firedepartments. That, McEnery retorted, is &quot;exactly what we are afraid of.&quot;;  When the dust settled, the city had lost big and the water company's futurewas assured.;   Today, San Jose Water Co. is one of the largest privatelyowned water companies in the nation, serving most of San Jose, part ofCupertino and all of Los Gatos, Monte Sereno and Saratoga -- 203,000 hookupsand 750,000 customers.;   It has kept pace with the growth in the valley. Ithas continued to be profitable.;   And no one has tried to buy it lately.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOANNE GRANT, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  741  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 2, 199100337196,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
