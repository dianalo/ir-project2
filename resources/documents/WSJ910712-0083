But do they work?   Though statistics are scarce, people who write, publishand design newsletters report that a growing number of ownersare using them to build business. Steven Klinghoffer, ownerof a Springfield, N.J., newsletter publisher, says hisprofessional subscriber list -- lawyers, accountants,small-business people and others who buy his newsletters togive to their own customers -- has grown tenfold in sevenyears to 2,800. Polly Pattison, a Westminster, Calif.,designer who gives seminars on newsletters, says, &quot;Moreentrepreneurs are realizing that educating the buyer is asimportant as seducing the buyer.&quot;   Real-estate agents, chiropractors, landscapers andflorists are mailing off missives. Illinois Center DentalAssociates in Chicago pays $3,000 yearly for a bulletin itdistributes to patients; a recent issue included articles on&quot;Composite Fillings for Whiter Smiles&quot; and &quot;The Life Cycle ofPlaque.&quot;   But newsletters may have limited impact. &quot;The morenewsletters people receive, the less likely they are to readthe information,&quot; says Gary Siegel, president of a Chicagomarket-research firm. Mr. Siegel recently surveyed 100Chicago executives on how legal newsletters affect theirchoice of a law firm. On a scale of 0 (&quot;no influence&quot;) to 100(&quot;very influential&quot;), the ratings averaged 20.                                                                                                          Family-Firm Consultants   Aim to Adopt Standards                                                                                                          WITH SPECIALISTS from shrinks to insurance salesmenflooding the lucrative field of family-business consulting,the industry hopes to professionalize itself.   The Family Firm Institute, a group of family-businessconsultants and owners based in Johnstown, N.Y., is trying todevise guidelines on ethics, training and credentials formembers.   Among the issues they aim to address is when and howprofessionals should realize their limits. Thomas Davidow, apsychologist and consultant who is co-chairman of aninstitute task force on standards, says: &quot;I should no morehelp a family create an estate plan than a lawyer oraccountant should work with a family laced with alcohol.&quot;   A related item: Should consultants take fees for referringother professionals to their clients? No, Mr. Davidow says,because that can create conflicts between the interests ofconsultants and those of their clients.   Family-business owners applaud the effort. Charles Fradin,president of Copley Distributors, a Rhode Island liquordistributor, says it's often difficult for owners to verify aconsultant's record because prior clients refuse to discusshow they were helped.   George Berkowitz, president of Legal Seafoods in Allston,Mass., says he and many entrepreneurs make the mistake ofthinking consultants can &quot;cure&quot; a business of familyflare-ups. Usually, he says, &quot;there is no cure&quot;; consultantscan only help family businesses live with problems. So,consultants must be ethical enough to cut off their incomestream and say to a client: &quot;You're OK now. You don't need meanymore.&quot;                                                                                                          Accounting, Franchising   May Not Make a Good Mix                                                                                                          ADVISING COMPANIES on how to franchise themselves is atricky business. Just ask Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.   The big accounting firm, based in Chicago, is partingcompany with its top franchising consultant, Craig S. Slavin,hired in 1989 to start its franchising practice. Mr. Slavin,who formerly headed his own consulting firm, says, &quot;It was amutual parting of the ways.&quot; He won't elaborate. An ArthurAndersen spokesman says the firm doesn't comment on personnelmatters.   But the entrepreneurial spirit of franchising and thedeliberate nature of a big accounting firm may not be a goodmatch. One client, Andreas Vassilos, president of Brite Sitecleaning service in Chicago, says, &quot;I don't think Craig{Slavin} knew how to handle the different departments inArthur Andersen. And I don't think Arthur Andersen was fullyaware of the scope of the projects they were getting involvedin.&quot;   Mr. Vassilos says Arthur Andersen selected his company in1989 as a model client for testing its franchise consulting.But the firm's delays in handling his project made him&quot;antsy,&quot; he says, and he considered shopping elsewhere forhelp. He had planned to start selling franchises this summer,but now must wait until fall.   Mr. Slavin says his handling of departments and clientshad &quot;nothing to do&quot; with his leaving. Arthur Andersen says ithas added more people to the pilot project, and &quot;the client'sobjectives . . . are currently being met.&quot; The firm recentlypromoted Leonard N. Swartz, a former franchise industryexecutive, to succeed Mr. Slavin.   Another Big 6 firm is stepping more gingerly into thefranchise-consulting waters: Price Waterhouse is teaming upwith S.H. Development Group, a two-person franchiseconsulting firm in Hartford, Conn. The companies aim to referclients back and forth and to work together on consultingprojects.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SMALL BUSINESSES still lag behind big ones in providingemployee benefits. A recent Labor Department survey findsthat 69% of small businesses last year provided medical carebenefits for full-time workers; an earlier poll found that,in 1989, 92% of large businesses did so. . . . The AmericanRed Cross recently interviewed 1,000 small firms andnonprofit groups regarding their policies on employees withAIDS. One-third said they would apply either their standarddisability policies or AIDS-specific policies.</TEXT></DOC>
