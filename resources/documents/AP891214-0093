Bulgarians had widely expected the legislature to approve arequest by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to strike aclause from the Constitution guaranteeing the party's leading role.   After state radio announced the decision to defer discussion onthe motion for a month, more than 20,000 protesters outsideParliament became angry.   ``We are here!'' the demonstrators shouted in unison to theCommunist deputies inside. ``Come on out!''   Officials justified the decision by citing a little-known lawstating that any motion to change the Constitution must be acted onnot less than a month after it is made but no later than threemonths afterward.   On Wednesday, the party's governing Central Committee closed athree-day meeting by voting to propose that Parliament strike twoclauses from the constitution that enshrine the party's ``leadingrole.''   If the proposal had been adopted by Parliament, Romania and theSoviet Union would have become the only Warsaw Pact countries wherethe Communists' political supremacy is legally guaranteed.   The Bulgarian party also expelled former hard-line leader TodorZhivkov from the party he ran unchallenged for 35 years until hisouster last month, opening the possibility that Zhivkov could beprosecuted for corruption.   In other developments regarding Eastern Europe today:   _East Germany met another opposition demand by abolishing theagency that controls the country's once-feared secret police.   _In Brussels, the 16 NATO foreign ministers approved the draftof a treaty to that sets a ceiling of 275,000 for U.S. and Soviettroops on foreign soil and sharp cutbacks in tanks, artillery andother non-nuclear weapons. The NATO llies also considered a U.S.plan that would gradually extend NATO's mission to the politicalarena to better cope with the reforms in Eastern Europe.   Petar Mladenov _ who replaced Zhivkov as Bulgaria's party chiefand has charted a reform course _ told the Central Committeemeeting on Wednesday to prepare for free elections in May.   ``We have to ... conquer _ this time in the real sense of theword _ the hearts and minds of the millions of Bulgarians.   ``Soon we will face a nationwide exam: free and democraticelections ... and it is there we must show that we are not onlyworthy of, but also practically capable of, leading'' the country.   Some of Mladenov's remarks at the closing session were carriedby BTA, the official news agency.   Mladenov, who served as foreign minister for 18 years underZhivkov, has moved swiftly to oust associates of his predecessorfrom the party's ruling Politburo in favor of people more likely toembrace reform.   Politburo member Andrei Lukanov told a news conference Wednesdaythat the Central Committee would call also on Parliament to draft anew electoral law ``guaranteeing the possibility of holding freeand democratic elections next year.'' Lukanov, considered second inthe new hierarchy after Mladenov, said the Communists were readyfor dialogue with ``all public forces and movements in Bulgaria.''   Asked if the party was willing to go into the opposition if itloses the elections, Lukanov said, ``We have to wait and see.Elections, for a party, are there to be won, and we aspire to winthem.''   At a Communist-sponsored rally Wednesday evening, about 60,000people cheered Mladenov when he told them that party had decided toscrap its guaranteed leading role.   This has been a key demand of the opposition, for whichthousands of people expressed support in recent days by joining inmass rallies.   ``Our glorious party doesn't need this (guarantee) anymore,''Mladenov told the rally outside party headquarters. ``Without it wecan win.''   In a speech to the Central Committee on Monday, Mladenov saidthe party should start talks with independent groups immediatelyand relinquish the guarantee of sole power, as has been done thisyear in Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Heproposed that free elections be held by May.   Lukanov said the decision to expel Zhivkov from the party wasunanimous. He said the former leader was ousted for ``grossviolations of laws and gross mistakes in politics which brought thecountry to a serious crisis.''   There have been widespread calls for the 78-year-old Zhivkov tobe prosecuted for corruption and abuses of power during hisautocratic rule.   Zhivkov has been accused publicly of living lavishly in aworkers' state, in 13 opulent official residences and six huntinglodges. His son, Vladimir, and Milko Balev, a close associate, werealso thrown out of the party.   Officials say the residences and lodges will be turned over tothe public.</TEXT></DOC>
