Edelman, the New York investor, and Dominion Textile Inc. pressed Burlington Industries Inc. to give them the opportunity to top any competing bid for the company.    In a letter to Frank S. Greenberg, chairman of Burlington, Mr. Edelman and Montreal-based Dominion told the Greensboro, N.C.-based company that it should &quot;give us the opportunity to review and improve upon any bona fide offer that you receive and which you intend to accept as superior to our offer.&quot;    As previously reported, last Friday Mr. Edelman and Dominion sweetened their hostile takeover offer for Burlington to $72 a share from $67 a share offered May 5.    In the letter, the Edelman-Dominion partnership told Mr. Greenberg that the only response they received after the sweetened bid &quot;has been statements from your advisers to the effect that if we intend to increase our price further, we should do so immediately.&quot; The partners said the &quot;clear implication&quot; was that Burlington expected to &quot;receive and accept another offer in the near future.&quot;    The disclosure of the letter's reference to the possibility of another offer helped to drive up the price of Burlington's stock to exceed the $72-a-share tender offer by the Edelman-Dominion partnership. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Burlington's stock jumped $1.625 yesterday to close at $73.25 a share.    Some traders said that based on the letter, they believed that a bid for Burlington would surface quickly. And there were strong rumors that Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, the leveraged buyout unit of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. had made a $75-a-share bid for Burlington. But by late yesterday, the rumors appeared suspect.    While Merrill Lynch officials weren't available to comment on the speculation, individuals familiar with Burlington said that the company wasn't close to signing a pact with Merrill. Merrill was understood, however, to have been included in a group of leveraged buyout firms that have looked at the company. Others include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., Forstmann Little andamp; Co. and Gibbons Green Van Amerongen, all based in New York.    Burlington's board met in New York yesterday for several hours. A source close to the board said the company hasn't yet received any bids other than that of Mr. Edelman and Dominion. But the board is understood to have been briefed on the company's negotiations with several potential buyers, and is said to have discussed various restructuring alternatives.    A Burlington spokesman said the company had no comment on the letter from Mr. Edelman and Dominion, and declined to say whether the Burlington board considered any specific proposal. &quot;As it has been, the board is meeting to consider all the alternatives in due course,&quot; he said.    Last week, the textile concern said it had begun &quot;preliminary discussions&quot; with &quot;third parties&quot; in connection with a possible restructuring. It said those parties included certain leveraged buyout groups and that any transaction could include members of Burlington's management. </TEXT></DOC>
