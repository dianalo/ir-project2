<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0506 </DOCNO><TEXT>In an electron-polarised-photon coincidence experiment we have measuredthe linear and circular polarisation of the 3/sup 1/D -andgt; 2/sup 1/P decayradiation (667.8) emitted upon electron impact excitation of the 3/sup1/D state of helium. Only photons emitted perpendicular to the scatteringplane have been detected. From the experimental data, target parametersare extracted which characterise the excited 3/sup 1/D state. We performedthis experiment for incident-electron energies of 60, 45 40 and 36 eVand scattering angles between 31.2 and 50/sup 0/. The results are comparedwith a recent first-order many-body theory calculation.</TEXT></DOC>
