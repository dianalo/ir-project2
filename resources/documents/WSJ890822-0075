IRNA, in a report citing comments by Iran's ambassador to Japan in yesterday's edition of Tehran Times, said that the offer by the group led by Mitsui andamp; Co. was rejected by Iran pending further negotiations.    Ambassador Hussein Adeli, in comments to the English-language daily, said, &quot;The Japanese side accepted to pay $1.25 billion to Iran for the settlement of their account and to withdraw their partnership.&quot;    He added that Iran wanted to continue the partnership and to complete the plant in southern Iran.    Mr. Adeli said the Japanese agreed to pay Iran after talks over resumption of the 15-year-old joint venture between the Iranian National Petrochemical Co. and the Mitsui-led group began late last year. It didn't indicate when the actual sum was offered.    IRNA noted that a senior Mitsui official is expected to visit Tehran shortly to &quot;finalize talks&quot; on the unfinished joint-venture plant, known as the Iran-Japan Petrochemical Co. </TEXT></DOC>
