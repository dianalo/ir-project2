Currently, the maker of floor coverings and building products buys the glass fiber ceiling materials from other makers. Armstrong said it leased a building in Hilliard, Ohio, for the manufacturing of glass fiber ceiling panels for residential and commercial use. The company said the new operation will have about 65 employees.    Armstrong said it will use various assets purchased from Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Toledo, Ohio, to make the glass fiber ceilings. As previously reported, Armstrong bought a closed plant and other equipment, patents and trademarks from Owens-Corning. </TEXT></DOC>
