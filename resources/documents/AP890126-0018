The defense in the Iran-Contra case wants Reps. Lee Hamilton,D-Ind., and Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., to testify in court about theirdealings with North in 1985 and 1986 on the subject of whether theUnited States was aiding the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua'sleftist Sandinista government.   ``I'm willing to cooperate to the extent I have any directknowledge,'' McCurdy said Wednesday in a brief interview. He said heassumed the defense was primarily interested in his account of anAug. 6, 1986, meeting of House Intelligence Committee members withNorth in the White House situation room.   Hamilton had no comment on the subpoena. But when broadconspiracy charges against North were dropped earlier this month,Hamilton said the remaining counts amounted to a strong criminalcase against the retired Marine lieutenant colonel. The remainingcounts against North include charges of lying to Congress.   Two Intelligence Committee staff members also have beensubpoenaed by North's lawyers, along with documents from theIntelligence, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees.   At the White House meeting with lawmakers in August 1986, Northconcealed the U.S. role in resupplying the Nicaraguan rebels, andadmitted when he testified before congressional investigatingcommittees in 1987 that he had done so.   But North's defense apparently intends to show that Congress knewabout the supply effort, either from other sources or frominformation disclosed by North himself on other occasions, accordingto the House response.   McCurdy, however, said he he knew nothing about North'sinvolvement with the resupply effort until disclosure of theIran-Contra scandal three months after the White House meeting.   In a 22-page motion to quash portions of the subpoenas fordocuments, House counsel Steven R. Ross argued that they were toobroad and based on an ``incredible'' theory that North was onlyconcealing things the committees already knew.   North ``reasons that hence no crimes occurred, for what the Houseknew, North could not conceal from it,'' the motion argued.``Congress has not legalized obstruction ... on the grounds thatothers may make up the truth deficit.''   At a court hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesellsaid subpoenaing congressmen must be approached with ``some degreeof accommodation'' and that ``we're not going to pull them off thefloor'' of Congress to testify at North's trial, which is scheduledto begin Tuesday.   At the time of the White House meeting, Hamilton was IntelligenceCommittee chairman and McCurdy was a member of the panel. Hamiltonis no longer a member, but McCurdy recently rejoined the committee.   A hearing was scheduled for Friday to hear all objections toNorth's subpoenas, including those seeking testimony from formerPresident Reagan and President Bush.   In his motion to quash parts of the document subpoenas, Ross saidthe House cannot be compelled to submit its investigative files tooutside inquiries, but would be willing to do so where the materialis relevant to prosecution or defense of charges involving crimeswhere the House is a victim.   ``We have no desire to withhold evidence which is material andrelevant,'' Ross said.   North was seeking everything the House committees have regardingproviding support to the Contras by private benefactors, thirdcountries, John Singlaub, Robert Owen, who was North's courier tothe Contras, and co-defendant Richard Secord, whom North enlisted torun the resupply operation.   North subpoenaed the whole set of records of the intelligencepanel's probe of the Contra resupply operation, which began after aContra resupply plane with American crewman Eugene Hasenfus aboardwas shot down in Nicaragua in October 1986.   Four of the 12 criminal charges remaining against North are thatin 1985 he concealed from Congress his efforts on behalf of theContras to raise funds, arrange arms shipments and offer tacticaladvice.   Another count says he concealed similar information at the WhiteHouse meeting, and he is charged additionally with obstructingCongress in November 1986 by altering, destroying and concealingdocuments on the Iran arms shipments and aid to the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
