<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0939 </DOCNO><TEXT>Oxygen incorporation and subsequent oxidation of ion-implanted siliconhave been performed using repetitive pulsed excimer laser irradiationworking in the liquid phase regime. The kinetics of the oxidation andthe characterization of the grown SiO{sub 2} were investigated by infraredspectroscopy. The origin of the broadening of the Si-O stretching bandof these oxides grown from the liquid phase is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
