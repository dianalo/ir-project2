(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge temporarily restored drivingprivileges today to a teen-age father-to-be whose license wasrevoked because he dropped out of school.   Circuit Judge Paul Zakaib Jr. set aside Michael Means' licenserevocation for 30 days while lawyers file briefs and the judge makesa decision.   Means, 17, who dropped out in ninth grade last year, is appealingthe loss of his license May 30 under a first-of-its-kind law aimedat curbing truancy in a state where the dropout rate is around 17percent.   Under the law passed last summer, students under 18 who miss morethan 10 consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absenceslose their driving privileges.   Means, whose 16-year-old wife, Tonya, is expecting their firstchild this fall, sued on June 8, the first time the law has beenchallenged in court. His father said the teen-ager cannot supporthis growing family without a license.   The law allows school boards to grant hardship exceptions, butstate officials maintain that the teen-ager could hold a job andstill complete his education.   Educators have praised the legislation, saying its bringsteen-agers back to school, but Means' lawyer, Chris Butch, hasargued that it conflicts with another law allowing students to dropout at 16. He called the law ridiculous.   ``It says you're poor, you dropped out of high school, and nowwe're going to punish you some more,'' Butch said.   Several states, including Wisconsin and Texas, where Gov. BillClements signed a dropout bill into law Friday, have similar laws.   The judge today Zakaib said Means keep his driving privileges ifhe enrolls in a high school equivalency course and makessatisfactory progress.   ``I think they're trying to force me to go into a GED program andI don't like being forced to do anything,'' Means said after thehearing.</TEXT></DOC>
