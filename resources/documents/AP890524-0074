In a separate case, two black men,including a member of the outlawed African National Congress,received reprieves to apply for a new trial.   Lawyers for Human Rights, which appealed to President P.W. Bothafor stays of execution, said Minister of Justice Kobie Coetseeissued stays late Tuesday for the blacks. They were convicted ofkilling a black policeman in February, 1986 by placing a burningtire around his neck.   The lawyers' group asked for a retrial for one of the men, ANCmember Sibusiso Senele Masuku, 22, because, they said, new evidencehad been found that state witnesses may have been forced to givefalse evidence against him.   The other defendant given a reprieve was Oupa Josias Mbonane, 20.   The two white men who were hanged at Pretoria Central Prisonwere convicted in separate cases of murder and robbery of whitevictims. One of them had not filed any appeals and had asked forhis execution date to be moved up, lawyers said.   Four more men were scheduled to hang Thursday, and appeals forreprieves were pending.   Meanwhile, the appellate division of the Supreme Court inBloemfontein, Orange Free State, set aside the convictions of sixblack men sentenced to death in June, 1987, for the 1985 slaying ofan 18-year-old black woman.   One of the convicted men has since died of natural causes.   The appellate court ordered the other three released from prisontoday, saying the court that tried the four had been improperlyconstituted.   The ruling brought to 13 the number of condemned men whose deathsentences and convictions have been overturned since September.   In an unrelated matter, police said an African National Congressguerrilla shot himself to death after wounding a black woman andshooting a policeman in the chest on Tuesday. Police did notidentify the dead man. They said the shootings occurred nearNelspruit, in Natal province.   The ANC is the largest guerrilla group fighting to oust thewhite-dominated government.</TEXT></DOC>
