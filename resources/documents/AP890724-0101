State and federal inspectors have been trying to determine ifchemicals and fiberglass-like composite materials used to make theradar-evading bomber pose a health threat to Boeing employees.   Washington Department of Labor and Industries spokeswomanBarbara Dunn said last week that two state inspectors have madeabout five visits to Boeing's Developmental Center and expect tomake more.   Two inspectors from U.S. Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration also are examining parts of the south Seattle plant.   While the original inspection focused on the compositematerials, the state's effort has been expanded to all aspects ofB-2 construction, including examining machinery and looking for anysafety hazards, Ms. Dunn said.   Air samples have been taken inside the plant to check forchemical levels, and employees are being interviewed about possibleproblems, she said.   No complaints have been received from workers at thehigh-security plant, Ms. Dunn said, adding, ``We just want to makesure that we're covering all the bases.''   Earlier this year, Lockheed Corp. was fined nearly $1.5 millionby OSHA following inspections at its Aeronautical Systems Co. plantin Burbank, Calif. That plant produces a plane technologicallysimilar to the B-2, the F-117A stealth fighter.   Boeing's work on the stealth bomber is as a subcontractor forthe main builder, Northrop Corp. of Los Angeles.   By law, Ms. Dunn said, state officials cannot release results ofthe inspection until it is complete and Boeing has been informed ofthe findings. She said the work probably will be completed by lateJuly or early August.   The plant inspection is being done at the request of Rep. NormDicks, D-Wash., who was concerned about the safety of chemicalsused in aerospace construction.   The inspection began June 6, about two weeks later thanoriginally planned. The delay occurred when the Defense Departmentdenied the state inspectors access to some of the areas becausethey did not have security clearances and OSHA inspectors had to bebrought in, Ms. Dunn said.   ``The Boeing Co. would have allowed us in. It was essentiallythe Department of Defense that denied us entry,'' she said.   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer has quoted unidentified plantworkers as saying the delay was used to clean and fix up shop areasin anticipation of the inspection.   ``The walls were wiped down, new tops were put on the tables _it was nothing like our normal working condititions,'' thenewspaper quoted one employee as saying.   ``We did not issue directives to go and do anything unusual,''said John Kvasnosky, spokesman for Boeing Advanced Systems, whichoperates the Developmental Center. The company has safety andhousekeeping operations that take place continually, he said.   Richard Terrill, assistant regional administrator for OSHA,declined to say what his inspectors were examining, citing securityreasons. But he said OSHA's role was ``very limited,'' involvingonly a small portion of the plant.   Terrill said OSHA's work should be finished in about a month.   In the past year, dozens of Boeing Commercial Airplanesemployees at an Auburn plant who worked with phenol formaldehydecomplained of a variety of ailments, ranging from dizziness andrashes to memory loss. The chemical was used to make luggage binsand other jet interior parts.   Air sampling at the plant found formaldehyde levels well withinfederal standards, but Boeing discontinued use of the chemical andimproved ventilation at the plant.   Phenol formaldehyde has not been used at Boeing AdvancedSystems, Kvasnosky said.</TEXT></DOC>
