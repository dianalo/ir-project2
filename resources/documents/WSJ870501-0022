Mr. Linh was quoted as saying that Vietsovpetro, the Vietnamese-Soviet joint venture that holds a monopoly on oil development, drew 295,650 barrels of oil from those fields during 1986's second half. The Vietnam News Agency, monitored in Bangkok, said Mr. Linh was speaking during a recent visit to the Vung Tau-Con Dao special zone, the supply base for exploration of the Bach Ho oil and natural-gas fields.    Last Friday, Vietnam made what may have been its first petroleum exports. Two major Japanese trading companies, C. Itoh andamp; Co. and Nissho Iwai Corp., said they bought a total of 562,100 barrels in spot trading on behalf of two Japanese oil-refining companies. Spokesmen for the trading companies wouldn't provide further details.    Vietnam has said it has found considerable oil deposits in the Bach Ho fields, but diplomats in Hanoi had thought there wasn't any likelihood of significant commercial exploitation. Oil exports would aid the ailing Vietnamese economy and bring in badly needed foreign exchange.    In recent years, Vietnam has tried to draw back Western and Japanese oil companies, all of which left the country by 1981. But plans were suspended because of the sharp drop in world oil prices. </TEXT></DOC>
