<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0503 </DOCNO><TEXT>An apparatus is described for continuous delivery of relatively uniformpredetermined thermal energy from a cyclically active thermal energysource having an ON period substantially exceeding an OFF period in durationto an energy utilization sector of a closed working fluid conduit loopadditionally comprising an energy supply sector, the energy supply sectorcomprising: working fluid conduit means for containment and transportof the working fluid from a lower temperature outlet of a thermal utilizationmeans to a higher temperature inlet of the thermal energy utilizationmeans; tubular outer containment means spaced from and surrounding atleast a portion of the energy supply sector of the working fluid conduitmeans forming an annular chamber between the working fluid conduit meansand the tubular outer containment means; liquid-solid phase change thermalenergy transmission and storage material having a high specific heatin the liquid phase substantially filling the annular chamber; the annularchamber having a width between the working fluid conduit means and theouter containment means and a length consistent with the continuous deliveryof relatively uniform predetermined thermal energy based upon density,heat of fusion, specific heat, and thermal conductivity of the thermaltransmission and storage material; and means for protection of the outercontainment means from thermal losses during inactivity of the periodicallyactive energy source.</TEXT></DOC>
