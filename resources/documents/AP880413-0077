(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fire at the Wharncliffe VolunteerFire Department engulfed the building before firefighters could gettheir fire truck out, officials say.   ``I was just devastated,'' said Fire Chief James Dotson.   Dotson said he arrived at the firehouse early Tuesday to find astorage building connected to the station engulfed in flames.   The firehouse was still intact, and Dotson opened the stationdoor, intending to move the engine. But the heat was so intense itdrove him back. His protective gear was of no use because it wasinside the station, too.   Firefighters from nearby Gilbert were called to Wharncliffe whenthe blaze was reported, but it took them more than 30 minutes tonegotiate the 13 miles of winding mountain roads between the towns.   By then, the station's ceiling had fallen in, and the front wallof the second floor fell in just as firefighters got into position.   ``There was no chance of saving either the truck nor any of theequipment,'' said Kendell Simpson, Gilbert's assistant fire chief.   ``I just could have cried,'' said Hazel Toler, a dispatcher inGilbert who said she saw the fire as she drove to work.   The fire probably was caused by old wiring, authorities said.   Wharncliffe's fire truck and $50,000 worth of equipment weredestroyed, officials said. No one was in the building when the firebegan and no one was injured.   Firefighters managed to save a 1958 2,000-gallon tanker that wasbeing repaired, Dotson said.   Simpson said Gilbert's fire department will cover Wharncliffeuntil it returns to operation, expected within a week.</TEXT></DOC>
