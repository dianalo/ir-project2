Later today, an Anglican minister negotiating between thegovernment and the rebels said a settlement was likely.   The heaviest shooting was centered on the television station,whose employees were taken hostage Friday. Automatic rifle andmachine-gun fire was punctuated by what sounded like artillerybooms.   One witness said he heard four explosions that sounded likebombs.   ``A major firefight is going on,'' said a diplomatic source, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The shooting at the station appeared to be coming from twodirections, but it was not clear whether security forces had triedto storm the building.   Earlier, automatic weapons fire rang out near Parliament, abouta mile from the television station, where rebels seized PrimeMinister Arthur N.R. Robinson on Friday. Witnesses said they heardwhat sounded like heavy artillery booms.   A ham radio operator in Trinidad said he monitored a radiocommunication indicating security forces had stormed the televisionstation and were moving on Parliament.   But Col. Ralph Brown of the Trinidad-Tobago Defense Force deniedthe station was attacked.   He told reporters that troops had fired on the TV station whenthe rebels tried to leave the building. ``Some of his men tried tocome out and we are not letting them out.''   An Anglican minister who was negotiating between the rebels andthe government, the Rev. Knolly Clarke, also spoke with reportersearly this afternoon.   When asked if a peaceful solution was likely, he said, ``Yes,today. The end is in sight.''   One of the rebels inside Parliament, Kwasi Attiba, said bytelephone that a tentative agreement with the government had beenreached to end the siege.   Attiba said the accord called for Robinson to resign immediatelyand be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Dookeran. Attibagave no indication when Robinson and other other hostages would bereleased, and no government official could be reached to confirmhis report.   An agreement was also reported Sunday by a television executive,Jones Madeira, who was held at the station. He said in a telephoneinterview that under the plan, Robinson would turn over power to aninterim government, which would rule until elections in threemonths.   Robinson won the 1986 parliamentary elections by a landslide,and the next elections are not scheduled until 1991.   The rebels claim Robinson's government is corrupt andresponsible for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich country.They claimed Saturday to have wired Robinson with explosives andthreatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made.   Attiba said the gunfire at Parliament came from police ``whohave been attempting to thwart'' negotiations.   Attiba said the rebels were holding eight government ministersalong with the prime minister.   Energy Minister Herbert Atwell said Sunday the two sides werefar from a settlement. But Attiba said: ``We are very hopeful foran amicable solution.''   Security forces patrolled the capital with orders to shootlooters on sight.   Abu Bakr, leader of a black Moslem commune, stormed Parliamenton Friday and captured Robinson and most of his Cabinet. Bakr isbelieved backed by Libya but has little general support.   Simultaneously, the rebels seized the government televisionstation and its employees.   Unconfirmed reports said more than 20 people had been killed inthe fighting. A medical officer at the state hospital said today hecould confirm only five deaths, including that of a police officer.   Fires burned in the capital of Port-of-Spain on Sunday. Therewas scattered gunfire and widespread looting. Convoys of cars andpickup trucks were loading up with everything from looted powderedmilk to refrigerators, electric stoves and television sets.   The government sent police and military patrols to re-establishorder and continued a nationwide curfew that was imposed Saturday.   Atwell, representing the government, appeared on nationaltelevision late Sunday with an official statement saying: ``I am inno position to offer any hope that the situation will be resolvedspeedily and-or amicably.''   He confirmed reports that Robinson and Justice Minister SelwynRichardson had each been shot in the leg.   State-run radio 610 said Nolli Clarke, an Anglican priest, wasthe official mediator with help from Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullahand Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Patin.   The Red Cross sent mobile units to take blood donations frompeople too frightened to leave their homes.   Radio 610 estimated damage downtown at $50 million as thousandsof people looted stores, shopping centers, warehouses andindustrial plants.   A spokeswoman for President Bush said Sunday that Americancitizens and tourists on Trinidad and Tobago did not appear to bein danger.   ``Obviously we support the government and are coordinatingclosely with them until the situation is resolved,'' a StateDepartment official said in Washington. The official did not wantto be identified.   Bakr is a former policeman in his mid-40s who converted to Islamin 1980 while living in Canada.   He founded Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group inArabic, in 1984 and set up a commune on land he said had beendonated to Moslems by the late prime minister, Eric Williams.   Bakr built a mosque, a school and a kitchen to feed thehomeless. Some 250 to 300 Moslems live there.   Bakr has visited Libya several times and is believed to havereceived assistance from that country.   He has said the coup was intended to stop ``poverty and thedestruction'' of Trinidad and Tobago, which has high unemploymentand skyrocketing food prices.</TEXT></DOC>
