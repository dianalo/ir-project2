 By expanding the command toinclude filenames and wildcards, you can also list all of your indexes (DIR*.NDX), command files (DIR *.PRG), or any other files on your system.andP;  Ineffect, you get the functionality of the DOS DIR command without exiting toDOS.andM;Creating .BAK FilesandM;dBASE III Plus automatically creates a backup file with the extension .BAKwhen you give the command MODIFY STRUCTURE from the dot prompt (or if you useShift-F2 from the Command Center while highlighting a database file).andP;  ButdBASE IV doesn't create the backup, which could mean trouble if you make amistake in the new structure of the original .DBF file and want to startover.andM;You can, however, create your own backup copy of a file by using the COPYcommand to produce a duplicate file with the name TEMP before you change and.DBF file.andP;  For example: USE .DBF FILENAME COPY TO TEMP MODIFY STRUCTUREandM;The DBSETUP command can be used to change the screen's background andforeground colors in dBASE, but it will not store the new settings toCONFIG.DB, the file that contains the permanent settings for dBASE.andP;  Thereare a couple of ways you can change the colors permanently.andM;One way is to type MODIFY COMMAND CONFIG.DB at the dot prompt and then definethe new color you want with a COLOR OF ...andP;  = statement, followed by thesettings.andP;  (You can find the legal color settings in the &quot;Commands&quot; sectionof the Language Reference manual.)andM;Another way is to delete all the COLOR OF commands from the CONFIG.DB file.andO;Then you'll be able to run DBSETUP and have it save the new settings toCONFIG.DB.andM;LOTUS 1-2-3andM;Quick Width CheckandM;In Lotus 1-2-3, it's difficult to determine how wide a report will be untilyou print it out and see if it fits on the paper.andP;  You can get a quick ideaby putting this statement in colomn A: @repeat(&quot;1234567890&quot;,25)andM;This repeats the numbers 25 times, so they'll be on the screen when youscroll to the right.andP;  Multiply by 10 the number of zeros that extend overyour report and add the number that's over the far right column to see howwide your printout will be.andM;Manual Is FasterandM;Entering data into a large Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet can be cumbersome.andP;  Theprogram often makes you wait seconds after each entry as the spreadsheetrecalculates itself.andP;  You can get around this problem by changing theprogram's recalculation feature from automatic to manual.andP;  Type the commands/WGRM (/Worksheet Global Recalculation Manual).andP;  Then the spreadsheet willrecalculate only when you press the Calc function key.andM;EXCELandM;Checking on MemoryandM;Excel limits the size of your worksheet to available RAM (conventional andexpanded memory).andP;  As a result, it pays to know exactly how much usablememory remains when you are creating a large worksheet.andM;To check the amount of remaining memory during an Excel session, simply clickon the Help option, located at the top right of the menu bar.andP;  Then selectthe About...andP;  option.andP;  A special message box appears containing version andcopyright information about Excel.andP;  At the bottom of this box, you'll find alisting of the amount of unused conventional and expanded memory left in yoursystem.andM;Conserving MemoryandM;When you start Excel from the Windows MS-DOS Executive screen by clicking onthe EXCEL.EXE filename, Excel automatically opens a blank spreadsheet calledSHEET1.andP;  Before loading any other files, select File Close from the menu barto increase the memory available for your Excel session.andM;Quick Loan FormulaandM;A variation on the Excel PMT function lets you simplify calculating loanpayments for different loan periods, principal amounts, and interest rates.andM;1.andP;  Enter the following formula in a blank cell (for example, C5):=PMT=((RATE/100/12), (TERM*12),(AMOUNT*-1))andM;2.andP;  Assign a single cell (for example, B1) the Range name RATE.andM;3.andP;  Assign a different cell (for example, B2) the Range name TERM.andM;4.andP;  Assign a third cell (for example, B3) the Range name AMOUNT.andM;Use cell B1 to enter an interest rate in percentage format, where a value of&quot;10.5&quot; would represent 10.5 percent.andP;  Dividing this value by 100 in the C5formula converts it into a percentage.andM;B2 holds the number of years for the loan.andP;  Multiplying this figure by 12 inC5 converts years into months.andM;B3 contains the amount of the loan.andP;  Multiplying this figure by -1 in the C5formula allows the PMT function, which returns a negative number, to giveyour payment as a positive value.andM;By changing the value of cells B1, B2, or B3, you can quickly review various&quot;what-if&quot; scenarios for different loan structures.andP;  For example, to changethe value in cell C5 from the monthly payment for a 20-year loan to that of a30-year loan, all other variables remaining equal, simply change the numberin cell B2 from 20 to 30.andM;WORDPERFECTandM;Compact HeadersandM;WordPerfect automatically prints a blank line between a header and the textbody to keep the header from crowding the rest of the page.andP;  But there may betimes when you want to print the header flush against the text--when usingthe header to identify the columns of data on multiple pages, for instance.andM;To eliminate the blank line, define the header--Shift-F8, Format Page (2),Headers (3), A or B, Every Page (2)--and enter what you want to appear.andP;  Thenenter the code that advances the type up one line--Shift-F8, Other (4),Advance (1), Up (1), Enter, F7.andM;Keeping Track on StylesandM;Tracking WordPerfect styles can be a headache because the software fails tooffer any built-in style organizer/manager.andP;  But you can create a handyprinted reference that lists the styles found in each .STY file or eachdocument containing styles.andM;The only problem is that you can't print from the Styles screen with theusual Shift-F7 command.andP;  Fortunately, you can send the screen image to yourprinter simply by pressing Shift-PrtSc.andP;  If you're using the program underWordPerfect Library, you can use Screen Copy (Alt-Shift-Hyphen).andP;  Either way,keep the printouts handy, and you can quickly check to see what each stylecollection is.andM;Block Define MemoryandM;It's a fact of life that WordPerfect users aren't always perfect themselves.andO;It's possible, for example, for you to turn off a block highlight beforeboldfacing, underlining, or doing whatever you meant to do with the block.andM;To quickly rehighlight the same block, press Block (Alt-F4), Ctrl-Home, andCtrl-Home again.andP;  This shortcut is also useful when you wish to use more thanone feature on the same block--say, to boldface and then center.andM;MICROSOFT WORDandM;Turn Off Hidden TextandM;Microsoft Word users should always turn off hidden text before compiling atable of contents.andP;  If hidden text is left visible, Word will include it whenpaginating the document.andP;  This can result in an inaccurately paginateddocument.andP;  Use Windows, Options, &quot;Show Hidden Text (No)&quot; before invoking theLibrary, Table command.andM;Mouse ShortcutsandM;Microsoft Word does an excellent job of integrating mouse support into thesoftware.andP;  When you use the right mouse button to select Transfer or Print,Microsoft assumes all of the defaults and skips some of the submenus.andO;Transfer moves immediately to the filename to load, and Print willimmediately print the document if you didn't specify any special fonts.andM;Quick ParagraphandM;FormattingandM;All of the paragraph settings in Microsoft Word are stored in the market atthe end of each paragraph.andP;  A quick way to move settings from one paragraphto another is to copy the paragraph marker to the Scrap with Escape Copy.andO;Then move to the next paragraph and use Ins to add the marker.andP;  Theformatting from the first paragraph will be transferred to the second.andM;DESQVIEWandM;Multiple ConfigurationsandM;DESQview uses a special file, DESQVIEW.DVS, to store a script thatautomatically executes whenever you load the program.andP;  For example, you mightwrite a DESQVIEW.DVS script containing the commands required to loadWordPerfect, SideKick, and 1-2-3 each time you start DESQview.andM;But what if you'd like to choose from a number of default programcombinations, depending on the type of work you plan to do during a session?andO;This would require multiple DESQVIEW.DVS files, which DESQview won't permit.andO;You can get around this with a set of batch files to select from multiplestart-up scripts.andM;Say you have three default program combinations.andP;  First, create a differentscript to load each combination and name then DESQVIEW.001, DESQVIEW.002, andDESQVIEW.003.andP;  Then, you could use the following batch file--call itDV1.BAT--to start DESQview and load the programs specified in the firstscript, DESQVIEW.001.andP;  (These examples assume DESQview is located in adirectory called DV.) CD\DV COPY DESQVIEW.001 DESQVIEW.DVS DV DELDESQVIEW.DVSandM;You can create similar batch files to load DESQview with the other startupfiles.andP;  In each case, the batch file copies the appropriate script toDESQVIEW.DVS, opens DESQview--which then loads the programs specified in thatscript--and, finally, deletes DESQVIEW.DVS when you exit the DESQviewenvironment.andP;  The final line in these two batch files allows you to run a&quot;naked&quot; version--that is, one without any automated script--whenever youstart DESQview the standard way.andM;PFS: FIRST CHOICEandM;'Or' SearchesandM;The PFS:First Choice database allows you to narrow a search by specifyingsearch instructions in more than one field.andP;  For example, you can retrieverecords for all persons in the database who are between the ages of 25 and 35and who have a 94000 zip code.andM;But there may be times when you'd like to search for entries whose ages fallbetween 25 and 35 or who have a 94000 zip code.andP;  You can do this by using theprogramming feature and by creating an additional field.andP;  For example, hereyou would add a new field called ORSEARCH and set you field types as follows:FIELD  TYPE AGE:  N (Numeric) ZIPCODE:  (String) ORSEARCH  Y (Yes/No)andM;The forms program would look like this: If AGE andgt; = 25 and AGE andless; = 35 the gotoAddyes If ZIPCODE = &quot;94000&quot; then goto Addyes Goto End :Addyes ORSEARCH = &quot;Y&quot;:EndandM;You can now search for a &quot;Y&quot; in the ORSEARCH field to retrieve the rightentries.andM;PC-FILE PLUSandM;Automatic Time and DateandM;You can use PC-File Plus to automatically store the current time and date ineach record, so that, for example, you can keep a log of business phonecalls.andP;  You might define a database with fields for company name, contactperson, subject, time, date, and notes.andP;  After defining the databasenormally, bring up the Utilities menu and choose item N (Name of field, mask,constant).andP;  Now choose the desired field (date, for example) and then chooseM (for Mask).andP;  An editing window will appear; you can press Ait-H for maskoptions.andM;The date can be entered in a variety of formats.andP;  You can break out themonth, day, and year into separate digit pairs separated by a character (forexample, MM-DD, MM-DD-YY, MM/DD-YY, YY/MM/DD, etc.).andM;Enter a colon, the date mask, and an asterisk; the latter tells PC-File Plusthat this field should be filled in automatically.andP;  Then, if you want to beable to edit the date (for example, if your system's battery dies), add thedigits 09, followed by a terminating colon.andP;  The final string might appearlike this: :YYMMDD*09:andM;You can also create an edit mask that inserts the current time into field::TIME*09:andM;The width of the time field should be 5 (xx:xx); the width of the date fieldwill depend on how many subfields you use and whether you include anyconstants (a / or -, for example).andM;The MM-DD-YY format is easily readable, but if you use the YYMMDD format,you'll be able to sort your records by date; you'll also save two bytes perrecord.andM;CROSSTALKandM;Quick Color ReferenceandM;If you use several online services and have a color monitor, use a differentcolor display combination for each service.andP;  After a few sessions you'llinstantly recognize each service by its color; thus, you'll rarely issue thewrong commands.andM;Color settings can be stored in Crosstalk XVI command files or Crosstalk Mk.4script files.andP;  With both versions of Crosstalk, colors can be set manuallyvia color commands issued on the command line or assigned to function keys.andM;Printing BlocksandM;Crosstalk Mk.4 has a review feature that allows you to move back through acommunications session that has scrolled off the top of the screen.andP;  Blocksof type can be defined and then uploaded via your modem or copied to a diskfile.andP;  But there's no obvious way to print a block of defined text.andM;You can print a block by pretending the printer is a file.andP;  After defining ablock, press the Attention key--Alt-A, unless you've redefined it.andP;  You'll beprompted with the choices Exit, Goto, Find, Write, and Upload.andP;  Choose Write,and when you're asked for a filename, enter PRN, which is DOS's nomenclaturefor the printer port.andP;  After you press Enter, you'll get a message sayingthat the file already exists and asking if you want to append the block tothe old file or erase the file first.andP;  However you answer, the defined blockwill be sent to the printer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
