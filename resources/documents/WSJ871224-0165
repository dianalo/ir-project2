The government said the trade deficit jumped to a seasonally adjusted #1.2 billion ($2.19 billion) last month from #882 million in October and #617 million in September. It was also up from #1.06 billion a year earlier. The current account, which combines merchandise trade with trade in services and certain unilateral transfers, was in deficit by a provisional #595 million, wider than gaps of #282 million in October and #483 million a year earlier and in contrast to a surplus of #17 million in September.    The November current-account figure was much worse than expected by analysts in London's financial district, most of whom had forecast a deficit of between #300 million and #400 million. The latest figure brought the current-account deficit in the first 11 months to a provisional #2.11 billion. At that level, the deficit is in line with the official Treasury forecast of #2.5 billion for 1987. But that forecast generally was regarded as pessimistic when it was published in March, and the deficit was well over twice the #944 million deficit recorded in 1986.    November's widening current-account and trade gaps reflected a jump in merchandise imports of 5.2% from October and 7.2% from a year earlier, to a record #8.15 billion. Exports rose by a slower 1.2% from the prior month and 5% from the year before, to #6.95 billion.    The jump in imports was &quot;across the board, affecting capital, consumer and intermediate goods,&quot; said Ian Harwood, a senior economist at Warburg Securities Ltd. &quot;There wasn't any sign of a dent in demand following the October stock-market crash.&quot;    Several economists said the trade figures show the British economy currently is growing too strongly for its own good. &quot;The British economy must slow down next year,&quot; said Bill Martin, United Kingdom economist at Phillips andamp; Drew. &quot;The message to (Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel) Lawson is to play it cool in the March budget.&quot;    Messrs. Harwood and Martin are among a growing band of economists who believe the British government should think again before proceeding next March with long-cherished plans to cut the basic income-tax rate to 25% from the present 27% in the budget for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1989. They fear that lower taxes could attract a still-higher volume of imports into Britain.    Yesterday's news had only a limited impact on financial markets because of the coming holidays. But analysts said the poor trade figures could exert downward pressure on the pound when foreign-exchange trading accelerates next month. </TEXT></DOC>
