U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani took a pragmatic approach in thecase against Drexel: He got the fifth-largest firm on Wall Street toagree to fork over $650 million in fines and restitution, pleadguilty to six felony counts and cooperate with governmentinvestigators.   Worst of all for Drexel, the settlement could result in the earlydeparture of its most valuable employee, junk-bond wizard MichaelMilken, who now could be indicted and face trial by himself.   But by settling, Giuliani gave up the chance to clear up twomuddy but critical questions about insider trading:   _How many people must know a valuable piece of information beforeit can be considered public knowledge, so that people can trade onit legally?   _How definite must a deal be before public disclosure of insideinformation is required?   Because such questions remain open, the line that separates theillegal from the well-connected is a blurry one.   ``I think it's really too bad that we didn't get a trial on theseissues, both to find whether Drexel really did what it was chargedwith doing and whether those things were illegal,'' said AlanBromberg, a securities law expert who teaches at Southern MethodistUniversity.   Exactly how pragmatic Giuliani was will not be known until thesix counts are made public. There has been some speculation thatGiuliani, in a compromise, agreed not to indict Drexel on someserious insider-trading charges in exchange for getting Drexel toagree to a big fine and to cooperate with the ongoing investigation.   If it turns out that the charges are only for technicalviolations such as ``parking'' stocks in accounts to conceal theirtrue ownership, it would be harder for aggrieved stockholders toride the government's coattails to recover damages.   Also, such limited charges would send the wrong message to otherson Wall Street who are contemplating insider trading: ``Namely, thatif you're clever enough and sufficiently well-defended you can pleadguilty to one of these more technical violations without admittingto serious fraud,'' Bromberg said.   Still, there is no question that the proposed settlementannounced Wednesday was a blow to Drexel, and the $650 million wasnot the worst of it.   In spite of all the assertions that personalities don't matter,Milken means more to Drexel than Michael Jordan does to the ChicagoBulls.   If Milken leaves his X-shaped trading desk in Beverly Hills,Calif., Drexel could lose its pre-eminence in the business ofraising money through the issue of high-yielding, high-risk junkbonds.   Drexel requires that employees take a leave of absence ifindicted. Milken has indicated that if he is indicted, he would quit.   Drexel's junk-bond business will not die but it could slowlywither, particularly if a large part of Milken's staff left with him.   It is sometimes not clear where the loyalties of Drexel's clientslie.   Harold Simmons, a Dallas billionaire takeover specialist who hasused Drexel in three junk-bond financings, predicted Thursday thatMilken will beat any charges against him and stay with Drexel. Buthe has also said that he would follow Milken if he set up his ownfirm.   ``I think Mike Milken is one of the nicest guys I've ever met,''Simmons said.   William Farley, whose Farley Industries is counting on Drexel forhelp in its pursuit of Westpoint-Pepperell Inc., indicated he hasmade contingency plans in case Milken's departure makes itimpossible for Drexel to do its job _ something he said he considershighly unlikely.   Drexel is likely to make out better than E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. Inc.but worse than Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., to name two other firms thathave been caught up in Wall Street scandals this decade.   Hutton was caught in 1985 kiting checks; that is, circulatingmoney between banks so it earned more interest than it deserved. Thescandal hurt Hutton's credibility, especially with banks andmunicipalities; it also made it hyper-sensitive to impropriety,which hampered its dealmaking ability.   Already hobbled, Hutton was crippled by the stock market crash of1987 and driven into the arms of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,which acquired it late last year.   Kidder, in contrast, survived allegations of insider tradingagainst several top officials. It agreed in June 1987 to pay $25million to settle civil charges of insider trading and an improper``stock parking'' scheme with Boesky. It escaped any criminalcharges and has suffered no lasting damage.</TEXT></DOC>
