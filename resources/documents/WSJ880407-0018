Documents recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate that the Continental Airlines unit in particular is staggering under the challenge of combining its money-losing subsidiaries.    As of Dec. 31, Continental's cash and marketable securities had dwindled to $124 million -- less than half its cash position of a year earlier, requiring recent cash advances from Texas Air. And the low year-end cash balance followed a spate of financing late in 1987.    Continental also reaped $125 million late in the year from the sale and leaseback of aircraft, and $7.5 million this year from the sale of its last remaining delivery commitments to acquire more aircraft. Earlier in the year it also sold $521 million in secured and unsecured notes and paid off $235 million of debt. In addition, Texas Air last year advanced Continental $100 million to fund its expanding operations.    And in one of Texas Air's most intriguing internal transactions, Continental received $22 million from Eastern &quot;to provide services in the event of a strike.&quot; Eastern currently is in mediation talks with its machinists' union in an effort to obtain wage concessions. It intends to keep flying if negotiations break down and a strike occurs.    Where did Continental's cash go? According to the documents, the carrier spent as much as $200 million on its overnight mergers with New York Air, People Express, and Frontier in February 1987 to reconfigure its hodge-podge fleet and airport facilities.    Continental paid Texas Air $100 million in cash for its purchase of those airlines and also paid its parent $14.6 million for &quot;management&quot; fees. It spent $825 million on aircraft, spare parts and engines. And Continental's interest and debt expense leaped to $271 million in 1987 -- a 145% jump over the year-earlier figure.    Moreover, the cash position isn't likely to turn around soon. Continental said it expects to &quot;incur a substantial net loss for the first quarter of 1988.&quot; Texas Air has agreed to advance it another $150 million in 1988 -- and $132 million had been advanced by March 15. That infusion, plus &quot;internally generated funds, third-party borrowings and other financings will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements during 1988,&quot; the company said.    Meanwhile, at Eastern, cash reserves fell to $332.9 million at the end of the year from $575.2 million in 1986. &quot;Eastern is seeking to increase its liquidity substantially during 1988,&quot; the company said.    In the first quarter it sold aircraft and gates valued at $52 million, and raised nearly $200 million in a private debt placement to help offset costs in the event of a strike. The carrier also has agreed to sell more aircraft for $19 million, and is considering other sales and sale-leaseback transactions.    In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Texas Air closed yesterday at $12.25 a share, up 25 cents.
