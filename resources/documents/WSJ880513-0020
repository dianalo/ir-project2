Many markets were closed in observance of Ascension Day.    Tokyo share prices plunged before closing firmer. The Nikkei index, which fell 251.20 points Wednesday, closed 51.53 points higher at 27212.58, after falling as low as 26928.82 early in the morning session.    Traders said the Nikkei's fall below the 27000-level for the first time since April 23 prompted investors -- institutional investors in particular -- to hunt for bargains.    Stocks continued their recovery in early Tokyo trading Friday, with the Nikkei index up 239.07 points, to 27,451.65, during the morning session.    The market's ability to rebound from the early declines on Thursday, said one trader, demonstrated that &quot;domestic institutions are still liquid and willing to buy bargains when they can.&quot;    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 5.90 to 2164.43. Volume on the first section was estimated at 900 million shares, down from 1.1 billion shares Wednesday.    Real estate, shipbuilding and auto stocks were among the best performing sectors Thursday, while most financials were lower.    The gains for real estate issues follow advances on land-related speculation earlier this week by many issues outside the real estate sector. Many of those land-related stocks continued to rise also. Heiwa Real Estate was 80 yen higher at 1,740 ($14), while Daiwa House rose 30 to 1,920, and Sumitomo Realty was 30 higher at 1,420.    Railways added to gains posted earlier this week. Keisei Electric Railway rose 17 to 967, while Odakyu Railway was up 40 to 1,060. Both issues have benefited from speculation surrounding their land holdings.    London share prices finished higher as players crept back in to grab some marked-down shares after Wednesday's rout.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 11.2 points at 1417.6. Trading volume was a modest 340.8 million shares, compared with Wednesday's 575.5 million shares. The 100-share index was up 15.5 points at 1772.3.    Traders said the market was attempting to consolidate after the previous day's slump. The positive showing in Tokyo and Wall Street's better opening Thursday also supported London equity prices, dealers said. &quot;People have discounted Wednesday's performance because they realize it was overdone,&quot; one equity salesman said. He noted that a moderate amount of institutional buyers were spotted in the market Thursday.    In addition, the market was heartened by some favorable corporate earnings reports, most notably by composite insurers.    General Accident finished 5 pence better at 915 ($17.25). The company reported that its first-quarter pretax profit rose 245% to a record, matching most market expectations.    Analysts said the favorable results of General Accident boosted share prices in most of the sector. Sun Alliance rose 4 to 914, Guardian Royal finished 10 better at 882, and Commercial Union Assurance ended 6 pence higher at 351.    Rowntree fell 24 to 880 on volume of 1.5 million shares. The closing price was below the effective price of 901.5 being offered by Nestle in a hostile takeover bid. It was the first time Rowntree's shares have fallen below Nestle's offer price since the Swiss company launched its bid last month.    Dealers said Rowntree's decline reflected increased market uneasiness that the bid could be investigated by British regulators.    Stock prices fell broadly in Milan, one of the few European exchanges open Thursday. Carlo De Benedetti's plan to merge the shell of Buitoni S.p.A. with his Cie. Industriale Riunite sent shares of both companies plunging, affecting the rest of the market.    After a delayed settlement, Buitoni fell 6.7%, or 600 lire (48 cents), to 8,410 lire, while CIR dropped 3.3%, or 185 lire, to 5,460 lire. The Milan market index fell 1.9%.    Mr. De Benedetti told Buitoni shareholders Wednesday night that he would probably propose the merger in mid-June. Buitoni's shareholders have approved the sale of its industrial operations to Nestle S.A., and it is now essentially a cash-rich shell company, with assets of 1.3 trillion lire ($1.04 billion).    Brokers traced part of the decline to dissatisfaction with a buy-back price offered Buitoni shareholders.    Share prices closed higher in Manila and Seoul and lower in Sydney, Wellington, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taipei. Wall Street's big drop Wednesday made investors nervous, brokers said.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end. -                                                    % This                                 May 11    May 10    Year    U.S. ...................     232.7     236.5    + 1.4    Britain ................     527.7     538.1    + 2.3    Canada .................     353.4     360.5    + 0.8    Japan ..................    1274.5    1285.0    +24.7    France .................     316.6     320.9    + 9.7    Germany ................     155.7     158.5    - 0.6    Hong Kong ..............    1830.5    1851.5    +11.3    Switzerland ............     143.2     144.7    + 1.8    Australia ..............     275.5     274.9    + 6.3    World index ............     448.6     453.8    +10.0</TEXT></DOC>
