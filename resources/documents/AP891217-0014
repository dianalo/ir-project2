(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four months after a Hollywoodexecutive and his wife were slain in their mansion, the motive isunclear although police say they suspect the shootings were``message'' murders.   Relatives have maintained that Jose Enrique Menendez,hard-driving chairman of Live Entertainment Inc., was killed for areason related to his video and music distribution business.   Nothing was stolen from the Spanish-style, $5 million home.There were no signs the killers forced their way in. No clues wereleft at the scene. The couple were killed the night of Aug. 20 bymultiple shotgun blasts at close range. Their sons said they foundthe bodies after a night out.   Police say they are continuing to investigate possible mob linksto the death of Menendez, 45, and his wife Mary Louise ``Kitty''Menendez, 44. But detectives have pursued many other angles,including questioning the Menendez couple's sons, Erik, 19, andLyle, 21, about the night of the deaths.   The sons did not reply to an interview request relayed byprobate lawyer Stephen B. Goldberg.   Police also are looking into the disappearance of an apparentreference to Menendez's plans to write a new will.   Under terms of the parents' 9-year-old wills, the sons willshare a $10 million estate that Goldberg estimates will exceed $5million after debts and taxes are paid _ ``next summer if all goessmoothly.''   They also were beneficiaries of a $400,000 life insurance policy.   Goldberg said he tried to determine a few weeks ago whether theboys had been ruled out as suspects, but the answer wasinconclusive. ``The only thing I have been able to confirm is thatthere are no prime suspects,'' Goldberg said last week.   Police won't rule out anybody or anything, at least notpublicly. A $25,000 reward posted by family friends had brought insome leads, police said.   ``There has been no specific motive determined,'' said Lt.Robert Curtis, a spokesman for the department. ``It's fair to saysome progress has been made, but that's about all I can say.''   He refused to comment on the disappearance of an apparentreference to a new will in the Menendez home computer.   Family members, speaking on condition of anonymity, said arelative tried to read a computer file named ``will'' after themurders, but was unable to do so. Before a computer expert wasbrought in, the file disappeared.   The relatives would not say who could have erased the file.   No new will has been found. The family and Goldberg say they areconvinced none was made, although Menendez had discussed drawingone up to replace the wills made in 1980 in New Jersey, when he wasfar less wealthy.   Menendez had little money when his parents sent him out of Cubaafter Castro took power. Smart and a perfectionist, he was anexecutive for RCA and Hertz before joining Live Entertainment.   Companies operated by Live had been linked to organized crimeand pornography before Live bought them, but company officials havevehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob link.   Curtis said that was still considered possible, and Menendez'ssister, Marta Menendez-Cano of West Palm Beach, Fla., said not longafter the slayings that the family blamed organized crime.   ``We think he made the mistake of buying a business that hadbeen used before by the Mafia, and we think he was trying to run itstraight,'' she said.   Richard Stavin, former head of a federal task force intoorganized crime's influence in Hollywood, noted that vast amountsof money are at stake in the booming video business, and said,``It's conceivable that this could be a mob hit.''   Meanwhile, the family says the sons have tried to get on withtheir lives. Talented tennis players, they practice obsessivelynowadays and talk of getting into the real estate business. It'sunclear if Lyle will return to Princeton University in January.</TEXT></DOC>
