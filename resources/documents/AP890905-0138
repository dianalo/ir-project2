(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Justice Department saidTuesday it may investigate whether authorities used excessive forceto quell Labor Day weekend riots, but officials defended the actionsof police and National Guard troops.   ``This is the most devastating thing to ever happen to our resortcity,'' Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf said at a news conference. ``Weare eternally thankful that no lives were lost in this tragedy.''   Merchants in this seaside resort spent the day cleaning up fromthe rioting early Sunday and Sunday night, much of it by blackcollege students attending the annual end-of-summer Greekfest.   At least 100 businesses were looted, more than 1,000 people werearrested and 30 police officers or National Guard soldiers wereinjured, authorities said.   Police toting 30-inch-long riot batons and National Guard troopsarmed with unloaded M-16 rifles or .45-caliber pistols and billyclubs cleared city streets of rioters. The 325 Virginia NationalGuardsmen were dispatched at the city's request.   State civil rights leaders have said police overreacted, that thecity and merchants made the students feel unwelcome and that policewould have reacted differently had the crowd been white.   Deborah Burstion-Wade, a Justice Department spokesman inWashington, said it was possible the FBI and the department's CivilRights Division would investigate the riot's handling afterreviewing videotapes. She said the department had received nocomplaints of excessive police force.   Oberndorf, who has called the last accusation ``poppycock,'' saidofficials have received hundreds of calls supporting police.   ``These officers were exposed to an extreme situation,'' saidCity Manager Aubrey V. Watts Jr. ``It's incredible that they wereable to restore law and order without firing a single shot or usingfatal force.''   Maj. Gen. John G. Castles, commander of the Virginia NationalGuard, said he was pleased with his troops' actions. He said theyperformed their duties in a professional manner under difficultcircumstances.   According to preliminary police reports, 1,235 people werecharged with 1,346 offenses between Friday and Monday, mostlydisorderly conduct, drinking violations and traffic offenses.   ``These statistics do not even begin to tell the story,'' saidPolice Chief Charles R. Wall. ``When you're in the middle of a riot,you don't have time to make arrests. Your main concern is to get thestreets secured.''   An estimated 100,000 people jammed Atlantic Avenue, VirginiaBeach's main drag, before the violence began.   Merchants plan to meet this week to discuss how to preventanother riot next Labor Day weekend, said Rick Kowalewitch, owner ofRK's Windsurf Shop.   ``You can't do a whole lot,'' said Kowalewitch, who had anemployee armed with a shotgun guard his store. ``No matter what wedo, we look like a racist.''   Many of the young people who were chased off the streets bypolice were black, but Kowalewitch said he and other whites wereordered off the streets as well.   He said police properly enforced city crowd control ordinancesenacted after last year's Greekfest became unruly.   Greekfest participants who remained at the beach Tuesday weredivided on whether they would return next year.   Brad Williams, 23, of White Plains, N.Y., said he has been comingto Greekfest for five years and will come back. ``I enjoy myself,''he said.   But Tracy Duncan, 26, of Springfield, Mass., said her firstGreekfest will be her last.   ``This was really outrageous,'' she said of the police crackdown.``It's like being in a prison camp.''</TEXT></DOC>
