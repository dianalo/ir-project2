The modem lets your computer send messages over a phoneline. It attaches to the PC and plugs into a phone jack.Modems come in different speeds, measured in &quot;bauds.&quot; A2400-baud modem, a standard speed these days, moves 2400 bitsof data per second. You can find 2400-baud modems for under$100.</LP><TEXT>   A modem will generally come with the basic software youneed to dial into a bulletin board. (A more completecommunications program, costing about $100, could makeconnecting faster and simpler.)   To connect to a bulletin board, call up yourcommunications software and type in the board's phone number.Once you're connected, new members usually have to fill outan on-line questionnaire and pick a password.   Then you generally see a menu of options. In a typicalmenu, you can, among other things, read messages, play gamesand get free software. There is almost always a HELP commandin case you get confused.   There isn't any centralized directory of boards -- theytend to appear and disappear too abruptly for that. The bestplace to find out about boards is Computer Shopper, a widelydistributed monthly published in New York. It carrieslistings of bulletin-boards every other month.   Another good resource is Boardwatch magazine, published inLittleton, Colo. It is one of the few publications devoted tothe bulletin-board culture. It features news, tips, listings,and even interviews with top players in the electronicunderground.
