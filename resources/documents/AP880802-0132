Statements last week by Iran's acting commander-in-chief,Hashemi Rafsanjani, marked the third time since the 1979 seizure ofthe 52 American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran that theissue of Iranian assets frozen by the United States has been linkedto American hostages.   ``If he is talking about military equipment, then thearbitration of Iran's claim against the United States for the valueof spare parts and other equipment ordered before the revolution iscontinuing,'' said an American official at the Iran-U.S. ClaimsTribunal.   The tribunal is adjudicating billions of dollars worth of claimsarising out of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The American officialspoke on condition of anonymity.   Iran has filed a $12 billion claim against the United States forthe miltary equipment and spare parts, the largest claim before thetribunal. Iran seeks delivery of the equipment or payment of itsvalue.   The military materiel was ordered by Shah Mohammad RezaPahlavi's government through the U.S. government's Foreign MilitarySales program.   Transfer of the equipment to Iran, as well as billions ofdollars of Iranian funds on deposit in American banks, was frozenby the U.S. government after the seizure of the embassy hostages.   The Algiers Accords that resulted in freedom for the hostages inJanuary 1981 also unblocked the Iranian assets.   But despite the Algiers Accords, the military equipment, much ofwhich was already paid for, was then impounded by the U.S.government to prevent its use in the Iran-Iraq War.   ``We do have a bunch of their (Iran's) stuff, and there's noquestion that it's their stuff,'' said a tribunal official, whoalso spoke on condition he not be identified.   In August 1980, almost 10 months after the hostage seizure, Iransaid at the United Nations that the United States' release of thefrozen Iranian funds would be a ``symbolic gesture'' that mightspeed the Iranian parliament's debate on the fate of the 52American hostages.   In addition to freedom for the hostages, the 1981 AlgiersAccords effectively worked out guidelines for the arbitration offinancial claims against Iran and the return of money left over.   The American official at the tribunal said that the $9 billionin financial assets frozen by the United States already has beenreturned to Iran or dispersed to its creditors via the AlgiersAccords, which established the tribunal.   The bulk of the money went to repay bank loans to Iran, but$2.915 billion left after repayment was returned to Iran during thecourse of 1981.   In late 1986, Rafsanjani reportedly linked the return ofU.S.-held Iranian assets to possible Iranian intercession forAmericans taken hostage in Lebanon.   The issue came up against the backdrop of negotiations for therelease of $451.4 million in a New York Federal Reserve Bankaccount.   That money was the residue of $3.667 billion deposited at thebank to repay syndicated bank loans owed by Iran.   The reported hostage-assets link was later denied by Iran, andthe $451.4 million was paid to Iran in May 1987.   Much of the impounded military materiel, which reportedlyincludes spare parts for Iran's outgunned air force, is stored invarious private warehouses rented by Iran.   On July 27, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quotedRafsanjani, who is also speaker of the Iranian parliment, as sayingthat ``if (President) Reagan were sincere ... he would release theIranian assets. I have said that once he does so then we will useour leverage in Lebanon and help solve the issue of the hostages.''   The agency said Rafsanjani ``cited the example of the UnitedStates' freezing of and its refusal to deliver the items purchasedand paid for during the shah's rule in Iran.''   On Monday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater disclosed thatthe Iranian government had communicated directly to the U.S.government its insistence that the United States release Iranianassets.   U.S. officials reiterated that they would not enter into anydiscussions with Iranian officials to negotiate the release of thenine Americans held hostage in Lebanon by people sympathetic to therevolutionary government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</TEXT></DOC>
