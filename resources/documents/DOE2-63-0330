<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-63-0330 </DOCNO><TEXT>The technique of Compton scatter imaging, its possible medical applicationsand the fundamental parameters affecting its performance are described.Monte Carlo simulations of a Compton camera for a number of detectorand geometrical configurations indicate a high intrinsic efficiency ({approx_equal}2%) and best values for the point-source response function (PSRF) fullwidth at half-maximum (FWHM) of {approx_equal} 3 mm. The unusual natureof the PSRF and the problems of image reconstruction are briefly discussed.The choice of a suitable position-sensitive semiconductor detector isshown to be most critical - suggestions are made as to the most suitabledetector and a prototype system is described.</TEXT></DOC>
