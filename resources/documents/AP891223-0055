Today, only 20 of the 200 shops that line Christian Quarter Roadremain in Christian hands, says George Atallah, who is GreekOrthodox.   ``The churches of Jerusalem could become museums if people keepleaving,'' Atallah warned.   A worrisome stream of emigration to the West has steadilyincreased, encouraged by a rise in Moslem fundamentalism and thepressures of the two-year Palestinian uprising.   The uprising has caught the Christians in the middle. AsPalestinians, they are part of the anti-Israeli revolt. Theirchildren throw stones and are shot by soldiers. They suffereconomic hardship alongside the Moslems.   But as the rebellion drags on without real gains, Islamicfundamentalism is strengthening and Christian hopes for a secularPalestinian state are fading.   ``Christians wonder what they are going to do here if Islamicforces continue to gain power,'' said Geries Khoury, director of aChristian Palestinian research center near Bethlehem. ``Every daypeople are losing hope.''   The Christian community is particularly outraged at this week'scall by the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement for a generalstrike on Christmas Day, and Christian leaders say it will notblock religious observance of the holiday.   More than 30 Christian denominations have followers in the HolyLand, led by the Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic and Roman Catholicchurches.   Monsignor Michel Sabbah, the first Arab to serve as the RomanCatholic bishop of Jerusalem, believes the diverse Christiancommunity needs special nurturing to prosper.   ``To be a Christian in this Holy Land is a special vocation,''he said in an interview. ``It is a difficult life because of thenature of the land _ always a land of wars, a land of hostility, aland of minorities and majorities.''   The Arab Christians, many descendants of the first followers ofChrist, have been a troubled minority in the Holy Land since theMoslem conquest in the 7th century.   In recent decades the Christians have been further overwhelmedby Jewish immigration and the Moslems' high birthrate.   Israeli experts estimate that in 1947, there were about 650,000Jews, 1.1 million Moslems and 150,000 Christians inBritish-mandatory Palestine.   Since the founding of the Jewish state in 1948, the Jewishpopulation has increased nearly six-fold, and the Moslems have morethan doubled. But the Christian community, numbering just 140,000in Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, is smallerthan it was four decades ago, government statistics show.   Palestinian leaders insist the number is even lower, notingtraditionally Christian towns like Bethlehem and Ramallah now haveMoslem majorities. In Jerusalem, many Christians retain theirproperty but live abroad.   An official of Israel's Ministry of Religious Affairs said thegovernment's policy is to protect and encourage the Christians.   ``The West was always very interested in the fate of theChristians,'' he said. ``Israel wanted good relations with theWest, with the Christian world, so it was in our own interest towatch out for the Christians.''   The official, who insisted on anonymity, blamed the Christians'increasing minority status on a low birthrate and the ``mixedblessing'' of ties to Western churches that anger fundamentalists.   The Palestinian uprising has heightened the Christians' problems.   Many Christians, well-educated in church schools and often fromprosperous merchant families, found the deteriorating economy toomuch to bear, says George Shamas, a Syrian Orthodox writer who hasimmigrated to the United States.   ``Job opportunities are not available,'' Shamas said. ``Life ismore difficult, and people don't want to be stopped by soldiers andsearched and jailed day in and day out.''   Still, many Christians take seriously their longstanding role asleaders of Arab nationalism. The Christian town of Beit Sahour hasbeen an example, carrying out a much publicized tax revolt andboycott of Israeli-made products.   But Joseph, a Beit Sahour Christian who has been jailed severaltimes in the uprising, worries that Moslem Palestinians do notappreciate the Christian contribution.   ``There are efforts by some Islamic groups to exclude us, ormaybe to limit our role in the uprising,'' he said, asking that hislast name not be used.   He added: ``You hear that Christians are going to be equal tothe Moslems if independence comes in the future, but I am sure thatin reality it will not be the case.''   Islamic fundamentalism also is growing among Israeli Arabs, fedby what Moslems feel is discrimination by the Jewish state.Municipal elections last year gave big gains to fundamentalistcandidates.   Christian Arabs in Israel have responded by forming a ``union ofchurches'' in the coastal town of Haifa and the northern Galilee toprotect their position.   Khoury, the Christian researcher, says Christians in theoccupied territories also must ensure their place in a futurePalestinian state. He calls on churches to play an active role inthe uprising, as Moslem mosques do.   ``I am not seeking a Christian solution,'' Khoury insists. ``Iam seeking a Palestinian solution that includes Christians.''</TEXT></DOC>
