The suit, filed in Minneapolis federal court, claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that allows computer users to display &quot;only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field.&quot;    The HyperCard program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every Macintosh sold. It's one of the most popular computer programs of all time, but analysts said the Quickview suit doesn't appear to bode major difficulties for Apple.    The technology at issue &quot;is not an underlying technology of HyperCard to my knowledge,&quot; said Danny Goodman, a San Francisco-area HyperCard program developer.    Nonetheless, the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for Quickview claimed could run into the millions of dollars.    In Cupertino, Calif., Apple said that it believes the case has no merit, and that HyperCard does not infringe &quot;any valid claims&quot; of the Quickview patents. It said it filed an action of its own in federal court in San Jose, Calif., seeking a declaration that Quickview's claims are invalid. </TEXT></DOC>
