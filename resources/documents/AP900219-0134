So why is she so difficult tocapture on stage?   That's one of the themes author Martin Sherman explores in theplay, a intriguing slice-of-life look at Isadora Duncan, the quirkyhigh priestess and great revolutionary of modern dance.   Sherman's play, which opened Monday at off-Broadway'sPlaywrights Horizons, suggests that only those who saw her dancecould begin to understand the woman.   The comedy-drama skillfully blends fact and fiction. It takesplace in Isadora's Paris apartment in 1923, four years before herodd death, when she strangled on a long scarf which caught in arear wheel of her open-air automobile.   Despite the title, the playwright doesn't let Isadora dance onstage. How can you recreate what made her great? Instead, hesuggests what the woman must have been like through her ownoutrageous actions and through the memories of a parade of admirers.   Sherman's Isadora, floundering in her mid 40s, is down but notout, particularly in Elizabeth Ashley's heroic performance, aportrait that revels in all of Isadora's excesses.   At the start of the play, the dancer has been married to thepsychotic Russian poet, Sergei Esenin, for a year and hopes toreturn to Russia where she runs a dance school.   To survive in Paris, she sells off furniture from the apartmentand awaits a visa to Vienna so she can get back to work. She alsohas plans to persuade the Italian government to finance a danceschool in Italy.   The playwright surrounds Isadora with a menagerie of misfits,all of them speaking a different language. They come together in adisastrous, hilarious second-act dinner party where the lack ofcommunication is the least of the problems.   Besides Sergei, Isadora's supper companions include Miss Belzer,a mousy Russian translator hired to communicate with Sergei;Alexandros, a young Greek pianist who worships Isadora; Mary, arich American friend in charge of what is left of Isadora's waningcareer; Luciano, an Italian government official, and Christine, anungainly Swedish girl who is an awkward discipline of Duncan'sdistinctive dance technique.   The play is just as much about these people's remembrances ofIsadora as about the lady herself. Sherman is particularly adept atevoking the joy Isadora's dances brought to people. Throughout theevening, he stops the action so her admirers can soliloquize abouther unique talent.   Especially affecting is Marcia Jean Kurtz as the comic butforlorn Miss Belzer, a refugee from the Russian Revolution. In herperformance, Kurtz distills the worship Isadora evoked.   Marcia Lewis gets every laugh she can from the role of Mary,Isadora's confidante, but Jonathan Walker is not always convincingas Isadora's maniacal younger husband.   Tim Luscombe, a young British director who made his Broadwaydebut earlier in the season with Tom Stoppard's ``Artist Descendinga Staircase,'' handles the shift in action from tragedy tomelodrama to farce with ease.   The autumnal setting, a decaying apartment designed by StevenRubin and filled with fading golds, browns and grays suggests thedisintegration of Isadora's career.   ``I can not explain,'' says the Greek pianist portrayed withtouching enthusiasm by Robert Sean Leonard as he tries to describewhat made Isadora's dancing so extraordinary. Neither can Sherman,but he has built a fascinating play that nevertheless celebratesher elusive art.</TEXT></DOC>
