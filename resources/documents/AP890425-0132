In a harsh editorial, read on the televised nightly news andhourly on the radio, the Communist Party called for a swift end tothe student movement, the biggest since the revolution of 1949.   ``This is a grave political struggle facing the whole party andChinese citizens,'' the editorial said. ``This is a plannedconspiracy that ... aims at negating the leadership of the partyand the socialist system.''   It called the student unions illegal and said new demonstrationswould be suppressed. The unions were set up this week to replacethe state-run student organizations.   ``This is their first step,'' said a Beijing University studentas the editorial was played repeatedly over loudspeakers on campus.``We can expect arrests to come soon.''   Students and student leaders said they would defy the editorial.   ``It makes me sick to hear this,'' said one student at BeijingNormal University, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``This isjust this kind of propaganda and lies we are fighting.'   At least 50,000 students have boycotted class since the strikebegan Monday. They plan to maintain the boycott at least until May4, the 70th anniversary of China's first pro-democracy studentmovement.   They also said they would persist in calling for talks with thegovernment to discuss demands for a free press, more funds foreducation and the publication of the financial records of China'sleaders. Many also want senior leaders such as Premier Li Peng andDeng Xiaoping to resign.   About 10,000 soldiers from a special force for suppressing civicdisturbances took up positions in many buildings near universitycampuses, students and Chinese sources said.   Police and agents from the Ministry of Security also occupiedapartments in the univerity area, the northwest corner of Beijing,sources said.   The government took steps to keep workers from supporting thetwo-day student class boycott, warning them that sympathy strikeswould not be tolerated.   ``I'm all for what the students are demanding,'' said a workerreading a poster on the street outside Beijing University. ``Ireally think the government is no good.''   Another worker, who used his lunch break to hear speeches byuniversity students, said ``many workers are sympathetic to thestudents, but they don't dare take part.''   He said his factory and others were given orders to keep theworkers in line.   Many workers back the student movement because of its criticismof corruption, which runs rampant in China's state-run factories.   The students also have won sympathy among many journalists,whose state-controlled publications have been barred frompublishing news of the class boycott. Only two newspapers havementioned the student marches for democracy.   Authorities banned this week's edition of the Shanghai-basedWorld Economic Herald after it apparently printed material criticalof the government.   Universities throughout Beijing also tried to force the tens ofthousands of striking students back to class. Some schoolsthreatened students with expulsions. Others issued warnings ofunspecified punishment.   The protest is the latest in a series of student actionstriggered by the April 15 death of ousted Communist Party chief HuYaobang. Hu was purged after he was accussed of being too soft onstudents during pro-democracy protests in 1986-87.   On Friday and Saturday, about 150,000 people marched toTiananmen Square in one of the biggest protests since the communistvictory in 1949. The demonstrations are the clearest rejection yetby Chinese students of the communist system.   For the first time Tuesday, bands of students ventured into thecity's center to distribute leaflets calling for democracy, freedomand a free press. They positioned themselves outside the railroadstation and at two busy intersections with collection boxes andmicrophones to persuade their countrymen of the righteousness oftheir cause.   ``Comrades, our struggle is just beginning and we must have yoursupport,'' yelled a bespectacled physics student at the Xidanintersection. ``We are fighting for a new China. Down withcorruption and dictatorship.''</TEXT></DOC>
