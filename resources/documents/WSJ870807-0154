But he still remembers with horror the first time he opened a bank account.    &quot;I felt like I was a defendant in a murder trial,&quot; he says. &quot;It was intimidating.&quot;    To spare others the same difficulties, Mr. Daniels is promoting a new approach: children's banking.    He is a major backer of the new Young Americans Bank, which opened Monday in Denver. By charter, the bank caters to clients &quot;birth through 22,&quot; and its design supports that declaration; some teller counters stand only three feet high, and identification cards for banking transactions are issued to clients too young to own a driver's license.    The infant bank opened to a &quot;swarm of mostly 12-, 13- and 14-year-olds,&quot; who started 125 new accounts ranging from $10 to $1,000, says Linda Sanders, a bank vice president. In fact, she adds, &quot;The coin machine broke down about midday because of the volume of piggy banks brought in.&quot;    Six-year-old Carson Everett brought in her piggy bank to open a $15 savings account. &quot;I think I'll fill the piggy bank (again) and then bring it here,&quot; she declares. Her mother Jana agrees: &quot;I hope that's the case. We seem to get waylaid by the Slurpees at 7-Eleven.&quot;    With an adult to co-sign, kids under 12 can open savings accounts; those 12 and over can have checking at a service charge &quot;affordable to children&quot; -- $2.50 a month. Other banking services include loans, travelers checks and automatic teller machines -- the kinds of things that every child should know how to use.    &quot;It's an effort to teach children how to be financially responsible,&quot; declares Mr. Daniels, who contributed $1.5 million to fund the venture. Several corporations also donated $100,000 each into non-interest bearing checking accounts.    The Colorado Banking Commission declined to charter the bank two years ago because it was unsure that such a bank could sustain itself. But six months ago, after the bank strengthened its capital and made other changes, the commission gave its approval, as did the FDIC. &quot;Opposing this bank would be like opposing Boy Scouts, motherhood and apple pie,&quot; Mr. Daniels says.    Eight-year-old Rachael Miller, who opened a $26.01 savings account, has no qualms. But, she says, &quot;I'm going to keep some money in my desk so that I know I have some to spend.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
