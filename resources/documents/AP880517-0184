(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Employees worked ``fast and furious''Tuesday to clean up a medium-security prison while state agenciesbegan investigating a 59-hour weekend uprising.   Prison officials offered counseling to eight guards takenhostage at the Mack Alford Correctional Center, and prisonspokeswoman Anita Trammell said the disturbance tightened bondsamong the prison's 148 employees.   Gov. Henry Bellmon said he was assigning the investigation tothe Department of Public Safety even though the Oklahoma StateBureau of Investigation had already begun its probe.   ``Our problem with the OSBI's prison investigation is that ittakes them so long,'' said Bellmon.   OSBI spokesman Paul Renfrow said agents expect to interviewabout 100 people involved in the incident, which began Fridayevening and ended Monday morning when the last hostages werereleased unharmed.   State corrections director Gary Maynard said 40 inmatesidentified as being ringleaders or involved in the riot were beingheld in a disciplinary unit called ``The Rock'' at a state prisonin McAlester.   ``All of those will receive misconduct reports. If found guilty(of misconduct), they will most likely receive 30 days in thedisciplinary unit,'' he said.   Maynard said during the 30 days the inmates would receive noprivileges with only one visit a month from family members and onehour a day of exercise during which they will wear handcuffs andleg irons.   ``Their cases also will be submitted to the district attorneyfor review,'' he said.   Prison officials met Tuesday with seven of the eight hostagesand their families at the prison visitor's center, and MarcusPogue, health services administrator at the prison, offeredcounseling to the families.   Most of the prison's 653 prisoners have been transferred toother institutions, and the staff is working ``fast and furious''on a cleanup, Ms. Trammell said.   Ms. Trammell said an early $5 million estimate on damage may below, but added it may be several days before authorities come upwith another estimate.   State corrections officials said about 130 inmates remain atStringtown. They said they did not know when the damaged portionsof the prison would be ready for reoccupation.</TEXT></DOC>
