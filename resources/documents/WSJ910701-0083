Economists said the April figure indicated that theeconomy was pulling out of its yearlong recession.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The recovery has started,&quot; said Michael Gregory, RoyalBank of Canada economist. He predicted that the economy willcontinue to expand in coming months but at a &quot;restrained&quot;pace.   The April rise in GDP, which is the total value of thecountry's output of goods and services, was broadly based.Manufacturing output rose 1.7% in April, its first monthlygain in eight months and its biggest increase since December1986.   Producers of electrical products boosted output 4% inApril, the first gain since last September. Manufacturers ofoffice, store and business machines increased production by4.5% in April, after a 6.5% rise in March.   John McDermid, Canada's finance minister, said the Aprildata were &quot;very encouraging&quot; but said it was too early to saythat the recession is over.   The April pickup was attributed to several factorsincluding a five-percentage-point drop in short-term interestrates in the past year and improving economic conditions inthe U.S., which takes more than three-quarters of Canada'sexports.   The April performance was stronger than expected. Manyanalysts have been predicting that the recovery wouldn't getunder way until the second half of the year.   John Clinkard, senior economist at Canadian Imperial Bankof Commerce, predicted the economy will continue to expandfor the balance of the year.   Several other economists, however, said the pickup won'tbe robust. &quot;The recovery will be uneven and may well facetemporary setbacks,&quot; said Aron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia'svice president of economics.   The continued strength of the Canadian dollar will remaina big drag on the export sector, he said. In Toronto, theCanadian dollar closed Friday at 87.59 U.S. cents, up from87.57 cents Thursday.   Interest rates also remain at comparatively high levels,even after their five-point decline. The prime rate at mostCanadian commercial banks is 9.75%, compared with the U.S.prime rate of 8.5%. The prime rate is a base rate for variouslending charges.   Consumer debt loads, which are near record levels, anddeclining corporate profits also will slow the recovery, saidTed Carmichael, senior economist at Burns Fry Ltd., aToronto-based securities firm.   &quot;Even though the Canadian economy is beginning to recover,it remains vulnerable to political or economic policymistakes in the months ahead,&quot; Mr. Carmichael said.</TEXT></DOC>
