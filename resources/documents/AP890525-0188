All four were found guilty of brutality and will be sentencedJune 15.   Arab hospital officials said Israeli soldiers in the occupiedGaza Strip shot and killed an 18-year-old Palestinian and woundedat least 35 people on Thursday, including a 6-year-old boy. TwoPalestinians were reported wounded in the West Bank.   At least 498 Palestinans have been killed in the uprisingagainst Israeli occupation that began more than 17 months ago.Twenty-two Israelis have been slain.   The military court decided the case of four soldiers accused ofbeating 42-year-old Hani Shami to death Aug. 22 after arresting himduring a roundup at the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza.   Jabaliya is a squalid camp of 60,000 Palestinians just north ofGaza City. The first riots of the uprising occurred there, on Dec.8, 1987, and it is considered one of the Gaza Strip's most militantareas.   Col. Emanuel Gross, the presiding judge, said the soldiers beatShami indiscriminately in his home for about 15 minutes with riflebutts and a broomstick. He said one defendant jumped from a bedonto the victim's stomach.   Medical evidence showed, however, that Shami died of a furtherbeating by other soldiers after he was taken to an army base, thejudge said, adding that the investigation was so poor that thosewho dealt the fatal blows probably could not be identified ordisciplined.   The trial was seen as a test of the army's willingness to punishsoldiers for brutality. The United States has criticized Israel foreither not bringing violators to trial or being too lenient withpenalties.   Beatings became widespread after Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabinauthorized soldiers in January 1988 to beat Palestinian rioters.Commanders said many soldiers initially felt they were required tobreak bones.   Gross said officers in Jabaliya had ordered soldiers to beatPalestinians in detention, in violation of written army orders. Hesaid the orders issued in Jabaliya were ``manifestly illegal'' andthe defendants should have refused to obey.   ``The beating of someone who disturbs order, for the purpose ofdeterrence, is not a military need; it is punishment,'' the judgesaid.   Army spokesmen refused comment on whether charges would be filedagainst officers in Jabaliya who issued illegal orders.   Military officials who testified at the trial acknowledged thatthe orders on beating were ambiguous.   When asked when beatings were permitted, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,the chief of staff, testified in March: ``You are asking me aboutgray areas. ... Soldiers are told to use their own judgment _ howsevere a situation is and how much force is necessary.''   Gross said the army should issue clear written orders on the useof force.   ``We must guard the rule of law, which is the basis for ourvalues as a civilized nation,'' he declared. ``The law must not beharmed, despite the great distress faced by soldiers as theyperform their duties.''.   The defendants _ 1st Sgt. Yitzhak Adler and Yitzhak Kibbudi,Ariyeh Luchato and Pvt. Ron Hakhel, all privates _ could be givenup to three years in prison each for brutality. For manslaughter,the maximum sentence is 20 years.   On Thursday, soldiers in Jabaliya opened fire on stone-throwers,fatally wounding Khaled Mohammed Atawneh, 18, the Arab hospitalofficials said.   Trouble started in the camp when soldiers tried to arrest aPalestinian in his home and rumors spread that soldiers woulddemolish the building.   In other developments Thursday, hundreds of Jewish settlers fromKiryat Arba near Hebron in the West Bank rioted after a firebombattack on an Israeli car. There were no injuries in the attack.   Israel radio said the settlers opened fire indiscriminately, butarmy radio said they were blocked by the army and could not reachHebron, the second largest West Bank city. No casualties werereported.   The army released Ghassan Khattib, a Palestinian universitylecturer detained May 15, a day before he was to meet with visitingU.S. envoy Dennis Ross. His release came following appeals fromPeace Now, an Israeli left-wing movement.   Also Thursday, troops demolished two houses and sealed two otherhouses belonging to four suspected stone-throwers and rioters inthe village of El-Azariya near Jerusalem, the army said.</TEXT></DOC>
