Most of the 15 captives, including nine Americans, are held byfactions believed controlled by Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran'smain Lebanese ally.   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,has tried in vain to keep his party out of the power strugglebetween rival factions in Tehran for supremacy in the post-Khomeiniera.   Hezbollah militants, backed by some 3,000 Iranian RevolutionaryGuards based in the ancient Roman city of Baalbek in easternLebanon, have sided with Iran's hardliners led by Interior MinisterAli Akbar Mohtashemi, according to Shiite sources who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Yet the party's political leadership in Beirut's southern slums,Hezbollah's main power base, is aligned with Tehran's so-calledpragmatists, led by Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, thesources said.   Rafsanjani holds Hezbollah's purse strings.   ``No one can tell how badly this split will reflect on thehostages, but it's going to be bad,'' said one source close toFadlallah.   ``There's going to be no way for quite a while to break thedeadlock shrouding their case,'' said the source.   Much will depend on who emerges as the victor in the Tehranpower play. But that could take months.   The Bush administration ``will have to sit tight and wait forthe dust of the Tehran power struggle to settle before it can makeany move on the hostages,'' the source said.   President Bush said today in Washington he is unsure what willhappen in Iran now that Khomeini has died. But he added, ``There'sa way for Iran's relationship with the United States to improve andthat's for the release of the American hostages'' being held inLebanon.   There has been no word on the hostages since the latest round offighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war broke out March 8.   Hezbollah and the rival pro-Syrian Amal militia has stayed outof the battles, which pit Syrian against Christian forces. Many inBeirut believe the Shiites' role on the sidelines has minimized therisk that the hostages would be hit in shelling that has killed 360people and wounded more than 1,400.   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York made a three-day visit toLebanon two weeks ago to refocus attention on the hostages.However, he left empty-handed after his repeated appeals to see theAmerican captives drew no reponse.   A week before Khomeini's death, Beirut's Ash-Shiraa magazinesaid the ``file of the hostages held in Lebanon is now in the handsof Ahmad Khomeini,'' the ayatollah's son.   Ash-Shiraa, which broke the story of the secret U.S.arms-for-hostages deal that came to be known as the Iran-Contraaffair, also said Ahmad Khomeini recently summoned severalHezbollah officials to discuss the hostages.   The magazine said Khomeini's son is allied with Mohtashemi. Itsuggested Iran's hardliners have taken charge of the hostage issue.   Hezbollah publicly contends it has not been involved in thewaves of kidnapping that have swept Lebanon since Khomeini's brandof fundamentalism swept Lebanon in 1983.   But there is little doubt among Western and Lebaneseintelligence sources that all four factions holding most of theAmerican hostages operate under Hezbollah's wing and are controlledby the party's militants.   Among them is Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, which claimedthe abduction of American journalist Terry Anderson, thelongest-held hostage, and U.S. educator Thomas Sutherland.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Sutherland was grabbed June 9of that year.   Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite is also believed to be held byIslamic Jihad, although no claim has been made. He disappearedafter leaving a west Beirut hotel Jan. 20, 1987 for a meeting totry to win the Americans' release.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   The writer, the AP's Beirut correspondent, hascovered the hostage story since it began.</TEXT></DOC>
