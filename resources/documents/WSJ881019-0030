The success of Shamrock's $42-a-share tender offer for Polaroid could depend on the outcome of the court fight. The tender offer, valued at about $2.4 billion, is scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. EDT on Oct. 27.    Scheduled to testify at the court proceedings are Stanley P. Gold, president of Shamrock, and several top Polaroid officials, including Chief Executive Officer I. MacAllister Booth and William J. McCune Jr., chairman of the Cambridge, Mass., photographic concern.    Although Shamrock would still be able to pursue another tender offer if it loses the court fight, its chances of success would be diminished. About 14% of Polaroid's shares are in employee hands as a result of the ESOP which was created last July. Corporate law in Delaware, where Polaroid is chartered, bans the consummation of a merger for three years unless a buyer acquires 85% of a target's stock.    Shamrock, of Burbank, Calif., is an investment vehicle for the Roy E. Disney family. </TEXT></DOC>
