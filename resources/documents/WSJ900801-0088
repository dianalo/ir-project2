They work out of a trailer.They have power lunches at Eat n' Park. Their machinespredate World War II. They type their own letters, and theyclean up after themselves.   Their company? Alcoa -- the world's largest aluminumproducer. Aluminum Co. of America hopes that by freeing theseworkers from the shackles of bureaucracy (and the lap ofluxury), and by letting them work in their own small unit, itwill tap the entrepreneurial spirit.</LP><TEXT>   The unit's task: to create a market for Arall, a recentlydeveloped sheet metal. Arall combines aluminum and fiber tocreate a material that is 30% stronger than aluminum and 35%lighter. Trouble is, it's also three to four times moreexpensive. The material holds great promise for the aerospaceindustry, Alcoa believes, but profits may not come for 10years, if at all.   Alcoa's experiment is bucking the odds. Largecorporations' attempts to foster &quot;intrapreneurship&quot; --capturing the zeal of small business owners within largeorganizations -- have often failed miserably.   Alcoa's only other effort, in the lighting business,nearly drowned in red ink. It started to show profits onlyafter Alcoa bailed it out with more money and tightenedcontrols. Studies suggest that such ventures fail most oftenbecause they lack autonomy and separate facilities or getotherwise tangled in the bureaucracy of their corporateparents.   The trick is getting managers to &quot;operate more on gutfeelings and natural abilities than thinking about whatsomeone's going to say,&quot; says Cindy Iannarelli, trainingcoordinator at the University of Pittsburgh's Small BusinessDevelopment Center.   Alcoa thinks its Arall Laminates unit fits the bill. Arallemployees have their own facility and set their own hours,typically working on weekends and until 8 p.m. in theevening. And Alcoa is content to leave them alone -- as longas they keep the red ink at a trickle.   The aluminum maker owns the exclusive internationallicense to produce the material, protecting the intrapreneursfrom most competition. And the technology is brand new,giving the Arall makers a more authentic start-up feeling.   Sandy Nelson, vice president of Alcoa and general managerof its steel and plate division, thinks the intrapreneurialformat is right for the product. He says Alcoa's largerdivisions would have been too preoccupied to nurse the infantArall. &quot;The interference of other products would diminish theemphasis on Arall,&quot; he says. But that's not a problem forArall's current makers. &quot;They're a highly energetic team witha very narrow focus,&quot; he says. &quot;That's a powerfulcombination.&quot;   Mr. Nelson also thinks Arall's fatigue resistance -- a hotitem in the aerospace industry -- will help the unit succeedwhere others have failed. &quot;There's a great marketopportunity,&quot; he says.   Dutch Prof. Bood Vogelesang invented the material in thelate 1970s for Akzo, the Dutch chemical concern. Akzo soldAlcoa production rights to the material in 1985. (Akzo hassince had second thoughts, and is now discussing a jointventure with Alcoa.)   Alcoa let the material sit in its New Kensington researchlab for three years. It wasn't eager to plunge intoproduction of a material that didn't yet have a market.   The company would have had to spend about $100 million tobring the new product to market, with no guarantee that itwould succeed. &quot;You have a long, long incubation time,&quot; saysAlcoa's Mr. Nelson. It looked as if Arall might die on thedrawing board.   Meanwhile, William Evancho, former head of Alcoa'ssteamship division, was bored with his job in the NewKensington lab. He persuaded Mr. Nelson that he could turnArall into a business without spending too much money. Alcoagave him a little cash and a lot of latitude.   In January 1988, he took a 29-year-old engineer, MichaelGregory, as his marketing director and went to find a marketfor Arall. Mr. Evancho thinks he can turn Arall into a $100million-a-year business. But even if he fails, Alcoa won'thave wasted much more than the $20 million it has invested sofar.   The 43-year-old Mr. Evancho isn't a traditionalentrepreneur: His money isn't on the line. But his careercould be. If the project takes off, he will climb severalnotches on Alcoa's corporate ladder. If it fails? &quot;I don'thave a job,&quot; says Mr. Evancho. &quot;And I have eight kids.&quot; Mr.Evancho says he'd like his pay to eventually be based onArall's performance -- though he'd rather wait until theproduct starts showing a profit.   Messrs. Evancho and Gregory say they run the business asif it were their own. At their trailer offices, neckties areoptional. When employees take a cup of coffee, they are askedto contribute coins to a coffee fund. They put in long hoursat the factory, which looks like a sparse, open hangar. Themachinery itself looks as if it came from a rummage sale:State-of-the-art control panels operate 1940 heavy machinery.   The two savor their freedom from the Alcoa bureaucracy.&quot;We're the Oakland Raiders of Alcoa,&quot; says Mr. Gregory. AddsMr. Evancho: &quot;Sometimes we're the Bad News Bears.&quot; They wearnicknames on their hardhats. The workers call Mr. Gregory&quot;Papa Dog,&quot; so named after he told recruits they would bereferred to as &quot;Arall dogs.&quot;   Without club memberships, they spend their weekends insearch of buyers and their early morning hours on the phonewith European aerospace companies. They visit auctions topick up equipment.   &quot;It's kind of like we're newlyweds,&quot; says Mr. Evancho.&quot;You get what you can afford.&quot;   They're enjoying a protracted honeymoon. &quot;The guys in theArall program are more aggressive than the run-of-the-millmetallurgists at Alcoa,&quot; says Richard Pettit, a purchasingagent at McDonnell Douglas, which agreed to use Arall in thecargo door of its C-17. &quot;They got their material {used} on anairplane much faster than usual.&quot;   Arall says it expects to take in $1 million in revenuethis year, half of which comes from the C-17 contract and therest from retrofitting old planes. Arall executives expecttheir cash flow to even out this year, and they predictprofits by 1993. But the business relies on the slow-changingand unpredictable aerospace industry, and Arall had to scaleback earlier profit projections after Fokker, a Dutchaerospace concern, shelved its F-100, which would have usedArall.   Still, rivals seem worried. &quot;When it was part of bigAlcoa, I didn't consider it competition,&quot; says MarcVerbrugen, marketing director for Akzo's rival product,Glare. Now, he says, he does.</TEXT></DOC>
