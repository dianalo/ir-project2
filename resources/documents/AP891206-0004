In a region so far immune to dramatic improvements in relationslike those occurring in Europe, Japan has at best cool relationswith the Soviet Union as the two countries are deadlocked over anold territorial dispute. And the United States is pressing Tokyo toincrease its budgetary support for U.S. forces based in Japan.   Japan's military budget, always controversial in light of aconstitution that bans war, has grown steadily through the 1980s toincrease the country's ability to fend off Soviet attack.   ``It is separate from (superpower) arms reductions from thatpoint of view. So our own efforts for improving our self-defenseare not expected to change at the moment,'' Foreign Ministryspokesman Taizo Watanabe told a news conference Tuesday.   He was asked if the outcome of the superpower summit in Malta,which gave new impetus to arms negotiations between the UnitedStates and Soviet Union, would reduce Japan's military spending.The United States is starting to plan for defense cuts, and U.S.Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says the Soviets have reducedmilitary spending.   Japanese newspapers reported today that Seiki Nishihiro, viceminister of the Defense Agency, had cautioned the public againstthinking that the superpower summit could result in a cutback inthis country's defense budget.   And an anonymous Foreign Ministry official was quoted in theYomiuri Shimbun daily as saying, ``The Asian situation iscompletely different from that of Europe, and still remainsunstable. Japan needs to develop a minimum defense strength fordeterrence.''   Last week, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that the defensebudget would grow a hefty 6 percent in the fiscal year that beginsin April, to about $27.8 billion, or roughly 1 percent of grossnational product.   The U.S. defense budget is more than 10 times as large andconsumes 6 percent of gross national product.   Japan's defense spending has grown rapidly in dollar terms dueto the yen's almost doubling in value since 1985, and now is judgedthird-biggest in the world or slightly ahead of Britain, France andWest Germany.   Much of the defense buildup took place in close coordinationwith the United States, which by treaty is obliged to help defendJapan. The two countries' navies and air forces collaborate ondefense planning, and the Japanese have been building up potent airand anti-submarine forces.   Unlike Central Europe, with its fairly clear divide between twosuperpower camps on the ground, the Far East is a vast area inwhich control of the sea is a more important factor, and there aremore contenders: the Soviets, China, the U.S.-Japan alliance, andpowerful smaller countries like Vietnam and the Koreas.   The Asian countries, however, have bitter memories of Japaneseinvasions, and have protested Tokyo's increases in militaryspending.   After World War II, U.S. occupation authorities imposed aconstutition that bans the use of military force, and the armedforces have an ambiguous status. Their existence is justified asstrictly for self-defense, and Japan has not acquired hardware thatwould enable distant military adventures, such as long-rangebombers or aircraft carriers.   But some Americans have called for Japan to increase defenseefforts even more to relieve the U.S. military outlay.   President Bush recently signed a bill calling on Japan to payall the costs of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan.Japan now pays about 45 percent of the support, or about $2.8billion a year.   The Japanese government has not yet commented on the new callfrom Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
