A small group of radical students demanding a ban on foodimports hurled several firebombs and rocks at the main gate of theU.S. Air base in Kunsan, about 130 miles south of Seoul, policesaid.   Five students were arrested by South Korean police. U.S.officials reported minor damage to a guardhouse, but no injuries.   About 2,000 students and farmers hurling firebombs and rocksbattled riot police at Konkuk University in eastern Seoul afterthey were prevented from marching into the street to call for theoverthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's government.   Hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and black,visored helmets made repeated charges to drive the protesters backas armored police vans fired barrages of tear gas bombs.   ``Drive out the Yankees who enforce the opening of agriculturalmarkets,'' protesters chanted.   Police officials said more than 300 farmers and students werearrested in Seoul for taking part in anti-government protests. Thepolice said they had no information on injuries.   Protesters gathered at Konkuk after the government deployed some7,000 riot police to block a farmers' protest on Yoido Plaza nearthe city center. Police banned the rally as a threat to law andorder.   Farmers' groups called the rally to demand an end to U.S.imports and also seek an increase in prices for domestic farmproducts. The groups claim cheap U.S. imports threaten to driveSouth Korean farmers out of business.   Police blocked the rally after Prime Minister Kang Young-hoonordered security forces Tuesday to launch a crackdown to blockanti-government rallies by students, workers and farmers.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said farmers' groups heldprotests in other parts of the country, occupying government andpolitical party offices.   The agency said farmers fought police in at least a score ofcities and towns, but gave no details.   About 100 farmers occupied an opposition party office in Najunear the southern city Kwangju after police stopped them fromleaving for Seoul, Yonhap said. Farmers also occupied a governmentheadquarters in Haenam.   Police checkpoints blocked farmers from entering Seoul to takepart in the rally.   The United States is pressing for greater access to South Koreanmarkets to help correct Seoul's $8 billion trade surplus withWashington. The South Korean government is reluctant to openagricultural markets because of domestic political opposition.   Radical students are supporting the farmers to try and expandanti-government forces. But the students have little support andare not seen as a serious threat to the government.</TEXT></DOC>
