Hahn and other management members a strong vote of support at yesterday's annual meeting, despite the West German auto maker's controversial foreign-exchange loss of as much as 473 million marks ($259 million).    Predictably, Volkswagen management repeated its defense that it had been victimized by falsified currency contracts stemming from a criminal conspiracy that it couldn't control. During his opening address to a packed assembly hall in Wolfsburg, West Germany, Mr. Hahn called the foreign-exchange loss &quot;a depressing experience.&quot;    &quot;It came precisely at a time when our company had reached a certain peak in terms of market success,' Mr. Hahn said. &quot;The loss of such large sums is without question a setback for us. The severity is surpassed only by that of the damage to our reputation.&quot;    Mr. Hahn drew applause when he promised shareholders that Volkswagen will withdraw from the highly speculative arbitrage trading activities that led to the loss and will restrict its foreign-exchange operations to those that provide currency for its auto production. That would substantially curtail the company's currency dealings.    The chairman maintained that speculating through currency arbitrage is a legitimate activity under Volkswagen's bylaws. But the company's most important shareholders, including Deutsche Bank AG, made clear that they expect a return to more conventional foreign-exchange practices.    The meeting was marked by shouting, hissing and sporadic applause from the audience. In the confidence vote, Mr. Hahn and the other current members of the management board received 98.2% of the about 12.3 million shares voted by 2,933 holders. The number of shares represented about 52% of the voting stock outstanding.    Volkswagen drew no criticism at the meeting from its major shareholders, the Bonn government and the state government of Lower Saxony.    Also at the meeting, Volkswagen announced that group net income edged up 1.8% in the first half, to almost 290 million marks from 285 million marks a year earlier. Group sales gained 2.3%, to 27 billion marks from 26.4 billion marks.    The sales gain came despite a 1.4% decline in deliveries of vehicles made by Volkswagen and its Audi and Spanish subsidiaries, to 1.4 million units.    But Mr. Hahn held out little hope for substantial increases in sales or profit in all of 1987. &quot;We will have to bid farewell to the high growth rates experienced in recent years and expect less rapid development,&quot; he said.    Unlike most West German annual meetings, yesterday's gathering drew broad attention because of the currency scandal and the prospect that Mr. Hahn, presiding at his sixth Volkswagen annual meeting just one day after his 61st birthday, might face a barrage of criticism.    At least 95 journalists signed up for the long trek to isolated Wolfsburg, probably a record for any German annual meeting. Their number was three times last year's.    During the meeting, the auto maker's supervisory board chairman, Karl Gustaf Ratjen, held out the possibility that a legal battle with National Bank of Hungary might result in Volkswagen's recovering some of the money lost through the currency scandal.    The scandal came to light in February when Volkswagen's banking partners, including National Bank, refused to honor forward foreign-exchange contracts, alleging they were forged. The bank has denied any knowledge of currency contracts extended in its name by a Frankfurt foreign-exchange trader, who has since vanished.    Management took full advantage yesterday of a Volkswagen-commissioned report by an independent auditor that, as previously reported, exonerated senior management from responsibility for the currency loss. Instead, the report heaped most of the blame on Volkswagen's former chief financial officer, Rolf Selowsky, who retired in March.    That refrain was taken up yesterday by major shareholders and major proxy representatives, as well as Volkswagen's supervisory board. Mr. Selowsky received a vote of no confidence from 95.5% of the shares voted.    &quot;One has the impression that a scapegoat was sought, and found,&quot; said Hans Peter Schreib, representing small shareholders.    In one of the meeting's more rancorous moments, another such representative, Willy Weber, asked why management denied any knowledge of a currency loss last October, when rumors of one first appeared. &quot;I'm suspicious,&quot; he declared. &quot;It occurs to me that there is a lot of bright sunshine here despite a number of problems.&quot;    In the wake of Volkswagen's narrow 1% profit margin last year, Mr. Hahn detailed a series of restructuring plans for loss-making subsidiaries. He took note of his record at the company over the past five years, during which Volkswagen returned to profitability following a period of deep losses. Looking ahead, Mr. Hahn asserted that &quot;there is unlikely to be any further impairment of the company's operating result&quot; resulting from the currency scandal. </TEXT></DOC>
