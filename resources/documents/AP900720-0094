Five days after the earthquake, measuring 7.7 on the Richterscale, officials said reports of damage and deaths were stilltrickling in from remote areas. By latest counts, 674 people werekilled and more than 2,600 injured.   Mrs. Aquino ordered several aides to take over reliefoperations, apparently bypassing the disaster-coordinating agencyled by Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos.   The president, already beset by Communist rebels, rebelliousmilitary officers and popular discontent, has come under criticismfor a government rescue effort described by many as inadequate.   The rescuers, for their part, battled poor communications,fatigue, supply shortages and and equipment problems.   On Friday, a U.S. Marine OV-1 observation plane taking part inrescue operations crashed near Baguio, killing one of the twocrewmen. The victim's name was not released pending notification ofkin, and the cause of the crash was under investigation.   Also Friday, a helicopter carrying Ramos on an inspection tourmade an emergency landing after a cockpit warning light came on.Ramos transferred to another aircraft and continued his tour.   Both incidents were near the mountain resort of Baguio, 130miles north of Manila.   Rescuers in Baguio dug through the night after finding freshblood in a tunnel they had dug under the rubble of the Hyatt Hotel_ indicating there could be victims alive in the debris.   But they found only the bodies of a man and a woman. As many as50 people were believed to have been caught in the hotel when thequake struck.   Members of a British rescue team said it was unlikely there wereany survivors in the rubble of seven other Baguio hotels thatcollapsed during the quake.   At least 224 people, including two Americans, were killed inBaguio during the quake. In addition, more than 120 were feareddead in eight factories of the Baguio Export Processing Zone, whichcaught fire during the quake.   Power was restored to parts of Baguio, and banks resumedoperations. But more aftershocks rocked the city, terrifying thecity's 120,000 people. Many refused to sleep indoors.   More than 100 people were believed stranded on highways nearBaguio, and Marines and Philippine troops mounted rescue operations.   Officials said more than 900 people also were feared stranded ina mountain pass along the border of Nueva Vizcaya and Nueva Ecijaprovinces.   Rebels who tried to topple Mrs. Aquino in December offered atruce to help with the relief effort.   The underground Revolutionary Alliance of the Masses-Soldiers ofthe Filipino People said in a statement that ``during this time ofnational tragedy'' the rebels would suspend anti-governmentactivity.   Many leaders of the rebel movement are graduates of thePhilippine Military Academy, located in hard-hit Baguio.   Heavy casualties were also concentrated in Cabanatuan, 60 milesnorth of Manila, where more than 60 students and teachers werekilled at the Philippine Christian College.   One girl who was injured at the college told ABS-CBN televisionthat her class was in the middle of a lesson on earthquakes whenthe quake struck and the classroom collapsed.</TEXT></DOC>
