Araskog, ITT Corp. chiefexecutive officer, vigorously defended his 1990 pay asshareholders repeatedly questioned whether his performancejustified his compensation, which totaled $11.4 millionincluding stock options in which he won't become vested until1993.   The meeting provided shareholders with their firstopportunity to confront Mr. Araskog face-to-face over anissue that has dogged the executive and the company formonths. The $60 billion California Public EmployeesRetirement System, known as Calpers, first criticized Mr.Araskog's pay late last year because of the perceiveddisparity between his compensation and ITT's performance.Last week, Calpers announced that it voted its 1,149,150shares, about 1% of ITT's shares outstanding, against there-election of directors in protest.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Araskog at first demurred in response to shareholderquestions about his pay, which more than doubled in 1990.Calpers, which has gained a reputation as an activistinvestor, wasn't represented at the meeting. But individualshareholders bluntly rebuked Mr. Araskog. &quot;It's wrong] It'sunjustified,&quot; exclaimed one man.   Mr. Araskog at first said he didn't set his owncompensation, in responding to a woman who asked for threevalid reasons why he deserved to have his 1990 compensationmore than double when profit rose only 4%. But withshareholders persisting, the executive said critics of heftyexecutive compensation are singling out chief executives butnot richly paid athletes and entertainers. Recounting his25-year ITT career, Mr. Araskog said he received few stockoptions on the way up, and that his 1990 pay reflected notonly salary and bonus but also long-term incentive payoutstied to the company's performance over the past three years.   &quot;Budgets for those years were exceeded,&quot; he said. As aresult, &quot;1990 happened to be a spectacular year. I feel Iearned it.&quot;   In 1991, he pointed out, his pay will be less than the1990 figure because the portion tied to long-term incentiveswon't be as large. Still, Mr. Araskog conceded at the end ofthe meeting that &quot;if I were sitting out there, I might sharesome of that view&quot; about the high pay levels. Mr. Araskogalso said that directors might review executive compensationif they conclude the shareholder protests are justified.   Joseph Taft, another shareholder, said, &quot;I'm a bitinsulted. . . . I don't think it takes a genius to sell offassets&quot; to boost earnings. Addressing ITT lawyers, Mr. Taftthen asked if it were possible for shareholders to vote ongranting Mr. Araskog an estimated $4.2 million in restrictedstock in which he would become vested in 1993. &quot;That's notpossible,&quot; Mr. Araskog answered. &quot;That's already ownedstock.&quot;   After the meeting, Mr. Araskog blamed the media for muchof the attention on the executive pay issue. That view wasechoed by Robert A. Burnett, the newly appointed chairman ofITT's compensation committee and chairman of Meredith Corp.,a diversified media company. Mr. Burnett said Mr. Araskog's1990 pay also reflected Mr. Araskog's role in ITT's sale ofinterests in Alcatel N.V. and Alcatel Alsthom for a one-timecombined after-tax gain of $186 million. &quot;He did anoutstanding job in a very important area,&quot; Mr. Burnett said.But Mr. Burnett added that it is &quot;entirely possible somechanges will be made&quot; in how Mr. Araskog's compensation iscalculated.   In other comments, Mr. Araskog reiterated that ITT expects1991 operating profit to exceed 1990's, when the company hadprofit of $1.11 billion before taxes. Net for 1990 was $958million, or $7.28 a share. Mr. Araskog also said he expectsITT Sheraton to be profitable this year despite tough marketconditions. In 1990, Sheraton posted operating profit of $39million, down from 1989's $117 million.   ITT has interests in, among other things, insurance,hotels, financial services and forest products.</TEXT></DOC>
