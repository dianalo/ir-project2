Only a few industries are facing less competition because of the currency's depreciation, and even among the lucky few, fewer still are gaining substantially against their foreign competitors. Most American producers actually will face tougher international competition this year than during the previous two years. This means, of course, that the overall trade deficit will improve very little.    The reason for this uneven pattern of benefits is that the dollar has fallen against only a handful of currencies, namely the yen and the major European currencies. This decline has been the focus of attention of both the administration and many economists, who conclude that the trade deficit will narrow and U.S. industrial production will increase in 1987 as a result.    Indeed, U.S. producers whose primary rivals are Japanese or European will face less stiff competition. But the major competition for many American industries comes not from Japan or Europe but from countries such as Canada, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea, whose currencies either have been stable or have fallen against the dollar in the past 24 months. Since how much a particular industry benefits from the dollar's depreciation depends critically upon the pattern of foreign competition for that industry, the dollar's plunge against a few key currencies is not and cannot be a broad program of relief from foreign competition. Rather, it is a highly specific and narrow subsidy that will provide only limited help to a few producers.    During the past two years the dollar has declined about 45% against the yen, the Swiss franc and the German mark, about 35% against the other European currencies, and 30% against the pound. Treasury Secretary James Baker seems to believe that the dollar must continue to fall against these currencies until American manufacturing regains the upper hand.    Yet over this same two-year period, the dollar held steady against the Canadian dollar, the Korean won and the Hong Kong and Singapore dollars, and rose 370% against the Mexican peso, 300% against the the Brazilian cruzado, 100% against the Venezuelan bolivar, and 15% against the Australian dollar. Since many American industrial and agricultural products compete more with goods from this latter group of countries than with those from Europe and Japan, a further rise of the yen and the mark will do absolutely nothing to help them.    Economists have focused lately on the various trade-weighted measures of the dollar's value. The Federal Reserve Board, for one, calculates the average value of the dollar compared with the currencies of America's 10 major trading partners, each weighted according to its proportionate share in total U.S. trade. On this basis, the dollar has declined 39% since its peak in early 1985. The Dallas Federal Reserve Bank has developed a more representative index for the dollar, which includes 131 of the countries with which the U.S. trades. On this basis, the dollar is only 5% weaker than it was at its peak in early 1985.    Neither of these indexes, however, provides any information on which sectors are benefiting or by how much. Such information can be had only by constructing a separate index for each specific product category. In each product index, the movements of the dollar against all the various currencies must be weighted by the actual proportions that each foreign country represents in trade with the U.S. This can be done for any product for which country-by-country trade data are available.    For example, in the category &quot;food and live animals,&quot; Canada accounts for 10% of U.S. trade, while Japan accounts for 11%, Brazil 6.8%, Mexico 6.3%, etc. Using these proportions to weight the changes in the dollar against the changes in these countries' currencies produces a food-dollar index, which is up 35% over the past two years. In the category &quot;manufactured goods,&quot; Canada received a weight of 23%, Japan 14.8%, Germany 5.1%, Taiwan 4.5%, and so on. The manufactured goods-dollar index as a whole is up 9.4%.    As the nearby tables show, very few U.S. industries are more competitive today than they were two years ago. In fact, none of the seven broadest trade categories, which together account for 95% of U.S. trade, is more competitive today -- at least not thanks to currency fluctuation.    The American agricultural sector, for example, is 35% worse off now than in early 1985. This is because more than 30% of its competition comes from countries with weak currencies such as Canada, Australia, Mexico and Brazil. Even in the manufactured-goods sector, U.S. producers overall are not better off; the dollar is nearly 10% stronger against the relevant trade-weighted group of currencies. In the case of manufactured goods, Canada is a larger competitor than Japan; and Korea, Mexico and Taiwan each account for as much U.S. trade as does Germany.    Another striking feature of the product-dollar indexes is the tremendous variation in the amount by which various goods are influenced by currency changes. In the broad product categories, machinery and transport equipment and miscellaneous manufactured goods show the least loss in competitiveness due to currency fluctuations over the past two years. Their indexes rose only 4.5% and 4.7%, respectively. The hardest hit of the broad sectoral categories are food, where the dollar is 35% stronger, and petroleum and related products, where the dollar is 60% stronger.    Even more striking variations can be seen in some of the major sub-categories of the eight broad product groups. Within the broad category of food, for example, the &quot;wheat-dollar&quot; is 22.7% stronger than two years ago, while the &quot;animal feed-dollar&quot; is 17.7% weaker. This means that U.S. wheat farmers face more competition than they did two years ago, while animal-feed producers should have a somewhat easier time of it. In the manufacturing sector, suppliers of iron and steel products are better off by 13.3%, paper producers are ahead by 0.2%, and producers of goods made with precious minerals and pearls have seen the dollar fall by 16% against their competitors. In contrast, makers of semi-manufactured goods face a 19% stronger dollar.    These results point out the very limited and uneven influence the dollar's decline is having on various U.S. industries. Because the producers face competition from a great variety of countries, the dollar would have to decline equally against as many as 131 currencies for all American industries to be aided equally. This would still be no guarantee of a trade balance, since there is no way to know how foreign producers would change their prices in response.    If the U.S. is to return to a trade equilibrium, it cannot do so by having a trade balance with all of our trading partners or in all product categories. Nor can the trade balance be restored by changes in a few currency values. Rather, as these product-by-product indexes point out, each industry must seek its own resolution based upon the nature and origin of its specific competition. A trade balance will be restored only when enough U.S. industries regain international competitiveness through increased productivity and greater efficiency and run a trade surplus sufficient to offset the deficits in remaining sectors.    ---   Ms. Olivier is president of Claremont Economics Institute in Claremont, Calif.    ---          THE CHANGING DOLLAR'S IMPACT ON INDUSTRY                        BIG WINNERS                                                % Change in                                    Share of    the Dollar's                                   Total U.S.   Value Since                                   Trade (%)     Feb. 1985* INDUSTRY Pharmaceutical Products              0.5          - 23.7 Passenger Motor Vehicles             8.0          - 22.9 Animal Feed                          0.3          - 17.7 Products Made of Precious   Minerals and Pearls                0.7          - 16.0 Plates andamp; Sheets, Iron or Steel       0.8          - 13.3 Cotton                               0.3          - 11.3 Iron Pipes, Tubes andamp; Fittings         0.5          - 10.2 Aircraft andamp; Spacecraft                2.8          -  4.6                         BIG LOSERS Parts for Road Vehicles andamp; Tractors   1.9          + 51.7 Petroleum Products                   3.6          + 37.8 Footwear (Excluding Military)        1.1          + 34.1 Synthetic Resins; Rubber andamp; Plastic   0.8          + 27.5 Gas -- Natural andamp; Manufactured        0.8          + 25.3 Wheat -- Unmilled                    0.6          + 22.7 Miscellaneous Manufactures andamp;   Semimanufactures                   0.5          + 19.1   *(+) indicates a stronger dollar, (-) a weaker dollar.
