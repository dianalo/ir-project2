The new products represent a shift in strategy for thecompany, which is trying to reshape its own image after astring of quarterly losses and a host of litigation. As partof that shift, Recognition Equipment is divesting itself ofsome operations to focus its attention on image processing,systems that enable companies to automate the handling ofpaperwork.</LP><TEXT>   The products to be introduced fall into three categories.One category will enable users to create and modify their ownimage processing systems without requiring sophisticatedprogramming knowledge. The second will enable users to enterimages and data from documents into the system. The third ismade up of workstation products that enable each user toprogram the system to handle specific work applications.Recognition Equipment can sell customers products in eachcategory or bundle them into a complete system.   Recognition Equipment has been involved in opticalscanning products for some time. But in the past few months,the company has shifted its strategic focus from developingspecific, proprietary systems to industry-standard productsthat can be adapted to any customer's equipment, said TomHurley, co-chief executive officer.   The company also is approaching the market differently,Mr. Hurley said, by teaming with computer makers and systemsintegrators to develop complete systems for customers. As anexample, he cited the proposal the company submitted withWang Laboratories Inc. to provide a large state agency withan imaging system that would automate the handling of taxforms. In other projects, the company is teaming withcompanies such as International Business Machines Corp. andAndersen Consulting.   Mr. Hurley said Recognition Equipment is focusing itsmarketing attention on systems for government agencies andtransportation, insurance and financial services companies,all of which handle large amounts of documents. But it hopesto gain business in other market niches through its partners.   Bob Vanourek, co-chief executive, said that the company islooking at the possibility of selling assets that contributeabout $100 million in sales annually, but that only thePostalogic division, which makes mail reading and sortingsystems, has been sold. Because of the difficulty in findingfinancing sources these days, he said, the sale of assetshasn't progressed as quickly as hoped. And he said thecompany isn't under any pressure to sell and may choose tooperate the divisions as autonomous units if adequate bidsdon't emerge.   Mr. Vanourek wouldn't project earnings, but said thecompany is &quot;getting close&quot; to returning to profitability. Forthe first half ended April 30, the company had a net loss of$13 million, wider than the $490,000 loss a year earlier.   Mr. Vanourek also noted that the company increased itscash balances to $45 million at the end of the second quarterfrom about $25 million a year earlier, and attracted somesignificant new outside institutional investors. He alsoestimated that the company's work force has shrunk about 11%to about 2,200 in recent months, and said the major staffreductions &quot;are behind us.&quot;   Messrs Hurley and Vanourek were installed as co-chiefexecutives late last year under an agreement with ProspectGroup, a leveraged buy-out firm that attempted to take overRecognition Equipment. New York-based Prospect owns a 14%stake in the company. Recognition has been mired in eightcivil lawsuits relating to a 1988 indictment that accused thecompany and two of its top officers with attempting tomanipulate the award of $400 million in U.S. Postal Servicecontracts. In November, a federal judge acquitted alldefendants in the case; since then, Mr. Vanourek said, thecompany has settled most of the major litigation stemmingfrom the indictments.</TEXT></DOC>
