Penney Wins Ruling On Workers' Benefits Plan </HL><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT LABOR JCP </CO><IN> INS </IN><DATELINE> CINCINNATI (AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court upheld J.C. Penney Co.'s defense of a policy that permits medical and dental insurance coverage of an employee's spouse only if the spouse earns less than the employee.    A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the &quot;head of household&quot; provision of Penney's insurance plan is lawful under Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. The appeals court's majority ruled against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which argued that the policy amounts to unequal treatment of women employees and was therefore illegal discrimination based on an employee's sex. It ruled that the policy is not sex-based, but is conditioned on a &quot;head of household&quot; status.    Officials for the New York retailer couldn't be reached for comment.    U.S. District Judge Robert DeMascio in Detroit ruled at trial that the policy did have an unequal impact on women workers, but said the EEOC didn't prove that J.C. Penney Co. had a discriminatory motive in adopting the rule.    The appeals court's majority ruled that Judge DeMascio correctly dismissed the complaint because the policy doesn't violate federal civil rights law. </TEXT></DOC>
