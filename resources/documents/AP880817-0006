Such public anger toward the radicals, who represent about 10percent of South Korea's students, is rarely seen in a nation thathas been generally tolerant of student activism. It has shocked thestudents, who see themselves as fighting on behalf of the verypeople criticizing them.   The rising resentment appears to reflect both anger over theradicals' violent tactics and concern for the Olympics, which startin Seoul on Sept. 17.   South Koreans are worried that violent protests at the momentwhen world attention is focused on Seoul could ruin the nation'simage. Most people see the Games as a coming of age, and they wantto impress the world with a major success.   Hundreds of South Koreans took part in counterdemonstrationsagainst the students this past week, calling for an end to violentconfrontations. Newspapers have joined in the criticism.   ``We now call upon our students to return to their senses,'' TheKorea Times said in an editorial Saturday. ``Violence is not theway to solve any problem,'' The Joong-ang Ilbo said.   The radicals battled riot police in parts of Seoul on Monday asthe government blocked them from marching to the North Koreanborder for reunification talks. Scattered violent clashes involvinga few thousand radicals also erupted last weekend.   Twice during the weekend, hundreds of people went to radicalheadquarters at Yonsei University to demand that the studentsleave. The two groups argued and yelled.   Angry onlookers also denounced and heckled student demonstratorsin other parts of Seoul, and newspapers reported similar outburstsin other cities. Elderly people screamed at students, calling themrude and arrogant.   ``You students are not the only Korean patriots!'' one old manshouted.   In the most unusual development, a few people hurled stones atstudents, and some were seen helping riot police fighting theradicals.   Observers have been impressed by the number of peoplespontaneously criticizing the students.   Kim Young-won, a political scientist, said was amazed to seeonlookers cheering on riot police in a street battle againststudents. He said it was remarkable that riot police shouldsuddenly be seen as heroes after years of beng despised forenforcing authoritarian rule.   The change, he said, ``may prove to be the first indication thatcitizens have become weary of the persistent, violent actions ofmisled students.''   Student leaders admit they have failed to gain public support inthe latest round of protests, although they refuse to give up theirstruggle or change their tactics.   ``We should have strengthened our solidarity with the people ...we have to admit our failure in doing so,'' said student leader OhYung-shik.   Students played key roles in battling past authoritarian regimesand many people took to the streets with them in June 1987 to forcePresident Chun Doo-hawn to agree to democratic reforms.   Many South Koreans say the current violent demonstrations are athreat to stability and the nation's efforts to build enduringdemocracy. They also oppose the students advances to communistNorth Korea.   President Roh Tae-woo and other government leaders have warnedrepeatedly that disorder won't be tolerated during the Olympics.   ``The people and the government will not forgive anyone whospoils the (Olympic) festival through mob action or the throwing offirebombs,'' Roh said in a speech Monday.   The radicals have not decided if they will try to disrupt theGames or stage protests. They back North Korea's demand to be aco-host at the Olympics, which the International Olympic Committeehas rejected.   But the students would find it difficult to disrupt the Games.The government is deploying a massive security shield to forestallany threats.</TEXT></DOC>
