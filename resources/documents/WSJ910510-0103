Norman Dicks, a colleaguein the Washington state delegation. &quot;The American people areasking, `Where do the Democrats stand?'&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It is two years -- a full Congress -- since Mr. Foley wasthrust into power after scandal forced the resignation offormer Speaker James Wright. A judge's son, the 62-year-oldMr. Foley has proven a tougher inside player than manypredicted, but his devotion is more to the House as aninstitution than to his position as the highest-rankingDemocrat in the nation.   The calls now for a more activist role coincide with ashift of power between generations in his party. While oldbulls like Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski andEnergy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell remain, the recentretirement of Arizona Rep. Morris Udall and the death offormer Rules Committee Chairman Richard Bolling symbolize thetransition that is under way. &quot;This was the week the oaksfell,&quot; said Rep. David Obey at a service mourning Mr.Bolling.   At the same time, younger Democrats who -- like Mr. Dicks-- came to Congress in the 1970s are fearful that time isrunning out on their generation's chance to make a differenceas legislators. There is &quot;a sense of urgency, whether it'sthe Kurdish kids or our own kids,&quot; says Rep. George Miller, a45-year-old Californian who came to Washington in thepost-Watergate class that identifies closely with Mr. Foley.&quot;He's our speaker, but the speaker has to pick up the flagand charge. That's just a matter of destiny.&quot;   It's a destiny Mr. Foley is often uncomfortable about.&quot;I'm not a presidential candidate and never will be. I don'twant to assert or claim some extraordinary voice,&quot; he says.   Only slowly has the speaker begun to stake out his ownagenda. &quot;We are moving inexorably toward a major decision onhealth,&quot; Mr. Foley says. To stimulate the economy and rebuildthe nation's infrastructure, he backs an increased gasolinetax and leaves open the option that part could be appliedagainst the deficit. He has elevated Democratic Rep. JohnLewis of Georgia, a symbol of the party's civil-rightsheritage, to the leadership steering and policy committee.Closer to home, he pushes reluctant party rank-and-filers tosend a campaign-finance-reform bill to the president thisyear. &quot;It's not going to go away,&quot; he says of the issue.&quot;There are real problems in the system that need to beaddressed.&quot;   With Mr. Foley, the House has had to adjust to theleadership style of a man very different from the speakersbefore him. Mr. Wright and Speaker Thomas O'Neill, who putMr. Foley on the leadership ladder, were far more forcefuland aggressive. Mr. O'Neill was a personal target forRepublicans in the early 1980s. Mr. Wright's short but fiercetenure came as Democrats pushed through a pent-up agenda inthe last years of Ronald Reagan's weakened presidency.   By comparison, Mr. Foley is faced with a less ideologicalpresident in George Bush. Moreover, the temper of the timesis different: Democrats are less of a political target thesedays than is the Congress itself. As a result, Mr. Foleyargues that he best serves his party by upholding the Houseagainst conservative attacks bent on reducing confidence inthe institution.   &quot;Above everything else, I am concerned about protectingthe reputation and position of the House as an institution,&quot;Mr. Foley says. &quot;It happens to be one of the foundations ofDemocratic Party influence in the country. That is not loston me.&quot;   His support of campaign reform reflects this sensitivity.Similarly, his pressure for a budget accord last year wasdriven by a concern that the House be seen to act. In thehistoric debate over the war with Iraq, Mr. Foley opposed theconflict but knew early on that he would lose in January'svote. His insistence on an even-handed, neutral debateangered hawks on the House Foreign Affairs Committee -- yetby doing so, he helped deliver a House better able to closeranks behind the president's prosecution of the war once thevote was over.   &quot;There is more method to him than people realize,&quot; saysMassachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank. And with the newCongress, more assertiveness. Mr. Foley remade the Democraticleadership committee in his image, using this power tostrengthen allies, like Mr. Dicks, and reach out to thoselike Rep. Marty Russo of Illinois who opposed him in theoften destructive budget debate last fall.   The speaker has had his share of scraps. He banged heads-- including Mr. Rostenkowski's -- on the Clean Air Act lastyear and waged a prolonged fight with Mr. Dingell over whowould serve on the House-Senate conference committee on thebill. The two men remain cordial, but the chairman, whorefused comment, was so furious he withdrew as sponsor of aDemocratic campaign dinner last year as a protest.   Mr. Foley's actions served to reassert his prerogatives asspeaker, but muscle still isn't in his nature.   His benefactor, Mr. O'Neill, conducted meetings frombehind a huge desk and loved the classic John Ford-VictorMcLaglen movie, &quot;The Informer,&quot; an Irish story of betrayal.Mr. Foley's office today resembles a salon, and his taste inmovies runs to &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets,&quot; an Alex Guinnessblack comedy.   &quot;I want civilized fights, I like sweet reason,&quot; he says,laughing. But he adds, &quot;I don't think of myself as unwillingto fight, and I think it's a big mistake for people to thinkthat.&quot;   For years, Mr. Foley's image has been that of anindecisive intellectual. In fact, though, his friends tend tobe very assertive people, and he is often decisive about hisown positions. He just prefers to wait for others to come tothe same conclusions for themselves.   It is a style that depends on reason and time to prevail.What is missing for some is the muscular direction soidentified with past speakers. Even one of Mr. Foley'sfriends worries that he too often plays &quot;prime minister&quot; toGeorge Bush's &quot;king.&quot; The two men have a good relationship,in contrast to the tensions between the White House andSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell. The president invitedthe speaker for a weekend at Camp David this winter, and Mr.Foley was unfailingly sympathetic to Mr. Bush in the tensedays before the war began.   Their relationship made it all the more striking that Mr.Foley didn't use his position to encourage the administrationto respond more quickly to the plight of the Kurdishrefugees. &quot;I don't want to do anything political,&quot; he saidwhen pressed on the issue. Why be speaker, he was asked, ifnot to pick up the phone? &quot;I can pick up the phone, but Idon't think I should abuse it,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe I am tooreticent about it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
