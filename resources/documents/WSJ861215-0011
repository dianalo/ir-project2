Ministerial sources and OPEC delegates said the organization suspended its plenary meeting of oil ministers yesterday so the proposals could be refined in private talks.    Iraq, meanwhile, said that while it refuses to accept any quota assigned to it by OPEC, its government reserves the right to unilaterally lower oil production. This led many delegates here to again express optimism that the conference will successfully yield an agreement that will push oil prices up from their present level of $14 a barrel.    Iran has said that any new agreement to reduce production must include the participation of Iraq, which has been allowed since August to produce as much oil as it can.    Delegates said that experts and ministers are still haggling over what is the anticipated demand for OPEC oil next year, among other things.    The most pessimistic outlook is that demand may be as low as 15.8 million barrels a day in the first quarter, compared with the current output of about 17.3 million barrels a day. The most optimistic estimate is that the oil markets may need as much as 17.1 million barrels a day, sources said.    Other issues under discussion include a sharper definition of OPEC's goal to fix oil prices at about $18 a barrel in a way that reflects differences among the various types of crude oil produced by the 13 members of the group.    OPEC said it will resume its plenary session today.    Few delegates expressed anxiety that Iran's insistence on Iraq's participation in a reduction of output could reverse the course of this conference, the first time in two years OPEC seems headed for a solid resolution.    Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Agazadeh has kept silent on his intentions, but Arab sources said it was unlikely that Iran, which engineered the organization's drive for higher oil prices in August, now would abandon its campaign to prop up prices. Iran needs the added revenue to finance its seven-year-old war with Iraq and consolidate its primacy in OPEC. Iranian sources said their aim is to push prices even higher, toward a goal of $28 a barrel, in the next few OPEC meetings.    &quot;Since August we have pushed the price up by almost $5 (a barrel),&quot; said one Arab oil minister who asked not to be identified. &quot;This is part of Iran's overall goal. I don't see them sabotaging that now.&quot;    Other potential sources of conflict within the organization remain the overproduction of oil by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, both of which have exceeded their allotted quotas since the October meeting of OPEC.    But overproduction by those countries has been offset by the inability of Iran to export as much oil as it is allowed to do under the present accord because of persistent bombing of its oil-loading ports by the Iraqi air force. The attacks have blocked the export of an average 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil a day by Iran since summer.    Overshadowing all these concerns is the worry here over whether OPEC can make any decision on higher prices hold in the face of the oil glut that continues in world markets. Should customers desert OPEC in favor of cheaper oil available from nonmembers, poor OPEC countries such as Ecuador, Gabon, Nigeria, Indonesia and others may not be able to withstand the pressure for more than a few weeks before they revert to discounts and upset the higher-price scheme. </TEXT></DOC>
