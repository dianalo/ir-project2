Coal quality influences all aspects of power plantperformance, particularly environmental control system design and operation,and therefore is significant in determining electricity costs. The strongdependence of environmental control costs on coal composition requiresfuel selection and coal quality decisions support environmental controlstrategies. This paper summarizes how coal cleaning allows less complexand costly environmental controls to be applied. Changes in fuel compositiondue to, and the costs for, coal cleaning are first reviewed. Higher boilerefficiency possible through lower air heater gas exit temperature isthen summarized. Finally, the potential of cleaned coal to reduce environmentalcontrol capital and operating costs is summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
