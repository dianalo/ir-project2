The group released a report compiled by a national environmentallobby that said Bush, as vice president, took or endorsed numeroussteps that have harmed or endangered the nation's waters andwetlands.   ``George Bush was not an idle spectator in the Reaganadministration's assault on the environment,'' said the report byClean Water Action. ``Rather, for eight years, he aggressivelypursued an agenda which responded to the special interests ofpolluters and resulted in massive destruction of wetlandsthroughout the country.''   The report focused on Bush's role as chairman of a regulatorytask force that rescinded or relaxed several regulations affectingsewage treatment and wetlands protection programs.   The group also credited Dukakis with beginning the cleanup ofBoston Harbor despite cutbacks in federal cleanup funds because ofReagan administration cuts endorsed by Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
