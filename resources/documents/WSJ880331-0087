Instead, the auto makers took the unusual, and incremental, step of asking the Commerce Department merely to &quot;consult&quot; with the Japanese in an effort to stop the alleged dumping, or selling products in the U.S. at a lower price than in the home market. Still, the domestic producers held out the possiblity of ultimately filing formal charges that dumping had damaged their business, a case that could be difficult to prove given the Big Three's near-record overall profits last year.    The allegations about dumping of compact pickups are being watched as a first salvo in a possibly larger battle: the domestic auto makers, particularly General Motors Corp., have raised the specter of Japan's dumping cars in the U.S. The importers have repeatedly, and again yesterday, denied they are dumping any vehicles in the U.S.    In a letter to Commerce Secretary William Verity, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which represents the Big Three and five other domestic vehicle makers, said its investigation found several Japanese auto makers selling compact pickups in the U.S. at a lower price than in Japan. The association claimed that the difference in price ranged from 10.9% to an extraordinary 46.9%.    But claiming that the Japanese are discounting prices isn't enough to prove dumping under trade law. Domestic manufacturers must also prove injury, such as a drop in profits or employment, and that is where the Big Three may run into problems. U.S. sales of domestically made compact pickup trucks jumped 17% to 795,000 trucks in 1987 compared with 1986. Sales of Japanese imports, hurt by the rising yen and resulting retail price increases, dropped 19% to 609,000 compact pickup trucks.    &quot;It's very hard to understand an injury claim when the domestic auto industry's truck sales are reaching record levels,&quot; said Richard D. Recchia, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the U.S. sales arm of Mitsubishi Motors Corp., one of the companies accused of dumping. The association of U.S. auto makers also accused Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Ltd., Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Mazda Motor Corp. of dumping.    The Big Three, however, are arguing injury on the basis of lost opportunity, a claim some analysts see as more speculative. A report accompanying the trade association's letter to the commerce secretary concluded, &quot;Had the Japanese been required to sell at fair value prices, their sales would have been far lower, and the sales of U.S.-made trucks far higher, than actual levels.&quot;    Specifically, the trade group said the domestic industry would have been able to sell an additional 140,000 compact pickups in 1987 if the Japanese hadn't dumped vehicles in the U.S. Those sales would have translated into at least an additional $130 million in profit and $140 million in industry wages and benefits, the association said. It also suggested that car assembly plants that are being shut down might have been converted to making pickup trucks, saving thousands of jobs.    &quot;The fact that our sales are increasing doesn't mean that there isn't injury,&quot; George Eads, GM's chief economist, said in an interview last week. Still, it is unclear if profit in the domestic compact-pickup industry is actually down, and if so, whether that is the result of dumping or simple competition. &quot;If you're measuring return on sales, the rate of return (on compact pickup trucks) is down&quot; said John Greenwald, a lawyer with the Washington firm of Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickering, which prepared the trade association's investigation. But Mr. Greenwald said he hadn't calculated whether total profit in dollars is off.    He added, however, that the average rate of return on sales of compact pickups is less than 1%. &quot;This industry isn't an industry I would call robust,&quot; he said. &quot;If you were being paid a subsistence wage, you would be complaining long and hard about current injury.&quot;    The Commerce Department didn't immediately respond to the trade group's letter and report.    The Big Three are couching their compact pickup initiative in broad terms, saying fair international trade is at issue. The Japanese, they claim, haven't passed along an appropriate amount of the yen's appreciation in the form of higher retail prices, and that is helping sustain the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Last year, that deficit hit $60 billion, about $22 billion of which was in new-car trade.    Mr. Greenwald also claims importers have skirted the question of whether they are selling pickups in the U.S. at a lower price than in Japan. Indeed, at Toyota at least, a spokesman for the company's U.S. sales arm yesterday said unequivocally, &quot;We aren't dumping.&quot; But he added: &quot;There's no way we can say whether one price is lower than the other. We are not going to go into this unless they (the U.S. firms) file. That's as clear as we can be.&quot;    Last week, a Canadian tribunal rejected claims by Canadian subsidiaries of Ford Motor Co. and GM that their business was injured by imports of low-priced Hyundai Motor Co. cars from South Korea. The U.S. trade association, however, says its effort isn't affected by that case.    Sources, meanwhile, say GM is the prime mover behind yesterday's complaint. They add that some analysts at Ford have expressed concern over whether injury can actually be proved. Ford, in fact, has kept a low profile in the controversy, declining reporters' requests for interviews on the company's role. Chrysler Corp., which imports the Dodge Ram 50 compact pickup truck from Mitsubishi, also has let GM take the lead. </TEXT></DOC>
