(Indiana) bought its way into the ranks of Big Oil, paying $380 million for 90 U.S. and Canadian oil fields and 1,114 producing wells. Since then, Amoco Corp., as it is now known, has mostly preferred to drill for its oil rather than buy it.    So Amoco's announcement last weekend that it intends to buy Calgary, Alberta-based Dome Petroleum Ltd. for $5.1 billion (Canadian), or the U.S. equivalent of about $3.87 billion, raised some industry eyebrows. Buying Dome, which is resource-rich but cash-poor, seems to represent a substantial change in the course Amoco has charted for the last 26 years. During that time Amoco has become the nation's biggest holder of domestic oil and gas acreage. In 1986, about $3.5 billion of Amoco's exploration revenue of $6.3 billion came from domestic holdings.    Amoco's move also represents a concrete signal that the days of major U.S. oil exploration may be coming to a close. Just last month Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer, described the U.S. as a &quot;mature&quot; oil region with a limited exploratory future.    Amoco officials said that Dome notwithstanding, they aren't about to turn their backs on the U.S. One executive at Amoco's Chicago headquarters said: &quot;Exploration and production in the U.S. is still extremely important. What we have simply discovered is that we can't replace our domestic reserves with our own discoveries.&quot;    However, Amoco may face a fight for Dome. The stock was the most active issue on both the Toronto and American stock exchanges yesterday, closing far above the $1.50-a-share (Canadian) value of the Amoco bid because of speculation of a higher offer from Toronto-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. or a third bidder, possibly a European oil company. Although industry sources said TransCanada, whose previous bid was valued at $4.3 billion, may make an announcement as soon as today, several analysts warned that the stock may still be overvalued.    On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dome common closed at $1.70, up 20 cents, on volume of 2.4 million shares. On the American Stock Exchange, Dome closed at $1.25 (U.S.), up 6.25 cents, on volume of 2.3 million shares.    Robert Robinson, an energy consultant to Loewen, Ondaatje, McCutcheon andamp; Co., a Toronto securities dealer, warned that any sweetened offer is likely to benefit creditors more than shareholders. He added that shareholders still face a small risk that they could get nothing for their stock because Dome's unsecured creditors could choose to put the company into bankruptcy proceedings.    Mr. Robinson said creditors probably won't liquidate Dome through bankruptcy because they will receive more if the company is sold as a going concern, with tax benefits intact. But he pointed out that under the Amoco offer, some unsecured creditors may receive as little as 35 cents on the dollar for their debt. These creditors could become annoyed if they think shareholders are getting too much.    Victor Vallance, an analyst with Wood Gundy Ltd., Toronto, said that the purchase of Dome stock &quot;involves sheer speculation and enormous risk,&quot; partly because of the bankruptcy risk. He added that unless a sweetened offer materializes, the time value of money suggests that Dome's stock would be trading below $1.50 (Canadian) because it may take six to nine months before an acquisition is completed and shareholders are paid.    Amoco officials said they don't expect a fight for Dome. &quot;We have a binding agreement with Dome and we're going to do everything we can to help the government understand this is the best thing for Canada,&quot; said T. Don Stacy, president of the Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. unit. Mr. Stacy declined to say whether Amoco was prepared to wage a bidding fight for Dome.    &quot;I hope Dome's shareholders are sophisticated enough to know this is essentially a bankrupt company and the value of its shares in a liquidation situation would be essentially nil,&quot; Mr. Stacy said.    If Amoco acquires Dome, it will get proven reserves of about 144 million barrels of oil, 47 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 1.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Perhaps as enticing are Dome's 21.9 million acres of unexplored land, about half of which is in western Canada and the remainder in Arctic frontier areas.    The cost of Amoco's bid for Dome comes to the equivalent of about $5.20 (U.S.) a barrel of oil. &quot;That's quite reasonable&quot; compared with Amoco's cost of drilling for oil, said Don Bustos, oil analyst for Duff andamp; Phelps in Chicago.    Analysts say it appears Amoco will be getting a good deal if it manages to acquire Dome at its bid price. But just how good a deal isn't clear. Amoco hasn't disclosed the ratio of cash to securities it plans to offer Dome's creditors, nor has it said what the securities conversion price will be.    &quot;Amoco is shifting from its traditional policy of growing from within to increasing its base in Canada through what may be a one-time change in policy,&quot; said Richard Hallisey, oil analyst for First Marathon Securities Ltd. in Toronto.    Thomas Petrie, an oil analyst for First Boston Corp., said &quot;Amoco has held back while other oil companies have been buying and selling each other. The Dome transaction goes a long way toward answering a primary question in Amoco investors' minds: Where will Amoco put its strong cash flows in the future?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
