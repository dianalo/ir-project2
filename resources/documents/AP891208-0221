SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite all the ink Hollywood gets, defensehas become a far higher-flying industry in Southern Californiasince the days of World War II's ``Rosie the Riveter'' and thelegendary Lockheed ``Skunk Works.''   Now, with the Iron Curtain rusting away by the day, aerospaceworkers are wondering what is to become of their industry, thirdlargest in the Los Angeles region after business-financial servicesand tourism.   There were 420,800 aerospace workers in the area last year,2,700 fewer than in 1987, according to a study released this monthby the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. They made up about 7percent of the region's workers and earned nearly 8 percent of thewages paid.   National aerospace employment peaked at 1,313,000 in 1987 andhas stayed about even since, said David Napier, economic dataservice manager at the Aerospace Industries Association inWashington.   Research suggests every 1 percent cut in real defense spendingcosts California 20,000 to 30,000 jobs directly or indirectly, saidDavid Hensley, head of UCLA's California economic forecasting group.   Will efforts by some contractors to diversify into civilianaerospace and high-tech be enough to offset a thawing of the ColdWar?   ``I was at an international aerospace conference, and a guythere said he could see Southern California being the `rust belt'of the 1990s,'' said Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace analyst who nowheads the research department at UBS Securities in New York.   ``It was just said in passing, of course. As usual at thesethings, there is somebody who throws you a grenade just to wake upthe audience.''   At places like Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft Co., they wokeup long ago to the reality that defense spending, after inflationadjustments, has been declining for years.   ``We're not abandoning the defense sector. We regard that as ourduty to the nation,'' said D. Kenneth Richardson, who was appointedpresident of Hughes earlier this month. ``But we feel that in thefuture most of the growth and opportunity are outside defense.''   Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., is completing asix-month streamlining that includes 6,000 layoffs among its 75,000workers because of tighter defense budgets. An additional 4,100employees were laid off in 1986.   The satellites and defense electronics company is also movinginto such areas as telecommunications and simulation and trainingsystems for commercial airlines. It recently won a $325 millioncontract to modernize Canada's air-traffic control system and isbidding on a $210 million contract to upgrade data processing atthe federal Bureau of Land Management.   ``I'm an upbeat, positive sort of fellow and I think thecompany's future is very good,'' said Richardson.   If less money for the military is accompanied by more for space,Southern California would benefit. Millions of dollars a year fromthe space program already have flooded in.   For example, El Segundo-based Rockwell International, builder ofthe space shuttle, said recently it had received a contract worth``several hundred million dollars'' to build spare parts for theshuttle.   Also boding well for the industry is civilian aircraft work,where employment is growing fast.   The Chamber of Commerce study estimated that Seattle-basedBoeing Co., overloaded with orders for civilian aircraft,subcontracts about $2 billion worth of work each year to SouthernCalifornia firms.   The main bodies on Boeing 747s are assembled by LosAngeles-based Northrop Corp., which is vulnerable to militarybudget cutters because of its own $500 million-per-plane stealthbomber program.   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in LongBeach has added many workers because of a backlog of orders forMD-80 commercial jets and the launching of its MD-11 and MD-90aircraft.   Longer term, if defense cuts helped lower the national deficit,California and other areas could benefit from lower interest ratesthat would generate more jobs, some economists contend.   Fred Cannon, senior economist for Bank of America, said lessdefense spending also might be a blessing ``because there's notmuch of what economists call `value added' in that segment.''   ``When you make items for the military, you're basicallyproducing something and then just storing it,'' Cannon said. ``Inother parts of the economy ... you're producing something, sellingit, servicing it, maybe reselling it and on and on _ there's muchmore value added.''   Severe cuts in defense contracting would close a post-World WarII era in Southern California littered with lore, from JohnNorthrop retiring in 1952, broken-hearted that his Flying Wingbomber was canceled, to the maiden flight of Northrop's B-2 stealthbomber _ a flying wing _ last July.   Perhaps even more famous is Lockheed's so-called Skunk Works inBurbank, site of the development of the P-80 jet fighter in 1945,then the U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird spy planes, and in this decadethe stealth fighter.   Subcultures grew up around the industry, like the throngs thatparked near the Burbank airport on Friday nights, hoping that ahuge C-5 cargo plane would descend onto darkened Runway 7 and pullup to Lockheed's Skunk Works to pick up classified loads.   Dave Rockwell, a C-5 watcher since 1983, was part of a networkof fanatics who would videotape the C-5s as they zoomed in to pickup what was assumed to be Lockheed stealth fighters, so secret theyofficially did not exist.   ``Not so many people show up now,'' Rockwell said. ``It onlycomes in about every 10 weeks, instead of every four or five weeksbefore.''  </TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 10</NOTE></DOC>
