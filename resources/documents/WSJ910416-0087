In it she included analmost obligatory trashing of the white man's impact upon theIndian (&quot;my heart aches for what is past&quot;).   This is the same politically correct (and factuallyone-sided) historical revisionism brought to the screen byKevin Costner's recent &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;: the nobleAmerican Indian, possessed of an almost mystical reverencefor nature, awash with respect for his fellow man, at themercy of the callous white Euro-American bumpkin invaderswith superior technology.</LP><TEXT>   Should Ms. Rudner ever commit enough effort to the otherside of the story regarding the Indians and the whites, shewill find that, long before the arrival of the firstEuropeans in North America, the American Indians, like allother races of the earth, were sadly subject to andperpetrators of ecological crimes (in fact, they eventuallyused the horse, which was introduced by the Spanish, to huntout bison and elk more effectively, rather than the older,&quot;purer&quot; Indian form of either setting wildfires to burn themalive by the hundreds, or the more taxing method of simplyexhausting them by running them to earth on foot, thenkilling them by shooting them with multiple arrows);intertribal genocide; torture and heinously cruel executionof other Indians captured in battle, and even human sacrificein certain religious or seasonal rites. Not that the Indianswere selfish with the application of these skills, either --they later democratically used them against the whites,soldier and civilian, man, woman and child alike.   Perhaps that is why the mood of the time dictated that theNorthern Cheyenne (a tribe I personally hold in very highesteem) suffered as they did. For Ms. Rudner convenientlyfails to point out that the Cheyenne, along with the Sioux,were one of the last of the warlike tribes to be so subdued,and that one of the reasons for the severity of theirpunishment was that news of their massacre of severalcompanies of George Custer's luckless Seventh Cavalry wasreceived in Washington just as the nation was celebrating itsCentennial in 1876. This was the last straw for a nationcelebrating its first century, and which at the timeconsidered itself civilized; the backlash, to say the least,was predictably severe. But North America was peopled then bymuch harder folk than some of those who are today'sself-appointed apologists.   Now, more than a century later, it is voguish for those ofMs. Rudner's sensibilities to lament the passing of the &quot;goodold days.&quot; I submit that if Ms. Rudner were catapulted backto the frontier of the mid-19th century she quickly would besinging a drastically different tune.
