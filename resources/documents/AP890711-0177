A meeting ``without any significant political change by the whiteminority regime would send a terribly wrong signal concerning thedirection of U.S. policy,'' said a letter sent to Bush prior to hisdeparture for Europe and released here Tuesday.   The letter bore the names of 51 House Democrats and more signersare being added, said the office of Rep. William H. Gray III,D-Pa.,the House majority whip who cosponsored the letter with Reps.Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., and Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.   Dellums is author of South African sanctions legislation beforethe House. Wolpe is African affairs subcommittee chairman.   De Klerk, leader of South Africa's governing National Party andheir-apparent to President P.W. Botha, has been invited to visitWashington by Secretary of State James Baker III but no date hasbeen set, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.   Questions of whether Bush would receive De Klerk were earlierreferred to the travelling White House.   The June 29 Congressional letter praised Bush for meetinganti-apartheid leaders such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Rev. AllanBoesak, Rev. Beyers Naude and Albertina Sisulu.   Besides asking for an end to South Africa's state of emergencyand release of political prisoners, the letter listed otherconditions for meeting government leaders. The letter said politicalorganizations should be banned in South Africa and restrictions onleaders of extra-parliamentary groups should be ended.</TEXT></DOC>
