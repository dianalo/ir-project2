Cavazos says he's been asked why he would leave his job as auniversity president to take on the complexities and challenges ofeducation secretary when it's for just a few months. Sworn in Sept.20, Cavazos is the first Hispanic member of a president's Cabinetand serves until Jan. 20, unless renominated by the next president.   ``I see it as an opportunity, a platform so to speak, as youfolks in Washington call it _ a window of opportunity _ to saysomething, to give some leadership to the things I've been sayingall along as a university president,'' said Cavazos, who is on leavefrom Texas Tech University.   In his first speech after taking over as president of the Lubbockuniversity in 1980, Cavazos said he used the occasion to talk aboutthe dropout rate, especially among Hispanics. In Texas, he said, 45percent of Hispanic students drop out before finishing high school,while the rate for blacks is 32 percent and for Anglos, 30.   ``I learned long ago that people don't necessarily listen to auniversity president, and I'm not sure they listen to secretaries ofeducation, but we're going to speak up,'' he said.   Principal issues, he said, include helping the highly motivatedstudent excel and move ahead; getting the dropouts back in schooland into the mainstream of society; teaching the illiterate how toread; educating the handicapped to their fullest level ofindependence; and helping the dyslexic overcome their learningdisability.   ``That is the agenda of America: That you educate everyone totheir fullest potential,'' he said.   ``If one person drops out, we're all the poorer for thatreason,'' he said.   He said he hopes to position the Department of Education to``start thinking about these issues ... to start thinking about thefuture _ where do you want this place to go, so regardless of who issecretary of education, the agenda is pretty well laid out.''</TEXT></DOC>
