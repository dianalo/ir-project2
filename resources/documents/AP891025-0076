Miss Midler is suing Ford and the Young andamp; Rubicam advertisingagency for $10 million over a 1986 television commercial forMercury Sable automobiles.   The lawsuit contends the use of a sound-alike voice to recreatea variation of Miss Midler's 1972 hit ``Do Ya Wanna Dance'' wasunfair competition and infringement of the right to publicity.   Robert M. Callagy, an attorney for Young andamp; Rubicam, admittedthat the commercial imitated Miss Midler but he denied anywrongdoing under federal copyright laws.   ``We had the right to imitate the Midler sound recording,''Callagy said. ``It was consistent with the law.''   Young andamp; Rubicam hired one of Miss Midler's former backup singersto perform the song after Miss Midler's manager turned down anoffer for her to do the ad.   Howard Privett, an attorney for Ford, said the automaker was notinvolved in making the commercial and only approved it for airing.   Miss Midler, whose recent films include ``Beaches'' and``Outrageous Fortune,''was not in court Tuesday but was expected totestify later.</TEXT></DOC>
