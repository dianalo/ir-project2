In such instances claims will not be settled under lawsor regulations of the United States. (b) The prohibition stated in paragraph (a) of this section is not applicableto claims within the purview of Article VIII of the Agreement Regardingthe Status of Forces of Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty or similartype agreements which normally will be investigated and settled as thereinprovided. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Claims. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Who may present. </T3>(1) A claim may be presented by the owner ofthe property, or in his name by a duly authorized agent or legal representative.As used in this regulation an owner includes the following: (i) <T3>For real property. </T3>The mortgagor, or the mortgagee, if he or shecan maintain a cause of action in the local courts involving a tort tothat specific property. When notice of divided interests in real propertyis received, the claim should, if feasible, be treated as a single claimor a release from all interests must be obtained. (ii) <T3>For personal property. </T3>A bailee, leasee, mortgagee, and conditionalvendor, or others having title for purposes of security only, are not properclaimants unless specifically authorized by the statute and implementingregulations in question. If more than one party has a real interest inthe property, all must join in the claim or a release from all interestsmust be obtained. (2) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured personor duly authorized agent or legal representative. (3) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or administratorof the deceased's estate, or by any person determined to be legally orbeneficially entitled. The amount allowed will, to the extent practicable,be apportioned among the beneficiaries in accordance with the law applicableto the incident. (4) A claim for medical, hospital, or burial expenses may be presentedby any person who by reason of family relationship has in fact incurredthe expenses for which the claim is made. However, for claims cognizableunder the provisions of the FTCA, see andSection; 536.50, and for claimscognizable under the provisions of the Nonscope of Employment Claims Act,see andSection;andSection; 536.90 through 536.97. (5) A claim presented by an agent or legal representative will be madein the name of the claimant and signed by the agent or legal representativeshowing the title or capacity. Written evidence of the authority of suchperson to act is mandatory except when controlling law does not requiresuch evidence. (6) A claim normally will include all damages that accrue by reason ofthe incident. Where the same claimant has a claim for damage to or lossof property and a claim for personal injury or a claim based on death arisingout of the same incident, each of the foregoing or any combination of themordinarily represent only an integral part or parts of a single claim orcause of action. Under andSection;andSection; 536.20 through 536.35 and theForeign Claims Act (FCA) (10 U.S.C. 2734), a single claimant is entitledto be compensated only one time for all damages or injuries arising outof an incident. (b) <T3>Subrogation. </T3>A claim may be presented by a subrogee in his ownname if authorized by the law of the place where the incident giving riseto the claim occurred, provided subrogation is not barred by the regulationapplicable to the type of claim involved. (1) The claims of the subrogor (insured) and subrogee (insurer) for damagesarising out of the same incident constitute separate claims, and it ispermissible for the aggregate of such claims to exceed the monetary jurisdictionof the approving or settlement authority. (2) A subrogor and a subrogee may file a claim jointly or individually.A fully subrogated claim will be paid only to the subrogee. Whether a claimis fully subrogated is a matter to be determined by local law. Some jurisdictionspermit the property owner to file for property damage even though the ownerhas been compensated for the repairs by an insurer. In such instances arelease should be obtained from both parties in interest or be releasedby both of them. The approved payment in a joint claim will be by jointcheck which will be sent to the subrogee unless both parties specify otherwise.If separate claims are filed, payment will be by check issued to each claimantto the extent of his undisputed interest. (3) Where a claimant has made an election and accepted workmen's compensationbenefits, both statutory and case law of the jurisdiction should be scrutinizedto determine to what extent the claim of the injured party against thirdparties has been extinguished by acceptance of compensation benefits. Whileit is infrequent that the claim is fully extinguished, it is true in somejurisdictions, and the only proper party claimant is the workmen's compensationcarrier. Even where the injured party's claim has not been fully extinguished,most jurisdictions provide that the compensation insurance carrier hasa lien on any recovery from the third party, and no settlement should bereached without approval by the carrier where required by local law. Additionally,claims from the workmen's compensation carrier as subrogee or otherwisewill not be considered payable where the United States has paid the premiums,directly or indirectly, for the workmen's compensation insurance. Applicablecontract provisions holding the United States harmless should be utilized.(4) Whether medical payments paid by an insurer to its insured can be subrogateddepends on local law. Some jurisdictions prohibit these claims to be submittedby the insurer notwithstanding a contractual provision providing for subrogation.Therefore, local law should be researched prior to deciding the issue,and claims forwarded to higher headquarters for adjudication should containthe results of said research. Such claims, where prohibited by state law,will also be barred by the Antiassignment Act. (5) Care will be exercised to require insurance disclosure consistent withthe type of incident generating the claim. Every claimant will, as a partof his claim, make a written disclosure concerning insurance coverage asto: (i) The name and address of every insurer; (ii) The kind and amount of insurance; (iii) Policy number; (iv) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, and,if so, the amount of such claims; and (v) Whether the insurer has paid the claim in whole or in part, or hasindicated payment will be made.(6) Each subrogee must substantiate his interest or right to file a claimby appropriate documentary evidence and should support the claim as toliability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of anyother claimant. Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does notconstitute evidence either of liability of the Government or of the amountof damages. Approving and settlement authorities will make independentdeterminations upon the evidence of record and the law. (7) Subrogated claims are not cognizable under andSection;andSection; 536.90through 536.97 and the FCA (10 U.S.C. 2734). (c) <T3>Transfer and assignments.</T3> (1) Except as they occur by operationof law or after a voucher for the payment has been issued, unless withinthe exceptions set forth by statute (see 31 U.S.C. 3727 and AR 37-107),the following are null and void_(i) Every purported transfer or assignment of a claim against the UnitedStates, or of any part of or interest in a claim, whether absolute or conditional.(ii) Every power of attorney or other purported authority to receive paymentof all or part of any such claim. (2) The purposes of the Antiassignment Act are to eliminate multiple paymentof claims, to cause the United States to deal only with original parties,and to prevent persons of influence from purchasing claims against theUnited States. (3) In general, this statute prohibits voluntary assignments of claimswith the exception of transfers or assignments made by operation of law.The operation of law exception has been held to apply to claims passingto assignees because of bankruptcy proceedings, assignments for the benefitof creditors, corporate liquidations, consolidations or reorganizations,and where title passes by operation of law to heirs or legatees. Subrogatedclaims which arise under a statute are not barred by the AntiassignmentAct. For example, subrogated worker's compensation claims are cognizablewhen presented by the insurer. (4) Subrogated claims which arise pursuant to contractual provisions maybe paid to the subrogee if the subrogated claim is recognized by statestatute or decision. For example, an insurer under an automobile insurancepolicy becomes subrogated to the rights of a claimant upon payment of aproperty damage claim. Generally, such subrogated claims are authorizedby state law and are therefore not barred by the Antiassignment Act. (5) Before claims are paid, it is necessary to determine whether theremay be a valid subrogated claim under Federal or State statute or subrogationcontract held valid by State law. If there may be a valid subrogated claimforthcoming, payment should be withheld for this portion of the claim.If it is determined that claimant is the only proper party, full settlementis authorized. (d) <T3>Action by claimant_</T3>(1) <T3>Form of claim.</T3> The claimant will submit his claim using authorizedofficial forms whenever practicable. A claim is filed only when the elementsindicated in andSection; 536.3(c) have been supplied in writing by a personauthorized to present a claim, unless the claim is cognizable under a regulationthat specifies otherwise. A claim may be amended by the claimant at anytime prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant'soption under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). (2) <T3>Signatures.</T3> (i) The claim and all other papers will be signedin ink by the claimant or by his duly authorized agent. Such signaturewill include the first name, middle initial, and surname. A married womanmust sign her claim in her given name, for example, ``Mary A. Doe,'' ratherthan ``Mrs. John Doe.'' (ii) Where the claimant is represented, the supporting evidence requiredby paragraph (a)(5) of this section will be required only if the claimis signed by the agent or legal representative. However, in all cases inwhich a claimant is represented, the name and address of the representativewill be included in the file together with copies of all correspondenceand records of conversations and other contacts maintained and includedin the file. Frequently, these records are determinative as to whetherthe statute of limitations has been tolled. (3) <T3>Presentation.</T3> The claim should be presented to the commandingofficer of the unit involved, or to the legal office of the nearest Armypost, camp, or station, or other military establishment convenient to theclaimant. In a foreign country where no appropriate commander is stationed,the claim should be submitted to any attache of the U.S. Armed Forces.Claims cognizable under Article VIII of the Agreement Regarding the Statusof Forces of Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty, Article XVIII of theTreaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States andJapan regarding facilities and areas and the Status of United States ArmedForces in Japan (Japan SOFA) or other similar treaty or agreement are filedwith designated claims officials of the receiving State. (e) <T3>Evidence to be submitted by claimant.</T3> The claimant should submitthe evidence necessary to substantiate his claim. It is essential thatindependent evidence be submitted which will substantiate the correctnessof the amount claimed. (f) <T3>Statute of limitations_</T3>(1) <T3>General.</T3> Each statute available to the Department of the Armyfor the administrative settlement of claims, except the Maritime ClaimsSettlement Act (10 U.S.C. 4802), specifies the time during which the rightto file a claim must be exercised. These statutes of limitations, whichare jurisdictional in nature, are not subject to waiver unless the statuteexpressly provides for waiver. Specific information concerning the periodfor filing under each statute is contained in the appropriate implementingsections of this regulation. (2) <T3>When a claim accrues.</T3> A claim accrues on the date on which thealleged wrongful act or omission results in an actionable injury or damageto the claimant or his decedent. Exceptions to this general rule may existwhere the claimant does not know the cause of injury or death; that is,the claim accrues when the injured party, or someone acting on his or herbehalf, knows both the existence and the cause of his or her injury. However,this exception does not apply when, at a later time, he or she discoversthat the acts inflicting the injury may constitute medical malpractice.(See <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Kubrick,</T3> 444 U.S. 111, 100 S. Ct. 352 (1979).) The discovery ruleis not limited to medical malpractice claims; it has been applied to diversesituations involving violent death, chemical and atomic testing, and erosionand hazardous work environment. In claims for indemnity or contributionagainst the United States, the accrual date is the time of the paymentfor which indemnity is sought or on which contribution is based. (3) <T3>Effect of infancy, incompetency or the filing of suit.</T3> The statuteof limitations for administrative claims is not tolled by infancy or incompetency.Likewise, the statute of limitations is not tolled for purposes of filingan administrative claim by the filing of a suit based upon the same incidentin a Federal, State, or local court against the United States or otherparties. (4) <T3>Amendment of Claims.</T3> A claim may be amended by the claimant atany time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant'soption under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). A claim may be amended by changing theamount, the bases of liability, or elements of damages concerning the sameincident. Parties may be added only if the additional party could havefiled a joint claim initially. If the additional party had a separate causeof action, his claim may not be treated as an amendment but only as a separateclaim and is thus barred if the statute of limitations has run. For example,if a claim is timely filed on behalf of a minor for personal injuries,a subsequent claim by a parent for loss of services is considered a separateclaim and is barred if it is not filed prior to the running of the statuteof limitations. Another example is where a separate claim is filed forloss of services or consortium by a spouse arising out of injuries to thehusband or wife of the claimant. On the other hand, if a claim is timelyfiled by an insured for the deductible portion of the property damage,a subsequent claim by the insurer based on payment of property damage toits insured may be filed as an amendment even though the statute of limitationshas run, unless final action has been taken on the insured's claim. (5) <T3>Date of receipt stops the running of the statute.</T3> In computingthe time to determine whether the period of limitations has expired, excludethe first day and include the last day, except when it falls on a nonworkdaysuch as Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which case it is to beextended to the next workday.(g)<T3> By the command concerned_</T3>(1) <T3>General. </T3>If the claim is of a type and amount within the jurisdictionof the claims office of the command concerned and the claim is meritoriousin the amount claimed, it will be approved and paid. If a claim in an amountin excess of the monetary jurisdiction of the claims office is meritoriousin a lesser amount within its jurisdiction, the claim may be approved forpayment provided the amount offered is accepted by the claimant in settlementof the claim. If the claim is not of a type within the jurisdiction ofthe claims office, or if the claimant will not accept an amount withinits jurisdiction, the claim with supporting papers and a recommendationfor appropriate action will be forwarded to the next higher claims authority.If the claim is determined to be not meritorious, it will be disapprovedprovided the claims office has settlement authority for claims of the typeand amount involved. Prior to the disapproval of a claim under a particularstatute, a careful review should be made to ensure that the claim is notproperly payable under a different statute or on another basis. (2)<T3> Claims within settlement authority of USARCS or the Attorney General.</T3>A copy of each of the following types of claims will be forwarded immediatelyto the Commander, USARCS: (i) One that appears to be of a type that must be brought to the attentionof the Attorney General in accordance with his or her regulations; (ii) One in which the demand exceeds $15,000; or (iii) One which is a claim under the FTCA (andSection; 536.50) where thetotal of all claims, arising from a single incident, actual or potential,exceeds $25,000. USARCS is responsible for the monitoring and settlementof such claims and will be kept informed on the status of the investigationand processing thereof. Direct liaison and correspondence between the USARCSand the field claims authority or investigator is authorized on all claimsmatters, and assistance will be furnished as required. The field claimsoffice will provide USARCS duplicates of all documentation as it is addedto the field file. This will include all correspondence, memoranda, medicalreports, reports, evaluations, and any other material relevant to the investigationand processing of the claim. (3)<T3> Claims involving privately owned vehicles. </T3>In areas where theFTCA (andSection; 536.50) is applicable, any claim except those under 31U.S.C. 3721, arising out of an accident involving a privately owned vehicledriven by a member of the DA, or by ARNG personnel as defined in andSection;536.71, based on an allegation that the privately owned vehicle travelwas within the scope of employment, should be forwarded without adjudicationdirectly to the Commander, USARCS. Additional information is provided inandSection;andSection; 536.20 through 536.35, 536.90 through 536.97. (4)<T3> Claims within the exclusive jurisdiction of USARCS. </T3>Authorityto settle the following claims has been delegated to the Commander, USARCS,only: (i) Claims of under Article VIII of the Agreement Regarding the Statusof Forces Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty and other treaties or internationalagreements where the United States is the Receiving State; (ii) Claims under andSection; 536.60 (Maritime claims not arising out ofcivil works activities) except as delegated to overseas command claimsservices; (iii) Industrial security claims, DoD Directive 5220.6, 12 August 1985;and (iv) Claims of the U.S. Postal Service. Files of these claims will be forwardeddirectly to the Commander, USARCS, with the report of investigation andsupporting papers, including a memorandum of opinion. (5)<T3> Maritime claims. </T3>(i) A copy of a claim arising out of damage,loss, injury, or death which originates on navigable waters and is notconsidered cognizable under the Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (10U.S.C. 4802-4804) will be forwarded immediately to the Commander, USARCSor appropriate overseas command claims service. A determination will bemade as to whether the claim must be processed under the Suits in AdmiraltyAct or the Public Vessels Act or may be considered administratively. (ii) If a maritime claim cannot be settled administratively, the claimantwill be advised that he must file a suit. (iii) If it is determined that both administrative and judicial remediesare available, the claim may be processed administratively and the claimantadvised of the need to file a suit within 2 years of the date of occurrenceif he chooses his judicial remedy. (iv) If the claim is for damage to property, or injury to person, consummatedon land, a claimant who makes an oral inquiry or demand will be advisedthat no suit can be filed until a period of six months has expired aftera claim in writing is submitted. (v) If it is determined by the Commander, USARCS, that a claim, apparentlymaritime in nature, is not within the maritime jurisdiction, the claimantwill be so advised, and the claim will be returned for processing underthe appropriate section of this regulation. (h)<T3> By district or division engineer. </T3>The district or division engineerarea claims office will take the action of an initial claims authority.Files of unpaid claims should be forwarded directly to USARCS. An informationcopy will be sent to the next higher engineer authority unless such requirementis waived. (i)<T3> By higher settlement authority. </T3>A higher claims settlement authoritymay take action with respect to a claim in the same manner as the initialclaims office. However, if it is determined that any further attempt tosettle the claim would be unwarranted, the claim will be forwarded to theCommander, USARCS, with recommendations. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Determination of liability. </ITAG>(a) In the adjudication of tort claims, the liability of the United Statesgenerally is determined in accordance with the law of the State or countrywhere the act or omission occurred, except that any conflict between locallaw and the applicable United States statute will be resolved in favorof the latter. However, in claims by inhabitants of the United States arisingin foreign countries, liability is determined in accordance with generalprinciples of tort law common to the majority of American jurisdictionsas evidenced by Federal case law and standard legal publications, exceptas it applies to absolute liability. Where liability is not clear or otherissues exist, settlements should truly reflect the uncertainties in theadjudication of such issues. Compromise settlements are encouraged providedagreement can be reached that reflects the reduced value of the damagesas measured against the full value or range of value if such uncertaintiesor issues did not exist and were it possible for the claimant to successfullylitigate the claim. (b) Quantum exclusion. The costs of filing a claim and similar costs, forexample, court costs, bail, interest, inconvenience expenses, or costsof long distance telephone calls or transportation in connection with thepreparation of a claim, are not proper quantum elements and will not beallowed. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Incident to service exclusionary rule. </ITAG>(a)<T3> General. </T3>A claim for personal injury or death of a member ofthe Armed Forces of the United States or a civilian employee of the UnitedStates that accrued incident to his service is not payable under this regulation.A claim for property damage that accrued incident to the service of a memberof the Armed Forces may be payable under 31 U.S.C. 3721 or andSection;andSection;536.20 through 536.35 depending on the facts. (b)<T3> Property damage claims. </T3>A claim for damage to or loss of personalproperty of a claimant who is within one of the categories of proper partyclaimants under 31 U.S.C. 3721, which is otherwise cognizable under 31U.S.C. 3721, must first be considered thereunder. If a claim is not clearlycompensable under 31 U.S.C. 3721, and it arises incident to a noncombatactivity of the DA or was caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omissionof military personnel or civilian employees of the Department of Defense(DOD), it may be cognizable under either andSection;andSection; 536.20 through536.35 or andSection; 536.50. The claim, if meritorious in fact, will probablybe payable under one authorization or another regardless of whether theclaim accrued incident to the service of the claimant. (c)<T3> Personal injury and death claims. </T3>(1) Only after the death orpersonal injury (which is the subject of the claim) has been determinedto have not been incurred incident to the member's service should andSection;andSection;536.20 through 536.35 and andSection; 536.50 be studied to determine which,if either, provides a proper basis for settlement of the claim. In anyevent, the rule in <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Brooks, </T3>176 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1949) requiring setoff of amountsobtained through military or veterans' compensation systems against amountsotherwise recoverable will be followed. Other Government benefits, fundedby general treasury revenues and not by the claimant's contributions, mayalso be used as a setoff against the settlement. (See, <T3>Overton </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>619 F.2d 1299 (8th Cir. 1980)).(2) As the incident to service issue is determinative as to whether thistype of claim may be processed administratively at all, the applicablelaw and facts should be carefully considered before deciding that injuryor death was not incident to service. Such claims also are often difficultto settle on the issue of quantum and thus more likely to end in litigation.Moreover, the United States may well elect to defend the lawsuit on thebasis of the incident to service exclusion, and this defense could be prejudicedby a contrary administrative determination that a service member's personalinjuries or death were not incident to service. Doubtful cases will beforwarded to the Commander, USARCS without action along with sufficientfactual information to permit a determination of the incident to servicequestion. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Use of Appraisers and Independent Medical Examinations. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Appraisers. </T3>Appraisers should be used in all claims where an appraisalis reasonably necessary and useful in effectuating the administrative settlementof the claims. The decision to use an appraiser is at the discretion ofDA. (b) <T3>Independent medical examinations. </T3>In claims involving seriouspersonal injuries, for example, normally those cases in which there isan allegation of temporary or permanent disability, the claimant shouldbe examined by an independent physician, or other medical specialist, dependingupon the nature and extent of the injuries. The decision to conduct anindependent medical examination is at the discretion of DA. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Effect on Award of Other Payments to Claimant. </ITAG>The total award to which the claimant (and subrogee) may be entitled normallywill be computed as follows: (a) Determine the total of the loss or damage suffered. (b) Deduct from the total loss or damage suffered any payment, compensation,or benefit the claimant has received from the following sources: (1) The U.S. or ARNG employee/member who caused the damage. (2) The U.S. or ARNG employee's/member's insurer. (3) Any person or agency in a surety relationship with the U.S. employee;or (4) Any joint tortfeasor or insurer, to include Government contractorsunder contracts or in jurisdictions where it is permissible to obtain contributionor indemnity from the contractor in settlement of claims by contractoremployees and third parties. (5) Any advance payment made pursuant to andSection; 536.13. (6) Any benefit or compensation based directly or indirectly on an employer-employeerelationship with the United States or Government contractor and receivedat the expense of the United States including but not limited to medicalor hospital services, burial expenses, death gratuities, disability payment,or pensions. (7) The State (Commonwealth, etc.) whose employee or ARNG member causedor generated an incident that was a proximate cause of the resulting damages.(8) Value of Federal medical care. (9) Benefits paid by the Veterans Administration (VA) that are intendedto compensate the same elements of damage. When the claimant is receivingmoney benefits from the VA under 38 U.S.C. 351 for a non-service connecteddisability or death based on the injury that is the subject of the claim,acceptance of a settlement or an award under the FTCA (andSection; 536.50)will discontinue the VA monetary benefits until the amount that would haveotherwise been received in VA monetary benefits is equal to the total amountof the agreement or award including attorney fees. While monetary benefitsreceived under 38 U.S.C. 351 must be discontinued as above, medical benefits,that is, VA medical care may continue provided the settlement or awardexpressly provides for such continuance and the appropriate VA officialis informed of such continuance. (10) When the claimant is receiving money benefits under 38 U.S.C. 410(b)for non-service connected death, arising from the injury that is the subjectof the claim, acceptance of a settlement or award under the FTCA (andSection;536.50) or under any other tort procedure will discontinue the VA benefitsuntil the amount that would have otherwise been received in VA benefitsis equal to the amount of the total settlement or award including attorneyfees. The discontinuation of monetary benefits under 38 U.S.C. 410(b) hasno effect on the receipt of other VA benefits. The claimant should be informedof the foregoing prior to the conclusion of any settlement and thus affordedan opportunity to make appropriate adjustment in the amount being negotiated.(11) Value of other Federal benefits to which the claimant did not contribute,or at least to the extent they are funded from general revenue appropriation.(12) Collateral sources where permitted by State law (for example, Stateor Federal workers' compensation, social security, private health, accident,and disability benefits paid as a result of injuries caused by a healthcare provider).(c) No deduction will be made for any payment the claimant has receivedby way of voluntary contributions, such as donations of charitable organizations.(d) Where a payment has been made to the claimant by his insurer or othersubrogee, or under workmen's compensation insurance coverage, as to whichsubrogated interests are allowable, the award based on total damages willbe apportioned as their separate interests are indicated (see andSection;536.5(b)). (e) After deduction of permissible collateral and non-collateral sources,also deduct that portion of the loss or damage believed to have been causedby the negligence of the claimant, third parties whose negligence can beimputed to the claimant, or joint tortfeasors who are liable for theirshare of the negligence (for example, where some form of the Uniform ContributionAmong Joint Tortfeasors Act has been passed). (f) Claims with more than one potential source of recovery. (1) The Governmentseeks to avoid multiple recovery, that is, claimants seeking recovery frommore than one potential source, and to minimize the award it must make.The claims investigation should therefore identify other parties potentiallyliable to the claimant and/or their insurance carriers; indicate the statusof any claims made or include a statement that none has been made so thatit can be assured there is only one recovery and the Government does notpay a disproportionate share. Where no claim has been made by the claimantagainst others potentially liable, if applicable State law grants the Governmentthe right to indemnity or contribution, and it is felt the Government maybe entitled to either under the facts developed by the claims investigation,the claims officer or attorney should formally notify the other partiesof their potential liability, the Government's willingness to share information,and its expectation of shared responsibility for any settlement. Furthermore,the claimant may be receiving or entitled to receive benefits from collateraland non-collateral sources, which can be deducted from the total loss ordamage. Accordingly, a careful review must be made of applicable Statelaws regarding joint and several liability, indemnity, contribution, comparativenegligence, and the collateral source doctrine. (2) If a demand by a claimant or an inquiry by a potential claimant isdirected solely to the Army, in a situation where it appears that the responsibleArmy employee may have applicable insurance coverage, inquiry should bemade of the employee as to whether he has liability insurance. (i) If so, determine if the insurer has made or will make any payment toclaimant. Under applicable State law, the United States may be an additionalnamed insured entitled to coverage under the employee's liability policy.(See 16 ALR3d 1411; <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., </T3>245 F. Supp. 58 (D. Ore. 1965.)) Therefore,where there may be applicable insurance coverage, there should be a reviewof the policy language together with the rules and regulations of the Stateinsurance regulatory body to determine whether the United States comeswithin the definition of ``insured,'' and whether the exclusion of theUnited States from policy coverage conforms with state law and policy.(ii) If the employee refuses to cooperate in providing this information,he or she should be advised to comply with the notice requirements of theinsurance policy and to request the insurance carrier contact the claimsofficer or attorney. In addition, other sources of information, such asvehicle registration records, will be checked to ascertain the employee'sinsurer. The case should be followed to ascertain whether the employee'sinsurer has made or will make any payment to the claimant before decidingwhether to settle the claim against the Government. Normally, the award,if any, to the claimant will be reduced by the amount of the payment ofthe employee's insurance carrier. (3) If the employee is the sole target of the claim and Army claims authoritiesarrange to have the claim made against the Government, the member or employeeshould be required to notify his or her insurance carrier according tothe policy and inform DA claims authorities as to the details of the insurancecoverage, including the name of the insurance carrier. Except when the``Drivers Act'' is applicable, the insurance carrier is expected to participatein the negotiation of the claims settlement and to pay its fair share ofany award to the claimant. (4) Where the responsible Army employee is ``on loan'' to another employerother than the United States, for example, civilian institution for ROTCinstructor, or performing duties for a foreign government, inquiry shouldbe made to determine whether there is applicable statutory or insurancecoverage concerning the acts of the responsible employee and contributionor indemnification sought, as appropriate. In the case of foreign governments,applicable treaties or agreements are considered controlling. (5) A great many claims cognizable under the FTCA (andSection; 536.50) arenow settled on a compromise basis. A major consideration in many such settlementsis the identification of other sources of recovery. This is true in a varietyof factual situations where there is a potential joint tortfeasor; forexample, multi-vehicle accidents with multiple drivers and guest passengers,State or local government involvement, contractors performing non-routinetasks for the Government, medical treatment rendered to a claimant by non-Governmentemployees, or incidents caused by a member or employee of the militarydepartment of a State or Commonwealth with whom the DA does not have acost-sharing agreement. The law of the jurisdiction regarding joint andseveral liability, indemnity and contribution may permit shared financialresponsibility, but even in jurisdictions which do not permit contribution,a compromise settlement can often be reached with the other tortfeasor'sinsurance company paying a portion of the total amount of the claim againstthe Government. For these reasons, every effort should be made to identifythe insurance of all potential tortfeasors involved and the status of anyclaims made, and to demand contribution or indemnity where there is a substantialreason to believe that liability for the loss or damage should be shared.(6) Whenever a claim is filed against the Government under a statute whichdoes not permit the payment of a subrogated interest, it is important toensure that full information is obtained from the claimant regarding insurancecoverage, if any, since it is the clear legislative intent of such statutesthat insurance coverage be fully utilized before using appropriated fundsto pay the claims. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Settlement agreement. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Except under 31 U.S.C. 3721, if a claim is determinedto be meritorious in an amount less than claimed, or if a claim involvingpersonal injuries or death is approved in full, a settlement agreementwill be obtained prior to payment. Acceptance by a claimant of an awardconstitutes a full and final settlement and release of any and all claimsagainst the United States and against the military or civilian personnelwhose act or omission gave rise to the claim.(b) <T3>Claims involving workmen's compensation carriers. </T3>The settlementof a claim involving a claimant who has elected to receive workmen's compensationbenefits under local law may require the consent of the workmen's compensationcarrier and in certain jurisdictions the State agency with authority overworkmen's compensation awards.

(b) <T3>Final Actions under the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 2671-2680)andSection; 536.50. </T3>If the settlement authority has information availablewhich could possibly be a persuasive factor in the decision of the claimantas to whether to resort to litigation, such information may be orally transmittedto the claimant and, in appropriate cases, released under normal proceduresin accordance with AR 340-17. However, the written notification of thedenial should be general in nature; for example, denial on the weaker groundof contributory negligence should be avoided, and the inclination shouldbe to deny on the basis that the claimant was solely responsible for theincident. The claimant will be informed in writing of his right to bringan action in the appropriate United States District Court not later than6 months after the date of mailing of the notification. (c) <T3>Denials under the MCA (10 U.S.C. 2733) andSection;andSection; 536.20 through536.35 and the NGCA (32 U.S.C. 715) andSection;andSection; 536.70 through 536.81.</T3>Claims disapproved under these statutes are subject to appeal andthe claimant will be so informed. Also, the notice of disapproval willbe sufficiently detailed to provide the claimant with an opportunity toknow and attempt to overcome the basis for the disapproval. The claimantshould not be afforded a valid basis for claiming surprise when an issueadverse to him is asserted as a basis for denying his appeal. (d) <T3>Denials on jurisdictional grounds. </T3>Regardless of the nature ofthe claim presented or the statute under which it may be considered, claimsdenied on jurisdictional grounds which are valid, certain, and not easilyovercome and in which for this reason no detailed investigation as to themerits of the claim is conducted, should contain in the denial letter ageneral statement to the effect that the denial on such grounds is notto be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the claimor an admission of liability. If sufficient factual information is availableto make a tentative ruling on the merits of the claim, liability may beexpressly denied.

Claims cognizable under other claims statutesmay be processed under this section. (c) <T3>Effect of disciplinary action. </T3>Administrative action under Article139 and this section is entirely separate and distinct from disciplinaryaction taken under other articles of the UCMJ or other administrative actions.Because action under Article 139 and this section requires independentfindings on issues other than guilt or innocence, the mere fact that asoldier was convicted or acquitted of charges is not dispositive of a claimunder Article 139.

(2) <T3>Limitations on amount. </T3>No soldier's pay may be assessed more than$5,000 on a single claim without the approval of the Commander, USARCS,or designee. If the commander acting on the claim determines that an assessmentagainst a soldier in excess of $5,000 is meritorious, he or she will assessthe pay of that soldier in the amount of $5,000 and forward the claim tothe Commander, USARCS, with his or her recommendation as to the additionalamount which should be assessed. (3) <T3>Direct damages. </T3>Assessments are limited to direct damages forthe loss of or damage to property. Indirect, remote, or consequential damagesmay not be considered under this section. (g) <T3>Procedure. </T3>Area claims offices and claims processing offices withapproval authority are responsible for publicizing the Article 139 programand maintaining a log for Article 139 claims presented in their areas (seePersonnel Claims Adjudication appendix G, Claims Manual). Area claims officesand claims processing offices with approval authority are required to monitoraction taken on Article 139 claims and ensure that time requirements aremet. If assessment action on a particular claim will be unduly delayed,the office may consider the claim under 31 USC 3721 and chapter 11 of thisregulation if it is otherwise cognizable under the authority. The officewill counsel the claimant to repay any overpayment if the Article 139 claimis later successful (see para 11-2e).

If the claim is made against soldiersunder the jurisdiction of more than one such convening authority who areunder the same general court-martial convening authority, the claim willbe forwarded to that general court-martial convening authority, who willdesignate one SPCMCA to investigate and act on the claim as to all soldiersinvolved. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdictionof more than one SPCMCA at different locations and not under the same generalcourt-martial convening authority, the claim will be forwarded to the SPCMCAwhose headquarters is closest to the situs of the incident, who will investigateand act on the claim as to all soldiers involved. If a claim is made againsta member of one of the other military Services, the claim will be forwardedto the commander of the nearest major Army command (MACOM) of that Service.(3) <T3>Action by the SPCMCA. </T3>Within 4 working days of receipt of a claim,the SPCMCA will appoint an investigating officer to investigate the claim,using the procedures of this section supplemented by the procedures ofAR 15-6. The claims officer of a command, if he or she is a commissionedofficer, may be appointed as the investigating officer. (4) <T3>Action by the investigating officer. </T3>The investigating officerwill provide notification to the soldier against whom the claim is made.(i) If the soldier indicates a desire to make voluntary restitution, theinvestigating officer may, with the convening authority's concurrence,delay proceedings until the end of the next pay period to accomplish this.If the soldier makes payment to the claimant's full satisfaction, the claimwill be dismissed. (ii) In the absence of full restitution, the investigating officer willdetermine whether the claim is cognizable and meritorious under the provisionsof Article 139 and this chapter and the amount to be assessed each offender.This amount will be reduced by any restitution accepted by the claimantfrom an offender in partial satisfaction. Within 10 working days or suchtime as the SPCMCA may provide, the investigating officer will make findingsand recommendations and submit these to the SPCMCA. The investigating officerwill also provide a copy of his or her findings and recommendations toany soldier against whom an assessment is recommended. (iii) If the soldier is absent without leave so that he or she cannot beprovided with notification, the Article 139 claim may be processed in thesoldier's absence. If an assessment is approved, a copy of the claim andSPCMCA approval will be forwarded by transmittal letter to the servicingfinance and accounting office (FAO) for offset input against the soldier'spay account. In the event the soldier is dropped from the rolls, the servicingFAO will forward the assessment documents to Commander, U.S. Army Financeand Accounting Center, attn: Department 40, Indianapolis, Indiana 46249.(5) <T3>Legal review. </T3>After completion of the investigating officer'sreport, the SPCMCA will refer the claim to the area claims office or claimsprocessing office servicing his or her command to review for legal sufficiencyand advice. That office will furnish within 5 working days or such timeas the SPCMCA will provide a written opinion as to_ (i) Whether the claim is cognizable under the provisions of Article 139and this chapter. (ii) Whether the findings and recommendations are supported by evidence.(iii) Whether there has been substantial compliance with the proceduralrequirements of Article 139, this chapter, and AR 15-6. (6) <T3>Final action. </T3>After considering the advice of the claims office,the SPCMCA will disapprove the claim or approve the claim in an amountequal to or less than the amount recommended by the investigating officer.The SPCMCA will notify the claimant, and any soldier subject to his orher jurisdiction, of the determination and the right to request reconsideration.The SPCMCA will then suspend action on the claim for 10 working days pendingreceipt of a request for reconsideration unless he or she determines thatthis delay will result in substantial injustice. The SPCMCA will directthe servicing finance officer for the soldier or soldiers against whomassessments are approved to withhold such amount from the soldier or soldiersup to $5000. For any soldier not subject to the SPCMCA's jurisdiction,the SPCMCA will forward the claim to that commander who does exercise specialcourt-martial jurisdiction over the soldier for collection action. (7) <T3>Assessment. </T3>Subject to any limitations provided in appropriateregulations, the servicing finance officer will withhold the amount directedby the SPCMCA and pay it to the claimant. The SPCMCA's assessment is notsubject to appeal and is conclusive on any finance officer. If the servicingfinance officer finds that the required amount cannot be withheld becausehe or she does not have custody of the soldier's pay record or becausethe soldier is in a no pay due status, the servicing finance officer willpromptly notify the SPCMCA of this in writing. (8) <T3>Post settlement action. </T3>After action on the claim is completed,the claims office servicing the command which took final action will forwardone copy of the claim together with a cover sheet and all attachments,to include information that money has or has not been withheld and paidto the claimant by the servicing finance officer, through any command claimsservice, to the Commander, USARCS. (9) <T3>Remission of indebtedness. </T3>Title 10, United States Code, section4837(d), which authorizes the remission and cancellation of indebtednessof an enlisted person to the United States or its instrumentalities, isnot applicable and may not be used to remit and cancel indebtedness determinedas a result of action under Article 139. (h) <T3>Reconsideration_</T3>(1) <T3>General. </T3>Although Article 139 does not provide for a right ofappeal, either the claimant or a soldier whose pay is assessed may requestthe SPCMCA or a successor in command to reconsider the action. A requestfor reconsideration will be submitted in writing and will clearly statethe factual or legal basis for the relief requested. The SPCMCA may directthat the matter be reinvestigated. (2) <T3>Reconsideration by the original SPCMCA. </T3>The original SPCMCA mayreconsider the action so long as he occupies that position, regardlessof whether a soldier whose pay was assessed has been transferred. If theoriginal SPCMCA determines that the action was incorrect, he or she maymodify it subject to paragraph (h)(4) of this section. If a request forreconsideration is submitted more than 15 days after notification was provided,however, the SPCMCA should only modify the action on the basis of fraud,substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake of law. (3) <T3>Reconsideration by a successor in command. </T3>Subject to paragraph(h)(4) of this section, a successor in command may only modify an actionon the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculationor mistake of law apparent on the face of the record. (4) <T3>Legal review and action. </T3>Prior to modifying the original action,the SPCMCA will have the claims office render a legal opinion and fullyexplain his or her basis for modification as part of the file. If a returnof assessed pay is deemed appropriate, the SPCMCA should request the claimantto return the money, setting forth the basis for the request. There isno authority for repayment from appropriated funds. (5) <T3>Disposition of files. </T3>After completing action on reconsideration,the SPCMCA will forward a copy of the reconsideration action to the Commander,USARCS, and retain one or more additional copies with the claim file. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.50 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Claims based on negligence of military personnel or civilian employeesunder the Federal Tort Claims Act. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Authority. </T3>The statutory authority for this chapter is the FTCA(60 Stat. 842, 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680), as amended by the Act of 18 July 1966(Pub. L. 89-506; 80 Stat. 306), the Act of 16 March 1974 (Pub. L. 93-253;88 Stat. 50), and the Act of 29 December 1981 (Pub. L. 97-124), and asimplemented by the Attorney General's Regulations (28 CFR 14.1-14.11).(b) <T3>Scope. </T3>This section prescribes the substantive basis and specialprocedural requirements for the administrative settlement of claims againstthe United States under the FTCA and the implementing Attorney General'sRegulations based on death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of propertywhich accrue on or after 18 January 1967. If a conflict exists betweenthe provisions of this section and the provisions of the Attorney General'sRegulations, the latter govern. (c) <T3>Claims payable. </T3>Unless otherwise prescribed, claims for death,personal injury, or damage to or loss of property (real or personal) arepayable under this section when the injury or damage is caused by negligentor wrongful acts or omissions of military personnel or civilian employeesof the DA or the DoD while acting within the scope of their employmentunder circumstances in which the United States, if a private person, wouldbe liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place wherethe act or omission occurred. The FTCA is a limited consent to liabilitywithout which the United States is immune. Similarly, there is no Federalcause of action created by the Constitution which would permit a damagerecovery because of the Fifth Amendment or any other constitutional provision.Immunity must be expressly waived, as by the FTCA. (d) ``Employee of the Government'' (28 U.S.C. 2671) includes the followingcategories of tortfeasors for which the DA is responsible: (1) Military personnel (members of the Army), including but not limitedto: (i) Members on full-time active duty in a pay status, including_ (A) Members assigned to units performing active service. (B) Members serving as ROTC instructors. (Does not include Junior ROTCinstructors unless on active duty.) (C) Members serving as National Guard instructors or advisors. (D) Members on duty or in training with other Federal agencies, for example,Nuclear Regulatory Commission, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Departments of Defense, State, Navy, or Air Force. (E) Members assigned as students or ordered into training at a non-Federalcivilian educational institution, hospital, factory, or other industry.This does not include members on excess leave. (F) Members on full-time duty at nonappropriated fund activities. (G) Members of the ARNG of the United States on active duty. (ii) Members of reserve units during periods of inactive duty trainingand active duty training, including ROTC cadets who are reservists whilethey are at summer camp. (iii) Members of the ARNG while engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C.316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 for claims arising on or after 29 December 1981. (2) Civilian officials and employees of both the DOD and the DA (thereis no practical significance to the distinction between the terms ``official''and ``employee'') including but not limited to_(i) Civil Service and other full-time employees of both DOD and DA paidfrom appropriated funds. (ii) Contract surgeons (10 U.S.C. 1091, 4022) and consultants (10 U.S.C.1091) where ``control'' is exercised over physician's day to day practice.(iii) Employees of nonappropriated funds if the particular fund is an instrumentalityof the United States and thus a Federal agency. In determining whetheror not a particular fund is a ``Federal agency,'' consider whether thefund is an integral part of the DA charged with an essential DA operationalfunction and the degree of control and supervision exercised by DA personnel.Members or users, as distinguished from employees of nonappropriated funds,are not considered Government employees. The same is true of family childcare providers. However, claims arising out of the use of certain nonappropriatedfund property or the acts or omissions of family child care providers,may be payable from such funds under chapter 12, AR 27-20, as a matterof policy, even when the user is not within the scope of employment andthe claim is not otherwise cognizable under any other claims authorization.(iv) Prisoners of war and interned enemy aliens. (v) Civilian employees of the District of Columbia National Guard, includingthose paid under ``service contracts'' from District of Columbia funds.(vi) Civilians serving as ROTC instructors paid from Federal funds. (vii) National Guard technicians employed under 32 U.S.C. 709(a) for claimsaccruing on or after 1 January 1969 (Pub. L. 90-486, 13 August 1968; 82Stat. 755). (3) Persons acting in an official capacity for the DOD or the DA whethertemporarily or permanently in the service of the United States with orwithout compensation including but not limited to_(i) ``Dollar a year'' personnel. (ii) Members of advisory committees, commissions, boards or the like. (iii) Volunteer workers in an official capacity acting in furtherance ofthe business of the United States. The general rule with respect to volunteersis set forth in 31 U.S.C. 665(b), which provides that, ``No officer oremployee of the United States shall accept voluntary service for the UnitedStates or employ personal service in excess of that authorized by law,except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or theprotection of property.'' (5 U.S.C. 3111(c) specifically provides thatstudent volunteers employed thereunder shall be considered Federal employeesfor purposes of claims under the FTCA. The same classification is appliedby 10 U.S.C. 1588 to museum and family support program volunteers.) TheDA is permitted to accept and use certain volunteer services in Army familysupport programs. (10 U.S.C. 1588). (iv) Loaned servants. Employees who are permitted to serve another employermay be considered ``loaned servants,'' provided the borrowing employerhas the power to discharge the employee, to control and direct the employee,and to decide how he will perform his tasks. Whoever has retained thosepowers is liable for the employee's torts under the principle of respondeatsuperior. Where those elements of direction and control have been found,the United States has been liable, for example, for the torts of Governmentemployees loaned for medical training and emergency assistance, and countyand state employees discharging Federal programs. (e) ``Scope of employment'' means acting in ``line of [military] duty''(28 U.S.C. 2671) and is determined in accordance with principles of respondeatsuperior under the law of the jurisdiction in which the act or omissionoccurred. Determination as to whether a person is within a category listedin paragraph (d)(3) of this section will usually be made together withthe scope determination. Local law should always be researched, but thenovel aspects of the military relationship should be kept in mind in makinga scope determination. (f) ``Line of duty'' determinations under AR 600-8-1 are not determinativeof scope of employment. ``Joint venture'' situations are likely to be frequentwhere the Federal employee is performing federally assigned duties butis under actual direction and control of a non-Federal entity, for example,a Federal employee in training at a non-Federal entity or ROTC instructorsat civilian institutions. This could also occur where the employee is workingfor another Federal agency. Furthermore, dual purpose situations are commonplacewhere benefits to the Government and the member or employee may or maynot be concurrent, for example, use of privately owned vehicles at or awayfrom assigned duty station, or permanent change of station with delay enroute. (See andSection;andSection; 536.90 through 536.97 for the handling ofcertain claims arising out of nonscope activities of members of the Army.)(g)<T3> Law applicable.</T3> The whole law of the place where the act or omissionoccurred, including choice of law rules, will be applied in the determinationof liability and quantum. Where there is a conflict between the local lawand an express provision of the FTCA, the latter governs. (h)<T3> Subrogation.</T3> Claims involving subrogation will be processed asprescribed in andSection; 536.5(b), except where inconsistent with the provisionsof this section or the Attorney General's regulations. (i)<T3> Indemnity or contribution_</T3> (1)<T3> Sought by the United States.</T3> If the claim arises under circumstancesin which the Government is entitled to contribution or indemnity undera contract of insurance or the applicable law governing joint tortfeasors,the third party will be notified of the claim, and will be requested tohonor its obligation to the United States or to accept its share of jointliability. If the issue of indemnity or contribution is not satisfactorilyadjusted, the claim will be compromised or settled only after consultationwith the Department of Justice as provided in 28 CFR 14.6. (2)<T3> Claims for indemnity or contribution.</T3> Claims for indemnity orcontribution from the United States will be compromised or settled underthis section, if liability exists under the applicable law, provided theincident giving rise to such claim is otherwise cognizable under this section.As to such claims where the exclusivity of the FECA may be applicable,see 5 U.S.C. 8101-8150. (3)<T3> ARNG vehicular claims.</T3> When a vehicle used by the ARNG, or aprivately owned vehicle operated by a member or employee of the ARNG, isinvolved in an incident under circumstances which make this section applicableto the disposition of administrative claims against the United States andresults in personal injury, death, or property damage, and a remedy againstthe State or its insurer is indicated, the responsible area claims authoritywill monitor the action against the State or its insurer and encouragedirect settlement between the claimant and the State or its insurer. Wherethe State is insured, direct contact with State or ARNG officials ratherthan the insurer is desirable. Regular procedures will be established andfollowed wherever possible. Such procedures should be agreed on by bothlocal authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject to concurrenceby Commander, USARCS. Such procedures will be designed to ensure that localauthorities and United States authorities do not issue conflicting instructionsfor processing claims and that whenever possible and in accordance withgoverning local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement for disposition ofsuch claims as in paragraph (i)(4) of this section is worked out. Amountsrecovered or recoverable by claimant from any insurer (other than claimant'sinsurer who has obtained no subrogated interest against the United States)will be deducted from the amount otherwise payable. (4)<T3> Claims arising out of training activities of ARNG personnel.</T3>Contribution may be sought from the state involved where it has waivedsovereign immunity or has private insurance which would cover the incidentgiving rise to the particular claim. Where the state involved rejects therequest for contribution, the file will be forwarded to the Commander,USARCS. The Commander, USARCS, is authorized to enter into an agreementwith a State, territory, or commonwealth to share settlement costs of claimsgenerated by the ARNG personnel or activities of that political entity.(j)<T3> Claims not payable.</T3> The exclusions contained in 28 U.S.C. 2680are applicable to claims herein. Other types of claims are excluded bystatute or court decisions, including, but not limited to, the following:(1) Claims for the personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forcesof the United States incurred incident to service, or for damage to a member'sproperty incurred incident to service. <T3>Feres </T3>v. <T3>United States,</T3> 340 U.S. 135 (1950). Currently the most significantjustification for the incident to service doctrine is the availabilityof alternative compensation systems, and the fear of disrupting the militarycommand relationship. Other supportive factors often cited by the courtsare the service member's duty status, location, and receipt of militarybenefits at the time of the incident. (i) The exception applies to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, MarineCorps, and Coast Guard, including the Reserve Components of the Armed Forces.(See 10 U.S.C. 261.) The exception also applies to service members on theTemporary Disability Retired List, and on convalescent leave, to serviceacademy cadets, to members of visiting forces in the United States underthe SOFA between the parties to the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationor similar international agreements, and to service members on the extendedenlistment program. (ii) The incident to service doctrine has been extended to derivative claimswhere the directly injured party is a service member. Third party indemnityclaims are barred. (2) Claims for the personal injury or death of a Government employee forwhom benefits are provided by the Federal Employees Compensation Act (5U.S.C. 8101-8150). Who is a government employee under the Act is definedin the Act itself (5 U.S.C. 8101), but is not limited to Federal CivilService employees. The term ``government employee'' can include certainROTC cadets (5 U.S.C. 8140) and state or local law enforcement officersengaged in apprehending a person for committing a crime against the UnitedStates (5 U.S.C. 8191), certain nurses, interns or other health care personnel,e.g., student nurses, etc. (5 U.S.C. 5351, 8144) and certain Army CommunityService Volunteers (10 U.S.C. 1588). This Act provides that benefits paidunder the Act are exclusive and instead of all other liability of the UnitedStates, including that under a Federal tort liability statute (5 U.S.C.8116(c)). It extends to derivative claims, to subsequent malpractice fortreatment of a covered injury, to injuries for which there is no scheduledcompensation, and to employee harassment claims for which other remediesare available (42 U.S.C. 2000e). The exception does not bar third partyindemnity claims. When there is doubt as to whether or not this exceptionapplies, the claim should be forwarded through claims channels to the Commander,USARCS, for an opinion. (3) Claims for the personal injury or death of an employee, including nonappropriatedfund employees, for whom benefits are provided by the Longshoremen's andHarbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 901-950). An employee of anonappropriated fund instrumentality is covered by that Act (5 U.S.C. 8171).This is the exclusive remedy for covered employees, similar to the exclusivityof the FECA. (4) Claims for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefitsare provided under any workmen's compensation law, if the premiums of theworkmen's compensation insurance are retrospectively rated and chargedas an allowable, allocable expense to a cost-type contract. If, in theopinion of an approval or settlement authority, the claim should be consideredpayable, for example, the injuries did not result from a normal risk ofemployment or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensationlaws, the file will be forwarded with recommendations through claims channelsto the Commander, USARCS, who may authorize payment of an appropriate award.(5) Claims for damage from or by flood or flood waters at any place. 33U.S.C. 702c. This exception is broadly construed and includes multi-purposeprojects and all phases of construction and operation. (6) Claims based solely upon a theory of absolute liability or liabilitywithout fault. Either a ``negligent'' or ``wrongful'' act is required bythe FTCA, and some type of malfeasance or nonfeasance is required. <T3>Dalehite </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>346 U.S. 15 (1953); <T3>Laird </T3>v. <T3>Nelms, </T3>406 U.S. 797 (1972). Thus, liability does not arise byvirtue either of United States ownership of an inherently dangerous commodityor of engaging in extra-hazardous activity. (k)<T3> Procedures</T3>_(1)<T3> General. </T3>Unless inconsistent with the provisions of this section,the procedures for the investigation and processing of claims set forthin andSection;andSection; 536.1 through 536.13 will be followed. (2)<T3> Claims arising out of tortious conduct by ARNG personnel as definedin paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section</T3>_(i)<T3> Notification. </T3>The procedures prescribed in andSection; 536.75,will be followed in ARNG claims arising under the FTCA. (ii) Claims against the U.S. Government received by agencies of the State.These claims will be expeditiously forwarded through the State adjutantgeneral to the appropriate U.S. Army area claims office in whose geographicarea the incident occurred. (3)<T3> Statute of Limitations. </T3>(i) To be settled under this section,a claim against the United States must be presented in writing to the appropriateFederal agency within 2 years of its accrual. (ii) For statute of limitations purposes, a claim will be deemed to havebeen presented when the appropriate Federal agency as defined in andSection;536.3(m) receives from a claimant, his or her duly authorized agent, orlegal representative an executed SF 95 or written notification of an incident,together with a claim for money damages, in a sum certain, for damage toor loss of property or personal injury or death. For Federal tort claimsarising out of activities of the ARNG, receipt of a written claim by anyfulltime officer or employee of the ARNG will be considered proper receipt.(iii) A claim received by an official of the DOD will be transmitted withoutdelay to the nearest Army claims processing office or area claims office.Inquiries concerning applicability of the statute of limitations to claimsfiled with the wrong Federal agency will be referred to USARCS for resolution.(4)<T3> Claims within settlement authority of USARCS or the Attorney General.</T3>A copy of each claim which must be brought to the attention of the AttorneyGeneral in accordance with his or her regulations (28 CFR 14.6), or onein which the demand exceeds $15,000 or the total amount of all claims,actual or potential, from a single incident exceeds $25,000, will be forwardedimmediately to the Commander, USARCS. Subsequent documents should be forwardedor added in accordance with andSection; 536.5(h)(2). USARCS is responsiblefor the monitoring and settlement of such claims and will be kept informedof the status of the investigation and processing thereof. Direct liaisonand correspondence between USARCS and the field claims authority or investigatoris authorized on all claims matters, and assistance will be furnished asrequired. (5)<T3> Non-Army claims. </T3>Claims based on acts or omissions of employeesof the United States, other than military and civilian personnel of theDA, civilian personnel of the DOD, and employees of nonappropriated fundactivities of the DA, will be transmitted forthwith to the nearest officialof the employing agency, and the claimant will be advised of the referral.(6)<T3> Acknowledgment of claim. </T3>(i) The claimant and his or her attorneywill be kept informed by personal contact, telephonic contact, or mailof the receipt of his or her claim and the status of the claim. Formalacknowledgment of the claim in writing is required only where the claimis likely to result in litigation or is presented in an amount exceeding$15,000. In this event, the letter of acknowledgment will state the dateof receipt of the claim by the first agency of the Army receiving the claim.(ii) If it is reasonably clear to the office acknowledging receipt thata claim filed under the FTCA is not cognizable thereunder; for example,it is a maritime claim under andSection; 536.60, or it falls under andSection;andSection;536.20 through 536.35 or 536.70 through 536.81, the acknowledgment willcontain a statement advising the claimant of the statute under which hisor her claim will be processed. If it is not clear which statute applies,a statement to that effect will be made, and the claimant will be promptlyadvised on his or her remedy when a decision is made. However, all potentialmaritime claims will be handled in accordance with andSection; 536.5(h)(5).(iii ) When a claim has been amended as set forth in andSection; 536.5(f)(4),the amendment will be acknowledged in all cases. Additionally, the claimantwill be informed that the amendment constitutes a new claim insofar asconcerns the 6 months in which the DA is granted the authority to makea final disposition under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) and the claimant's option thereunderwill not accrue until 6 months after the filing of the amendment. (iv) When a claim is improperly presented, is incomplete or otherwise doesnot meet the requirements set forth in andSection; 536.5(d), the claimantor his or her representative will be promptly informed in writing of thedeficiencies and advised that a proper claim must be filed within the 2year statute of limitations. (7) <T3>Investigation. </T3>Claims cognizable under this section will be investigatedand processed on a priority basis in order that settlement if indicatedmay be accomplished within the 6 months prescribed by statute. (8) <T3>Advice to claimant. </T3>(i) A full explanation of claims proceduresand of the rights of the claimant will be made to the extent necessitatedby the amount and nature of the claim. (ii) In a case where litigation is likely, or where this course of actionis preferred by the claimant, and it appears to be a proper case for administrativesettlement, the claimant will be advised as to the advantages of administrativesettlement. If the claim is within the jurisdiction of a higher settlementauthority, the claim will be discussed with such authority prior to thefurnishing of such advice. The claimant should be familiarized with allaspects of administrative settlement procedures including the administrativechannels through which his claim must be processed for approval. He orshe may be advised that administrative processing can result in more expeditiousprocessing, whereas litigation may take considerable time, particularlyin jurisdictions with crowded dockets. (iii) If appropriate, he or she may be informed that a tentative settlementcan be reached for any amount above $25,000, subject to approval by theAttorney General. He or she should be advised that administrative filingof the claim protects him under the statute of limitations for purposeof litigation; suit can be filed within 6 months after the date of mailingof notice of final denial by the DA, thus potentially allowing negotiationsto continue indefinitely. An attorney representing a claimant should beadvised of the limitations on fees for purposes of administrative settlement(20 percent) and litigation (25 percent). The attorney may also be advisedthat there is no jury trial under the FTCA. (9) <T3>Notification to claimant of action on claim. </T3>(i) The filing ofan administrative claim and its denial are prerequisite to filing suit.Any suit must be filed not later than 6 months after notification by certifiedor registered mail of the denial of the administrative claim. Failure ofa settlement authority to take final action on a properly filed claim within6 months may be treated by the claimant as a final denial for the purposesof filing suit. If the claimant has provided insufficient documentationto permit evaluation of the claim, written notice should be given to thiseffect. Since administrative settlements are a voluntary process, the preferredmethod of negotiating is to attempt to exchange information on an openbasis. (ii) Upon final denial of a claim, or upon rejection by the claimant ofa partial allowance, and further efforts to reach a settlement are notconsidered feasible (andSection; 536.5(h)(1)), the settlement authority willinform the claimant of the action on his claim by certified or registeredmail. Notification will be made as set forth in andSection; 536.11(b).  (iii) If a claim has been presented to the DA and, also, to other Federalagencies, without any notification to the DA of this fact, final actiontaken by the DA prior to that of any other agency is conclusive on a claimpresented to other agencies, unless another agency decides to take furtheraction to settle the claim. Such agency may treat the matter as a reconsiderationunder 28 CFR 14.9(b), unless suit has been filed. The foregoing applieslikewise to DA claims in which another Federal Agency has already takenfinal action. (iv) If, after final denial by another agency, a claim is filed with theDA, the new submission will not toll the 6 months limitation for filingsuit, unless the DA treats the second submission as a request for reconsiderationunder paragraph (k)(9)(iv)(A) of this section. (A) <T3>Reconsideration.</T3> (<T3>1</T3>) While there is no appeal from the action of  an approving orsettlement authority under the FTCA and this section, an approving or settlementauthority may reconsider a claim upon request of the claimant or someoneacting in his behalf. Even in the absence of such a request, an approvingor settlement authority may on his own initiative reconsider a claim. Hemay reconsider a claim which he previously disapproved in whole or in part(even where a settlement agreement has been executed) when it appears thathis original action was incorrect in law or fact based on the evidenceof record at the time of the action or subsequently received. If he determinesthat his original action was incorrect, he will modify the action and,if appropriate, make a supplemental payment. The basis for a change inaction will be stated in a memorandum included in the file. (<T3>2</T3>) A successor approving or settlement authority may also reconsiderthe original action on a claim but only on the basis of fraud, substantialnew evidence, errors in calculation or mistake (misinterpretation) of law.(<T3>3</T3>) A request for reconsideration must be submitted prior to thecommencement of suit and prior to the expiration of the 6-month periodprovided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Upon timely filing, the appropriate authorityshall have 6 months from the date of filing in which to make a final dispositionof the request, and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) shallnot accrue until 6 months after the filing of the request. (<T3>4</T3>) A request for reconsideration should indicate fully the legalor factual basis asserted as grounds for relief. Following completion ofany investigation or other action deemed necessary for an informed dispositionof the request, the approving or settlement authority will reconsider theclaim and attempt to settle it by granting such relief as may appear warranted.When further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the entire file witha memorandum of opinion will be referred through claims channels to theCommander, USARCS, and the claimant informed of such referral. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.60 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Maritime claims. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Statutory authority. </T3>Administrative settlement or compromise ofadmiralty and maritime claims in favor of and against the United Statesby the Secretary of the Army or his designee is authorized by the ArmyMaritime Claims Settlement Act (10 U.S.C. 4801-04, 4806, as amended). (b) <T3>Related statutes. </T3>The Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act is supplementedby the following statutes under which suits in admiralty may be brought:the Suits in Admiralty Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 525, 46 U.S.C. 741-752); thePublic Vessels Act of 1925 (43 Stat. 1112, 46 U.S.C. 781-790); the Actof 1948 Extending the Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction (62 Stat. 496,46 U.S.C. 740). Similar maritime claims settlement authority is exercisedby the Department of the Navy under 10 U.S.C. 7365, 7621-23 and by theDepartment of the Air Force under 10 U.S.C. 9801-9804, 9806.

(2) Claims which are within the scope of this section and also within thescope of the FCA (10 U.S.C. 2734) may be processed under that statute whenspecific authority to do so has been obtained from the Commander, USARCS.The request for such authority should be accompanied by a copy of the reportof the incident by the Marine Casualty Investigating Officer, or otherclaims investigator. (g)<T3> Subrogation.</T3> (1) An assurer will be recognized as a claimantunder this section to the extent that it has become subrogated by paymentto, or on behalf of, its assured, pursuant to a contract of insurance inforce at the time of the incident from which the claim arose. An assurerand its assured may file a claim either jointly or separately. Joint claimsmust be asserted in the names of, and must be signed by, or on behalf of,all parties; payment then will be made jointly. If separate claims arefiled, payment to each party will be limited to the extent of such party'sundisputed interest. (2) For the purpose of determining authority to settle or compromise aclaim, the payable interests of an assurer (or assurers) and the assuredrepresent merely separable interests, which interests in the aggregatemust not exceed the amount authorized for administrative settlement orcompromise. (3) The policies set forth in paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this sectionwith respect to subrogation arising from insurance contracts are applicableto all other types of subrogation.

Regular procedures will be establishedand followed wherever possible. Such procedures should be agreed on byboth local authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject toconcurrence by the Commander, USARCS. Such procedures will be designedto ensure that local authorities and U.S. authorities do not issue conflictinginstructions for processing claims, and whenever possible and in accordancewith governing local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement for dispositionof such claims as in paragraph (c) of this section is worked out. Amountsrecovered or recoverable by claimant from any insurer (other than claimant'sinsurer who has obtained no subrogated interest against the United States)will be deducted from the amount otherwise payable. (b) If there is a remedy against the State or its insurer, the claimantmay be advised of that remedy. If the payment by the State or its insurerdoes not fully compensate claimant, an additional payment may be made underandSection;andSection; 536.70 through 536.81. If liability is clear and claimantsettles with the State or its insurer for less than the maximum amountrecoverable, the difference between the maximum amount recoverable fromthe State or its insurer and the settlement normally will be also deductedfrom the payment by the United States. (c) If the State or its insurer desires to pay less than their maximumjurisdiction or policy limit on a basis of 50 percent or more of the actualvalue of the entire claim, any payment made by the United States must bemade directly to the claimant. This can be accomplished by either havingthe United States pay the entire claim and have the State or its insurerreimburse its portion to the United States, or by having each party payits agreed share directly to the claimant. If the State or its insurerdesires to pay less than 50 percent of the actual value of the claim, theprocedure set forth in paragraph (d) of this section will be followed.(d) If there is a remedy against the State and the State refuses to makepayment, or there is insurance coverage and the claimant has filed an administrativeclaim against the United States, forward file with a memorandum of opinionto the Commander, USARCS, including information as to the status of anyjudicial or administrative action the claimant has taken against the Stateor its insurer. The Commander, USARCS, will determine whether the claimantwill be required to exhaust his remedy against the State or its insurer,or whether the claim against the United States can be settled without suchrequirement. If the Commander, USARCS, determines to follow the lattercourse of action, he will also determine whether an assignment of the claimagainst the State or its insurer will be obtained and whether recoveryaction will be taken. The State or its insurer will be given appropriatenotification in accordance with State law necessary to obtain contributionof indemnification. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 536.77 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Claims against the ARNG tortfeasor individually. </ITAG>The procedures set forth in andSection; 536.9(f) are applicable.
