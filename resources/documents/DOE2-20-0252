In some countries, including the United States, Canadaand Sweden, the spent fuel management is planned to be based on the directdisposal. Except for reprocessing little services for spent fuel managementare made available to foreign power companies. The main option in TVO'slong-range programme for spent fuel management is based on direct disposalin the Finnish bedrock. The reposiory site will be selected in the year2000 and the final disposal is scheduled to begin in 2020. At the sametime, TVO continues monitoring the international market for related servicesand will individually assess their suitability to TVO's spent fuel management.A serious alternative for a domestic direct disposal would be that ofsending the spent fuel out of Finland either for reprocessing or finaldisposal without a duty to take back any waste. For such a concept, itwould be essential to cover the overall quantity of TVO's spent fueland also to be competetive in financial terms. At the moment, there isnone such foreign service available. Regarding the domestic scheme fordirect disposal the R and D work will for some years be focused on theencapsulating process and canister materials, as well as the alternativerepository concepts.</TEXT></DOC>
