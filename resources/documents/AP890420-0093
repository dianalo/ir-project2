Mr. President, what are you going to do about the fact thatsensitive and relevant documents were not reviewed by theIran-Contra committee?   A. In the first place, I have great confidence that A.B.Culvahouse and those charged with cooperating with Congress werecooperative.   I've seen nothing to indicate they weren't.   Secondly, I would offer full cooperation for any requests madeof this administration.   And I just can't confirm the hypothesis of your question at all.   Q. But you mean, you would turn over any documents that they nowwant to see? Is that what you're saying?   A. Well, procedures were set up to determine what documentswould be made available.

Well, there have been suggestions that on the documents thatthere might have been an oversight either on the part of the FBI,the part of the White House staff. As far as you can tell, wasthere an oversight by any of those two bodies, or _   A. Not that I know of, Norm.   Q. _ was it just a question of Congress is not pushing the rightbuttons to get _   A. Well, I'm not sure.   I don't know.   All I can just state is the confidence that I feel in Culvahouseand company.   But we've received the letter down here, and I will a take thisopportunity to tell them, we'll cooperate fully.   But who controls the documents and all of that, you'll have totalk to the lawyers about that.   Q. Mr. President _   Q. Mr. President, when you _   A.
