MIAMI (AP) _ A federal judge Monday took under advisement amotion by two unions to dismiss a lawsuit in which Texas Air Corp.and its subsidiary Eastern Airlines ask damages of $2.5 billion.   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said he is inclined todismiss complaints against 38 officers and directors in the twounions. The complaints are part of the suit.   ``This is subject to whatever else I might decide in this case,''Hoeveler said.   The suit by Eastern and Texas Air was filed in May 1988 under acivil racketeering (RICO) statute, alleging mail and wire fraud andextortion under the federal Hobbs Act against the Air Line PilotsAssociation and the International Association of Machinists District100 AFL-CIO.   The suit charges RICO and RICO conspiracy ``through a pattern ofcriminal activities and defamation of Eastern Airlines and TexasAir.''   During three hours of argument before Hoeveler, attorneys for theunions attacked the suit at two levels.   Joseph Guerrieri Jr. of Washington, D.C., an attorney for themachinists, told Hoeveler the suit should have been filed as acounterclaim to a suit filed in 1987 in Washington by the unionsagainst the airlines.   That suit, now before U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker inthe District of Columbia, alleged that Texas Air was dismantlingEastern to destroy its unions.   Parker C. Folse III of Houston, representing Texas Air, respondedthat the issue before the District of Columbia court is ``entirelydifferent from the issue before this court.'' Folse added that``access to documents and witnesses is much more convenient in thisdistrict.''   But most of the argument came concerning the issues advanced inthe suit charging the unions with violation of the Racketeering Act.   Representing the Air Line Pilots Association, attorney Jed Rakoffof New York said the Miami suit, if successful, ``would set backlabor law by a century. It would hold that legitimate union activityconstituted a crime.''   Richard Ruda, an attorney for the machinists, said the case``involves a classic labor dispute.'' He said the suit was filed``just to keep the unions in line. ... It is a blatant misuse of theRICO act.''   Representing the Air Line Pilots Association, Thomasina Williamssaid the acts charged against the union were ``all protected andwere not extortionate conduct.''   In answer to the individual arguments, Folse, representing TexasAir and Eastern, said ``the complaint is supported by variousactivities by the union.'' But, he said, the labor attorneys confuselegal issues with social and political issues.   At another point, Folse said, ``They were furious at Texas Airacquiring EAL. ... They wanted to acquire it. ... They told EAL, `Wewant to own your route, your passengers. If you don't (sell) it tous, we're going to run you into the ground.'''   David Ross, a Miami attorney also representing Texas Air, saidsome of the statements made by union employees attacking Eastern'ssafety procedures are actionable under law.   The suit claims compensatory damages of $500 million and asksthat the amount be tripled under the Racketeering Act. The suit alsoasks $1 billion in punitive damages.</TEXT></DOC>
