Prosecutors have told lawyers for Milken and others theirclients could be indicted this week, before civil fraud chargesagainst the investment firm are settled, the sources said Tuesday,speaking on condition of anonymity.   The long-awaited criminal indictment of the high-yield, or``junk,'' bond wizard would mark a major change of the government'sstrategy in its more than two-year investigation of the Wall Streetgiant.   Defense attorneys had expected the indictment to follow asettlement between Drexel and the Securities and ExchangeCommission of civil fraud charges, including insider trading,brought last year. The complaint names Drexel; Milken; his brother,Lowell; two other Drexel employees; and industrialist Victor Posnerand his son, Steven.   But with negotiations stalled, Drexel balking atgovernment-ordered sanctions and the Milkens mounting legalchallenges to the firm's proposed settlement, the Manhattan U.S.attorney's office reportedly has decided to proceed with the case.   Sources close to the situation said lawyers were told that theMilkens and at least two other Drexel employees would be indictedthis week. The sources cautioned that prosecutors had made similarstatements in the past about pending indictments that nevermaterialized.   ``A number of the attorneys have been told that it's going to bethis week,'' said an attorney for one of the targets.   The sources said the government continues to call witnessesbefore a federal grand jury investigating Drexel's activities.   Milken last year received a target letter from the governmentindicating he would be indicted. The charges are expected toparallel the 184-page SEC complaint, which detailed 21 allegedfraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986.   Many of the charges detail alleged wrongdoing between Milken andIvan Boesky, the now-jailed financier who paid $100 million tosettle insider trading charges and tipped off prosecutors to otheralleged fraud deals.   The SEC settlement is a crucial pre-condition to a criminal pleabargain in which Drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies and paythe government $650 million. Drexel agreed to the pact in Decemberto avoid racketeering charges that could have crippled the firm.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, who heads the office'ssecurities fraud division, declined to comment on the Milken case.Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the company would not discussnegotiations in progress. A public relations firm hired by Milkendeclined to comment.   Once Milken is indicted, the government would have 70 days tobring its case to trial unless a judge grants a delay or attorneysfile motions further stalling the case.   One attorney said the government has indicated it would bring asecond wave of superceding indictments, contending that a first setof charges would be used as a pressure tactic to induce Milken andother defendants and witnesses to negotiate.   An indictment also would shift focus from the SEC negotiations,in which Drexel has accused the government of requesting unfairlystringent measures against the firm and Milken.   Negotiations reportedly stalled earlier this month when DrexelChief Executive Frederick H. Joseph balked at a government demandto fire Milken before the settlement is completed.   Drexel already has agreed to fire Milken and withhold hismultimillion-dollar 1988 pay as part of the criminal settlement.Milken is challenging the provision in U.S. District Court inManhattan, saying it violates his rights.</TEXT></DOC>
