It's not the first time the characters from ``Gone With TheWind'' have appeared outside of the printed page or silver screen,and most U.S. fans of the Old South epic probably will never see abottle of ``Gone With The Wind'' wine.   The new line of wines is to be sold only in Japan, under alicense granted by the owners of the movie, Atlanta-based TurnerBroadcasting System Inc., to the Japanese media conglomerateFujisankei Communications International Inc.   Still, some people in the land of cotton wish this wine wouldsoon be forgotten.   ``Don't you think it cheapens the book and the movie?'' askedHal Clarke, the lawyer for ``Gone With The Wind'' author MargaretMitchell's estate.   For Fujisankei officials, the wine represents a chance to cashin on Japan's love of American popular culture and the nation'sever-increasing affection for wine.   Katherine Melchior Ray, senior account manager with Fujisankei,said the ``Gone With the Wind'' tie-in was a natural.   ``We're always looking for high-quality, unusual Americanproducts to sell in Japan,'' she said Monday. ``We see a demand inJapan for more beers and wine. With the interest in fine wines andbeer and interest in all American media, we figured why not put thetwo together?''   The line of California wines was to be unveiled today at areception at New York's 21 Club. The wine label features thefamiliar ``Gone With the Wind'' movie poster, with stars ClarkGable and Vivien Leigh embracing against a backdrop of Atlantaburning.   Ms. Ray said TBS officials initially were reluctant to slap``Gone With the Wind'' labels on wine bottles. TBS agreed, shesaid, because ``we took a lot of care to show this was going tomaintain the prestige of the movie and encourage the beauty of thescenes in `Gone With The Wind.'''   TBS receives ``several calls a month'' from people wanting touse ``Gone With the Wind'' in some way, said Lois Sloane, TBS' vicepresident for licensing and merchandising.   The requests are screened carefully and only those that properlyhonor the film are granted licensing agreements, Ms. Sloane saidMonday from her New York office.   ``We care very much about `Gone With The Wind,''' Ms. Sloanesaid.   Most of the products approved for licensing are geared toadults, she said _ things such as commemorative plates, stationeryand figurines. Items such as toys and hard liquor have beenrejected, she said.   TBS Chairman Ted Turner's fondness for ``Gone With The Wind'' iswell known. It is shown daily at the movie theater at Turner's CNNCenter in downtown Atlanta.   Terms of the deal with Fujisankei were not disclosed.   Attorney Clarke said the appearance of ``Gone With The Wind''wine was unexpected. ``This came as quite a surprise to us,'' hesaid.   Clarke said he intended to examine the agreement to make sure``it's on firm ground,'' but doubted he had any legal grounds tooppose it. He said the estate has not objected to marketing schemeswhen they ``promote the sale of the movie or the book.''   The wine will go on sale in Japan May 1 and will cost between$11 and $17 a bottle, compared to about $8 a bottle for mostCalifornia wines sold there. Currently most wine sold in Japan isFrench.   About 10,000 cases of ``Gone With the Wind,'' to be distributedby Sanraku, are being shipped initially.   Atlanta historian Franklin Garrett, who knew Miss Mitchell as ayoung writer, expressed amusement at the idea of a ``Gone With theWind'' wine.   ``I don't know _ `Gone With the Wind' wine sounds pretty good,though it probably hasn't got the remotest connection to `Gone Withthe Wind,''' Garrett said.   ``I guess it's a compliment to the book,'' he added. ``But ifyou get to using it too much for things other than the book, itmight lose its distinctiveness.''</TEXT></DOC>
