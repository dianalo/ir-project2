In their class action suit, filed in 1978, 14,000 Indians contended that the state's purchases of the parcels in the 1780s were illegal. The Indians, who first contested the sale in 1794, sought billions of dollars in damages for the fair rental value of the land, plus interest and even the tolls that the New York Thruway has collected for passage over the land.    &quot;This is a total victory for the state, the counties, the towns and the private landowners,&quot; said the state's lawyer Allan Van Gestal, of the Boston law firm Goodwin, Procter andamp; Hoar. A ruling in favor of the Indians, he said, &quot;would mean New York has always been trespassing, so highways, hospitals, everything would be rendered illegal, not to mention the billions of dollars involved.&quot;    Though there have been numerous Indian land claim cases nationwide since the 1950s, this was the first involving purchases prior to the U.S. Constitution. The three-judge panel of the appeals court noted that the case was unusual &quot;because it requires a federal court, perhaps for the first time, to determine whether actions of a state violated the Articles of Confederation.&quot;    The issue has been whether state purchases of Indian land under the Articles are legitimate. New York purchased the Oneida parcels in 1785 and 1788 when the Articles, which emphasized states' rights over a centralized government, were the law of the land. The U.S. Constitution, which became effective in March 1789, said only the federal government has the power to purchase Indian lands.    Further, the Constitution has a clause that honors all treaties prior to its inception. The Indians have claimed that a 1784 treaty, negotiated in return for the Oneida's support of the U.S. in the Revolutionary War, gave them federal protection from the state's efforts to buy their land. &quot;It should be a matter of honor for the U.S. to abide by that treaty,&quot; said Ms. Locklear.    The appeals court, in upholding a decision out of the Northern District of New York, ruled that purchases under the Articles are indeed legitimate. It also said the 1784 treaty is legitimate, but it does not protect the Indians from the state's purchase of the land. Rather, the treaty was meant to shelter their land from the four hostile Iroquois nations that had sided with the British during the Revolutionary War. The Oneida Nation is one of six member nations in the Iroquois Confederacy.    If the Oneidas had prevailed, said Ms. Locklear, other similar suits could have succeeded in the country's original 13 colonies. </TEXT></DOC>
