F-4 Phantom jets from Clark flew air cover Dec. 1 for loyalistforces at the request of President Corazon Aquino, helping tothwart the revolt. The jets did not fire on the rebels butprevented them from continuing air strikes on the presidentialpalace and military camps in Manila.   Clark servicemen said they were restricted to the base or theiroff-base residences from Dec. 1 until Thursday and security wastightened. Troops also were told not to talk to reporters.   A sergeant from Wisconsin, who refused to identify himselffurther, said the general feeling on the base after the flightswas, ``Oh oh, now for the first time we're actually involved.What's going to happen? What retribution is going to happen?''   Concern was not restricted to what the mutinous soldiers mightdo in response to the U.S. action. Soldiers said there also wasconcern about the Communist rebels active in the region, who arebelieved responsible for at least five slayings of American GIs inrecent years.   But when travel off the base was resumed, the airmen rushed forthe gates to the streets of Angeles, a city of dank honky-tonk barsand restaurants that cater largely to the U.S. community of 10,000active servicemen and about 16,000 dependants. The main stripfeatures McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Shakey'srestaurants.   ``When I heard at 20 minutes after 3 o'clock I could go offbase, I was downtown by 4,'' said the sergeant.   ``It was nice just to get out of the room again,'' said theIdaho airman, who also refused to give his name.   Several soldiers in shorts and T-shirts strolled off the basethis morning, shooing away vendors selling sunglasses or catchingrides into town. One GI hurrying from the base was dressed in fullbaseball uniform with glove tucked under his arm.   Angeles had been a ghost town during the days airmen wererestricted to quarters, with many businesses shut down completely.An Australian bar owner said his business was down at least 60percent.   ``I would say it had a very big effect on the working girls'' inthe bars, said Mick O'Brien, owner of Moon Doggies, across thestreet from the base. He said prostitutes were particularly hardhit because the Christmas season traditionally is when they needmoney to send to their families in the provinces.   In October 1987, the economy of this city in central Luzon wasdevastated after troops were confined to barracks following thekillings of three Americans by Communist rebels.   Josie Navarro, ``mama-san,'' or madam, at the Bombay Court downthe street, also complained that business was ``so bad since Dec.1. We had no GI customers.''   But Friday night, the bar was again filled with U.S. servicemendrinking San Miguel beer and shooting pool on the Bombay's twofaded billiard tables.   ``We still like Americans,'' the mama-san said, leaning acrossthe bar for emphasis. ``We don't want the business to go away.''</TEXT></DOC>
