(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State Attorney General Charlie Brown hasabruptly resigned in exchange for an end to a grand juryinvestigation of allegations that he lied under oath and of hiscampaign financial records.   And today the grand jury indicted a former secretary to Brown oncharges that she tried to extort money from him in exchange forkeeping quiet about allegations that he got her pregnant.   Under an agreement with Kanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes,Brown cannot discuss his innocence or guilt regarding the grand juryinvestigation.   ``I don't believe in beating dead horses. I believe justice wasdone,'' Forbes said at a Monday night news conference.   ``If you resign from the attorney general's office of the state,that's a pretty darned harsh penalty,'' Forbes said.   At a news conference today, Brown said his decision to resign wasbased on family obligations, including concerns he had to protecthis young daughter, who is at the center of a child custody disputethat gave rise to the perjury allegation.   ``No public official is more important that the office he or sheholds,'' Brown said. ``But my biggest fear was something much worse_ ublicity about my child's life, welfare and current homeenvironment.''   It is the second time this year a major West Virginia stateofficial has quit amid allegations of misconduct. Treasurer A. JamesManchin, who was accused of mismanaging a state investment fund thatlost an estimated $279 million and was impeached by the House,resigned last month just before his Senate trial was to begin.   It also was the second criminal case against Brown since he tookoffice in 1984.   Brown's resignation was effective at 5 p.m. Monday.   ``It was in the best interest of the state, the best interest ofMr. Brown, and the best interest of all concerned,'' Forbes said.   Gov. Gaston Caperton will appoint an interim attorney general,who will serve until the next election.   Forbes said his office worked ``very intensely'' on theinvestigation for four weeks. He said Brown's attorney called hisoffice about noon Monday and agreed to the arrangement, which Forbessaid the prosecutor's office first offered about a week ago beforethe grand jury began meeting.   Brown, 39, a Democrat, had testified Thursday, Friday and Mondaybefore the grand jury. Forbes said he had planned to ask for a voteon charges sometime Monday afternoon or today.   In 1986, Brown was acquitted on charges that he solicited hisstaff for campaign contributions. The jury agreed with his defensethat, because he solicited the contributions after the 1984 electionto help pay off his campaign debts, the actions did not violated astate law prohibiting state officials from soliciting contributionsfor future campaigns.   The latest grand jury investigation centered on Brown's testimonyin a child custody hearing involving his ex-wife, Alice SueHypes-Brown, and their 5-year-old daughter.   Forbes has confirmed that the grand jury was looking into areport that Brown had denied writing a note that was introduced asevidence in the hearing, then later admitted writing it.   Brown acknowledged that he denied writing the note but said thatit was a mistake and that he realized it almost immediately. He saidhe requested a brief recess, and when the hearing resumed hecorrected his testimony.   In a statement today, Brown said that even though he hadcorrected the statements he made during the hearing, he still wouldhave faced ``potential months of protracted litigation'' if indicted.   The Charleston Gazette reported two weeks ago that the noteinvolved a request for $50,000 from Brown's former secretary, whothe paper said had been impregnated by Brown, had an abortion anddemanded the money to keep quiet.   The secretary, Brenda K. Simon, 35, of Columbus, Ohio, today wasindicted on one count each of extortion and obtaining money underfalse pretenses. The extortion count carries a maximum penalty offive years in prison, while the false pretenses charge carries amaximum penalty of 10 years.   Shortly after the indictment was announced this morning,attorneys for Simon withdrew a $3 million libel lawsuit against theGazette, saying they didn't want the suit to jeopardize Simon'scriminal defense.   Forbes said he don't know how much money was allegedly extorted,saying reports have varied from $7,500 to $50,000.   There was no immediate comment from Simon; telephone calls to herhome went unanswered.   In addition, the grand jury subpoenaed Brown's campaign recordsfrom 1984 through 1988.   Brown's brother, Sherrod Brown, is Ohio's secretary of state.</TEXT></DOC>
