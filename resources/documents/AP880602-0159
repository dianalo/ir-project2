(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four zoo workers have become moms to amarmoset abandoned by her real mother, and thanks to their tenderloving care, little Eliza seems to be thriving.   The 2-ounce, 6-week-old pygmy marmoset with the 4-inch tail wasdropped by her mother when she was just 3 days old.   With two other offspring to care for, the mother Julia didn'tretrieve her thumb-sized baby. But the keepers at Folsom Children'sZoo rescued Eliza and placed her in an infant isolette to increasethe tiny monkey's chances of survival.   Nightly, one of the four surrogate parents lugs home the50-pound isolette and caters to Eliza's hunger every two hours witha specially mixed baby formula dripped through a syringe.   Zoo director John Chapo says he expects Eliza will be reunitedwith her family in a few weeks. The father, Miguel, and mom Juliahave been in isolation and out of public view since mid-Marchduring the pregnancy and infancy of the three offspring, Eliza andtwo yet unnamed babies.   Last year the pygmy pair gave birth to triplets, but all threedied, Chapo said.   This time the zoo didn't want to take any chances. Since onlyabout 90 pygmy marmosets were in captivity around the world at theend of last year, according to the international species inventorysystem, Chapo said he wanted to make sure all three monkeyssurvived.</TEXT><DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   These four little piggies aren't going tomarket. Instead, they're hogging the limelight atop the city'sbicentennial monument.   The bronze flying porkers measure 4{ feet from tail to spreadwing tips. They stand on their hind legs on bright blue replicas ofriverboat smokestacks.   As part of the sculpture at the entrance of the BicentennialCommons at the new Sawyer Point park, they celebrate the city'sheyday in the 1880s as ``Porkopolis,'' the Midwest's hog-butcheringcapital.   Three pigs covered with black cloth were lifted into placeTuesday night by a mechanical lift. The fourth was flown inWednesday on a Coast Guard helicopter and lowered into place.   Some Cincinnatians had complained the pigs would make the citylook foolish. They flooded local newspapers and City Council withletters and calls of protest.   The council tried to settle the dispute in January by conductinga hearing to air the gripes. Council members donned plastic pigsnouts for the raucous gathering, and one woman even cradled apiglet.   But the mediation failed when the council's attorney said thecouncilors were powerless because the sculpture already had beenproperly approved.</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif.
