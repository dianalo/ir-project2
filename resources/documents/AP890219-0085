The talks, to begin Monday, were organized by the seven-memberArab League committee charged with seeking a settlement of thepolitical crisis that has left Lebanon without a president for thepast 147 days.   The leaders arriving from Beirut Sunday were Maronite CatholicPartriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, Greek Catholic Patriarch Maximos Hakim,Sunni Moslem Grand Mufti Sheik Hassan Khaled, the acting chairman ofthe Supreme Shiite Moslem Council, Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin;and the supreme religious judge of the Druse community, Sheik MurselNasr.   The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Hazim, spiritualleader of an estimated 300,000 Lebanese, flew from his home in theSyrian capital, Damascus.   They were met by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmed, whoheads the Arab League panel. Also on the panel are the foreignministers of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Tunisia, Sudan andAlgeria and the league's Secretary-General Chedli Klibi.   Before his departure, Patriarch Sfeir appealed to Lebanese armycommander Gen. Michel Aoun and Christian militia leader Samir Geageato avoid a recurrence of the clash between their forces last weekthat shook Lebanon's Christian heartland. Aoun and Geagea are bothMaronites.   Police said 76 people were killed and 200 wounded during two daysof fierce fighting between Aoun's 20,000 Christian regular soldiersand the 6,000 iregulars of Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia, theChristians' main force in the civil war with Moslems.   The first stage of the talks was held in Tunisia last month, whenthe committee probed the crisis separately with Aoun, who heads theChristian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, and with his Sunnirival, Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.   The two governments emerged when President Amin Gemayel appointedAoun prime minister of a caretaker military cabinet on Sept. 22,minutes before his 6-year term ended. Parliament was unable toconvene to elect a successor.   Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment, contending it violated anunwritten national covenant dating to Lebanon's independence fromFrance in 1943. This covenant gave the premiership to the Sunnis,the paliamentary speakership to the Shiites and the presidency tothe Maronites.   Lebanon has been divided into Moslem and Christian de factocantons since the 1975 outbreak of the civil war that has claimedmore than 130,000 lives.   Each enclave has been rocked by internal power struggles.   Aoun, who makes no secret of his hopes to become Lebanon's nextpresident, is pressing for an unconditional withdrawal of Geagea'smilitias from Christian east Beirut and all its suburbs as aprecondition for peace.   Geagea says he will withdraw if he gets guarantees that theSyrian army and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah will withdraw from westBeirut.</TEXT></DOC>
