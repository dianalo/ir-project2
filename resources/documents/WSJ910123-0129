This is not to denigrate the courage of the men -- eitherthen or now -- who actually fight the battles. But it isundeniable that the dazzling display of military mastery inthe skies over Kuwait and Iraq is also a tribute to thetechnological genius of this nation.</LP><TEXT>   The daily news is full of descriptions of how high-techweaponry is reducing the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. Yetif Congress has its way, the U.S. won't be building very manyof these weapons any more.   Many in the media and Congress believe that the Pentagonspends too much on night fighting equipment, laser-guidedmunitions, cruise missiles, Stealth aircraft and anti-missilesystems. To the disgust of the most vociferous of theircritics, however, all of these weapons have been found towork, even in the extraordinary conditions of the Saudidesert.   Perhaps most remarkable of all, the astonishingeffectiveness of the Patriot anti-missile missile has proventhat incoming missiles can be destroyed in flight -- apossibility derided for a decade by the critics of theStrategic Defense Initiative.   With biting criticism and with promises to &quot;save our taxdollars,&quot; Congress voted on the eve of Saddam Hussein'sbrutal invasion of Kuwait to gut the SDI program and killfurther Stealth development. Even after the invasion,Congress voted to reduce defense expenditures, on the theorythat peace was at hand.   History should be a guide to the future. But there's noneed to reach as far back as Waterloo. We can look to moreproximate events to see that disarmament does not work, thatweakened defenses encourage aggression and that duplicity onthe part of despots can be disastrous for democracies thattrust them. And even when Saddam is gone from the scene, theworld must face the &quot;new&quot; Mikhail Gorbachev, the BalticButcher -- a Nobel laureate with more divisions and missilesthan anyone. With the world's attention focused on thePersian Gulf, the Soviets acted -- as they have so often inthe past -- brutally to repress a captive people.   Soviet actions in Lithuania and Latvia are not unlikethose in Hungary in 1956 -- when the U.S. was distracted bythe Suez Canal crisis and a presidential election; or inCzechoslovakia in 1968 -- when the U.S. was preoccupied withthe carnage in Vietnam; or in Afghanistan in 1979 -- when theU.S. was absorbed by the Iranian hostage crisis.   Despite the economic disasters of Soviet society, despitenot being able to feed his people, Mr. Gorbachev continues anunabated military buildup. The Soviets are still producingnuclear missiles to be aimed at American cities. The Sovietnavy's nuclear submarine program roars on at flank speed.Soviet aircraft and tank production lines roll out newmodels.   Mr. Gorbachev's apologists insist that all of this is theconsequence of a reactionary cabal that is attempting to slowthe Soviet Union's swing toward democracy. Those who want tohelp Mr. Gorbachev to survive are even willing to overlookhis blatant efforts to circumvent the provisions of therecently concluded treaty on conventional arms reduction.   Rose-colored glasses may fit well on the noses ofreporters, bureaucrats or even diplomats. They should not beworn by those who must look to the future defense of thisnation. The technology at use today in the Gulf is essentialto our survival and safety. The lesson of Desert Storm andthe concurrent events in the Soviet Union is: restore fundingfor the systems eliminated in last year's defense budget.   To those who say we can't afford to build more high techweapons, the answer should be that we can't afford not to.   ---   Mr. North, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel, ischairman of Guardian Technologies International, a Virginiacompany that makes police equipment, and president of FreedomAlliance, an educational foundation also in Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
