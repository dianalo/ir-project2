The measure was quickly signed by President Reagan.    The action will force substantial crew-size reductions on the United Transportation Union and could herald similar cuts at other railroads, according to a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, a Washington-based industry group. Most railroads say that to achieve needed gains in productivity, they will press for cuts in crews in contract talks with rail unions.    The legislation imposes recommendations made by a presidential emergency board on both CNW and the union. CNW, a Chicago-based railroad holding company, must keep about 350 brakemen on freight trains of its Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation unit; but it may trim crews to three people from four on most of those trains. CNW proposed in May 1987 to cut freight crews to two, eliminating 1,156 jobs and saving about $53 million a year.    A cooling-off period ordered by Congress expired early Friday, freeing the railroad to put the changes into effect and freeing the union to strike. But the two sides agreed to delay action until 9 a.m. CDT Friday to allow Chicago commuters to get to work and Congress to try to resolve the issue.    The subsequent strike halted freight service and threatened to strand 44,000 commuters, but the House passed legislation Friday afternoon and Mr. Reagan quickly signed it.    The emergency board's recommendations will mean severance payments of $45,000 to each fired brakeman and $50,000 to those who resign voluntarily. The transport union has insisted that smaller crews would reduce safety.    &quot;No one likes the agreement,&quot; but everyone is &quot;resigned&quot; to it as the only way to resolve the dispute, said Rep. Terry Bruce (D., Ill.), who shepherded the bill through the House. Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) wrote the measure.    Mr. Reagan appointed the emergency board in April to try to resolve the issue, an action that launched a cooling-off period that expired Aug. 4. After a short strike that day, Congress reinstated the cooling-off period until Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
