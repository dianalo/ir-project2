AndyIreland, R-Fla., who wondered whether the Defense Department mightcreate some mission simply to use the six ground-launched cruisemissile and three Pershing 2 operating bases left open with thesigning of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.   The U.S.-Soviet pact eliminated intermediate-range nuclearmissiles.   Republicans and Democrats on the House Armed Servicessubcommittee on military installations and facilities questionedwhat the Pentagon plans to do with the bases, which cost the UnitedStates $394 million to construct and $67 million in family housing.NATO spent $312 million on the bases.   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of thesubcommittee, asked whether the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, whichSpain demanded leave the base at Torrejon de Ardoz, could berelocated to one of the INF bases.   The United States plans to move the wing to Crotone, Italy,where construction of a new base is expected to cost NATO more than$800 million, with the United States paying $26 million forconstruction.   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., emphasized that lawmakers do notwant to see the bases go unused, and reminded Pentagon officialsthat the nation cannot afford to construct a new base at Crotone.   ``We remember the birthing of the ground-launched cruise missilebases,'' said Dickinson, who listed all the facilities that had tobe built on the base, including schools, commissaries and chapels.   ``We can't start from scratch again,'' Dickinson said. ``Themoney is just not there. ... Why can't we have some alternativeuse.''   John A. Woodworth, deputy assistant secretary of defense forinternational security policy, said U.S. officials are studyingways to make the most efficient use of the bases.   He also sought to assure Ireland that Pentagon officials aren'tmaking up possible missions for the bases.   ``I don't think the objective is to tell people in the field todevelop uses of these bases so we have a good story,'' Woodworthsaid.   Committee members also questioned why the 15,000 troops assignedto operate the facilities could not return home. Defense SecretaryDick Cheney has proposed in the fiscal 1990 budget bringing backabout 4,000 troops from Europe and replacing a brigade at FortCarson, Colo., with National Guard reserves.   Woodworth said that by the end of fiscal 1991, the number of``personnel spaces'' in Europe to support the Pershings will bereduced by 5,685 from the total of 14,562.   The remaining personnel will be used for air base grounddefense, medical war readiness and upgrade of an undermanned combatsupport and service unit, Woodworth said.   But Schroeder complained that instead of taking troops fromEurope, the Pentagon plans to cut the brigade in her home state,and Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, said leaving a high number oftroops in Europe would not save taxpayers' dollars.   Ireland, who has introduced a resolution to reassign civilianand military personnel associated with INF to the United States,said that ``unless we bring our extensive alliance commitments intoline with contemporary fiscal reality, we could set ourselves onthe road to ruin that has brought down so many great powers beforeus.''</TEXT></DOC>
