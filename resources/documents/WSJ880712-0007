Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci is expected to set out today a new plan for how the Pentagon will deal with arms-makers implicated in the nationwide investigation into alleged bribery and bid-rigging. According to one senior Pentagon official, the new regime won't include the steps that the contractors have feared most: an automatic cutoff of payments on the 85 or so defense contracts under investigation.    The decision to end the payments suspension followed confusion in the Defense Department and the industry over which contractors would be subject to the halt. Moreover, the Pentagon lacks information on whether contractors or their consultants did anything illegal to win business. That will likely surface months from now once the investigation is further along.    The halt in payments would have covered nine electronics projects run by the Navy, which is the center of the two-year investigation. The largest is a series of anti-submarine communications centers, which the Navy values at $712 million.    TRW Inc. is the prime contractor on the system, and as many as 100 smaller companies are working as subcontractors.    The following contractors also were included in the short-lived suspension: Loral Corp., Litton Corp., Unisys Corp., Raytheon Corp., and the Hughes aircraft unit of General Motors Co.    The Pentagon has suspended from future defense business Continental Electronics, a Dallas-based unit of Varian Associates, a relatively small contractor based in Palo Alto, Calif. In a filing last month in U.S. District Court in Dallas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it believed that a Continental vice president engaged in a criminal scheme with a defense consultant to funnel Navy electronics jobs to the unit.    The Pentagon also said previously announced suspensions of individuals probably will continue until the investigation and subsequent legal proceedings are completed. The individuals are Mark Saunders, Thomas Muldoon, and Joe Bradley, three defense consultants under investigation for improperly helping contractors obtain defense jobs. George Stone, a Navy employee implicated in the scandal, also has been suspended without pay.    Attorneys for Messrs. Saunders and Muldoon have said their clients didn't do anything improper, and Mr. Stone's attorney has declined to comment. Mr. Bradley couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Carlucci is expected to describe in Senate hearings today his plan for dealing with future revelations from the two yearinvestigation. Under the plan, the Pentagon's reaction to such disclosures will be milder in the future than the just-abandoned cutoff in payments that followed previous disclosures.    For contractors already at work on military equipment, the Defense Department likely will continue to make payments, but might suspend companies from future business if it is shown they won jobs through inside information or bid-rigging. On programs where contracts haven't actually been awarded, the Pentagon will consider demanding that companies agree to forgo profits on defense jobs if it is later shown they won their contracts through improper means.    Separately, an attorney for Melvyn Paisley, the former assistant Navy secretary who is a central figure in the scandal, said that federal agents found no classified materials when they searched the Washington office and suburban Virginia house of his client last month. Robert Plotkin, the attorney, said he hadn't seen documents confiscated by the FBI, but had reviewed lists of seized materials with Mr. Paisley.    &quot;We dispute (any suggestion) that there was any classified material&quot; in Mr. Paisley's home or office, Mr. Plotkin said.    Government investigators suspect that Mr. Paisley, who left the Navy in March 1987 to become a consultant, supplied classified or confidential information to clients and defense consultants. A search warrant served at Mr. Paisley's home -- and made public in an Alexandria, Va., federal court last Friday -- sought internal Navy documents on a number of weapons programs, including the Navy's secret advanced tactical aircraft.    The warrant also sought information on any payments to Mr. Paisley from defense contractors while he was in the Navy, as well as any information on gifts or money he gave to a former aide of his at the Navy, James Gaines. Mr. Plotkin said that Mr. Paisley hadn't received any money from contractors while he held his government position, and hadn't tried to influence Mr. Gaines, who still is with the Navy. The attorney said that Messrs. Paisley and Gaines, friends for more than two decades, probably had exchanged &quot;insignificant&quot; gifts.    Mr. Plotkin also said that Mr. Paisley had no financial interest in any foreign companies, another possibility raised by the search warrant. The FBI seized a consulting agreement between a company called Lorena Overseas SA and an Israeli company known as Mazlat. He said that Mr. Paisley had &quot;a consulting arrangement with an entity connected to&quot; Lorena Overseas.    Mr. Plotkin said that the search warrant contains suggestions by investigators that are &quot;perhaps just one shade above pure speculation.&quot; He said that information detailed in the warrant should be viewed as &quot;investigative leads,&quot; not as &quot;dead-bang&quot; facts. </TEXT></DOC>
