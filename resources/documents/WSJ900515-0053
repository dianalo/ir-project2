Bosses arefaulted, too.   In a scathing indictment of both workers and managers,three of four engineers surveyed by the Institute ofIndustrial Engineers agree &quot;the loss of a strong work ethicin this country contributes to low productivity.&quot; By widemargins, they believe employees don't work as hard or aswell, or are as loyal or motivated as 10 years ago. Workers,moreover, are ill-educated, unenthusiastic and resistant tochange.</LP><TEXT>   Companies are bashed for ignoring the problem. &quot;Managementlacks the commitment to implement productivity programs foremployees,&quot; three-quarters of the engineers say. And fully91% of them state &quot;companies are more interested inshort-term financial gain than in long-term investment inproductivity and quality.&quot; Workers aren't consulted beforedecisions are made, say the engineers.   Productivity will increase if pay is linked to performanceand profit, the engineers believe.                                                                                                          BALONEY, retort companies and unions. Workers are better,they say.   &quot;I totally disagree with all the statements made,&quot;declares George Graham, a senior vice president of TexasInstruments Inc. Education remains a &quot;major concern for allof us,&quot; but motivation, dedication and enthusiasm are &quot;on asignificant upswing,&quot; he asserts. Robert McClure, presidentof Tandy Corp.'s Tandy Electronics subsidiary, says &quot;theAmerican worker has come a long way.&quot; Today's employees are&quot;working smarter,&quot; Johnson Controls Inc. concurs.   Chrysler Corp.'s advertising trumpets its belief thatAmerican workmanship has improved, a point seconded by theUnited Auto Workers. &quot;All the solid work done in this areacontradicts the opinions presented in this survey,&quot; the unionsays. And Richard Van Bell, Deere andamp; Co.'s personnel director,asserts American management is committed to quality.Managers, he says, are &quot;getting better and better&quot; atlistening to what workers can contribute. Many agree withLarry Brady, executive vice president of FMC Corp., that payfor performance does, indeed, motivate.                                                                                                          EXECUTIVE SPENDING: Have business jitters closed thepersonal checkbook?   Joel Kovner, chief executive of Professional Bancorp, is&quot;more frugal&quot; these days. &quot;I have the sense that now is thetime to accumulate cash,&quot; he says. Besides, he declares,conspicuous consumption has become &quot;socially unacceptable.&quot;Ted Rybicki, a vice president of Sun Banks, hopes Mr. Kovneris right. &quot;People are too much into this materialism,&quot; hesays. &quot;There are a lot more important things in life.&quot;   Henry Coffey, a vice president at J.C. Bradford andamp; Co.,allows he is spending more, what with a variable-ratemortgage, the kids and medical bills. &quot;But we're being muchmore guarded about it. That comes from being extremelynervous. I'm in the brokerage industry. You fill in theblanks.&quot; But George Zeck, a vice president at Shearson LehmanHutton, says his business has been good the past year, sohe's bought a 32-foot sailboat and a place in Florida.   Me generation free spending hasn't changed &quot;becausethere's no reason&quot; for it to change, Mr. Zeck contends.                                                                                                          POOR GRADES: One in four job applicants tested in readingor math lacks the skills needed for the jobs wanted, anAmerican Management Association survey finds. One in nineflunks drug tests.                                                                                                          LOSERS LEAVE. Half the executives who attempt leveragedbuy-outs of their companies don't succeed, and three-quartersof these failed bidders leave the firms in a year, recruiterChristian andamp; Timbers says.                                                                                                          PENSION FUNDS hold 26% of the equity and 15% of thetaxable bonds in the U.S. economy, the Employee BenefitResearch Institute estimates. The pot, figured at the closeof 1989, comes to $2.5 trillion.                                                                                                          FORGET ANOTHER &quot;rule of thumb,&quot; that the higher yoursalary the longer it takes to find a job. Jannotta, Bray andamp;Associates, an outplacement firm, says posts paying above$70,000 all take 5 1/2 months.                                                                                                          LIVING BENEFITS are added to worker insurance policies.But employees pay.   Mead Corp. considered long-term-care insurance to helpterminally ill workers cope with the massive expenses thatoften accompany the end of life. It opted, instead, for thelower cost -- especially for younger workers -- of aliving-benefit rider to the group universal life coveragealready offered. Such riders customarily allow holders tocollect 50% of their life insurance if they are terminallyill and face expensive care.   The coverage -- through Cigna, Mutual of Omaha andTravelers insurance companies, so far -- isn't cheap.Employees have to pick up the full tab, and it might cost a40-year-old man an extra $100 a month. Still, one in fiveworkers signed up in two months when Mead offered it to10,000 salaried employees. At Allied-Signal Corp., 42% of theworkers with universal life policies opted for theliving-benefit rider when the coverage was offered to them.   Unlike life insurance, living benefits are taxable. But aSenate bill would make them tax exempt.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Corporate vice presidents rank their bosseshigh on energy, self-confidence and assertiveness but low asvisionaries or open to ideas, consultant Management Science andamp;Development finds. . . .
