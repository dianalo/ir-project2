Despite the gloomy fourth quarter, 1990 net income for thenation's 12,338 commercial banks rose to $16.6 billion, up $1billion from 1989, when major banks set aside large reservesagainst loans to developing nations.</LP><TEXT>   In an accompanying report, the FDIC said that 473 savingsbanks had a loss of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, whichwidened from the $789 million loss a year earlier. For 1990as a whole, savings banks' losses grew to $2.4 billion from$773 million in 1989. The industry's problems areconcentrated in New England, where more than half the savingsbanks lost money in the fourth quarter.   FDIC Chairman William Seidman called the latest results &quot;avery poor fourth quarter for the banking industry&quot; and warnedthat &quot;we don't see a good quarter coming along.&quot;Nevertheless, he said there are some hints that the worst maybe over on real estate loans, for which banks have had to setaside large reserves against shaky loans.   &quot;There are indications that it's bottoming out innonperforming loans, but not enough yet,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.&quot;The rate of slide seems to have lessened.&quot; As a result, heexpects this year's first quarter to be &quot;perhaps not quite asbleak as the fourth quarter.&quot;   Mr. Seidman used the release of the report to repeat hiscomplaint that some banks are depleting their capital bypaying too much in dividends. He said that 354 banks paiddividends after reporting a net loss for 1990 and thatanother 1,047 banks paid dividends that exceeded their 1990earnings. As a group, commercial banks paid dividends equalto 83% of the net income, which Mr. Seidman called &quot;a veryhigh number under current circumstances.&quot;   The report shows that the banking industry's problems arespread unevenly. In 1990, 13% of all the nation's banks wereunprofitable, but 25% of the 49 banks with assets of morethan $10 billion were unprofitable and 27% of the 1,068 banksin the Northeast were unprofitable. In addition, nearly 55%of the nation's commercial banks showed increased earningslast year.   Last year, 169 federally insured commercial and savingsbanks failed, and the number of institutions on the FDIC'sproblem list fell to 1,046 from 1,106, and from a peak of1,575 in 1987. But the average size of the banks on theproblem list grew.</TEXT></DOC>
