The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since our preliminary determination (54 FR 5112, February 1, 1989), thefollowing events have occurred. A public hearing was held on March 28,1989. Petitioner filed a pre-hearing brief on March 22, 1989, and a post-hearingbrief on March 31, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by this investigation. The products covered by this investigation are industrial belts from Taiwan,currently provided for under TSUSA item numbers 358.0210, 358.0290, 358.0610,358.0690, 358.0800, 358.0900, 358.1100, 358.1400, 358.1600, 657.2520, 773.3510,and 773.3520 and currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 5910.00.10,5910.00.90, 4010.10.10, 4010.10.50, 3926.90.55, 4010.91.11, 4010.99.11,3926.90.56, 3926.90.59, 4010.91.19, 4010.99.19, 3926.90.57, 4010.91.15,4010.99.15, 7326.20.00, 3926.90.60, 4010.91.50 and 4010.99.50. The merchandise covered by this investigation includes certain industrialbelts for power transmission. These include V-belts, synchronous belts,round belts and flat belts, in part or wholly of rubber or plastic, andcontaining textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord orstrand, and whether in endless (i.e., closed loop) belts, or in beltingin lengths or links. This investigation excludes conveyor belts and automotivebelts as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered byinternal combustion engines, including trucks, tractors, buses, and lifttrucks. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation is January 1, 1988 through June 30, 1988. Our investigation was limited to Hsing Kwo Rubber Mfg. Co., Ltd. (HsingKwo), the producer responsible for the bulk of Taiwanese exports of thisproduct to the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons </ITAG>For Hsing Kwo, pursuant to section 771(16)(C) of the Act, we establishedone category of ``such or similar'' merchandise: V-belts. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of industrial belts from Taiwan to the U.S.were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value, pursuant to sections 772 and 773 of the Act,respectively.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>In our preliminary determination we calculated United States price usingexporter's sales price methodology. However, as a result of informationgathered at verification, we determined that purchase price would be theappropriate method. Virtually all of Hsing Kwo's sales are made througha related sales agent in the U.S. prior to importation. The related salesagent, Hsing Kwo USA (HKUSA), receives orders and transmits them to Taiwan.The manufacturer in Taiwan then packs the merchandise for each order incartons stamped with shipping marks identifying the ultimate customer.The cartons are then packed into international shipping containers (alongwith cartons of V-belts destined for other customers as well as cartonsof merchandise not covered by this investigation) which are shipped toHKUSA. HKUSA unpacks the containers and forwards the individual cartonson to the ultimate purchasers. For these sales, the Department has determined that purchase price is theappropriate basis for U.S. price based on the following elements: 1. The merchandise in question was not introduced into the inventory ofa related selling agent; 2. This was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and 3. The related selling agent located in the U.S. acted as a processor ofsales-related documentation, as a communication link with the unrelatedU.S. buyer, and as a freight forwarder. Given this, we regard the routine selling functions of the exporter asmerely having been relocated geographically from the country of exportationto the U.S., where the sales agent performs them. Whether these functionstake place in the U.S. or abroad does not change the substance of the transactionsor the functions themselves. Because the balance of Hsing Kwo's sales (exporter's sales price transactions)was minimal, we have disregarded them for purposes of this determination.We calculated purchase price based on packed, f.o.b. seller's warehouseprices to unrelated purchasers in the U.S. We made deductions, where appropriate,for a harbor construction tax, inland freight and brokerage in Taiwan,ocean freight, marine insurance, and merchandise processing fees, harbormaintenance fees, customs duty, customs brokerage, and inland freight inthe U.S. An addition was made, pursuant to section 772(d)(1)(B) of theAct, for import duties imposed by the country of exportation which havebeen rebated, or which have not been collected by reason of the exportationof the merchandise to the United States. We also added the amount of valueadded taxes which would have been collected if the merchandise had notbeen exported.Minor revisions were made to certain charges. Based on verified information,brokerage, inland freight (for both Taiwan and the U.S.), and ocean freightwere recalculated on a per inch basis, rather than value. All other charges,which had been allocated based on U.S. sales value were reallocated accordingto the basis on which they were incurred (<T3>e.g.,</T3> c.i.f. Los Angeles, f.o.b. Taiwan port).<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>We determined there were sufficient sales in the home market to serve asthe basis for calculating foreign market value. In accordance with section773 of the Act, we calculated foreign market value based on packed, f.o.b.seller's warehouse or delivered prices to unrelated purchasers in Taiwan.We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight.We made adjustments, where applicable, for differences in the physicalcharacteristics of the merchandise in accordance with andSection; 353.16of the regulations.We made adjustments under andSection; 353.15(a) of the Commerce Regulationsfor differences in circumstances of sale for credit expenses where appropriate,and we offset commissions paid in the U.S. market with indirect sellingexpenses incurred in the home market.We made an upward adjustment to the tax-exclusive home market prices forthe value-added tax we computed for U.S. price.Based on verified information, corrections were made to U.S. packing. Certainother charges and corrections were made using verified data.Inland freight was recalculated on a per-inch basis.Unreported credit and commission expenses on U.S. sales were included.The home market interest rate was corrected, and difference in merchandiseadjustments which had originally been applied to three belt types wereapplied to other belt types, where appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>As noted above, we are basing United States price for all of our fair valuecomparisons on purchase price. Section 353.56(as)(1) of the Departmentof Commerce Regulations requires that in the case of purchase price transactions,the conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars shall be made as ofthe date of purchase or agreement to purchase. In this instance, becauseHsing Kwo apparently assumed that United States price would be based onexporter's sales price, it provided only the date the merchandise was ``sold''(invoiced) by Hsing Kwo's related selling agent in the U.S._not the datethe goods were purchased (ordered) by the ultimate unrelated customer.Since the date of purchase was not supplied by Hsing Kwo, we have usedas best information available, the highest exchange rate certified by theFederal Reserve Bank of New York for the period of investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>On June 30, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Taiwan. Section735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinedthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>We generally consider the following factors in determining whether importshave been massive over a relatively short period of time: (1) The volumeand value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3)the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports.Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on basket TSUSA categories, we requested specific data on shipmentsof the subject merchandise as the most appropriate basis for our determinationsof critical circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that company-specificcritical circumstances determinations better fulfill the objective of thecritical circumstances provision of deterring specific companies that maytry to increase imports massively prior to the suspension of liquidation.We have asked Hsing Kwo to supply monthly volume shipment data in orderfor the Department to base the critical circumstances determination oncompany-specific data. We verified the information submitted by Hsing Kwo.Because the verified data submitted by Hsing Kwo indicates that there havenot been massive imports over a relatively short period, we find that therequirements of section 735(a)(3)(B) are not satisfied for Hsing Kwo.We examined recent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currentlyno findings of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subjectmerchandise by Hsing Kwo. It is our standard practice to impute knowledgeof dumping under section 735(a)(3)(A) of the Act when the estimated marginsin our determinations are of such a magnitude that the importer shouldrealize that dumping exists with regard to the subject merchandise. Normallywe consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient.[See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy (52FR 24198, June 29, 1987).] However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the U.S. through a related company, we consider that lower marginsmay be sufficient. [See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less ThanFair Value; Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Turcks fromJapan (53 FR 12552, April 15, 1988).] Although Hsing Kwo sells in the U.S.through a related company, their margins are not sufficiently high to findthat the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(A) are met. Therefore, we determinethat critical circumstances do not exist with respect to imports of industrialbelts from Taiwan.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>We verified the information used in making our final determination in accordancewith section 776(b) of the Act. We used standard verification proceduresincluding examination of relevant accounting records and original documentsof the respondent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1:</T3> Petitioner contends that the rate for all Taiwanesecompanies should be based on the best information available due to ``substantivedeficiencies'' in Hsing Kwo's response. For further discussion of these``deficiencies'', see the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign MarketValue'' sections of this notice, as well as comments 2-4, and 6-10.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department disagrees. A careful review of pastantidumping cases, <T3>Antifriction Bearings from FRG</T3> (which has been published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, <T3>Light-Walled Welded Rectangular Carbon Steel Tubing from Argentina</T3>(54 FR 13913, April 6, 1989), <T3>Certain Granite Products from Italy</T3> (53 FR 27187, July 19, 1988),and <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished,from Italy</T3> (52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987), reveals that the facts involvedin Industrial Belts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured orUncured, from Taiwan more closely resemble situations where the Departmentused responses, rather than rejecting them due to verification correctionsand new submissions. The recalculations and revisions submitted at verificationdid not substantially exceed the methodological problems and mathematicalerrors commonly found during other investigations. Futhermore, in both<T3>Antifriction Bearings from FRG</T3> and <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished,from Italy</T3>, there was unverified response data. This is not the situationin this case. All data has been satisfactorily verified using standardverification practices and techniques.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department's review ofclerical errors found in Hsing Kwo's sales listing at verification wasone-sided. Petitioner is particularly concerned with the verification team'sfocus on transactions ``where there were high LTFV margins'', but allegedlack of focus on negative LTFV margins.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department disagrees. Petitioner erroneouslyassumes that only errors beneficial to Hsing Kwo were reviewed and corrected.This is not the case. Errors that worked both in Hsing Kwo's favor andagainst Hsing Kwo were discovered by the verification team. The verificationreport states that ``outlier'' sales are ``sales that were considerablyhigher or lower than the norm'', which included sales that had both highand low LTFV margins. A thorough verification of 280 randomly chosen saleswere conducted, in addition to a review of 62 ``outlier'' sales. Petitioner'sclaim that error correction was one-sided is not correct.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Petitioner contends that because the Department couldnot verify the accuracy of the reported dates of sale, ``it is likely thatHK excluded various sales that were actually made during the POI.''<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. While Hsing Kwo reported home marketsales on the basis of invoice date, rather than purchase order date, thedifference between the two dates was not significant. Therefore, we haveaccepted home market sales reported on the basis of invoice date. Withrespect to U.S. sales, Hsing Kwo treated these as exporter's sales pricesales and, hence, reported its sales based on the date that the merchandisewas invoiced to the unrelated U.S. customer. As discussed above, we havedetermined that these transactions are properly treated as purchase pricetransactions. As a result, U.S. sales should have been reported based onthe date of the purchase order. To compensate for this, we have appliedthe highest exchange rate in effect during the period of investigation.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department was unableto verify the volume and value of sales.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department disagrees. The volume and value ofsales were thoroughly verified, and a minor mathematical error made byrespondent was corrected.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> Petitioner argues that if the Department treats HsingKwo's United States sales as purchase price transactions, all selling expensesincurred by HKUSA should be included in adjustments made pursuant to 19U.S.C. 1677a(d)(2) and 19 CFR 353.15(a).<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We have made a circumstance of sale adjustment forall differences in direct selling expenses pursuant to 19 CFR andSection;353.15(a). Furthermore, movement expenses were deducted pursuant to 19U.S.C. 1677a(d)(2).<T3>Comment 6:</T3> Petitioner contends that Hsing Kwo incorrectly reportedits U.S. sales, resulting in ``substantial revision and restatement'' ofall U.S. sales transactions. Additionally, because the corrections cannotbe verified, it will be impossible for the Department to determine theintegrity of the response.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. The revisions referred to by petitionerwere simply separate reporting of previously aggregated data. Moreover,the verification team retained copies of all pertinent invoices, whichenables the Department to check Hsing Kwo's corrections using verifiedinformation for the purpose of making our final determination.<T3>Comment 7:</T3> Petitioner contends that Hsing Kwo did not properlyidentify customer relationships prior to the preliminary determination.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. Hsing Kwo did properly identify customerrelationships. Petitioner seems to be referring to a minor error whereHsing Kwo reported a miniscule number of sales to two related customersin the home market. During verification, these sales were identified; HsingKwo was asked to delete these from their corrected tape. These sales weredropped from the data base as requested.<T3>Comment 8:</T3> Petitioner contends that because Hsing Kwo did notreport packing costs in the home market, the Department is precluded frommaking an adjustment to foreign market value for home market packing forthe purposes of the final determination.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree.<T3>Comment 9: </T3>Petitioner contends that no deduction from foreignmarket value for inland freight should be allowed because respondents shouldnot ``construct a questionnaire response materially different from theoriginal response'' during verification.DOC Position: We disagree. We determined at verification that a quantity-basedmethodology was preferable to the value-based methodology employed by HsingKwo to calculate inland freight expense. We used verified data to recalculateinland freight.<T3>Comment 10: </T3>Petitioner contends that difference in merchandiseadjustment corrections made during verification should not be allowed.DOC Position: We disagree. We used verified data to recalculate these adjustments.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Petitioner contends that because Hsing Kwo was notable to demonstrate clearly direct expenses, that the Department shouldnot make adjustments to foreign market value for these selling expensesif purchase price is used as the basis for United States price.DOC Position: We agree with respect to the expense categories alluded toin petitioner's comment. However, as noted above in the foreign marketvalue section of this notice, based upon verified data, we did make circumstanceof sale adjustments for credit expenses. We also offset U.S. commissionexpenses with indirect selling expenses incurred in the home market.<T3>Comment 12: </T3>Petitioner contends that Hsing Kwo cannot reasonablyadvertise its belts to customers of its original equipment manufacturer(OEM) customers. Also, petitioner contends that the Department should releaseall advertisements obtained during verification.DOC Position: We agree that no advertising expense adjustment should bemade with respect to Hsing Kwo's sales to OEM customers. Because we areunable to identify OEM sales in Hsing Kwo's sales listing, we have madeno circumstance of sale adjustment for advertising expense. Instead, weincluded Hsing Kwo's advertising expense in the pool of indirect expensesused to offset commissions paid on certain U.S. sales. Also, the Departmenthas released all samples of Hsing Kwo's advertising we collected to thepetitioner.<T3>Comment 13: </T3>Petitioner contends that the effective interest ratediscovered at verification should be used to calculate credit costs inthe home market. Additionally, because the Department verified paymentdates to be inaccurate, these dates should not be relied on and a creditadjustment should not be allowed. If an adjustment is allowed, the shortestverified payment date of nine days should be used.DOC Position: We agree that the effective interest rate discovered at verificationshould be used to calculate credit costs. Concerning the credit adjustment,based on verified payment and sales dates, we calculated an average timebetween shipment and payment which we used for the purpose of the finaldetermination.<T3>Comment 14: </T3>Petitioner argues that packing costs in the U.S. marketshould be deducted from United States price. Petitioner further arguesthat according to the Department's verification report, Hsing Kwo underreportedU.S. packing costs and that consequently, if the Department is uncertainof these costs, the highest packing costs for any shipment should be usedfor all shipments.DOC Position: Our methodology requires that we make no deduction from theUnited States sales price for U.S. packing expense, pursuant to section772(d). Rather, we add the U.S. packing expense in calculating foreignmarket value, pursuant to section 772(d)(1), while subtracting home marketpacking expense. As noted above in the ``Foreign Market Value'' sectionof this notice, the respondent did not report home market packing expense,and we have made no deduction from foreign market value for the amount.With regard to the second part of petitioner's comment, verification revealedthat U.S. packing expense was <T3>overstated</T3>, rather than understated in the questionnaire response.For purposes of this final determination, we made the adjustment by usingthe verified average U.S. packing expense. <T3>Comment 15: </T3>Petitioner argues that in calculating United Statesprice, the Department should make an addition for duty drawback only onsales of belts that have a polyester cord.DOC Position: As all of the belts sold to the U.S. by Hsing Kwo duringthe period of investigation are of polyester cord construction, we madean addition for duty drawback for all U.S. sales.<T3>Comment 16: </T3>Petitioner argues that in calculating imputed U.S.credit expense, the Department should use the longest period (104 days)between shipment and payment found at verification for any of Hsing Kwo'sU.S. sales. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. We calculated an average payment periodbased on verified payment and sale dates. <T3>Comment 17: </T3>Petitioner contends that an adjustment for technicalservice expense incurred on U.S. sales is required. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. In its questionnaire response, HsingKwo misinterpreted the term ``technical service.'' The technical serviceexpenses originally reported by Hsing Kwo with respect to its U.S.saleswere in fact indirect expenses for which no adjustment is warranted whena comparison involves purchase price sales. <T3>Comment 18: </T3>Petitioner contends that specific documents collectedat verification should be released under Administrative Protective Order(APO). <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have released to petitioner, under APO, certainsupplemental submissions collected during verification that contained informationnot previously on the record. As to the verification exhibits, it is ourpolicy not to release a respondent's supporting source documents underan administrative protective order when we have requested this additionalinformation solely to further support a respondent's claim. Release ofsuch documents can be damaging to the competitive position of the respondent.If petitioners did not agree with our position, the proper remedy was toappeal the refusal to release verification exhibits under APO, to the CITwhile this investigation was in progress 19 U.S.C. 1677f(c)(2). <T3>Comment 19: </T3>Petitioner argues that with respect to San Wu, a Taiwanesemanufacturer of the subject merchandise to whom we did not present a questionnaire,and who consequently has not participated in this investigation, the finaldetermination antidumping margin should be based upon ``best informationavailable'' (company specific information from the petition) rather thanthe ``all other rate'' (the weighted average of the margin percentage theDepartment calculates for all questionnaire respondents). In this case,since there is only one questionnaire respondent, Hsing Kwo, the ``allother rate'' is the same as the margin percentage calculated for HsingKwo. Petitioner argues that only if the margin percentage the Departmentcalculates for Hsing Kwo is higher than the rate shown for San Wu in thepetition should the Department assign to San Wu the all other (Hsing Kwo)rate. Petitioner makes this argument due to the affiliation of San Wu withrespondents in the companion investigations involving this same merchandiseimported from Singapore and Japan respectively, and with these respondents'related U.S. importer. Based on the results of our preliminary determinations,petitioner anticipates that the final determination margin percentagescalculated by the Department for San Wu's affiliates in Singapore and Japanwill be higher than the margin percentage the Department calculates forHsing Kwo in the Taiwan investigation, and that consequently, the relatedU.S. importer will have an incentive to shift its sources from Japan orSingapore to avoid any antidumping duty orders imposed on the subject merchandisefrom those countries. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. The Department's policy, as statedin andSection; 353.38 of the Regulations, is to examine at least 60 percentof the exports from any given country under investigation, and to assignthe ``all other'' rate to those products not investigated. The 60 percentminimum was satisfied by Hsing Kwo's exports. Exports of belts producedby San Wu in Taiwan (assuming an antidumping duty order with respect toTaiwan) would be subject to a suspension of liquidation, and the ``allother'' duty deposit rate pending an annual review pursuant to section751 of the Act which would establish antidumping duties due, which maybe more or less than duties deposited at entry of the merchandise. <T3>Comment 20: </T3>Petitioner argues that critical circumstances existwith respect to imports of industrial belts from Taiwan. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. See our discussion of ``Critical Circumstances''above.<T3>Comment 21: </T3>In a letter to the Department dated April 5, 1989,petitioner makes certain allegations regarding Hsing Kwo's U.S. sales data.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Petitioner's comments are untimely, and improperlysummarized in the public version. As such, the Department cannot considerinformation in the petitioner's April 5, 1989 submission. Comments submittedthree working days before the final determination do not allow the Departmentadequate time to properly analyze, or respond to, said comments. Furthermore,the public version of the above submission was improperly prepared; petitionerdeleted the entire second and third pages of a three page submission. Onlypertinent business proprietary information should be deleted or summarizedfrom the public version. <T3>Comment 22: </T3>Petitioner asserts that in its scope of investigationat the preliminary determination, the Department listed only four HTS sub-headings.Petitioner requests that the Department list eighteen HTS sub-headingsin its final determination. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. The petition included nine TSUSA itemnumbers and four HTS sub-headings that petitioner believed would correspondto the TSUSA numbers when the HTS system became effective. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule went into effect on January 1, 1989. Basedon a concordance between TSUSA item numbers and HTS sub-headings listedin a January 1989 USITC publication, <T3>``The Continuity of Import and Export Trade statistics After Implementationof the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System'', </T3>petitionerrequested that the Department expand the four HTS sub-headings listed inour preliminary determination to eighteen sub-headings. We asked for commentsfrom the interested parties in this investigation concerning industrialbelts covered by the eighteen HTS sub-headings. In our preliminary determinations, as now, we note that the written descriptionof the products covered by the investigation is dispositive. The HTS numbersare provided for convenience and customs purposes as to the scope of theproduct coverage. We do not view providing additional HTS sub-headingsas broadening the scope of this investigation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of industrial belts from Taiwan, as defined in the ``Scopeof Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption, on or after the date of publication ofthis notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The U.S. Customs Service shall continue to requirea cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by whichthe foreign market value of the subject merchandise from Taiwan exceedsthe U.S. price as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remainin effect until further notice. The weighted-average margins are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,12</C>  <H1>Manufacturer/producer/exporter </H1><H1>Weighted-average margin percentage</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Hsing Kwo <D>12.13 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All Others <D>12.13</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification </ITAG>In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITCof our determination.
