Caliguiri had no right to do so, the city's legaladviser said Friday.   Councilman Ben Woods, who on Thursday had declared that ``I cando what I want'' because he was the rightful acting councilpresident, said Friday that he would abide by the ruling of citySolicitor Dan Pellegrini saying that it wasn't so.   ``Some members of city council are obviously jockeying forposition,'' Pellegrini said. ``They believe they can get someadvantage out of it.''   Caliguiri, a popular politician who had been mayor since 1977,died May 6 at age 56 of a rare, incurable illness. The city councilpresident, Sophie Masloff, was sworn in as the mayor's successor,and Woods argued that as council president pro tem he shouldautomatically take Mrs. Masloff's job.   Pellegrini said Friday that Mrs. Masloff would retain thecouncil president title but will not exercise those powers, whichinclude appointing committee heads and hiring council employees.   The city council will decide next week who will exercise thosepowers instead, Pellegrini said. Woods said he expected the eightmembers of council, not including Mrs. Masloff, would vote Mondayto hand the reins to him.   ``I'll live with it (Pellegrini's ruling),'' Woods said Friday.``I don't agree with it. ... He's the city solicitor. I'm not goingto challenge it in court.''   Woods began exercising the powers of president the day Caliguiridied. Among other things, he rescinded the $100 fine FinanceCommittee Chairman Mark Pollock had levied against Councilman JimFerlo and the $60 fine against Councilman Jack Wagner. Pollockaccused his two political adversaries of disrupting a committeemeeting.   ``Most concerned citizens were thinking of the mayor and hisfamily,'' Pollock said. ``Ben was thinking about rescinding finesand taking power, which tells a great deal.''   Another critic on the city council, Michelle Madoff, accusedWoods of ``causing a circus.''   ``Here we are, not even a few days after the burial, and Ben'scoming in and dividing us, saying, `I'm in charge. I'm running thisplace.' He hasn't even waited for a legal opinion,'' she saidThursday.   The city charter is vague on the succession issue. Woods citedprecedent for his position. Pellegrini cited precedent and priorsolicitors' opinions for his legal opinion.   Both council president and president pro tem are elected by thecity council. ``Pro tem'' is short for the Latin phrase protempore, which means temporary or temporarily.</TEXT></DOC>
