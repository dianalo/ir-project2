MagneTek said it repaid $258 million in revolving credit and term loans, and redeemed about $55 million in 16.75% notes, 15.25% preferred stock and 15.50% preferred stock.    The repayment was financed by a new $150 million issue of 11.20% senior notes due June 30, 1997, part of a new $150 million credit line, and proceeds from the initial public offering in June, which raised about $60 million.    MagneTek said it has total debt of $386 million. It said it will save about $8 million a year in interest payments and a further $3 million a year in preferred dividend payments. </TEXT></DOC>
