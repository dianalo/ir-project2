The Soviets hope major disagreements in the Strategic ArmsReduction Talks can be settled at a March 22-23 meeting inWashington between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and hisSoviet counterpart Eduard A. Shevardnadze.   ``We remain optimistic,'' said a Soviet diplomat who has beeninvolved in the negotiations in Geneva on long-range weapons. Hespoke only on condition of anonymity.   ``We are near the finishing line,'' he said, and ``there isstill plenty of time'' before Shultz and Shevardnadze meet.   Shultz and Shevardnadze ordered their aides to draft, beforethat March meeting, agreements on three areas: verifyingcompliance, dismantling weapons, and exchanging data on thearsenals.   ``These three drafts constitute the bulk of the work to bedone'' on the treaty, although several major points of disagreementremain, the Soviet official said.   Reagan, in an interview published last Friday by The WashingtonPost, said he did not think it possible to reach an accord beforethe summit, which is expected in late May or early June.   ``We're not at this moment anticipating that it would be readyfor signature then,' Reagan told the Post. But he said the deal waspossible before he leaves office next January.   The proposed treaty would cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 35percent to 50 percent, setting a limit of 6,000 on the overallnumber of warheads with ranges of more than 3,400 miles.   The Soviets are balking at a U.S. demand to limit the number ofwarheads on land-based missiles to 3,300 and the number of warheadsaboard so-called heavy missiles to 1,650, according to U.S.officials.   And the Soviets want to set a limit on numbers of sea-launchedcruise missiles, above the 6,000 warhead ceiling. U.S. officialshave objected to such a limit, in part because it would bedifficult to verify.   The Soviet official repeated a remark by Kremlin leader MikhailS. Gorbachev that technology exists to detect nuclear weaponsaboard naval vessels, a statement that U.S. experts question.   ``Such things as sublimits need to be worked out at the highestpolitical levels,'' such as the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting inMarch, the official said.   ``The bulk of the work, the technical details, is in the threedrafts and needs to be worked out at the expert level'' before thetough political decisions, he said.   The official also said the Kremlin might drop its objections totests in space of Reagan's Star Wars missile defense system if somelimits could be negotiated beforehand.   He said the Soviet Union would countenance some space tests aslong as both sides agreed they did not violate the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.   The diplomat noted that Reagan and Gorbachev agreed at theDecember summit in Washington to abide by the ABM treaty.   But the joint communique issued at summit did not addressU.S.-Soviet disagreement on the extent to which the treatyrestricted space tests of weapons such as lasers and other devicesthat were not in use when the ABM pact was signed.   The Soviets are seeking a U.S. response to their proposal to setlimits on tests for various Star Wars components such as lasers,the official said.   U.S. negotiators have rejected such limits, saying thatcompliance would be impossible to verify in space.</TEXT></DOC>
