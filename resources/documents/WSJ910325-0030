To try to stimulate theeconomy, the Federal Reserve pushed down interest rates moreaggressively, and that further depressed the dollar.   Recently, however, the American economy has begun to looka little better. Preliminary March numbers from theUniversity of Michigan survey show a sharp rise in consumerconfidence, due at least in part to victory in the PersianGulf. At mid-March, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congresshe saw scattered signs of a business pickup and that maybe,for the moment, the Fed should stop trying to reduce interestrates. For these and other reasons, the U.S. dollar has takenan upward bounce. So far, that's well and good, but neitherthe U.S. nor its trading partners would like to see thedollar go much higher.</LP><TEXT>   This is true despite the fact that the dollar now isundervalued. Economists figure that exchange rates should berelated to what various currencies could buy, so they computesomething called purchasing power parity. On that basis, theanalysts at CRT Government Securities Ltd. figure the U.S.dollar is really worth between 1.80 and 2.10 deutsche marksand between 160 and 180 yen, well above the current rates.                                                                                                          Last week the dollar was trading at around 1.64 marks and138 yen. In early February, the U.S. currency had dropped toabout 1.45 marks and around 130 yen.                                                                                                          Purchasing power parity isn't a good guide to a currency'sworth in the short term, but it's a pretty reliable gauge ofwhat will happen to exchange rates in the long run. PPP alsosays something about trade. As long as the dollar's exchangerates stay well below the PPP rates, foreigners will seekbargains in U.S. goods, and the U.S. trade deficit willcontinue to shrink.   Largely because of the continuing rise in U.S. exports,several analysts think a merchandise trade surplus is not toofar away. Economic growth in Europe and Japan is runningfaster than in the U.S., helping to boost demand for Americanexports. The U.S. recession, at the same time, is limitingAmerican demand for imports.   The Bank Credit Analyst, a respected Montreal journal,thinks a surplus is entirely possible within two years. TheU.S. recovery from the current recession is expected to beslow, not the sort of upturn that would spur a large surge ofimports. Even if the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries succeeds in its plan to curb exports, the price ofoil is likely to remain under $20 a barrel. In the fourthquarter of 1990, the price averaged $28 a barrel.   On the export side, there is sure to be a strong rise insales of goods and services to Kuwait, as the Mideast nationrecovers from the Iraqi occupation. Early estimates of theextent of the damage were greatly exaggerated, but thecontracts awarded to American firms are still likely to runinto many billions of dollars. The display of U.S. defensetechnology in the war also will bring in export business. TheU.S. balance of payments also will benefit from transfers offunds from Japan, Germany and other countries to share thecost of the war.                                                                                                          Where does the U.S. go from here? It would like a stable-- but not too strong -- dollar and a strong economy toencourage an inflow of foreign investment. Foreigners lastyear were heavy net sellers of U.S. securities.                                                                                                          Attractive dollar prices for U.S. goods and assets help toease the U.S. problems in trade and saving by stimulatingU.S. exports and reducing domestic purchasing power, whichreduces domestic consumption relative to domestic productionand allows for sufficient capital inflow.   It sounds neat enough, but if trade, investment and othereconomic factors don't produce a low enough exchange rate,the temptation will be to try manipulation, perhaps at one ofthose glamorous international meetings. Even whenmanipulation produces a lower dollar, the analysts at CRTGovernment Securities point out, it creates a lower standardof living in the U.S. It is surely a second-best solution.   Instead of trying to maneuver the exchange rate to anacceptable level, it would be better to increase domesticsaving and thus to reduce the need for capital inflows.That's easy to say but hard to do: By far the largestdissaver in the U.S. is the federal government via its budgetdeficits.   Those international conferences are interesting, in otherwords, but the best solution for the dollar would be for theU.S. to put its financial house in order.</TEXT></DOC>
