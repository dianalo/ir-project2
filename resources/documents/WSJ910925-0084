Shortly after the collapse of last month's coup, aninformal, exploratory offer was made by Yevgeniy Velikhov,vice chairman of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, to sell theU.S. Soviet space hardware. Arthur Dula, president of SpaceCommerce Corp., the American franchise for Soviet spacetechnology, has suggested that one piece of hardware thatmight be available is the Soviet's new Mir-2 space station.</LP><TEXT>   Soviet space infrastructure is world-class. Theirequipment is reliable, reasonably priced and has provenitself on the only testing-ground that matters -- spaceitself. The Russians have been good at precisely what theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration has beenterrible at: patiently building and maintaining theinfrastructure needed to do exploration and research. TheSoviets are plodders; we're sprinters. It seems smarter totake advantage of that difference and integrate theirstrengths into the U.S. space program, so that the U.S. canfocus on its own strengths.   There are three possible scenarios for obtaining a Russianspace station. The cheapest way would be to lease a Mir-2space station core, have the Russians launch it, and employRussians to operate it. In the first year of operations, aRussian could stay aboard to show American astronauts theropes of station-tending, while U.S. scientist-crewmembersconduct their experiments. The Mir-2 is designed for easylink-up of additional science modules with additional power,so the U.S. could lease additional Russian science modules,adapt our own from existing Spacelab components or build newones.   The Russians have an impressive infrastructure to supporttheir space station: supply ships, communications, crewlaunch vehicles. The whole kit and kaboodle would cost around$200 million a year to run plus the cost of leasing the Mir-2-- chicken-feed compared to the $15.7 billion the Bushadministration has requested for NASA's 1992 budget.   The disadvantage of the Mir-2 lease option is that theRussians launch space stations into an inconvenient orbit forAmerican purposes. Apart from that, some people may benervous about the Soviet Union's political instability.   Another option would be to buy the new core Mir-2 moduleoutright. This would cost some $600 or $700 million. (TheSoviets might take payment in grain.) The core could belaunched from the space shuttle into any orbit NASA chose.Then it could be operated from Houston's Mission Control.Some Russian experts could be subcontracted to teach NASA thepeculiarities of their systems, but that would be the extentof their participation. The U.S. and its internationalpartners could launch additional specialized science moduleswith additional power arrays.   With this option, the U.S. could control its own fullyoperational station in a couple of years. The station couldbe used to test and build more advanced systems destined forNASA's Space Station Freedom, or Freedom could be done awaywith altogether. The Russian space infrastructure would beavailable for backup supply and transportation, in caseanother shuttle disaster disrupts U.S. space services.   The option the Russians prefer is to create a U.S.-Soviet&quot;joint stock company&quot; that would own and operate the spacestation. This variation is, I think, doomed. The vastmajority of joint ventures in the Soviet Union have failed --and the more complex the venture, the more prone to failure.Because a joint-stock company is much less simple a businesstransaction than a lease or a sale, it would be vulnerable totoo many political vagaries. In space, the business dealsthat have enjoyed the greatest success are those that haveinvolved quick cash purchases.   The U.S. aerospace industry and NASA have reacteddismissively to the prospect of a lease or purchase of theMir-2 space station. The concerns they have expressed arethese:   -- Buying Russian equipment will reduce U.S.competitiveness and lead to widespread unemployment inaerospace.   But even if Congress were to cancel Space Station Freedomtomorrow, only one-eighth of NASA's budget would be affected.There would still be plenty of aerospace jobs available ifthe U.S. bought and operated the Mir-2, although they wouldgo to operations contractors and scientists rather thanconstruction contractors. Even the construction contractorsneed not be hurt: They could be assigned the task of adaptingor building scientific modules for use on the Mir-2 core.   If Congress keeps NASA funding at current levels, usingthe Mir-2 instead of Freedom would mean there would be enoughmoney to operate a space station and still fund work on spacescience, advanced propulsion systems, advanced robotics,microclimate management and a whole host of other space goalsthat would otherwise have to wait 10 years. Buying a Mir-2could energize the American aerospace industry, by putting itinto space station operations many years earlier.   -- We don't know who to deal with over there.   The Russians have established franchises world-wide tosell space equipment and services. It's important to notethat the shake-ups in the Soviet Union have been at the top,not in aerospace industry. And the failure of the coup hasremoved many KGB, party and military officials opposed tocommercialization. It would, however, be helpful if BorisYeltsin would consolidate Russia's competing spacebureaucracies into one agency.   -- Money is not the issue in building a space station --the reason for doing it is to learn how to do it.   Money is, was and always will be a fundamental issue withthe space station or any other taxpayer-supported program.Who in the public wants to subsidize NASA's learning curve --which in recent years has included such expensive failures asthe Hubble telescope, the Galileo and the GOES-NEXT weathersystem? The idea that all your technology must be home-grownis a dumb excuse for the &quot;not invented here&quot; syndrome theNASA bureaucracy has displayed in such abundance lately.After World War II, the U.S. was only too happy to use Germantalent and German methods in the early rocket programs andlater, in the magnificent Apollo moon program. Why should itbe different with Russian talent at the end of the Cold War?It is an American tradition to assimilate foreign advancesand to welcome talent, whatever the origin.   About $70 billion of U.S. space projects planned for thenext decade duplicates equipment the Russians have in theirinventory today. The U.S. should be looking over the SovietEnergiya heavy launch vehicle and the Biosat system, alongwith Soviet escape vehicles, supply vehicles, advanced spacesuits and recycling systems.   And if any deal can be struck, there will be a politicalbonus to the economic and technical benefits. Turning theRussians into trading partners would be infinitely better forthe world than letting them collapse into beggary. Beggarnations resent what they get, demand more and eventuallyrebel. And this beggar nation will possess the biggestnuclear arsenal and largest standing army in the world.Building trade with a proud nation will be a lot cheaper thanappeasing NASA's vanity and fear of change.   ---   Mrs. Oberg is co-author of &quot;Pioneering Space: Living onthe Next Frontier&quot; (McGraw-Hill, 1986).</TEXT></DOC>
