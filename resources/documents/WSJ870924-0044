Yesterday's session &quot;wasn't a sparkler, but the ability of stocks to extend their gains is encouraging,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, a market strategist with Prudential-Bache.    Gains were fairly broad, with advancing stocks outnumbering decliners, 1,010 to 605, on the New York Stock Exchange. On the American Stock Exchange, the ratio was 368 up to 261 down. In over-the-counter trading monitored by Nasdaq, 1,273 stocks rose and 1,028 fell.    Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with 220.3 million shares changing hands, up from 209.5 million Tuesday, when the industrial average rose 75.23 points. The market stayed in plus territory almost all day, mostly ebbing and flowing between a 10-point and 20-point advance in the industrial average.    Since Monday, the average has regained about 92 points of the 259 points it lost during the past month's correction.    Broader market averages also showed respectable but unspectacular gains. The New York Stock Exchange index was up 1.05 to 179.53, the American Stock Exchange index up 1.98 to 353.31, and the Nasdaq composite index up 2.80 to 440.70.    &quot;It's clear to me that we have seen the low,&quot; said Robert S. Robbins, a market strategist with Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. He called Tuesday's big rally a &quot;kickoff day&quot; for a new advance.    As usual in the past month or so, most traders and investors were focusing on the outlook for the dollar, inflation and interest rates.    Mr. Robbins thinks investors' recent jitters about the dollar were excessive. &quot;I think the dollar has bottomed,&quot; he said. &quot;It's in no one's interest for the dollar to go to new lows.&quot; The dollar's recent weakness has hurt stocks by creating fears of higher inflation and interest rates. A weak dollar makes imports more expensive, giving U.S. manufacturers room to raise prices. And it makes foreigners worried about investing in the U.S., causing them to demand a higher return to do so.    Early in yesterday's session, the government announced that the Consumer Price Index was up 0.5% in August, which was worse than expected. The government also said durable goods orders dropped 3.1% in August. Some traders said that means the economy isn't overheating, so there may be little need for the Federal Reserve Board to tighten credit further.    Fredric E. Russell, a money manager in Tulsa, Okla., thinks oil prices will soon drop, helping the inflation picture. &quot;The market's preoccupation with inflation is unwarranted,&quot; he said. &quot;At worst, we are seeing only the suggestion of an inflationary trend.&quot; He expects Mideast tensions to ease before long, reasoning that Iran and Iraq &quot;have just about exhausted themselves.&quot;    But not everyone is sanguine, as stock prices remain very high by many standard yardsticks. &quot;The value in the market is very slim,&quot; said Geraldine Weiss, editor of Investment Quality Trends, a La Jolla, Calif., newsletter. &quot;It looks as if this might be an opportunity to sell, a chance to sell into strength.&quot;    And Hal Marlow, president of Market Timing Associates, an investment advisory firm in Largo, Fla., thinks that the industrial average's recent low of 2492 &quot;will be broken, and quickly.&quot; He notes that Tuesday's big move in the blue-chip stocks didn't sweep middle-sized and smaller stocks along in great numbers.    Cyclical stocks generally did well yesterday. Among steelmakers, Inland Steel rose 1 1/4 to 33 1/2 and USX was up 1/2 to 37 1/8. Bethlehem, whose debt issues Standard andamp; Poor's is considering upgrading, slipped 1/8 to 16 1/8.    Most paper companies showed gains. International Paper was up 1 1/2 to 50 3/8, Kimberly-Clark up 1 1/2 to 58 and Mead up 1 7/8 to 44 3/8.    Specialty retailers continued to take it on the chin, following disappointing projections last week on earnings at Gap and Limited. Gap shares dropped 1 to 36 5/8, Limited fell 1 1/8 to 35 7/8 and Liz Claiborne fell 3/4 to 27 3/4.    Affiliated Publications jumped 4 5/8 to 69 7/8. Last week the company said it would have a one-time gain of $3.40 a share from its share of the public offering of McCaw Cellular Communications. Affiliated owns 44% of McCaw Communications, parent of McCaw Cellular.    Monsanto advanced 4 1/4 to 93 1/4. Morgan Stanley analysts Paul Brooke and Paul Leming disseminated a favorable comment on the company's drug subsidiary, G.D. Searle. They concluded that Monsanto wouldn't need to acquire another pharmaceutical company and so would have plenty of cash available for a possible share buy-back.    Trinova, a fluid power and plastics concern in Maumee, Ohio, leapt 4 1/8 to 44 1/4 on volume of 665,900 shares. Wall Street analysts said they couldn't explain the big move, and a company spokesman said, &quot;There's no news out of here,&quot; though he added that the company has had &quot;pretty good order trends the past couple of months, which have been well received by analysts.&quot;    Lamaur gained 2 1/4 to 28 1/8. Dow Chemical said it had agreed to acquire Lamaur for $28.50 a share, subject to approval of Lamaur's holders. Lamaur has been trying to fend off a hostile takeover offer of $24 a share from Alberto-Culver, which withdrew its bid yesterday. Dow Chemical rose 3/8 to 101 1/2; Alberto-Culver fell 1/8 to 24 1/2.    The largest percentage loser on the Big Board was Radice, a real estate development company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., down 3/4 to 3 1/2. The company missed interest payments on some of its bonds and loan agreements this month, and officials had said in July that they might try to sell all or parts of the company.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific, which announced late Tuesday that it plans to buy as many as 60 million of its 157 million common shares outstanding, rose 1 7/8 to 58 7/8. Shares of Burlington Northern gained 4 1/8 to 76 7/8, as the Santa Fe announcement focused favorable attention on railroads that some analysts consider undervalued.
