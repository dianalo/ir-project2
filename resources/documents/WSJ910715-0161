ATime International special report discovers &quot;Shock and Angst&quot;in the East. Reuters has the German economy &quot;poised on therazor's edge.&quot;   But these predominately dismal accounts deserve a bit ofleavening. After all, angst is a chronic condition forBerliners. It is born out of 40 years of living at GroundZero of the Cold War. It won't be relieved when Berlin onceagain becomes Germany's capital and the center of itsturbulent politics. Indeed, much of today's doom and gloom ispolitical, propagated by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) tosuggest that reunification has been badly managed byChristian Democratic Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Possibly so, butit's doubtful that the SPD could have avoided one majorproblem: the huge subsidies that are straining the federalbudget.</LP><TEXT>   The standard forecast for Germany still envisions some 3%growth and 3% inflation in 1991 -- not bad in today's worldeconomy. Germans, like Americans, worry a lot even in thebest of times. It may be a sign that the political system isworking, with issues being debated and a fighting chance ofgood policies emerging.   To be sure, East Germany's reconstruction has broughtunemployment and is shaking up old patterns of life that somehad accepted. But it is not stalled. Broken down factoriesare being closed. Massively inefficient industrial kombinatsare being broken up and sold off in pieces. Small businessesare sprouting; over a million applications to start new firmshave been filed. Chancellor Kohl estimates that a million newjobs have been created by small businesses so far. For anyonewho understands that economies are built from the ground up,not the top down, that is a sign of vitality.   The person who best understands this transformation isBirgit Breuel, the 53-year-old president of Treuhandanstalt(Trusteeship Institute). THA assumed ownership of nearly allproperty in eastern Germany when the Communist systemcollapsed and has been assigned by Bonn to sell, restructureor shut down existing enterprises. THA's executives sufferedno illusions about how easy that would be and hence today&quot;are not nearly as nervous as some people are in westernGermany,&quot; says Mrs. Breuel.   In fact, privatization is going reasonably well. &quot;In May,we sold 544 companies, which is quite a lot for one month,&quot;says Mrs. Breuel. &quot;In the whole year 1990, we only sold 400,so it really has speeded up.&quot; Among the 70 or so sizableforeign companies that have picked up former East Germanproperties are such blue chips as Coca Cola, Procter andamp;Gamble, Asea Brown Boveri, AKZO of Holland, British Gas andSaint-Gobain of France. Foreign investors are proceedingcautiously -- Mrs. Breuel warns them that they have to thinklike pioneers because of an inadequate infrastructure andother special problems -- but they are proceedingnonetheless, as are, of course, major western Germancompanies.   THA's business has picked up partly because Germanychanged its privatization law after seeing how much delaycould be caused if it tried to deal with some 1 millionwestern claims to the property in THA's hands that eitherNazis or Communists had seized. Under the change, Bonn toldTHA to go ahead and sell properties if there is a valid offerand to give the buyer clear title. Claims will be dealt withseparately. Claimants will not necessarily recover the actualproperty seized from them or their ancestors.   In addition to 2,140 large properties, THA has sold some20,000 small items, such as retail shops, hotels, pharmaciesand cinemas, to private buyers.&quot;If you have a better retailshop, if you have a better hotel, if you have a nice cinemaaround the corner, this really can change lives,&quot; says Mrs.Breuel.   Construction business is picking up as big governmentinfrastructure projects get underway, and a new servicesector is developing. &quot;We didn't have anything like tourism,or insurance or banking business here before,&quot; says Mrs.Breuel.   There is a lag from the time workers are laid off byfactories and their movement into these new industries. Somewho can't adapt themselves won't make it at all. But Mrs.Breuel notices a small return flow of easterners who hadmigrated to West Germany in search of jobs -- so clearlyopportunities are opening up even as old jobs are lost.   Nowhere is that more obvious than in the halls of the vastbuilding THA occupies just east of where the Berlin wallstood less than a year ago. This building was onceheadquarters for World War II Luftwaffe chieftain HermannGoering and more recently housed a Communist ministry. Today,most of the people in the halls and offices look young. Andthat's no doubt because this is a good place for ambitiousyoung Germans to get in on the ground floor of the easternrenaissance.   Michael Ensser, who handles press relations for Mrs.Breuel, has been at THA since only January, but by comparisonwith some of his colleagues, he is a veteran. That's becauseof the opportunities for upward mobility. After THA employeesanalyze the business plans eastern German enterprises arerequired to submit, they are experts on those companies, andhence prime material for managerial jobs when the companiesare privatized.   &quot;It is a great opportunity for people my age,&quot; says Mr.Ensser. &quot;In the West, we would have to wait much longer forthese kinds of jobs.&quot; In short, what Mr. Ensser feels is notangst but the elation at being a young man engaged in anunprecedented venture -- what THA calls in its publicitybrochures the &quot;Sale of the Century.&quot;   Indeed, that may well be too modest. It is hard to thinkof any example in all of history of such a sweeping sale ofbusiness assets. So far THA has investment commitmentsamounting to $62.6 billion. In unit terms, its supply ofproperties actually has been growing as it splits up some ofthe larger firms. Whereas early reports said THA probablywould have some 8,000 properties to sell, it now has some10,000 after sales already completed.   None of this is to say that German reunification has noproblems. Unemployment certainly is one. The government'shuge subsidy burden, which prompted it to raise taxes, isanother. And there is a disturbing emergence among youngGermans of neo-Nazi tendencies, suggesting that the oldnihilism that has caused Germany so much trouble has notquite been laid to rest.   But even if the east is not poised for anotherwirtschaftswunder it is changing every day, with new andbetter jobs being created as old ones are being lost. A new,young managerial class is rising and some of the old managersof the defunct socialist state are learning new ways. The newGermany, angst and all, will probably make it.</TEXT></DOC>
