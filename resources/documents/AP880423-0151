(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker renewed his call Saturday tobe allowed to return to PTL to help erase its debts, but ministryofficials blamed the former television evangelist for therevocation of its tax-exempt status and other financial problems.   The Internal Revenue Service revoked PTL's exemption Friday andsaid contributions to the organization were no longer taxdeductible.   The IRS said Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker and their aides profitedexcessively from donations to the ministry. The agency also saidmuch of PTL's Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill was commercialrather than ministerial.   Bakker, in a telephone call to The Associated Press from hishome in Palm Springs, Calif., acknowledged that he made mistakes,but he denied taking excessive profits and said contributions heconvinced people to send built PTL's evangelical empire.   ``It's typical of the IRS. They throw everything at you but thekitchen sink and then ask you to sort it out with documents andvouchers and receipts and defend yourself,'' Bakker said.   Bakker said PTL faces liquidation, so its current leadershipshould give him another chance.   ``Now that it's reached the end of the line and will be brokenup, what do they have to lose,'' Bakker said.   Bakker resigned as leader of the ministry in March 1987 in themidst of a scandal over his sexual encounter with former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn in 1980.   PTL trustee David Clark has said he has no intention of lettingBakker return.   Ministry officials probably will announce on Monday's ``PTLClub'' television show their response to the IRS action, PTLattorney Bradford Leggett said.   If PTL appeals, contributions by individuals would be deductibleup to $1,000 until the appeal is decided, the IRS said.   ``This ruling could have an impact on contributions if peopledon't keep their focus on the fact that what we are dealing withhere is a legacy that was left by the Bakkers,'' Leggett said.   PTL has applied for a new tax-exempt charter and wants tolegally separate its ministry functions _ the daily TV show,satellite network and Heritage Village Church _ from its theme parkand hotel. There was no indication when the IRS would rule.   The IRS says PTL owes more than $55 million in taxes from June1983 to June 1987, the month PTL filed for protection fromcreditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court because of $72 million in otherdebts..   Meanwhile, the Rev. Jerry Falwell on Saturday criticized the IRSruling as a ``knee-jerk reaction'' that ``has guaranteed the demiseof the ministry.''   Falwell, who headed PTL briefly after Bakker stepped down, saidin a speech to the North Carolina Associated Press BroadcastersAssociation that the IRS should have revoked PTL's exemption onlyfor the years Bakker headed the ministry.</TEXT></DOC>
