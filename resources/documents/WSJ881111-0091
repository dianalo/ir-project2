In the rush to own big consumer stocks, the real or presumed targets of takeovers, investors are shunning industrial and technology companies. But some Wall Street analysts suggest they do so at their own peril.    &quot;People making big bets in the consumer sector are taking a big risk,&quot; warns Peter Canelo, a market strategist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;When you have big divergencies like this, they tend to be corrected with the expensive tier suffering the most.&quot;    The two tiers are evident in the way the market values consumer and industrial stocks. While the price of the overall stock market is between 12 and 13 times annual earnings, Mr. Canelo says the much-sought consumer stocks are trading at about 16 times earnings. The industrial sector, meanwhile, is priced at about nine times earnings.    &quot;Not since the early '70s, when the blue chips were the only place to be, have we had such a marked divergence in the market,&quot; he says.    Charles Clough, the chief portfolio strategist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says consumer stocks have been overvalued since late 1980, and the recent boom in takeover activity has merely exaggerated the gap between the consumer and industrial areas. He also maintains that consumer companies are going to be hard-pressed to keep their profit margins intact.    &quot;The profit margins are very, very high, and the presumption is nothing can go wrong,&quot; he says. &quot;But that's asking for trouble.&quot;    The net result is that both analysts recommend that conservative investors place their bets on the industrial stocks. &quot;It's going to be hard to make much money in the consumer sector,&quot; says Mr. Clough. &quot;We think the values are in the industrial companies, specifically the capital goods stocks.&quot;    Adds Mr. Canelo: &quot;I think some of the hated technology and industrial companies are going to become a refuge.&quot;    Both analysts agree the gap is bound to close. One factor that will help close it is the recent stability of the dollar. For the past few years, many of the big consumer companies have had big earnings boosts from the effect of a weakening dollar on their profits earned abroad. The weaker dollar makes overseas profits more valuable in dollar terms.    But unless the dollar takes a big plunge before year end, fourth-quarter results for those companies will actually suffer because the dollar now is slightly stronger than it was a year ago.    Industrial companies, on the other hand, benefit in the longer term from a dollar that has stabilized at lower levels. The reason: The currency makes U.S.-made products cheaper abroad, boosting exports. Increased exports keep U.S. factories humming and bolster the earnings of industrial companies. In fact, recently reported third-quarter earnings show industrial companies posting an 18% increase in profits -- despite sluggish economic growth. Meanwhile, earnings for the overall market were up only 12%.    Messrs. Canelo and Clough's predictions of higher earnings for industrial companies are supported by a study of third-quarter results done by Zacks Investment Research Inc., which surveys analysts' earnings estimates. According to the study, some of the biggest positive earnings surprises were turned in by industrial companies, including automobile manufacturers and makers of aluminum, specialty steel and other metals.    Mr. Canelo also is betting that takeover and buy-out activity, the main prop under the high prices of many consumer stocks, is going to start ebbing soon. He says a warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who recently cautioned banks to review their buy-out lending, is &quot;going to make some institutions more cautious about chasing hot consumer stocks.&quot;    ---                     Earnings Surprises   Actual third quarter earnings compared with analysts' previous estimates, ranked by industry groups with largest percentage increases.
