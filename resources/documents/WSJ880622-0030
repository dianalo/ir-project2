Japan's Sanyo Electric Co. bought the place from fumbling American owners and in no time increased production and employment, cut defects, and started raking in the profits. The national news media raced to the scene.    Today, Japanese-owned factories are commonplace in America, and their success is presumed. Japan's assembly-line work ethic and the mysteries of Japanese management have been so thoroughly dissected that outsiders don't come around here much anymore.    Just as well. Only 350 employees work at the plant now; more than 2,000 used to. It will roll up something like a $28 million loss this fiscal year, on top of $40 million in losses over the past three years. In March, a microwave-oven production line added in the salad days was shut down, and only two of nine television lines now operate, as some production has moved to Mexico. Of three dozen or so Japanese executives originally here, 10 remain.    &quot;We don't know, to tell you the truth, if {the company is} going to be here this fall,&quot; says Trent Bonner McCollum, the publisher of the town newspaper.    Sanyo says it isn't quitting yet. But as Japanese plants and ventures in the U.S. multiply -- tripling since 1981 -- one thing is becoming clear. Some of the problems that have bedeviled domestic manufacturers can vex newly arrived Japanese companies, too. More and more of them are finding the American market rife with risk.    Sure, successes still far outnumber setbacks. But Japan's struggles in the U.S. often escape notice because the Japanese &quot;are very reluctant to admit a mistake once they've made a deal,&quot; says Paul Aron, retired vice chairman of Daiwa Securities America Inc. Most Japanese ventures are also cloaked in privacy, so &quot;management may be terrible, but you won't know there are problems until far down the road,&quot; says Michael Kane, director of the U.S.-Japan International Management Institute at the University of Kentucky.    &quot;You only hear about the good ones,&quot; declares Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department trade negotiator, who contends that Japanese management superiority is sometimes as much public-relations hype as reality.    Problems occur most often when Japanese companies buy existing U.S. operations. Unlike start-up facilities, where a company begins from scratch with new technology and malleable, young and nonunion employees, existing plants sometimes shackle new owners with baggage left behind. Frequently, that includes -- as it did here -- discord between previously unhappy unions and a new management uncertain about what to do with them.    &quot;Much of the success we attribute to the Japanese mystique reflects green-field investment and a young work force,&quot; says Harley Shaiken, a labor expert and a professor at the University of California at San Diego.    At the beginning of this year, Japanese manufacturers were involved in at least 672 U.S. operations, and new construction outnumbered acquisitions 2 to 1. But as the surging yen pressures the Japanese to speed development of American bases, there are more takeovers, buy-outs and joint ownerships of existing operations.    Last year, Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals Inc. surprised many with a $540 million takeover of Reichhold Chemicals Inc. And in March, Bridgestone Corp., Japan's largest tire maker, beat out Italy's Pirelli S.p.A. of Italy for Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co. with a breathtaking $2.6 billion offer.    As they buy American companies, the Japanese sometimes buy headaches, too. Tokyo's NKK Corp., which acquired half of National Steel Corp. a few years ago, now spends time helping it wrestle with labor issues and line up financing for modernization. Nisshin Steel recently had to watch its U.S. partner, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., file for bankruptcy protection. Mr. Prestowitz recalls counseling a small Japanese noodle company in California that was &quot;going bananas&quot; because its Japanese manager spoke no English and because it had a Chinese sales manager and a Hispanic work force. (He recommended adding some American managers.)    What follows is a look at two significant Japanese forays into U.S. manufacturing that have made their new investors work a lot harder than suggested by the lore. One is the early plunge by Sanyo into electronics. The other is the more recent, and much larger, effort by Japan's NKK to penetrate the American steel industry.    Euphoria reigned in Forrest City after Sanyo took charge of a Warwick Electronics Inc. plant in 1977. Employment had been skidding, and the television sets being made for Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. were suffering both from Japanese competition and from their own quality problems.    Here was Sanyo, pouring in capital and engineering talent. It rehired hundreds of cast-off workers. It set high quality standards, yet embraced the local union and sponsored outings for employees and townspeople. Inside, it even painted the floor with polyurethane paint so dust could be cleaned up easily.    For a while, things were great. Production jumped fifteen-fold. Both Sears and Sanyo brands streamed off the lines. Sanyo heaped praise on the teamwork and spirit of its workers, and the born-again plant came to symbolize the superiority of Japanese management. &quot;An important development in labor relations and industrial rebirth,&quot; glowed one major newspaper.    The miracle was a mirage. &quot;If anything, it was a victory for technology,&quot; reflects Darrell Carter, the operations vice president. Initial productivity and sales gains were real enough but mostly reflected use of high-grade Japanese-made components that were easy to assemble and reduced rejects. Later, the addition of microwave ovens added to production activity.    Actually, things weren't so hot right from the start. Forrest City is a half-black, half-white community of 13,803, situated 90 miles east of Little Rock amid fields of wheat and soybeans. And things change slowly. Its first integrated high-school prom made headlines just last month.    So with blacks and whites still sorting out their relationships, the arrival of a clutch of Japanese executives -- and some alien management concepts -- was a shock. Townspeople say the problem wasn't hostility but poor communications.    Sanyo initially wanted to import quality circles, calisthenics and company uniforms, but it backed off. Tanemichi Sohma, a retired Sanyo vice president, recalls, &quot;The union would have just thought we were trying to brainwash them.&quot;    Sanyo tried consensus management with an operating committee of three Americans and three Japanese. But only one Sanyo executive spoke fluent English, so every meeting required an interpreter. After two years, Sanyo retreated to a Japanese president and senior vice president and a mix of Japanese and Americans below that. The top Japanese increasingly relied on the American managers. &quot;They finally said, 'Here's what we want. You go out and do it,'&quot; recalls one.    Tensions exploded in 1985, with the second strike in six years by the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers. The first strike in 1979 was thought to reflect leftover problems and a cultural miscalculation by Sanyo officials. They pleaded with workers not to strike. That &quot;was like telling us they'd give us anything we wanted,&quot; says one union official.    But by 1985, Sanyo, fearing an industry shakeout, was on a tough tack. It demanded medical-insurance cuts, seniority-system changes, and the right to shift workers from job to job. Employees were angry over the death of one worker in a fall and the firing of the union president.    A violent three-week strike was punctuated by stone-throwing, tire-slashing and charges of an attempted firebombing. Some managers and nonstrikers taunted pickets. Police arrested 39 persons.    The strike left the Japanese bitter and disillusioned. &quot;How could we survive if the workers wouldn't help us?&quot; asks Mr. Sohma, the retired official. &quot;With the union, no matter what we do, it was not enough for them. It got to be so difficult, the attitude was to heck with them.&quot;    Japanese executives currently at the plant decline to be interviewed. Sanyo's American managers say too much was made of Sanyo's role in the first place and too much has been made of the strike since. They blame import competition for the plant's decline. Unlike townspeople who think the plant is as good as dead, they hold out hope that Sanyo will transfer in some high-tech production.    When NKK spent $292 million in 1984 for a half-stake in America's No. 6 steelmaker, Pittsburgh-based National Steel, some feared a combine so mighty it would threaten other U.S. steelmakers.    And within a year, National boldly announced it was bent on becoming a world-lass steel company. It had a five-year plan to improve quality and halve the labor in a ton of its steel. It would spend $1 billion on modernization and introduce a new era of labor-management relations.    Four years later the only people sweating are at NKK and National. Despite running at 100% of capacity in the best steel market in a decade, the company ranks dead last among big steelmakers in profitability per ton shipped.    Problems quickly surfaced in the executive suite. To manage National, NKK and National's parent, National Intergroup Inc., set up a management triumvirate for joint decision-making. It didn't work. Robert McBride, National's blunt-talking president, went into early retirement after NKK complained of slow progress and of his reluctance to share authority.    Mr. McBride, now a business consultant, says he just wasn't comfortable being responsible to two different owners. But others say he chafed at the tortoise-like pace of his partners' decision-making. &quot;He was the boss, and he just froze the Japanese out,&quot; says one official and friend.    NKK strengthened its hold under the next president, Kokichi Hagiwara, an NKK senior managing director. But the troika system still didn't work. So, National set up a nine-member management committee more attuned to the Japanese style.    The linchpin of National's plan was to cut 3,500 people from its 11,680 white- and blue-collar employment. That meant flexible job assignments, retraining workers and a fundamental change in its labor contract. In 1986, National signed a radical contract that guaranteed no layoffs and promised profit-sharing even if the company had losses. The union would work toward reforming work rules, combining jobs and shrinking crews.    Company and union alike envisioned a &quot;cooperative partnership&quot; in which steelworkers and foremen, bound by a common interest, would meet monthly to work out jobs and figure out cheaper ways to do things. It was the American industry's version of Japanese quality circles.    Two years into the 39-month contract, union locals have fought the more painful provisions, and the team culture imagined hasn't materialized. The quality circles often aren't held or even scheduled. When they are, they may be sparsely attended and &quot;people just get up and go through the motions,&quot; says David Dowling, president of Local 30 at Granite City, Ill.    The no-layoff provision, which hints at Japan's fabled lifetime employment, also didn't impress workers for long, especially when demand has them working flat out. &quot;Once people have employment security, it's not worth anything any longer,&quot; says Richard Coffee, a National vice president. Mr. Dowling, the union leader, admits, &quot;The old us vs. them is still there.&quot;    Under the contract, National's work force has fallen a mere 233 positions. If a severe downturn comes, the no-layoff policy would create a flood of red ink. &quot;It could destroy the company,&quot; says Mr. Coffee.    Despite all their woes, NKK officials say they still expect National to be America's premier steelmaker one day. &quot;I think we now are on the right track,&quot; says Mr. Hagiwara. And they insist they made a sound move by buying in.    But one investment banker who recently took a new investment proposal to NKK and was spurned isn't so sure. &quot;They said they had a lot more money to spend on National Steel,&quot; he says.    ---   Japanese-Affiliated Manufacturers in U.S.       YEAR-     MAJORITY-     MINORITY       END         OWNED      INTEREST     TOTAL   1981-83           278            20       298   1984              321            27       348   1985              391            34       425   1986              491            48       539   1987              624a           --b       --b   a -- Estimated   b -- Minority-interest companies not estimated for 1987   Source: Japan Economic Institute</TEXT></DOC>
