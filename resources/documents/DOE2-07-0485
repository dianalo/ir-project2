Following are the results of their {gamma}-ray irradiationtests. (1) In the SM type fibers, the loss increment with time is similarto those in the multi-mode fibers SI and GI types. (2) In the Ge dopedcore fiber there appears photo-bleach effect. (3) In the Ge doped corefiber, the loss is proportional to the irradiation dose, there beinglittle dependence on the dose rate. (4) In the pure quartz core fiber,there appears large dose-rate dependence up to about 10/sup 4/ R. (Mori,K.).</TEXT></DOC>
