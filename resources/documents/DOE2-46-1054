The simulation of ground combat requiresrepresentation of combat units, unit activities, command and control,and terrain. This simulation model emphasizes command and control withparticular attention to the potential for automating operational planning.As terrain analysis is an essential part of Army operational planning,this has direct influence on the representation of terrain. The availabilityof digitized terrain makes it feasible to apply computer based techniquesto emulate the terrain analysis process for use in the planning cycle.This paper describes processes used to calculate relevant terrain featuresfor use in a simulation model. 13 refs., 6 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
