(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>This is the sixth part of a series on IBM's midrange computer family, theAS/400, a pivotal part of IBM's strategy to provide enhanced consistency andconnectivity across multiple supported environments.andM;The integrated architecture of the AS/400 is the key to itsapplication-enabling environment.andP;  The major system functions are integratedas part of the machine, rather than being implemented as layers of software.andO;These functions include database management, object addressing, security anddevice-independence.andP;  The high degree of integration isolates theapplications developer from physical implementation details, and providessupport for the major application functions.andP;  In effect, much of thegroundwork traditionally associated with an application is already providedby the system.andM;The high-level interface of the AS/400 provides access to the machine througha single set of operations incorporated into the operating system.andP;  Theinterface is implemented by a single command language.andP;  There are no separatecontrol languages for programmers, operators or job control.andM;No Conversion Process NeededandM;The high-level interface isolates applications developers from machineimplementations; this approach accommodates changes in the machine'sunderlying technology without any impact on applications.andP;  In effect,applications developed on current models of the AS/400 will be able to takeadvantage of new technologies without requiring a conversion process.andM;A single, integrated operating system, OS/400, follows the design concepts ofthe machine and provides a simple interface to its underlying functions.andP;  Theoperating system accommodates three distinct operating environments:System/36, System/38 and AS/400.andP;  These environments present a differentinterface to system functions, but for the most part they share a commonimplementation.andP;  This allows applications programmers with differingSystem/3X backgrounds to be productive immediately.andM;Similarly, the AS/400 command language provides a single consistent interfaceto the operating system's facilities.andP;  It's simple to learn, employing afamiliar structure based on a &quot;verb, object, modifier&quot; syntax, and it has avery powerful prompting facility.andM;Applications developers can write their own commands to perform specificfunctions.andP;  These user-written commands use the same command-processingfacilities as operating-system commands.andP;  The ability to create commandsprovides an enormous benefit to applications programmers.andP;  Commands can beintegrated with application programs by executing them directly from within aprogram.andM;The AS/400 provides a high level of integration of system features, asillustrated in the diagram.andP;  The necessary functions for an integratedapplications-development environment are available on the machine; to datethey haven't been integrated at the developer level.andM;The central element of any application is its data.andP;  As shown in the diagram,all database management is integrated with the AS/400 architecture.andP;  Thisprovides efficient performance for the information system because theoperations are performed below the machine-interface level in a combinationof microcode and hardware.andP;  In addition, the integrity of data is guaranteedby the integration of security at the object level.andM;The database implementation supports the relational data model.andP;  The twomajor components of the database are physical and logical files.andP;  A physicalfile contains the actual data in records or tables, each having the samefield attributes and record length.andP;  Logical files provide alternative viewsof the database and can be created dynamically.andM;Programming InterfaceandM;The AS/400 provides support for such procedural languages as COBOL, FORTRAN,Pascal, PL/I, BASIC and RPG to define individual application programs.andP;  Allthe utilities needed to create screen and report definitions and to definethe database are integrated into a single IBM product, ApplicationDevelopment Tools.andM;The variety of comprehensive end-user tools available from both IBM andthird-party vendors is growing, building on a base first established for theS/38.andP;  These include information-retrieval systems and decision-supportsystems, in addition to IBM's OfficeVision product for the AS/400.andP;  Many ofthe available products provide some basic file-maintenance capability and theability to interface to such popular PC programs as Lotus 1-2-3.andM;IBM has identified CSP as the primary fourth-generationapplications-development language to be supported within Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA).andP;  An execution-only version of CSP is expected to beavailable for the AS/400 sometime this year.andM;The applications-development approach used in most AS/400 environmentsconsists largely of third-generation techniques, with consideration paid tosome of the integration facilities provided as part of the operating system.andO;This is largely the result of a need to maintain older application systemsand a devotion by midrange users (particularly System/36 and System/38) toIBM products, which have so far not addressed fourth-generation developmentconcepts.andM;The more advanced AS/400 installations and first-time users are adopting amore pragmatic approach to applications development.andP;  This approach focuseson the use of generic application packages, applications generators, end-usercomputing and adherence to SAA standards.andM;Generic application packages provide a customized application.andP;  There aremore than 8,000 application packages already available for the AS/400.andM;A growing number of integrated development tools are becoming available forthe AS/400, including Synon from Synon Ltd., Genesis V from Sofbro Ltd.,andO;Geode from SPS International, Lansa from Aspect Computing Pty.andP;  Ltd. andMetaview System Software from Metafile Information Systems.andP;  All of these aredeveloped outside IBM.andP;  Synon recently announced that IBM will market theSynon product under the IBM Cooperative Software Program.andM;Development StrategyandM;Future applications will be developed independently of the target platform.andO;The implementation of distributed applications and cooperative-processingapplications, exploiting the capabilities of various architectures, willbecome increasingly important.andP;  For example, the use of a network ofintelligent workstations attached to a host database server will provideadditional processing power while maintaining central control of the data.andO;The availability of the integrated relational database on the AS/400 providesstrong support for a data-oriented approach to design.andM;As a result of its integrated functions, the AS/400 provides afourth-generation platform for applications developers today.andP;  We can expectto see this philosophy extended beyond the hardware level with the evolutionof more integrated applications-development tools that will address allaspects of the application life cycle.andP;  Most likely, SAA-compliantcomputer-aided software engineering tools, utilizing a common designrepository, will be implemented on desktop workstations attached todistributed networks of computers.andP;  These tools may be used to developapplications that support common user interfaces, common programminginterfaces, connectivity, cooperative processing and distributed data acrossmultiple environments.andM;Next week, I'll review applications-development tools that are available forthe AS/400 environment.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;
