It was the first quarterly profit posted by the quasi-private Federal Asset Disposition Association, which was formed in late 1985 with $25 million in Bank Board funds to manage and sell off the assets of failed thrifts.    In a recent report, the House Banking Committee staff denounced the association as &quot;an organization out of control&quot; and as a costly failure. It had losses of $3 million in 1986 and $7 million last year, according to an association spokesman.    But in a statement yesterday, Gerald Carmen, the association's president, denied that the association is insolvent and needs an infusion of Bank Board funds. </TEXT></DOC>
