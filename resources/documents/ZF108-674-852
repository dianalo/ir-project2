(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Borland likes to see itself as the populariser of esoteric languages for thecommon programmer.andP;  Before Turbo Pascal, the Pascal language was aneducational tool, running on college mainframes and the occasional Apple.andO;The few PC translators that existed huffed and puffed to produce greasy,corpulent object code that sometimes ran almost as fast as the BASICinterpreter that came free with the machine.andP;  Post-TP, some of the referencebooks now describe Pascal as a 'real time language'; if that isn't Borland'sfault, its difficult to see who else to blame.andM;But wait.andP;  This has not been a story without a hitch.andP;  More recently, Borlandintroduced Turbo Prolog.andP;  This was a non-standard implementation of thelanguage (doubters who pointed this out were brushed aside with cries of Turbo Pascal was non-standard, too') which was to be the first reallypragmatic version of Prolog.andP;  Artificial Intelligence had been madeaccessible to the PC user.andP;  About six months ago, Borland announced that itwas returning the rights of this product to its original owner.andP;  Owners ofTurbo Prolog were left, if not entirely up the creek, then certainly a fairdistance from the estuary.andM;Turbo C++ is different.andP;  It is, relatively speaking, much more important tothe company's success: of its surviving language product lines, Turbo C++represents half.andP;  However, despite Borland's description of itself as 'theleader in object-oriented programming' this is its deepest foray into theterritory (last year's intermediate release of Turbo Pascal carried a stronghint of anti-QuickPascal marketing, and rather less OOP technology).andP;  Willthe company hold firm when the inevitable anti-OOP backlash begins? Thespectre of Turbo Prolog has yet to be exorcised.andM;What you seeandM;Turbo C++ comes in two flavours: 'straight' C++, which consists of thecompiler, integrated environment and associated tools and the  Professional'version, where you also get the latest version of Borland's deservedly famousdebugger, an assembler, and a new profiler.andP;  These tools are also availableseparately and, owing to constraints of time and space, this is how I shallbe reviewing them.andP;  This review, then, confines itself to what we might call'Turbo C++ Amateur'.andM;Red, for those of you who have been wondering about the melodramatic headlineat the top of this piece, is the dominant colour of Turbo C++'s box andmanuals.andP;  The software comes on eight 360 KB disks (Microsoft now supplies1.2 MB as standard, and invites those without AT drives to send off for analternative disk set) stored in compressed format.andP;  An easy-to-use andbusiness-like INSTALL program moves the stuff onto your hard disk in shortorder; you get to nominate the target directories, which memory modellibraries that you want and so on.andP;  An omission is that, unlike some rival'srecent efforts, the program does not report exactly how much disk space yourselection requires before it starts; it merely states that the maximum isabout 6MB.andP;  The configuration that I chose -- small and large library memorymodels only, plus everything else in the way of examples and tutorials --occupies 5 MB.andM;With everything gathered safely on board, time to load up the integrateddevelopment environment, which is still called TC.EXE, despite having beenrenamed the Programmer's Platform, if you see what I mean.andP;  The IDE (as Ishall stubbornly continue to call it) has been entirely reworked.andP;  Thatinfluential Chinese-born designer See-Yu Ay has been let loose among thehallowed keystrokes and menus of Turbo C. Having been comparatively slow toacknowledge the onset of the mouse, Borland has now introduced it withvengeance.andP;  Mouse-friendly means keyboard-hostile, at least to start with.andO;You constantly find yourself hitting ENTER where you meant TAB, operationsthat used to take two keystrokes (loading in the file-before-last, forexample) now seem to take loads.andP;  There are some neat new features -- a history' function lets you step back through your previous selections ofsearch/replace and file selection mask strings -- but I am sure that the netchange is an increase in clumsiness of use.andP;  I am uncomfortably aware of thehigh subjective element in this judgement, and apologise for it.andP;  My guess isthat current users of Microsoft Quick...andP;  languages will like it better thancurrent users of the Turbos.andM;Anyway, at least the default editing keys are still Wordstar (function keyassignments have changed slightly), you may tamper with the setup if youwish.andP;  The editor supports a simple macro language -- but you have to compiletext files with a separate macro compiler; there is no macro recordingfacility.andP;  You can use this language to 'wire in' other programs into theenvironment.andP;  (If you get really keen on the IDE, you can even write a filterprogram to let it track error messages output by another compiler).andP;  There isnow a clipboard mechanism for manipulating blocks of text -- it is half-waybetween the Wordstar approach (where the block that you manipulate ishighlighted) and the EMACS/Quick...andP;  compiler approach, where you move textin and out of a hidden buffer.andP;  You can cut text from the context-sensitivehelp and paste it into the edit buffer.andP;  You cannot, however, cut from anarbitrary section of the screen -- for example, the DOS output window.andM;The new system for managing projects -- the IDE's equivalent of a MAKEfunction -- is definitely an improvement, although old Borland hands may haveto fight with it a bit at first.andP;  Turbo C V2.0 PRJ files had to be typed inmanually as text, and consisted of a list of sources and .OBJs, one per line,to be used in the project.andP;  Dependencies had to placed next to the name ofthe file that used them.andP;  The new system automates all of this.andP;  You can justclick on the your selection from the list of files and it is added to thefile.andP;  The IDE finds all the dependencies for you, so you can now use it tobrowse through the #include files that you have sucked in.andP;  Compiler optionsare stored in the project file; you can specify a global default forcompilation switches and file-by-file exceptions.andP;  There is a facility to usethe 'wired-in' external translators mentioned above, so you can incorporatethat module written in Pure Dorset LISP into your C++ project.andM;The feature that may confuse newcomers is that the setup of desktop windowsis stored in the current project file.andP;  When you switch projects, all yourwindows suddenly close themselves down, then reopen somewhere else withdifferent contents.andP;  You can also store textual notes in the project filebut, as you will have deduced, it has a binary format, so can only be alteredby the IDE.andP;  Utilities are provided to convert Turbo C .PRJ files to TurboC++, and also to generate conventional MAKE files from TC++ .PRJ files.andM;The IDE debugger has been fixed up a bit; it now has conditional breakpointsand an inspection facility that handles arrays, structures and classes.andO;Borland has not put too many features into it, however -- remember it intendsto sell you the separate Turbo Debugger.andM;A final note about the IDE.andP;  It manages to squeeze a lot of code into theMS-DOS environment (it does contain a C++ compiler, after all) and yet canstill compile reasonably sized code modules.andP;  How does it manage this? Bymaking extensive use of Borland's overlay system VROOMM (Virtual RuntimeObject-Oriented Memory Manager).andP;  You can generate your own VROOMMapplications with this package, so a more detailed description is in order.andO;Modules (called 'segments') to be overlaid are compiled with a specialswitch.andP;  Stub code is generated for all the segment's entry points.andP;  When theprogram is run, calls to the stubs go to an overlay manager, which determineswhether the required segment is currently loaded.andP;  If it is, the call ispassed on.andP;  If not, the segment is loaded in from disk.andP;  If there isinsufficient pool memory to allow it to be loaded, discard loaded segments.andO;Note that, using this scheme, overlaid functions can call each other, so thesetup requires minimum programmer effort to function.andP;  Note also thatsegments may be discarded to expanded or extended memory, permitting veryfrosty reload times when their turn next comes around.andM;What you getandM;The compiler, or rather the compilers, for there is a differentparsing/front-end mechanism for C and C++, is/are integrated into theenvironment seamlessly, thanks to VROOMM.andP;  I mention this because, if yourfirst experience of an integrated environment was Microsoft C V6.0 PWBrunning under DOS, you might have gained the impression that they are mostlyabout staring at the screen while the compiler swaps itself in and out.andO;(Incidentally: MSC6 users, the word on the street is that the cure, ha-ha, isto run PWB under OS/2.) It has been a traditional feature of Borland'slanguages that small files compile almost instantly.andP;  I am pleased to reportthat this feature has been maintained, and that Turbo C++ is about thefastest (C) compiler around, although it is not as fast as Turbo C V2.0.andM;There are two gains to be had from waiting longer for your object code to bedelivered: thoroughness of language parsing and quality of object code.andP;  Thecompiler is now better at picking up obscure errors than it used to be.andP;  Forexample, I ran TC++ over a version of the Tetris game that I wrote for TurboC V2.0.andP;  It spat out an error where I was trying to write to a dereferencedpointer to a structure.andP;  On closer investigation, it turned out that I haddeclared a pointer to a constant structure, instead of a constant pointer toa structure (stop sniggering, it could easily happen to you), but that TurboC V2.0 had happily allowed me to go ahead and walk all over my supposedlyprotected data.andP;  In this case it did not matter, but you can easily imagine asituation where a safety feature like this would be a life saver.andM;This tighter checking of the source follows from the requirements of C++,which is less tolerant of monkeying around with types than its parentlanguage, and the requirement of ANSI conformance.andP;  This has come a long waysince Turbo C V2.0, which failed 16 out of 79 tests in the famous Plum HallANSI conformance test suite (described by the BSI's Neil Martin in PCW April 89).andP;  Turbo C++ scores 73 by itself and, if you pass the test code through asupplied utility called TRIGRAPH.EXE, it scores 78.andP;  (Borland takes the view,correctly in my opinion, that trigraph sequences, such as ? ? = for #, are sorarely used, there is no point in wasting the time of the ordinary punter byprocessing them in the main compiler itself.andP;  Apparently, omitting theability to cope with trigraph sequences speeds things up significantly.) Thefailure is in the test to cope with multi-character character constants, suchas '1234'.andP;  This places Turbo C++ up there with the ANSIest of compilers, theothers being JPI TopSpeed C VI.0, Lattice C V6.0, Microsoft V6.0 and WatcomV7.0.andM;Borland also claims to provide a full implementation of ATandamp;T's C++ V2.0specification -- ie the version that demands multiple inheritance andpointers to members (the latter is missing from Zortech V2.0).andP;  The companysays that it will track new releases, such as the recent V2.1 (which is notmuch different from V2.0) and the forthcoming ANSI version.andP;  Obsoletefeatures, such as the keyword over load, which was previously required whenoverloading function declarations, can be used, and generate a suitablewarning message.andP;  But it is over another V2.0 feature, type-safe linkage,that I have a quarrel with Borland's design.andM;MangledandM;ATandamp;T's standard requires that inter-module linkages to functions take accountof the function's signature as well as its name.andP;  In other words, under C++you must not be able to refer to a function defined in one module bydifferent prototype (with the same function name) supplied in another.andP;  Thistype-safe linkage is achieved by inventing a new name for the function, basedon the type and number of its arguments plus, if it is a method, its class.andO;The Specification says nothing about how this mangling should be achieved.andO;However, there is a bundle of papers that are distributed with thespecification as Selected Readings'.andP;  One paper, by Bjarne Stroustruphimself, is called Type-safe linkage for C++, and it includes an algorithmfor this mangling.andP;  This is the algorithm used by ATandamp;T's cfront compiler (andhence by Glockenspiel's compiler), and adopted by Zortech for its compiler.andO;Borland, on the other hand, uses a little something of its own.andP;  Given themethodandM;intobj1::fn1(inti,intj)andM;Zortech produces _fn1__4obj1Nii,andM;Borland puts out @obj1@fn1$qii.andM;The problem, of course, is that a class library compiled for use withBorland's compiler won't work with anybody else's, and vice versa.andP;  DidBorland choose to make its product incompatible for marketing reasons, or outof incompetence, because the development team didn't spot Stroustrup's paperuntil too late?andM;A glance through the results of the various tests that I have done (which,although unrepresentative, unrealistic etc, confirm my subjectiveobservations) will show you that, as an optimising compiler, Turbo C++is--nothing to write home about.andP;  The timings, incidentally, were made withthe command line version of the compiler (oh, did I not tell you there was aseparate command line version? Well there is, along with a linker, alibrarian and a conventional MAKE utility).andP;  It has noticeably improved fromthe previous release--it seems to make better use of registers than Turbo CV2.0--but it is not up there in the ozone with the Watcoms of this world.andO;However, as Adam Denning noted last month in his review of Microsoft C V6.0,a man who buys a compiler on good performance alone is a fool.andP;  There again,a man whose code runs faster may sell a few more copies of his package...andM;Libs and DocsandM;Turbo C++'s libraries are very similar to those of its predecessor.andP;  Thereare still the dear old BGI routines for handling graphics.andP;  The exotic ANSIfunctions prototyped in LOCALE.H have been added.andP;  There are a few classes:complex numbers, supported by overloaded trigonometric functions, BCD, a setof generic data structures, such as lists and queues (these are all derivedfrom a single object type, Smalltalk style, and are documented only on disk,for some reason) and I/O streams, old and new (V2.0) style.andM;The inclusion of new-style streams is one over Zortech's effort, which onlyoffers the old sort.andP;  Whether this matters to you depends on whether youbelong to the' cout is brill, it's just like Pascal's write, you can forgetabout types' camp, or the 'printf() may be old-fashioned, but at least youcan see what it is doing' camp.andP;  The function documentation is bountiful,included both on disk and paper, and has been expanded.andP;  For example, thedescription of the DOS Keep () routine includes the listing of a small TSRprogram which hooks into the clock interrupt.andM;Other documentation also maintains the traditional, high Borland standard:there is no attempt here to fob you off with a quick reference card and somehypertext help files.andP;  There are four fair-sized perfect-bound manuals,entitled Getting Started (which includes C and C++ language tutorials),User's Guide, Programmer's Guide (contains ANSI mandatoryimplementation-specific features list) and Reference Guide.andP;  One complaint.andO;There is no explanation of the name-mangling algorithm, not even in the mixedlanguage programming section.andM;ConclusionandM;Borland is one of the big boys in the MSDOS compiler world; the fact that ithas a C++ compiler is significant, because it improves the chances of C++gaining general acceptance.andP;  This, however, is a marketing observation.andP;  In.EXE, we like to retain a technical bias.andP;  Technically speaking, Turbo C++ isa bit disappointing.andM;TC++'s output code is lacklustre; its selection of class libraries, albeitinclusive of ATandamp;T's V2.0 stream I/O, is not large.andP;  TC++ is binaryincompatible with libraries for Zortech, and probably any other PC compilerthat happens to come along.andP;  There is no support for Windows (although thisis promised within a few months) or OS/2 (this is just promised).andP;  Pluspoints: there is a good system of overlays, the integrated environment iscertainly cute, you can use Turbo Debugger on the programs that you produce.andM;During my career as a programmer, none of the software tools that I used wereas slick or as neat a Borland's: this is how I became a fan.andP;  Turbo C++ seemsto lack the special sparkle of the earlier efforts; it is steady rather thanbrilliant.andP;  I hope that they remember to put back the sparkle for next time.andM;Turbo C++ V1.0 retails at S 149.95, Turbo C++ Professional  with extraprogrammer's tools) costs, [British pounds] 249.95.andP;  The software isavailable from dealers.andP;  There are special deals available for registeredBorland users (not just Turbo C) -- the company will contact them soon withdetails.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
