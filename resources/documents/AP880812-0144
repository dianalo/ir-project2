Botha on Fridayaccused U.S. congressmen of ``recklessness'' and said a toughsanctions bill passed by the House of Representatives couldjeopardize a regional peace plan.   Botha said the legislation would not help South African blacksand might ``obstruct or make impossible'' an initiative to endSouth Africa's 73-year rule over South-West Africa, also known asNamibia.   ``The recklessness of members of Congress who do not care in theleast whether their actions adversely affect the search for apeaceful solution to the problems of southern Africa as a whole isastounding,'' Botha said.   The sanctions bill would halt U.S. investment in South Africaand impose a near-total trade embargo. It was approved by the Houseon a 244-132 vote Thursday.   The bill faces a possible Republican filibuster in the Senateand a likely veto by President Reagan. Earlier legislation, whichpassed despite Reagan's veto, bars imports of various South Africancommodities and forbids South African planes to land at U.S.airports.   Botha said the bill emerged ``for purely internal politicalaims.''   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater alsodenounced the bill, saying it would ``destroy America'sflexibility'' to seek change through diplomatic pressure.   Republican members urged the House to adopt a policy of ``blackempowerment'' to increase the economic and political power ofblacks and weaken apartheid's foundations.   But Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., a sanctions supporter, said:``Black economic empowerment in the face of apartheid is animpossibility.''   Leading black anti-apartheid activists in South Africa,including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have urged the West tointensify sanctions as a means of pressuring the government togrant full political rights to the 26 million blacks, who have novote in national affairs under apartheid.   Many black moderates and conservatives, as well as severalprominent white liberals, support the government's contention thatsanctions will have the harshest effect on blacks and will hardenthe white minority's resistance to political change.   Botha said he found it ``particularly remarkable'' that theHouse acted on the bill ``exactly at a time when positive progresswas being made with the peace negotiations between South Africa,Cuba and Angola.''   The three countries Monday announced a cease-fire in the Angolancivil war. South Africa said it was prepared to begin implementinga U.N. plan for Namibian independence Nov. 1, provided agreementcould be reached on a timetable for withdrawing Cuba's troops fromAngola.   The estimated 50,000 Cuban soldiers have been supportingAngola's Marxist government in a 13-year war against a SouthAfrican- and U.S.-backed rebel movement. The movement, the NationalUnion for the Total Independence of Angola, is not a party to thecease-fire.   ``It would be ironical if Resolution 435 (the U.N. independenceplan for Namibia) should reach the point of implementation only tobe obstructed or made impossible as a result of provisions in theAmerican legislation,'' Botha said.   He said unspecified financial transactions necessary toimplement the plan could be affected by the sanctions bill.</TEXT></DOC>
