The clash was on Saturday night west of the village of Aaramta,11 miles north of the Israeli border, the army said. It gave noexplanation for the delay in the announcement.   The military command said an Israeli force encountered a squad ofLebanese guerrillas and opened fire, killing eight. There were noIsraeli casualties, according to the military command.   No further details were released. But Israel army radio quotedreports from Lebanon as saying the squad apparently belonged to theradical Shiite Moslem movement Hezbollah, or Party of God.   The clash, the first reported battle between Israeli soldiers andguerrillas in southern Lebanon this year, followed at least threeattempts by guerrillas to infiltrate into Israel late in December.   Israeli troops killed six guerrillas from radical Palestiniangroups in two aborted infiltrations Dec. 26 and Dec. 28. Three otherguerrillas drowned Dec. 26 on their way to Israel in a boat.   The operation Saturday was one of Israel's rare incursions northof the security zone, a six-to-10 mile buffer strip north of theborder.   Israel carved out the zone in 1985 when it withdrew my militia andIsraeli troops.</TEXT></DOC>
