The company also disclosed that federal regulators are seeking to limit its influence over its thrift unit, San Jacinto Savings Association.    The loss reflects a $206 million reserve that includes a $120 million addition to loan-loss reserves at its San Jacinto Savings Association unit and reserves against its marketable securities and mortgage loan portfolios. The company also posted a $20 million extraordinary gain from purchasing the company's debt at a big discount in the open market. Revenue was $819 million.    The reserves and debt purchase reflect the troubled real estate and financial services concern's efforts to bring its assets in line with their market value and to dig out from under a mountain of debt. As previously reported, Southmark has been selling assets and subsidiaries to generate cash and reduce its more than $2 billion in debt.    In the year-earlier quarter, the company had profit of $25 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $691 million.    Southmark also disclosed that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has asked the company and its San Jacinto Savings unit to sign a voluntary cease-and-desist order intended to make the savings and loan more independent of its parent. A Southmark spokesman said the request is believed to be an effort to keep San Jacinto from buying and selling operating companies, such as a homebuilder, that are outside the scope of traditional savings and loan activities.    According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the regulators would like to restrict Southmark's asset sales to San Jacinto, require Southmark to buy certain assets from the thrift and to reduce the number of Southmark officials on San Jacinto's board to one from three.    Southmark said it is reviewing the request. However, it added that San Jacinto believes the order is &quot;inappropriate&quot; and could hurt its business. Two years ago, federal regulators ordered the two companies to restrict their dealings and put limits on San Jacinto's investments and growth. That order was lifted last year.    In using some of its cash to buy back public debt, Southmark is trying to make a dent in its approximately $1.2 billion in public junk bonds, which cost it at least $150 million a year in interest expenses. The company, which earlier this year suspended preferred dividends to save cash, said it spent about $60 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase $86 million face amount of debt.    The company is believed to still be acquiring debt on the open market. The bonds currently are trading for between $390 and $850 for each $1,000 face amount, or about $700 million for the $1.2 billion face amount.    One analyst said the deep discounts reflect the market's skepticism about the ability of Southmark to realize the full value of its assets. Although the company said the fourth-quarter reserves are intended to straighten up its balance sheet, the analyst suggested that much of the company's real estate still is carried at values higher than the property would fetch in the current market. The company has been selling some of its better assets at a premium, he says, to bide time while its other assets recover.    Southmark said it has sold more than $400 million in real estate assets in 1988 as part of a goal to sell about $500 million during the calendar year. It also is in agreement to sell two majority owned subsidiaries, which would bring it more than $300 million in cash before the end of 1988.    The company is planning to file a restructuring plan with the SEC in the next two weeks calling for it to become a holding company. The current Southmark, the savings and loan, the insurance group and the financing subsidiary all would become units of the new parent. Southmark said the structure would give it more financial flexibility.    For the full year, Southmark had a net loss of $125 million, including the $20 million gain from debt purchases, on revenue of $2.84 billion. In the previous year, it had net income of $85 million, or $1.09 a share, on revenue of $2.11 billion. The financial results reflect the first time Southmark has consolidated all its operations, as required by new accounting standards. </TEXT></DOC>
