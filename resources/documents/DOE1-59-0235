<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-59-0235 </DOCNO><TEXT>A fast accurate multi-stage numerical method, back-averaging, is developed,analyzed, and optimized. The technique is used to solve an alternatingdimensional numerical simulation of fusion plasma transport based onnonlinear resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The geometryof the model is a complicated time-dependent two-dimensional configurationof flux contours analogous to a doublet. Numerical convergence rate comparisonsof the optimized back-averaging method with various other iterative techniquesfor solving the numerical problem show that optimized back-averagingis the fastest method of all those considered. Moreover, to accomplishconvergence in a practical length of time for extremely peaked profilesand complicated time varying configurations, back-averaging is essential.Further, with a minimum of additional computation, optimized back-averagingyields extreme accuracy. copyright 1988 Academic Press, Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
