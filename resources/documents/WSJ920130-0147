The quotes -- assuredly not indicative of a hit -- arevarious assessments in the business community of PresidentBush's State of the Union address. They were culled fromscores of interviews conducted yesterday by Wall StreetJournal reporters around the country.   The interviewees -- top executives, for the most part --would normally be expected to greet the words of a Republicanpresident with unbridled enthusiasm. Small business, too,gave the president qualified approval. But these aren'tnormal times for American business, and while the president'smessage was warmly supported by some, his proposals were farfrom the building blocks of a uniformly positive consensus.   Here is a sampling of some of the business community'sopinion of the president's speech:                                                                                                          JOSEPH JACOBS   Chief Executive, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.                                                                                                          &quot;An appeal for all of us to work together to help theeconomy is a wellfounded one, and as an unabashed patriot Iloved the tone of the speech,&quot; says Mr. Jacobs, whose companyis an engineering, design, environmental and hazardous-wastemanagement and construction firm in Pasadena, Calif.   &quot;As to the specific suggestions, I obviously support them.I liked his idea of setting a deadline. The economy needspositive action, and we can't debate it endlessly and justflounder around.   &quot;Confidence is extremely important. In some ways, Ibelieve we almost talked ourselves into this recession.&quot;                                                                                                          ROBERT W. LINDAL   President, Lindal Cedar Homes Inc.                                                                                                          Mr. Bush's speech provided &quot;a very good approach,&quot; saysMr. Lindal, stimulating the economy enough, withoutoverheating it and driving interest rates back up.   &quot;The withholding change he's going to make himself willfree some cash flowputs a lot more cash in the people'spockets right away.&quot;   For Lindal Cedar, which makes custom homes, the best newswas the first-time home-buyer credit. Most of theSeattlebased company's customers aren't first-time buyers,but the tax breaks will create &quot;movement in the marketplace,&quot;he says.   &quot;You'd always like more, but it does no good to overheatthe market and drive up interest rates.&quot;                                                                                                          WILLIAM B. DERRICKSON   Chief Executive, Quadrex Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;There are a lot of one-time, short-term things in there,&quot;says Mr. Derrickson. &quot;Some of the root causes of why we gotto where we are aren't addressed -- like why people buyJapanese cars instead of American. If you don't address theroot cause, nothing will be solved.&quot;   The tax cuts represent a gamble, Mr. Derrickson says.&quot;What if it doesn't spur business on? Then we could have aneven bigger deficit problem than we have now.&quot;   One area that needs major change, he says, is incentivesfor research and development. &quot;Research and development needsto be put back into this country in a big way,&quot; Mr.Derrickson says, arguing that the president's proposals don'tadequately address the problem. He says his own business hasbeen hurt because research and development costs have to beaccounted for in one year instead of capitalized over severalyears. &quot;They need to change the rules.&quot; Quadrex is anenvironmental-engineering services company in Gainesville,Fla.                                                                                                          GLENN SCHAEFFER   President, Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.                                                                                                          &quot;I thought the package was a little less than he wouldcome up with,&quot; Mr. Schaeffer says. &quot;I think the conservativesstill want him to do nothing, saying the economy is alreadybeginning to perk up, so make gestures but don't doanything.&quot;   Circus, which plans to build a $290 million pyramid-shapedhotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev., by fall 1993, wouldn'tbenefit from the investment tax allowance as it's currentlyplanned. &quot;The 15% credit in 1992 applies if you're in serviceby June 1993. We're in a state that has three of the largestconstruction projects in the U.S. -- three of the largestjob-generating projects -- and they'll open after the currentin-service date.&quot;   Pushing that date back would benefit not only Circus, henotes, but also Mirage Resorts Inc.'s planned Treasure Islandcasino and MGM Grand Inc.'s $1 billion hotel-casino and themepark scheduled to open by early 1994.                                                                                                          LESLIE G. McCRAW   Chief Executive, Fluor Corp.   &quot;My reaction to the speech was pretty positive, morepositive than I expected,&quot; says Mr. McCraw. &quot;I like the wayhe looked, fresh and alert. I liked the structure of themessage in that it showed a recognition that in solvingproblems, there are short-term elements and long-termelements. It would have been a mistake to have knee-jerkreactions.&quot;   Fluor, an engineering, construction, maintenance andtechnical services company, just had its best year ever. &quot;Interms of specifics, the obvious one in terms of our businesswas the reduction in the capital-gains tax. It will probablyspur some spending on projects that wouldn't have goneforward otherwise, which will create jobs for our clients andfor us.   &quot;Longer term, the Randamp;D credit was excellent. It shouldincrease U.S. competitiveness and will affect a broad arrayof different industries, including some in this region likebiotechnology, pharmaceuticals and oil.   &quot;The notion of a moratorium on regulations -- everyoneshould be for that. If there's a reduction of federalregulations that by themselves discourage expansion, maybesome states will take a cue from that and ease or reducestate regulation.&quot;                                                                                                          MARK GOODE   Chief Executive, LaunchTech Inc.                                                                                                          The proposal to extend the research and development taxcredit permanently &quot;could go two ways,&quot; says Mr. Goode. &quot;Thiscould be more posturing by President Bush. {Until now} theadministration has avoided anything that smacks of industrialpolicy. This could be a trial balloon for a meaningfulredistribution of dollars, particularly for technology.&quot;   With part of his Richardson, Texas, consulting businessdirected at finding capital for emerging companies, Mr. Goodeis a strong supporter of the capital-gains tax cut, though heconcedes that &quot;a very small percentage of Americans willbenefit&quot; from it. Nevertheless, he says, &quot;the stimulationwill create new jobs and new opportunities.&quot;                                                                                                          ROBERT I. TOLL   Chief Executive, Toll Brothers Inc.   President Bush was &quot;selling us short&quot; by not presenting aneconomic vision, says Mr. Toll. &quot;What we saw to a largeextent was a rehash of proposals he's made in the past, whichare very political.&quot;   But as a home builder, Mr. Toll says he kept jumping upand saying &quot;Yes, yes, yes]&quot; as the president outlined the taxcredit for first-time home buyers. The proposal, he says,wouldn't directly affect his Huntingdon Valley, Pa., company,which concentrates on luxury housing that is out of reach formost first-time home buyers. &quot;The impact will be on what'sknown as the daisy chain,&quot; he says. &quot;If people are buyingmove-up housing, they'll have to sell their home first.&quot;   He cautions, however, that the tax-credit proposal, whichmust be passed by Congress, could have a negative impact inthe short run. &quot;There's nothing worse than telling somebodythey can buy it for less next week. Now everybody's going tosay, `Let's wait.'&quot;                                                                                                          DICK HAGENAUER   Marketing Analyst, Whirlpool Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;My overall feeling is, {the package} was too politicaland too complicated,&quot; says Mr. Hagenauer, who overseeseconomic and product forecasting for Whirlpool. By &quot;raisingtoo many issues&quot; in trying to boost the economy, thepresident risks confusing consumers, Mr. Hagenauer says.   Whirlpool, which sells Whirlpool, KitchenAid and Roperappliances in the U.S., stands to be one of the primebeneficiaries of the credit for first-time home buyers. ButMr. Hagenauer says that for many consumers, &quot;uncertainty andjobs&quot; are still the biggest concerns. Whirlpool worries thatan overly ambitious program could backfire on home builders:A package that overstimulates the economy could boostinflation, raise interest rates and &quot;nip any builder businessin the bud.&quot;   To help avoid that, Mr. Hagenauer says, middle-income taxbreaks should be temporary.                                                                                                          KIRK RAAB   President, Genentech Inc.                                                                                                          President's Bush proposals include four initiativesessential to the young, Randamp;D-intensive biotechnology industry,Mr. Raab says.   &quot;First, the research initiative. {Mr. Bush} addressed itbroadly, but I'm confident it will be directed tobiotechnology. The human genome project is typical of thekind of research that needs government support.   &quot;Second, was the reference to regulatory agencies and thebenefits of making them more efficient.   &quot;Third was the Randamp;D tax credit, which is vitally importantto us.&quot; And finally, the capital-gains tax cut.   Biotechnology &quot;is an industry that constantly needsinfusions of capital,&quot; Mr. Raab says, &quot;and the best source isthe equity market. There's no doubt that this will {helpmake} more funds to be available.&quot;                                                                                                          JACK SHEINKMAN   President, Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union                                                                                                          Mr. Sheinkman says he is &quot;disappointed&quot; with PresidentBush's plan, calling it &quot;the same warmed-over agenda. It istoo concerned with capital gains and doesn't address theissue of an industrial policy.&quot;   Mr. Sheinkman, whose union has shrunk from 350,000 members10 years ago to 250,000 workers today, says providingincentives to developers and major businesses won't achievethe president's purposes if people aren't working.   &quot;The repeal of the luxury tax isn't going to stimulate theeconomy. We need a stronger trade policy. Our government isspending millions of dollars to lure manufacturers to theCaribbean basin, exporting jobs. But they won't help Americanmanufacturers who are in Paris this week trying to exportmen's clothes made here.&quot;   Mr. Sheinkman also suggested that the president shouldfurther cut defense spending, singling out the Star Warssystem. &quot;He also needs to deal with the health issue in ameaningful way.&quot;                                                                                                          JEREMY SIEGEL   Professor of Finance, Wharton School, University ofPennsylvania                                                                                                          Prof. Siegel says he was &quot;disappointed&quot; in Mr. Bush'saddress, particularly &quot;his confrontational position withCongress: `You better pass my package or else.' A morecooperative tone would have worked better.&quot;   The ideas for changing the tax code could yield benefitsin the longer term, he says, but they're no quick fix for asagging economy. &quot;How can a capital-gains cut get us out ofrecession? Setting this up as the linchpin of his tax policyis disingenuous.&quot;   Moreover, &quot;the home-buyer credit isn't necessary. Thelowering of interest rates is far more important in reviving&quot;the housing market. A policy for investment in education, inplant and technology&quot; is needed much more.   Mr. Siegel also questions undoing some of the taxrevisions of the 1980s, the point of which &quot;was to eliminateloopholes, to treat all income equally. Now this would moveback to various exceptions.&quot; Inevitably, he says, the neteffect of the changes will be higher tax rates.                                                                                                          WILLIAM W. GEORGE   Chief Executive, Medtronic Inc.                                                                                                          &quot;My view is that the president's plan is a step in theright direction but doesn't go far enough in various ways,&quot;says Mr. George, whose company makes pacemakers and othermedical devices.   About the proposed moratorium on new federal regulations,Mr. George says, &quot;Ninety days is not a long time, and we havea whole lot of concerns in that regard. The current researchenvironment is very restrained, and we end up doing a lot ofresearch overseas as a result. Doing research overseas isbecoming increasingly common in the health-care field; itstarted in pharmaceuticals and now has reached themedical-device industry.   &quot;We've also been concerned about access to health care forthe millions of uninsured Americans. A tax break is a step inthe right direction there, too, but I don't think it dealssufficiently with the long-term issues like access to healthcare for the uninsured, and the need to hold down costs.We'll have to see more.&quot;                                                                                                          ROBERT BLONQUIST   Chief Credit Officer, Integra Financial Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;I thought it was a hard-hitting partisan speech, more sothan in the past, because we're in an election year,&quot; saysMr. Blonquist in Pittsburgh.   &quot;It was more specific than I thought it would be, in termsof reduction in nuclear arms and tax proposals, some elementsof which I'm not sure anyone in the audience understood.   &quot;I was upset at the president for leaning on regulatorsbecause they're doing a good job. We need reasonableindependent regulatory review&quot; so banks don't repeat themistakes of the past.                                                                                                          JOHN KINSEY BAKER III   Owner, The Book Haven                                                                                                          Mr. Baker, whose shop is a small out-of-print and rarebook business in Lancaster, Pa., expressed dismay withPresident Bush's proposals. &quot;There's nothing in his planwhich will help me personally or my business. He's offeringsome help to firsttime home buyers, and he's going to trimthe capital-gains tax, but I don't expect those moves totranslate into more sales at my store. A lot of people areunemployed here.&quot;   Repealing the luxury tax might help local boat builders,some of whom have complained bitterly that the luxury tax hascrippled their businesses, Mr. Baker says. But he adds thatMr. Bush appeared to offer relatively little to the middleclass. &quot;At the very least, I'd have liked to have seen thepresident allow us to fully deduct our IRA deposits,regardless of income,&quot; Mr. Baker says. &quot;Many people aren'tgoing to have real savings when they retire.&quot;                                                                                                          CHARLES CASAMENTO   Chief Executive, Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc.                                                                                                          Mr. Casamento says he is &quot;reasonably pleased&quot; by PresidentBush's proposals. &quot;It may be enough if it all gets done.That's the critical issue.&quot;   Given that it's an election year for Congress as well asthe president, &quot;I would think eventually people will get verypragmatic. It may just happen.&quot;   Mr. Casamento says the tax proposals related to equipmentpurchases and to research and development spending areespecially welcome for small but fast-growing companies suchas his, a biotechnology concern in Lexington, Mass. He addsthat he also is pleased with the breaks for home buyers,&quot;because once housing gets going, the whole economy should dobetter.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
