(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic vice presidential candidateLloyd Bentsen is bringing his attack on Republican campaign adsfrom factories to churches to farmers in hopes of winning abacklash vote in key states.   The Texas senator travels today to the Dakotas and to Montana.It's the first time since a single stop in Minot, N.D., in Julythat the Democratic ticket has made an appearance in that region.   The trip will include a visit to White, S.D., where the Bentsenfamily first came to the United States from Denmark. Besidesshowing Democratic interest in those states, normally a GOPstronghold, Bentsen will keep up his strident attacks on theRepublican tactics.   Those efforts have taken on nearly a missionary zeal, as theDemocrats struggle to come from behind in the final two weeks ofthe campaign.   ``They're bearing false witness against Michael Dukakis,''Bentsen told a rally at the Greater Paradise Baptist Church inLittle Rock, Ark., on Monday night. ``And we're going to set thatrecord straight.''   ``The truth is catching up, and the power of the truth willprevail,'' said Bentsen, who joined the church in singing ``TheBattle Hymn of the Republic.''   Bentsen launched his final 16-day campaign push in theRepublican city of Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday. He toldreporters there the Republican campaign had racial overtonesbecause of its focus on the case of convicted murderer WillieHorton Jr., who raped a Maryland woman last year after Horton hadescaped from a Massachusetts prison furlough.   ``They are obviously dealing with a black man who, in thatinstance, had raped a white woman, and that certainly came throughin the ad,'' said Bentsen. Asked what came through, he replied:``Racism.''   From the Michigan businessmen, Bentsen flew to Cape Girardeau,Mo., where he told clothing workers that the Republicans weretrying to distract them from issues where the Democrats had themore attractive policies _ issues like trade, the minimum wage, andhealth insurance.   In the evening church rally in Little Rock, Bentsen challengedBush to ``drop these false ads'' and move on to more substantialissues. And he addressed the potential Democratic problem of voterapathy among blacks.   ``Don't let anyone tell you your vote doesn't count,'' he said.   North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana haven't voted for aDemocratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Butthe party believes there is great dissatisfaction there this yearwith the Reagan administration's farm policies, GOP nominee GeorgeBush, and his choice of Dan Quayle as a running mate, said MikeMcCurry, Bentsen's press secretary.   Although the three states have only 10 electoral votes betweenthem, the Democrats feel they can make an inroad into the so-called``electoral lock'' the Republican ticket appears to have on suchstates.   ``We're poaching on what is presumed to be Republicanterritory,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
