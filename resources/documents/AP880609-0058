At least 200 mutineers of the 19th Artillery Regiment and the8th Infantry Battalion were killed in clashes with 3,000 loyaltroops April 7-8 before rebel units surrendered, the sources saidWednesday. The two units are based near the Ugandan capital ofKampala.   About 700 mutineers were captured and detained by militarypolice at Luzira prison in Kampala, said the sources, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   A presidential convoy was ambushed April 11 on the 22-milehighway from Kampala to the State House in Entebbe. Mutineerskilled at least 16 military escorts when they fired on two of threemilitary trucks, the sources said.   But Museveni was not traveling in his official bulletproof car.He had flown by helicopter from Kampala to the State House andevidently had sent the seven-vehicle convoy along the road withouthim, the sources said.   The attackers escaped.   Military headquarters in Kampala ordered local journalists notto report the mutiny, and several people were detained in thecapital for discussing it publicly, the sources said.   The sources said they belong to a group of dissident officerswho want Museveni to hold peace talks with several rebel armies,improve conditions for soldiers and expel 100 Libyan and 250 NorthKorean military instructors from the former British colony in EastAfrica.   They said the mutiny and ambush were aimed at toppling Museveni.   The military command in Kampala, contacted by telephone fromNairobi, would not confirm or deny the reports.   Telephones at State House alternately went unanswered or werebusy.   No previous attempts to assassinate Museveni have been reported.   Museveni seized power Jan. 27, 1986, ending a five-year bush waragainst civilian President Milton Obote and the military junta thatousted Obote in July 1985.   The sources said the captives had not been ill-treated and wouldbe sent to re-education camps at Entebbe, Kyankwanzi west ofKampala and Mobuku near the Zaire border. The government set up thecamps to screen surrendering rebels before they are absorbed intothe army or allowed to return to civilian life.   Soldiers loyal to Obote and other toppled Ugandan leaders,including military dictator Idi Amin, have mounted insurgenciessince August 1986 and Museveni's National Resistance Army has beenbattling several rebel groups.   On Saturday, Museveni signed a peace agreement with thecommander of the largest rebel group, Lt. Col. John Angelo Okelloof the northern-based Uganda People's Democratic Army. But EricOtema Allimadi, the rebels' leader in exile in London, rejected theaccord in advance.   Museveni envoys are trying to negotiate a similar agreement witha smaller rebel group fighting in the east, the Uganda People'sArmy.</TEXT></DOC>
