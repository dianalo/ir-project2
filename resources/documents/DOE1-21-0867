The application of this technique in the geotechnicalfield has increased rapidly in the last 15-20 years and it is now appliedin a variety of mining related areas. This paper will discuss the fundamentalsof the AE/MS technique and will consider the current application of thetechnique to a number of mining related field problems including rooffall, rock burst, and coal burst prediction and location. Laboratoryapplications of this technique are also increasing in importance andthe paper will consider the use of AE/MS laboratory tests on rock coreas a means of evaluating in-situ stress conditions, and laboratory studiesundertaken to develop methods for monitoring rock bolt instability.</TEXT></DOC>
