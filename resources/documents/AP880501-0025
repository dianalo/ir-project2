The Strategic Air Command Base was hit by several reductionsduring the early 1970s. Presidents Ford and Carter tried to phaseout the base in the late '70s because of fears its proximity to theAtlantic would make it vulnerable to submarine-launched ballisticmissiles.   But the Pentagon backed down after Maine's congressionaldelegation and a ``Save Loring Committee'' successfully argued thatpoor, rural Aroostook County would be economically devastated bythe loss of the base.   Since then, the military has spent about $150 million torenovate the 2,000-acre base, prompting Rep. Olympia Snowe,R-Maine, to say in 1984 that that spending indicated the AirForce's ``long-range intentions toward Loring.''   And in recent years, the base has been called valuable for itsstrategic location to Canada and because it is the closest AirForce base in the continental United States to the Soviet Union.   Loring was carved out of a virgin forest hard by the NewBrunswick, Canada, border following World War II. It currentlyemploys 3,760 military and 564 civilian personnel and assigns itspilots to fly B-52 bombers and KC-135 jets.</TEXT></DOC>
