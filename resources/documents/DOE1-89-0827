These parameters enable the merits and demeritsof alternative expansion schemes and operational procedures to be compared.One design that can have a major impact on both the reliability and productioncost of a generation system is interconnection with one or more neighboringsystems. This paper describes a method that enables both the reliabilityof the interconnected system and the associated production cost to beevaluated. The method is based on the equivalent assisting unit approachand the evaluation of energy supplied using the Loss of Energy Expectation(LOLE) method. A very important element of the method is that the assistingsystem is represented by a multiple set of equivalent units, each ofwhich is deduced as a multi-state unit and each of which can be associatedwith its own production cost. This method enables variation in energycosts of the assisting system to be modelled. The paper has developeda simple and practical approach for including this model in the analysis.A detailed analysis of the IEEE-RTS has been included. The results obtainedfor this system demonstrate justification for the modelling if energycosts are a variable. On the other hand, if only reliability indicesare required, the multi-unit model of the assisting system is not required.</TEXT></DOC>
