 The Organiser's internal RAM has been steadilyexpanded, and add-on storage modules have appeared in larger capacities.andP;  Wereviewed the current top-of-the-line model, the $420 Organiser Il LZ-64,which has 64K of internal RAM and accepts add-on storage cartridges indensities up to 256K.andM;The Organiser's well-designed menu-based internal software has grownconsiderably in functionality and usefulness over the course of severalrevisions.andP;  An impressive catalog of software and hardware accessories nowgraces the Organiser as well.andP;  There is a snap-on, Hayes-compatible,1,200-bps modem ($199.99), as well as other peripherals such as a bar codereader ($249.99) and a magnetic card reader ($299.99), both of which aresuitable for vertical and OEM applications such as data acquisition andinventory control.andM;MINIMAL DISPLAYS, NO QWERTYandM;For all these improvements, however, the Organiser has lagged behind in twocrucial areas: its display and its keyboard.andP;  In fact.andP;  the  Organiser's 1.1-by 3- by 5.6inch (HWD) case has changed little since it, introduction and the9-volt batteryoperated unit bears a strong resemblance to a coventionalcalculator.andP;  The two least expensive menbers of the Organiser line (the 8KRAM Organiser Il CM.andP;  which sells for $209.99.andP;  and the 32K RAM Organiser IIXP).andP;  Which has a list price of $282.49) have tiny two line by, 16-characterdisplays.andM;Two more expensive models.andP;  the 32K RAM Organiser II LZ ($314.99) and thetop-of-the-line.andP;  64K RAM Organiser Il LZ-64 ($419.99) feature slightlylarger displays.andP;  These dispalys however, still show only four  20-characterlines at a time-far less than competing palmtops do.andP;  The displays do scroll.andO;one line at a time.andP;  to show a full 80-character line.andP;  but reading a linethat way quickly grows frustratingandM;Even more difficult is attempting to type on the Organiser's alphabeticallyorganized keyboard which severely limits it, its appeal for general users.andO;Nearly all palmtops row have QWERTY keyboards; even the most cramped QWERTYlayout is better than ABC organization fro any sort of text entry.andM;SUPERIOR MENU SYSTEMandM;Despite the antiquated key-board.andP;  an ingenious menu-driven softwarestructure allows easy selection of built-in options.andP;  The LZ-64's operating,system and builtin applications are contained in 64K of ROM  above and beyondthe 64K of available RAM).andM;When you tap the LZ-64's On key.andP;  the first thing you see is a menu ofapplications and utilities.andP;  From then on, navigation is simple.andP;  Forexample.andP;  moving the cursor to Save and tapping Exe.andP;  the Oraniser'sequivalent of Enter.andP;  causes the LZ-64 to prompt for text to save.andP;  Toretrieve any  saved text.andP;  choose Find from the main menu and enter a searchstring.andM;The Organiser initially keeps all saved text in a central file; you can,however, create separate files by using the Xfiles menu option.andM;This ultra-easy-to-use text base is great for saving quick notes or simpledatabase records.andP;  but the always frustrating keyboard makes text entry achore.andP;  Another facility keeps track of appointments: You can enter anappointment by choosing either Diary or Month (to invoke a calendar display)from the main menu.andP;  A hardware/software combination, available separatelyfor $99.99, lets you share appointment files with your desktop machine.andO;Notes, another main menu choice, accesses a notepad.andM;The main menu also gives access to a local and world clock, user-configurablealarms, and an extremely sophisticated calculator.andP;  The calculator isparticularly powerful because its command line accepts any of the numericfunctions designed for the Organiser's built-in programming language, OPL.andM;Other pocket organisers like the Sharp Wizard and the Atari Portfolio maysupport programming languages, but none of them offer a structured,procedural language like OPL as standard equipment.andM;While nonprogrammers will use OPL in conjunction with the calculator, moreadventurous users can write their own procedures and add them to theOrganiser's main menu.andP;  then launch them with a tap of the Exe key.andM;The Organiser offers mass storage in the form of add-on proprietary, modulesthat snap into two ports on the back of the unit.andP;  About half the size of anaverage thumb, these modules are available as batterybacked RAMs, which Psioncalls rampacks, or as EPROMS, which Psion refers to as datapacks.andP;  Therampacks, which are available in convenient 32K  $105), 128K ($263), and 256K($368), can be written to, erased, and formatted without any additionalequipment.andM;The datapacks work like the rampacks, except that deleted data is notactually removed until the pack is reformatted using an optional hardwarereformatter ($150).andP;  The additional expense of the formatter may be justifiedby the lower price of the EPROM datapacks, which come in densities of 16K($45), 32K ($65), 64K ($105) and 128K  $200).andP;  Several datapack users couldshare one formatter and thereby avoid the higher cost of the rampacks.andM;Besides these snap-on storage packs, the rear-mounted ports accept storagemodules containing ROM-based software.andP;  Psion publishes a selection ofapplications in this format, including a spreadsheet ($99.99) that writes1-2-3-format files, two separate finance packs ($80 and $100), and aportfolio manager  $100).andP;  All are designed specifically for use with theOrganiser.andM;Even with these enhancements, the Organiser has lagged behind technologicallybecause Psion has not upgraded its inadaquate screen and keyboard.andP;  For manyusers, these are critical deficiencies.andM;It would be a mistake, however, to dismiss the Organiser out of hand since ithas certain unique capabilities that its competitors lack.andP;  Support for dataacquisition peripherals, for example, makes the Organiser a natural for manyOEM or dedicated uses.andP;  The OPL programming language-another asset-gives itthe flexibility to adapt to a variety of tasks.andP;  In addition, the Organiser'sbuilt-in software is powerful, flexible, and easier to use than that of justabout any other organizer available.andP;  If Psion would bring its keyboard andscreen up to prevailing standards.andP;  the Organiser would be a palmtop secondto store.andM;When Sharp introduced the Wizard almost three years ago, it was little morethan a fascinating novelty.andP;  Driven by a proprietary  processor, the firstWizard had intriguing-but mostly unrealized expansion and communicationspotential.andP;  However, it was born with an inadaquate 16-character by 8-linedisplay and an alphabetically arranged keyboard that completely frustratedattempts at efficient text entry.andM;Sharp obviously paid attention to criticism of the original model: The $399OZ8200 Wizard reviewed here not only eliminates most of its predecessor'sdeficiencies but also ranks as one of the strongest entries in the palmtopsweepstakes.andP;  It runs on four 6-volt lithium batteries (CR2032) and uses asingle CR2032 lithium cell as a memory backup.andM;The OZ-8200 has a clear, legible 8-line by 40-character display and acompletely redesigned QWERTY keyboard.andP;  Sharp has efficiently nestled thekeys into the Wizard's 0.8- by 7- by 3.8-inch (HWD) case, so that touchtyping is possible if not exactly fast or enjoyable.andP;  The keys have aspringy, yet yielding feel that might seem mushy on a desktop machine butworks in this ultra-miniature environment.andP;  Besides the usual alphanumerickeys, the keyboard has several rows of Wizard-specific keys along the top.andM;TOUCH SCREENandM;The OZ-8200 retains one of the most exciting features of the original Wizard:a small, membrane touchpad, situated to the right of the display, whichaugments the main keyboard.andP;  The transparent membrane is actually a windowthat covers the Wizard's card slot and allows credit-cardsized software ROMcards to display touchpad menus printed on the card's front side.andP;  With asoftware ROM in place, the user accesses the software by pressing definedareas on the membrane touchpad.andM;The ROMs have printed icons, or key labels, that are visible through themembrane and identify the function of each defined touchpad region.andP;  Inaddition to the software ROMs, the Wizard's card slot accepts RAM cards in32K (S80).andP;  64K  ($130).andP;  and 128K ($150) densities.andP;  Sharp offers an arrayof suprisingly powerful software for it's OZ-8200.andP;  distributed on theincreasingly familiar credit-card-size ROM cards.andP;  Much of this software alsoruns on two other Wizard models  the  OZ-7200 ($329).andP;  which is similar tothe original OZ-7000  S299) but offers  64K of built-in RAM instead of 32K.,andO;and the OZ-8000  S359.95).andP;  which differs from, the 8200 only in that itoffers 64K of RAM instead of 128K.andP;  At the bottom of the eight-model Wizardline is the S110 ZQ-2000.andP;  Which could be called a glorified calaculator.andM;LUCID SPREADSHEETSandM;The sheer volume of programs available for systems like the Sharp Wizardsuggests that palmtops are now viable platforms for development.andP;  ThePersonal Computer Support Group, for instance, de w eloped a Wizard versionof its popular Lucid 3-D spreadsheet (S 1 80).andP;  which supports 3-D sheets  upto  26 columns and 999) rows per spreadsheet file) and draws simple line.andO;bar.andP;  and pie charts on-screen.andM;The package comes with software for your desktop machine that not onlytransfers files to arid from the Wizard but also converts them to Lucid 3-Dor 1-2-3 formats.andM;Another ROM card.andP;  together with Sharp's proprietary, 1- by, 4.8- by 3-inchFax Modem connects your Wizard to the world.andP;  The battery-powered faxcomponent plugs into a port on the left side of the Wizard's case andtransmits or receives faxes at 4,800 bps.andP;  The modem portion of the deviceruns at a disappointing 300 bps, but it's fast enough to transmit electronicmail or information from services like Compuserve.andP;  Including software, theFax/ Modem option sells for $499.andP;  A 300-bps, modem-only package costs $180.andM;Sharp's Organizer Link ($130) is a hardware/software combination which doesfor the Wizard what LapLink and similar packages do for the PC.andP;  Aproprietary cable, included with the package, connects the Wizard to yourPc's serial port.andP;  The software manages file transfers and allows conversioninto Sidekick H or .SDF (standard delimited format) database format.andO;Conversion to Sidekick's format is quick and easy, and, together withSidekick's schedule reconciliation feature, allows the Wizard to be an equalpartner with your desktop PC in managing your time.andM;Organizer Link functions well as a data hub for the Wizard's built-inapplications, but it should also handle spreadsheet files.andP;  It shouldn't benecessary to use the software included with the spreadsheet card to transferand convert files.andM;DESIGN-YOUR-OWNandM;Perhaps the most powerful software for the Wizard is marketed by NictrixCorp. of Leonia, New Jersey.andP;  The Toolkit program develops simple flat-filedatabase applications on your desktop, then transfers them to the Wizard byan included cable.andP;  The applications are written to a special Wizard EPROMcard, available in 32K and 128K capacities.andM;The desktop software lets you map your own Wizard touch-screen functions tothe ROM card-a capability that makes possibilities for software like this asendless as they are obvious.andP;  A single PC could generate applications to bedistributed to Wizard-equipped salespeople or auditors, for example.andP;  Toolkitsells for $299 with one 32K ROM card or $360 with one 128K card.andP;  Additionalcards are available for $199 (32K) and $260 (128K).andP;  Nictrix also offers amore advanced version of Toolkit that includes relational databasefunctionality and other advanced features.andM;Other third-party software is available for use with several of the popularpersonal information managers or contact managers.andP;  Eye-on Associates ofWestfield, New Jersey, produces a link to Lotus's Agenda.andP;  Polaris Software,of Escondito, California, publishes software that transfers data from itsPIM, PackRat, directly into the Wizard, and Timeslips Corp. of Essex,Massachusetts, offers a link to Timeslips III, a receivables accountingsystem.andM;The Wizard's built-in functions-calendar/scheduler, phone list, outliner,memo pad, business card registry, clock and calculator-vary in theircomplexity and the ease with which they can be learned.andP;  Since Sharp made noattempt at mimicking MS-DOS, some keystrokes and procedures may seem somewhatcryptic or unintuitive to seasoned PC users.andP;  With a little bit of practice,however, comes fluency.andM;ADJUNCT EXISTENCEandM;A few shortcomings in the software, nonetheless, suggest that Sharp didn'talways keep PC users in mind.andP;  The memo function, for instance, arbitrarilylimits entries to 2,048 characters, and word wrap takes effect only after youstore and recall an entry for the first time.andM;Even so, because of its strong and growing third-party software support, theWizard is well worth considering as an adjunct to a desktop or laptop PC.andO;Several of the already available software titles are designed to integratewith desktop software, and more are undoubtedly on the way.andP;  And as Nictrix'sToolkit demonstrates, the Wizard's touch screen has vast potential as aproductivity tool.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
