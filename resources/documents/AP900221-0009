The whale washed ashore about nine days ago at el-Omeid about 55miles west of this Mediterranean city but had not been removed byTuesday because officials in Alexandria claimed the half-buriedcarcass was not in their province but in that of Mersa Matruh.   Mersa Matruh is unequipped to deal with the body of such a largeanimal, which rarely appears in Egypt's Mediterranean waters. Thelast time a dead whale was washed ashore in Egypt was in 1936, saidSherif Ramadan at the Oceanography Institute.   An official at Alexandria's fire department said that if MersaMatruh asked for help, it would send firefighters with cranes alongwith butchers to cut up the whale's body, which was sodisintegrated it could not be lifted whole.</TEXT></DOC>
