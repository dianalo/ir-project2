A month after Black Monday, many public and private economists say the plunge will trim 1988 GNP growth by about one percentage point, largely because of a loss of household wealth and consumer confidence. A survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators finds the consensus forecast falling to 1.9% real growth from 2.8% before the crash.    Reagan adviser Sprinkel says the crash will have a &quot;deterring effect on the willingness of consumers to increase spending.&quot; But a slowdown in consumer outlays would also mean less spending on imports, helping to narrow the trade deficit. And economists say the drop in interest rates since the crash should help prevent a downturn.    &quot;We won't get a full-fledged recession if nothing worse happens,&quot; says Shearson Lehman economist Allen Sinai, &quot;just a significant dent in growth.&quot;    SOVIET SATELLITES feel aftershocks from Moscow's upheavals.    In the wake of Gorbachev ally Yeltsin's ouster, East Europeans don't know how reformist they should be or how secure Gorbachev is in power. Conservative leaders in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, possibly acting as front men for Kremlin hard-liners who don't dare attack Gorbachev themselves, express qualms about his course.    Some analysts see possible East European disturbances next year. Poland and Hungary will be raising consumer prices, always a touchy political move; Romania's economy remains in deep trouble. &quot;The social tensions will be very high, and an unexpected incident could easily set something off,&quot; says Jan Vanous, a Washington-based expert on East-bloc economies.    WRIGHT WALKS a political tightrope -- and a misstep could be fatal.    Despite the administration's public pummeling of the speaker over Central America, he helped himself on Capitol Hill by asserting Congress's role. &quot;It may have raised some questions out in the country, but people liked it up here,&quot; says an aide to Oklahoma Rep. McCurdy. But Wright remains vulnerable to twists in the peace process: If Costa Rica's Arias criticizes Nicaragua, Wright could find himself in the middle.    Wright has little reservoir of good will in the House. His ties to special interests leave many members uneasy. Republicans blast him for hardball political tactics and for freezing them out of key budget and tax talks. Yet he may wind up needing their support to pass any deficit reduction package; mistrustful liberals in his own party may bolt over defense and other issues.    Democrats say the speaker fails to keep even his allies informed of his intentions. &quot;He's a real loner,&quot; says one senior Democrat.    PEACE PROCESS? White House aides, still seething at Wright, also are irritated at Shultz for making peace with the speaker. Officials complain that the secretary of state made the decision to make up largely on his own, and didn't let the White House in on his plans soon enough.    PARTY FAVORS: House Democratic campaign chairman Beryl Anthony draws fire for asking Republican real-estate mogul Donald Trump to host the Democrats' fund-raising dinner. Anthony also comes under attack for backing special-interest tax provisions for potential contributors, and is one of five Ways and Means Democrats pushing a cut in the capital-gains tax rate to 15%.    REAGAN PLANS a public pledge that he won't trade away his Strategic Defense Initiative for a broader deal with the Soviets on nuclear weapons. Aides hope the strong statement, planned for a speech in Denver next Tuesday, will quell opposition to the treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces by convincing conservatives that it isn't a first step toward giving up SDI.    BOWEN SEEKS to get HHS on the front line of the AIDS public-relations battle. Besides his own breakfast meetings with reporters, the secretary directs HHS officials to hold biweekly AIDS press briefings. Officials hope to take the spotlight back from the more conservative Education Secretary Bennett and from White House aides.    REPUBLICANS FRET as GOP presidential candidates savage each other.    The old party &quot;11th Commandment -- &quot;speak no ill of another Republican -- falls by the wayside. Kemp accuses Dole of supporting an oil-import fee that supposedly would cost every New Hampshire homeowner $240 a winter. Dole attacks Bush as a dilettante. Bush's forces fire at Robertson, but others shy away from taking Robertson on for fear of arousing his evangelical followers.    The infighting does the most damage to back-of-the-pack candidates like du Pont, Haig and, increasingly, Kemp. Some party leaders want Reagan to step in and tell the candidates to cool the attacks. But a scheduled White House meeting with the contenders has been indefinitely postponed.    An unorthodox du Pont ad shows Bush and Kemp assailing his controversial Social Security plan. &quot;We ought to report it as an in-kind contribution,&quot; says Kemp spokesman John Buckley.    MINOR MEMOS: Fragrance heir and Ambassador to Austria Ronald Lauder, angling for a Senate race in heavily Jewish New York, sends journalists copies of a book about Jews in Europe. . . . Faint praise: A GOP newsletter calls Nevada Sen. Hecht &quot;a man whose accomplishments are unknown even to many in Washington.&quot; . . . Playing on his reputation as a tightwad, a Quincy, Mass., restaurant's billboard boasts: &quot;Food for a King. Prices for a Dukakis.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
