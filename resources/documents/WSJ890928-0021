The company earned $1.2 million in each of the year-earlier quarters. Mountaineer expects profit for 1989 to decline 30% from the $4.6 million it earned last year.    The bank said the additional loan-loss provisions were caused by bad car loans at a subsidiary, Old Nationwide Bank, in Martinsburg, W.Va., where Mountaineer is based.    Mountaineer also announced a restructuring program. The company said it is merging Morgan County State Bank with Old Nationwide Bank, and it is eliminating $1.5 million in overhead expense. Staff levels will be reduced by 400 people, or about 8% of the work force. </TEXT></DOC>
