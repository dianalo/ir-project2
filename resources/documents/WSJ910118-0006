The assault on Iraq is a long way from over, but itsinitial, ongoing ferocity shows that no one has learned thelessons of Vietnam better than the U.S. military. Virtuallywithout exception, America's Desert Storm generals, and eachof its 13 leading field commanders, fought in Vietnam. Somewere wounded in battle (army Gen. Barry McCaffrey lost anarm); all were educated by it. They have taken thatexperience and molded it into a battle plan of overwhelmingforce, overwhelmingly delivered.</LP><TEXT>   This is a war necessary to remove Saddam Hussein as aMiddle East threat. But the tragedy is that 30 years ago warmight not have been necessary to remove a Saddam. If anAmerican president had put 400,000 troops in the Middle Eastin the 1950s, an aggressor would have backed down. Vietnammade the world doubt. Saddam has resisted for six monthsbecause he thinks he can outlast us, as others did in Vietnamand Lebanon. He has misjudged both George Bush and America'sgenerals.   Caspar Weinberger, the former defense secretary, recallstalking with his then-military aide, Colin Powell, during the1983 Marine deployment and bombing in Lebanon. &quot;We had manyconversations about it, and he agreed with me that theMarines had no clear purpose there,&quot; says Cap.   William Taylor, a retired colonel and now a militaryanalyst at the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies, taught Gen. Powell at the National War College inthe 1970s. &quot;Most of the students with him thought that theywere sent to Vietnam to do a job without clear goals and withpolitical restrictions,&quot; says Mr. Taylor. &quot;This time, they'resaying, Let's get it right.&quot;   No one is in a better position to get it right than Gen.Powell, who served two army tours in Vietnam. A soothingpersonality, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has madehimself part of President Bush's small inner circle ofadvisers. He's also skillfully exploited an obscure 1986defense reorganization, Goldwater-Nichols, to make himselfperhaps the most politically dominant general since GeorgeMarshall in the 1940s.   The joint staff that used to report to other generals nowreports to him. The military chain of command is also morestreamlined, reporting directly from Norman Schwarzkopf inSaudi Arabia to him. So Gen. Powell has the authority, if hechooses to use it, to avoid the sort of interservice rivalrythat proved so damaging in Grenada.   In Vietnam, then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamaramicromanaged &quot;every bomb drop,&quot; as one former general putsit. In designing this still-unfolding battle plan, PresidentBush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney left it up to thegenerals. Once they had designed it, Mr. Cheney spent a dayand a half in Riyadh in December asking tough questions. Butafter he (and Mr. Bush) approved the plan, implementation wasleft to the generals.   That plan has the clear objective lacking in Vietnam:Destroy Saddam's military capacity and clear him from Kuwait.It also has domestic support, represented by the vote fromCongress.   And from the first week of the military buildup in August,Gen. Powell has advised that if force is to be used it shouldbe applied quickly and massively. Mr. Bush's Nov. 8 decisionto double the deployment was based on advice from both Gens.Schwarzkopf and Powell about &quot;what they needed to win,&quot; asone military source puts it. Now they're being given theauthority to execute that plan to the hilt -- no &quot;pauses&quot; formisguided diplomacy, no political meddling that would onlyraise casualties.   It's always possible, of course, that today's generalshave learned some lessons too well. Some critics worry aboutthe generals' Vietnam-inspired belief in the public'simpatience; this might induce them to accept a quick butmurderous ground attack on Iraqi troops in Kuwait.   But as former Air Force chief of staff Michael Dugan says,&quot;I remember the exact moment the U.S. public turned againstVietnam: The week Life magazine published the photographs ofall of the previous week's casualties.&quot; Desert Storm'sgenerals understand the political cost of casualties.   Civilian leadership is also needed to overcome themilitary's bureaucratic instincts. The Tomahawk cruisemissiles that silently struck Iraqi targets were once opposedby the Navy brass. Cruise missiles also nearly died in theSALT &quot;arms control process&quot; of the 1970s.   But in actually fighting a war, the Bush administrationhas learned the lesson of Vietnam, too. As one sourcedescribes Secretary Cheney's view, &quot;his doctrine of war is,don't screw around.&quot; For 20 years, says anotheradministration official, two &quot;lessons&quot; of Vietnam havecompeted for dominance in the public mind. One -- stillprominent among Democrats -- is that U.S. militaryintervention carries the seeds of its own failure.   The competing lesson is that military force can well serveU.S. purposes if political leaders provide clear goals anddon't obstruct the mission. What a splendid irony it will beif Colin Powell buries not only Saddam Hussein, but also onceand for all the false lessons of Vietnam.</TEXT></DOC>
