Man, It's Outta Sight   ALL THAT Charles Lave wanted was to find the best videocassette recorder on the market, which he planned to give to friends as a wedding-anniversary gift. So the University of California economist turned to the March issue of Consumer Reports magazine, which rated VCRs.    What could be simpler? Maybe finding a lost continent.    First, says Mr. Lave, he determined that the VCR with the highest overall rating was RCA model VPT391, produced by Indianapolis-based Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc. Next he began to call local VCR dealers -- all of whom told him that the VPT391 doesn't exist. &quot;Then they either hung up or tried to switch me to some Japanese brand that was on special,&quot; he reports.    But Mr. Lave persisted. Eventually, he says, a Thomson official advised him that the VPT391 had been a limited-production model and that he should look for the nearly identical VPT390. By then, however, Mr. Lave was so miffed that he fired off a letter to Thomson denigrating the company's marketing abilities. &quot;That Consumer Reports top recommendation was a windfall which has been squandered,&quot; he wrote.    A Thomson spokesman doesn't dispute that but notes that the VPT390 and three variants -- including the elusive 391 -- were about eight months old when Consumer Reports published its ratings. For its part, Consumer Reports regrets having tested an aging, limited-edition model. &quot;Our pre-publication checks usually flush out such problems before we go to press,&quot; says John J. Hanc, director of market services.    As for Mr. Lave, he still hasn't bought his gift. But he has decided against any kind of VCR.    Extra! Extra! Execs   Are Shocked by Article! -   IN MOST CIRCLES, the front page of The Wall Street Journal isn't regarded as remarkably risque. Then there are the circles at Ryder System Inc., a company best known for its truck-rental operations.    Ryder's 1987 annual report features a photo of a man reading The Wall Street Journal. It is -- or was -- the real Journal, but it's an altered version. In the left-hand column of the front page that day had been an article about Seagram Co.; in the Ryder picture, that article has been replaced by a page-two piece about Texaco.    What happened? It seems that when the photo was taken the only Journal at hand was the one with the Seagram article. And, says a Ryder spokesman, &quot;We simply didn't think that having a liquor company in our annual report was in keeping with the kind of image we want to project.&quot;    Another Ryder insider suggests privately that the switch may have been dictated by a different reason: the Mormonism of Ryder's chairman, M. Anthony Burns. The Ryder spokesman denies that. &quot;Tony's a . . . good Mormon,&quot; he says, &quot;but he doesn't wear it on his sleeve.&quot;    A Seagram spokeswoman says: &quot;It sounds like you've got a couple of odd people over there {at Ryder}.&quot; Beyond that, she says, &quot;We don't think it's worthy of comment.&quot;    The Phony Reviewer   And the Fake Lawyer   COMPUTER MAKERS try hard to have their wares reviewed in magazines for computer users. Sometimes they try too hard.    Recently, American Research Corp., a California maker of IBM-compatible personal computers was approached by a self-described free-lance writer who said he would like to review an American Research machine. Would the company please send him one of its computers? Of course it would; a $7,000 PC was handed over without further ado.    And then the company waited for results -- and waited. Repeated calls to the reviewer were picked up by a telephone-answering service and went unreturned.    The machine was also unreturned and, of course, unreviewed. So Anne Harbin, the company's media specialist, decided to fight fake with fake: She had a company salesman call the answering service and say he was an attorney. The &quot;lawyer&quot; admonished the operator for fronting for a crime and threatened legal action unless the computer was returned. The machine was mailed back a few days later.    Ms. Harbin says that her boss lent out this particular machine. She herself demands that potential reviewers provide references, published articles and an editor's letter commissioning a story. &quot;If I get all that back, I know they're legitimate,&quot; she says.    She has two more rules: She is skeptical about requests from makers of obscure movies to borrow computers as props, and she is wary of requests that come in envelopes postmarked in prisons.    Odds and Ends -   CHRYSLER CORP. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca listened at the company's annual meeting last week as shareholder Gerald J. O'Grady talked at length about Chrysler's need for a smoking policy. Mr. Iacocca, a two-cigar-a-day smoker, replied that the company would develop such a policy within 30 days. Then the chairman, who lives in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, added: &quot;You must be a neighbor, you're from Bloomfield Hills, I hear. Well, come over for a smoke sometime, huh?&quot; . . . Most of Canada's bank analysts have been in a ticklish spot since last summer's financial deregulation ushered in a wave of bank takeovers of the nation's largest securities dealers. Since then, many securities firms have warned their analysts against publicly criticizing their parent bank's performance. But some analysts still carp. In her latest report on Canada's banks, Nesbitt Thomson Inc.'s Mary Hallward chastises the firm's parent, Bank of Montreal, for excessive costs. The bank analyst hastens to add: &quot;This higher cost structure would not be reduced by elimination of the bank analyst's salary.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
