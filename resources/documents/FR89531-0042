Horizontal drilling will allow reservoirs which havenot been fully developed to be very effectively stimulated and make possiblethe economical recovery of oil and gas reserves where it has not been previouslypossible. The intended research is to obtain the mineral rights (leasehold),for a lease in the North Flatrock Field, Osage County Oklahoma; obtainand install fluid separation and oil storage facilities (tank battery);acquire salt water disposal facilities; drill, equip, and produce a horizontalwell; and report on work performed and results obtained. The Departmentof Energy will have constant access to all drilling and production dataproduced by Rougeot which relates to this research. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.14 (D) and (E), Rougeot Oil and Gas Corporationhas been selected as the grant recipient. This activity would be conductedby Rougeot Oil and Gas Corporation based on the meritorious applicationof the general evaluation. DOE support of the activity would enhance thepublic benefits to be derived by increasing domestic oil producing rates.This activity represents an unique idea and a method which would not beeligible for financial assistance under solicitation, and, as determinedby DOE, a competitive solicitation would be inappropriate. The terms of the grant is for a one-year period at an estimated value of$213,295. The DOE share is anticipated at $153,295, the remainder, or $60,000,to be nonfederal monies provided by Rougeot Oil and Gas Corporation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>U.S. Department of Energy, PittsburghEnergy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Division, P.O.
