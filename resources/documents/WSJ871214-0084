Reports have been appearing for some time now describing difficulties both immigrants and employers have had complying with the law. Recently, Manor Care Inc., a motel and nursing-home operator, was cited by the immigration service for violating the law. Manor Care vowed to mount the first big legal challenge to the law, which has hit the lodging industry hard, but instead settled, agreeing to stop hiring undocumented workers. Now, however, the immigration law has found a significant foe in a former supporter -- Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago.    &quot;This law is fundamentally flawed,&quot; the cardinal said last week, &quot;and simply is not doing what it was established to do.&quot; Cardinal Bernardin said the law was breaking up immigrant families and that its documentation for legal-residence applications was burdensome. Moreover, the Hispanic Caucus of the Chicago Archdiocese has urged employers to still hire undocumented workers.    Cardinal Bernardin wants the law fixed. He may discover, however, that this unfortunate law is hardly an exceptional product of the modern congressional legislative process. The cardinal, for instance, might consult anyone covered by the environmental-protection act. He and the immigrants will find that Congress creates these administrative horrors, walks away and lets the covered parties seek redress in the courts, in perpetuity. </TEXT></DOC>
