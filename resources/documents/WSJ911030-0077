These barriers are not theresult of the Gulf War or inadequate consumer demand. Theyare not something the Federal Reserve can overcome byprinting money in vain attempts to manipulate interest rates.The only way out of the muddle is to pull tax and regulatorybarriers down.   Before addressing the tax proposals now on the table inWashington, I'd like to review the sources of the damage andpropose some solutions. Taxes on labor must fall ifemployment is to recover soon from recent losses. The recentincrease in the minimum wage to $4.25 from $3.35 raised thecost of labor, as did the rise in the top income tax ratemandated by the 1990 budget agreement (whenever marginal taxrates rise, gross wages must rise to compensate). The 1988and 1990 payroll tax increases (to 15.3% from 14.3%, paidhalf by the employer and half by employee) also lifted laborcosts. In addition, the 1990 budget agreement provided for anextra jump in the taxable Social Security wage base -- andfor a large increase in the amount of wages subject to the2.9% Medicare portion of the tax rate.</LP><TEXT>   These shocks could not be absorbed without a sharp fall inemployment. The payroll tax changes alone cost the economymore than 500,000 jobs. They also helped bring us a situationin which Americans are earning less than they once did.   Lowering the marginal tax rate on labor is an importantstep to cutting labor costs and raising work incentives. Oneway to do this is to cut the marginal tax rates on individualincome. The John Kennedy-Lyndon Johnson tax cuts in the early1960s took this route and proved effective at generatingjobs. Ronald Reagan's tax cuts did the same. Both reformsshowed how crucial it was to cut taxes at the margin-in allbrackets. Currently, though, payroll tax rates for manyAmericans are higher than income tax rates. So reducing thepayroll tax rate might be the marginal rate cut of choicenow.   The second area of concern is the cost of capital. TheEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 sharply reduced the returna piece of capital investment had to earn to pay its taxesand produce a profit. But tax increases in 1982 and 1984 didmuch to limit these growth incentives. In 1986 came the worstdamage. The Tax Reform Act of that year did away with theinvestment tax credit, cut the value of depreciationallowances by lengthening asset lives, and raised the maximumrate of tax on capital gains.   These changes have deprived the economy of some $300billion in investment over the past five years, directlytrimming about one percentage point off the rate of growth ingross national product, and indirectly cutting growth ofemployment and wages. Another result was the collapse of realestate prices, and the resulting expensive burdens of thesavings-and-loan and bank mess. The collapse of bank lendingis probably what tipped the balance from feeble growth tooutright recession.   The two most powerful approaches to cutting the cost ofcapital are lowering the tax rate on capital gains andbeefing up depreciation allowances. To spur growth, thecapital-gains tax rate should be cut drastically, to no morethan 15% for assets held one year or longer. The basis ofcapital assets should also be adjusted for inflation, so thatpeople aren't paying taxes on gains that aren't really there.   Although this is hardly the most important argument forsuch a cut, cutting the capital-gains tax rate would raiserevenue. A large number of people would realize capital gainsthat would otherwise be locked in. Moreover, the tax-ratereduction would be capitalized by a jump in the price ofstock shares, increasing the amount of gains available to betaken.   More important would be the positive effects on economicgrowth, which would yield revenues too. In effect, thecurrent system of taxing capital gains as ordinary income hasthe effect of taxing retained corporate earnings andreinvested income of unincorporated businesses twice, much asdividends are taxed twice. The effect is to increase the taxon shareholders' and proprietors' saving by severalpercentage points.   Another step is reform of depreciation schedules. The taxcode currently forces firms to write off capital assets overthree, five, seven, 10, 15 or 20 years for equipment, and upto 31 years for structures. Delaying write-offs for theselong periods reduces their value, and raises the aftertaxcost of the asset. At a 3.5% real return and about 4%inflation, the present value of the write-offs equals only88% of the cost of a five-year asset, 84% of the cost of aseven-year asset, 77% of the cost of a 10-year asset, andonly about 40% of the cost of a building. On its equipmentspending, a firm is lucky if its write-offs average 85% ofits costs. By my estimates, the shortfall is more than $60billion a year on equipment alone, costing businesses morethan $20 billion a year in over-taxation.   Capital consumption allowances should be boosted untiltheir present value is equal to writing off the entireinvestment in the first year. This is called &quot;expensing&quot; andwould eliminate the shortfall described above and be worthabout as much as a 5% investment tax credit. There should becorresponding changes to prevent these incentives from beingundone by the alternative minimum tax. Investment decisionsdepend on whether the present value of the returns on aninvestment exceed its cost. Enhanced depreciation can bedistributed over the lifetimes of the capital assets so as tocost nothing over the five-year federal budget period, whilestill providing a boost to present value that would create animmediate incentive to undertake several hundred billiondollars of added investment.   How do the proposals that are flying around Washingtonstack up? Many of them, unfortunately, turn their backs ongrowth and focus on redistributing income.   In the redistribution category are Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's(D., Texas) proposal for a $300 tax credit to families foreach child under age 19, Rep. Frank Wolf's (R., Va.) proposalto increase the personal exemption for children to $3500, andSen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.) and Rep. Thomas Downey's (D.,N.Y.) proposal to convert the personal exemption to arefundable credit and raise the top income tax rates to payfor it.   Neither the children's credit nor the exemption increasewould reduce the marginal tax rate on wages and salaries. TheGore-Downey proposal would raise marginal tax rates on themost productive employees, and be a clear job loser.   These so-called pro-family initiatives merely move moneyaround. They will not create jobs. Any argument that such taxcuts would boost aggregate demand is mistaken. Tax cuts donot operate that way. Either the government would borrow themoney back, or pay for it through spending reduction (e.g.,defense cuts in the Bentsen bill) or offsetting tax increases(Gore-Downey). In no case would aggregate spending rise.Besides, demand is not the problem.   There's more hope in the proposals that cut the cost oflabor. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's (D., N.Y.) plan tolower the payroll tax rate is a start in the right direction,but errs by raising the rate later. A better bet is the billsponsored by Reps. Tom DeLay (R., Texas) and Robin Tallon(D., S.C.) and Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wy.). That bill wouldcut the payroll tax rate once and for all. A proposal by Sen.William Roth (R., Del.) would cut all three marginal incometax rates by three percentage points on incomes below $1million. These plans do the right thing: They cut labor costs&quot;at the margin&quot; and promote work effort. The payroll tax cutswould create half a million jobs, the income tax rate morethan a million jobs.   On the cost of capital, DeLay-Tallon-Wallop is the best.Its so-called neutral cost recovery system for equipmentadjusts the portion of depreciation write-offs not taken inthe first year for inflation and a real return of 3.5%, ineffect paying interest on the unused balance of a write-off.This increases the present value of the write-offs to that offirst-year expensing. With minor adjustments, the neutralcost recovery system could provide an enormous boost toinvestment with no cost during the budget period. Beyond thebudget period, the bill accelerates write-offs until actualfirst-year expensing is achieved.   DeLay-Tallon-Wallop also includes the appropriatetreatment for capital gains: a clean cut in the tax rate oncapital gains to 15% on assets held one year (7.5% for thosein the 15% income tax bracket), plus indexing for inflation.This is a far better proposal than the administration's plan,which does not adjust for inflation and lowers the top taxrate on capital-gains to only 19.6% after a three-yearholding period for a taxpayer in the 28% bracket.   But the economy needs bold action. It is time to realizethat it is better to give a family a job or a raise than ahandout, and easier to balance the budget when the economy isstrong than when it is weak.   ---   Mr. Entin is resident scholar at the Washington-basedInstitute for Research on the Economics of Taxation.</TEXT></DOC>
