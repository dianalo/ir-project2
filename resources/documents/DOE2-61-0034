These forces occur in current-carryingplasmas with curvature. The model loop is characterized by twisted magnetic-fieldlines. The magnetic field and current density have toroidal and poloidalcomponents. A current loop was assumed to evolve while maintaining ahalf-torus configuration. The important geometrical constraint that footpointsare generally immobile on the relevant time scales was not taken intoaccount. The dynamical properties of current loops similar to those ofthe earlier work are examined with the requirement that the footpointsremain stationary in the photosphere. The behavior of the present, more-realisticmodel is qualitatively similar to that of the earlier model. In particular,the velocities the apex can achieve under the action of toroidal forcesand the magnetic energy released in the form of drag heating are similarin their respective magnitudes. In this calculation, the ratio eta ofthe height of the apex and the footpoint separation is a physical parameter.It is found that a low-lying loop (small eta) can evolve to a taller(larger eta) loop in a quasi-equilibrium fashion if the current is increasedslowly while holding the footpoint separation fixed. Time evolution ofthe loops and the magnetic energy converted via drag heating are presented.Results are also presented for loops with relatively strong current.It appears that the toroidal forces can lead to a wide range of plasmamotion. The accompanying drag heating can take place with a correspondinglywide range of rates.</TEXT></DOC>
