Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger said he would set up a panel toanalyze criticisms voiced about the 625,000-strong army.   The ``Switzerland has no army'' constitutional amendment wasfavored by 35.6 percent, or 1,052,218 of those who cast ballots.Opposed were 64.4 percent, or 1,903,797.   Polls had predicted the proposal would win a maximum 30 percentsupport.   Voter turnout was 69 percent, the highest for a referendum sincethe 1971 measure that gave women the right to vote.   The government urged people to oppose the law, arguing thatSwiss neutrality and independence could only be guaranteed by acredible defense force.   Villiger said he did not regard the high number of votes infavor of the proposal as a defeat. ``The relaxation of tensionwhich happily dominates the international scene was probably onefactor'' for the support, he told reporters.   But supporters of the proposal were stunned by their success.   ``The result is unbelievable,'' said Andreas Gross, spokesmanfor the ``Switzerland Without an Army Group'' which collected the100,000 signatures necessary to force the referendum.   ``If 500,000 people can bring changes in Prague, then the highproportion of yes votes should give the Swiss government food forthought,'' he said, referring to the pro-democracy movement inCzechoslovakia.   The Social Democratic Party, describing the vote as``sensational,'' called for an examination of defense policies. Asa priority, the law should be changed to allow conscientiousobjectors to perform civilian duties, a statement from the partysaid.   Of the four parties in Switzerland's governing coalition, theSocial Democrats were alone in not urging rejection of theproposal. They decided not to take a stand on the issue.   The Swiss military establishment is rooted in centuries-oldtradition. Even though the country has not fought in foreign warssince 1515, it can field more men per square mile than any othercountry in the world apart from Israel.   Switzerland has more artillery pieces than its much largerneighbor West Germany and a fleet of battle tanks half that ofFrance.   The Defense Ministry says military defense costs total about$3.1 billion a year.   Army opponents say costs are nearer $6.3 billion, taking intoaccount salaries in defense-related areas and the cost toprivate-sector employers of releasing staff for the annual call-up.   Currently, every Swiss man is required to do military service,starting with 17 weeks of basic training at age 20, followed by 13call-ups of two to three weeks until age 50. In a bid to relievepressure on the country's tight labor market, the defense ministrythis year announced reforms to end military service at the age of42 by 1995.   Before the vote, Villiger acknowledged that the unpopularity ofthe compulsory basic recruit training was one of the reasons forthe high percentage of young people expected to support the no-armyinitiative.   In a recent survey of young recruits by a Swiss magazine, eventhose who said they would vote against the proposal called forreforms in military service. Many cited their dislike of blindlyfollowing orders.   The vote followed weeks of impassioned debate, rare in normallyreserved Switzerland.   Supporters of the army maintained Switzerland's defense tacticsspared the country the horrors of involvement in World War II.   Others argued Switzerland stayed neutral because it curriedHitler's favor by supplying foreign exchange and arms to theGermans.   In a second referendum Sunday, voters rejected by anunexpectedly large majority of 62 percent a proposal to raisenational speed limits.   The draft law aimed to raise the speed limit on highways from120 to 130 kilometers per hour (75 to 81 mph) and on main roadsfrom 80 to 100 kilometers per hour (50 to 62 mph).</TEXT></DOC>
