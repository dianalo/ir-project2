The two-story brick home, deeded to the singer in 1972 by herthen-husband Theodore White, was condemned last year by the city.Now, the yard is overgrown and littered with fliers, and there is ahole in the screen door.   ``We live in a nice neighborhood, but Aretha Franklin doesn'tcare about us,'' said Theodora Stewart, a neighbor behind the house.   Franklin, who lives in Bloomfield Hills, couldn't be reached forcomment. There was no answer this morning at the office of herattorney, Harvey Tennen.   City records show the house was bought by White and Franklin for$18,500 in 1967, when they were married. The market value of thehouse and land is about $42,500.</TEXT></DOC>
