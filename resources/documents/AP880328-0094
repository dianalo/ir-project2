Joseph Douze, second in command of the centrist ChristianDemocratic Party, was arrested Saturday and charged in connectionwith last week's blast under the Croix des Bouquets Bridge. Theexplosion Tuesday caused no damage or injuries, party leader SylvioClaude confirmed.   Claude said Douze, a medical doctor with dual Haitian andAmerican citizenship, had been planted in the party by thegovernment. Douze, who had served as the party's provisional vicepresident, was expelled, Claude said.   Douze was filmed by the state television station Saturday nightduring a search of his home by soldiers.   The Americans, Nancy Horn, of Wells Tannley, Pa., and JamesGunnels, of Macon, Ga., told The Associated Press in a telephoneinterview that they were friends of Douze's and were staying at hishome in Thomassin, outside Port-au-Prince, at the time of hisarrest.   Horn identified herself as an associate of Douze and said shehad been in Haiti since 1967. Gunnels said he was a businessmanvisiting the country.   The officer in charge of the search of Douze's home said onstate television Sunday the two Americans ``have a certainresponsibility in the affair.'' The officer did not elaborate.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite said U.S. consular officialshad been in contact with Horn and Gunnels and that he did not knowif they would be formally arrested although they had been barredfrom leaving the house.   Horn and Gunnels said they did not know anything about thebombing.   ``I know nothing about this affair,'' Gunnels said. ``I was justa guest in his home for a few days.''   The two said they had been treated well by the army.   Horn said Douze was in his mid-40s and of Haitian origin and hadlived several years in the United States during the Duvalierdictatorship, which lasted from 1957 to 1986.   Claude accused the government of President Leslie Manigat ofplanting members in his party to try to discredit and destroy it.Claude, a Protestant pastor, was one of the four most popularpresidential candidates in the Nov. 29 elections suspended becauseof widespread violence.   The state-run Television Nationale reported Sunday that Douzewas arrested for possession of detonators, wiring for explosives, aremote control detonating device, ammunition and clips forautomatic assault rifles.   On Wednesday the Christian Democratic Party's head of security,Jocelin Brochard, a former army corporal, and two women werearrested in connection with the bombing of the bridge. Severalsticks of dynamite, two assault rifles and a large bag of marijuanawere found stashed on the roof of the women's home in thePort-au-Prince slum of Bel-Air.   Brochard said on state televison last week that Douze suppliedthe weapons.   Claude denied knowing that Brochard or Douze were involved inthe bombing, but said some members of the party who have advocatedviolence have been expelled in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
