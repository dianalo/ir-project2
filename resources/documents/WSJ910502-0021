The pope leaves no doubt that there areindeed many new things to be taken into account.   &quot;Centesimus&quot; is a ringing endorsement of the marketeconomy. The endorsement is, however, joined to powerfulchallenges.</LP><TEXT>   The pope writes, &quot;Can it perhaps be said that, after thefailure of Communism, capitalism is the victorious socialsystem, and that capitalism should be the goal of thecountries now making efforts to rebuild their economy andsociety?&quot; The answer: If by capitalism is meant the&quot;primitive&quot; and often &quot;ruthless&quot; system criticized by LeoXIII a century ago, &quot;the reply is certainly negative.&quot; Butthen this: &quot;If by capitalism is meant an economic systemwhich recognizes the fundamental and positive role ofbusiness, the market, private property, and the resultingresponsibility for the means of production, as well as freehuman creativity in the economic sector, then the answer iscertainly in the affirmative.&quot;   John Paul affirms a &quot;new capitalism. But the term heprefers is simply &quot;free economy.&quot; Of course socialism iseconomically disastrous, but what he calls the &quot;evil&quot; of thesystem imposed by the communist &quot;empire&quot; is its denial offreedom. Readers will miss the gravamen of this encyclical ifthey do not recognize that it is, first and most importantly,an argument about human nature. Capitalism is the economiccorollary of the Christian understanding of man's nature anddestiny.   The pope says that we can now see how prescient Leo XIIIwas in his scathing critique of the socialist idea 100 yearsago. John Paul underscores, too, &quot;Rerum Novarum's&quot; vigorousdefense of private property as essential to human freedom,dignity and prosperity. According to the pope's argument,interpretations of Catholic social teaching along socialistor semisocialist lines, together with the idea that thechurch proposes a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism andsocialism, are in serious error.   The present encyclical must surely prompt a careful, andperhaps painful, rethinking of conventional wisdoms aboutCatholic social teaching. It may be, for instance, that thecontrolling assumptions of the American bishops' 1986pastoral letter, &quot;Economic Justice for All,&quot; must now berecognized as unrepresentative of the church's authoritativeteaching.   John Paul repeatedly insists that economic growth and theproduction of wealth are essential to economic justice.Private property must be put to its proper purpose:&quot;Ownership of the means of production . . . is just andlegitimate if it serves useful work. It becomes illegitimate,however, when it is not utilized or when it serves to impedethe work of others, in an effort to gain a profit which isnot the result of the overall expansion of work and thewealth of society.&quot;   The free economy in advanced societies is still not freeenough, says the pope. It must develop more fully to includelabor and management in a free &quot;community of work&quot; and&quot;circle of exchange&quot; in which business is viewed as a&quot;society of persons.&quot; At several points he emphasizes theimportance of trade unions, insisting, however, that theymust be genuinely free associations that are clear about &quot;theimpossible compromise between Christianity and Marxism.&quot;   The pope writes that Catholic social teaching, from &quot;RerumNovarum&quot; to the present, &quot;criticizes two social and economicsystems: socialism and liberalism.&quot; In the European manner,he means by liberalism what in this country is commonlycalled libertarianism. &quot;Centesimus&quot; is as hard on thelibertarians as it is on the socialists. While economics isimportant indeed, man must never be reduced to the merelyeconomic. The notion that the entirety of social life is tobe determined by market exchanges is to run &quot;the risk of an`idolatry' of the market, an idolatry which ignores theexistence of goods which by their nature are not and cannotbe mere commodities.&quot;   While the bulk of the 114 pages of the encyclical isdevoted to economics, its import is to deflate the importanceof the economic. Economics, politics, culture -- these threedefine the social order, and the greatest of these isculture. And at the heart of culture is the spiritual andmoral.   Capitalism, if it is to work, cannot be amoral. &quot;Importantvirtues are involved in this process,&quot; the pope writes, &quot;suchas diligence, industriousness, prudence in undertakingreasonable risks, reliability and fidelity in interpersonalrelationships, as well as courage in carrying out decisionswhich are difficult and painful but necessary, both for theoverall working of a business and in meeting possiblesetbacks.&quot;   The economics of freedom does not assume the practice ofunqualified altruism. The pope has no illusions about humannature. &quot;Man, who was created for freedom, bears withinhimself the wound of original sin which constantly draws himtowards evil and puts him in need of redemption.&quot;Self-interest is often wrongly perceived, but it cannot beeliminated. An economy that is fit for human nature must takelegitimate self-interest into account. &quot;The social order willbe all the more stable, the more . . . it does not place inopposition personal interest and the interests of society asa whole, but rather seeks ways to bring them into fruitfulharmony. In fact, where self-interest is violentlysuppressed, it is replaced by a burdensome system ofbureaucratic control which dries up the wellsprings ofinitiative and creativity.&quot;   Similarly, profit is not to be despised. &quot;The Churchacknowledges the legitimate role of profit as an indicationthat a business is functioning well.&quot; At the same time,&quot;profitability is not the only indicator of a firm'scondition.&quot; The &quot;most valuable asset&quot; of a company is itspeople. When they are &quot;humiliated and their dignityoffended,&quot; it is both &quot;morally impermissible&quot; and &quot;willeventually have negative repercussions on the firm's economicefficiency.&quot;   The pope points out that the production of wealth hasincreasingly less to do with the exploitation of naturalresources and more to do with the employment of humanresources -- with the intelligence, skills and creativity ofpeople who recognize that individual good and common good areinseparably joined in the expanding solidarity of &quot;thecommunity of work.&quot;   Despite his respect for the market mechanism, the pope isseverely, even harshly, critical of much in those advancedsocieties that do practice economic freedom. No proponent ofcapitalism should want to deny the justice of his critique,for the problem, John Paul makes abundantly clear, is notwith economic freedom but with the abuse of that freedom. Theremedies are essentially cultural, political and, finally,spiritual. He bitingly condemns the &quot;consumerism&quot; thatresults when &quot;freedom refuses to be bound to the truth andfalls into arbitrariness and ends up submitting itself to thevilest of passions, to the point of self-destruction.&quot; Thepractice of abortion, he observes several times, is analarming indicator of the degradation of human dignity.   Already in the days immediately prior to the release of&quot;Centesimus,&quot; those Catholics with a stake in protectinganti-capitalist prejudices claimed that John Paul is faultingcapitalism for the social sins that he deplores. That claimflies in the face of the pope's own words: &quot;These criticismsare directed not so much against an economic system asagainst an ethical and cultural system. . . . If economiclife is absolutized, if the production and consumption ofgoods become the center of social life and society's onlyvalue, the reason is to be found not so much in the economicsystem itself as in the fact that the entire socio-culturalsystem, by ignoring the ethical and religious dimension, hasbeen weakened, and ends up by limiting itself to theproduction of goods and services alone.&quot;   In other words, there is only so much that economics cando. The free market cannot produce the virtuous society thatthe economy itself requires. That is the task of culture and,most particularly, of morality and religion.   As economics is limited, so also is the role of politics.&quot;The State,&quot; the pope writes, &quot;has the task of determiningthe juridical framework within which economic affairs are tobe conducted, and thus of safeguarding the prerequisites of afree economy.&quot; Thus, for example, monopolies must not bepermitted to exclude competition in the market. The freeeconomy cannot be conducted in an &quot;institutional, juridicalor political vacuum.&quot; &quot;On the contrary, it presupposes sureguarantees of individual freedom and private property, aswell as a stable currency and efficient public services.&quot; Ina free society, the state is a servant with carefullycircumscribed duties.   John Paul is highly critical of the expansive ambitions ofgovernment in what he calls the &quot;Welfare State&quot; or the&quot;Social Assistance State.&quot; He reluctantly allows that in&quot;exceptional circumstances,&quot; mainly in economicallyundeveloped societies, the state may make &quot;supplementaryinterventions.&quot; But such interventions &quot;must be as brief aspossible, so as to avoid removing permanently from societyand business systems the functions which are properly theirs,and so as to avoid enlarging excessively the sphere of Stateintervention to the detriment of both economic and civilfreedom.&quot;   This insight is based on two principles that run throughthe encyclical. The first is the principle of priority. Theindividual, his free associations, and society itself are allprior to the state in both dignity and rights. The second isthe principle of subsidiarity: &quot;A community of a higher ordershould not interfere in the internal life of a community of alower order, depriving the latter of its functions, butrather should support it in case of need and help tocoordinate its activity with the activities of the rest ofsociety, always with a view to the common good.&quot;   While &quot;Centesimus&quot; is a ringing affirmation of the freeeconomy, there is nothing in it to justify complacency amongthe friends of capitalism. Socialism is dead, but &quot;the newcapitalism&quot; has hardly met the challenges raised by the pope.He presses three challenges with particular urgency. First,the principle of subsidiarity requires that advancedsocieties redesign their social policies to return power to&quot;the intermediate groups&quot; of family and voluntaryassociations. Social policies should be designed andimplemented at the levels nearest to those most immediatelyaffected by them.   Second, the pope offers a number of proposals for the moreeffective inclusion of poor nations in the world economy's&quot;community of work&quot; and &quot;circle of exchange.&quot; As thespiritual leader of nearly a billion Christians, most of thempoor, the pope necessarily has much to say about poverty. Thechief problem of the poor, he contends, is not capitalism buttheir &quot;marginalization&quot; from capitalism. While acknowledgingthe ways in which poor nations are responsible for their ownplight, John Paul insists that the more developed economiesmust do much more to address their marginalization.   Third, business leaders are called upon to disenthrallthemselves from the illusion that their decisions are morallyneutral. What business does either advances or impedes theprospect, nationally and globally, of &quot;a society of freework, of enterprise, and of participation.&quot; Each of us isaccountable to that common good and, finally, to the judgmentof God.   Far from being an uncritical blessing of the marketeconomy, then, the message of &quot;Centesimus Annus&quot; is that thework of &quot;the new capitalism&quot; has hardly begun.   ---   Mr. Neuhaus is editor in chief of First Things: A MonthlyJournal of Religion and Public Life, in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
