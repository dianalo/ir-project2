The president said that while he feels badly about the hostageslanguishing in the hands of pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon, thesituation should not be likened to the one that existed when he cameto office in January 1981.   Fifty-two Americans held hostage in Tehran were released on Jan.20, 1981 _ the same day Reagan was inaugurated and President JimmyCarter left office. Reagan had criticized Carter during the 1980campaign for having been unable to win the hostages' release.   On Jan. 7, 1980, while campaigning for the GOP presidentialnomination in the New Hampshire primary, Reagan said Carter'sresponse to the taking of American hostages in Iran was ``toosluggish.''   ``I believe it's appropriate to suggest that anything that hasbeen done by the administration so far, could have, should have,been done in the first hour,'' Reagan said. The United States shouldhave ordered an economic boycott, hesaid, and set a deadline beyondwhich the boycotted country could not go without serious harm toitself.   In today's interview, Reagan did not take back that criticism.   ``We were facing two very different situations,'' he said, notingthat in the earlier situation, more than 50 people had been held inan embassy, and that they had been kidnapped by the government ofIran. ``This is another one, in which some terrorist group haskidnapped several individuals,'' he said.   ``We know that any overt attempt at rescue, even if we did have ahint or a clue, could run the risk of their assassination orexecution before we could get them out,'' Reagan said. ``Therehasn't been a moment that this hasn't been on my mind. ... I thinkthe two situations are completely different.''   Reagan said, however, that at the end of Carter's term, ``I madea number of statements and so forth that were aimed at helping. Inother words, portraying myself and the things I said, to thatgovernment that was holding them, that maybe they'd rather deal withhim than wait and deal with me.''   During a wide-ranging half-hour interview in the Oval Office, oneof a spate that Reagan has granted as his presidency draws to anend, he also said:   _``A technical state of war does still exist'' between Israel andthe Arab nations and U.S. officials believe that ``peace can onlycome about when the principals themselves agree to negotiations.''   _He did not know of any presidential pardons ``that areimminent,'' although he did not rule out any eleventh-hour pardons.``It doesn't seem very likely,'' he said.   _He still believes that former White House aides Oliver L. Northand John M. Poindexter eventually will be cleared of any criminalwrongdoing in the Iran-Contra case and he believes trials shouldproceed so there will be no lingering doubt about their innocence.   _He appreciates the potential of U.S. military power and theresponsibility of a president, saying ``I don't think there has everbeen a moment'' in his eight-year presidency when he had to considerordering a nuclear attack.   ``I'm quite sure we'd never be the first to press the button,''Reagan said.   Reagan said he would not give unsolicited advice toPresident-elect Bush after leaving office Friday, but would try tohelp if asked.   On the question of U.S. dealings with the Soviet Union, Reagansaid he thought Bush would move forward on the issue of reducing thesuperpower stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons, but thatcaution should be used.   ``I think we have to realize that in these negotiations ...they're not just based on what someone says. They're based ondeeds,'' he said. ``And I think that George will be very preparedthere, based on what the deeds are.''   Reagan said he does not believe that he is less popular in Europethan Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as some polls have shown.   ``I can't quite accept that he's more popular than I am,'' Reagansaid.   The president criticized what he called a ``total mediadistortion'' of the nature of covert U.S. arms sales to Iran in1985-86 through Israel.   Reagan said that the initiative got under way ``at a time wheneveryone was saying that the ayatollah was not going to live out theweek.'' He repeated his oft-stated position that the sales ofanti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to elements in Iran did notamount to trading arms for hostages.   Reagan said U.S. arms were sold to moderates in Iran who would``turn it over, not to the revolutionary government of Iran, but tothe regular military, which had been created ... in large part bythe United States ... and it would give them the prestige they needif they were to be able to take over the government and establish ademocratic government there.''</TEXT></DOC>
