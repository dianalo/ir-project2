In applying the present method, the steady-statefresh-salt water interface and the seaward flow rate of fresh water werein fairly good agreement with those measured by the experiemnt of confinedaquifer. According to the numerical solution of the velocity distributionin the aquifer, it was shown that in the steady-state on salt water intrusionand dispersion, the inflow of salt into fresh-salt water boundary fromthe wedge point of salt water is flowed out to the seaward along thefresh-salt water interface with the land fresh water. About one yearafter the construction of the underground cavern, the severe groundwaterpollution due to salt water intrusion occured in the aquifer of the seaside from the center of the cavern. In unconfined aquifer, the orderof the permeability near the ground surface is 10{sup -4}cm/s. In thereal two-layered aquifer, in which the order of the permeability of thelower layers is 10{sup -6}cm/s, it can be said that the movement of salinewater is relatively slow even five years after the construction of thecavern, and that the problem of groundwater pollution will not arise.(11 figs, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
