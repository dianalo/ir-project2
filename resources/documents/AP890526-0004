In brief arrival remarks, Bush made no reference to reports thathe would use the NATO summit next week in Brussels _ his first aspresident _ to announce a reduction in U.S. troops in Europe.   Instead, he declared the United States wants a ``stronger andmore united Europe,'' and said he plans to be ``actively engaged inEastern Europe, promoting measures to encourage political andeconomic liberalization in Poland.''   Bush plans to visit Poland in July.   The dispute over short-range nuclear weapons has defiedresolution by the two main countries at odds _ West Germany,pressing for negotiations with the Soviets to rid Europe of suchweapons, and the United States, supported by Britain, wanting tokeep the weapons there and make them better.   Other members of the 16-nation NATO alliance have lined up onone side or the other, with a few stradding the fence.   Officials on all sides have sought to dismiss suggestions thatthe issue would seriously disrupt the summit, which was designed tocelebrate 40 years of Cold War unity against the Soviet Union.   As Bush left Washington, The Washington Times reported that heplanned to use the summit as the stage for announcing a reductionof up to 10 percent in U.S. troop strength in Europe, ``as many as34,000 troops.''   The Washington Post quoted sources in Saturday's editions assaying the administration is considering an offer to negotiate cutsin troop strength, aircraft and helicopters in Europe if the SovietUnion agrees to cuts in tanks, armored personnel carriers andartillery pieces.   Numerous administration officials, with Bush and back inWashington, said any word on that would have to come from thepresident himself.   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air ForceOne en route to Rome: ``Any ideas in this area would be one thepresident would want to discuss with the allies, he would raisewith his partners at this session before he discusses anythingpublicly. ... I am not confirming or denying any decisions.''   Fitzwater did not dispute the newspaper's account. He said Bush``will be discussing a lot of different ideas with the allies'' butthat he ``just can't speculate on what the conversations mightamount to or what the president might suggest.''   The White House spokesman also stressed Bush would make no moveon troop deployments in Europe without having consultations withNATO first.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, told CBS News that 10 percent ``is the probable amountof reduction that would occur if the Soviet Union accepted the NATOproposal on conventional arms control which is now tabled.''   In Bonn, West German spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said, ``Wehave no official word of such a decision.''   Bush, in comments just before leaving on his first trip toEurope as president, expressed hopes to see a Europe ``that istruly free, united and at peace.'' He repeated his desire to movebeyond any Cold War policy of containment ``to integrate the SovietUnion into the community of nations.''   ``We welcome the political and economic liberalization that hastaken place so far in the Soviet Union and in some countries ofEastern Europe. We watch hoping that more changes will follow.''   As for the Western military alliance, he said, ``NATO has been asuccess by any measure but success breeds its own challenges.Today, dramatic changes are taking place in Europe, East and West.For us, those changes bring new challenges and unparalleledopportunities.''   In remarks prepared for his arrival in Rome, he praisedU.S.-Italy ties of friendship and said, ``The United Stateswelcomes a stronger and more united Europe.''   Several weeks of busy diplomacy, including a high-level meetingin Bonn and two others in Washington, failed to settle the missilesissue, a subject that Secretary of State James A. Baker III called``extraordinarily important.''   The issue is whether the United States and the Soviet Unionshould negotiate to reduce and possibly eliminate all theshort-range nuclear missiles NATO and the Warsaw Pact have deployedon European soil or delay indefinitely while the two militaryalliances negotiate over reductions in troops, tanks, artillery andother conventional armories.   Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher insist thatNATO's missiles, which they want to make more powerful, are vitalto the defense of the alliance. West Germany and its supporterscontend a series of moves by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachevto reduce nuclear and non-nuclear weapons reduce the missiles'significance.   The dispute has symbolic as well as strategic facets. Itreflects, on the one hand, a a determination by the Bushadministration to stick to its position, and on the other theemergence of West Germany from post-World War II acquiescence tothe United States in NATO affairs.   ``It should not be resolved at all costs,'' Baker said whilepredicting the missile issue would not dominate the summit nextMonday and Tuesday in Brussels.   Until the dispute boiled over, Bush and the White House staffwere planning on a calm presidential visit to friendly countrieswhere he could step serenely through a series of picture-takingevents. He will visit West Germany and Britain as well as Italy andBelgium.   That schedule remains intact, though the missile disputeprobably will require some clever draftmanship to paper over thedifferences in a windup NATO communique that stresses Westernsolidarity.   In Italy, besides talking with Italian government leaders, Bushwill meet with Pope John Paul II on Saturday in Rome and attendRoman Catholic mass and a Memorial Day ceremony in an Americancemetery in Nettuno, on the seacost 39 miles south of the capital,on Sunday. Bush is an Episcopalian.   After te two-day NATO meeting in Brussels, the president willcontinue his discussions with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl inBonn on Wednesday over dinner in a ballroom where Mozart's ``MagicFlute'' opera premiered in 1793 and on a riverboat cruise on theRhine.   In London on Thursday Bush will have the comfort of winding uphis travels meeting with his strongest supporter in the alliance,Mrs. Thatcher, at 10 Downing Street, and lunch with Queen ElizabethII at Buckingham Palace.   Then, on Friday, Bush flies to Maine for a weekend off.</TEXT></DOC>
