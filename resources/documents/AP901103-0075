Arab reports put the number of injured in the Gaza Stripviolence at 120, which would make it one of the highest dailyfigures during the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising.   The clashes underscored a rise in Arab-Israeli tensions sincethe Oct. 8 Temple Mount killings of 20 Arabs and subsequentstabbing deaths of three Israelis in Jerusalem.   The unrest began after soldiers informed the family of AttiyahAbdel Atti Zanin, 36, in the Gaza village of Beit Hanoun that hehad hanged himself in prison.   Zanin was detained 13 days ago for questioning about activism inthe Palestine Liberation Organization, Israeli and Arab reportssaid.   His body was found in Gaza City prison Friday night, danglingfrom a rope made of blankets, Prison Services spokeswoman ShulamitMeiri said.   She said the authorities believed the death was a suicide sincehe was alone in a cell and there were no other signs of violence onthe body. But Zanin's family demanded an autopsy to determine thecause of death.   Rumors also spread quickly through the village of 11,000 thatZanin had been killed by soldiers, spurring youths to take to thestreets where they stoned Israeli troops, Arab reports said.   Troops opened fire, killing Mohammed Izzat Abdullah elBassiouny, 36, of a bullet wound to the head, the reports added.The army said Bassiouny was 29.   He was the 771st Palestinian to be killed by Israelis in theuprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which are home to 1.7million Palestinians and some 70,000 Jewish settlers.   Another 293 Arabs have been killed by fellow Palestinians asalleged collaborators with Israel, and 55 Israelis and foreignershave been killed.   Riots spread from Beit Hanoun to six neighborhoods and refugeecamps in the vicinity of nearby Gaza City, the reports added.Witnesses said soldiers sprayed tear gas out of helicopters andused gravel-throwing machines in some spots to contain theviolence.   The army said 89Palestinians were injured in Gaza, most of themmoderately or slightly injured. The military said the shooting wasin response to ``numerous riots,'' in Gaza.   Four villages and refugee camps in Gaza were placed undercurfew.   Arab reports said 102 Palestinians were wounded in theseclashes. Of these, 49 were struck by live ammunition and 48 byrubber-coated metal bullets, the Arab reports said, citing hospitalofficials.   Another four Palestinians suffered beating injuries. A4-year-old boy, Zoheir Abu El Nur, of Jebalya, was reported injuredseriously in the head by stones from an army gravel-throwingmachine. He was rushed unconscious to Tel Hashomer Hospital nearTel Aviv, Arab reports said.   Violence also broke out later Saturday in Rafah in Gaza'ssouthern reaches. Assailants threw a firebomb at an Israelimilitary patrol and troops opened fire wounding 17 Palestinians,Arab reports said.</TEXT></DOC>
