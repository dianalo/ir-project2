The civilian attackers stormed the base carried pamphletssupporting officers who have led three previous uprisings, theprivate news agency Diario y Noticias said.   Soldiers firing tank shells, mortars and heavy machine gunsregained control of most of the base a few hours later but held offon a final assault because of concerns some hostages were being heldinside, the state-run Telam news agency said, quoting unidentifiedmilitary sources.   Soldiers and Buenos Aires provincial police backed by tanksreportedly surrounded several buildings where the civilian fighterswere holed up.   Under a hazy summer sun, two small tanks opened the nooncounterattack, firing on the officers' club in which the civilianswere thought to be isolated, Telam said. Sporadic shooting continuedseveral hours.   Provincial government and police sources said four soldiers werekilled and eight soldiers or police wounded. At least two civilianfighters were killed, DyN reported.   Earlier news reports said three civilians and two police werekilled. It was not clear if the later reports included thesecasualties.   The Ministry of Defense, anticipating a possible fourthinsurrection against the government in the past 21 months, bolstereddefenses at Government House and the official residence of PresidentRaul Alfonsin, Telam said.   The civilian president spoke by telephone with Defense MinisterHoracio Jaunarena and Army Chief Gen. Francisco Gassino and toldthem to retake the base, presidential press secretary Jose IgnacioLopez told reporters.   Buenos Aires provincial police surrounded it, began to evacuatenearby residents, and took up firing positions in private homes.   The incident comes less than two months after a short-livedbarracks insurrection to protest Alfonsin's treatment of themilitary.   The seizure occurred at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at La Tablada,12 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.   Defense Ministry officials made no comment and the precise numberof civilians involved or soldiers at the base was not known.   The attack began about 3 a.m., when civilians threw several smallexplosive devices onto the base compound, DyN reported.   Employees at a nearby gas station said that at about 6:15 a.m.,civilians in a truck crashed through the regiment's main gate, DyNsaid. Six cars followed.   A total of 40 to 50 men and women dressed in civilian clotheswere in the truck and cars, news agencies reported. Police put thenumber at about 30.   According to DyN, as they entered the base, the civilians threwpamphlets supporting what is known as the ``New Argentine Army'' ofLt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led short-lived army uprisings in April 1987and January 1988. Rico was dismissed and now is in prison.   Other pamphlets read ``Long Live Rico!'' and ``Long LiveSeineldin!'' DyN reported. Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin led a four-dayuprising in December. He also is in prison.   The base was almost empty at the time of the attack, the newsagencies reported. They said most officers and non-commissioned menhad left for the weekend and had not returned.   The December insurrection began after officers at several armybases, including La Tablada, tried to incite troops. Seineldinsurrendered four days later.   The only clashes reported during that insurrection were betweentroops and civilians, many of whom harbor animosity toward themilitary.   On Friday, President Alfonsin told a news conference thatfactions within the army still are angry over issues such as theprosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the1976-83 military dictatorship, which he was elected in 1983 toreplace.   ``I affirm categorically that those factions are not going tohave the possibilities to triumph,'' Alfonsin said. ``But I shouldsay with absolute seriousness that I am not in the position ofassuring with the same force and certainty that there will not beother episodes.''</TEXT></DOC>
