(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nearly five centuries after ChristopherColumbus set sail, scientists still debate whether Europeanexplorers unleashed the scourge of syphilis on the Americas. Astudy says it might have been the other way around.   Research by two University of Massachusetts anthropologistscites studies of skeletal remains that they say show forms ofsyphilis existed in the New World before Columbus and his crewlanded.   In contrast, the researchers said studies from the pre-1492 OldWorld show almost no evidence of syphilis.   Doctoral candidate Brenda J. Baker and Professor George J.Armelagos base part of their conclusions on an apparent epidemic ofsyphilis in Europe in the 1500s.   Their research was presented in an article, ``The Origin andAntiquity of Syphilis,'' which appeared in a recent issue ofCurrent Anthropology.   An opposing theory holds that venereal syphilis was present inEurope before it was transported by the explorers to America, butat the time the disease was not distinguished from leprosy.   Another theory suggests the disease has occurred independentlyin both continents.   The Massachusetts researchers cite one case of a skull showingsigns of syphilis from a London cemetery. But they note thecemetery was used between 1197 and 1537, and it is impossible todate the bone exactly.   Another case from Norway could be pre-Columbian, the researchersnote, raising the possibility that Norse explorers brought thedisease back to their country. Explorers led by Leif Ericson areacknowledged to have landed in Greenland a little more than 500years before Columbus crossed the Atlantic.   Syphilis is detected by such marks as lesions on bones and markson skulls, Baker said. It is usually transmitted sexually and, ifuntreated, it can lead to the degeneration of bones, heart andnerve tissue.   Several skeletons marked by syphilis have been excavated inAustralia but the dating is uncertain, the study said. A handful ofpossibly pre-Columbian syphilitic bones have been found insoutheast Asia, but that is compared to hundreds of discoveries inthe Americas, Baker said.   Whether a European epidemic of syphilis occurred after thesailors' return isn't entirely clear. Baker and Armelagos concludeit did after reviewing documents, studies of bones and numerousordinances passed throughout Europe in the late 1490s concerningthe disease. Opposing theorists say the outbreak merely reflectedthe recognition that syphilis was distinct from leprosy.   The various explanations of the origin of syphilis havefascinated scientists for two reasons _ sex and politics, says AlB. Wesolowsky, managing editor of the Journal of Field Archeologyat Boston University.   ``First, syphilis is a venereal disease and so anythingconnected with sex often has an interest in and of its own,'' hesaid. The question also has political implications in light of agrowing awareness that Native Americans see 1492 as an invasionthat led to their exploitation and devastation by imported diseasessuch as smallpox and tuberculosis, he said.   Gary Kimble, executive director of the New York-basedAssociation on American Indian Affairs, said the disease could havebeen circulated from the Middle East to Europe and from there tothe Americas.   But he professed little interest in the debate, and said hisagency is working on the more pressing issue of halting excavationand public display of Native Americans' bones.   Kimble said a bigger issue than the origin of syphilis is theway Columbus' travels have been characterized.   ``The conclusions of the Incan and pre-Incan civilizations,their importance and their sophistication has really beenminimized,'' he said. The Incas dominated in Peru until the Spanishconquest.   Kimble said there were an estimated 30 million Indians in theNorthern Hemisphere in 1492, and just 400,000 in 1900.   ``That's the story of Columbus,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
