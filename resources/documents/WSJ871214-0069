RicksStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDASTOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN><TEXT>   The U.S. and Canada are close to signing an agreement that would increase significantly the exchange of information between the two nations on insider trading and other securities-law violations, Canadian securities officials said.    The memorandum of understanding, which should be approved within the next month, goes well beyond the agreements the U.S. already has with other nations on securities investigations, said Ermanno Pascutto, director of the Ontario Securities Commission.    Under the expected agreement, Mr. Pascutto said, the U.S. and Canada will begin &quot;providing assistance even when it isn't asked for -- like calling up someone and saying, 'This person is moving into your jurisdiction.'&quot;    Officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on the expected accord.    It isn't clear, however, whether the agreement would allow the SEC to obtain information from an offshore Canadian bank in the Cayman Islands or in the Bahamas, for example. Antoni Dandonneau, chief legal counsel of the Quebec Securities Commission, said, &quot;Maybe it's possible. We'll see.&quot;    But Harvey Pitt, a U.S. lawyer who represented the Bahamas office of a Swiss bank in the Dennis Levine insider-trading case, said he doubted the U.S. reach would extend to offshore Canadian banks.    Nor is it clear how the pact would affect pending insider-trading investigations in the U.S. and in Canada. The Ontario Securities Commission said last summer that it is pursuing a major investigation of possible insider-trading activity. Asked about that inquiry, Mr. Pascutto declined to elaborate, except to say that the agreement &quot;will improve our ability to deal with international securities activity.&quot;    Canada has no nationwide securities regulatory body, but rather a commission in each province. The Ontario and Quebec commissions oversee about 90% of Canadian trading activity, Mr. Pascutto said. In Canada, he added, &quot;Relatively speaking, I think we have more foreign trading than anyone else.&quot;    Mr. Dandonneau, the Quebec legal officer, said the expected agreement contains an unusual provision under which the SEC promises to seek to have U.S. law amended to enable it to use subpoena powers to obtain evidence concerning violations of foreign securities laws. The SEC currently is allowed to investigate only violations of U.S. laws. </TEXT></DOC>
