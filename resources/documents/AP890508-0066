Albert GoreJr. said today.   Gore, D-Tenn., said at the outset of a hearing by a sciencesubcommittee he chairs that the administration sought to minimizethe seriousness of the problems found by Dr. James E. Hansen,director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.   Gore said Sunday that the Office of Management and Budget``censored'' the testimony on the so-called greenhouse effect.   The senator added today, ``Scientists, like Dr. Hansen, tell usthat global temperatures could increase two to five degreescentigrade in our lifetimes because of the billions and billions oftons of carbon dioxide we pump into the air every year and becauseemissions of other greenhouses gases ....''   The senator said, ``There are a few environmentalists in thisadministration, such as William Reilly at EPA (the EnvironmentalProtection Agency), who is first rate. But they are outnumbered bythe James Watt clones put in key posts throughout theadministration. The environmentalists are being overruled, andworse, they're sometimes being muzzled.''   As former President Reagan's interior secretary, Watt pursuedpolicies that were vehemently opposed by environmental groups.   Gore said Hansen, ``one of our government's foremostscientists,'' was censored ``not on questions of policy, but on hisscientific opinions concerning detailed, painstaking research.''   The New York Times today quoted Hansen as saying OMB edited thetext of his testimony for today's hearing to soften the conclusionsand make the prospects of change in climate appear more uncertain.   ``It distresses me that they put words in my mouth; they evenput it in the first person,'' Hansen told the Times, adding that hehad tried to ``negotiate'' with the budget office over the wordingbut ``they refused to change.''   ``I should be allowed to say what is my scientific position;there is no rationale by which OMB should be censoring scientificopinion,'' Hansen said. ``I can understand changing policy, but notscience.''   The Times said Hansen's original testimony was that computerprojections of changes in climate caused by carbon dioxide andother gases released into the atmosphere show substantial increasesin temperature, drought, severe storms and other stresses likely toaffect the Earth's biological systems.   Hansen's original testimony would have supported the positionthat, while there are still many uncertainties, enough is known nowabout the general and even regional effects of the global warmingtrend to start acting now to mitigate and prepare for thoseeffects, the paper said.   Hansen was not reachable for comment Sunday night.   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said he had no knowledge ofthe matter.   Officials ordered the scientist to change his testimony becauseit would ``conflict with the ideologically based do-nothingapproach which they're most comfortable with,'' said Gore.   Gore said he was told by sources in the Bush administration thatofficials had ``censored the scientific opinions we have asked tobe presented.''   ``I think they're scared of the truth. I think they're scaredthat Hansen and the other scientists are right and that somedramatic policy changes are going to be needed and they don't wantto face up to it because they prefer to do nothing.''   Gore said he knew of no similar orders being given to otherscientists scheduled to testify. He said his committee would askOMB officials to explain why the testimony was changed.</TEXT></DOC>
