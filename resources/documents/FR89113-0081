It is stated that National Fuel currently provides Cook with sales serviceunder National Fuel's general service Rate Schedule RQ, pursuant to anopen requirements service agreement dated November 1, 1977. It is allegedthat under the terms of the service agreement, National Fuel is obligatedto sell and deliver, on a firm basis, and Cook is obligated to receiveand pay for a minimum monthly demand of 123 dekatherm and a minimum monthlywinter requirement quantity of 9,077 dekatherm. It is asserted that Cook has tendered partial payment for one monthly invoiceand has not made any payment whatsoever in connection with another 35 monthlyinvoices over a period beginning April of 1985. Cumulative past due amountsfor gas sales made prior to National Fuel's 1987 fiscal year total $37,929,28.Cook also owes an additional $33,583.21 and $59,506.63, respectively, forgas sold and delivered to Cook by National Fuel during fiscal years 1987and 1988. It is alleged that as of December 9, 1988, Cook's past due obligationstotal approximately $161,169.16. National Fuel states that it has made numerous efforts to resolve Cook'spayment deficiencies and to bring the payment account current, but to noavail. It is further stated that on August 1, 1986, Cook executed a promissorynote in favor of National Fuel in the amount of $86,506.11 representingamounts then past due and agreed to a payment schedule. After Cook failedto maintain the agreed upon payment schedule, National Fuel received ajudgement in Pennsylvania State Court for the amount of the promissorynote, plus interest. It is claimed that such judgement has not yet beensatisfied, and may never be satisfied due to the relative state of Cook'sassets. It is alleged that there appears no reasonable likelihood that Cook wouldrender timely and complete payment to National Fuel for National Fuel'scurrent and future sales and deliveries of gas to Cook. Under these circumstances,National Fuel proposes to permanently abandon its sales to Cook, to terminateits service obligation under the Commission's certificate authorization,and to abandon in place a related sales tap and meter.  National Fuel asserts that Cook's system appears to be physically interconnectedwith the system of North Penn Gas Company and with local production fromseveral wells. Cook in its 1986 annual report to the Pennsylvania PublicUtilities Commission identified 40 percent of its gas purchases from NationalFuel and 60 percent as from a combination of other sources. Cook's othersupply sources as identified in its 1986 annual report are: North PennGas Company, Halls Well Service, and Cook Oil andamp; Gas Production. Nationalbelieves that Cook's payment accounts with its other gas suppliers arecurrent. National Fuel claims that upon the Commission's approval of theabandonment request, Cook should be able to maintain adequate service toits customers through its purchases of natural gas under current arrangementswith one or more of its other suppliers. <T3>Comment date: </T3>January 30, 1989, in accordance with the first subparagraphof Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">4.
