Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder.    &quot;We said we'd do something dramatic and we've done it,&quot; James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive officer, said in an interview Friday. Besides resuming dividend payments, Texaco also will consider a major stock repurchase program and will shed $5 billion in assets, up from the $3 billion originally contemplated as part of its restructuring program.    Texaco suspended its $3-a-share annual dividend when it entered bankruptcy-law proceedings last year. Earlier this month, the company emerged from Chapter 11 protection after agreeing to pay Pennzoil Co. $3 billion to settle their titanic, four year-old legal dispute.    &quot;What's so dramatic?&quot; countered an irate Mr. Icahn in a separate interview over the weekend. Texaco, he said, &quot;is selling $5 billion of its assets, but it's giving $3 billion away to Pennzoil and the company says maybe it will buy back some shares. but you can't take maybes to the bank.&quot;    Mr. Icahn said he would press ahead with his plans to run his own slate of nominees for the five board seats up for election at Texaco's annual meeting on June 7. And he said he already is rehearsing the questions he intends to pose to Texaco shareholders.    &quot;If Texaco was your family-owned company, would you continue to let those guys at the top keep calling the shots in light of their past record -- even if they had married your daughters?&quot; Mr. Icahn said he would ask shareholders. &quot;I know I sure as hell wouldn't.&quot;    Mr. Icahn, however, appears the clear underdog in the battle for the board seats. Many investors -- who plan to vote their shares for management's slate -- said his goals are vague and his nominees weak.    Reflecting investor enthusiasm for the company's latest moves, Texaco shares climbed $1.75 to close at $48.625 a share in heavy composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.    &quot;Texaco dramatically increased its odds of being successful in a proxy fight against (Mr.) Icahn by reinstating its dividend,&quot; said William Brown III, an oil analyst for Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. He added, however, that holders were disappointed by Texaco's announcement that it was only considering a stock buy-back.    Mr. Icahn, who holds a 14.8% stake in the oil company, insisted that he has formulated some definite ideas about how Texaco should be restructured. Among other things, he wants the company to sell its stake in Texaco Canada and Caltex -- a major overseas joint venture owned with Chevron Corp. -- and to make the proceeds available to shareholders.    Mr. Kinnear said that he would &quot;actively consider&quot; repurchasing Texaco's stock if it &quot;makes good sound economic sense.&quot; But first he said he will focus on selling assets and reducing and refinancing high-interest debt. As part of its refinancing program, Mr. Kinnear said, Texaco expects to re-enter the commercial paper market, which it was forced to abandon more than two years ago after Pennzoil obtained an $11 billion court judgment against Texaco in a dispute over the ownership of Getty Oil Co.    Texaco's board, at its first meeting since the White Plains, N.Y.-based company emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings April 7, voted Friday to reinstate the 75 cent-a-share quarterly dividend, making it payable June 10 to stock of record May 3.    As expected, the board also approved management's proposal -- only definitively clarified late Thursday -- to expand the pending assets-sale program. Mr. Kinnear wouldn't say what the company expects to sell in addition to its previously announced plan to sell Deutsche Texaco AG and interests in its U.S. and European manufacturing and marketing assets as well as certain oil reserves.    Mr. Kinnear did say, however, that the first bids on the 60 million barrels of U.S. oil and gas reserves that Texaco expects to sell will be received by early next week. At least 200 of the 300 parties that received solicitation letters are expected to respond, Mr. Kinnear said.    Texaco also said Friday it would pursue a rigorous program to streamline management. Mr. Kinnear said he wasn't considering &quot;massive layoffs,&quot; but expects rather to reduce Texaco's work force of 51,000 through attrition and the sale of operating units.    Separately, Texaco said director Elvis Mason, a prominent former Texas banker, resigned from the board Friday. Mr. Kinnear, who said he didn't expect any further board resignations in the near future, said Mr. Mason was leaving because his merchant banking business was expanding.    &quot;There were 23 board meetings last year,&quot; Mr. Kinnear said. &quot;It was a strain.&quot;    Mr. Mason was succeeded by L. Stanton Williams, former chairman of PPG Industries Inc., a Pittsburgh-based maker of chemicals and other products. There are 14 seats on Texaco's board. </TEXT></DOC>
