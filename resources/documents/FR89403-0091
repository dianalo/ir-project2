The NRC staff has preparedan Environmental Assessment of the Proposed Action, ``Environmental Assessmentby the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Relating to the Expansion ofthe Spent Fuel Pool,'' Facility Operating License No. NPF-18, CommonwealthEdison Company, LaSalle County Station, Unit 2, Docket No. 50-374, datedMarch 28, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Environmental Assessment</ITAG>The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handlingand Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel'' (NUREG-0575), Volumes1-3, concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage of spentfuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflects theadvantage of continued generation of nuclear power with the accompanyingspent fuel storage. Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommendedevaluating spent fuel pool expansions on a case-by-case basis.For the LaSalle County Station, Unit 2, the expansion of the storage capacityof the spent fuel pool will not create any significant additional radiologicaleffects or non-radiological environmental impacts.The estimated additional whole body dose that might be received by an individualat the site boundary is less than 0.1 mrem/year; the estimated dose tothe population within an 80 kilometer radius is expected to be less than0.1 person-rem/year. These doses are small compared to the fluctuationsin the annual dose this population receives from exposure to backgroundradiation. The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation ofthe expanded spent fuel pool is estimated to be less than two percent ofthe total annual occupational radiation exposure for this facility.The only non-radiological impact affected by the SFP expansion is the wasteheat rejected. The increase in total plant waste heat is estimated to beless than 0.01 percent. There is no significant environmental impact attributedto the waste heat from the plant due to this very small increase.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facilityrelative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR Part 51. Based on thisassessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiologicalor non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action and thatthe issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have no significantimpact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to10 CFR 51.31, no environmental impact statement needs to be prepared forthis action.For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applicationfor amendment to the Technical Specifications dated September 19, 1986as supplemented on August 18, 1987; and additional information providedby the licensee in letters dated November 5, 24, 1987 and May 17, 1988,(2) the FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power ReactorFuel (NUREG-0575), (3) the Final Environmental Statement for LaSalle CountyStation, Units 1 and 2, dated November, 1978, and (4) the EnvironmentalAssessment dated __.These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at thePublic Library of Illinois Valley Community College, Rural Route No. 1,Oglesby, Illinois 61348.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 28th day of March 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Daniel R.
