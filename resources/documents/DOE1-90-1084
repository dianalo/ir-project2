As in this lens focusing is conducted by cross-sectionradial field, it is stronger than axisymmetric lenses. Regarding endeffects the expressions for trajectories in coaxial lens are estimatedwith account of energy variation on the field input and output. Regimes,when particles deviating to axis are focused in a ring are found.</TEXT></DOC>
