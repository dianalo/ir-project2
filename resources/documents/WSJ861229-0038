The precaution is at the order of FBI Director William Webster. The 62-year-old Mr. Webster is determined to prevent the current scandal from sullying the independent, nonpartisan image he has worked so hard to build for the FBI since 1978, when he took over an agency still demoralized by Watergate.    But now, questions about the FBI's role in the Reagan administration's current foreign-policy crisis threaten to damage those hard-earned gains. The bureau is on the defensive for delaying a criminal investigation of Southern Air Transport, a Miami-based cargo airline suspected of shipping arms both to Iran and to Nicaraguan rebels. Mr. Webster suspended the probe for nearly a month at the request of Attorney General Edwin Meese, who said it might hamper efforts to recover U.S. hostages held in the Middle East.    Incoming Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, contends that the FBI and Mr. Meese should be investigated for &quot;allegations of possible improper or unethical activities&quot; in connection with the delay of the Southern Air probe.    Meanwhile, the Justice Department's own ethics watchdog, the Office of Professional Responsibility, already has begun investigating the incident. And Lawrence Walsh, the independent prosecutor responsible for unraveling the entire Iran-Contra affair, also is expected to look into the issue.    Lawmakers, who are demanding FBI documents, say the agency's role in the overall flap still isn't clear. For FBI officials, this turn of events carries echoes of the worst memories of the past. So they have quietly launched a counteroffensive to protect the bureau's integrity.    The FBI, for example, weeks ago began an internal probe of the Southern Air incident, and bureau officials have been ordered to prepare memos detailing their part in the episode. A senior FBI manager acknowledges that &quot;in this instance, everything, and I mean everything, is being done by the book.&quot; FBI officials &quot;clearly are very careful about additional contacts&quot; with Attorney General Meese or other Justice Department appointees, this official says, &quot;and we're mindful of potential criticism.&quot;    Mr. Webster also has instructed FBI agents and supervisors to pursue leads and collect evidence independent of any formal requests or authority from senior Justice Department officials. Details of what the FBI uncovers aren't shared with the attorney general or with White House aides, law-enforcement officials say. And FBI officials are under orders to carefully document the limited contacts they do have with superiors at Justice Department headquarters, which is across Pennsylvania Avenue from the fortresslike FBI building.    Moreover, officials say a number of senior FBI and Justice Department managers, including officials who routinely deal with the press, are purposely being kept out of the briefings and the flow of information to minimize the possibility of leaks.    As part of this overall strategy, Oliver &quot;Buck&quot; Revell, one of the FBI's executive assistant directors and a confidant of Mr. Webster, was taken off the Iran-Contra investigation weeks ago. Mr. Revell previously served with fired White House aide Oliver North on two of the administration's high-level anti-terrorism committees, and Lt. Col. North reportedly asked him in October to sidetrack the Southern Air probe.    For their part, senior Justice Department officials seem resigned to letting the FBI call the shots. Stephen Trott, an associate attorney general, has said that department lawyers primarily are &quot;performing a caretaker function&quot; in the investigation; they are making sure that foreign bank accounts are frozen, documents are safeguarded and other evidence is assembled for the independent counsel.    Mr. Webster and the FBI still retain respect in Congress, and his decisive actions are likely to reassure many lawmakers. But critics say the bureau's precautions on the Iran-Contra investigation are coming too late. Regardless of the steps FBI officials take, there is widespread agreement that they won't be able to dissipate quickly the intense legal and political controversy that is swirling around the bureau, and that threatens to drag it further into the scandal.    Mr. Webster, who postponed his retirement plans by at least several months to help steer the bureau through the current investigation, declines to give interviews on the subject. But he recently told reporters in a breakfast meeting that, to safeguard the FBI, it is essential to &quot;ferret out apparent conflicts (of interest) and other things that might affect the integrity&quot; of the investigation. &quot;It's also our job, I think, to anticipate those things, and to deal with them as best we can,&quot; he said.    When he was asked to compare the current situation to the FBI's travails in Watergate, when there were disclosures of agency complicity in the Nixon administration cover-up, Mr. Webster was reluctant to draw comparisons.    &quot;It's too early for me to start drawing judgments about what got people into trouble&quot; this time, Mr. Webster said. &quot;But certainly,&quot; he asserted, &quot;I think there is an obvious difference&quot; in the way President Reagan has responded to the crisis.    According to the FBI chief, the public was advised &quot;almost as soon as the president found out that there was a problem&quot; involving the diversion of profits from arms sales to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contras. And for the FBI, he said, &quot;There is a real expectation that we will fully develop the facts.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
