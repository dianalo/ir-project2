McCarthy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GLD </CO><IN> TNM IND BBK </IN><TEXT>   Gould Inc. said it agreed to sell its industrial automation division for $290 million to AEG of West Germany as part of a major restructuring.    Gould, based in Rolling Meadows, Ill., also said that it plans to buy back as much as 20% of its common stock, which would cost $103 million at yesterday's $11.375-a-share closing price in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Gould's departure from industrial automation -- the factory of the future industry it pioneered with the invention of the programmable controller -- will leave the company significantly smaller. Industrial automation, which wasn't profitable last year, accounted for about 20% of Gould's 1987 revenue of $933.4 million.    The sale will allow Gould to focus on its computer and electronics businesses. It is the second major sale announced by James F. McDonald, Gould's chairman and chief executive officer. Soon after he assumed control in early 1986, Mr. McDonald announced plans to sell the defense division; some of that division has yet to be sold.    Gould's industrial automation business has been marked by a management turnover, slipping market share and several quarters of poor results. Gould had recently tried to improve the division's performance by laying off several hundred employees and cutting other costs.    Gould wasn't the only company to have trouble with the business. Other large industrial companies have found the only way to survive in the market is to link up in a joint venture.    In the past few years, Rockwell International Corp. acquired Allen-Bradley Co., and joint ventures have been set up between Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Siemens AG of West Germany, and General Electric Co. and Fanuc Ltd. of Japan.    A spokesman said Gould was looking into such alliances when it received inquiries about selling the division. &quot;Because it was marketable, we decided to sell it,&quot; the spokesman added.    AEG, based in Frankfurt, West Germany, is an electrical and electronics company.    Proceeds from the sale will be used to cut Gould's debt and to finance the stock buy-back. Gould shares are trading at about half their 52-week high. With 45.2 million shares outstanding, the company could buy as many as about nine million shares.    Because of sizable write-offs Gould has taken in recent years, the company's lenders have prohibited the company from paying cash dividends and buying its common stock. Gould said it will need lenders' approval to proceed with the buy-back. </TEXT></DOC>
