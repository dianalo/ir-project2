 &quot;It's designed to servethe masses and does a great job.andP;  Our customers are those few companies thatneed a little bit more,&quot; says Robert Atkinson of the Teleport CommunicationsGroup.andM;The Teleport Communications Group is one of a number of alternative localaccess providers who supply their customers with a fiber optic or microwavelink -- separate from the link the Bell Operating Company provides -- totheir long distance company's point-of-presence (POP), or a private-lineconnection to another location.andM;They generally provide DS-1 to DS-3 service (sometimes DS-0) and take care ofthe maintenance of the link.andP;  Most provide 24 hour a day, seven day a weekmonitoring.andP;  Users report that the provider knows about trouble with theservice before they do.andM;Teleport Communications New York has a network that consists of 180 miles offiber optic cable in New York City and northern New Jersey.andP;  The networkallows companies to access the Teleport, a complex of domestic andinternational long distance satellite links in addition to other benefits.andM;In Chicago, Metropolitan Fiber Systems runs their fiber optic network throughan unused freight train tunnel 40-feet under the city.andP;  It's protected by afoot-thick concrete wall.andM;Alternative access is used for a number of things.andP;  Disaster avoidance is oneapplication that companies are becoming more aware of.andP;  The Hinsdale firemade companies that depend on their phone systems painfully aware of thedanger of leaving that last mile -- the local loop -- unprotected.andM;&quot;Hinsdale had a galvanizing effect on our users.andP;  It either affected them orsomeone they knew,&quot; says Atkinson.andM;Using an alternative local access service provides disaster protection in twoways.andP;  First, alternative local access services go out of their way toprovide routing that is different from the route traveled by the BOC.andP;  Byusing an alternative access line in addition to the BOC local loop, routediversity is automatically provided.andM;&quot;An alternate carrier is only as good as its diversity from the othercarrier,&quot; notes Saul Adler of Bankers Trust, an alternate access user.andP;  Hecautions users that they shouldn't use the same site entrance for theiralternate carrier as they use for their first carrier to preserve thatdiversity.andM;Second, alternative access providers know that reliability is very importantto their customers.andP;  Most provide complete end-to-end redundancy on theirnetworks.andM;&quot;We've had cable cuts,&quot; reports Atkinson, &quot;but our customers never knew it.&quot;andO;Everything in Teleport's network is fully redundant.andM;Companies also use alternate local access services to access long distancepoints-of-premise and as a short-haul private line between buildings in acity.andP;  Interexchange carriers use them to access hubs and other carriers.andM;A company could use the services of their local BOC for any of theseapplications.andP;  Why do companies turn to alternative access?andM;There are four major reasons, says George Tronsrue of Metropolitan FiberSystems.andP;  &quot;One, our networks are built with full redundancy.andP;  Two, thequality that digital fiber optics provide.andP;  Three, cost.andP;  And four, ourresponsive service.andP;  We provide flexibility and responsiveness in all ourcustomer service activities.&quot;andM;The quality that Tronsrue refers to is evident in the availability rates (theamount of time their networks are available for use) reported by alternativelocal access providers, both fiber optic- and microwave-based.andP;  MetropolitanFiber System promises 99.925% availability, Locate has 99.98% and TeleportCommunications New York reports 99.99% availability in the New York area.andM;Alternative access providers do not try to market their services based onprice, but many users find their prices attractive.andM;When Metropolitan Fiber Services enters a market they target their prices at15% to 20% below Bell rates, says George Tronsrue.andP;  Because of increasedcompetition from the BOCs, in some markets they start out with a price thatis equal to what the local BOC is offering.andM;Atkinson says Teleport's prices sometimes cost a little less than the BOC,and sometimes they cost a little more, but says they don't compete on thebasis of price.andM;He points out that even if both Teleport and the local BOC charge the samefor the T-1, you are getting full redundancy from Teleport.andP;  You would haveto get another T-1 for the same kind of protection from the BOC.andP;  &quot;It is sortof like getting it for half price -- but that's the wrong way to look at it,&quot;he says.andM;The main reason the alternative local access providers are so wary aboutbasing any comparison on price is they don't expect to hold their priceadvantage for much longer.andP;  The BOCs are responding quickly to thealternative access challenge.andP;  At the moment they are responding by loweringtheir prices.andP;  In the future the advantages the alternative access providerswill still have, they say, is reliability and service.andM;The people who use alternative access services all praise the high quality ofthe service provided.andP;  Metropolitan Fiber Systems will hook you up with theirservice in seven to 21 days.andP;  How do they do it?andM;Robert Atkinson says Teleport is able to provide superior service becausethey concentrate on one thing, fiber, and they do it well.andM;&quot;We have one kind of equipment and one kind of technology in our network.andO;It's built for a specific purpose and we spend our time on specific users.&quot;andM;Tronsrue says Metropolitan Fiber Systems succeeds in service from a number ofangles.andP;  They know their business depends on being better than thecompetition, and this includes service.andP;  He says the fact that they spent alot of money designing and implementing their network pays off in betterreliability, which in turn means they can give the few problems that do occura lot of attention.andM;He cites Metropolitan Fiber Services hiring and detailed training program asanother reason.andP;  &quot;Come through the operations center, talk to the techniciansand see how much they know.andP;  It's very revealing.&quot;andM;Microwave-based alternative access services can set up anywhere, but fibersystems need to have a network installed.andP;  While you are most likely to findthese alternative fiber optic networks in cities that have a largeconcentration of the financial services companies that are among their bestcustomers, you may be surprised how many cities have alternative fibernetworks or will soon.andM;ATkinson, who also serves as the president of the Association for LocalTelecommunications Services (ALT), the alternative local carriers tradeassociation, says there are ALT members in Milwaukee, Chicago, San Francisco,Orlando, Tampa, Washington DC, Indianapolis and Philadelphia, to name just afew.andP;  And he knows of nonmeber companies in Tulsa and Dallas.andP;  The TeleportCommunications Group has made public plans to expand to five cities includingLos Angeles and Houston.andM;Alternative local access providers may serve only a small percentage of allusers, but that percentage includes the largest and most sophisticatedcompanies.andP;  The percentages are in their favor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
