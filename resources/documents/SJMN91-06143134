The Latin phrases that appear on &quot;scripts,&quot; asprescriptions are known to pharmacists, are likely to be abbreviated. Andoften they're not so much written as scrawled.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'IF YOU FILL IT WRONG, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE'PHARMACISTS MAKE SENSE OF DOCTORS' ILLEGIBLELATIN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Health andamp; Fitness  </MEMO><TEXT>     Even so, when you hand the prescription to the pharmacist, he or sheusually reads it quickly, as if it were in plain English, printed in blockletters. Amazing? Druggists say no.;    &quot;You could read prescriptions as wellas the next guy,&quot; says Dale Foster of Wendt Drug Co. in Elmhurst, Ill., &quot;butyou would have to be trained in what to look for.&quot;;    Foster and otherdruggists willingly parted with some of the cryptographic tricks of theirtrade:;    (check) The Latin abbreviations, which usually describe dosages,not medications, are standard. For example, &quot;QID&quot; means &quot;four times daily.&quot;BID means two times daily and TID means three times daily. At some point, QODentered the code, which at first baffled druggists. Now everyone knows what itmeans: &quot;Every other day.&quot;;    &quot;They also use 'PC' and 'HS,' &quot; says TonyNigliazzo of Tanke Pharmacy on the Near North Side of Chicago. &quot; 'PC' meansafter meals and 'HS' means at bedtime -- hour of sleep. A drop is GTT. So 1'GTT LE QID' could be a direction. It means one drop in the left ear 4 times aday.&quot;;    (check) Pharmacists are familiar with all or nearly all medicationson the market. When, rarely, the introduction of a new drug has escaped theirnotice, they may find it, too, on a computer data base or in the new pharmacyjournal. They have been trained to recognize drugs by brand and generic name,by standard abbreviations for those names, and by chemical composition.;   (check) Pharmacists know most of the doctors who write the prescriptions theyfill and know the peculiarities of their handwriting.;    There is theoccasional exception. Says Jonie Androh, pharmacist at Saperstein Brothers onthe South Side: &quot;I've worked in drug stores since I was 13 years old andconsider myself pretty good, but there's one physician here whose handwritingI just can't figure out. It's just lines, with a bump here and a bump there.But one of our technicians knows exactly what he wants.&quot;;    Pharmacistsreadily admit that sometimes they, too, can be mystified by scripts. Which maybe one reason why God let Alexander Graham Bell invent the telephone.;    &quot;Ifyou can't read it and you don't call the doctor and check it, you're a fool --that's the way I feel about it,&quot; says Foster. &quot;If you read it wrong, and fillit wrong, you're responsible for what you did.&quot;;    But calls are seldomnecessary. &quot;Sometimes we have to call about the directions,&quot; Nigliazzo says.&quot;It's unusual, but it does happen.&quot;;    Just for the record, the initials &quot;RX&quot;that appear on prescriptions are a Latin abbreviation for &quot;recipe,&quot; whichlingers from the days when pharmacists, or apothecaries, compoundedprescriptions by mixing the ingredients themselves, a rare thing today, whenmany pharmacists don't even have to count the pills they dispense. A machinedoes it for them.;    Their training also prepares pharmacists to findmistakes in doctors' scripts. Ronald L. Foreman, toxicologist with the Bureauof Laboratories of Chicago Department of Health, with drug store experience inHispanic-American neighborhoods as well as in Oak Park and southern Wisconsin,recalled an error that was easy to spot but difficult to deal with. A doctorhad prescribed 500 milligrams a day of a medication for a drug that normallywould be taken in 50 or 100 milligram dosages.;    &quot;My guess was that thedoctor meant 100 milligrams, but I couldn't reach the doctor. So I had todecide whether to fill it or not. I decided not to. We got hold of the doctorthe next day, and it was 50 milligrams he wanted.&quot;;    Androh once had aprescription for vaginal suppositories, with directions to take one tablet bymouth twice a day. &quot;I called, and the doctor immediately corrected it to onetablet vaginally at bedtime.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CLARENCE PETERSEN, Chicago Tribune  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Chicago  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910522  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  742  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 22, 199100143134,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
