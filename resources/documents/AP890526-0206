MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the arcane world of East-West armsnegotiations, a public relations touch can be a powerful tool.President Bush will be trying to apply his own at the 40thanniversary NATO summit, opening in Brussels on Monday.   He has some catching up to do.   Built into administration complaints about public relationsploys in Soviet arms proposals is a tacit admission that Mikhail S.Gorbachev has been using that American technique to America'sdisadvantage.   Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, acknowledgedthe importance of appearance when the administration offered anupbeat appraisal of new Soviet proposals on conventional armslimits. ``The president felt he appeared too negative before, sohe's trying to appear more positive now,'' Scowcroft said.   This is the president's week to try to counter Gorbachev, tocast himself and the United States as the real peacemakers. He'sconferring with allied leaders in Rome, Brussels, Bonn and London.   But reclaiming the initiative will take more imaginativegestures than his revived ``open skies'' arms verification proposalor the ``open ledgers'' idea he offered on Wednesday.   With Gorbachev piling theoretical troops, tanks and missilesonto the negotiating table, Bush is left trying to explain a validconcern: that even if those proposals come true, the Soviet sidewill still have a hefty margin in weapons and troops. That is whatthe administration says must be balanced by NATO's battlefieldnuclear weapons.   The White House insists that Gorbachev is the one doing theresponding, that his arms reduction offers are in answers toproposals first made by the West.   The president's men are trying to cast Bush as the visionaryleader, the man whose themes and concepts will endure to reshapethe world balance long after the Soviet Union's itemized proposalshave been forgotten.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said western values andprinciples are behind the changes occurring in the Communist world.``We're winning economically, we're winning politically, we havethe other philosophy acknowledging that it is a failure,'' Bakersaid. ``So, whatever we're doing is working ... and for the timebeing I don't think we ought to ... say that we're going to changethat just for PR purposes.''   But the Gorbachev proposals are scoring public opinion points inwestern Europe, details and long-term merit notwithstanding. Evenas Bush called Gorbachev's latest offer ``forthcoming'' and said itheld promise for conventional force reductions, he said it does notalter the need for Western deterrence, which means nuclear weaponsin Europe.   ``These reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enough toeliminate the significant numerical superiority that the SovietUnion enjoys right now,'' the president said Wednesday.   Nevertheless, Bush has a problem not unlike the one he createdfor Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential campaign. In thosedays, Bush was the one making catchy proposals and accusations,leaving Dukakis to struggle through the fine print as he tried toexplain them away. Now, in a different kind of campaign, Gorbachevhas managed to do most of the sound-biting.   After Gorbachev's offer to cut conventional arms, Bush came backwith an accountant's challenge: ``I call on the Soviets to do as wehave always done. Let's open the ledgers, publish an accuratedefense budget.''   ``Open budgets openly arrived at'' is not a slogan likely tostir the Western alliance.   Ronald Reagan knew the public relations side of the arms controlbalance, and played to it.   A conservative candidate who had opposed arms limitation dealsbefore he came to office, Reagan boosted the defense budget andtook a hard line in early talks. And at the same time, he said thathe wasn't satisfied with strategic arms limitation efforts, that hewanted a strategic arms reduction treaty. No more SALT talks. STARTtalks. Later, the zero option, applied by treaty to intermediaterange nuclear missiles. That precedent is a problem now, with theWest Germans pressing for immediate negotiations on short-rangenuclear weapons and the administration wary of pressure toeliminate them, too.   Now Gorbachev has the edge in Moscow-Washington public relationscontest. His proposals position the administration as the naysayer.His offers come with such visual aids as flowers in Red Square onMay Day instead of glowering commissars reviewing missiles onparade.   Bush warns that such soothing signs must be read with prudence.``The West is being tested by complacency,'' he said.   Baker said the United States needs to be seen as creative andforward-looking in dealing with Gorbachev and the changing SovietUnion. But Baker said that doesn't mean ``going into an armscontrol grab bag and competing with him on that score.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
