The company, Agracetus, is a joint venture of W.R. Grace andamp; Co., New York, and Cetus Corp., Emeryville, Calif., a biotechnology concern.    An Agracetus group said it was able to add a foreign gene to cotton plants. The particular gene isn't commercially significant, but the technique suggests that other genetic changes could be made in cotton plants. The company said it would seek to develop plant lines with improved genetic traits such as increased insect resistance, early maturity, higher yield and improved fiber quality.    Although development of such plants could take years, if possible at all, such changes would have great significance. Insect control, for instance, is one of the major costs of raising cotton.    The technique is one of a number being developed by genetic engineering scientists to produce new varieties of plants that are genetically altered to resist disease and pests. </TEXT></DOC>
