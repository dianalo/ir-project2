The device represents a potentially important step towarda long-sought goal in medicine -- continuous monitoring ofacidity, oxygen and other crucial substances in the blood.Such monitors could give physicians early warning ofimpending crises in critically ill patients or in patientsundergoing surgery. The devices also someday may be used inautomated systems that release drugs into the body in dosesprecisely controlled to yield desired therapeutic benefitsand minimize side effects.</LP><TEXT>   Blood tests now typically require medical workers to drawblood into tubes for analyzing in remote laboratories, aprocess that can take minutes to hours. The method can leadto errors from naturally occurring changes in the chemistryof blood as it is moved, from contamination of the equipmentit touches and from mixups in handling.   During the past few years, bedside blood analyzers havebeen developed to speed measurements of certain bloodcomponents. But these devices require extracting bloodsamples from patients, hence still have time-delay and otherdrawbacks compared with the continuous, inside-the-bodymonitoring envisioned with fiber optic devices. Some 10 to 12companies &quot;have serious high-dollar projects&quot; to develop suchcontinuous monitors, said Stephen Shapiro, a medical devicesspecialist at Wilkerson Group Inc., a medical industryconsulting firm in New York.   In a report in today's issue of the journal Nature, theTufts researchers said they developed a prototype sensorsystem consisting of a light-analyzing device connected to asingle optical fiber that is designed to be threaded into anartery through a needle. The fiber, made of light-conductingstrands of glass or plastic, has multiple specks of&quot;indicator&quot; chemicals on its tip. The indicators are specialdyes through which light beams are passed; the intensity ofthe light emitted varies with the level of selected chemicalswith which the dyes are in contact.   The device works by sending light through the fiber to itssensing tip. A camera-like device then measures light thatreturns through the fiber after passing through one of thedyes.   The prototype measures acidity and carbon dioxide, saidDavid Walt, one of the Tufts researchers. The scientistsexpect soon to add a third indicator dye to measure oxygen,he added. Later they hope to add indicators for electrolytessuch as sodium, for enzymes released into the blood when aheart attack is starting and for other substances. Outsideexperts said the Tufts device appears to be the first sensorthat can register multiple substances with a single opticalfiber -- potentially making it cheaper, simpler tomanufacture and easier to get into arteries than alternativesensors being developed.   Dr. Walt, a chemist, cautioned that several major problemsstill must be solved to use such devices for continuous bloodmonitoring over several days. One is finding a way to preventclots that occur when foreign materials contact the blood.Another issue is sensor stability-indictor dyes tend to getbleached out over time, making their signals fade.   Dr. Walt added that several companies have &quot;approached us&quot;regarding development of the device for medical or other uses-- such as monitoring toxic chemicals during environmentalcleanups -- but declined to disclose their names. Heestimated that a marketable sensor costing several thousanddollars might be developed in five years or so.</TEXT></DOC>
