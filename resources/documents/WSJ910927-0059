In a letter to Congress, the Bush administration certifiedthat the $21 million in military assistance designated forJordan would be &quot;in the national interest&quot; and promote MiddleEast peace. The certification, which was expected, wasrequired to lift the ban enacted by lawmakers in April inresponse to Jordan's support for Iraq during the war. Mr.Bush's action will allow Jordan eventually to receive the aidallocated for fiscal 1991. Without certification, authorityfor the aid would have expired when the fiscal year endsSept. 30.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush suspended military aid to Jordan inFebruary after King Hussein repeatedly criticized the U.S.and its allies for organizing a military response to theinvasion of Kuwait. Jordan also voted against the UnitedNations resolutions condemning Iraq, and some analystsbelieved the country was a conduit for goods and weaponsallowing Iraq to evade the U.N.-sanctioned embargo.   Subsequently, however, the U.S. and Jordan have moved toimprove relations. Jordan agreed to attend a Middle Eastpeace conference and to sponsor a joint delegation with thePalestinians. The U.S. unlocked $35 million in economic aidalso suspended during the war.</TEXT></DOC>
