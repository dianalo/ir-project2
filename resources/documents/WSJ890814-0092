Green@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 08/14/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><IN> INSURANCE (INS)LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW) </IN><TEXT>   Five years ago, when CNA Insurance Cos. sold a liability policy to directors and officers of Home Savings andamp; Loan Association, Burien, Wash., it was worried about the growing peril of thrift failures. The big insurer specified in no uncertain terms that the policy didn't cover losses from suits brought by thrift regulators.    But a federal judge in Seattle didn't accept that clause at face value. In April, the judge ruled that the provision illegally hindered the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.'s ability to function as a receiver for the thrift, which had since failed. &quot;Private parties to an insurance contract may not frustrate the congressional purpose behind receivership by annulling FSLIC's federal powers,&quot; the judge ruled.    So, if the FSLIC wins a pending $5 million negligence suit against former directors and officers of Home Savings, the agency will be able to collect from CNA.    So it goes in the tumultuous business of directors' and officers' insurance. Once a standard-type policy that fostered relatively narrow litigation, it now is a pivotal source of money in the maze of civil damage suits brought against company directors by shareholders, employees and the government.    As a result, lawsuits just to interpret the policies are burgeoning, pitting insurers against everyone from plaintiffs to the companies that buy the policies to the insured executives themselves. This litigation, while concentrated now on the thrift industry, is by no means limited to it.    &quot;There's been an explosion in the last two or three years, and it's growing dramatically,&quot; says Kenneth Wollner, a risk-management consultant for Wyatt Co. in Chicago. &quot;It's an industry unto itself.&quot;    The results can be unpredictable. With little precedent to guide them in deciphering policies, judges often disagree on issues such as coverage of legal fees, whether a company -- as opposed to its officials -- can sometimes make a claim against a Dandamp;O policy, and whether an insurer can shield itself from certain government suits. In April, for example, a federal judge in Texas upheld a regulatory-exclusion clause similar to the one tossed out by the court in Seattle.    &quot;There really is not a consensus on these issues,&quot; says John Morrison, a defense attorney with Altheimer andamp; Gray in Chicago.    Disputes over coverage have existed as long as the Dandamp;O policy has, about 50 years. But as lawsuits against directors and officers mushroomed in the mid-1980s, so did the policy claims. Disputes snowballed as carriers tightened their coverage. And with millions of dollars at stake in judgments and out-of-court settlements, many of them are ending up in court.    &quot;A lot of directors are waking up to find they're the subject of shareholder suits, and insurance companies aren't giving them coverage,&quot; says James Hubbell, a lawyer in Denver with Kelly, Haglund, Garnsey andamp; Kahn.    Some legal specialists say directors don't pay enough attention to Dandamp;O coverage. Worse, they say, is a lack of communication between a company's legal department, which doesn't see insurance as very interesting work, and its risk managers, who find it hard to talk to lawyers. As a result, lawyers often don't thoroughly examine the Dandamp;O policies until after a lawsuit has been filed.    &quot;It's like wills,&quot; Mr. Morrison says. &quot;You don't know how good it is until after the fact.&quot;    Once a suit against directors and officers is filed, it doesn't take long for Dandamp;O policy disputes to follow. An early issue: Who pays the continuing cost of defending against the suit? Most executives look to the carrier, sometimes only to find policy clauses giving the insurer the &quot;option&quot; to advance legal expenses. And some carriers opt to pay only when liability is determined -- &quot;many years and many millions of dollars later,&quot; as Mr. Wollner puts it.    &quot;That has been the most litigated issue,&quot; says Dan A. Bailey, a lawyer with Arter andamp; Hadden in Columbus, Ohio. The courts are divided, but lawyers say a slight majority has endorsed a pay-as-you-go system. Mr. Bailey says most carriers are now trying to confront the question up front, by specifying in the policy whether they're obligated to advance legal costs.    Another sticky problem is whether the company that buys a Dandamp;O policy should benefit from it. Such policies cover only directors and officers; but since most shareholder suits name both the company and individuals as defendants, it's sometimes hard to separate their liability. PepsiCo Inc. and Continental Casualty Cos. still are battling over how much the carrier should pay of a $22 million settlement PepsiCo and its directors reached in 1985 with a shareholder who sued them over allegedly false PepsiCo financial statements.    A federal court ruled in 1986 that Continental's Dandamp;O policy clearly covered only directors and officers, but it said Continental bore the burden of proving what portion of a settlement should be excluded from the coverage. PepsiCo and Continental will go to trial on that question later this year unless an agreement is negotiated.    &quot;That's one of the big issues on the horizon,&quot; Mr. Bailey says. &quot;There are scores of cases pending and even more situations where it's being discussed.&quot;    Also looming is the question of whether regulators, acting as receivers for failed institutions, can collect on Dandamp;O policies in damage suits they bring against former officers and directors. At the root of this dispute are provisions in many policies excluding coverage of lawsuits brought by a company against its own officers and directors. Some insurers resist claims from regulators by arguing that the regulators, as receivers, are standing in the company's shoes.    That argument apparently has limitations. In January, a federal judge in Arkansas said it wouldn't preclude the FSLIC, as receiver for failed FirstSouth, from collecting on a Dandamp;O policy issued by American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pa. &quot;The stated purpose of the policy is to insure the officers and directors against loss from claims made for breach of duty,&quot; the judge ruled. &quot;This purpose would be entirely defeated or very severely restricted if suits brought by the FSLIC were not covered.&quot;    Carriers also have had mixed success explicitly precluding coverage of regulatory actions. The Seattle judge, for example, said such a clause violates federal policy. The judge in the FirstSouth case found such a provision too vague. But in Lubbock, Texas, last April, a U.S. district judge said the clause barred a claim by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., acting as receiver for Seminole State National Bank. He found &quot;unpersuasive&quot; rulings by other courts saying such provisions violate public policy.    Fresh disputes, meanwhile, are cropping up. In Florida, a federal judge held that International Insurance Co. must reimburse directors of Southwest Florida Banks Inc. for some $1.4 million they had to return to the company. The sum was a portion of the money the directors had received under a &quot;golden parachute&quot; agreement. They returned it to settle a shareholder suit against the directors that had challenged the plan as a waste of corporate assets.    International contended that the repayments weren't &quot;losses&quot; covered by the Dandamp;O policy, but the judge disagreed. In June, the U.S. Circuit Court in Atlanta upheld his ruling. Lawyers say the case may prompt carriers to exclude such coverage. Golden parachutes often are used to discourage takeovers, and that attracts shareholder suits. &quot;I think it's something carriers might respond to,&quot; says Mr. Morrison.    ---@ Directors on the Defensive @ Sources of lawsuits filed against company directors and officers, 1979-87: @ (In percent) @ Shareholders 46.9% @ Employees 21.5 @ Customers 19.6 @ Other 5.8 @ Competitors 3.8 @ Government 2.4 @ Lawsuits against officers and directors per 100 companies*: @ 1988 88 @ 1986 75 @ 1984 67 @ 1982 60 @ 1980 58 @ 1978 52 @ *Note: Companies with assets over $1 billion @ Source: Wyatt Corp. survey of 1,708 corporations </TEXT></DOC>
