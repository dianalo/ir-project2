NIST perceives that analytical measurement tasksare ripe for automation technologies and that development of automatedanalytical laboratory offers U.S. industry opportunities for significantimprovements in the quality and cost of their analytical operations. Toaccelerate development of these benefits and to provide a broad utilizationbase, NIST proposes the establishment of an industry-government researchconsortium. Parties planning to attend should make reservations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The meeting will be on September 28, from 8:30 a.m. to5:00 p.m., followed by the consortium's first organizational meeting onSept. 29, 1989, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Meeting will be held at the National Institute of Standardsand Technology, Conference Room A, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Howard M.

These measurements providecritical feedback in many situations, such as, product quality assurance,acceptance testing, and regulatory compliances.These analytical measurements are generally viewed with mixed feelings.On the positive side, industry recognizes that improvements in productand process capability often depend upon improvements in the analyticalmeasurement technologies. A firm's competitiveness depends in part on theaccuracy, sensitivity, reliability, and controllability of its measurementsand processess. This precision and control are reflected in the qualityand cost of the firm's products. On the negative side, analytical measurementsare expensive because they are labor intensive, utilizing high cost personneland expensive equipment.NIST scientists project that in the next decade, analytical measurementcapabilities will experience technical growth equal to that of the previousthree decades combined. Furthermore, NIST perceives that analytical measurementtasks are ripe for automation technologies and that development of automatedanalytical laboratory offers U.S. industry opportunities for significantimprovements in the quality and cost of their analytical operations. Toaccelerate development of these benefits and to provide a broad utilizationbase, NIST proposes the establishment of an industry-government researchconsortium.<ITAG tagnum="84">Consortium Philosophy</ITAG>The basic philosophy of this Consortium is that industrial community andNIST work as a team to develop automated chemical analysis technologies.NIST believes that ``working shoulder to shoulder'' enriches all involvedin the research effort. Active industrial involvement focuses the researchon industrial needs, and accelerates the transfer of technology to memberfirms. This philosophy of active involvement is reflected in the consortiumdesign. The more a Consortium member contributes to the active reasearchof the Consortium, the more benefits the Consortium member accrues. Membersof the NIST Consortium will have:1. An active voice in setting the research agenda and research priorities;2. The opportunity to collaborate actively in the development of Consortiumtechnologies;3. The intellectual property (publications and patents) benefits in technologiesdeveloped by the Consortium; and4. Accesss to research seminars, workshops, and training sessions on Consortiumactivities and products.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Consortium Focus and Objectives</ITAG>The focus of the consortium is on the automation of (organic and inorganic)analytic laboratory methods and processes. The objectives of the consortiumresearch are to:1. Automate organic and inorganic laboratory procedure. This requires thatresearch must develop generally applicable analytic procedures that canbe automated; and, apply these ``automated procedures'' to common laboratoryfunctions.2. Build chemical analysis expertise into the operation of the laboratorysystem. The system will be ``smart'' as well as automated. Expert systemsand other forms of Artificial Intelligence will be woven into the systemto play appropriate roles in guiding the various operations of the chemicalanalysis.3. Develop standard reference methods to be used and applied on automatedanalytical laboratory systems. These activities are necessary to establishthe validity of these techniques and aid their implementation to replacecommonly employed manual techniques. Implementation of these automatedstandard methods will be accomplished with the active involvement of voluntarystandards organizations, professional societies, and regulatory agencies.4. Build in quality assurance into the automated system; i.e., to developthe automated analytical system so that it will monitor and requlate theprocedural conditions to provide a highly controlled environment for theanalysis. These mothods can be used to ensure reproducibility and transferabilityof the results.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Raymond G.
