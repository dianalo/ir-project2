The Israeli troops sustained no casualties.   In Beirut, the radical Fatah-Revolutionary Council, headed byreputed terrorist Abu Nidal, said the guerrillas had crossed theborder into northern Israel before dawn and ``wiped out a unit ofIsraeli guards'' in a shootout that lasted several hours.   An Israeli patrol spotted the guerrilla squad during the night inthe area of Meiss El-Jabal village, several yards north of theborder, and opened fire, killing the three guerrillas, the Israeliarmy command said.   Soldiers found Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles, ammunition,anti-tank rocket launchers, leaflets and other equipment near thebodies of the guerrillas, the army said.   It gave no other details. Israel army radio said the soldiers whotook part in the clash were from the elite paratrooper brigade andthat the guerrillas apparently were on their way to stage ahostage-taking operation in Israel.   The clash was in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, a six-to10-mile-wide buffer strip north of the border carved out in 1985when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon.   The zone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and the South LebanonArmy, an Israeli-backed, mostly Christian militia.   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council communique did not say whathappened to the infiltrators.   Lebanese police said four other guerrillas of the PopularStruggle Front apparently were heading for Israel when their rubberdinghy ran aground near the coastal town of Jiye, 15 miles south ofBeirut. Three guerrillas drowned and one surrendered to Syriantroops at a checkpoint near Jiye, police said.   The two incidents suggested that radical factions opposed toPalestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat were benton escalating their warfare against Israel, possibly to scuttleArafat's recent peace overtures.   Fatah-Revolutionary Council and the Popular Struggle Front areamong the splinter groups that have rejected Arafat's explicitrecognition of Israel and the PLO's dialogue with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
