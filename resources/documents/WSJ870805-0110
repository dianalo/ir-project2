NEC, one of Japan's biggest electronics concerns, strongly denied the report.    Investigators at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is responsible for enforcing export restrictions, acknowledged that several cases are under investigation but wouldn't elaborate. A top investigator at the National Police Agency said no company is under specific investigation.    The report appeared in yesterday afternoon's edition of the Mainichi Shimbun, which cited sources in Washington. It sent NEC's stock tumbling 200 yen, or 9.8%, in Tokyo, to 1,840 yen ($12.27). In over-the-counter trading in the U.S. yesterday, NEC's American Depositary Receipts fell $5.625, or 8.4%, to $61.625. Volume totaled 126,800 ADRs, up sharply from the daily average of 30,154 over the past two months. Each ADR represents five common shares.    Rumors that several large Japanese companies were involved in export violations have circulated in Tokyo and Washington following the disclosure that Toshiba Machine Corp., 50.1%-owned by Toshiba Corp., sold sophisticated milling machines to the Soviet Union, which used them to build quiet submarines that are difficult to detect.    In Washington, U.S. officials acknowledged that intelligence data shared by Washington and Tokyo authorities suggest that a number of Japanese companies besides Toshiba Machine could have been involved in export-control violations. But they denied that the administration has identified these companies to the Japanese press.    A spokesman for the Defense Technology Security Administration said a Pentagon team headed by Fred Ikle, undersecretary of defense for policy, had warned Japanese authorities about such possible violations during a Tokyo visit last December. The U.S. team brought three cases to the attention of the Japanese but didn't publicly identify the companies involved. &quot;That's entirely the responsibility of the Japanese government,&quot; the spokesman said.    The Mainichi Shimbun said that a second Japanese company, which it speculated could be Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. or Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. or &quot;another heavy-industry company,&quot; is also being investigated for possible violations of export restrictions determined by the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, a Paris-based watchdog group created by the U.S. and its allies.    A spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy said, &quot;We aren't doing anything which may constitute a violation of the regulations.&quot; The company has received no inquiries from MITI, the spokesman said. Tsutae Hyodo, a vice president of Sumitomo Heavy, said, &quot;We rechecked our exported items, but there was nothing that constitutes a violation of the Cocom rules.&quot;    At NEC, a spokesman said that &quot;MITI isn't investigating us.&quot; He added: &quot;As we've said before, NEC has always observed Cocom rules and hasn't done anything to violate them. That includes our subsidiaries.&quot;    Toshiba faces the threat of tough sanctions by the U.S. The Senate has approved an amendment to its trade bill that would give President Reagan the option to ban imports from Toshiba or any of its subsidiaries for as long as five years. The House has voted to ban the sale of all Toshiba products at U.S. military stores around the world.    Trading in NEC in Tokyo was halted twice yesterday because of an order imbalance. Shares of the other companies dropped, but by a lesser amount. Sumitomo Heavy closed at 319 yen, down eight yen, or 2.4%, and Mitsubishi Heavy closed at 550 yen, down 22 yen, or 3.9%.    &quot;People were ready to pull the trigger even before the news was confirmed,&quot; said Darrel Whitten, associate director of research for Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd. Thomas Murtha, technology analyst at James Capel andamp; Co., said: &quot;NEC is in the unfortunate position of being considered guilty until proven innocent in the eyes of the market.&quot; He said NEC is &quot;one of the highest-quality investments in Japan.&quot;    The Mainichi report contributed to yesterday's overall decline on the Tokyo market, analysts said. The Nikkei average of 225 stocks fell 311.22 yen, to close at 24172.60. &quot;The news about NEC threw cold water on the electricals,&quot; Mr. Whitten said.    Shares of two NEC subsidiaries also fell on rumors that they were involved in transactions. Japan Aviation Electronics Industry Ltd., 50.3%-owned by NEC, was off 140 yen, or 10.7%, to 1,160 yen, and Ando Electric Co., which is 51.1%-owned by NEC, fell 300 yen, or almost 7%, to 4,000 yen. </TEXT></DOC>
