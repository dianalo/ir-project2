Saddam Hussein almost single-handedly propelled Brazilinto the select club of arms exporters with big orders duringhis eight-year war againt Iran. But his war with the U.S.-ledalliance could well be the nail in the coffin for Brazil'salready troubled arms industry, company officials and defenseanalysts say.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Everything indicates that {Brazil} will stop being a bigexporter of defense equipment,&quot; says retired Col. GeraldoLesbat Cavagnari, head of the Strategic Studies Center of theUniversity of Campinas.   The reason: Brazil's arms industry, faced with a nearlybankrupt state and declining domestic defense spending,relies almost entirely on exports to the Persian Gulf. Thepresence of Brazilian-made Astros II rocket-launchers andCascavel or Urutu armored vehicles in both the Iraqi andallied armies attests to Brazil's past success. But Brazil isadhering to the embargo against Iraq, and when the dustsettles in the Gulf, analysts predict, Iraq is unlikely to bemaking big arms orders.   Other potential clients, such as Saudi Arabia, the UnitedArab Emirates and a restored Kuwait, will probably becomehooked on the much more sophisticated weapons that the U.S.and its Western allies are deploying there. That will leaveBrazil's arms industry, until recently a Third Worldindustrial success story, without any obvious markets, thusprecipitating an industrial shakeout, analysts say.   &quot;War in the Gulf closes the last door to exports ofdefense material. The Gulf is a market that's disappeared forus,&quot; says Joao Verdi de Carvalho Leite, president of ailingdefense group Avibras Aerospacial, which hasn't suspendedtechnical assistance to Iraq for the 560 Astros II missilesystems that it sold to Baghdad, despite the embargo. AForeign Ministry spokesman contends providing instructiondoesn't constitute a violation of the embargo, because it's acontractual arrangement that doesn't involve shipment ofmateriel.   Mr. Verdi adds that Gulf countries &quot;will seek equipmentfrom countries that are fighting on their side now. The onlyexport market is the poor countries of Africa that don't haveany money to buy&quot; arms.   Rene Dreifuss, a strategic studies expert at Rio'sFluminense Federal University, concurs: &quot;War in the Gulf hascompletely changed the armaments requirements of countries inthe region. From now on, they will want sophisticatedequipment that Brazil doesn't and cannot produce.&quot;   The prospect of Brazil playing a lesser role in the armsfield will deal a blow to the country's national pride.Brazil's meteoric sucess in developing a competitivearms-exporting business underpinned its aspirations of beingthe industrial leader of the developing world. But thescaling back of Brazil's arms exports will likely be welcomedby the U.S., which has often assailed Brazil forindiscriminatory sales to terrorism-sponsoring nations suchas Libya and its alleged role in helping Iraq develop itsnuclear capabilities.   To be sure, Brazil still retains industrial capability inthe defense field and still has weapons to sell. Despite thegrowing talk of losing the Middle East market, another ailingpillar of Brazil's defense industry, EngenheirosEspecializados S.A., or Engesa, is still rumored to be tryingto sell its Osorio tanks to Saudi Arabia. Engesa officialsrefuse to comment, but industry officials are skeptical ofEngesa's chances.   But most analysts say the likely dearth of major orders inthe foreseeable future will make it impossible to sustain theindustry as it currently stands, forcing companies intodifficult choices and accelerating an already nascent trendtoward diversification by Brazil's three main companies --Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A., or Embraer, Avibrasand Engesa -- and their suppliers.   &quot;Brazil's arms industry was a house of cards that'scollapsing,&quot; says Domicio Proenca Junior, a professor ofstrategic studies at the graduate school of engineering ofRio's Federal University. &quot;I think the industry willdisappear,&quot; he says, though there can be &quot;cosmetic solutions&quot;to maintain brands and certain products. Adds Mr. Dreifuss:&quot;Either the companies find a niche in the lower intermediatetechnology range, and this could mean alliances andconcentration, or they find some kind of specialization, likemaking components, or they'll close down. There won't be amade-in-Brazil, competitive, finished product&quot; on a bigscale, he says.   Avibras's plight typifies the problems of Brazil's defenseindustry. In 1987, the company was Brazil's biggestprivate-sector exporter, selling $322 million of Astros IIrocket-launchers and missiles. But when the Iran-Iraq warcame to an end, so did Avibras's big sales to Baghdad. Stuckwith $100 million in unsold rockets, owed an estimated $45million by Iraq and with 1989 sales down to about $38 millionfrom $355 million in 1987, the company filed for protectionfrom creditors last year. It hopes to survive bydiversification into such products as television antennas.Its staff has been cut from a peak of 7,000 in 1987 to about700 today.   Late last year, Avibras managed to sell 10,000 rockets toSaudi Arabia for $69 million, but Mr. Verdi is pessimisticabout future military sales. Because the U.S. and the Britishare prime players in the defense of Saudi Arabia, he says,&quot;it would be natural&quot; for the Saudis to arm themselves withtheir weapons. For Avibras, seeking to come out ofreceivership as a slimmer, diversified company, &quot;1991 will bea dark year,&quot; he says.   Engesa, a maker of tanks and armored vehicles, also filedfor protection from creditors last year after its sales toIraq and Libya collapsed, and the hoped-for big sale ofOsorio tanks to Saudi Arabia failed to materialize.   Even Embraer, long a star of Brazilian industry, is incrisis. Faced with an acute cash crunch despite firingone-third of its staff of 12,500, Chief Executive OzilioSilva resigned last month and was succeeded by Joao Cunha, aformer Finance Ministry official. But he faces a dualchallenge, analysts say. On the military aviation side,orders have been falling for the AMX subsonic fighter jetthat Embraer is developing jointly with Italy's Aermacchi andAeritalia. On the civil aviation side, Embraer said last weekit was suspending plans to build the twin-turboprop, 19-seatCBA-123 Vector commuter airliner for lack of orders.</TEXT></DOC>
