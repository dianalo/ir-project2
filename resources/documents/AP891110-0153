HIGGINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East German Ambassador Gerhard Herder saidFriday his country would be a ``predictable partner'' of the Westin maintaining peace but warned that any miscalculation in reactingto the liberalization of his homeland could lead to conflict.   Herder noted that armed forces of three allies are stationed inBerlin _ the United States, Britain and France.   ``By any miscalculation, they could be involved. This could leadto a conflict,'' he said in a speech at the National Press Club.   The Soviet Union also has troops in Berlin, and the city itselflies more than 100 miles inside East Germany and the East Germanand Soviet forces of the Warsaw Pact.   ``I don't want to hide before you that these developments arevery dangerous. They could lead, if they get out of control, tobigger conflicts.''   Herder said President Bush's reaction to the events in Berlinwas ``encouraging'' and said he hoped the changes in his countrywould open up a new phase in relations with the United States.   ``My country has always been in the forefront'' of efforts tomaintain stability in Central Europe and intends to remain ``apredictable partner'' of the West in that effort.   His government's decision to grant freedom of travel isirreversible: ``If there are still people who believe the changesare cosmetic, they are victims of an outlived era of suspicion andmistrust.''   He was asked whether he could foresee a unified Germany.   ``In my dreams, yes. But being a politician, I don't see anyprospect for a united Germany,'' Herder said, because East and WestGermany are ``integrated into military alliances guaranteeing astable balance of power'' in Europe.   Asked whether the December meeting between Bush and SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev would decide German reunification,Herder said, ``I don't think it's a matter to be decided by Mr.Bush and Mr. Gorbachev'' but rather a matter to be decided by thepeople of the two Germanies.   Asked whether he could envisage a crackdown similar to that byChinese authorities against pro-democracy demonstrators inBeijing's Tiananmen Square last June, Herder said, ``I exclude itpersonally and I can tell you'' the East German government iscommitted to ``solve all problems by political means.''   Asked whether the Berlin Wall would come down, he replied, ``Weshould have no illusions and not be led by euphoria.''</TEXT></DOC>
