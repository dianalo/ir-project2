SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Next year's national head count could cost $3billion, Congress was told Thursday. But Census Bureau officialsdoubt they'll have to spend quite that much.   ``We estimate that the 1990 census will cost about $2.6billion,'' deputy census director C. Louis Kincannon told the Housecensus subcommittee.   But Gene L. Dodaro of the General Accounting Office told thesubcommittee he believes the bureau is underestimating the cost.   ``On the basis of continued inflation and more current costestimates, we believe that the 1990 census, as planned, will costabout $3 billion,'' Dodaro testified.   Kincannon responded that ``factors outside our control, such aslower than expected mail-return rates or productivity, couldincrease costs,'' but added that ``we do not expect that to happen.''   The 1980 national head count eventually cost $1.1 billion.Initial estimates had been lower.   More than 100 million census forms will be mailed a year fromnow, with the constitutionally mandated count scheduled for April 1,1990.   ``Political representation and money are allocated based oncensus results and the data are used for planning at every level ofgovernment and in the private sector,'' Kincannon pointed out.   He and Dodaro agreed that a major problem will be recruiting theestimated 480,000 temporary workers the bureau is expected to needto do the counting.   In test counts last year, Kincannon said, the bureau found thatits planned wage range of $5.50 to $6 an failed to attract workersin some areas. Thus, he said, officials are developing a regionalpay scale keyed to local costs and salaries.   Even so, with many two-earner families, fewer people areavailable to recruit for these temporary jobs.   Rep. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., suggested one possible solutionwould be to recruit census enumerators from among retired federalworkers around the country, if rules can be changed to allow them tobe paid without reducing their retirement benefits.   Dodaro and Kincannon supported that idea. Ridge and Rep. ThomasC. Sawyer, D-Ohio, said they were introducing legislation to allowthe retirees to take these temporary jobs without benefit cuts.   Kincannon also said major efforts are underway to better countthe homeless and minorities.   Meanwhile, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fundlaunched its effort to encourage Hispanics to be counted.   With the census numbers used to apportion seats in the House,state legislatures and other governing bodies, many minority groupswill be encouraging members to participate in the count.   ``Hagase contar,'' or ``Make Yourself Count,'' is the slogan ofthe Mexican-American effort.</TEXT></DOC>
