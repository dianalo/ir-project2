(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Avtex Fibers Inc. was fined $6.15 millionfor polluting the Shenandoah River and ordered to pay to clean theriver of a cancer-causing chemical discharged by its rayon plant.   Richmond Circuit Judge Theodore J. Markow said the companyprobably had been discharging polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs,into the river since 1983 from its plant in Front Royal, 70 mileswest of Washington, D.C.   Attorney General Mary Sue Terry said the decision Wednesdayshows that ``respect for the environment is good business inVirginia.''   Avtex spokesman Jeff Nelson was out of his office and could notbe reached for comment.   The company's attorneys told Markow last week that Avtexcouldn't pay fines or cleanup costs because the 50-year-old rayonplant shut down Nov. 10 under order from the State Water ControlBoard. Avtex operates another fiber plant in Pennsylvania.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has placed a lien of upto $40 million on the plant property and the Virginia attorneygeneral's office has seized saleable items in the plant in case thecompany files for bankruptcy.   Markow acknowledged Avtex's efforts since August to clean up PCBcontamination at the 440-acre plant site, but he chastised thecompany for ignoring evidence of PCB spills in 1983 and late 1985.   He called the pollution ``a public nuisance'' that had damagedthe river significantly. The Virginia Department of Health advisedin May against consuming fish caught from the river near FrontRoyal.   The closure of the plant put 442 employees out of work andstopped the manufacture of a carbonized yarn used in rocket nozzleson the space shuttle and nuclear missiles. Government officialssaid stockpiles of the yarn would last until a second manufactureris approved.   The judgment included a $3 million fine for discharging PCBsinto the river, plus various fines and penalties for violatingwater quality and worker safety regulations.</TEXT></DOC>
