Technically it is now possible to dispose ofthe wastes safely so that the spectre of a human disaster due to themismanagement of radioactive wastes need not exist. The sources of ionisingradiation, both natural and artificial, are considered and values ofthe radiation levels and annual public radiation dose in the United Kingdomare given. The monitoring and regulating system for radiological safetyare also explained. With the problem set in perspective, the currentand proposed options for disposing of the wastes are considered. Thesafety case for land disposal and disposal of long-lived wastes are discussed.Although the technical problems have been solved, the political aspectsof radioactive waste disposal are such that it is still a controversialissue. The reasons for this are discussed. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
