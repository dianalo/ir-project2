ManuelAntonio Noriega.   ``I will shout it to the world until justice is done and thetruth is known,'' Luz Elaine Lorenzo said Tuesday as she driedtears from her eyes at her husband's coffin.   She denied rumors that Capt. Nicasio Lorenzo had hanged himselfafter the coup attempt Oct. 3. The coroner's report said he died ofasphyxiation.   At the funeral, she called him ``a very Catholic man, a god tohis children, and they are not going to sully his name.''   Lorenzo, 36, was one of 27 officers arrested after the coupattempt. He was an adjutant to former intelligence chief Col.Guillermo Wong, who was also jailed. Eight rebel officers werekilled on the day of the coup, when troops loyal to Noriega putdown the rebellion.   The government has denied reports some coup leaders wereexecuted after they surrendered.   America Torres de McEnfresh, Lorenzo's mother-in-law, said thefamily was told Monday morning by the district attorney's office topick up his body at the morgue.   ``I saw him for the last time on Tuesday morning (Oct. 3),''Mrs. Lorenzo said. ``He did what he always did. He went jogging,came back dressed in civilian clothes, very sporty, we kissed andthen he left at about 7:30 a.m.''   ``He never would have committed suicide,'' she told reporters.``He was a religious man. He taught us to love God. None took foodhere without blessing it first.''   Also Tuesday, the government took new steps against critics ofNoriega, decreeing after a Cabinet meeting that governmentemployees who take part in ``anti-government activities'' may befired.   Many government employees were reported to have celebrated andtaunted their supervisors while rebels held the militaryheadquarters on Oct. 3, thinking the coup had been a success.   The government also decreed laws Tuesday that freeze wages ofpublic employees and cancel Christmas and year-end bonuses.   In another move against a perennial critic, the governmenteliminated the Education Ministry's national personnel board, whichassigned teaching positions.   A communique said the new laws were intended to protect ``theeconomy and the national security from the aggression of the U.S.government the past two years.''   ``They are repressive measures,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon,leader of the opposition Christian Democrat Party. ``I think theyare the first steps toward developing a police state.''   Noriega, in announcing last week that the laws were forthcoming,said ``here there will be no room for traitors nor jobs for thetraitors,'' an apparent reference to the government employees.   As chief of the Defense Forces, Noriega is the real power in thegovernment.   Also Tuesday, the government said it will send representativesto the Oct. 23-28 meeting of the Panama Canal Commission's board ofdirectors in Tampa, Fla. It had boycotted the last two meetings ofthe joint U.S.-Panamanian board, saying Washington might bring upthe political conflict between the two countries.   Since Noriega was indicted in February 1988 on charges ofsmuggling drugs into the United States and laundering drug money,Washington has been applying economic sanctions and other pressureson Panama to force Noriega out.   Noriega denies involvement in drug trafficking and claims theUnited States is trying to force him out because it wants to renegeon 1977 treaties that cede control of the Panama Canal by the endof the century.</TEXT></DOC>
