City Manager Cesar Odio froze a $15,000 city subsidy to theLittle Havana Kiwanis Club, which sponsors the event, on grounds thegroup may have violated its contract barring political or religiousactivities in the festival.   Dade County authorities also held up another $15,000 paymentaimed at helping to market the gigantic street party, slated to beheld Sunday.   ``Calle Ocho is a Mardi Gras of all cultures of Spanish-speakingbackground,'' said Yvette Morgan of the National Conference ofPuerto Rican Women, one of the critics of the ban. ``It has alwaysbeen for all Hispanic arts, not just for the anti-communists.''   About 40 Puerto Rican men and women picketed outside the KiwanisClub offices Friday in the Little Havana neighborhood, chanting andcarrying signs saying ``This is the United States'' and ``Pepsi-Colais in Russia, why not Montanez in Calle Ocho?'', referring to one ofthe banned performers, Puerto Rican singer Andy Montanez.   Kiwanis leaders insisted again Friday they will not back downfrom their strict rule barring anyone who has performed in Cubasince Fidel Castro's revolution. They said the last-minute freeze ofgovernment subsidies should not seriously affect the festitval.   ``Our policy has to stay for this year,'' insisted KiwanisPresident Pedro Menendez. ``It's too late to change it.''   However, he emphasized that the Kiwanis had not deliberatelypicked a fight over the issue, and were simply trying not to offendthe city's large anti-communist Cuban community.   ``This has definitely gone too far,'' Menendez said. ``Ouroriginal intention was not to insult certain segments of ourcommunity, and apparently, by trying to do that, we have insultedother people.''   Three Latin singers _ Montanez; Brazilian Denise de Kalafe; andSpain's De Raymond _ have been banned already this year by theKiwanis because they made appearances in Cuba as long as 20 yearsago.   And on Friday, Menendez said they might also exclude famedmerengue singer Wilfrido Vargas of the Dominican Republic, who iscredited as performing on a record album made in Cuba a decade ago.Menendez said Kiwanis officials were checking to confirm that he wasreally there.   All the singers have strongly condemned Castro's government.   The Miami Herald withdrew its sponsorship of Calle Ocho after DeRaymond _ scheduled to sing with the duo Los Espanolisimos on anewspaper-sponsored stage _ was dropped because of a 1978 appearancein Cuba.   De Raymond said the ban was particularly painful for him becausehe was barred from Spain's Socialist-run television for six yearsbecause of his strong anti-communist views. ``I deserve a tribute,not a ban,'' De Raymond said.   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez has also condemned the bans.   ``The position the Kiwanis have taken is really hurting them andthe city,'' Suarez said. ``It is a very extreme position for them totake _ one I don't think too many people agree with, even in theCuban community.''   Some in the Cuban community support the tough stand, however,saying the performers had insulted the exiles here, who considerthemselves refugees of an autocratic regime.   ``I can't see people having festivals in Miami Beach and invitingpeople who performed for Hitler,'' said state Rep. LincolnDiaz-Balart.   Calle Ocho _ which means Eighth Street in Spanish, named for themain thoroughfare of Little Havana where it takes place _ has becomethe nation's largest Latin festival in only 10 years. It attracts amillion people as well as top entertainment from around LatinAmerica.</TEXT></DOC>
