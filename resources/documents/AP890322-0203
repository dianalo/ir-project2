JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 100 million Americans live withpolluted air that at times exceeds federal health standards, butofficials said Wednesday air quality is markedly better than it wasa decade ago.   The Environmental Protection Agency's annual report on airquality singled out ozone pollution and carbon monoxide emissions,both largely blamed on automobiles, as being of continuing concernin urban areas where air pollution problems are greatest.   Ozone levels increased 5 percent between 1986 and 1987 and jumpedanother 14 percent in 1988 because of increased pollution and aparticularly hot summer that aggravated the problem. Ozone is thechief ingredient of smog which plagues many urban areas.   The EPA report tracked air quality from 1978 to 1987 for fivepollutants and through 1988 for ozone, which is formed whenhydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides interact in sunlight and heat.   Across the board, the long-term figures showed significantimprovements in levels of each of six major pollutants, although inthe most recent years the progress in combating some of thepollutants has been slowed or even reversed.   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, although noting progress insome areas, said the figures on ozone and carbon monoxide``underscores'' the need for stronger air quality laws.   Donald Clay, the agency's top official for air quality, calledthe ozone pollution ``probably the most pervasive health problemthat we have'' among the pollutants examined. The EPA estimated that88.6 million people live in counties where ozone pollution exceededfederal standards at some point in 1987 and 1988.   Last year the EPA listed 66 areas of the country where ozonelevels were considered unhealthy and ``early indications are thatabout 30 additional areas may eventually join the list,'' said theEPA.   In addition to ozone, the pollutants covered by the air qualityreport were: sulfur dioxide, a source of acid rain which also cancause lung damage; carbon monoxide, a pollutant largely fromautomobiles which can seriously affect the heart and brain; nitrogendioxide, which contributes to bronchitis and pneumonia; ambientlead, which can cause brain and nervous system damage; and suspendedparticulates that cause breathing problems.   Here are the EPA assessments for each:   _Carbon monoxide: Levels in the air were cut by 32 percent since1978 and 6 percent from 1986 to 1987, but actual emissions wereslightly higher in 1987 than the previous year. The increase wasblamed on forest fires.   But an estimated 29.4 million people continue to live in countieswhere carbon monoxide levels exceed federal standards. While thehighest concentration during an eight-hour period in 1987 was foundin New York City, 21 metropolitan areas in all exceeded the federalstandards.   _Sulfur dioxide: Levels in the air were cut 35 percent since 1978and 3 percent in 1987 from the previous year. Almost all regions ofthe country fell within federal standards for sulfur dioxide. Theexception was Pittsburgh, where a monitoring site reported levelshigher than the EPA considers healthy in a region with 1.6 millionpeople.   _Nitrogen dioxide: Levels have been reduced by 12 percent since1978, but ambient levels showed no change during the last year ofthe study period. Emissions of nitrogen dioxide actually increasedslightly from 1986 to 1987.   Levels are relatively high in the Northeast, but the Los Angelesarea with a population of more than 7.5 million is the only regionin the country where ambient nitrogen dioxide exceeds federalstandards.   _Lead: This showed the greatest improvement, largely because ofthe gradual switch since 1978 to use of unleaded gasoline. Ambientlead levels fell 88 percent from 1978, including a 19 percentreduction from 1986 to 1987.   But the EPA reported that 1.7 million people, most of them nearindustrial plants using lead, continue to be exposed to air thatexceeds federal ambient lead levels of 1.5 micrograms per cubicliter.   _Suspended particulates: These include dirt, dust and soot.Levels have been reduced by 21 percent since 1978, but ambientlevels increased by 3 percent in 1987 over the previous year. TheEPA blamed the increase on forest fires. Nearly 22 million peoplelived in counties where the levels exceeded federal standards.</TEXT></DOC>
