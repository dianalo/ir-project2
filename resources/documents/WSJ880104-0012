The trouble began Saturday with a dawn raid on the home of Mr. Li, currently a vice chairman of the exchange, by Hong Kong's anti-bribery agency, the Independent Commission Against Corruption. He was freed the same day on bail, without being charged, pending further inquiries. Also freed were two others arrested Saturday --Jeffrey Sun, the exchange's chief executive, and Donald Tsang, head of its listing department.    The listing department, which vets applications from companies seeking to go public, is one of the exchange's most powerful units. The ICAC would say only that it is probing the exchange's operations but declined to say if the listing department is its focus. For the stock exchange, however, the arrests are just a start to its trauma.    Even as the three were questioned by ICAC officers, the government took a series of emergency measures to contain the fallout.    The steps, at least for the unspecified duration of the investigation, have in effect stripped the authority from a small clique of brokers that has long dominated the stock market. The group includes Mr. Li and Charles Sin, who succeeded Mr. Li as chairman Dec. 16.    Left to pick up the pieces is Robert Fell.    A retired Hong Kong banking commissioner, Mr. Fell was hired by the exchange as senior chief executive to polish its tarnished image after its controversial four-day trading suspension during October's global market crash. Amid the current upheaval, he has been given additional responsibility over the entire administration of the exchange. And he had to spend much of the weekend assuring the investment world that Hong Kong's market would open as usual today.    The weekend upheaval once again has highlighted Hong Kong's image as a loosely regulated financial center that lurches from crisis to crisis. Where the colony goes from here, many brokers say, depends on whether the government can take a stronger hand in ensuring that local financial markets are run well.    &quot;Hong Kong has grown into a financial center very quickly without enough appreciation that we are now one of the big boys and need to play by international rules,&quot; Mr. Fell said.    &quot;In the long run, it is better that the government demonstrates resolve in making sure things are done properly,&quot; said Philip Smiley, research director of brokerage W.I. Carr (Far East) Ltd.    But in the short run the stock market may take a beating. Share prices already had been expected to come under pressure from worries about the plunging U.S. dollar. The corruption investigation, which has been widely reported locally and overseas, may make investors more nervous. In early trading in Hong Kong today, the Hang Seng index fell in the first 15 minutes to 2199, more than 100 points from Thursday's close of 2302. Fifteen minutes later it recovered about 25 points to 2228.    Mr. Li brought international attention to Hong Kong --and to himself --when he directed the exchange to close during the October crash. The incident led to a government review of the colony's financial markets. The review is widely seen as the government's first step toward reining in the exchange's 21-member general committee. Dominated by Mr. Li, the committee used to have complete authority over the exchange's management.    Although its review hasn't been completed, the government proposed the suspension of the general committee's powers and the creation of a new management committee to run the exchange. The general committee, in effect, had to vote itself temporarily out of power.    The new panel's members were drawn from the general committee's membership of 21. Seven members were not included, among them Mr. Li and Mr. Sin, the exchange chairman. Of the seven, only Mr. Li is officially under investigation.    Mr. Sin declined to comment.    The new committee, the government made clear, in practice wouldn't have the same sweeping authority that the general committee used to wield. As a result, Mr. Fell has been given a relatively free hand to run the exchange --now as its chief executive --because Mr. Sun, the chief executive who was arrested, had already planned to give up his post later this month and emigrate to Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
