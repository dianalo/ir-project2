While the 28 black employees who brought therace-discrimination suit were awarded $535,000, thesettlement could end up costing the company much more becauseeach of about 4,000 blacks included in the class action willhave an opportunity in individual hearings to seek damagesfor any losses incurred.</LP><TEXT>   If an amount can't be agreed upon, the settlement termsprovide for arbitration. There is no cap in the settlementagreement on how much Northwest ultimately might have to pay.&quot;There is no other settlement that even approaches this insignificance,&quot; said Paul Sprenger, a partner at theWashington, D.C., law firm of Sprenger andamp; Lang, whichrepresented the plaintiffs.   Just how much Northwest will have to pay depends on howmany additional claims are filed and how many are deemedvalid. In previous suits involving other companies, about 25%to 50% of claimants eligible to file claims did so, said JaneLang, Mr. Sprenger's co-counsel.   The settlement combines aspects of past class-actionsettlements with some unique features, said Ms. Lang. In oneelement of the pact, management must file writtenexplanations each time qualified blacks are passed over forpromotions.   Northwest also agreed to establish a career resourcecenter with a $1 million annual budget to identify blacks aspotential candidates for promotion.   The settlement also provides another $275,000 to be usedas training funds to encourage black employees, interns andjob candidates to develop skills in areas in which they havebeen underrepresented. And the airline will spend $1.2million in &quot;mandatory cultural diversity training&quot; forexecutives and supervisors, according to Ms. Lang.   The original suit alleged that Northwest discriminatedagainst blacks in both hiring and promotions nationwide.Northwest, a unit of NWA Inc. based in Minneapolis, deniedunlawful conduct, but said the settlement was a &quot;fair andreasonable resolution&quot; of the allegations.   U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop in Minneapolis, who gavethe settlement preliminary approval yesterday, will hold afinal hearing on its fairness Aug. 16.</TEXT></DOC>
