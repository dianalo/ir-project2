Mr. Bush's aides denied a report in the Saturday New York Post that he told associates at a luncheon meeting that he thought Mr. Regan should resign. &quot;The vice president says he did not say that,&quot; said Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's press secretary.    However, other associates of Mr. Bush confirm that he believes Mr. Regan should go, but contends that to raise the issue with the president would be counterproductive. Mr. Fitzwater said he didn't know whether these associates are correct.    President Reagan reportedly has dug in his heels to remain loyal to his closest aide, who has been one of the most powerful chiefs of staff in recent history because of the president's management style of delegating to his subordinates. Most White House insiders believe that if Mr. Regan does resign as a result of this continued public and private criticism, he will wait until after the holidays.    Mr. Bush, who is expected to seek the presidency in 1988, stands to be damaged politically along with Mr. Reagan by the administration's loss of credibility during the Iran arms-sales affair. Mr. Bush is thus eager to bring the matter to a close, a goal many Reagan advisers have argued would be advanced by replacing the chief of staff. But the vice president could come under fire for failing to press his views with the president.    Mr. Regan, asked yesterday whether he plans to resign, told reporters: &quot;No, absolutely not.&quot; The former Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. chairman added further that &quot;if I'm ineffective or not helping this president, obviously I would resign. But . . . in this case, I don't feel I have any particular culpability.&quot;    In a speech today before an Iowa law-enforcement group, the vice president plans to call on former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and his fired deputy, Lt. Col. Oliver North, to waive their constitutional rights and make public a full accounting of the secret diversion of profits from Iranian arms purchases to the Nicaraguan insurgents known as the Contras.    This is part of an effort by White House officials to focus attention on the two departed national security aides as the roadblock to resolving the crisis, thus allowing the president to remain above the fray.    Such a plea by First Lady Nancy Reagan in interviews Wednesday failed to move Lt. Col. North, who told reporters yesterday: &quot;I don't believe the president really wants me to abandon my individual rights under the Constitution. People have died face down in the mud all over the world defending those individual rights.&quot;    White House officials believe that Mr. Reagan cannot personally ask Messrs. Poindexter and North to waive their rights to avoid self-incrimination.    &quot;The president is obviously in a bind,&quot; concludes one senior aide. &quot;If he intrudes too much in the investigative process, it looks like interference. If he does nothing, it looks like he's stonewalling. But if he goes out front without really knowing all the facts, he could look like a bumbler, out of touch with his own administration.&quot;    Mr. Reagan, in a letter to the Senate leadership this week, asked that the Intelligence Committee issue to him a report on the Iran-Contra program, which he then would make public. The panel's chairman, Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.), said the committee would &quot;make every effort to be responsive&quot; to Mr. Reagan's request.    Efforts to focus the issue on Messrs. Poindexter and North extended yesterday even to the Interior Department. A tape-recorded report for radio newscasters featured a statement from Secretary Donald Hodel charging that those who oppose immunity for the two aides are doing it for partisan political gain. </TEXT></DOC>
