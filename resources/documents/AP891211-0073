Communists have been slow in realizing the ``historic exhaustionof the single-party system,'' Stanko Stojicevic, head of theCroatian Communist Party's ruling presidium, said at the opening ofa regional party congress in the Croatian capital of Zagreb.   ``There can be no democratic socialism without politicalpluralism based on the right of association and competition ofpolitical (movements) and programs,'' Stojicevic said in hiskeynote speech carried by the state Tanjug news agency.   Until now the liberal northern state of Slovenia was the onlyone of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics to openly advocatethe introduction of Western-style democracy.   About a dozen independent movements and parties have been set upin Slovenia over the past year, and the region plans to hold itsfirst free legislative elections next March.   On Sunday some 25,000 people in several Croatian cities signed apetition urging legalization of numerous parties that would makepossible the holding of free elections in the republic borderingSlovenia in the West.   ``We consider that (Yugoslavia's new constitution) shouldprovide for a political system that will include ... parties andmovements representing the political interests of citizens,'' saidStojicevic, according to a report broadcast by Zagreb radio.   Croatia and some other republics have in the past beennon-committal about multiparty democracy, which is vehementlyopposed by the Communist leadership of the country's largest stateof Serbia.   Earlier this month Serbia, in an apparent move to stifleburgeoning democratic trends in the country, severed all businessand official ties with Slovenia. The unprecedented action shook thefoundations of Yugoslavia's loose federal system.   Stojicevic sharply denounced Serbia's break with Slovenia,describing the consequences as ``dramatic with a possiblycatastrophic outcome.''   ``Ultimatums and the severance of economic relations,accusations and threats represent a direct attack on theconstitutional order of the country and its economic and politicalintegrity,'' Stojicevic said.   Slovenia's parliament met today to discuss Serbia's actions,which Slovenian president Janez Stanovik said were a ``heavy blowto the Yugoslav federation.''   He said Serbia was trying to ``eliminate all those who holddiffering opinions and to produce a change of the constitutionalorder.''   ``The blockade of Slovenia, therefore, represents an act ofaggression against Yugoslavia,'' he told lawmakers.   Croatia's state leadership, which had earlier sought to remainon the sidelines of the dispute between Serbia and Slovenia, cameout strongly last week in favor of Slovenia.   Croats and Serbs are traditional arch-rivals in Yugoslavia'spatchwork of nationalities, and an open clash between the tworegions could seriously threaten the unity of this Balkan nation.   Yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite itsone-party system.   But political, economic, social and ethnic problems havemushroomed since the death in 1980 of President Josip Broz Tito,whose charisma was seen as a major force in bounding together thedivergent ethnic groups in the country.</TEXT></DOC>
