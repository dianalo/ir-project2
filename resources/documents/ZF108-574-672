(DCA) last week introduced a newfamily of hardware that adheres to the forthcoming 10BaseT standard forrunning Ethernet over telephone wiring.andM;The new 10Base Twisted-Pair product line, announced at PC Expo here, includesan AT-bus adapter, a concentrator and a transceiver that work with networksrunning DCA's 10Net LAN operating system, Novell Inc.'s NetWare 286 orMicrosoft Corp.'s LAN Manager.andM;The company also announced plans to unbundle its 10Net hardware and softwareto give users more options for mixing 10Net and other vendors' LAN products.andM;DCA officials said the new hardware is designed to tap the potential of10BaseT technology, which provides 10M-bps transmission across widelyinstalled and relatively inexpensive unshielded twisted-pair wiring.andM;&quot;There's a major growth opportunity in this market,&quot; said Greg Goodall, vicepresident and general manager of DCA's 10Net Communications division, basedin Dayton, Ohio.andM;The 10Base Twisted-Pair Adapter, which DCA has tested for use with wiringhubs from SynOptics Inc. and Cabletron Systems Inc., is priced at $425.andP;  Itincludes an Intel 82586 LAN controller and a 32K-byte dual-port RAM buffer toincrease performance by off-loading tasks from the main CPU, said Ken Davis,10Net's director of marketing.andM;The new 10Base Twisted-Pair Concentrator includes a fiber-optic port,allowing users to connect twisted-pair, coaxial and fiber-optic media in asingle unit.andP;  The $2,200 concentrator connects as many as 10 PCs; multipleconcentrators can be used to link as many as 1,000 PCs, Davis said.andM;The third hardware offering, the 10Base Twisted-Pair Transceiver, is a $195unit that plugs into any third-party Ethernet adapter and features five LEDsfor monitoring network status.andM;Plug and PlayandM;&quot;The new 10Net products are very inexpensive, and you can just plug and playwith your existing system,&quot; said Robert Turcotte, manager of the microinformation center at Raytheon Co., a defense contractor in Lexington, Mass.,andO;that has a large 10Net network.andM;The new 10Base hardware is available now.andP;  DCA has devised a new packagingand licensing program under which the 10Net software is priced separatelyfrom the hardware.andM;The base 10Net system software, documentation and license now costs $149;workstation packages range from $349 for a three-user version to $5,000 for100 users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
