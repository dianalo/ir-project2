While the heady stock sales are healthy for the nation'syoung, capital-hungry biotechnology industry, seasonedbiotech investors caution that they can be hazardous forlong-term buyers.</LP><TEXT>   This fall's crop of second-time sellers of stock includesa crowd that had a tough sale in the spring when they wentpublic for the first time. Then they fell prey to a chillthat descended on biotech offerings after the stock ofRegeneron Pharmaceuticals plummeted to half its offeringprice. Companies such as MedImmune, COR Therapeutics,Alkermes, Glycomed and Isis Pharmaceuticals, which settledthen for raising less money than they wanted, are now findingit easier to sell stock again -- and at much higher prices --in the current biotech feeding frenzy.   COR Therapeutics, for example, sold stock in an initialpublic offering in late June at $7.50 a share. Late lastmonth, it sold more stock, this time at a whopping $18.25 ashare. Yet COR, which is developing a product aimed atpreventing heart disease, isn't expected to break even --much less be profitable -- before 1996.   Companies with AIDS-related products in development arewildly popular. Shares of MedImmune, a small Gaithersburg,Md., company that went public in May at $9.25 a share, hadsoared to $50.50 by Thursday -- when the company said itplans to sell 2.5 million more shares. In a telling sign, twomillion of those shares are being sold by insiders -- venturecapital companies that originally backed the developer ofAIDS-related products.   &quot;Sure it's fast,&quot; concedes Michael Gordon of the FidelitySelect Biotechnology Fund of Boston, referring to somebiotech companies' speedy return to the equity market. &quot;Butthe market's strong. They might as well make hay while thesun shines.&quot;   Big investors don't fault the fast-growing, cash-starvedyoung industry from selling stock at such high prices, evenif these institutions are wary of buying the shares. Thematuring biotech industry has several things going for itthat it didn't during previous buying frenzies that latercollapsed.   Biotech companies &quot;are lucky they're hitting the publicfinancing market just when their big brothers {such as Amgen}are making piles of money,&quot; says Cheryl Alexander of Putnam'sHealth Sciences Trust of Boston. Amgen's anemia-fighting drugEpogen, for example, proved that genetically engineered drugscan be blockbusters. Companies such as Amgen, Immunex andCentoxin are getting far higher prices for their rare drugsthan expected. And regulators are moving more quickly toapprove drugs that treat fatal diseases such as AIDS.   The latest flurry of stock sales &quot;is a very appropriatestrategy,&quot; says Edward Owens of the Vanguard SpecializedHealth Care Portolio. &quot;It's very good for our country to putthis money in the pockets of good scientists, free them fromgovernment grants, and let them research their hearts out.&quot;Competitively, &quot;it will give us a better chance than Japanand Europe in developing the future,&quot; he adds.   But Mr. Owens, for one, isn't nibbling at the second roundof stock sales by this year's newly public biotech companies.&quot;I think some of the managements that saw me twice arewondering what in the world is this guy doing?&quot; he says. &quot;ButI'm building a base for later.&quot;   A biotech investor since the early 1980s, Mr. Owens hasfound that if he just waits, he can buy the shares of manyembryonic companies long after the initial enthusiasm hasdied and the stocks are much cheaper. He suspects thatsophisticated investors are quickly selling the fast-risingstocks to more naive investors who aren't aware of theperilous road ahead for many drug developers. &quot;I thinkthere's a lot of uninformed buying right now,&quot; he says.   Putnam's Ms. Alexander, for example, &quot;flipped&quot; CORTherapeutics when the company sold stock for the second timeat $18.25 each. She bought new COR shares, then sold themquickly for a quick profit as the stock rose as high as $22 ashare a few days later, before easing.   &quot;We're doing a lot of those now, flipping them,&quot; Ms.Alexander says. &quot;It's free money.&quot; She questions the wisdomof investors who expect the stocks to continue rising, asmany of the companies aren't expected to be profitable forfive or six years -- and some may never be. &quot;There will be abear market between now and 1997,&quot; she adds wryly. Ms.Alexander has been spreading her risk by buying more sharesof such huge drug companies as Abbott Laboratories andJohnson andamp; Johnson, whose stocks have lagged shares of thesmaller biotech companies.   Fidelity's Mr. Gordon is limited to biotech investments byhis fund's mandate, but still finds ways to safeguard hisgains. Mr. Gordon bought during some of second round of stocksales by young biotech companies, but he also owns a hugebasket of other biotech stocks -- including many seasonedcompanies such as Amgen. As for the little, untestedcompanies, he says: &quot;I look at my investment in early-stagecompanies like these as a fluid process. If they go down,I'll average down my costs if I continue to like thelong-term story.&quot;   Selectivity is important to John Kaweske of Denver'sFinancial Funds, who sticks with companies that have productsthat are already being tested on humans. Still, he plans topare his biotech holdings to 15% of his health-care fund from17%. And he is also beefing up his holdings in big drugstocks to 30%.   Of course, there are also skeptics who urge investors tosell the young new crop of companies short, that is, borrowshares and sell them with the hope of profiting by replacingthem later at a lower price. &quot;Not a single one of those{companies} has earned a penny, and they may never earn anymoney,&quot; says Charles Allmon, publisher of the Growth StockOutlook newsletter of Chevy Chase, Md. &quot;I'd suggest you shortthe whole list.&quot;   And Jim McCamant, publisher of the Medical TechnologyStock Letter, recalls that even hugely successful Amgen fellto less than one-quarter of its initial offering price just17 months after its 1983 debut in the public market.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks charged to another record in anarrow rally led by technology and biotechnology shares.
