With growth in manufacturing employment outweighing smaller-than-usual Christmas hiring among retailers, total non-farm payrolls last month rose by about 274,000, or 0.3%, to 103.2 million.    The Labor Department figures offer no hint of an economic downturn. &quot;It's a very strong report,&quot; said Robert Wescott, vice president, Alphametrics Corp., Bala Cynwyd, Pa. &quot;It's starting to make the doomsayers' position recede, the people who on Oct. 20 were saying a recession's coming.&quot;    But James Cochrane, chief economist for Texas Commerce Bankshares Inc., Houston, said that even companies with strong fourth-quarter business are nervous about next year. &quot;We find our customers who formulated business plans are not taking action,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a paradox: A very strong economy in the fourth quarter and . . . uncertainty about consumer spending and new investment next year,&quot; he added.    The decline in the jobless rate for the civilian work force occurred despite higher unemployment rates among blacks and Hispanics, the Labor Department said. Among blacks, the unemployment rate was 12.1%, up from 12%; among Hispanics it was 9.1%, up from 8.3%, and among whites it was 5.1%, down from 5.2%. The overall 5.9% unemployment rate in November is sharply lower than the 6.9% rate in November 1986.    A measure that counts military personnel among the employed declined to 5.8% from 5.9% in October.    All the figures are adjusted for normal seasonal variation.    The 274,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in November follows a revised increase in October of 536,000. Previously, the Labor Department put the October increase at 549,000, and some economists said they were pleasantly surprised that the revision was so small.    Payrolls in service industries -- the retailers, financial institutions, governments, hospitals and utilities that employ three-quarters of American workers -- rose by 175,000, or 0.2%, in November after climbing by 400,000 in October.    Retail employment, seasonally adjusted, slipped by 20,000, or 0.1%, after rising 82,000 in October. &quot;The November weakness resulted from smaller-than-usual job increases in department stores,&quot; said Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.    Payrolls in the finance, real estate and insurance industries grew 15,000, or 0.2%, in November despite Black Monday. Ms. Norwood said this suggests that &quot;the difficulties faced by the financial securities industry haven't yet affected our employment measure.&quot; Other economists noted, however, that the November increase was below the gains reported earlier in the year.    Manufacturing employment, which accounts for about 19% of all non-farm employment, was strong, rising 69,000 in November after an increase of 76,000 in October. Hiring was widespread among different industries.    &quot;We've got a miniboom going on in exports,&quot; said Mr. Wescott of Alphametrics. The slide in the value of the dollar makes American goods cheaper to foreign customers, and that has been boosting sales overseas.    The length of the average workweek for manufacturing workers continued to be long, although it fell by 0.1 hour to 41.2 hours. The October figure was the highest in 21 years.    The index of hourly earnings, which excludes the effects of overtime pay and shift differentials, rose to 175.7% of the 1977 average from 174.8% in October. That increase exceeds 6% at an annual rate. Average hourly earnings rose to $9.12 from $9.09 in October.    The statistics describe an economy so strong that some economists began talking again about a resurgence in inflation, a worry that was widespread before the stock market crash.    &quot;There was an inflation red flag,&quot; said Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York. &quot;With unemployment close to full employment and labor shortgages in many areas, it's not surprising to see higher wages, but 6% is a high rate,&quot; he added, and warned that renewed fears of inflation could push interest rates up.    The Labor Department figures on payrolls come from its survey of employers. Its survey of households, which is used to compute the unemployment rate, showed that total employment rose to 115.3 million in November, up 327,000 from the month before. The total labor force -- those working or seeking work -- climbed 269,000 to 122.4 million.    Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report.
