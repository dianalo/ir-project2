Security Council tentatively agreedon a draft working paper calling for an arms embargo of Iran,sources said Friday.   The diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,called the draft a significant step toward an embargo sought by theUnited States and other Western nations.   Both Iran and Iraq, at war since September 1980, depend on armsimports.   The Soviet Union and China have been reluctant to implement anembargo before further diplomatic efforts by U.N Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar.   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz is expected to discussthe proposed embargo when he goes to Moscow on Sunday.   The sources said the draft resolution may be the subject of longnegotiations before the 15 council members come to any agreement.   ``It is a `nonpaper' on which the five will continue to work andon which the opinions of the other 10 members are welcome,'' onesource said.   The sources said the council was expected to discuss whether toidentify Iran by name and whether to mention an international navalpeacekeeping force in the Persian Gulf, as proposed by the SovietUnion.   The sources said the ``big five'' agreed Thursday on the workingpaper calling for an arms embargo against Iran. The paper wasdistributed Friday to the other 10 council members, the sourcessaid.   The five permanent members are the United States, Britain,China, France and the Soviet Union. The other 10 are Algeria,Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal, West Germany, Senegal,Yugoslavia and Zambia.   The United States is president of the Security Council thismonth.   The specific contents of the working paper were not known, butit was based on a British proposal for a two-year arms embargoagainst Iran unless that country makes peace with Iraq.   The British proposal would have the Security Council order allnations to stop supplying war materiel and military training toIran and cancel military contracts.   On July 20 the Security Council adopted Resolution 598,demanding an immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, a troopwithdrawal, prisoner exchange and other measures. It also calledfor enforcement steps if either party did not comply.   Iraq has said it accepts the resolution as written. But Iran hassought to rearrange various elements in it and to brand Iraq theaggressor.   Despite the secretary-general's consultations with both sidesand his mission to the gulf in September, the Security Councilinitiative has foundered.   The Soviet Union and other nations that seek better ties withIran have been reluctant to push for punitive enforcement and tooffend the Tehran government.   The United States, the Soviet Union and several European nationshave naval fleets in the Persian Gulf to protect their shippingfrom attacks related to the war.   Iran raids third-country ships to retaliate for Iraqi attacks onits oil targets. Iran focuses its raids on ships linked to Kuwaitor other gulf Arab countries that it accuses of aiding iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
