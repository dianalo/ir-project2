That Power Allocation was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 19032) dated March 24, 1980. By letterdated January 24, 1984, President Reagan set forth a method of action whichrequires Federal agencies to negotiate reasonable non-Federal funding priorto the start of construction for new Federal hydroelectric power projects(new Federal projects). The 1980 SWPA Power Allocation does not addressthe allocation of new power from construction of new Federal projects withfunds advanced by non-Federal entities. As a result of these changing conditions,SWPA believed a policy was needed to address the allocation of new powerthat may become available for marketing from existing and new, Federallyand non-Federally funded, hydroelectric power projects. SWPA publishedthe Power Allocation Policy (Policy) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> August 12, 1987 (52 FR 29881).Section I, Paragraph 3 of the Policy announced ``New customers shall beselected in accordance with SWPA's New Customer Selection Policy.'' ThePolicy provided ten percent of any power available for allocation wouldbe allocated to new customers. SWPA has received many formal and informalrequests from applicants for allocations of power and energy from the SWPAhydroelectric power system. Therefore, in accordance with the above, SWPAhas developed a Proposed New Customer Selection Policy. The Proposed NewCustomer Selection Policy should not be confused with the selection procedureand criteria for non-Federal entities (sponsors) willing to provide fundingprior to the start of construction for new Federal hydroelectric powerprojects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on the proposed policy must be submitted on orbefore August 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments may be mailed to: Francis R.

Gajan, Director ofPower Marketing (918) 581-7529.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Proposed New Customer SelectionPolicy addresses the criteria and procedures SWPA proposes to use in selectingnew customers when Federal hydroelectric power is available for allocation.This policy is a separate procedure from the selection of a non-Federalsponsor to participate financially in the development of a Federal hydroelectricpower project. An entity applying to be a new customer of SWPA could alsobe a non-Federal sponsor for a project. Allocations will be made to newcustomers and non-Federal sponsors according to the SWPA Power AllocationPolicy in effect at the time of the allocation.SWPA published a Notice of Intent to Develop Policy for New Customer Selectionin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 10, 1987 (52 FR 4186). In the noticeSWPA requested that interested parties provide comments and suggestionsto SWPA by March 12, 1987, concerning the formulation of the policy. Twelveletters were received in response to the Notice of Intent. Summaries ofthe comments received concerning the development of a New Customer SelectionPolicy and SWPA's responses follow:1. <T3>Comment</T3>_A new customer selected to receive power and energy fromthe Federal hydroelectric power system should be a preference customeras intended by section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, as amended.<T3>SWPA Response</T3>_SWPA agrees. Preference will be given in selectingnew customers as required by section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944,as amended.2. <T3>Comment</T3>_A proposed policy should be prepared and published forcomments.<T3>SWPA Response</T3>_SWPA agrees.3. <T3>Comment</T3>_Existing power allocations should remain in effect andexisting power sales contracts should be satisfied before new preferencecustomers are given an allocation.<T3>SWPA Response</T3>_The 1980 power allocations were made using knownexisting and future resources and those allocations will remain in effectaccording to the 1980 Final Power Allocations. Power sales contracts relatedto the 1980 power allocations will be satisfied when the existing and futureresources referred to therein are available. Any new allocations and relatedpower sales agreements will be made in accordance with the allocation policyin effect at the time power becomes available for allocation.4. <T3>Comment</T3>_Selection of public bodies and municipalities that havethe ability to be served easily and economically through municipal jointaction agencies would provide the most widespread benefits of Federal hydroelectricpower generation.<T3>SWPA Response</T3>_SWPA recognizes the economic benefits inherent tosuch a concept. Although SWPA has considered development of new customerselection based on the concept, SWPA believes that it is more equitableto select new customers individually on a first requested_first servedbasis.5. <T3>Comment</T3>_For the purpose of establishing a priority listing ofrecipient customers, first consideration should be given to Federal agencieswith authorizing legislation entitling them to project power where thereare definite impacts from water development projects. Secondly, Federalinstallations within the boundaries of the generating facility should receivepreference power for any energy excess to the needs for which the originalplant was designed.<T3>SWPA Response</T3>_SWPA, as authorized by section 5 of the Flood ControlAct of 1944 (as amended), markets only that power and energy which is determined(in accordance with the authorizing legislation) to be excess to projectrequirements (general station service). Specific authorizing legislationwould be required for a Federal agency, other than the construction agency,to receive station service power from an existing or newly constructedproject.Absent such legislation, the allocation (to a Federal agency) of ``excess''Federal power and energy which may become available for marketing by SWPAwould be made in accordance with the power allocation policy then in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Southwestern Power Administration Proposed New Customer SelectionPolicy </ITAG>The Administrator shall select new customers (applicants) requesting apower allocation on a first requested-first served basis and based on thefollowing criteria: 1.
