 Thisarticle presents the history, the motivation, and an overview of the featuresand major components of the NewWave environment.andP;  The other NewWave articlesin this issue discuss the components of the NewWave architecture in detail.andM;To understand the NewWave environment it is helpful to review the backgroundfor HP's decision to invest in this product.andP;  HP has been producing officesystems software since the late 1970s.andP;  Some early products include theDesign Systems Graphics package (DSG) and the HP Word word processingpackage, both of which run on HP 3000 Computers.andP;  In personal computersoftware, the CP/M [R] -based HP 125 Business software solutions, including1982, had a number of business software solutions, including word processing,a spreadsheet application, and a presentation graphics package.andM;The release of HP DeskManager for HP 3000 Computers in 1982 marked HP's firstproduct that addressed the need for integrating these office systems softwareproducts.andP;  HP DeskManager was originally designed as a simple electronic mailproduct, [1] allowing users to send and receive messages easily across anetwork of HP 3000 Computers.andP;  It was very clear that our customers neededmore than electronic mail functions from HP DeskManager.andP;  They needed to beable to compose arbitrary packages of information into messages and to filethose messages for later retrieval.andP;  The introduction of new software on theHP 3000 and on our personal computers meant that we needed to integrate theproducts mentioned above with HP DeskManager.andP;  At the very least, usersshould be able to create and read an HP Word document within the HPDeskmanager environment without leaving the product.andP;  Over the years HP hasinvested very heavily in HP DeskManager, evolving it into a true integratedoffice system.andP;  It has a wide range of features and acts as the center of ourHP 3000-based office solutions with close links to the personal computer.andM;To enable users to connect their personal computers to the HP 3000, HPdeveloped the Personal Productivity Center range of products.andP;  For the HP3000 Computer these products include HP DeskManager, HP File/Library, HPSchedule, and Resource Sharing.andP;  For PC users these products include softwarepackages for eletronic mail, terminal emulation, word processing, datamanagement, spread-sheets, and graphics.andM;There are a number of architectural limitations in the current products thatprevented us from creating the truly integrated and powerful system ourcustomers need.andP;  The products that we have available were designed indifferent HP devisions and by outside companies to meet the needs of theirparticular markets.andP;  This resulted in software applications that did not havethe same basic architecture.andM;An investigation of potential solutions to the problem of integrating ourproducts began with the knowledge that the solution developed must have thefollowing fundamental characteristics:andM;* It must be practical.andP;  The solution must work well on existing hardware andadd value to existing software so that customer investments are protected.andM;* It must be flexible and extendable.andP;  The software field is expandingrapidly and opportunities will exist tomorrow that could not have beendreamed of when the system was designed.andP;  This includes portability acrossdifferent hardware platforms.andM;* It must allow for the efficient development of systems.andP;  Softwarecomponents must be available for reuse according to the maxim that if afunction is used several times in a system it should be provided as a systemservice for use by all components.andM;* It must have a sufficient advantage over existing systems that customersand software developers will make the investment necessary to use the newsystem.andM;* It must allow us to build easy-to-learn and easy-to-use software.andP;  Users donot want to spend weeks or months learning to use software, and once they areproficient with the software, they do not want to be hampered by aninflexible system.andM;* It must be an open system.andP;  HP could not hope to offer proprietarysolutions in all areas.andP;  Customers would want to take a advantage of ourarchitecture.andP;  Designing an open system from the start would allow many moresolutions than we alone could provide.andM;* It must run on existing hardware such as the HP Vectra and the IBM PC/AT.andM;This is a formidable list of objectives.andP;  The NewWave environment is designedto meet these objectives, and exceed them wherever possible.andM;Open and Extendable ArchitectureandM;The newWave environment was originally designed as a proprietary environmentfor the development of better integrated office systems.andP;  However, asprototypes of the system became available and were demonstrated, it becameclear that the system had great appeal to a wider audience than the internalHP community.andP;  Major accounts and independent software vendors (ISVs) allwanted to learn how to write NewWave applications.andP;  They wanted to takeadvantage of our object-based file system and applications, while addressingareas of the market that were their specialty.andM;We decided to open up the NewWave architecture.andP;  This entailed:andM;* Ensuring that our interfaces were made general and robustandM;* Providing documentation, training, and support suitable for softwaredevelopersandM;* Doing extensive testing of the programmatic interfaces in differentsoftware and hardware environments.andM;The NewWave environment will be used by a wide variety of customers, all withdifferent needs, and we know that our customers developing applications torun in the NewWave environment will expect us to keep up with newtechnologies.andM;Based on the Microsoft [R] Windows interface (see Fig.andP;  1), the NewWaveenvironment is well positioned for IBM's OS/2 operating system and thePresentation Manager system from IBM and Microsoft.andP;  We are also working onimplementing the NewWave environment under the HP-UX operating system.andP;  Thus,the NewWave environment provides software developers with the advantage of asystem that is portable across a range of platforms.andM;The NewWave environments is extendable to incorporate new softwaretechniques.andP;  For example, the agent facility, which is a major component inthe NewWave architecture, is designed to include the functionality and powerof artificial intelligence.andP;  Future applications, such as natural languagesystems, can be integrated with NewWave applications that use the agentfacility without any impact on the application.andM;The System ApproachandM;From the beginning the NewWave environment has been designed as an integratedsoftware system.andP;  This is in contrast to previous systems, which weredesigned piecemeal, with integration added later.andP;  The major components ofthe NewWave architecture are shown in Fig.andP;  2.andP;  Taken together, thesecomponents offer software developers and users a number of benefits,including:andM;* Consistency.andP;  NewWave applications have a consistent user interface, basedupon Microsoft Windows.andP;  HP provides user interface rules that are anextension of those provided by Microsoft to ensure that NewWave applicationshave a common look and feel.andP;  Common data formats adopted by NewWaveapplications ensure that information generated in one area can be understoodin another, even if it is on a different machine in another location.andM;* Automation and Training.andP;  The agent facility provides task automationacross all applications in the NewWave environment.andP;  The agent can be thoughtof as a personal assistant that can perform tasks on behalf of the user.andO;Computer-based training (CBT) is implemented in the NewWave environment usingthe facilities provided by the agent.andP;  The NEwWave environment provides thetools for developers to use the agent and to built CBT into their products.andO;The agent is described in the articles: &quot;An Extensible Agent Task Language&quot;and &quot;Agents and the HP NewWave Application Program Interface&quot; on pages 38 and32 respectively, and computer-based training is duscussed in the article&quot;NewWave Computer-Based Training Development Facility&quot; on page 48.andM;* Developer Productivity.andP;  The NewWave environment handles many of the tasksthat developers would have to design and implement individually if they werewriting applications outside of the NewWave environment.andP;  An example of thisis the NewWave help facility.andP;  NewWave help is available to all NewWaveapplications and provides a powerful context sensitive help capability in allareas of the system.andP;  The help facility is described in the article &quot;The HPNewWave Environment Help Facility&quot; on page 43.andM;* Integration.andP;  the NewWave object management facility (OMF) providesstandardized data object management for all NewWave applications.andP;  The OMFincludes facilities to define and install specific classes of objects, suchas text, graphics, image, or voice, and the links between them.andP;  For example,a text object can incorporate an arbitrary number of other objects to producea compound document.andP;  The OMF manages the links so that the object can bemanipulated as a whole when it is copied, deleted, or mailed over thenetwork.andP;  The OMF also supports data-passing links so that, for example, aspreadsheet object can obtain data from a data base and in turn link thatdata into a document or a line chart.andP;  These facilities are all supported atthe system level and thus are available to all NewWave applications.andP;  The OMFis described in the article &quot;The NewWave Object Management Facility&quot; on page17.andM;* Ease of Learning.andP;  A major objective of the NewWave environment is toensure that if users learn a technique in one area, they will be able toapply the same techniques in another area, even if the application is notsupplied by HP.andP;  The computer-based training tools are available to alldevelopers so that they can build these powerful learning aids into theirproducts.andM;* Ease of Use.andP;  The NewWave environment is designed to be substantiallyeasier to use than previous systems.andP;  We selected an interface based upondirect manipulation of icons that represent NewWave objects (e.g., filedrawers, folders, printers, etc.).andP;  From the user's perspective theNewWaveOffice window provides an easy-to-use facility for organizing, filing,retrieving, and deleting objects as necessary.andP;  The NewWave Office is theprimary interface between the user and the NewWave environment, and it is thefirst display seen by the user when the environment is loaded.andP;  The NewWaveOffice allows users to focus on the tasks that they need to perform ratherthan the tools they use.andP;  See the article &quot;The NewWave Office&quot; on page 23 formore details.andM;* Integration with MS-DOS  Applications.andP;  The NewWave environment offers aset of facilities tat enable MS-DOS applications to be used within thesystem.andP;  At the simplest level users can access non-NewWave applications fromthe NewWave Office window and return to the NewWave Office when they havecompleted their task.andP;  The data from non-NeWave programs can also appear asobjects in the OMF.andP;  HP provides facilities to encapsulate non-NewWaveapplications within a shell that allows them to share some of the NewWaveenvironment advantages such as data linking and background printing.andO;Integration with MS-DOS applications is described in the article&quot;Encapsulation of Applications in the NewWave Environment&quot; on page 57.andM;Supported Hardware PlatformsandM;The initial relese of the HP NewWave environment is designed to run on anyIntel 80286 or 80386-based personal computer that supports Microsoft Windows.andO;The primary platform is the HP Vectra range of personal computers.andP;  However,the NewWave environment is also supported on the IBM PC/AT and IBM OS/2series and HP Vectra PC compatibles.andP;  The NewWave environment supports allhardware peripherals supported by Microsoft Windows, including HP LaserJetprinters, HP plotters, and the HP ScanJet image scanner.andM;HP has developed an expanded memory card [2] for the HP Vectra ES PersonalComputer that delivers substantial performance improvements withoutcompromising the industry-standard compatibility of the software using it.andO;One of the objectives of this card is to enhance the performance ofapplications using Microsoft Windows, such as the NewWave environment.andM;The NewWave environment connects to networks using the HP AdvanceNet datacommunications software and hardware.andP;  Users have te choice of serial or HPThinLAN or StarLAN connections to a local area network that may include otherpersonal computers and an HP 3000 Computer system.andP;  Software developers canbuild distributed applications using the networking tools that HP provides,such as NetIPC interprocess communication software, the Cooperative Serviceslibrary, and Resource Sharing.andM;ConclusionandM;The HP NewWave environment is an important step for HP in its strategy ofgiving computer users a powerful software environment that allows them easieraccess to information wherever it is stored on the computer network.andP;  For thefirst time we are able to produce a system built on a common architecture,rather than a collection of individual products.andP;  The NewWave environmentthat is available today is the beginning of a trend in software system designthat will eventually give the benefits of NewWave to the entire spectrum ofinformation workers.andM;ReferenceandM;[1].andP;
