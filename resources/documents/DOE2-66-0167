Storage ofassociated natural gas in geological formations, not utilizable directlyand at present still being flared, allows considerable amounts of energyand raw materials to be obtained for the future. The geological preconditionsfor utilizing aquifer structures for the long-term storage of large amountsof gas and some differences to aquifer storage as practised hithertoare being discussed. On the basis of exploration results obtained sofar, orienting calculations concerning the storage capacity and storageperformance as well as concerning the gas-water displacement are madefor an aquifer structure in the Middle East. Conducting detailed site-relatedinvestigations on the storage of associated natural gas in hydrocarbondeposits and in aquifer structures is recommended, with the developmentsin the gas industries to be expected having to be kept in mind.</TEXT></DOC>
