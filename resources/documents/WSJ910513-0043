The White House now is pushing technology programs inCongress that would subsidize makers of supercomputers,software and electric cars. It is also planning expensive newinitiatives for the biotechnology and materials-processingindustries, and selecting other commercial technologies forspecial attention.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's an industrial policy; it's just disguised,&quot; saysEdward Miller, president of the National Center forManufacturing Sciences, a manufacturing group in Ann Arbor,Mich.   Just 18 months ago, efforts to single out technologies forspecial favor were cause for dismissal in the Bushadministration. The Pentagon last year fired technologistCraig Fields, while Deputy Commerce Secretary Thomas Murrinwas squeezed out for pushing industrial-policy programs tooforcefully. The administration also tried to kill researchprograms in next-generation television and semiconductors.   The change in the White House since then reflects pressurefrom business groups and Congress to increase funding forcommercial technologies, and concern that the U.S. is losingtrade battles with Japan and Europe. But it also reflects anattempt by White House officials to find a way to makeinvestments in commercial research and developmentpolitically correct.   Technologies that require years of work before they canproduce commercial products are all right for federalinvestment because they're too risky for industry, says AllanBromley, the president's science adviser. But technologiesthat are ready for commercialization are taboo, he says,because the government would have to enter the market and&quot;second-guess who's going to succeed or not.&quot;   In practice, though, the line between what's acceptableideologically and what isn't is faint, if not invisible. Thatvagueness allows the administration to stick to itsfree-market rhetoric, critics say, while starting to endorsesome of the industrialpolicy programs of its opponents. &quot;Theadministration is schizophrenic on the whole issue,&quot; saysSen. Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who heads theDefense Industry and Technology subcommittee.   Robert White the Commerce Department's undersecretary oftechnology, who along with Mr. Bromley favors big increasesin commercial technology, phrases it more delicately: &quot;We'refinding what the administration's philosophical position is,and what we can do within that approach.&quot;   For starters, the administration wants $92 million in thefiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to launch work on asupercomputer network originally championed by DemocraticSen. Albert Gore of Tenn. Administration officials comparethe network to a highway -- no industrial policy there. Butthey privately acknowledge that the network will subsidizesuch supercomputer makers as Cray Research Inc. and ThinkingMachines Corp., whose machines will be at the heart of thenetwork. &quot;We're not against research that at the end of theday helps a broad range of companies,&quot; says a White Houseeconomic official.   The White House also is asking for $36 million for aCommerce Department program in advanced technology that waslaunched under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. The CommerceDepartment says the program funds only &quot;pre-competitive,generic technologies&quot; -- the administration's favorite buzzwords to describe politically correct Randamp;D. But the programfeatures projects in high-definition TV, semiconductors andmanufacturing that are nearly identical to Pentagon projectsthe administration says cross the line into industrial policyand should be killed. (Congress is almost certain to restorefunding for the Pentagon programs.)   &quot;I go along with `pre-competitive' and `generic' becauseI've been told a program is dead-on-arrival if it mentions`industrial policy,&quot;' says Mr. Miller, whose group has wongrants from the Commerce and Defense departments.   So far the amounts the administration has committed to newindustrial-policy initiatives are small, and it has held faston some prohibitions. It won't approve plans that call forlow-interest loans for particular industries, say technologyofficials in and out of government, and it won't back plansto revive the consumer-electronics industry, fearing endlesssubsidies. But the rest is up for grabs.   Recently, the White House's science office put together areport naming 22 technologies as crucial for economicprosperity -- a clear example of trying to pick technologicalwinners. Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of EconomicAdvisers, and Budget Chief Richard Darman tried to distancethe White House from the study, administration officials say,by adding a sentence disclaiming White House responsibilityfor the report.   Early in the administration, that single sentence wouldhave been a kiss of death. But with the easing of ideologicalpressures, Mr. Bromley and Commerce's Mr. White say theystill plan to use the report to decide how best to allocatefederal research funds.   In addition, Mr. Bromley says -- and White House economicofficials confirmthat he has won Mr. Darman's approval to mapout costly new programs to aid the biotechnology and thematerials-processing industries. If finally adopted, theadministration will highlight these projects in the budgetfor the year beginning Oct. 1, 1992, says Mr. Bromley.   Mr. Bromley, a former Yale nuclear physicist who is afriend of the president, has played a big role in shiftingthe administration's attitude toward commercial technology.He formulated the policy of favoring &quot;pre-competitive,generic technology&quot; that guides the administration'stechnology investments, and has put together interagencygroups to find areas that need funding.   He also has often been able to recruit Mr. Darman, alongtime technology buff, as an ally. The budget chief is abig booster of plans in the fiscal 1992 budget, for instance,for improving batteries used in electric cars and forresearching the practicality of magnetically levitatedtrains. &quot;Bromley has legitimized the debate&quot; over commercialRandamp;D, says Erich Bloch, who headed the National ScienceFoundation under Presidents Reagan and Bush.   Research groups already want to cash in on the new WhiteHouse attitude. Sematech, a semiconductor-manufacturingconsortium in Austin, Texas, that once promised it wouldn'tseek federal funds after fiscal 1992, now says it will seek$100 million a year indefinitely. The National AdvisoryCommittee on Semiconductors, a federal semiconductor panelonce ignored by the administration, convinced Mr. Bromley'soffice to co-sponsor a conference to draw up plans foranother costly semiconductor project.   Robert Costello, the Pentagon's acquisition chief underPresident Reagan, says Commerce and Defense departmentofficials are even helping him devise a plan to transform theCommerce Department into the Department of Science, Industryand Trade. He sees the new department as a hotbed ofindustrial policy -- it would plot technology strategy, fundcommercial research projects and force the government to buyhigh-tech products the department backs -- but his allieswant him to tone down the rhetoric. &quot;They want me to go tothe White House and see if I get my head chopped off,&quot; Mr.Costello says.</TEXT></DOC>
