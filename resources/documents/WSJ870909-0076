Criteria for using those relatively high-risk bonds for collateral will apply only to future transactions and may not be used retroactively, Douglas Watson, a vice president of the rating concern, said. The question of retroactivity had sparked considerable debate.    Although the Moody's ban on using the criteria retroactively &quot;isn't carved in concrete,&quot; Mr. Watson said, &quot;circumstances would have to change significantly&quot; for the rating concern to lift it. Investors in earlier issues didn't expect a switch in collateral, he said.    In applying the guidelines, Moody's won't just examine the pool of collateral backing the securities, Mr. Watson said. It also will consider the financial condition and portfolio management skills of the issuer. Moody's expects to issue the guidelines this week.    One main concern of the guidelines is the liquidity of the bonds in the collateral pool, because Moody's wants to make sure the bonds can be easily sold if necessary. The lowest-rated bonds in the portfolio must come from issues of at least $50 million in size and can't represent more than 5% of the entire issue.    The guidelines also include diversification requirements that become increasingly stringent as the collateral moves down the rating scale. For single-B-rated collateral, for example, no more than 3% of the pool of bonds can come from a single company, and no more than 8% can be in a single industry.    Once those criteria have been met, Moody's also will insist on a high level of overcollateralization for a triple-A rating.    For instance, a collateral pool made up of single-B bonds would have to be between 181% and 213% of the issue's size. If the pool's credit quality and market value are re-examined and the pool is readjusted frequently, the required overcollateralization would move toward the lower end of the scale. The requirement would move up the scale as the readjustments become less frequent.    In no case, however, would Moody's be comfortable with pools that are readjusted less often than every nine weeks, Mr. Watson said. </TEXT></DOC>
