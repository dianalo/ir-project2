The jump in output in recent days has been led by Saudi Arabia, which previously vowed that it would step up its production if other OPEC member nations continued to exceed their output quotas. Similar developments led to the 1986 oil-price collapse.    World oil prices were still well above their 1986 levels yesterday, but markets remained weak nevertheless. In U.S. futures trading, spot-month crude oil settled below $14 a barrel for the first time in more than two years. November West Texas Intermediate closed at $13.92 a barrel, down 19 cents.    This month's OPEC output will average more than 20.6 million barrels a day, and &quot;the spectre of 21 million barrels a day is not out of the question for October,&quot; OPEC Listener, an analysis service of Energy Information Investments Ltd., said yesterday. That is far above OPEC's implied production ceiling of 17.5 million barrels a day and would be more than three million barrels a day above its output levels of last winter.    Despite a lull in the first half of September, much of the increase has come in the past several weeks as most of the cartel's 13 nations -- including Nigeria, whose oil minister is OPEC's president -- have exceeded their 1988 second-half production quotas. But the leaders in overproduction are the Persian Gulf Arab members of OPEC, with the Saudis setting the pace with aggressive new prices in recent days.    &quot;The Saudis seem to have been patient for a long time, and their objective is not to tear down the pricing structure but to get (others in OPEC) back on track,&quot; said Marshall Thomas, whose PetroMar Associates specializes in oil-market analysis.    Mr. Thomas said the Saudi strategy seems to be, nevertheless, to put downward pressure on oil prices at least for the next month or two while OPEC's ministers are preparing for further meetings. In a study for Oil Buyers Guide, Mr. Thomas determined that in the past seven to 10 days, Saudi Arabia has been offering all current customers discounts of 10 cents to 25 cents a barrel from contract prices for additional spot sales of Saudi crudes.    For the past year, Saudi Arabia has been basing its contract prices on market-related formulas. The formulas are adjusted in line with prices of three important crudes: Alaskan North Slope, North Sea Brent or Middle East Dubai, depending on the region where the Saudi oil is being sold. Currently, the average price under these formulas for the kingdom's Arab light crude is around $11 a barrel.    For more than a year, top Saudi officials including King Fahd have been emphasizing that the kingdom would no longer be OPEC's &quot;swing&quot; producer, letting its output fall to prop up the price of oil, but would expect to get a share of any increases in total OPEC output. Its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day in effect became a floor rather than a ceiling.    Since then, the United Arab Emirates has publicly renounced its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels a day and said it recognized a limit of 1.5 million barrels a day instead. In recent weeks, the emirates' production has surged even beyond that target, currently reaching two million barrels a day. Kuwait also has been producing beyond its quota -- by as much as 50%, based on current output of 1.5 million barrels a day.    Now, according to figures compiled by Cristina Haus, an analyst with Energy Information Investments, Saudi Arabia is single-handedly accounting for nearly one-third of this year's increase in OPEC production. She estimates Saudi Arabia's September production at 5.2 million barrels a day, 900,000 barrels a day above its OPEC quota.    &quot;Saudi Arabia is producing and storing lots of crude oil, but it's not putting it all into the market,&quot; a Saudi source said. But the stored oil &quot;is available and just as good as in the market,&quot; he said.    Other sources said the Saudis have tied up most available tankers for Persian Gulf loadings and that a lot of their oil is moving to the Caribbean. There, it will be ready to move into the market or to be traded to Texaco Inc. in a pending transaction under which the kingdom will acquire an interest in that company's U.S. refining and marketing assets.    Saudi Arabia doesn't actually count its oil as &quot;produced&quot; until it's sold. Thus, the stored oil doesn't count until it's marketed. Even so, senior Saudi officials were talking freely to their colleagues at this week's OPEC price committee meeting in Madrid about their increased production.    &quot;The Saudis want it known that they shouldn't be expected to hold the price line if the others are going to overproduce,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based consultant on OPEC affairs.    OPEC members who want higher oil prices are concerned about the possible repercussions of the increased output. For example, Julio Cesar Gil, Venezuela's new oil minister, was in Washington yesterday to &quot;lobby hard&quot; against a possible U.S. oil-import fee &quot;or any other restriction on Venezuela,&quot; according to John S. Herrington, U.S. energy secretary.    Mr. Herrington said in an interview that he told Mr. Gil Venezuela could maintain its fair share of the U.S. market through competitive pricing. He said the U.S. is interested in an expansion of free-trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere. But he said he told Mr. Gil, &quot;Your goals in OPEC are inconsistent with that, and you will be left behind.&quot;    The Reagan administration supports a free market in oil, Mr. Herrington said, and rumors that Saudi Arabia was putting pressure on oil prices because of an agreement with the U.S. are untrue. &quot;There is no tacit arrangement, either officially or unofficially,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
