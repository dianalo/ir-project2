The China Daily News said officials at the publishing house hadyet to determine if a worker planned the escapade or their machinesmalfunctioned.   Segments of the novel, ``Thoughts Under The Sun _ Dirty GhostsFrom A Dark Cantonese Corner,'' began appearing in ElementarySchool No. 10 Grammar Book, published this year.   So far, the paper said, it is unclear how many books includedthe pornography but 58,000 copies of the grammar book were printednationwide.   According to the report, the pornographic segment begins rightafter the grammar book's title page.   ``Chapter Three: Modern Prostitution,'' reads one section.``Part 1, Angels and Beasts. Part 2, Heaven and Nymphs. Part 3,Girls Looking For Fun.''   ``What follows is too dirty to read,'' the paper said.   Families around Xian, a major city in western China, firstdiscovered the books. Now they are demanding a recall.   ``It doesn't seem like the publishing company has much qualitycontrol,'' said the father of one student. ``If they do, is itpossible that they think the children need this kind ofenlightenment?''   According to the head of the Shanxi Province Printing Factory,the grammar book was printed at the same time as ``Thoughts UnderThe Sun.''   But, he said, an investigation of the problem had yet todetermine how it occurred.   ``Maybe it was a mistake, but maybe it involved a worker unhappywith the factory,'' he said.   ``Thoughts Under The Sun'' is a popular book and has gonethrough several printings.   Since 1978 and China's opening to the West, pornography of bothWestern and Chinese origin has become increasingly popular.</TEXT></DOC>
