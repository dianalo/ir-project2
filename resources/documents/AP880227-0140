Police clubbed members of the crowd of about 200 and someprotesters sustained minor injuries, authorities said. Eight peoplewere arrested on minor charges, police said.   Members of the anti-KKK group held a rally and burnedConfederate and Nazi flags in front of City Hall, where about adozen Klansmen had gathered to stage a news conference against theaffirmative action plan.   Members of the placard-carrying anti-KKK crowd surrounded theKlansmen and shouted ``Go away. ... Dallas doesn't want you. Wedon't want you.''   As the Klan marched around City Hall plaza, an elderly blackwoman was punched in the face by a white man, who was arrested foraggravated assault.   ``That was the worst thing. We put him right in jail. I don'tknow why he did it but it certainly instigated a few tempers topop,'' said Deputy Chief R.L. Schifelbein.   The anti-Klan protesters threw bottles and horse manure at theKlansmen as tactical squad police armed with clubs and mountedofficers tried to ring the hooded men and keep the crowd back.Police dogs converged on the scene as officers tried to break upthe feuding factions.   Skirmishes erupted several times during the one-hourconfrontation, with opponents in the crowd spitting on each other.   Klansmen seeking to escape the hostile crowd squeezed into carsand tried to leave the scene. As they were attempting to flee, anofficer hit one anti-Klan demonstrator in the stomach with a club.   Some of the demonstrators apparently resented police protectionof the Klan and shouted ``Cops kill the people!'' One man yelled``Shoot a cop!''   The demonstration also drew a group of ``skinheads,'' or whitesupremacists with shaven heads.The skinheads usually remainedoutside the ring of police protection, and it was between thisgroup and the crowd that most of the fights and pushing occurred.   The Rev. Leonard Charles Stovall led the anti-Klan crowd inprayer after the melee. Speaking of police, he said, ``Lord helpthem be responsible to everybody.''   Schifelbein said the Klansmen came from Connecticut.   ``We did not invite them. We don't want that kind of support. Wewant the support of the people of Dallas and not some idiot fromConnecticut,'' he said.   The news conference was scheduled by a man who identifiedhimself as David White, of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the KuKlux Klan based in Shelton, Conn.   The City Council implemented the affirmative action hiring planearlier this year in response to critics' charges that the policedepartment did not reflect the city's racial makeup.   Racial tension in Dallas increased in recent weeks after thefatal shootings of three police officers and four other men whowere shot by police.   The most controversial shooting was the death of white officerJohn Glenn Chase, who was killed by a mentally ill, black transientwho grabbed his gun and then shot him while a street-corner crowdwatched and some witnesses allegedly shouted ``Shoot, shoot!'' Thetransient was later killed by police.   After that shooting, Police Chief Billy Prince said criticism ofthe department by minority elected officials had fostered anenvironment of ill-will between the minority community and police.   Critics of the police have blasted the department, sayingofficers are too trigger happy when confronting minorities.Criticism of the department also led to a congressional hearinglast spring.   The latest shooting occurred Friday, when off-duty officer GaryD. McCarthy, 33, was gunned down during an attempted robbery at agrocery store where he was moonlighting as a security guard.   Saturday evening, police announced two arrests, and said one ofthe two men had late been released on personal recognizance bond.They gave few details, declining to name the suspects or givecharges against them.   The gunman was black and the victim white, but Prince said hedidn't think the shooting was racially motivated.   ``The problem is we have too many people on the streets whoshould be in the penitentiary,'' the chief said. ``There are toomany people on the streets who are mean.''</TEXT></DOC>
