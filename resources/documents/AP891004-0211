Joseph Biden, D-Del.,said as the Senate postponed action.   He said, however, that the court might well interpret theproposed changes as an effort to limit freedom of speech.   Sponsors had expected to pass the bill Wednesday afternoon butinstead ended up hoping to win approval on Thursday.   The bill is a response to the uproar that followed a decision bythe Supreme Court that overturned a Texas flag-burning ban lastJune.   Lawmakers also acknowledged that the bill represents a move tohead off a proposed constitutional amendment against flag-burning,set to come before the Senate in mid-October.   A number of senators, mainly Democrats, say amending theConstitution is not the proper way to deal with the issue, but manyother lawmakers say it is the only way to get around the courtdecision.   President Bush has called for a constitutional amendment againstflag burning, as have many congressional conservatives.   At issue were only three words that Republicans sought to add tothe House-passed legislation.   One amendment offered by Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., wouldmake it clear that flag desecration was banned only if it occurred``publicly.''   The other, sponsored by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., would makeit illegal to ``physically defile'' the flag.   The Supreme Court in the Texas case ruled in effect thatflag-burner Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted not for setting aflag afire but because he was engaging in political protest. Itsaid that limited his freedom of speech and overturned the law onthat ground.   Bill sponsors want the measure to avoid that problem by banningany flag desecration, regardless of whether it involves politicalprotest.   Debate over exactly what the Republican amendments would domeandered into semantic thickets unusual even for the Senate floor.   Biden said drily it was too bad former Sen. S.I. Hayakawa,R-Calif., a noted authority on semantics as well as a politician,was not still around to help out with the debate.   The bill differs only slightly from an existing federal lawagainst flag burning.   Current law bans any action that ``knowingly casts contempt uponany flag of the United States by publicly mutilating, defacing,defiling, burning or trampling upon it.'' It provides for penaltiesof up to a $1,000 fine and a year in jail. The Texas law had asimilar wording.   ``The statutory approach in my opinion is a futile andineffective gesture which will not pass the constitutional test atall,'' Hatch said.   Some critics said that there is no wide outbreak of flag burningin the United States and that the bill would encroach on freedom ofspeech as a means of fighting a danger that does not exist.   ``It's not needed for the maintenance of democratic freedom,''Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. said.   ``Of all things, today in the United States of America we needto encourage our people to be less afraid, speaking what theybelieve, letting their minds and hearts give rise to what theytruly think ought to be done,'' Kerrey told the Senate.   Kennedy also said provisions of the measure designed to makesure it would not be interpreted as an attack on dissent would bedifficult to deal with. For example, the measure would ban flagdesecration in private.   ``It will criminalize a great deal of relatively trivialbehavior,'' he said. ``It will change the flag from a treasuredsymbol to a government-regulated icon.''   Lawmakers made it clear from the outset, however, that the billwas popular enough to guarantee overwhelming approval.   ``I am going to vote for this,'' Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C.said. ``The people of my state are for it.''   ``The flag represents the very heart of what it means to be anAmerican and it would be a tragedy for us to let its power beundermined through legal desecration,'' Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,said.</TEXT></DOC>
