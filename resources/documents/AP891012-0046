Manuel Antonio Noriega said the militaryuprising failed because a second military leader pulled alast-minute double-cross.   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi said in interviews published today thatthe switch helped doom efforts by her husband, Maj. Moises GiroldiVega, to overthrow Noriega last week.   Giroldi, his widow said, planned the coup with a longtimefriend, Maj. Francisco Oleochea, commander of the elite Battalion2000.   Battalion 2000, a crack anti-riot unit, was airlifted to thescene of the fighting and _ instead of helping oust Noriega _ wenton to lead troops loyal to Noriega in crushing the coup.   ``Everything was ready,'' Mrs. Giroldi told The New York Times.``But Oleochea was playing a winner's game and he failed to comethrough because of his cowardice. He committed treason.''   In an interview with The Miami Herald, she countered U.S.officials' assertions that leaders of the failed coup were dividedover what to do with the Panamanian leader.   ``Everything was perfectly coordinated,'' Mrs. Giroldi said. ``Idon't think there ever was a dispute.''   She told the Times the coup was ``very well organized and coldlycalculated.''   Mrs. Giroldi, 36, told both newspapers the U.S. military inPanama had been informed in advance of the coup, and the coup hadbeen plotted by junior officers in the Panamanian Defense Forcesfed up with Noriega's alleged corruption and ``drunkenness.''   But the Herald termed Mrs. Giroldi's responses ``evasive'' whenshe was asked to what extent the U.S. military had promised to helpthe rebels.   ``My husband was convinced that the Americans and his owncompanions within the defense forces would support him,'' she said.   Mrs. Giroldi is staying with her three sons, her brother and herfather at a secret location in Miami. She was not at militaryheadquarters during the Oct. 3 coup attempt.   She told the Times her information came from officers who tookpart in the coup and fled to the United States.   Mrs. Giroldi also told the Herald that her husband may have lostthe last chance for a successful coup by not killing Noriega.   ``My husband may have had a moment of weakness,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
