In the mediumterm, the current buoyant investment seen during this period shouldpave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and helpreduce the dangers of inflation. The outlook is not, however,without risks.   ``Until now, the threat of inflation in many countries has beencontained, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments andmonetary authorities. But continued vigilance is required andinflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a firmpolicy response so that it will be put on a downward path.   ``All our countries share the responsibility for the sounddevelopment of the world economy. Over the medium term, deficitcountries have to play a key role in global adjustment through theirexternal adjustment and increased exports; surplus countries have tocontribute to sustaining global expansion trough policies providingfavorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports.   ``It is important to continue, and where appropriate, to developthis cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioningand the stability of the International Monetary System in a mannerconsistent with economic fundamentals.   ``The decline of saving in some of our countries in this decadeis a cause of concern. ... We recommend ... policies to encouragesaving and remove hindrances where they exist.   ``World trade developed rapidly last year. Yet protectionismremains a real threat. We strongly reaffirm our determination tofight it in all its forms.   ``We shall help developing countries by opening the world tradingsystem and by supporting their structural adjustment.   ``We urge developing countries to implement sound economicpolicies. A vital factor will be the adoption of financial andfiscal policies which attract inward investment and encourage growthand the return of flight capital.   ``We urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches intheir negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly toconclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction,debt service reduction and new money. We stress that officialcreditors should not substitute for private lenders. Our governmentsare prepared to consider as appropriate tax, regulatory andaccounting practices with a view to eliminating unnecessaryobstacles to debt and debt service reductions.   ``Decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protectthe Earth's ecological balance. We will work together to achieve thecommon goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environmentin order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carryout obligations to future generations.   ``Environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade,development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning.Therefore, environmental considerations must be taken into accountinto economic decision-making.   ``We encourage the World Bank and regional development banks tointegrate environmental considerations into their activities.International organizations, such as the OECD and the United Nationsand its affiliated organizations, will be asked to develop furthertechniques of analysis which would help governments assessappropriate economic measures to promote the quality of theenvironment.   ``The depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is alarming andcalls for prompt action.   ``We are committed to maintaining the highest safety standardsfor nuclear power plants and to strengthening internationalcooperation in safe operation of power plants and waste management,and we recognize that nuclear power also plays an important role inlimiting output of greenhouse gases.   ``Deforestation also damages the atmosphere and must be reversed.   ``Preserving the tropical forests is an urgent need for the worldas a whole. While recognizing the sovereign rights of developingcountries to make use of their natural resources, we encourage,through a sustainable use of tropical forests, the protection of allthe species therein and the traditional rights to land and otherresources of local communities.   ``Temperate forests, lakes and rivers must be protected againstthe effects of acid pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogenoxides. It is necessary to pursue actively the bilateral andmultilateral efforts to this end.   ``We condemn indiscriminate use of oceans as dumping grounds forpolluting waste.   ``We express our concern that national, regional and globalcapabilities to contain and alleviate the consequences of maritimeoil spills be improved. We urge all countries to make better use ofthe latest monitoring and cleanup technologies.   ``The drug problem has reached devastating proportions. We stressthe urgent need for decisive action, both on a national and aninternational basis. We urge all countries, especially those wheredrug production, trading and consumption are large, to join ourefforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and to carryforward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the launderingof its proceeds.   ``Accordingly, we resolve to take the following measures withinrelevant fora:   _Give greater emphasis on bilateral and United Nations programsfor the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries.   _Support the efforts of producing countries who ask forassistance to counter illegal production or trafficking.   _Strengthen the role of the United Nations in the war againstdrugs through an increase in its resources and through reinforcedeffectiveness of its operation.   _Intensify the exchange of information on the prevention ofaddiction, and rehabilitation of drug addicts.   _Support the international conference planned for l990 on cocaineand drug demand reduction.   _Strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative and mutualassistance on these issues....   _Convene a financial action task force from summit participantsand other countries interested in these problems.   ``We have accepted the invitation of the president of the UnitedStates to meet next year in the United States of America.''</TEXT></DOC>
