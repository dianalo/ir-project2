The harmful but relatively rare Datacrime virus is also calledthe Columbus Day virus because it attacks the day after thetraditional date for Columbus Day.   The virus is apparently more common in the Netherlands than inthe United States, American computer security experts have said.   Dutch newspapers said earlier this week that the Datacrime virushas reportedly spread to 10 percent of the Netherlands' personalcomputers, but Hague police spokesman Rob Brons said Friday that``those figures are possibly inflated.''   In the United States, there have been fewer than a dozenconfirmed sightings of the dormant virus by experts who dismantledit to figure out how it works. However, other computer owners couldhave it without knowing.   U.S. government officials have no solid idea of how prevalentthe virus is, but believe it is fairly uncommon, spokesman StewartKatzke of the National Institute of Standards and Technology saidFriday.   Brons said his force had sold ``hundreds'' of $2.35 floppy diskswith a program that purportedly detects and destroys the virus.   The virus, which some say was created by an unidentifiedAustrian computer expert, is expected to be activated when aninfected program is run anytime after Oct. 12 through Dec. 31,according to Joe Hirst, a British expert on viruses.   The virus wipes out the tables on the computer's hard disk sothe data and programs become inaccessible.   ``There's not much you can do about it. The only remedy is tofind it and get rid of it,'' said Hirst in a telephone interviewfrom Brighton, England.   The virus spreads through contaminated floppy disks or throughcontact with other computers in networks or over phone lines. Avirus is a computer program that attaches to other programs andmakes copies of itself.   Hirst said that as far as he knew the Netherlands was the onlyEuropean country in which the virus had been spotted.</TEXT></DOC>
