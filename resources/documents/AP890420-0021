The new work is based on satellite observations, which providemore complete information than previous data from ships and buoys,said researcher A.E. Strong.   The increase in sea-surface temperatures was observed fromJanuary 1982 to mid-1988, Strong reports in today's issue of theBritish journal Nature.   The observed rate is faster than most scientists have expectedfrom the greenhouse effect, a predicted global warming due tobuildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, Strongsaid in a telephone interview.   But it is premature to regard the findings as evidence of thegreenhouse effect, said Strong, a research oceanographer with theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and currently avisiting scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.   The findings may reflect only a temporary change rather than thelong-term warming predicted from the greenhouse effect, he said.Researchers lack comparable satellite data from previous years forlonger-term analysis, he said.   The average water temperature actually dropped about nine-tenthsof a degree during 1988, but has risen about two-fifths of a degreethis year through March, reaching a mark of about 66 degrees, hesaid.   The averages were derived from some 2 million to 3 millionsatellite observations a month, covering a global band that extendsas far north as the southern tip of Greenland and farther souththan the tip of South America.</TEXT></DOC>
