The agency alleged that the speculator, Louis Abrams of Boca Raton, tried to manipulate upwards the price of the September 1984 orange-juice futures contract by taking a dominant market position in the belief that the orange juice supply wasn't big enough to meet the demand represented by his contracts.    In its administrative complaint, the CFTC said that Drexel provided Mr. Abrams with a &quot;substantial part&quot; of the financing that he needed to take delivery on his contracts. One CFTC source estimated that Drexel loaned Mr. Abrams $10 million to $15 million despite the firm's policy against financing the taking of delivery by speculators.    On Sept. 17, 1984, the expiration date on the New York Cotton Exchange, Mr. Abrams held 98% of the orange juice contracts outstanding, according to the CFTC.    The complaint, filed yesterday by the CFTC's enforcement director Dennis Klejna, represents only the fifth price-manipulation case ever brought by the 14-year-old agency. It has just one case pending -- against the Hunt brothers of Texas, who are accused of manipulating silver prices in 1979-80.    The CFTC complaint also charged Drexel and Theodore Butler, a former account executive in the firm's Miami office, with unauthorized trading in the accounts of three other customers, and with various record-keeping and reporting violations. The New York-based firm and Richard Bermont, a co-manager of the Miami office, were also charged with failure to supervise the handling of these customers' accounts.    A Drexel spokesman said, &quot;These accusations concern trading three years ago with respect to a former customer's commodity brokerage account over which we had no discretion. At the time, we promptly and fully informed the commission staff of all details, and in fact Drexel provided active assistance to both the commission and the exchange. We don't believe these charges are warranted.&quot;    Mr. Abrams couldn't immediately be reached for comment.    A CFTC administrative law judge will hold hearings on the charges. The respondents face a variety of sanctions, including maximum $100,000 fines for each violation and the suspension or revocation of their CFTC registrations.    The agency said that Drexel's financing agreement with Mr. Abrams requires that he reimburse the firm for any fines that might be imposed by regulators.    According to the complaint, the firm carried -- and financed -- Mr. Abrams's position despite repeated warnings from the CFTC and the Cotton Exchange that it could cause a disorderly liquidation of the September 1984 contract. At the same time, the CFTC said, Drexel required all of its other speculative customers to liquidate their positions in the contract.    Mr. Abrams began buying orange juice contracts in January 1984, according to the complaint. By Aug. 31, he held 856 contracts, each calling for delivery of 15,000 pounds of frozen orange juice concentrate. His position represented 36% of the so-called open interest, or contracts outstanding that hadn't yet been liquidated or fulfilled by deliveries, the CFTC said.    Over the next two weeks, his share of the open interest steadily increased as other traders got out of the market, the CFTC said. On Sept. 13, 14 and 17, Mr. Abrams authorized Drexel to sell a small number of contracts at successively higher prices, but there were only a few takers, according to the complaint.    The contract price, meanwhile, rose 10 cents a pound of frozen concentrate -- from almost $1.71 on Aug. 31 to almost $1.81 on Sept. 17, the last day of trading in the contract, the CFTC said.    The agency alleged that Mr. Abrams acted &quot;with the intent of causing prices of the September future to be artifically high.&quot; But the complaint didn't indicate the extent to which Mr. Abrams may have profited from his trading.    Ultimately, Mr. Abrams took delivery on 669 contracts, or more than 10 million pounds of frozen concentrate, the CFTC said. That amounted to 94% of all deliveries on the September contract. </TEXT></DOC>
