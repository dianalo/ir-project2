McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government's chief economic forecastinggauge inched ahead 0.2 percent in September for its secondconsecutive monthly advance, the Commerce Department said today,indicating continued but slow growth in the months ahead.   The increase in the Index of Leading Indicators, designed toforetell economic activity six to nine months into the future,followed an advance of 0.5 percent in August that was revisedupward from a 0.3 percent gain reported earlier.   The often-volatile index was unchanged in July and had dipped0.1 percent in June. The July figure also was revised, down fromthe 0.1 percent increase originally reported.   Analysts said that, while the index indicates continued but slowgrowth, the immediate future will be a precarious time.   ``The economy looks very soft right now,'' said Bruce Steinberg,senior economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. Thenext few months ``will be a period of vulnerability,'' he added.   Underlining that concern, the Commerce Department also reportedthat sales of new homes plunged 14 percent in September, theirsteepest decline in nearly eight years, as interest rates creptback to the double-digit level of the preceding months.   New single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 618,000 last month, following a 3.1 percent declinein August.   The Labor Department, meantime, reported that employers' costsfor wages and benefits of workers climbed 1.6 percent in the thirdquarter and 5.1 percent in the past year, with health insurancepremiums again driving up benefit costs at a faster pace thansalaries.   Four of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make upthe composite index contributed to the September gain.   The index measuring consumer expectations was the largestpositive contributor last month and the major cause for the Augustand July revisions, the Commerce Department said.   Other positive factors were an increase in the money supply, alonger average work week and higher stock prices.   The other statistics pointed down, led by a decrease inmanufacturers' new orders for consumer goods. That was followed bya decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders; fewer orders forplants and equipment; faster vendor performance, meaning decliningdemand; higher initial unemployment claims; fewer building permitsand lower prices for sensitive materials. indicating weakeningdemand.   The various changes left the index at 145.0 percent of its 1982base of 100. So far this year, the index has fallen at an annualrate of 0.1 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent forthe first nine months of 1988.   The economy has been slowing since the Federal Reserve appliedthe brakes last year to dampen inflation. But while inflationappears to be abating, analysts are concerned the Fed's grip couldthrust the economy into recession.   Steinberg and other economists point to excessive inventoriesand slackening durable-goods orders, including a weaker demand fornew automobiles, as major threats to the economy because both couldtrigger growing unemployment and stagnant growth.   Other areas of concern include the nation's trade deficit, whichincreased in August after falling for two straight months, anddeclining corporate profits, which could affect stock market prices.   Steinberg and Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser forthe WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., both noted the consumerconfidence category as a major positive indicator in the Septemberindex.   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation'seconomic activity, accounted for much of the year's growth so far.   ``As long as confidence holds up, we probably won't have arecession,'' Chimerine said.   But he and other economists have noted that consumer spendinghas begun to wane and believe it will be substantially weaker inthe last quarter of the year, leading to a decline in manufacturing.   Chimerine said Hurricane Hugo and the Northern Californiaearthquake could promote the construction industry in the comingmonths as the disaster areas begin to rebuild.   But he also said the possible damage to factories in the areas,combined with commuting problems of employees, getting to workcould disrupt output.   ``At this point, it's difficult to say which might outweigh theother, but I don't expect any major effect on the economy,''Chimerine said.</TEXT></DOC>
