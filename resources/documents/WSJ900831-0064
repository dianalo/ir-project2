As a first step, the department's Occupational Safety andHealth Administration issued guidelines for preventing suchailments in the meatpacking industry. OSHA will seekagreements with 16 large packers with more than 1,000 workerseach to carry out those guidelines. The agency will conductspecial inspections of large plants if the companies refuseto sign such pacts. Inspections would begin in January.</LP><TEXT>   Afterward, similar agreements may be sought with 20packing companies that have 500 to 1,000 workers each, withinspections planned for non-signers. The inspections couldlead to OSHA citations for violating health standards.   In addition, the agency said it will soon beginrule-making proceedings aimed at upgrading rules onrepetitive-motion injuries in a wide range of industries. Itwould take several years to develop such standards, LaborSecretary Elizabeth Dole said.   She said the meat industry, which employs 140,000 workers,will get first attention because its rates of &quot;ergonomicillnesses&quot; are at least 10 times those of the generalpopulation. As new meatpacking technology puts more emphasison repeated-motion tasks under stressful conditions, &quot;theproblem has been getting worse,&quot; Mrs. Dole said.   Ergonomics involves adapting the workplace environment tothe needs of workers, rather than trying to make workersadjust to the workplace. Occupational health experts havebeen finding increased ergonomic hazards in recent years insuch industries as meatpacking, auto production andcommunications. They can cause disorders such as carpaltunnel syndrome, a crippling condition that often afflictsthe hands, wrists or arms of meatpacking or other workers.OSHA said that 48% of workplace health disorders involverepetitive motion.   The guideline techniques were developed recently byergonomists. They include detailed suggestions for analyzingrepeated-motion hazards; taking engineering or other steps toreduce or eliminate them; monitoring the health of workers,removing them from the hazardous work and providing timelytreatment; and training managers and workers to avoid theergonomic problems.   The United Food and Commercial Workers union, whosemembers work on meatpacking lines, praised the guidelines.But Allen Zack, a union spokesman, faulted the plan forcontinuing to rely on company records to measure how well aplant is eliminating repeated-motion hazards.   &quot;We should have learned our lesson by now,&quot; Mr. Zack said,noting criticism of meatpackers by some members of Congressas well as OSHA enforcement actions, both dealing largelywith inadequate recordkeeping.   Mr. Zack also complained that packers would be able toavoid inspections by signing agreements with OSHA that won'tbe subject to close monitoring by the union. By contrast, hecited a 1988 ergonomics agreement that involved the foodworkers union as well as OSHA and IBP Inc., a big meatpackerin Nebraska. OSHA has signed some other agreements withmeatpacking and auto companies since then.   The guidelines were praised by J. Patrick Boyle, presidentof the American Meat Institute, as using many recommendationsmade by the trade group's safety committee. &quot;Flexibility isthe key to these guidelines. Because they are not rules orstandards, plant management can pick and choose as theytailor ergonomic programs to their individual needs,&quot; whilealso &quot;exploring new ways to protect their workers,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
