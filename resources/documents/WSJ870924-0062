The unit's notes and debentures were upgraded to Baa-2 from Baa-3. Commercial paper of the Union Oil unit and the Union Oil Credit Corp. unit was upgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-3. The company's shelf registration was upgraded to provisional Baa-2 from provisional Baa-3.    The rating concern cited improvements in the balance sheet and financial flexibility of the Los Angeles-based oil company. It said Unocal has reduced by about $1 billion the debt it took on with a $4.1 billion share buy-back in 1985 to combat a takeover attempt led by oil executive and investor T. Boone Pickens Jr.    Although Unocal's financial leverage and fixed charges remain high, Moody's said, it believes the company can fund a capital spending program that would &quot;substantially maintain&quot; its oil and natural gas reserves and that &quot;gradual annual debt reduction can occur&quot; at the company. </TEXT></DOC>
