A 5145 A Ar{sup +} laser beam, focused to a 1.0{mu}m beam diameter, with incident intensities of 5--250 mW, scannedat rates of 20--200 {mu}m/s in air locally heated the optically absorbingfilms to induce reaction. Local melting was observed during the laserscans, indicating temperatures in excess of 950{sup 0}C induced in predominantlyperovskite phase films. Ablated grooves 1.5--3.0 {mu}m wide were generated,with destruction of the superconducting phase verified by optical microscopyover a wide range of laser parameters. Scanning Auger and energy dispersivex-ray analyses were used to monitor local chemical composition near thecuts. A wide range of behavior was found for etching of the amorphousprecursor films, ranging from simple ablation, to multiple phase segregation,to generation of periodic morphological structure characteristic of localplasma formation in the ejected plume. In contrast, the more opticallyabsorbing perovskite phase showed far less variation in microstructurewith laser power, with morphological changes confined to a 0.5 {mu}mrange about the cut. Green and sintered polycrystalline ceramic tapeshave also been successfully eteched.</TEXT></DOC>
