The move by Adobe, the dominant maker of so-called &quot;font&quot;software that tells a computer or printer how to formcharacters, is its first major move into vending of hardware.&quot;It's a change of direction for us as a company,&quot; said AdobePresident Charles Geschke.</LP><TEXT>   Until now, the company's Postscript font technology hasresided as software inside general purpose microprocessors,which perform the role of central commander in computers andprinters. But the software, which translates computer codethat represents characters into a form a printer or screenunderstands, is often a bottleneck that slows down theprocess.   The new Adobe chip, called the Adobe Type 1 Coprocessor,will perform the same task as that software, but 25 to 200times faster, Mr. Geschke said. Several printer makers aredeveloping machines using the chip and Adobe expects computermakers eventually to build the chip into their machines tohandle on-screen characters, Mr. Geschke said.   VLSI Technology Inc., San Jose, Calif., is making the chipunder license from Adobe, Mr. Geschke added.</TEXT></DOC>
