These coefficientswere determined from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field forEpoch 1980.0 with the secular variations applied in the forward directionfor a five-year time interval. The general trend of the vertical cutoffrigidities were calculated for previous epochs; the cutoff rigidity continuesto decrease in the South Atlantic, Central, and South American regionsand continues to increase in the North Atlantic. These results show thenecessity of utilizing the appropriate geomagnetic field model to determinecutoff rigidities for latitude surveys that are conducted in these regions- particularly for those surveys conducted during solar minimum.</TEXT></DOC>
