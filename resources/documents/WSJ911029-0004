Retired Gen. Wallace Nutting was indicted on conspiracy,fraud and obstruction of justice charges involving his workfor a now-defunct Florida contractor.</LP><TEXT>   In his career in the Army, Gen. Nutting won a PurpleHeart, commanded a crack armored regiment in Europe, and inthe early 1980s headed all U.S. forces in Central America. Inthe mid-1980s, he commanded the U.S. rapid-deployment forcesthat were reorganized under the control of Gen. NormanSchwarzkopf.   In addition to bringing the charges against Gen. Nutting,a federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., indicted seven otherformer executives of Sooner Defense of Florida Inc. Thecharges include conspiracy, bribery and money laundering.Among the defendants is Edward Geoghegan of Clearwater, Fla.,chairman and president of the company from 1983 to 1988.   Gen. Nutting released a statement through his attorneyssaying he was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the charges. He said he found it&quot;incomprehensible&quot; that prosecutors concluded he&quot;participated in an effort to sell defective ammunition.&quot;Gen. Nutting vowed to &quot;vigorously contest&quot; the charges.   John Lauro, one of Gen. Nutting's lawyers, said that hisclient served as a company director for much of the periodbut held the post of president for only one week. Mr. Laurosaid that Gen. Nutting voluntarily provided information toinvestigators and has been cooperating with the U.S.attorney's office for the past year.   Mr. Geoghegan couldn't be reached to comment.   The indictment charges that the conspiracy lasted nineyears and included making false statements to try to hide thefact that the concern sold allegedly substandard andpotentially hazardous fuses and munitions to the Pentagon.   Gen. Nutting was charged with giving the Army's inspectorgeneral allegedly false information about when he firstlearned about potential safety problems with certain fuses.Part of the 33-count indictment accuses the retired generalof altering a memo before it was turned over to DefenseDepartment investigators.   The company, among other things, produced fuses forartillery shells used by Bradley armored vehicles and forcertain Navy munitions. Prosecutors said the Pentagon tookspecial precautions to make sure that none of the suspectammunition was shipped to the Persian Gulf before the warwith Iraq.   The U.S. attorney's office in Tampa said it initially wastipped off by someone inside the company, and has beeninvestigating the matter for three years. Three other peoplehave been convicted on charges stemming from theinvestigation.   The indictment alleges that the conspiracy includedproviding the military munitions that didn't conform to itsspecifications, as well as trying to delay and obstruct anaudit or investigation of the company's billing or testingprocedures. According to the charges, the company illegallysubstituted materials, used non-conforming explosive powderand altered firing pins in some fuse assemblies. Companyofficials provided free meals and trips and offered sexualfavors to government inspectors or their relatives, theindictment charges.   The alleged conspirators also were accused of usinginflated profit figures to attract investors and obtain bankloans.   The indictment charges that when Gen. Nutting testifiedbefore the grand jury in April, he falsely said he couldn'trecall receiving information three years earlier that companyemployees had been cheating on certain tests.</TEXT></DOC>
