One woman dropped off aportable radio and a bag of batteries because her baby likes a certain rock'n' roll station. Another woman left a tape player and a cassette so her babycould always hear a familiar voice.;    &quot;Hi, Poo-Poo. It's Mommy and Daddy. Wemiss you.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  A DOG'S LIFE?

Oneman in Europe on an extended business trip called several times.;    &quot;Andbelieve it or not,&quot; said Karen Hughart, who made the conversation possible byholding the receiver to the baby's ear, &quot;he responded to the voice on thephone.&quot; Never one to eavesdrop, Karen said she didn't hear what was said.;   In each of these cases, the baby was a cat.;    It's vacation time again, andthat means if you're planning to travel, you and your pet will probably haveto part company.;    You could take your pet with you, but that kind ofdefeats the purpose of a vacation, which is to go someplace where nobody knowsyou and to do strange things. Unless, of course, you're one of those peoplewho puts clothes and funny hats on your pet. Then you probably asked your petif you could go along with it.;    But let's say you have a pet and a two-weekvacation, two things that are mutually exclusive.;    You could con yourneighbor into coming over and checking on little Fifi every day. But when youreturn, your pet will have either turned into a bad toupee, or it will havebecome so attached to the neighbor that they both attack you when you walk inthe door.;    Another alternative is to empty a 100-pound bag of food into abowl and let the animal fend for itself. But since pets are notorious eatersof anything that's available, this could lead to the dreaded Exploding PetSyndrome.;    To avoid this, you may need to board your pet. This can be doneat something called a pet motel, also known as pet resorts, pooch palaces andcanine country clubs. These places used to be called kennels, and some stillare.;    But &quot;kennel&quot; just didn't seem like an adequate description. Afterall, consider the amenities some offer:;    (check) Blanket and snacks atbedtime, closed-circuit TV.;    (check) Stereo music, home-cooked meals.;   (check) 24-hour security.;    (check) Air-conditioned &quot;living quarters.&quot;;   (check) Love (no tranquilizers).;    (check) Waterfront view cat condos.;   (check) Separate eight-foot cat suites.;    How many of these things do youget on a regular basis?;    The point is that pet-watching is a big,competitive business, and the people who run pet motels take their callingseriously.;    Karen and John Hughart, who operate the Pasadena, make suretheir guests get regular exercise, lots of attention and good food, includingturkey on Christmas and Thanksgiving. (Bird guests eat their normal food andare not told about the special meal.);    The thermostat is always set at 70degrees, the stereo is perpetually tuned to an easy-listening station, and therates are reasonable, between $7.50 and $11.50 a day.;    But if you can'tbear the thought of boarding your pet, you might consider hiring aprofessional pet-sitter. These are people who come to your house to spendquality time with your critter.;    For a $10 fee, Tina Heselton or one of the18 people who work for her at Pampered Pets Inc. in Tampa will spend abouthalf an hour feeding your pet, walking it and cleaning up if it &quot;made aboo-boo.&quot; They'll also water plants, bring in the mail and check the house.;   Besides dogs and cats, Heselton has cared for iguanas and Amazon parrots, andWolfen, a 110-pound wolf/malamute mix owned by an elderly couple.;    &quot;We alsohave two cats, Martini and Rossi, that we turn on a video for,&quot; Heselton said.&quot;It's a 30-minute video of birds flying and singing. They sit there in frontof the TV watching their tape while I fix their lunch.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM ZUCCO, St. Petersburg Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  South Pasadena, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910630  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4T  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  702  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 30, 199100182001,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
