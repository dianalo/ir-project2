The appearance of these termscan be formally considered as a result of the splitting of the levelsof the p/sup N/ configuration of the atom (or the {pi}/sup N/ of thelinear molecule) in a low symmetry field. For the atomic shell of thep/sup N/ state we obtained the concept of two-particle spinless densitythrough the one-particle density, which allows the expression of thea and b coefficients in the corresponding Roothaan energy functionalthrough the orbital and spin moments and the number of electrons.</TEXT></DOC>
