With cattle lowing in the background and dust swirling throughthe air, the leaders of the free world threw horseshoes, sampledbarbeque and watched cowboys at work Sunday evening.   President Bush appeared to delight in showing his VIP guests acountry-style evening of entertainment before they turned theirattention to Monday's economic summit opening.   They tramped through sawdust-covered artificial turf to ahorseshoe pit and took a turn at Bush's favorite pasttime. Thepresident out-pitched his guests, landing two ringers. Then theytrooped through a buffet line, plates awkwardly in hand, to samplesome of the 3{ tons of meat barbecued for the occasion.   The president also lined up a rodeo and a rare out-of-townperformance by the Grand Ole Opry for his guests' amusement.   The men were dressed casually: Bush and Canadian Prime MinisterBrian Mulroney both sported the fancy ostrich cowboy boots madeespecially for the economic summit. Japan's leader, Toshiki Kaifu,showed off an oversize western belt buckle. British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher picked her way through the sawdust inwhite-and-black heels.   Cowboys were competing in such events as bareback riding, bullriding, barrel racing and calf scramble, said Dan Gaddis of theHouston Livestock Show andamp; Rodeo, an annual affair that draws morethan a million people each winter.   ``What could be better than a rodeo, great country music and`the taste as big as Texas,''' said Mike Jolley, president ofHouston-based Luther's Bar-B-Q Inc., which was providing the foodfor the rodeo party, which was expected to draw several thousandpeople.   It took 140 workers more than four days to slow cook all thatbarbecue, including brisket, sausage, chicken and ribs. Crews alsomade more than 1{ tons of coleslaw, potato salad and beans.   Naturally, there were also 1,250 gallons of barbecue sauce,pickles and jalapenos, 500 pounds of onions, more than 5,000servings of cobbler and carrot cake and 650 gallons of lemonade andiced tea.   Bush and the foreign leaders were dining on china made byAustin, Texas, potter Teri Vance Hubbeling, who said she had workednearly non-stop since being asked to create the 63 festive plateswith a Texas theme. She designed three different patterns _ acentered longhorn with green cactus in the background and bluetrim, a race horse with boots in the background and a longhorn withbarbed wire in the background.   Rocky Carroll, who has made numerous boots for Bush, said heworked about 40 hours to create each pair of the full-quill ostrichboots for the visiting leaders.   The boots sport the seven flags of the participating nationsacross the top. Each boot's center front has a Texas flag and``Houston'' stitched along the bottom. The leaders' initials arestitched in gold along the side.   ``These are the finest pair of boots I've ever made,'' saidCarroll, owner of R.J.'s Boot Co. in Houston.   Carroll also provided the sterling silver belt buckles with goldinlay, beaver cowboy hats and boot bags. The Grand Ole Oprypresented mandolins for the leaders.   The Opry performance marked only the second time in 40 years thecountry show had left its Nashville home. The first was in 1988,for a special show in Tampa, Fla., in connection with the Hall ofFame football game.   Besides Minnie Pearl and Charley Pride, stars on hand were toinclude Loretta Lynn and Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers.</TEXT></DOC>
