In these standards, OSHA reducedthe 8-hour time weighted average (TWA) permissible exposure limit (PEL)to 0.2  f/cc, and established other protective provisions. This standardwas legally challenged, and as a result, the Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia upheld the standard except that the court held that OSHA mustreconsider several of the standard's provisions to determine if more protectiveregulatory provisions are available to reduce risk.One of the issues to be reconsidered was the need for an excursion limit.In response, OSHA promulgated an excursion limit for occupational exposureto asbestos as 1 f/cc averaged over a 30-minute sampling period. A legalnotification of this amendment was published on September 14, 1988, at53 FR 35610.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviewed the collection of informationrequirements in the expanded asbestos standard in accordance with the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>, and 5 CFR Part 1320. All information requirements containedin andSection; 1910.1001 in paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(5), (d)(7), (f)(2),(f)(3)(i), (j)(5), (l), and (m), and 29 CFR 1926.58 (f)(2), (f)(3), (f)(6),(h)(3)(i), (k)(3), (k)(4), (m), and (n), as they apply to the excursionlimit, have now received OMB paperwork clearance under OMB clearance numbers1218-0133 and 1218-0134.
