 Until now.andM;A new breed of software -- database-publishing products for the PC -- readsinformation from a database-management system (DBMS) and formats it into adesktop-publishing page layout.andP;  The resulting file can be produced on alaser printer or a phototypesetting system.andM;These are stand-alone products that do not merely convert data files into aformat that can be read by, say, Xerox Corp.'s Ventura Publisher or AldusCorp.'s PageMaker.andP;  They also let users automatically update the page layoutsas the database records change.andM;''A database-publishing application is any publication that is revisedregularly or irregularly, that uses shared data, data maintained separatelyor data produced in multiple formats, such as electronic publishing or CD ROM[compact disk, read-only memory],'' said William Perdue, founder ofPublicationBase, a database-publishing software developer in Petaluma, Calif.andM;Database-publishing applications include price lists, catalogues,dictionaries and encyclopedias, textbooks, legal publishing, annual reports,telephone directories and advertising, according to Perdue.andM;So far, few products have appeared that are billed specifically asdatabase-publishing applications.andM;XVP/Base, from The Laser Edge in Oakland, Calif., automatically processestagged dBASE records for exporting to Ventura Publisher.andP;  DataTag, fromPublishing Solutions Inc. of New York, converts database records into atagged ASCII file, which is then loaded into a desktop-publishing stylesheet.andM;Laserline FutureComp, from Quality Software Inc. of Newton, Mass., is aC-programmer's tool kit for creating custom database-publishing applications.andM;However, dbPublisher, a $695 package from Digital Composition Systems ofPhoenix, Ariz., is in many ways the vanguard of this new category.andP;  It offersthe file-tagging and conversion capabilities of XVP/Base and DataTag, but isalso a full-blown desktop publisher as well, with built-in page-layout andtypographical functions.andM;Although database publishing is being touted by press and industrysoothsayers as the latest, hottest development in PC software, the concepthas been around for some time.andM;''It's the current buzzword, but people have been publishing databases foryears,'' said Michael Kless, president of Publishing Solutions.andP;  High-enddatabase-publishing products have been dedicated systems, costing $50,000 to$100,000, that typically produce telephone directories and parts cataloguesfor the U.S.andP;  Army, he said.andM;The current database-publishing products bring this capacity down toPC-equipped business users.andP;  ''Some people would get these expensive systems,which is overkill when all they might need is a PC,'' said Kless.andM;In the past, traditional methods for database publishing have been expensiveor time-consuming affairs.andM;DBMS systems such as Ashton-Tate's dBASE and Microrim's R:base provide somedatabase-publishing functions in their report generators, but thesecapabilities are usually inadequate, according to Jim Cavuoto, publisher ofmicroPublishing Report, a desktop-publishing newsletter based in Torrance,Calif.andP;  Report generators are not able to produce professionally designeddocuments.andM;''The true acid test is, can [a DBMS] lay out a two- or three-columnnewsletter where the content of a given article is undetermined?'' saidCavuoto.andP;  ''That's where a traditional DBMS falls apart.andP;  It can't take avariable-length piece of information and wrap that several columns or dealwith conditional layouts.''andM;There are exceptions to this rule.andP;  For instance, users of Nantucket Corp.'sClipper database software can look for third-party software add-ins topublish their databases.andP;  Flipper Graphics Library, from ProWorks inHermiston, Ore., is one such add-in product.andM;Another alternative method of database publishing is to create an ASCII fileof data records and take it to a typesetter or printer.andP;  In the case of atime-sensitive price list, however, by the time the typeset document has beenreceived, the prices may have changed.andM;The growing user demand for database-publishing software has not beenoverlooked by vendors of established desktop-publishing products.andM;The latest release of PC PageMaker, version 3.0, includes import utilitiesthat ''filter'' dBASE III files, according to Mike Sherwood, product managerfor PageMaker for the Seattle firm.andM;''Users want import filters built into the mainstream products,'' saidSherwood.andP;  After a database file is imported to PageMaker, the user basicallycreates a style sheet, he said.andP;  ''We used to import just ASCII, but now itinterprets DBFs [database files] like dBASE, Paradox and dBASE clones.''andM;Users have been able to create directories and catalogues on PC PageMakersince the product's introduction in 1987.andP;  ''We talked to corporate users,and 90 percent of what people want to do with databases, we do,'' saidSherwood.andM;The next version, 2.0, of Ventura Publisher will be able to importdBASE-compatible files and database files from Borland International Inc.'sParadox, according to Randi Doeker, business-planning manager for Xeroxdesktop products in Rochester, N.Y.andP;  Database records can be read intoVentura Publisher and arranged as a table to create phone or personneldirectories, she said.andM;''There are plans to add more [database file] formats,'' Doeker claimed.andO;''Database publishing is the next hot button, based on press and userinquiries.andP;  Our engineers are real interested in this area, and there arelots of challenges they are tackling.''andM;Small AdvancesandM;Ashton-Tate's Byline version 2.0 includes a dBASE link feature that allowsusers to import single or multiple records from dBASE III Plus and dBASE IV.andO;Other products with limited database-publishing functions include Letraset'sReady-Set-Go, Acorn Plus Inc.'s Easy Laser and Command Technology Corp.'sGML/PC version 3.0.andM;With ScenicSoft Inc.'s ScenicWriter, automatic processing is accomplished byuser-defined macros that retrieve tagged database information and positionthose records on a page layout.andM;In spite of these advances, the use of desktop-publishing software tomanipulate database records is not an easy process, according to SusanDockeray, vice president of sales and marketing at Digital CompositionSystems.andP;  ''For someone currently using Ventura Publisher, the way it'sorganized you must write a lot of code to do the tagging.andP;  It's verytime-consuming,'' she said.andM;Although users can create a style sheet that will accept database records,Dockeray noted, whenever they do an update, much of the work has to be doneagain.andP;  ''Ventura Publisher requires a lot of user interaction each time.''andM;Database-publishing products, then, are really automated document processors,according to PublicationBase's Perdue.andP;  The whole process should be rununattended, he said.andM;''People who manage catalogues and price lists don't want to check the dataon the pages every time the data is reprocessed,'' said Perdue.andP;  ''They don'twant to understand desktop publishing.andP;  They want to push a button and let itgo.''andM;Database-publishing products eliminate the need to reformat data fields, afeature that saves time, according to Jim Smith, president of The Laser Edge.andO;''They will by no means replace a $100,000 dedicated system, but they will dosome of the applications.''andM;As more database-publishing products appear, DBMS and desktop-publishingvendors will start supporting each other's file formats, according tomicroPublishing's Cavuoto.andM;''Byline and Ventura Publisher have some hooks for some database-publishingcapabilities which haven't been exploited,'' he said.andM;But beyond the importing and arranging of database records into page layouts,the future of database-publishing applications has yet to be defined.andM;''When desktop publishing first came out, remember the off-the-wallapplications people used them for that surprised everybody?andP;  It's the samewith database publishing,'' said Cavuoto.andP;  ''It becomes such a flexible toolthat people will be able to do types of publishing and products that justaren't being done today -- in addition to being able to do their databasesmore effectively.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
