One obvious need for fast, parallel processing is thecolor and PostScript applications.andP;  A number of vendors are taking a seriouslook at Transputers as a way to get the processing power needed to deal withreal-time image manipulation, especially in color.andM;A single Transputer-a 10-mms Risc processor in its own right-makes a niceon-the-fly processor for compression and decompression of color images.andP;  Butwith the right software, a vendor could make a color computer as fast asneeded by simply putting more Transputers into the device.andP;  The Transputerarchitecture is inherently scalable; a vendor could offer a range of productsat different prices, all running the same software.andM;Harlequin REP.andP;  Equally evident is the need for fast PostScript for screendisplays and for image recording on plain paper and film .andP;  Harlequin, a UKcompany, has been working with Inmos to develop a fast, Transputer- basedPostScript RIP called Scriptworks.andP;  The device wiU run on a single Transputerprocessor and can be expanded by the addition of multiple processors wherehigher speed and higher resolution are required.andM;To date, we have only seen the Harlequin RIP driving a screen display.andP;  Ithas not been demonstrated driving either a low-res plain-paper device or ahigherresolution film recorder.andP;  But those are in Harlequin's plans.andP;  For thehigh-res applications requiring substantial increases in processing speeds,the Transputers seem to be a natural fit.andP;  If all things fall into place,Harlequin might have a clone product to show at the Seybold Conference, whichwill be in progress while this issue is at the printer.andP;  It would putHarlequin squarely into competition with the other high-speed PostScriptclone manufacturer from the UK, Hyphen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
