 The clearmessage is a focus on integration, more than the component parts.andP;  In fact,our report on its booth is more of a philosophical one than a review of anynew products.andP;  There wasn't anything really new since we last reported on it.andM;Our discussions with Atex centered on its latest campaign to educate thebuyer on the importance of integration, zoning, the threat of decliningcirculation and the ultimate reality of a page-count explosion.andM;In its ad campaign, it is stressing that newspaper are losinf theiradvertising share to a variety of sources, not the least of which are freesheets and small local papers.andP;  It points out that the only solution for themetro papers is to offer a competitive product with competitive ad rates.andO;This means zoning of one sort or another.andP;  With zoning, it predicts a hugeincrease in the page count--a major production problem for newspapers notpresently equipped to deal with this reality.andM;The Atex solution?andP;  Integration.andP;  It feels that the most effective thing itcan do to help its customers at the moment is integrating the productionprocess to allow newspaper to handle the eventual page explosion--not workingon front-end features.andP;  Providing the tools for zoning and tracking data isthe answer.andP;  It doesn't believe that the complexity that results from zonedmetropolitan papers can be handled by piecemeal page makeup solution; itfeels that the problem requires the horsepower and extensive experience Atexcan provide.andM;But this horsepower and experience cost more than newspapers have beenwilling to pay--at least the majority of them.andP;  This is why Atex is settingout to convince them that they will require these larger, more complexsystems to handle complex problems stemming from zoning.andM;The bottom line is that Atex will focus more on pagination than on individualsubsystems such as editorial, classified and display ad systems.andP;  Rather thansimply try to make the systems cheap, it will educate customers about whythey need to spend the sums they have been reluctant to part with in thepast.andP;  Atex will do this by showing customers what it has learned in itspagination experience and explaining what pagination can do for the user andthe problems it solves.andM;Atex's competitors will surely welcome this effort.andP;  In the perspective ofcurrent pricing structures, many vendors are wondering how many of them cansurvive.andM;Agfa, ready for Newstec, shows cameraandM;Agfa Compugraphic showed a Macintosh-based system using standard desktoptools and driving its line of PostScript imagesetters, but the focus of theexhibit wasn't on editorial and classified systems.andP;  These will be featuredat the upcoming Newstec show in the UK, where CG has a strong newspapersystems operation.andM;Instead, Agfa focused on a new electronic camera that we discuss undergraphic systems.andM;Alfa moves pagination to OS/2andM;Alfa System Partner is the software contractor for the newspaper editorial,advertising and pagination elements of two major systems being developed inEurope using IBM mainframe hardware: one in Germany, the other inSwitzerland.andP;  As we have reported previously, these two systems use the sametext editor and composition program.andP;  We weren't able to get good statusreports on these developments.andM;Meanwhile, the basic Alfa system, which is built around Prime 32-bitmicrocomputers running under the Primos operating system, remains much thesame as a year ago.andP;  Nokia PCs linked to the Prime computers handlecomposition and editing tasks.andM;One recent development on this platform is a soft typesetter to run in thePC.andP;  The Nokia PC can now also be used to run all the commercial functionsthat Alfa supports, including circulation and accounting.andP;  For theseapplications, a standard PC keyboard is used instead of the special Nokiaone.andM;The main change to the system is that the pagination software that originallyran on the Cadmus Unix workstation hardware is now running on a PS/2 platformunder OS/2.andP;  Alfa has developed its own window manager rather than usingPresentation Manager.andP;  The layout module has been ported from Cadmus, and theremainder of the software was developed specifically for the PS/2.andM;Alfa sees OS/2 as being the key front-end operating system software for thefuture.andP;  For display advertisements, the company has an agreement to use theMS-DOS and Windows version of Archetype Designer.andP;  It is linked into the Alfasystem and reads text directly from the Alfa database.andM;Alfa is a major Chelgraph OEM; it sells Chelgraph's typesetters and printers.andO;It is finding an increasing demand for PostScript in Germany, and its seesChelgraph's new Universal RIP as ideal for this.andP;  Soon, Alfa will also usethe Chelgraph LCGS system for handling graphics.andM;Apple shows Anaya, ArabicandM;Appearing as an exhibitor for the first time at an IFRA show, Appli provideda stand for a number of its VARs.andP;  These included Anaya, which also had itsown stand; QED, which we will report on at Newstec; certain UK apple centersshowing Electronic Publisher systems; and Diwan, a new UK-based Arabicnewspaper system vendor that is publishing a newspaper using Macintosheslinked to remote Hyphen macintosh/Ultre typesetters throughout Europe and theMiddle East.andP;  (We plan to visit Diwan soon to see this system in operation).andM;Camex: no changes from Du PontandM;There wasn't much few Camex since we last saw it, although rotation of imageswas being demonstrated.andP;  But we might have expected some news relating to theacquisition by Du Pont.andP;  When we asked about possible changes in direction,we were told: Same as before.andP;  &quot;No changes in direction, in markets or inproducts.&quot;andM;There is no way to guess what any large company will eventually do (anythingat all) with an acquisition such as the Camex one, especially when the largecompany is in the chemically business.andP;  So we'll just have to wait.andM;Since ANPA, Camex has given a name to the Sun-based front-endeditorial/classified/pagination system that it is building initially for theHouston Chronicle: &quot;Whirlwind.&quot;andM;But besides announcing that name, Camex may have made more news on anotherfront: the fate of its DOS-based Intertext system, which was conspicuous inits absence.andP;  No one would comment on what is in store for the Internetsystem.andP;  That, in conjunction with the focus on the Sun developments, led usto wonder how much development is taking place on the DOS platform.andM;CCI Europe: pagination and WatchdogandM;CCI Europe was one of the highlights of the exhibition.andP;  CCI is one of theleading European commercial system suppliers and probably the leading YellowPages system supplier in the world.andP;  A veteran of many IFRA shows, CCI hasattracted attention with its Sun-based PageChamp pagination systems.andP;  AfterIFRA in 1988, CCI decided to set up a team to concentrate on customaplications, and it targeted the newspaper market.andM;At IFRA, CCI introduced three new products.andP;  The first was a displayadvertisement makeup system, AdChamp (see p. 20); the second was a pagemakeup system, NewsChamp; and the third was a production control system forpage makeup.andM;For control of page layout, CCI has its own page definition language todefine page areas, geometry, etc., to which it has interfaced InformationEngineering's OC News Layout.andP;  CCI has also reached agreements with IBM inBelgium and France and with Unisys in Italy to include CCI products in itssystems.andP;  In  IBM's case, the products run on the PC-RT 6150 workstationsunder AIX.andM;CCI has a number of beta installations for these systems.andP;  They include LeSoir in Brussels, Le Provencal in Marseille, Il Gazetino in Venice (where itis linked to an Atex system), and Il Messagero in Rome (part of a Unisyssystem).andP;  There also are two beta sites in Germany.andM;The production control facility built into the system includes a functioncalled Watchdog.andP;  Watchdog keeps a continuous watch on the database to seewhat is being stored and what its status is.andP;  This function was beingdemonstrated in a Unisys application together with XyWrite and PC NewsLayout.andM;Unisys has its own version of XyWrite with its own Italian handamp;j.andP;  In thedemonstration, a page layout was prepared with PC News Layout and copy waswritten in XyWrite to fit the allocated space.andP;  When the copy conformed tothe layout and was stored on the database, it was identified by Watchdog andinstantly displayed on a Sun screen in made-up form.andP;  The format was pickedup by the NewsChamp software to build the page automatically.andM;Watchdog, which allows up to eight pages to be open on the screen at onetime, lets an editor see all the activity on each page as it happens.andP;  Theeditor can use the mouse to ascertain the status of any item within the pageplan, and to view any page as it is being assembled elsewhere in the system.andO;This is an interesting, promising approach, not unlike what Talbot wasdemonstrating, although Talbot's implementation has significant differences.andO;The CCI system is in operation at Il Gazetino in Venice.andM;Crosfield: no new carpets here, eitherandM;Since, Du Pont decided not to put any new carpets in the ImagiTex and Camexbooths, it did likewise with Crosfield.andP;  That is, it left its recentacquisition to dend for itself.andP;  The harder we try to figure out the impactof the Du Pont takeover, the more we get the feeling that these strategicdirections are still being worked out and won't become public information anytime soon.andM;Putting that issue aside for a moment, we turned our attention to what newitems Crosfield had to show.andP;  Everything was on display, from color systemsto the powerful picture desk to the newspaper and graphic systems.andP;  Weconcentrated on the two new areas that Crosfield is about to put intoproduction: classified pagination and the 2750 graphic subsystem.andM;Graphic subsystem.andP;  First, let us consider the graphic subsystem.andP;  It may behelpful to cleaer up the naming of the product, which has been confusing.andO;For newspapers, Crosfield has two distinct graphic subsystems for handlingscanned graphics: the 2710 and the 2750.andM;The 2710 is the lower-end product, intended for scanning line art and logos,which captures data from a Xerox 7650 scanner, stores the data in a PCdatabase, and allows manipulation on the PC itself.andP;  It features low-cost,simple operation at the expense of limited storage and basic functionality(compared to the higher-end product).andP;  We hace reviewed the 2710 before, mostrecently in our ANPA coverage.andM;For larger newspapers, requiring more sophisticated image manipulation ofline art and contones, and more storage and throughput, Crosfield hasintroduced the 2750.andP;  Names such as Avon, Galaxy, and now Pictor relate tothis product, but the graphic subsystem itself is simply the 2750.andP;  Thegraphic terminal, a Crosfield proprietary design, is called Galaxy.andP;  For now,forget all the other names, which just confuse the issue.andM;The 2750 can take input from a variety of sources, including the 2710 itself,the Newsline picture desk, and Autokon input via a SCSI port.andP;  All inputfiles are captured in the background, freeing the operator to concentrate onimage manipulation.andP;  Using the Galaxy terminal, operators can call up imagesand perform almost any image manipulation task that newspapers or magazineswould need.andM;Crosfield has applied its own user interface to the operation.andP;  Although theinterface is nonstandard, it appears to be quite effective.andP;  Like most otherpicture and image manipulation products, the 2750 presents images asthumbnails for selection purposes.andM;When the operator is working on an image, the high-resolution version isalways available for manipulation.andP;  As the operator performs variousfunctions to the screen image, the operations are applied to the high-resimages and reflected back to the screen.andP;  This process is not instantaneoustoday.andP;  Much of the interaction between the screen-resolution manipulationsand the actual final-resolution results must be linked.andP;  The 2750 is at stagewhere the user can get a feel for what can be done.andM;All of the functionality of the lower-end 2710 is provided: cropping, sizing,rotating, etc.andP;  It can also &quot;degang&quot; or break apart multiple images that mayhave been gang-scanned to save time.andP;  Full global tonal adjustments arecurrently supported.andP;  Crosfield has added a nice touch where the user can panacross the image in real time to see how portions of the image have beenchanged via tha global adjustments.andP;  The system hasn't yet added any localadjustments.andM;The 2750 currently includes irregular cropping and montaging, but the moresophisticated aspects of silhouetting and automatically dropping out thebackground are planned for later implementation.andP;  Crude pixel editing is alsoin the product today; plans also call for extensive enhancements to thisarea.andM;Crosfield says that the 2750 is due to be beta tested by the end of thisyear.andP;  This is a bit later than expected, and it may still be optimistic,judging by what we have seen.andP;  The product has a long way to go to matchusers' possible expectations, based on the capabilities Crosfield hasdemonstrated in its color products.andP;  But knowing the experience level there,few doubt that Crosfield will come through.andP;  For now, it's more a question ofwhen.andP;  The current product is clearly moving in the right direction, but itneeds the refinements (and speed) we have come to expect from Crosfield.andM;The 2750 is more just another terminal for image manipulation.andP;  In the schemeof things for a total system, the 2750 is the graphic database for displayads and news pages.andP;  It will eventually add all the background processing togather all the graphic components of an ad on input and assign them to the aditself.andP;  At the end of the cycle, purging will automatically delete theappropriate graphics associated with ads (and pages).andM;Much of this work is yet to be done.andP;  For now, the system does handle a basicroutine for purging graphic elements, based on the graphic's time stamp andthe ad's schedule.andP;  But most of the refinements are expected in the finalproduction node, which Crosfield calls PICS.andP;  Baltimore is scheduled for thispart of the system before the next big trade show.andP;  We will try to follow upto track the product from this point on.andM;ClassWizard.andP;  The other product that Crosfield is almost ready to release fortesting is the ClassWizard.andP;  This batch and interactive product running onVax workstations under VMS pulls all the ads from the classified and displayad database, algorithmically places them onto pages, and lets the user decideif alterations are necessary.andP;  If so, he can manually move ads and reflow thepages.andM;Functionally, the ClassWizard is really starting to reach its potential.andP;  Ithas excellent control over VJ space and gives the user many options indealing with extra white space.andP;  The algorithms for ad placement are alsocomplete.andP;  Our only possible concerns are in the areas of performance andease of use.andM;It is unfair to criticize the product on performance, because the optimizingstage hasn't begun.andP;  The engineers are still adding features and functions tomeet the initial requirements to put it into production.andP;  Based on what wehave seen, it shouldn't be too hard to speed the ClassWizard up to acompetitive level.andM;The ease of use area may be more difficult.andP;  We found it cumbersome tomanually place ads before the batch pagination process begins.andP;  Within theprogram, it is also difficult to select the classifications or other order ofclassifications that are to be paginated.andP;  This can be done, but not with theease and straightforwardness of other products.andM;There is still time to refine the ClassWizard before its installation in thecoming months.andP;  But before it enters full production, there are more areasthat Crosfield will have to address.andM;NewsWizard.andP;  We expected the ClassWizard to be further along based on what wehad seen at ANPA in June.andP;  But we didn't expect the NewsWizard to be in asgood shape as it was.andP;  We were very impressed.andM;The NewsWizard isn't ready for production either, but we didn't expect it tobe.andP;  The functionality as a layout and makeup terminal is coming along verywell.andP;  It seems that Crosfield is taking many of the old Hastech NewsPro'sbetter features and adding some features of the Magicians.andM;We have seen before that the NewsWizard can shine or die based on itsdemonstration.andP;  This time it shined.andM;As a makeup terminal, most of its functionality to place stories, ads andpictures is in place.andP;  Some is a little shaky, but overall, the NewsWizardlooks ready for testing in the pure makeup mode.andP;  As a layout terminal, usedfor laying out geometry and passing it back to the editorial front end, it isnot as ready.andP;  The layout features are all there.andP;  It is relatively easy todummy a story and quickly lay out a complete page.andP;  What is missing is thelink to the front end to have the editorial system compose copy to fit thesenews layouts.andM;The plan from here is to have the NewsWizard ready for beta testing inJanuary in Baltimore.andP;  We believe that as a standalone makeup device, itcould be ready to receive raw copy from a foreign front end (in this caseSII) by then, but full interactivity with the front end by January wouldrequire an exceptionaly effort over the next two months.andM;The bottom line is that Crosfield has made excellent progress on theNewsWizard's standalone functions.andP;  Now the tough job of integration with thefront end begins.andM;Datox builds around SunandM;The French systems company Datox has built its business largely on providingflexible approaches to customers' demands, such as interfacing its productsto specific databases.andP;  Through this approach, it has established itself asthe leading supplier of newspaper systems in its country.andM;At IFRA, Datox moved more toward the standard approach used by othercompanies, while still maintaining its commitment to support its customers'needs to interconnecting various systems.andP;  The new structure is built arounda Sun/Unix platform using Sun NFS networking over Ethernet.andP;  Datox is using aSybase database, which was being shown linked to a range of other Datoxsystems including editorial, page layout, text and graphics page assembly,plus programs for horse racing charts and stock exchange tables.andM;DDE shows its GMI systemandM;At last IFRA exhibitions, we have reported on the activities of the Danishsystem supplier GMI, whose systems were developed to run on hardware fromDansk Data Electronics (DDE).andP;  Since IFRA 1988, GMI has become a wholly owneddivision of DDE.andP;  (DDE, we are told, is the second biggest multiprocessorUnix system vendor in the world.)andM;GMI Data system is now referred to as the Euromax Professional PublishingSystem.andP;  It is probably the most complete Unix-based publishing systemavailable today.andP;  The Euromax software is designed to run on multiple 68020and 68030 servers using Unix System V.andP;  It can run with dumb Wyse terminalsor with PCs.andP;  It can also have linked DDE '386 or '486 PCs operating asdistributed servers or as workstation controllers.andM;In previous years, we have seen the Euromax editorial system, which impressedus as being functional and exceptionally fast.andP;  This year, it had an improvededitor that could run with codes, pop-up windows or both.andP;  It now supportsmulti-window text editing.andP;  Because of Euromax's Unix nature, multitaskingcan be handled through multiple windows.andP;  For example, directories areconstantly being built and updated on the screen in the same fashion as thenew CText system at the Chicago Tribune.andP;  The editorial system can be runeither with dumb terminals or with PCs.andM;Last year, we saw the Euromax display ad terminal for the first time.andP;  It wasbuilt around a direct onscreen use of the Chelgraph Ace language, and at thetime we termed it a Display Ace system.andP;  This year the system was running onthe DDE '386 PC and was supporting full PostScript as well as Ace.andM;The major new development we spent time with was the state-of-the-artclassified advertising system, which was being shown in its prototype form;it is scheduled for first installation at the start of 1990.andP;  It is builtaround a standard Informix relational database with an embedded SQL commandstructure.andP;  The benefits of this structure are that the user can expand thedatabase contents and can alter the layout, size and positioning of thedisplay and reports.andM;From what we saw, this appeared to be as flexible and customizable as anyclassified system we have yet seen.andP;  Of course, until it is finished we won'tbe able to compare it usefully to other systems.andP;  There is still work to bedone on output from the database and report generation.andP;  However, these aremainly database-related activities, so they should not change the userinterface significantly.andM;Substantial computer power is available to run the system with the DDEhardware, so there should be no performance problems, even in largeinstallations.andP;  The systems' design has many similarities to that of NDComtec (which is hardly surprising because a number of key DDE staff membersdesigning the product formerly worked for ND Comtec).andP;  It enables a user tocustomize all screen structures easily, defining where windows are to appear,what they will contain, what they should access, etc.andM;The user interface structure of the classified system is similar to that ofthe editorial system, where specific windows on the database can be openedanywhere at any time on the screen.andP;  GMI plans to use this interfacestructure elsewhere in the system.andM;We will be watching the further development and integration of this newclassified advertising system, plus other systems under development fromDDE/GMI.andP;  The systems' open architecture and its use of standard softwaretools make it one to watch.andM;Funkinform makes a ProFitandM;Another company that surprised us with the amount of development it had donesince we last saw it was Funkinform from Germany.andP;  This company began as thedistributor for the Xylogics (Dymo, Itek, etc.) CPS system and made its firstinstallation in 1976.andP;  When the fortunes of the CPS system started to sinkseveral years ago, Funkinform started developing CPS-compatible terminals tolink to existing systems.andP;  It later moved into developing a full replacementsystem.andM;We saw the start of this system two years ago.andP;  At IFRA we saw the completeworking product, which is called the ProFit system.andP;  Like many other Europeansystems, it is built around standard components: 68020-based Unix fileservers from the Cadmus division of Mannesmann, the Unify database andEthernet links; and PCs and Cadmus workstations.andM;Pagination is divided between PCs doing modular, area makeup using theProText program and Cadmus workstations making up complete pages usingProPage.andP;  ProText operators can start with layouts created in ProPage or useshapes created within ProText, building articles to fit these desired shapes.andO;The layout can be created using Funkinform's UserSoft planning and formattinglanguage.andM;Within ProText, a page preview shows the makeup of the page in diagrammaticalform.andP;  The operator can move rapidly between the editing and the layoutscreens as the cursor tracks nicely between the screens.andP;  The speed ofcreating a complex shape and fitting the text to it, complete with columnbalancing and vertical justification, is very good.andM;Within ProText on the PC, the user is limited to working with a singlearticle at a time.andP;  To make up complete pages, one uses the Cadmusworkstation running ProPage.andM;ProPage allows both layout-driven and interactive pagination.andP;  The screendisplays a full WYSIWYG layout, but it can't be edited directly.andP;  To edittext, an MS-DOS window is opened on the Cadmus workstation, enabling fullediting using ProText software.andP;  The article can then be put back on theWYSIWYG page.andP;  Articles can be aligned by restricting their movement tohorizontal or vertical directions independently.andP;  Currently there are nodrawing tools for defining the layout and flowing copy into it.andP;  This featureis currently under development.andM;The Unify database is used for classified advertising.andP;  The same PC terminalis used, but with a programmable screen layout for ad entry.andM;Ad-Page.andP;  The final system we saw was Ad-Page, a PC-based system for placingdisplay and classified advertising.andP;  Display ads can be placed first, withclassifieds fitting around them later.andP;  Specific ads can be lifted and movedto other locations, and columns can be aligned and vertically justified.andP;  Adscan be flowed to defined column formats or placed interactively.andP;  Searchfunctions can find an ad of a specific size to fit a space.andP;  Ads can beflowed from the top or bottom of columns, or jumped from one column or pageto another.andM;The final element of a Funkinform system that we still have to see is testand graphics integration.andP;  This is promised by Drupa.andM;GB Techniques has GAS graphics packageandM;In addition to the items already shown at ANPA, GB Techniques introduced agraphics package developed by Graphic Arts Solutions, its distributor inFrance and Belgium.andP;  It is built around a number of PC graphics packages,mainly Corel Draw and Astral Picture Publisher.andP;  GB intends to introduce amajor development of its Mentor system at the Newstec exhibition in the UKthis month, so we will delay covering the graphics package until then.andM;GB also had news on the display ad front, which is covered later in thisissue.andM;Graphic Systems integrates with GBTandM;Graphic Systems, the French systems company, appeared on the stand ofMonotype, of which it is a wholly owned subsidiary.andP;  It was showing one ofMonotype's first efforts to bring together some of its acquisitions of thepast few years: the Monotype Integrated Publishing System (MIPS).andP;  Thiscomprised GB Techniques elements for the networking and routing structures,linked to Graphic Systems composition and page layout systems.andP;  Output was toa Graphic Systems Rasterset imagesetter (Chelgraph IBX 2000).andM;Hell has COSY enhancementsandM;This was Hell's first showing since it set up separate sales divisions,handling color systems through the Repro and Gravure Division and newspapersthrough the Information Processing Division (IPS).andP;  Within IPS, all theSiemens newspaper and publishing operations now come under the Hell umbrella.andM;At IFRA, we took our first look at the future structure of such systems inthe form of enhancements to the COSY systems.andP;  These still use as theirdatabase and central computer a Siemens mainframe running under the BS2000operating system, but there is a commitment to move to a total Unixarchitecture running on a Siemens Unix computer.andP;  (Siemens is one of theworld's largest suppliers of Unix computer systems.)andM;We saw the first of a new range of layout products connected into the COSYsystem running in a Unix environment--specifically, on the Siemens WS30workstation (Apollo 3000).andP;  These products were the PPS (Product PlanningSystem), PKS (classified and display advertising pagination system), and PLS(Product Layout System).andP;  All these products are developed using X Window andthe Diamon (Dialogue Monitor) software, an OSF Motif-compatible screensystem.andP;  All these products are built around the P database, which holdsgeometry and administration details.andM;PKS is a rule-driven page layout system for placing display advertising andthen flowing classified around it.andP;  It will show from 1 to 32 pages on thescreen.andP;  PLS is an editorial-driven page layout system, working on similarconcepts to Atex News Layout.andP;  PPS and PKS are currently in beta test, andPLS should go into beta at the start of 1990.andM;Within this concept, one can also use FrameMarker 2.0 as the interactiveWYSIWYG editor.andP;  A COSY file can be input into Frame, where it will beconverted into Frame format and siplayed on screen.andP;  It is possible also totake a Frame file into the COSY database, but it can't be edited on a COSYterminal because it is stored in Frame format.andM;The one element lacking in this new Hell COSY structure is a way to handleany color on a page.andP;  This gap is somewhat surprising considering Hell'smajor position in the color market.andP;  At present, there are no products withinthe Hell product structure that will enable color pages to be assembled.andO;This new P series structure, as well as the integration of Frame into COSY,should be available to customers by mid-1990.andM;Hell also showed the latest developments in its PostScript typesetter line(see printout).andM;Hyphen brings Mac linkandM;There were no dramatic changes to Hyphen's editorial system.andP;  Featureenhancements were evident in most of Hyphen's products, but nothing wascompletely new.andP;  What has changed in the product line is an abvious biastoward PostScript, not only as the predominant output language, but also as amechanism for integrating elements and images.andM;The Mac is also becoming part of Hyphen's world.andP;  A PICT2 internal format forimages has allowed it to incorporate and display Mac files on its Computron 7pagination system.andP;  It is also taking low-res image files from PC-basedsystems (such as Serif) and placing them as parts of pages.andP;  For productsthat cannot produce low-res images for Hyphen, it can take PostScript filesinto their system, rasterize them in software, and display them as low-resrasterized images.andM;Hyphen also brought its PostScript output devices, which are covered underoutput, and demonstrated the Serif display ad system, which we mention inthat section.andM;IBM: a presence and various rolesandM;IBM has begun to exhibit at more newspaper shows, including both ANPA andIFRA.andP;  The role it plays in newspaper systems is not as obvious as thispresence.andP;  To complicate matters futher, its role in Europe is different fromin the U.S.andP;  In fact, its role is slightly different in each country inEurope.andM;In the U.S., IBM is playing a big role behind the scenes.andP;  It is not veryvisible, but its clout is.andP;  We don't believe it is playing any significantrole in system development for newspapers.andM;The picture is quite different in Europe, where IBM is taking an active rolein pursuing newspapers directly.andP;  In some larger accounts, it is the systemintegrator.andP;  In these cases, it is integrating software and hardware fromvarious suppliers or cooperative partners (which sounds like DEC in theU.S.).andP;  These partners may differ from country to country.andM;Also different in each country and situation is they way in which IBM getsinvolved in newspaper accounts.andP;  It may be called in by its cooperativepartners, or its own salespeople may call on the newspaper directly.andM;In any event, IBM is now, more than at any time since the 1130 days, activein supplying newspapers with solutions, although many of these solutions aresoftware packages developed by third parties.andM;This was the case at IFRA, where IBM has several third-party vendors in itssmall booth.andP;  Products from Graphic Arts Solutions, LaserMaker and the MCCgroup were all being displayed there, showing the unity with IBM.andM;IEA reaps benefits of Drane brainandM;One of the more interesting locations at the show was the stand of the U.S.andO;firm Information Engineering Associates.andP;  Already one of the key developersof integrated sytems that provide an alterantive to the big vendors, IEAdemonstrated a variety of products from various sources.andP;  But just asinteresting as the products were the players.andP;  Particularly one player: DougDrane.andP;  Several (we counted three) of the companies exhibiting in this boothare currently being funded by Drane, confounder of Atex.andP;  Doug was on hand toshow his support for their efforts--including Information Engineering,Advanced Technical Solutions and Graphic Edge.andM;These companies appear to be making a good living, mostly at Atex's expense.andO;In general, they are doing things that Atex customers are looking for, butthat they can't get quickly enough--or cheap enough--from Atex.andM;Advanced Technical Solutions.andP;  One such product is from Advanced TechnicalSolutions, which has put together a clever package to give Atex users fullremote functionality for any application program from a remote PC.andP;  As wehave reported previously, it consists of a hardware board that plugs directlyinto the DEC backplane of an Atex system.andP;  Each board can communicate withany combination of four terminals, either PCs tied directly to the system orPCs communicating over phone lines.andM;Other than communication software, the product is clear of any applicationsprograms.andP;  It simply looks and acts like a local Atex terminal.andP;  Noapplication software is run in the PC itself; all the programs are run in theJ-11 or 11/34 host, just as they would be for any dumb Atex terminal.andP;  Thisallows the terminal to act as any Atex terminal would without regard to theapplication.andM;At the show, the ATS group logges into a local Dutch Atex customer,Percombinatie, and accessed directories, edited stories, handamp;j'ed files, and soforth.andP;  Anything you can do from an Atex terminal could be done from theshow.andP;  In fact, as it dialed into the Orlando paper 4,000 miles away, itperformed standard system manager queries and functions.andM;This product also lets the Atex customer add an unlimited number of remoteterminals to his CPU.andP;  If he has 24 ports on his system, he can now have 24remotes.andP;  Any combination of 24 local and remote terminals can beaccommodated.andP;  Remotes can be configured to communicate at speeds from 300baud to 38.4 kilobaud.andP;  Each of the four ports on the add-in DEC board can beindependently configured.andM;ATS supplies the program for the remote PC (you need an AT or '386 clone) andthe board.andP;  In fact, it appears that ATS is also getting into the business ofoffering maintenance service to Atex customers.andP;  But the new product leaveslittle to be concerned about--it is completely independent of the Atex systemand is non-threatening to the system stability.andM;Information Engineering and Graphic Edge.andP;  The host for the stand,Information Engineering, demonstrated its PC News Layout program with a fewenhancements.andP;  It is now cooperating with another Doug Drane-funded companycalled Graphic Edge, Inc.andP;  This company, an outgrowth of the formerScandinavin company Sim-X, is providing real-time imagecompression/decompression and halftoning for the PC News Layout product.andO;Essentially, pictures can now be scanned via a variety of source (currentlybrought in via a Xerox 7650 at 300 or 600 dpi), compressed with the newsoftware, cropped, sized, rotated and placed on pages of the layout program,and output to an imagesetter.andM;The high sampling rate on input appears to be no problem because of the highcompression rate (15-20:1).andP;  The data is encoded by an accelerator cardplugged into a standard AT bus.andP;  The board also provides low-res screenimages for placement on pages.andM;The same RIP is used to screen photos for output.andP;  At the show, it was alsobeing used to rasterize text (going out to a dump printer).andP;  However, it canbe used to RIP only the photos and send them out as EPS files, combined withstandard text components destined for a PostScript printer.andM;Much of the integration with the PC News Layout program is still rough aroundthe edges.andP;  These companies have just begun to cooperate.andP;  Much of the workthat takes a few steps today will be automated in the future.andP;  Rasterizing tothe screen is also planned to be speeded up.andP;  That process takes a while now,but the estimate for the future is about two seconds per image.andP;  In additionto the black-and-white photos being shown at IFRA, color is on thehorizon--beginning sometime next year.andM;Xyquest.andP;  The fourth presence in the booth was Xyquest, the company behindXyWrite.andP;  It was showing XyWrite IV, which we reviewed at the SeyboldConference.andM;Information Int'l scores big fax saleandM;Information International had little beyond what we saw at ANPA and at therecent Seybold Computer Publishing Exhibition.andP;  In the DocuPro product line,the output of Pii (Triple-I imagesetter driver code) is scheduled to beavailable by January 1990.andP;  The Leonardo graphic product will link to the AMSdisplay ad product to transfer images as V-bit data for use in ads.andP;  DocuProwill also output V-bit graphic format as part of the Pii code structure.andM;In terms of orders, the major news was Triple-i's first fax order since itmoved into the fax business at ANPA.andP;  This order is from The Independent inLondon for its forthcoming Sunday newspaper.andP;  It includes two 3750large-format scanners for scanning complete pages and for use as graphicscanners for newspaper images.andP;  These are connected into twin INPs (ImageNetwork Processors) with 6 GB of disk storage.andP;  There are also two 38002magesetters for output of complete pages at the London office.andP;  The systemwill link to a Ricoh Telepress network, and from there output will be toLinotronic 500 output units (Ricoh OEM facsimile recorders) at remoteprinting sites.andP;  There will be six remote sites, with 12 recorders in total.andO;The 3800 RIPs will be linked into the Ricoh network to eliminate output ofpages in London and to eliminate the page scanning operation.andM;The order also includes a Triple-I Graphics Editor running on Sun hardware.andO;Installation will take place in December; the new newspaper is scheduled togo live in January.andM;Linotype enhances 2000andM;Linotype, whose new Saturn Plus PostScript RIP is covered in our section onoutput, has enahced its 2000 system in several ways.andP;  It recently announcedits Wysiwyg 2000, a new facility for providing more interactive compositionthat makes the system more suitable for complex jobs with frequently changinglayouts.andP;  The same workstation can run Composition 2000 and Wysiwyg 2000software.andP;  A Composition 2000 workstation can be upgraded to a Wysiwyg 2000workstation by adding a 19&quot; monitor, an optional graphics tablet, a second70-MB disk with screen fonts, and a 68000 coprocessor for graphicsapplications.andP;  The system runs on a 286 PC.andP;  First customer shipments arescheduled for this month.andM;New is rotation of graphics and text in one-degree steps and spot-colorsepration.andP;  By Drupa there will be an Ethernet network for Wysiwyg 2000, butnot for Composition 2000.andP;  The system will also be able to handle EPSF imagesin the first quarter of 1990.andM;Other enhancements to Graphics 2000 workstations are increased contrastcontrols for graphic manipulation and software to ensure eact 1:1 imagesizing to compensate for irregularities generated by the scanner's zoom lens.andO;There are also new filters to posterize contones into line art.andP;  Graphics2000 images can be used with a Series 300 or 400 system via the newPostScript-Link.andM;Linotype reports that the Series 400 newspaper systems running on Primemincomputers are still selling well, and that 1989 has been an exceptionalyear for sales, mainly in Germany.andP;  (The fourth wave has been late arrivingin Germany.)andP;  There have been minor changes to the system.andP;  The Text PC isusing a '286 rather than an 8088 platform, and it now has a hard disk.andP;  Therehave also been enhancements to the Page Manager 410 (Harris 8900), supportingnetworking of up to 8 computers.andM;PostScript link for 300, 400.andP;  Linotype also unveiled--finally--a means ofoutputting PostScript graphics with pages of Linotype text on its Series 300and 400 systems.andP;  These are discussed under output.andM;Mediasystemen ports to MS-DOS, UnixandM;Mediasystemen is a small Dutch systems company owned by the Damiate newspapergroup.andP;  Its stand was always crowded.andP;  This was understandable, asMediasystemen offers one of the most complete, seamlessly integratednewspaper systems we have seen.andP;  The concepts of software portability and useof advanced development tools make it impressive, as do its architecture andintelligent incorporation of standard hardware and software.andM;When we lloked at this system last year, we stated that it looked like aconventional large-scale newspaper system except that it was built onmicrocomputers instead of minicomputers.andP;  In terms of functionality, theeditorial system we saw then was comparable to anything we had seen.andM;The product is unusual in that it ran on intelhs own 220 or 320 computersystems, under the Intel RMX operating system (as used within the ScitexWhisper computer).andP;  Linked to that were Mediasystemen's own terminals builtaround the Intel 80188 processor.andP;  A unique aspect of the system was itscommon development environment, which meant that the same applications couldbe run in a variety of locations such as the terminal, the file servers, orthe Memphis page makeup workstation.andP;  The RMX operating system enabled thedatabse to be distributed around the file servers transparently to the users.andM;This structure enabled very large configurations to be assembled with nochange in the system's organization.andP;  It allowed up to 16 file servers to beinterconnected, and up to 24 terminals to be connected to each file server.andO;For larger configurations, up to 16 such systems could be interconnected on awide area network.andM;The move to standards.andP;  Since last year, Mediasystemen has found that theworld does not consider RMX a standard operating system.andP;  (This same world issaying that VMS is not a standard operating system, and that DEC should useUnix instead.)andP;  Mediasystemen is moving some of the system of Unix, and otherparts to MS-DOS.andP;  It is also looking at OS/2.andP;  It may seem strange toconsider MS-DOS these days, but Mediasystemen has been through the sameevaluation as Dewar did in the U.S., and has decided that for terminal-basedapplications, MS-DOS (with Pharlap extenders to eliminate the 640K barrier)gives it a small but fast system, which is what is needed in a terminal, withthe capability of providing SQL links into a database.andM;For a relational database, Mediasystemen has decided to use Oracle, both forthe PC and for Unix.andP;  It will run Unix Oracle on either Sun Sparcstations orIntel 520 (80486) processors on the Ethernet network, and will access thedatabase via SQL using SQL Forms in the PC.andM;Most of the editor from the Mediasystemen terminal has been ported to the PCunder MS-DOS, as has the hyphenation and justification.andP;  Certain items thatare being tuned for performance, such as search and replace, are still to bemoved.andM;The PC will have the EGO customization system built in.andP;  This allows acustomer system manager to completely customize the system for key layouts,screen forms, etc.andP;  Once this has been done, the EGO data is compiled andthen runs as part of the system.andM;Mediasystemen is currently building a true Unix relational database,SQL-based classified system.andP;  Its current classified system is a relativelysmall one, allowing a maximum of 15 terminals.andP;  The new system, which hasbeen sold to a newspaper in Tublingen, Germany, is designed to handle manyterminals.andP;  This system uses Oracle release 6 (which we are told has majorspeed improvements), plus PCs as terminals.andP;  The software in the PC iswritten in SmallTalk, and it calls in Mediasystemen's Justif handamp;j system.andP;  Ithas a shell generating the SQL interface to Oracle.andM;Memphis pagination system.andP;  Last IFRA, we saw the first showing of theMemphis pagination system, which runs on any '386 PC with 4 MB of memory andwill soon run under MS-DOS with Pharlap.andP;  This port has been made possiblethrough the use of the Watcom C compiler that works with Pharlap.andM;The Memphis system is installed at three beta sites.andP;  It was being used atthe show to make up four pages of the Haarlems Dagblad newspaper (which isclaimed to be the oldest newspaper in the world).andP;  The newspaper's staff wasworking on the stand via a communication link to the paper.andM;Memphis uses exactly the same editor and handamp;j routines as are used in allother parts of the system, and it provides both layout-driven and interactivepagination.andP;  In layout-driven mode, the layouts can be accessed by anyterminal in the overall system, so copy can be written to exactly fit aspace.andP;  One has full file locking over the network when multiple Memphisterminals are in use.andP;  In interactive mode, one has full interactivecomposition to do fine tuning of the page.andP;  Every element in the Memphissystem has its own dialog box to control all of its attributes.andM;For graphics one can import either EPSF or TIFF files, and Mediasystemen isplanning to have a full database of PostScript graphics.andP;  It is also planningto run a full PostScript interpreter within Memphis.andM;One Dutch site will soon be using a Memphis system linked ot its Atex system.andO;Mediasystemen also plans to make Memphis into a shrink-wrapped paginationproduct that could be used by other vendors.andP;  It appears to be good enough tomake this opportunity attractive.andM;Miles 33 sharpens PENS, explores SPACEandM;In the U.S., Miles 33 is known for its commercial systems, which are nowrunning on Sun hardware.andP;  In the UK, it is known more and more for itsPC-based newspaper and magazine systems.andP;  IFRA was the first showing of itscomplete systems in Europe.andM;A Miles newspaper system comprises up to four separate elements: the PENSeditorial system, the SPACE classified system, the Studio page makeup system,and its recently acquired advertising dummy and planning system.andM;Pushing PENS.andP;  Miles has had increasing success with the PENS system and hasnumerous installations.andP;  The largest of these is one of the largest PC-onlynetworks in the world, a 220-PC editorial system with four file servers andsix Studio page makeup terminals handling a 56-page daily newspaper inAthens, Greece.andP;  It also handles four weekly newspapers and a range ofmagazines.andM;Since we last saw the PENS system, Miles has made major enhancements to it.andO;The editor is more XyWrite-like, with many single-key functions.andP;  Thespelling and hyphenation dictionary has been improved by the use ofMicrolytics' software instead of Borland's, and Miles will son implementMicrolytics' thesaurus.andP;  There is also now a loose line indicator wherewordspaces exceed the specified maximum.andM;A further new facility is a status information window that will reportinformation such as who has worked on a story.andP;  The ability to enter atagline for an article has been added to the directory structures.andP;  There area range of directory selection and sort criteria for selecting articles bylength, time created, date, etc.andM;PENS has evolved into a good editorial system, with excellent composition.andO;We have some criticism about the tools for building system formats, butotherwise it is looking increasingly strong.andM;Our first view of SPACE.andP;  IFRA was the first time we had seen Miles's newSPACE classified advertising system.andP;  It is installed at one site of 65terminals linked to dual '386 file servers running Novell Netware; we believethis is one of the world's largest PC classified systems.andM;The SPACE screen (a color monitor attached to a '286 PC) is divided intothree windows for customer, classification details and text.andP;  These can beentered in any order.andP;  One can have a wide range of default styles perclassification, and the operator seldom if ever needs to know any typesettingcodes.andP;  The system provides a wide range of facilities and continuousinformation to assist an operator in upselling an ad.andM;The terminal also has a preview mode that is much more interactive thanothers we have seen.andP;  While one cannot change the text while in preview mode,one can select any item in the ad, change its point size, typeface, etc., andinstantly see the effect.andP;  The preview uses Bitstream fonts.andP;  Thefunctionality of this preview is all many newspapers would need to handledisplay ads.andP;  The SPACE system also now has the same handamp;i routine as the PENSsystem.andM;In order to improve production functions, Miles has developed a separateserver, which it calls the distribution server, to handle all output of data.andO;This server analyze all the ad orders, creates the output schedules, handlesthe extraction and sorting and drives the output devices.andP;  By freeing thefile servers from many of these functions, it should improve systemperformance.andM;SPACE appears to be an impressive PC classified system.andP;  We plan to visit theLeicester Mercury newspaper in the UK to get a better idea of its operation.andO;We also will look at other items in the Miles system at Newstec, includingthe Studio page makeup system and the ad planning product.andP;  At Newstec, Milesplans to introduce an alternative pagination solution using Quark Xpress withXtensions.andM;Monigraaf adds more piecesandM;Monigraaf Ky is another company showing the trends in Europe--a trend formore localized systems.andP;  Worldwide companies are finding it more difficulteach day to keep their market share in small countries with specialrequirements and different languages.andP;  As the technology has become equallyavailable throughout the world, each country or region has found localsuppliers specializing in its requirements and doing an excellent job.andP;  (Thisis more true in the small and medium papers which dominate Europe than in thelarge metros.)andP;  Monigraaf from Finland is one such company.andM;Monigraaf is gradually adding all the pieces for a fully integrated newspapersystem.andP;  Last year, it added display ad makeup; this year, it introduced anad dummying/booking system.andP;  The system enables newspapers to book adsseveral years in advance and to place them manually on specific pages(allowing for paid position ads).andP;  Multiple pop-up menus and prompts make thebooking process easy to use.andP;  They are used to enter run dates, pricingschemes and structure, credit limits, billing addresses, discounts for ads oragencies, and so forth.andP;  The system also handles coop ads quite well, whereseveral people are involved in placing a single ad.andM;A good fixed style reporting capability is also part of the system.andP;  Classads can also be taken, but we didn't see the full functionality of sorting,dumping, etc., that is usually associated with liners.andM;Multicom: newspaper pages with AtariandM;Multicom is a small German company that has impressed us at previous Europeanexhibitions with its Atari-based magazine editorial system.andP;  The systemoffers layout-driven pagination and excellent performance.andP;  It is used by oneof Germany's biggest magazine publishers, Burda, which has 120 Atari Megasystems on a network.andP;  The file servers are backed-up PCs running Brodatanetwork software.andP;  The network is Ethernet.andM;At IFRA, Multicom showed the system being more suited to newspaper pagemakeup: in addition to layout-driven pagination, one can now interactivelyadjust the page as well.andP;  One can also define line work as part of thelayout, rather than having to input it as a text file.andP;  Blocks on a page canbe rotated, either as titles or as complete blocks.andP;  There is now a variablegrid structure, so one can change the page grid layout anywhere on a page.andM;Multicom announced its first major newspaper order.andP;  The largest Austriannewspaper, Kronen Zeitung, is installing a 120-Atari system to handle sevellocal newspapers.andP;  Kronen Zeitung is owned by the German group WAZ, one ofAtex's biggest customers.andP;  WAZ has also installed a small Multicom system ata magazine in Dusseldorf.andM;Mycro-Tek takes line to EuropeandM;For the most part, mycro-Tek brought nothing completely new to IFRA, althoughsome of the developments were being shown or talked about for the first timein Europe.andP;  These included Adwriter 2.2, which includes auto masking ofgraphics and user-configurable line screening of images, plus the ability tosave display ad files in PICT and EPS formats.andM;Not quite ready was the integration of DPS Typecraft's MasterPlanner programfor inputting ad reservations into the Mycro-Tek 4000 file server as thestarting point for news pagination.andP;  An Xtension to Quark Xpress will be usedas the pagination engine, as we have reported previously.andM;ND Comtec unveils Image DatabaseandM;ND Comtec showed additions to its system, particularly oriented around thehandling of graphics and the development of interfaces to the AppleMacintosh.andM;The first new product was the Image Database, which runs on the ND server buthas a Macintosh interface.andP;  Graphics can be held on the Macintosh.andP;  Thedatabase stores images in TIFF and EPS formats, and it is integrated with allsystem modules having any graphics access.andM;The access into the database is via ND Easylink.andP;  A Macintosh programprovides full access to the ND database as though it were a normal ND Comtecterminal.andP;  Images are stored in the database at three resolutions: high, lowand micro (thumbnails for finding files).andP;  With the MacSearch program, it ispossible to search for graphics using various criteria, which will bring themicro-resolution versions to the screen.andP;  Clicking on the required imagebrings in the low-resolution screen version.andM;To demonstrate the system, ND was linked with Canon to input and storestill-video images.andP;  (Canon's presence in the European still-video market ismuch stronger than Sony's.)andP;  The images were being brought into a Macintoshwith the Neotech image grabber.andM;AdManager.andP;  The new AdManager software handles the booking and placement ofdisplay ads.andP;  When one selects the publication date, up to 16 pages aredisplayed on the PC screen.andM;This system is linked into the PEP (Production, Editing and Planning)database.andP;  It indicates where color can be placed, and it will handle couponads, color spots, etc.andP;  Each page has a specific layout control table;placement rules can differ for each page.andM;Once the ad dummy has been created in AdManager, it can be taken as geometryand ad references into Nortext Page Designer.andP;  If the ad is made up in thesystem with either AdDesigner or AdCreator (Multi-Ad Creator), it is thenbrought into the page.andP;  AdDesigner, which is based upon Aldus PageMaker (asis PageDesigner), is more integrated into the overall system than isAdCreator.andP;  Both systems are supported for handling display ads.andM;Neasi-Weber's European debutandM;Making first European appearance, Neasi-Weber used space in the IBM booth.andO;It demonstrated AdMarc, the ad order entry system, and discussed Discus, thenew circulation package.andM;AdMarc, which has been a standard in the U.S., is now being tested to try toachieve the same thing in Europe.andP;  Neasi-Weber (via IBM) is installing itsfirst big order at Sijthoff Pers in Holland.andM;Although Neasi-Weber was in the IBM booth, we should point out that itssoftware runs on several other platforms, including DEC and Unisys.andM;The newest thing about the company was its senior vice president, MichaelBrier.andP;  Mike recently left his position as VP of sales at Crosfield and hasjoined Neasi-Weber in a similar capacity in charge of marketing and sales.andM;Sema shows Cerci, Cilas productsandM;The Sema Group, a French company with roots back to Cerci and Cilas Alcatel,brought one of the newest, most complete and integrated systems to IFRA.andP;  Theoverall product, called Solstice 2000, brings together in one, integratedsystem everything from editorial to photo capture and editing, to pagination.andO;It employes industry-standard components in most cases.andM;Most of the hardware is DEC-based, from file servers to workstations.andP;  Thedatabase resides on dual file servers (for security).andP;  The database isconnected to the rest of the application terminals via an Ethernet link.andO;Everything from scanners to PCs is connected on the same network.andM;Sema has acquired the rights to the Cilas Alcatel Imaging Department.andP;  Usinga Windows-based '286 with a high-res graphic card and showing 8 bits perpixel, it demonstrated the capturing, storing and captioning of photostransmitted via 35mm and hard-copy scanners.andP;  The PC has a 20-MB disk fortemporary storage of about 50 pictures.andP;  Captions are stored as ASCII files,which makes access and retrieval much faster and more flexible.andM;On the pagination side, Sema was showing a Vaxstation 3100 running under VMSfor news layout and makeup.andP;  The system can be used in a variety of ways.andO;One is to mark up stories in advance (as modular pieces) and use the pagemakeup terminal as a manual placement device.andP;  Markup can be done directly onthe terminal as well.andP;  Photos and cuts can be added to make up completepages.andM;Photos and other graphics can originate from the picture desk system or fromonline scanners.andP;  For the moment, only cropping and placement of photos ispermitted at the terminal; there are no sizing or tonal adjustments yet.andO;Live photos from Agence France-Presse were being placed onto pages duringimpressive demos.andM;Sema uses the Vaxstation's multiple windows to show typeset views ofarticles.andP;  The Page view is relatively small and difficult to use for readingtype.andP;  The soft typeset view gives a clear, WYSIWYG perspective of eachindividual article.andP;  Windows are also used for directories, raw text windows,and so forth.andP;  Pop-up windows are used to control the entire process.andP;  Fewkeyboard commands are used in the layout process.andM;The page makeup terminal is online to the PC front-end system.andP;  This allowsthe system to be used in a pure layout mode as well.andP;  Layouts or news-holedummies can be sketched on the screen.andP;  Copy can then be flowed into thesenews holes on the front end or directly at the terminal.andP;  On the front-endterminals, over and under messages tell the editors how well their copy fitsthe layout.andM;The classified ad and display ad order entry products were also demonstratedto show the integration of all pieces.andP;  Using a window environment, ads aretaken by filling in menus in multiple pop-up windows.andP;  Handamp;j and pricing takeplace directly within the terminal.andP;  Rate tables are supplied by the Vax.andO;The pricing algorithms are sophisticated enough to pick up aspects of the aditself.andP;  For example, ads that have borders are automatically pricedaccordingly.andM;The system also provides a preview (soft typeset) in WYSIWYG form offormatted or marked-up ads.andP;  The system has made excellent use of themultiple windows for prompts and aids to the user.andP;  These are very helpfulfor pricing adjustments and discounts.andP;  It also has good links between thedata fields.andP;  For example, the classification field provides formattinginformation for semi-display ads, giving the user options to select forportions of the ad, such as point size changes, bold or italic type, and logoinsertion.andM;The ad order entry system is also off to a pretty good start.andP;  However, itwas specifically designed for a Spanish customer (to his specs) and lacks thelevel of integration that the other portions of the system have.andM;The Sports Table program has been around for some time now, but has beenrefined and put onto the modern hardware.andP;  This is one of the easier and mostuser-friendly programs we have seen.andP;  The user simply fills in the results ofevents (soccer, tennis, etc.) and the program does the rest.andP;  It recalculatesthe standings, resorts them and prints them--all according to user-definablerules.andP;  This is where it differs from some other programs.andM;The user has a lot of freedom in setting up the tables--not only the form forprinting them, but also the rules that govern how the standings arecalculated.andP;  For example, if the rule for one football league states thatforfeits or wins are two points, and in another league they are one point,the program can handle it.andM;SII's INL moving, but not off RingandM;Most of the enhancements in the System Integrators booth were incrementalover what we have seen this summer.andP;  Nothing brand new--just progress towardits next step.andM;On the Interactive News Layout (INL) side of the business, SII now has sevenbeta sites, with Santa Rosa scheduled to be the first to go live.andP;  Believe itor not, Sports is the lucky department to make it work.andP;  The initial systemwill be a text-only implementation, sending text to an APS-6.andP;  Santa Rosa hasa Camex Breeze/SuperStreet as well, but the editorial department has decidedon Autologic for news text.andP;  So much for total integration.andM;INL is still running under the proprietary Ring operating system.andP;  The OS/2version isn't likely to appear until 1991.andP;  This is later than we expected,but SII would rather get the jump on its competition with workingfunctionality before moving to the eventual platform.andM;Along the way, SII is now displaying Digital Technology International displayads on the INL terminal.andP;  These are actually uneditable soft-typesetversions, but the y do give the editor an idea of other elements on thepage--which should be enough.andP;  This is accomplished by DTI providing its adsas a second TIFF file (in addition to an output/PostScript format of the ad).andO;One feature that is not there yet (which its chief rival Atex is pushing hardon) is the automatic placement of these display ads (reservations) based onthe IAL ad dummying package.andM;On the front-end side of the business, the DOS Coyote is the product gettingthe most attention.andP;  Running the Coyote editor in a pure DOS world, theconnections to the host have been improved and the functionality isapproaching the point where the use of Tandems as only the file server maysoon be a valid consideration.andP;  The DOS Coyote can be connected to the hostas a remote dial-up terminal, connected directly or connected via a LAN.andM;On the terminal, the user sees the same header and text fields as in theCoyote terminals.andP;  The editor running in the DOS environment has all thefeatures of the Coyote IV.andP;  In fact, SII is providing the ability to plug indifferent editors (such as XyWrite) if the customer chooses.andP;  All thisrequires is a minimum standard AT clone and 128K of RAM.andM;Operationally, the terminal works exactly like a Coyote.andP;  The user has anidentical login procedure, including password.andP;  Currently no local logincapability (needed in a pure remote or external subsystem) is available, butit sounds as if this is just around the corner.andP;  The user can be connectedonline via the login procedure or act as a disconnected remote terminal for aperiod of time.andP;  When he does connect to the Tandem host, he can send filesto the host in a batch mode.andP;  This process currently works for classifiedads, and it will soon be implemented for editorial files as well.andM;What is missing?andP;  Selective directories are not provided in the DOS world,but a full SQL access to the host Tandem database will be provided soon.andO;Standard basket and queue directories are currently provided.andP;  Also missingfrom the DOS product are composition and multiple screen capabilities.andM;SII wouldn't comment directly, but it appears that the DOS Coyote isgradually moving to the point where almost all (or at least all of theexpected) functionality of the system could be available remotely within theDOS environment.andP;  When this occurs, SII will be in a position to offer otherCPUs as file servers--mainly DOS units.andP;  Jim Lennane said this would neverhappen.andM;But as we reviewed the product, we were reminded that Jim is no longer in theSII picture.andM;Systepo focuses on newspaper adsandM;This is the first time we have come across the Finnish systems companySystepo.andP;  The major shareholder of this ten-year-old electronic dataprocessing organization is Kirjapaino Osakeyhto Kaleva, the fourth-largestFinnish newspaper group.andM;Systepo was showing two newspaper applications, Adix and Classix.andP;  Adix isfor booking all ads and laying out the ad dummy, and Classix is for handlingand composing classified ads.andM;Systepo is also developing a full range of integrated business applicationsfor newspapers: Nedix for newspaper design, Profix for accounting, Cobix forad control and billing, and Cirix for circulation management.andM;All of these systems use Oracle as the relational database running on DEC Vaxcomputers under VMS, although Systemo is planning to port them to run underInix or Ultrix.andP;  the user terminals are PCs running applications underMicrosoft Windows.andP;  Currently Adix, Classix and Profix are operational at 10sites in Finland.andM;Display ads.andP;  Adix is used for booking all ads, and for defining the locationof display ads.andP;  Booking is handled at present using multiple calendars.andP;  Theoperator defines a specific page number for an ad, or a logical page numberif only a section is defined.andP;  Also defined is whether color is in the ad.andO;The system does not yet handle coupon ads.andM;The user can look in detail at specific pages to adjust positions ifrequired, or look at thumbnails of the whole paper.andP;  Adix does notautomatically lay out the whole paper; and the operator must place each ad.andM;Output is in PostScript.andM;Classified ads.andP;  Classix, the classical ad system, uses an impressive andfast graphical user interface.andP;  The screen is split into four windows.andP;  Atthe left is the control and customer detail area, as well as the graphicaltoolbox for laying out the ad.andP;  In the center of the screen are two windows:the upper window is the text entry and editing window, the lower one is theselling aids and prompts window.andP;  At the right of the screen is the previewwindow showing the ad in made-up form.andM;The Classix system appeared to be very fast in its operation, and the abilityto try different formats to lay out and compose the text was good.andP;  Thecontrol information appeared somewhat limited for multiple insertion patternsover a range of newspapers; however, that is not a requirement in Finland.andO;It should be possible to modify the program to handle different structures.andM;Adix and Classix together make an interesting system, combining all thebooking layout and page planning into one package.andP;  Although a number ofitems were lacking, the structure looked flexible, and with the link intoOracle it ought to be customizable.andM;Talbot pagination 'hit of the show'andM;Talbot has always been innovative.andP;  To the best of our knowledge, it was thefirst company to develop a sophisticated Macintosh editorial system, a numberof which currently are installed in the UK, including a few with about 100terminals.andP;  Talbot also was the first company we know of to use AppleShare.andO;One of its major achievements was to build the editorial system and networksystem for Eddy Shah's national daily newspaper, The Post.andP;  The paper failed,but the Talbot system was one of the successes of this operation.andM;At IFRA, Talbot continued in this light with a fundamentally new approach tonewspaper pagination, which, if we had to pick a single highlight from theshow, would probably get that award.andM;Up to now there have been two main approaches to pagination, which could besummarized as the Atex method (layout-driven) and the Hastech method(interactive back-end).andP;  We have recently seen a number of systems thatcombine these methods.andP;  While Talbot offers both means of pagination in thesame terminal, it extends this to offer full multiuser concurrent pagination,where a number of subeditors can work on one page at the same time, with allchanges being displayed instantly on all screens.andP;  Full security ismaintained to each subeditor's article.andM;This system does not run on a full multiuser, multitasking operating systemas one would expect, but instead on standard Macintosh SE and II computers.andO;One of the fastest pagination systems we have seen, it links fully intoTalbot's NewsWrite editorial systems.andM;The system is an extension of the NewsWrite preview system that is anintegral part of the editorial system.andP;  NewsWrite provides two separatewindows--a text editing window and a preview window.andP;  One works in a normalediting mode with control codes, then requests a preview to show the articleas composed in an area.andP;  This display is almost instantaneous.andM;The new pagination system takes this function and allows multiple articles tobe combined on a page, where each one is a secure, separate item.andP;  It addsthe ability to have the page open on any number of screens, with all activitybeing seen on each screen as it happens (as other subeditors work on theircopy).andM;The process starts with access.andP;  The system's secret is the access structure,in which each person on the network is given an access level.andP;  When eacharticle is defined, it is allocated an access level to permit it to be moved,edited or viewed.andP;  The editor who designs the page has a high accessprivilege so that he or she can move a defined article, whereas a subeditoronly has editing access to work on the story in the defined area.andM;Pagination begins with building of the page plan in a manner similar to otherlayout-driven pagination systems.andP;  Styles can be assigned to each story inthe plan.andP;  Ads and images can be positioned.andP;  There is currently no interfaceto take geometry from any ad dummying system.andM;A subeditor or journalist can open an allocated space on any terminal.andO;Someone who is working on a story, rather than on a page, can use a standardMacintosh SE and can write the story to fit the layout.andP;  Unlike on mosteditorial systems, though, each reporter is seeing a full WYSIWYG preview ofthe made-up story.andM;Pages are held as a series of separate directories on the file server; theoperator can call up the page directories and see graphically the status ofany page.andM;The system lets a subeditor or editor have a range of windows and files openat one time (subject to access rights)--the page being worked on, the textediting window for the specific article, the directory window, the page andarticle locking window, and a window showing which elements are currently inuse.andM;Talbot's directory structure contains a wide range of criteria that can beused to search for suitable articles to fit a space.andM;Benefits.andP;  The system is impressively fast, enabling the closing of multiplepages in quick succession at deadlines.andP;  It also facilitates makinglast-minute changes by moving stories that have been made up, or by changingtheir styles.andP;  With the correct access, an operator can pick up a story andchange its location.andP;  If an article is deleted from the page, it returns toits original basket in the database.andP;  There is always only one version of anarticle being used, not multiple versions around the network.andM;For an editor, one of the most impressive uses of the system is to have open(and see exactly what is going on with) up to 16 pages on a screen at onetime.andP;  If necessary, the editor can work together with a subeditor orjournalist on a page, even if they are in separate offices.andM;Graphics.andP;  The system handles any form of Macintosh graphic.andP;  With contones,it can simulate screening; an operator can look at a contone image in detailand adjust the tonal curve to see the effect on the dot structure.andP;  Normallyonly a low-resolution version of the image is brought to the screen, but whenpart of the image is enlarged, the high-resolution part for that area is readin.andM;The user can lighten or darken an image, change screen angles, crop andscale.andP;  Scaling differs from the normal Macintosh convention in that it isproportional unless the shift key is held down, in which case it isanamorphic.andP;  With the cropping tool, it is possible to define the size andmove the picture within it, or crop the image to the required size.andP;  Thesystem can also bring in images or data from other Macintosh systems.andP;  Oneexample of this is display ads; examples were shown of linking with Multi-AdCreator.andM;Still to come.andP;  Several developments are being worked on.andP;  Handling of spotcolor should be completed by the end of the year.andP;  Color separation is aroundnine months away.andM;The system will shortly go into beta test at the Bournemouth Evening Echo,which has a 70-terminal Talbot editorial system and an Atex IAS advertisingsystem.andP;  The paper runs about 96 pages per day, with three editions with upto 12 change pages.andP;  We plan to visit Bournemouth to see if the system is asgood in practice as it appeared to be at IFRA.andM;Tele-Ekonomi's pagination, ad bookingandM;Tele-Ekonomi is the leading Swedish newspaper system developer and theScandinavian agent for Digital Technology International.andP;  It works with DTIand other DTI distributors to develop Macintosh systems.andM;The two main products Tele-Ekonomi has developed are a graphics system forhandling wire photo data and a classified advertising pagination system.andP;  Welooked at the pagination system at IFRA.andP;  This is currently in beta test at anumber of sites, the most interesting being the London Evening Standard,where it is linked to a 150-terminal PCS system.andM;In this system, each ad is brought in from the external system and converted(in justified form) into separate EPSF files, which are then flowed into thedefined page format.andP;  After flowing the page or pages, the operator can moveads to different positions to avoid paging conflicts.andP;  Once the page iscompleted, it is rasterized to build an output page, showing all the ads intheir final format, before being transferred to the output device.andM;The system appears to be reasonably fast, but during the flowing it onlyshows areas.andP;  One problem appeared to be that the user could not reach allthe desired information to identify specific ads for moving them.andM;Tele-Ekonomi also showed another system it has under development: the LineBooker, a program and WYSIWYG editor for booking lineage ads.andP;  It links intoa Hewlett-Packard database that Tele-Ekonomi uses for its current classifiedsystem, where a PC is the booking terminal.andP;  The Line Booker was too early inits development cycle for us to comment further.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
