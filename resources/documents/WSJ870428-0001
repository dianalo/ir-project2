Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater helped trigger the dollar's rebound shortly after noon EDT by reiterating an administration statement that a further fall in the currency's value would be harmful. At his daily briefing for reporters, Mr. Fitzwater read a statement saying the U.S. and its six biggest economic allies want to &quot;foster stability&quot; in exchange rates.    The dollar's recovery was seen as positive news by the stock and bond markets, which also skidded early in the day but then bounced back. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day off 4.83 points at 2230.54 after being down more than 40 points in the morning. Bond prices, which also plunged early in the day, rose as much as $5 for each $1,000 face amount.    Some currency traders, however, called yesterday's upturn in the dollar temporary and said further declines in the currency's value are likely.    As on many other recent days, the dollar began yesterday by falling like a rock. In early Tokyo trading, it plunged 1 1/2% against the Japanese yen from its level of late Friday in New York to reach a 39-year low of 137.25 yen. It then began a gradual recovery as speculators took profits by selling yen that had appreciated against the U.S. currency. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan intervened by buying the U.S. currency.    In subsequent European trading, there was more profit-taking in other currencies as well as dollar purchases by the central banks of West Germany, Britain and Switzerland.    In late New York trading, the dollar was back to 139.23 yen, only slightly off the Friday level of 139.38.    It performed similarly against major European currencies, falling sharply and then recovering. Against the West German currency, the dollar reached an intraday low of 1.7715 marks in Asia, then bounced back to stand at 1.7929 late in the day in New York, compared with 1.7845 Friday.    &quot;No one is taking this as . . . anything other than a temporary bottom for the dollar,&quot; Garrett R. Glass, vice president, foreign exchange, at First National Bank of Chicago, said. &quot;No one is buying (dollars) because they want to be long for any period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;They're buying because they want to take profits,&quot; he said.    In early Tokyo trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 139.05 yen.    The White House's statement persuaded many traders to cover any short, or oversold, dollar positions outstanding. In response to a question at the briefing, Mr. Fitzwater read a statement referring to the U.S. and its partners in a recent currency-stabilization accord -- Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. It said: &quot;We all believe a further decline in the dollar could be counterproductive to our efforts. We all want to see stability. That's the position of the administration.&quot;    Before reading the statement, Mr. Fitzwater took the unusual step of telling reporters that he was simply repeating a position outlined Friday by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker.    Earlier, President Reagan had generated speculation about the administration's position on the value of the dollar. In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Reagan referred to exchange rates only briefly but in a manner that seemed to suggest he might favor a further fall in the currency's value. He listed steps the administration has taken to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and said, &quot;The change in the dollar's value is part of it.&quot;    In any case, some traders remained skeptical about the administration's policy yesterday and still suspected a weaker dollar might be sought. Frank Pusateri, a trader at Bank of Boston, called the White House statement &quot;window dressing&quot; to make Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to Washington this week &quot;more palatable.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery plunged $19.40 an ounce to $443.50 in very heavy trading. Estimated volume was 11 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $449 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Monday, April 27, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
