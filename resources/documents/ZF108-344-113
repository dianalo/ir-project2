Jay Stevens of Dean Witter expects net tobe flat in the first half but to turn around to come in at $9.75 a share forthe year, against 1989's $6.47 after charges.andM;- o -andM;The General Accounting Office's decision that Apple Computer Inc's Macintoshmay not meet all the stated requirements for the US Air Force's workstationcontract (CI No 1,360) relates to doubts about its multi-tasking capability:the ruling was in response to a protest by Martin Marietta Corp, which bidSun Microsystems workstations on the contract against the Macs bid by winnerHoneywell Inc; the Office is recommending that the Air Force reopen biddingfor the contract.andM;- o -andM;Delta Air Lines is to merge its Datas II reservation system with Trans WorldAirlines' PARS system, which is now equally-owned with Northwest Airlines:Delta will get a 33.3% stake in return for Datas II and will then pay TWA$48m for another 6.7%, valuing the combined business at about $716m andleaving Delta with 40%, Northwest with 33.33% and Trans World with 26.67%.andM;- o -andM;Phoenix Technologies Ltd's chairman and vice-chairman have resigned and NeilColvin, formerly chairman, has been named senior vice-president and chieftechnical officer of the Norwood, Massachusetts IBM-compatible personalcomputer BIOS specialist: Colvin will concentrate his efforts on the researchof advanced technologies and potential new products; Ron Fisher, namedpresident and chief executive on January 29, was also appointed to the board.andM;- o -andM;Sanyo Electric Co is to do development work on high definition television atits Sanyo Spain SA unit.andM;- o -andM;Hewlett-Packard Co and Oki Electric Industrial Co have firmed up theiragreement to build and jointly operate a printed-circuit-board manufacturingfacility in Puerto Rico: the partners have begun securing construction andoperating permits from the Puerto Rican government, and will invest $40m toconstruct a 115,000 square foot plant at Hewlett's site in Aguadilla;Hewlett's Puerto Rico operation will use the boards in its computer productsand Oki's share of output of the personal computer boards will be sold on theopen market; construction for the 50-50 venture is scheduled to be completedsometime in 1991.andM;- o -andM;Thomson-CSF SA is calling the defence electronics interests it bought lastyear from Philips NV Thomson-TRT Defense.andM;- o -andM;News of the killing to be made from leveraged buyout and break-up ofcompanies with strong cash flow has reached Sweden, where a buyout bid foroffice supplies company and computer distributor Esselte AB is expected anyday: the shares were suspended on Monday, but the threat of break-up will befiercely resisted by the trades union-nominated employee directors on theboard.andM;- o -andM;GEC Plessey Telecommunications will harmonise ISDX networking with that ofSiemens' Hicom and Rolm PABXs.andM;- o -andM;Apricot Computer Systems Division has appointed the Novell distributorSkytech Ltd as a value added distributor for its VX FTserver, Qi and XEN-Sserver and personal workstation series: Skytech distributes Novell's NetWareand will supply this with Apricot hardware; the agreement comes after Novelland Compaq Computer Corp announced plans to develop fault-tolerantcapabilities for local area networks using Compaq's multi-processingtechnology (CI No 1,360), and suggestions that Microsoft's new LAN Manager 2kits, developed by Compaq, don't have any multi-processing capabilities.andM;- o -andM;IBM researchers have astonished themselves by running a computer simulationof the brain and finding that it produced electrical waves resembling thosein the brain itself, holding out the hope of much more advanced simulationsof brain activity than was previously possible: in particular the work couldshed light on epilepsy and on the formation of memories, because thesimulation was of the activity of the hippocampus, the area of the brainwhere those activities occur; the work by IBM scientist Roger Traub andColumbia University researchers Richard Miles and Robert K S Wong - imitatedthe activity of a slice of a guinea pig's hippocampus containing 10,000 cells- still tiny in comparison with the millions making up a human hippocampus;the 3090 with Vectors fitted required several hours of computation to producea few seconds' simulation.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories researchers have confirmed the existence of apreviously unacknowledged form of matter called quasi-crystals, whichcontains a puzzling, pentagon-shaped symmetry in its arrangement of atoms:the Aluminium-Cobalt-Copper quasicrystals fall between amorphous andcrystalline materials and have the hardness of quartz; electrically, they areunaffected by changes in their temperature.andM;- o -andM;GEC Plessey Telecommunications Ltd has a #1.3m order for 5,000 single linebase stations and ConcepT 2000 CT2 cordless telephone handsets from Oy HeltelAB of Helsinki, Finland, for installation in businesses and homes: theequipment is designed to the emerging Common Air Interface signallingstandard.andM;- o -andM;Clarification: Dixons Group Plc retains its Mastercare after-sales serviceoperation, but has sold the division's computer installation and maintenancearm (CI No 1,360).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
