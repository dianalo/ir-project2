Franklin Williams</BYLINE><DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A person born during the year 1900 couldexpect to live to be 50 years old. Today, a person's life expectancyat birth is 75 years, a full generation longer. Why are peopleliving longer? What do these extra years mean to the individual, tothe family, to society?   How long a person lives depends on several factors: genetics,medical advances, lifestyle, and environmental assaults.   Science and medicine have given us antibiotics, vaccines andbetter medical care so that illnesses once fatal no longer are.People are more aware than ever of changes in lifestyle that affecthealth: eating a well-balanced diet that limits fats and fiber,exercising sensibly, wearing seat belts, quitting smoking, anddrinking little, if any, alcohol, have all contributed to longer,healthier lives. Governmental regulations have eliminated manyconcerns about the food we eat, the water we drink and the air webreathe.   Some 20 or 30 years ago, people believed that getting old meantan inevitable decline of health and intellectual function. In fact,many medical textbooks still use the word ``senile'' to describepeople who suffer confusion and memory loss and imply that thiscondition is a natural consequence of age.   Today, thanks to studies on normal human aging, we know thatpeople can live to be 100 and more with no evidence of heart diseaseor memory impairment. Scientists also have concluded thatpersonality does not change with age. In fact, there are few, ifany, changes that occur to all people as they grow old.   Despite these results, there are many people for whom aging is nojoy. I recently met a woman in her mid-70s who confided, ``No oneever told me that growing old hurts so much.'' Many older peoplebecome dependent on family members and society because ofdebilitating conditions that severely restrict their independence.Arthritis, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease, to name a few, areproblems for which science and society have not yet found adequatesolutions. A person should be able to remain functional and vigorousthroughout life.   As director of the National Institute on Aging at the NationalInstitutes of Health, I am all too frequently asked, ``Is this whatI have to look forward to as I grow old?'' Studies that help us tounderstand and eliminate the afflictions that rob a person ofindependence are a high priority among researchers around the world.   Make no mistake, we have made progress. For example, we have theexpertise to treat certain forms of urinary incontinence, we haveidentified the risk factors that make falls and subsequent fractureslikely, and we understand the benefits of early rehabilitation afterstroke.   Because of these and other successes, many children today knowtheir grandparents, and even their great grandparents. In manycases, grandparents are an integral part of the family and arecalled upon to lend support to the family unit. This is all verypositive. However, new problems arise as many grown children arecalled upon to care for a frail parent or relative. For many, thecaregiving role is fraught with doubts, guilt, tedium and fears, andindeed is an area which requires innovative approaches to best serveall concerned.   To society, the implications of the growing number of olderpeople is still confusing. Many healthy older people do not chooseretirement. They wish to remain employed. Health-care systems do notyet know how to respond to the growing number of people who requirelong-term care. Health professionals and policymakers need to sortout the ramifications of having so many older people in need ofassistance.   From the day you are born you begin to age. No matter how old youare, aging issues apply. I hope this information will serve toeliminate some of the common fears many of us have about growing old.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for June 29</NOTE></DOC>
