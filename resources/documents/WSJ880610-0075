<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880610-0075 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: Penn Central Corp. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> PC </CO><TEXT>   Penn Central Corp., Cincinnati, said a unit, General Cable, has formed a joint venture in fiber-optic cable with Furukawa Electric Co., Tokyo.    The new company, Fitel General Inc., will be a combination of General Cable's domestic Fiber Optics division and Furukawa's U.S. unit, Fitel Corp., Penn Central said. Furukawa will have a majority of the stock, Penn Central said, but declined to state the specific percentage.    General Cable's fiber-optics manufacturing equipment will be transferred to Fitel's facility in Carrollton, Ga., expanding that unit's capacity. Akira Yamamoto, Fitel president, was named president and chief executive officer of Fitel General.    General Cable is an international maker of electrical and telephone cables and was a pioneer in fiber-optical cable development. Furukawa is a large cable and nonferrous metals company, with six subsidiary companies in the U.S. But each has only a small share of the U.S. fiber-optical cable market. Penn Central estimated that the new company will have less than 5% of the market. </TEXT></DOC>
