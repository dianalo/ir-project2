More prime-rate increases are likely this year as a result of the Fed's efforts to restrain inflation pressures by slowing the economy's torrid growth pace, economists said. &quot;The rate rise has quite a long ways to go,&quot; said Gordon Pye, chief economist at Irving Trust Co. &quot;We're in the last phase of an economic expansion that could go on for at least another year or two.&quot;    Meantime, &quot;I don't think we're at the point where we could say we're in a crunch and interest rates have gotten to a level where they're hurting people,&quot; added Mr. Pye, who predicted another half-to-full percentage point increase in the prime by year's end. &quot;Rising interest rates are a symptom of prosperity,&quot; said Neal M. Soss, chief economist and managing director at First Boston Corp.    The latest prime increase, which was led by Chase Manhattan Bank, was the third by banks this year. It is now at its highest level since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5% from 10%. The prime, or base rate, is a benchmark for determining fixed-rate and adjustable-rate lending, particularly on mortgages, home-equity loans and some corporate loans. Chemical Bank, for instance, said it was raising all adjustable-rate loans by an eighth of a percentage point, including one-year loans to 8% from 7 7/8%.    The latest increase was sparked by the Fed's decision Tuesday to raise its discount rate, or the lending fee it charges banks and other financial institutions, to 6 1/2% from 6%. Since then, the rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend one another overnight, climbed above 8% from just under 7 3/4% -- prompting banks to increase their own lending rates at the wholesale and retail level.    Banks typically maintain a margin of at least 1.15 percentage points between the prime and their own cost of funds, reflected in 90-day certificates of deposit, said Mr. Pye of Irving Trust. The rate on 90-day CDs surged to 8.45% from 8.05% last week, and when banks include the cost of federal deposit insurance and their reserve requirements, that real cost hovered at about 8.90%. Obviously, &quot;banks weren't keeping their traditional margins with a prime at 9.5%,&quot; he said.    Prime-rate moves typically lag changes of almost all market-related interest rates, including Treasury bills, bank CDs and federal funds. As a result, the prime's rise and fall rarely has a dramatic impact on stock or bond prices, which were little changed in quiet trading yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 5.16 points higher at 2039.30. Prices of actively traded long-term government bonds fell less than one-quarter point, or just under $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Rates on some Treasury bills and other money-market instruments rose as much as 0.1 percentage point, in line with the increase in the federal funds rate.    In addition to Chase Manhattan, other major banks raising their prime rates were: Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust Co., First National Bank of Chicago, Continental Illinois National Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Wells Fargo Bank and Security Pacific National Bank. </TEXT></DOC>
