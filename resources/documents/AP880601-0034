The sources, who spoke Tuesday, gave credence to reports that adeal had been struck between a guerrilla commander and theKremlin's army allowing Soviet soldiers to leave Afghanistan ifthey do so peacefully.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also reportedrumors of an imminent military coup in Kabul and said the Sovietshave been giving the Afghan army more sophisticated gear thanbefore.   The gear includes Soviet-built AN-12 transports, jets comparableto the U.S. Turbo-prop C-130 Hercules, large bombs, infrarednightsighting devices for small arms and new radar equipment.   The anti-communist guerrillas are apparently also getting theirshare of top-notch weaponry.   Official Afghan television showed pictures of a new long-rangerocket captured south of the city. The rocket has a range of about12 miles and is believed to come from the United States.   Washington, while acknowledging it supplies the guerrillas,rarely discloses details of arms shipments. China and Pakistan alsoarm the guerrillas.   Meanwhile, the insurgents were reported to have stepped uprocket attacks on Kabul, a possible indication they are gettingstronger and drawing nearer to Afghanistan's center of power.   Diplomats citing dispatches from the capital said 14 rocketsslammed into the city, mainly into its western and southerndistricts, from May 23-30. That was the heaviest missile attack onKabul in any week this year.   Several Western military analysts, all speaking on condition ofanonymity, say guerrillas are now operating within six to 12 milesof Kabul, which is on a plain ringed by hills.   On Tuesday, the Soviet withdrawal continued as Red Army troopsevacuated towns south of Kabul in their second major retreat fromAfghan outposts.   Western and Soviet diplomatic sources in Kabul said Soviettroops left Ghazni, 85 miles southwest of Kabul, and Gardez, 60miles south of Kabul, and were heading north toward the Sovietborder.   The evacuation of Soviet troops from the area leaves the Afghanarmy largely unassisted, at least on the ground, against attacks byanti-government guerrillas in the provinces separating Kabul fromthe Pakistani border to the south and southeast.   On Tuesday, the guerrillas said from their headquarters inPakistan that they captured the strategic Panjshir Valley northeastof Kabul last Thursday. Diplomats in Islamabad supported the claim.   The Salang highway, the major Soviet withdrawal route, runsthrough the valley, but the insurgents say they are letting the RedArmy pass without attacking.   Recent reports said the guerrilla commander Ahmed Shah Masoodmade a deal with the Soviet military to leave its troops alone ifthey retreat peacefully.   Masood has made such deals in the past, but only at a price.   It is not known what concessions he may have extracted from theSoviets.   The Soviet withdrawal started May 15 with departure of troopsfrom Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul.   Under an April agreement signed in Geneva, the Soviets are tocomplete their withdrawal by Feb. 15, 1989. When the pullout began,the Soviets had an estimated 115,000 soldiers in Afghanistan. About10,000 have left so far, according to reports from Moscow.   The Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan began inDecember 1979 when troops were dispatched to prop up a Soviet-stylegovernment in the face of escalating guerrilla attacks.   Sources in Pakistan said speculation has been rife about apossible military coup when President Najib leaves the country for10 days beginning Saturday.   Najib will be going to Moscow and is also scheduled to speak atthe United Nations in New York.   Speculation focuses on the Khalq faction of the governingPeople's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The faction dominates thepolice and military. Najib's Parcham wing also is split in two: hissupporters and those of former leader Babrak Karmal.</TEXT></DOC>
