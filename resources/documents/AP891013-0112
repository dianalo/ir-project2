(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man once charged with stranglinghis wife lost temporary custody of his two young daughters Fridaywhen a judge ruled him an unfit father.   Circuit Judge Brandt Chase Downey III said Jeffrey Crouchrefuses to deal with a drug and alcohol problem and cited the``lingering thoughts'' that would remain in his daughters' mindsover whether Crouch really killed their mother.   Crouch left a courtroom in tears, denying he killed his wife andvowing to appeal the custody decision.   ``Somebody took my wife and now they took my daughters away. Iwill appeal, and I will get my daughters back,'' he said. ``Whyshould I live the rest of my life without my daughters?''   Crouch, 33, spent 17 months in jail on a first-degree murdercharge in the January 1987 strangulation of his wife, Jean HelenCrouch. Her body was found on a remote beach after a night out withher husband.   The murder charge was dismissed in June 1988 by a judge whoruled police detectives had coerced a taped confession from Crouchand the confession could not be used as evidence against him.   No one else has been arrested in the case. Crouch claims he lastsaw his wife alive the night of Jan. 27, 1987, when the two lefttheir daughters with a baby sitter and went to a nightclub. He saidshe disappeared when he went to get her coat.   Temporary custody of Jessica Lee Crouch, 4, and Juline AnnaCrouch, 7, was awarded to their mother's sister, Judith Riha ofPlymouth, Mass. She was appointed their guardian shortly after the1987 strangulation.   The question of permanent custody of the children is to bedecided later.   ``It is the opinion of this court that Crouch's drug and alcoholabuse, his inability to be truthful, his denial of any problems inthe parenting area and in the drug abuse area and thus his lack ofaddressing these problems through counseling are clear andconvincing proof that he is an unfit parent at this time,'' saidCircuit Judge Brandt Chase Downey III.   ``The stigma of a confession and the lingering thoughts thatCrouch might have killed Helen would be ever-present in the girls'mind and thus prohibit them from ever trusting him or even gettingclose to him,'' Downey said.   Crouch began a legal battle for his daughters after his releasefrom jail.   Downey prohibited unsupervised visits between Crouch and thegirls in Florida but allowed supervised visits in Massachusetts.   Crouch and the judge said the older girl expressed mixedfeelings of wanting to return to her father but not wanting toleave her aunt.   ``She was very much pulled and torn, kind of like I was,''Downey said.</TEXT></DOC>
