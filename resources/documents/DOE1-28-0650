The presence of pure monophasic material was confirmedby x-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Comparisonof the material made with a slight excess of the rare-earth oxide toa sample prepared using a slight excess of Rh{sub 2}O{sub 3} showed thatthe excess Rh{sub 2}O{sub 3} cannot be removed by leaching. These studiesdemonstrate the need for careful attention to the synthetic method usedfor the preparation of solid-state materials which are to be evaluatedas catalysts, and the utility of XPS studies of LaRhO{sub 3} have shownthat, contrary to claims in the literature, no stable Rh{sup +} speciesare observed on heating his material in pure H{sub 2} or 1:1 H{sub 2}:CO,although in the latter case some stabilization of the original perovskiteis observed vs reduction in pure H{sub 2}. The activity of LaRhO{sub3} as a catalyst for the formation of linear alcohols from syn gas (i.e.,1:1 H{sub 2}:CO), as well as for ethylene hydroformylation, is also reported.The results imply that oxygenate formation occurs on Rh{sup 0} centersand that the temperature-dependent competition between associative anddissociative CO adsorption on Rh{sup 0} is the major factor in selectivitydistributions.</TEXT></DOC>
