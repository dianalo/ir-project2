Berger and Siegfried K. Wiedmann, and atPhilips Research Laboratories in the Netherlands, lead byCornelius M. 'Kees' Hart and Arie Slob.andP;  The methods of the twoteams were virtually diametrically opposed, one team following alogical line of research and the other an intuitive idea.andO;Integrated injection logic briefly revitalized bipolar technology,but interest in it has now lapsed because of the popularity ofbipolar complementary metal oxide semiconductor (BiCMOS) circuits.andO;The development of integrated injection logic technology isdescribed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Philips Research Laboratories (research)International Business Machines Corp.
