 Their main concern is determining the technical differencesbetween the two developing versions of UNIX.andP;  For systems integrators,it-doesn't matter which side OEMs are taking but, rather, which UNIX versionwill best suit applications requirements.andM;By now, the two major combatants are more than familiar.andP;  On one side, wehave UNIX System V Release 4.0.andP;  This Release is being developed by ATandamp;T Co.andO;and Sun Microsystems Inc., with input from their fellow UNIX Internationalmembers.andP;  System V.4 combines the three major strains of UNIX: System V, 4.3BSD and XENIX.andM;On the other side, we have OSF/1 and its champion, the OSF.andP;  OSF/1 is basedon IBM Corp.'s Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX) version of UNIX.andM;ATandamp;T plans to release beta source code versions of V.4 for its 3B2 computersthis summer.andP;  Binary code for V.4, as well as applications binary interfaces(ABIs), are due in the fourth quarter.andP;  Likewise, the OSF has promisedinitial releases of OSF/1 by year's end.andM;Despite the posturing, the two UNIXes are surprisingly similar.andP;  As one groupadds functions, the other group is likely to follow suit.andM;Moreover, both versions of UNIX will comply with the same industry standards,including IEEE POSIX, the X/Open Co.andP;  Ltd.andP;  Common Applications Environment(CAE), System V Interface Definition (SVID) and the ANSI X3J11 C languagespecifications.andM;User interfaceandM;The most visible differences between UNIX System V.4 and OSF/1 will be theuser interfaces.andP;  System V.4 sports the Open Look user interface, which isbased on Sun's SunView and the X Window System.andM;OSF/1 will use a combination of Digital Equipment Corp.'s DECwindows, whichis based on the X Window System, and IBM-Microsoft Corp.'s OS/2 PresentationManager.andP;  The OSF's user interface, called OSF/Motif, is part of theuser-environment component (UEC); Motif is due this summer.andM;OSF/Motif will have the look and feel of Microsoft Windows and PresentationManager but will use the application programming interface and XUI (X userinterface) toolkit of DECwindows.andP;  The interface also incorporates a 3-Dfeature developed by Hewlett-Packard Co.andP;  DEC and HP are jointly developingMotif.andM;Significantly, in addition to bundling Motif with OSF/1, the OSF willunbundle Motif for inclusion with other operating systems, most notablySystem V.4.andM;Some systems integrators think that Motif gives OSF an advantage in userinterfaces.andP;  Many people are familiar with the windowing concepts on PCs;thus, these people know more about Motif than about Open Look.andP;  In addition,there is a large installed base of DEC equipment and, therefore, manysoftware developers familiar with DECwindows.andP;  According to the OSF, portingDECwindows applications to Motif requires minor code changes.andM;Furthermore, the XUI toolkit that comes with OSF's user interface, which iswhat applications developers write to, has already been ported to a number ofenvironments and can be ported to other environments with relative ease.andM;Tack on MotifandM;&quot;The majority of applications developers will adopt OSF/Motif,&quot; predicts JohnLogan, executive vice president at the Boston-based The Aberdeen Group, anindependent market research and consulting firm.andP;  However, Logan adds, &quot;Theadoption of Motif isn't dependent on the operating system.andP;  In other words,developers could license V.4 and tack on Motif.&quot;andM;On the down side, OSF/Motif is a hybrid.andP;  &quot;I was discouraged to see that UECwasn't a pure product,&quot; says Charles Watkins, a product planner at TexasInstruments Inc.andP;  &quot;It disturbs me to see a trend toward hybridization.&quot;andO;However, TI, a member of both the OSF and UNIX International, reports thatits users and resellers are more concerned with the environment on dumbterminals in multiuser configurations than with windowing schemes andadvanced user interfaces.andM;It's debatable how important the choice of user interfaces will be.andP;  Mostsoftware developers, for example, are more concerned with the availability ofdevelopment tools than with a specific OEM-implemented user interface.andP;  And,in any case, most major software vendors plan to layer their products on allpopular interfaces.andP;  As a result, the user-interface issue isn't ofparticular interest to many OEMs and end-users.andM;However, not all participants agree that the choice of user interfaces istrivial.andP;  Mitch Bishop, director of UNIX product marketing at database vendorRelational Technology Inc., says, &quot;The decision of which UNIX version to gowith will be made at the user-interface level.andP;  As a developer, once you getbelow the user-interface level, the two versions are so similar in functionthat it's really a wash.&quot;andM;As do most major DBMS vendors, Relational Technology belongs to both OSF andUNIX International.andM;In comparing the technical differences between the two UNIX versions,distributed file systems is one area of particular interest to systemsintegrators.andP;  System V.4 will support both the remote file system (RFS),developed by ATandamp;T and already included in System V.3, and the network filesystem (NFS), developed by Sun.andM;Largely because it's included with System V.3, by far the dominant version ofUNIX, RFS is widely used.andP;  However, RFS is primarily used in homogeneous(e.g., UNIX-to-UNIX) connections.andP;  Systems integrators prefer NFS forheterogeneous connections.andM;At press time, the OSF had not officially adopted a specific approach todistributed file systems.andP;  However, the front-runner was the networkcomputing system (NCS), which was developed by Apollo Computer Inc. and islicensed by DEC, HP and IBM--the triumvirate of the OSF group.andP;  NCS allowsdevelopers to distribute parts of a single application across a multivendornetwork.andM;NetworkingandM;Some OEMs think that NCS has some inherent technical advantages.andP;  Forexample, Michael Fowler, manager of systems software at Data General Corp.andO;compares the three major approaches to distributed file systems, &quot;NCSprovides a much better stateless connection between systems if you're tryingto implement sophisticated set-ups like client-server computing.&quot;andM;Data General plans to support both System V.4 and OSF/1, as well as NFS, RFSand NCS.andP;  Even if the OSF doesn't adopt NCS, it's possible for vendors toimplement NCS on top of V.4.andP;  to satisfy their customers' needs.andM;When technically comparing the two UNIX versions, at least innetwork-intensive environments, systems integrators should consider whichtype of programming interface is preferable for a given application (seeMini-Micro Systems, February, Page 62).andP;  Currently, most UNIX-based networkapplications use the sockets interface, as defined in the Berkeley, or BSD,UNIX version.andP;  The transport level interface (TLI) developed by ATandamp;T, andincluded in System V.3, is a major alternative to sockets.andM;System V.4 will support both the sockets interface and TLI, as well as theATandamp;T-developed streams I/O mechanism for implementing network protocols.andO;OSF/1 will support the sockets interface but, because it's based on AIX,which in turn is based on System V.2, it's unlikely that the initial versionof OSF/1 will support TLI or streams.andP;  Reportedly, OSF is consideringsupporting streams, but it's more likely that the organization will come upwith an alternative mechanism.andM;The choice of network programming interfaces isn't likely to cause muchconsternation among systems integrators in environments not heavily dependenton networking.andP;  However, for some companies, supporting both approaches iskey.andP;  &quot;Supporting both sockets and streams is important to our client base,&quot;says Bob Van Valzah, project manager at Lachman Associates Inc., aconsulting, software and systems integration company that is a member of boththe OSF and UNIX International.andM;On the positive side, most OEMs will eventually offer both sockets and TLI ontop of streams, regardless of which source code version of UNIX they adopt.andM;Real timeandM;The current lack of support for real-time computing (see Mini-Micro Systems,March, Page 46) concerns systems integrators evaluating the two developingUNIX versions.andP;  Both System V.4 and OSF/1 will offer support for real-timeprocessing, but their degree of support will probably differ.andM;Because it's based on AIX, OSF/1 will support real-time processing via afully preemptible, or reentrant, kernel.andP;  ATandamp;T reports that V.4 will supportreal-time processing by adding preemption points to the kernel.andP;  Generally, afully preemptible kernel provides a higher degree of real-time response anddeterminism.andP;  In addition, a fully preemptible kernel makes it easier todevelop real-time applications.andM;However, the two groups' approach to real-time processing probably won'tmatter to systems integrators.andP;  OEMs and software developers, the companiesthat systems integrators buy from, will continue to rewrite or modify thecore kernel or operating system to provide the desired level of real-timeresponse.andM;For example, Concurrent Computer Corp. bundles a real-time version of UNIXcalled RTU (Real Time UNIX) with its Masscomp line of hardware platforms.andO;The company plans to support both System V.4 and OSF/1 but doubts that eitherversion's approach to real-time processing will be sufficient for demandingapplications.andM;Concurrent's Bill Blundon, director of product marketing, says, &quot;The problemwe have with any proposed approach to date is that, particularly in thereal-time world, there's a real need for multiple processors.andP;  Neither grouphas attacked that problem, so we'll have to build on top of any standard.&quot;andM;However, building on top of standards raises questions about compatibilityand portability.andP;  In the case of Concurrent, Boundon says, &quot;The company's RTUwill be compatible with both UNIX versions at the interface level.andP;  Eachcompany licenses an operating system, then adds value depending on theirtarget markets and customer requirements.andP;  That situation won't change withthe introduction of V.4 and OSF/1; we'll be much closer to true portability,but we still won't have shrink-wrapped software.&quot;andM;Support for multiprocessingandM;Blundon's comments raise an issue that is important to systems integratorsaddressing high-end applications: the lack of full support formultiprocessing in either System V.4 or OSF/1.andP;  Both ATandamp;T and the OSF haveannounced plans to provide built-in multiprocessing support, but initialreleases of V.4 and OSF/1 will have only rudimentary multiprocessingfeatures.andM;Meanwhile, companies such as Data General have redesigned the System V kernelto support symmetric multiprocessing on emerging architectures.andO;Compatibility and portability are issues, just as in real-time support, whenredesigning a standard kernel.andM;Compatibility is directly related to portability, which comes on two levels.andO;OEMs who aren't committed to either UNIX version are more concerned aboutoperating-system portability.andP;  In other words, will the tape from ATandamp;T or OSFrun on any platform?andP;  Systems integrators and end-users, on the other hand,will be more concerned about application portability.andM;Database supportandM;Another troubling aspect of both System V.4 and OSF/1 for software developersis the lack of embedded support for databases, which generally refers toembedded SQL (structured query language) for the C programming language.andP;  OSFexpects to issue a request for technology (RFT) before year's end, butneither V.4 nor the initial release of OSF/1 will provide database support.andO;&quot;You're looking at least at 1990, maybe later, for embedded databasesupport,&quot; says Relational Technology's Bishop.andM;John Kornatowski, president of Empress Software Inc., another vendor of UNIXDBMSes, puts the database support horizon even further off.andP;  He says, &quot;Itwill be two to three years for a preliminary set of primitives.&quot;andM;Ideally, database software developers need a consistentapplication-programming interface across all UNIX versions.andP;  A standard APIwould allow programmers to develop front-end applications that couldinterface to any back-end DBMS.andP;  Currently, each major DBMS vendor has aproprietary API, resulting in little portability across the various DBMSes.andM;Of course, it's practically impossible to achieve binary portability acrossall processor architectures.andP;  As a result, some database vendors likeInformix Software Inc. think that the industry should focus on the DBMSelements being standardized by ANSI and X/Open, such as SQL.andP;  Roger Sippl,chairman of Informix, says, &quot;X/Open is the arbiter and gluing mechanism forsingle standards for source-code compatibility among multivendor UNIXmachines.&quot;andM;Other considerationsandM;Systems integrators should consider some routine but critical concerns whenevaluating the two UNIX versions.andP;  For example, integrators interested inease of use should check the system administration facilities of each UNIXversion.andP;  System administration--the day-to-day functions such as bringingthe machine up, shutting it down, prohibiting access to certain files,managing disk space and setting up network connections-will differ in eachUNIX version.andP;  The relative ease of use in the system-administrationfunctions may help integrators decide if an on-site, high-priced UNIX expertis required.andM;Integrators are concerned with security, particularly those working with thefederal government.andP;  The government has established ratings based on thedegree of security offered by a given operating system.andP;  The ratings rangefrom A (high) to D (low).andP;  Most current UNIX versions have a C rating.andP;  Atthis point, however, it's premature to speculate on the level of securityATandamp;T-Sun or OSF will offer.andM;As the OSF's plans become clearer, there are other points of comparison toconsider.andP;  For examples, internationalization (V.4 reportedly will solve mostof System v's problems in this area); memory management (V.4 will supportmapped files, but the OSF's plans are unclear); and virtual-memoryimplementations, which will probably differ at the hardware level.andM;Swift raceandM;Although end-users aren't likely to choose a UNIX version based on technicalmerits, systems integrators and uncommitted OEMs will be scrutinizing thedifferences over the next few months.andM;&quot;Systems integrators and application developers will support whateveroperating system their hardware supplier is betting on,&quot; says The AberdeenGroup's Logan.andP;  &quot;I expect most software developers to be in the OSF camp,because that's where they have the ability to move their products across thewidest range of platforms.&quot;andM;Ross Summers, product manager for operating systems at Sequent ComputerSystems Inc., says, &quot;It's not so much a battle as a buffet.andP;  We might licensetechnology from both groups.&quot;andP;  That strategy is typical of many OEMs,regardless of which UNIX organizations they belong to.andM;Most likely, there won't be a single winner; each group will add features asusers demand them.andP;  The UNIX versions will look more and more alike,particularly as they start coming in line with emerging POSIX and X/Openstandards.andP;  &quot;We feel that standards, such as POSIX and X/Open, are moreimportant to our users,&quot; says Summers.andP;  &quot;The efforts of the OSF and UNIXInternational are less important today.&quot;andM;Moreover, OEMs have already implemented in their own UNIX versions manyenhancements that the OSF and UNIX International are working on.andP;  &quot;We don'tthink that the UNIX evolution will be driven by one or two standards,&quot; saysData General's Fowler.andP;  &quot;It'll be driven by the marketplace and user demand.&quot;andM;In the end, however, the winner will be the group that gets to market quickerand establishes a large installed base.andP;  ATandamp;T and the OSF have promisedgeneral releases of their UNIX versions before year's end.andP;  However,operating-system development is often plagued with bumpy roll outs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
