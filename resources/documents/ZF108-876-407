(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Flexible faxingandM;If I had to nominate one aspect of modern business that has never quite madeit in the PC world, it must be the sending and receiving of fax messages.andO;The main promise of most PC fax boards is 'background operation', but whenthe driver software eats up over 180Kb of base memory, all too often PCscan't run any other worthwhile programs and you're left with a ratherexpensive conventional fax facility.andP;  The Panasonic fax looks interestingbecause it claims to need only 64Kb of memory for the resident software.andM;The hardware part of the package deserves a few honourable mentions -- BTapproval really says it all and, hopefully, ensures that it does actuallysend and receive!andP;  The 8-bit, full-length board is 9600bps Group 3-compatibleand sports a BT line cord and a socket for a standard phone.andM;The most outstanding (literally!) feature is an LED module which plugs on tothe board and provides an external indication of what's happening -- send,receive, errors and so on.andP;  The unit has a magnetic base and so can be stuckon the top or side of most metal system units, but should be kept away fromcolour screens and floppy disks, for obvious reasons!andP;  The final mention goesto why this board only occupies the minimum of base memory; it comes with itsown 80188 microprocessor with 256Kb of on-board RAM which controls most ofthe card's functions, freeing as much PC memory as possible for other tasks.andM;The host software consists of a couple of device drivers and a four-optionmenu-driven program: send, receive, polling and utilities.andP;  There shouldreally be six main options because hidden amongst the utilities are afull-blown graphics-based editor and the dialling directory.andP;  These reallycry out to be options from the main menu rather than tucked away out ofsight.andM;Sending was fairly straightforward.andP;  Pick the text and graphics to be sent,choose to send the fax immediately, or queue it for later transmission whenBT reduces the call charges, then either key in a number or select one fromthe dialling directory and off it goes.andM;This is where the shine started to rub off the whole thing -- everything Isent to the test fax on another line was blank.andP;  Checking the manual, Idiscovered that claims of text support for most of the popular wordprocessing packages were accurate, but, with a big proviso; forget any ideasabout fancy fonts, bold headings, italics, underlining and the like, onlystraight text and tabs are allowed.andP;  All other enhancements are stripped outor, worse, the text isn't sent!andP;  Receiving was great -- left unattended inbackground mode, one of the LEDs on the external module blinks to reportwaiting incoming mail and loading the fax software enables them to be viewed,stored, edited or printed.andM;The system can't print transparently in background mode, but if the menusoftware is left running it can be, although, obviously, it ties up themachine.andP;  The fax editor is a full copy of Z-Soft's Publisher's Paintbrush,including scanner support, with a few Panasonic-specific modifications; faxesare stored in a special format with all pages in a contiguous file.andO;Individual pages can be called up and saved in standard, PCX format ifdesired.andM;The dialling directory editor was a bit quirky -- straight numbers were easyto enter, recall and edit, but setting up groups (so that one keypress sendsa fax to your whole mailing list, for example) was a bit clumsy.andM;The remainder of the options are concerned with polling, general housekeepingtasks and diagnostics.andM;As to the promise of sensible background operation, with all the residentsoftware loaded, I could run WordPerfect 5.0, Splash! and a whole host ofother memory-hungry programs, including PageMaker and Excel under Windows,and the board still worked.andP;  The software did balk at the full version ofWindows 386, but managed to run under the reduced Win86 variant.andM;Overall, Panasonic has come close to achieving the ultimate PC fax board but,as usual, the software rather lets the product down in a few areas.andM;My wish list for the next version would include: a general tidy-up of themenu-driven software and a Windows version of same; better support for properword processing formats including text enhancements such as bold andunderlining; optional pop-up utilities as well as the conventionalmenu-driven interface; a tidier phone directory with the ability to importnames and numbers from ASCII files so that I could simply extract therelevant information from a customer database and avoid manually typing in2,000 entries and, finally, a user-programmable front-end so that it'spossible to interface directly with the fax machine (a sort of fax-Hayescommand set).andP;  If Panasonic could manage to get these points fixed, I'd giveit full marks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
