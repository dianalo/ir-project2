The three-year battle to get the landmark legislation throughCongress marks only the beginning of a bigger fight to make surethat the law is fully utilized, supporters contend.   To that end, lobbying organizations for both business and laborgroups are briefing their members on the details of the 1,000-pagebill, which President Reagan signed into law on Aug. 23.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has prepared a detailed guide toacquaint business leaders with a law that Chamber President RichardLesher calls a ``turning point in U.S. economic history.'' Inaddition, the chamber is preparing a videotape and will offerseminars both in the United States and abroad.   ``We have prepared a very extensive program to inform U.S. andforeign businesses of the impact of this legislation on currentoperations and its implications for long-range planning,'' Leshersaid.   The chamber and many other business groups opposed the tradebill as it was first passed, objecting to a provision that wouldhave required companies to give workers advanced notice of masslayoffs and plant closings.   Reagan vetoed the original trade law primarily because of theplant closing section but reversed course later and allowed aseparate bill with just the layoffs and plant-closing legislationto become law without his signature.   The chamber's guide seeks to explain the complex trade law inlaymen's language and at the same time explode what the businessgroup believes are myths about the legislation.   ``There has been an enormous amount of misunderstanding aboutwhat this trade bill is,'' said William T. Archey, the chamber'stop trade expert. He blamed this on the fact that the legislationtook three years to emerge from Congress with much of the earlyattention focused on heavily protectionist provisions that werejettisoned from the final product.   ``I think those who would argue that it is protectionist shouldbe required to read it first,'' Archey said.   But private economists still worry about provisions, made lessstringent in the final version of the bill, that will make iteasier for the United States to impose import curbs in retaliationfor alleged unfair trading practices by other nations. They contendthat this could prompt other countries to retaliate by raisingbarriers against U.S. products.   Earlier drafts of the measure contained langauge that would havegiven the president no discretion in retaliating against unfairtrade practices by countries running large surpluses with theUnited States, such as Japan.   Private economists note that foreign reaction to the greaterpossibility of import curbs has been overwhelmingly negative fromboth the Far East and Europe.   ``We have made a lot of people overseas mad and there is alwaysthe risk that they will react negatively to the pressure we areapplying to get them to open up their markets,'' said David Wyss,of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass. economic forecastingfirm.   Since the legislation gives the president a large amount ofleeway in deciding whether to retaliate, both presidentialcandidates are being watched carefully for clues on how they wouldhandle the new law.   ``The law by itself is not going to solve the trade problem. Butit provides the tools to an executive who wants to address theproblem forcefully,'' said Mark Anderson, an economist with theAFL-CIO.   Anderson said that Vice President George Bush would likelycontinue the free-trade emphasis of the Reagan years whileDemocratic nominee Michael Dukakis has pledged a more forcefulattack on the country's huge trade deficits. The AFL-CIO hasendorsed Dukakis.   Other economists agreed that Dukakis would be more activist ontrade matters than Bush, but they said that even a Democraticadministration would not utilize the full powers of the legislationfor fear of retaliation.   ``Both of these candidates are basically internationalists.Dukakis would be tougher than Bush, but I don't think the risk of atrade war is that great because I don't think Dukakis is going topush the bill to its limit,'' Wyss said.   The first sign of the new administration's intention is likelyto come next April when the legislation requires the U.S. traderepresentative, an appointee of the president, to produce a list oftargeted countries along with a plan for negotiations aimed atremoving trade barriers.   Countries with large surpluses such as Japan, West Germany andKorea are likely candidates to be on the list.   Long before then, however, the trade law should have a positiveimpact on exports of such high-technology equipment as computers.The law substantially reduces licensing requirements for theseexports.   While the original rules were designed to preventdefense-related equipment from falling into the hands of the SovietUnion or its allies, supporters of the change contended thatAmerican businesses were losing $9.3 billion annually in salesbecause of unnecessary licensing requirements. The change isexpected to eliminate the need for more than 25,000 export licensesa year on products deemed to be of little use militarily.</TEXT></DOC>
