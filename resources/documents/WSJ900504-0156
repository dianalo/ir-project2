Three out of four Americans believe they could more thandouble the amount of waste they presently recycle, comparedwith just 40% who thought so last July, according to a pollreleased yesterday by the National Solid Wastes ManagementAssociation, a Washington, D.C., trade group.</LP><TEXT>   Only 11% of the U.S.'s 160 million tons a year ofmunicipal solid waste is currently recycled, and even thatmuch is straining municipal officials, who must find somebodyto buy all those old newspapers, glass bottles, aluminum cansand plastic containers.   Nevertheless, 74% of those polled in March believe theycould beat the federal Environmental Protection Agency'slong-term goal of recycling 25% of the U.S.'s municipal solidwaste. And one in four said they could recycle as much asthree-fourths of everything they now throw out, compared withjust one in 10 who thought so last summer.   To be sure, the public's sharply growing commitment torecycling is already reflected in some states' recyclinggoals. California and Iowa want to recycle 50% of theirgarbage by the year 2000. New York wants to hit 50% by 1997,Washington state by 1995 and Maine by 1994.   But while there aren't yet enough new products and marketsto absorb the growing amount of recycled items beingcollected by communities, experts attending the wasteassociation's annual convention here agreed that U.S.manufacturers are going to be under increased public pressureto use more recycled raw material in the goods they produce.The industries most likely to be affected, the experts said,are plastics, paper, glass, rubber, aluminum, metals and oil.   The good news for manufacturers is that, &quot;The public isprepared to pay more&quot; for those goods if they contain a lotof recycled material, said Allen Moore, president of thewaste association.   Newspaper and magazine publishers will be especiallyaffected, according to a study that was also releasedyesterday by the association. The study found that while U.S.newspapers contained only about 9% recycled fiber in 1988,they will have 16% by 1992, 25% by 1995 and 40% by the year2000 -- in part because of a proliferation of stateregulations requiring more recycled-fiber content innewspapers.   Moreover, the study noted that in order for publishers toget the quality of newsprint they need, old magazine fiberwill have to be blended with old newspaper fiber, meaningthat, before long, Americans can expect to start puttingtheir magazines at the curb as well.   The poll also found that public opposition to garbageincinerators continues to lessen. Indeed, more than half ofthose polled (55%) said they wouldn't object to anincinerator being built in their community, compared with 44%who didn't object last summer, and only 39% in February 1989.   Even landfills got a bit more public support this timearound. Some 36% of those polled said they wouldn't object toa new landfill in their community, compared with just 23% whodidn't object last summer and 30% in February 1989. A solid59% majority, however, said they would still object, withonly 5% holding no opinion.</TEXT></DOC>
