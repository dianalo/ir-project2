The special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair has asked U.S.District Judge Gerhard Gesell to impose a prison term on the45-year-old retired Marine lieutenant colonel on the grounds that helied and showed no remorse at his trial.   Lawyers for the former national security aide who quarterbackedthe sale of arms to Iran in 1985 and diverted the profits to theNicaraguan contra rebels replied that it would be ``cruel andunjust'' to incarcerate North.   North was convicted on three felony counts and acquitted on nineothers, including a charge that he lied to Congress _ something headmitted in testimony.   His convictions were for aiding the obstruction of Congressthrough helping to construct a false chronology of the affair, fordestroying sensitive government documents and for accepting a$13,800 home security system from arms dealer Richard V. Secord, whois awaiting trial on Iran-Contra charges.   Defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said in court papersearlier this week that the prosecution's request for imprisonment``demonstrates that it will stop at nothing in its effort to crushOliver North,'' and that sending him to prison would only encouragehigh government officials to let subordinates take the blame for``legally or politically risky'' ventures.   During six days of testimony at the trial, North said he acted atthe direction of his superiors, including then-President Reagan.   Since his conviction, he has continued to appear on the lecturecircuit, reportedly being paid $25,000 an appearance.</TEXT></DOC>
