Following Wednesday's cutoff of oil, Soviet authoritiesslashed deliveries of gas to Lithuania about 80% yesterday,leaving barely enough flowing to enable people to heat theirhomes and cook. The republic's own main source of power, theIgnalina nuclear power plant, has meanwhile been shut for&quot;repairs.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Lithuanian leaders set up a commission to overseerationing, and warned people to expect a &quot;starvation diet.&quot;Government spokesman Ceslovas Jursenas issued an appeal onthe republic's radio urging Lithuanians &quot;to use mostthriftily these resources that we have, in industry, inagriculture and in everday life.&quot; But the republic so far isshowing no sign of backing away from its March 11 declarationof independence, which sparked the current crisis.   In the first official statement, read on the main eveningtelevision news, the Kremlin said it imposed the economicsanctions because Lithuania had failed to give a&quot;constructive response&quot; to Moscow's demands. Mr. Gorbachevand Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov said a week ago that anembargo would be imposed unless Lithuania rescinded lawspassed since the independence declaration that violate theSoviet Constitution.   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman sharply criticizedwhat he described as &quot;a mounting propaganda campaign&quot; in theU.S. over developments in Lithuania. The spokesman, VadimPerfilyev, said the U.S. reaction, &quot;can no longer beexplained by a natural desire to understand complicatedprocesses under way in another country.&quot; But he stressed hewas talking about media and other reaction, and wasn'treferring to the Bush administration.   But Mr. Bush and the Western allies continued to avoidretaliatory sanctions on Moscow over its crackdown inLithuania. The president said yesterday that sanctionswouldn't be imposed without extensive consultations with theallies.   His &quot;reluctance,&quot; the president said at a news conferencewith French President Francois Mitterrand in Florida, &quot;stemsfrom trying to keep open a dialogue and discussion thataffects many, many countries. And I am talking about armscontrol. I am talking about solidifying the democracies inEastern Europe. I am talking about a lot of matters whereU.S.-Soviet relations affect a lot of other countries.&quot;   Mr. Bush and the U.S. allies seemed eager to avoid anyaction that would affect Soviet cooperation on armsreduction, a new security arrangement for Eastern Europe, andGerman reunification. The first priority, said a militaryspecialist at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is toavoid causing new troubles for a beleaguered Mr. Gorbachev.&quot;There's a surprising degree of consensus on this,&quot; thediplomat said.   Lithuania's economy is likely to feel the effects of theembargo very soon. The country's gas supply has been reducedto 3.5 million cubic meters a day, less than one-quarter ofusual consumption. And Lithuania's big Mazeikiai oil refineryhas already been forced to work at considerably reducedcapacity. The Ministry of Chemical and Oil-ProcessingIndustry in Moscow said the refinery now has barely enoughstocks to continue functioning for four to five days more.   Lithuanian officials had contended that a shutdown of therefinery would punish others by halting supplies of crucialpetroleum products from Mazeikiai to other Baltic states andsome East European nations. But Moscow's State Committee forMaterial and Technical Supplies said that neighboringrepublics and foreign countries won't be hurt because theywill receive supplies from refineries in Russia, Byelorussiaand the Ukraine that have additional capacity.   Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, spentthe day in Norway, holding exploratory talks with officialsabout receiving other sources of oil. She will also visitDenmark. So far, however, she appears to have received only alukewarm reception.   As he steps up the economic pressure, Mr. Gorbachev isalso making strenuous new political efforts to persuade itstwo Baltic neighbors not to follow Lithuania's lead.   At a one-hour meeting in the Kremlin yesterday, the Sovietpresident surprised Latvian leaders by offering the republica &quot;special status&quot; within the U.S.S.R. if it agreed not toset out on the path of independence. Unlike Lithuania andEstonia, the republic hasn't yet declared its independence,although the issue will be discussed when the parliamentmeets next month.   Latvian officials said Mr. Gorbachev didn't give precisedetails, but he hinted that the republic could become a typeof special economic zone. He offered to start talks on bothpolitical and economic issues and, for the first time, raisedthe important question of the republic's legal status.   Along with Lithuania and Estonia, Latvia was forciblyincorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 following a secretagreement between Hitler and Stalin that the U.S.S.R.parliament has now deemed illegal. The issue is important foractivists in all three Baltic republics, who say that theyaren't seeking to secede from the U.S.S.R., but merely toregain the former independence that Moscow illegally tookaway.   Following his meeting with the Latvians, Mr. Gorbachevalso held two hours of talks with Estonian leaders. He againwarned them to rescind &quot;anti-constitutional acts&quot; taken bythe Estonian parliament, which has proclaimed its aim ofindependence after an interim period and suspended theU.S.S.R. Constitution on its territory.   An Estonian news service quoted the republic's president,Arnold Ruutel, as saying, &quot;We need calm reasoning&quot; and thatthe republic's parliament should decide on what to do next.</TEXT></DOC>
