The 2{omega}/subce/ surface is now extended everywhere in the second stage except theextraction part. Thus, a strong flux of deconfined plasma is availableat the extraction area and therefore high currents of high charge stateions are extracted. Optimum rf power is increased by a factor of 3 withrespect to the single {omega}/sub ce/ profile and currents of high chargestate ions are increased by a factor of 10. The optimum performance forall gases and all solid elements is shown. The third step of the metamorphosisis planned for next year to achieve and work with two complete ECR surfaces.Future developments are also expected. (orig./HSI).</TEXT></DOC>
