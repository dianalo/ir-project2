House and Senate conferees dropped a provision in the Senate tax bill that would have imposed economic sanctions against Iraq. It would have banned sales of weapons to Iraq and instructed U.S. officials to vote against loans to Iraq in international financial institutions. House tax conferees didn't want to accept a measure unrelated to taxes.    Last week, the House passed separate legislation that contained the sanctions against Iraq. But the objections of several lawmakers to other parts of the measure prevented it from being considered in the Senate before Congress adjourned early Saturday.    Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.) called defeat of the sanctions &quot;almost a tragedy&quot; and promised to raise the issue again next year. </TEXT></DOC>
