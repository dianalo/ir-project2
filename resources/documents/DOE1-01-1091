Therefore, the conditions of development are: (1) A device shouldbe able to be manually transported in order to make a measurement ata point where a car traffic is possible. (2) Quality control of the dataobtained should be fully possible. (3) Highly dense measurement shouldbe possible to match the complicated geological structure. More concretelysaying; (a) Measuring device: Weight of the measuring part must be lessthan 25 kgs per unit. Data transmission distance should be above 5 km.An optical fiber is ideal for a transmission path. (b) Data processingtechnique: It is necessary to develop a device which enables to judgethe correctness while obtaining the data to check the accuracy of thedata. (c) Analytical technique: To develop a quasi-3-dimensional modelanalytical technique which involves a two-dimensional forward analysis,and a two-dimensional inverse analysis. (d) Economy: Cost of survey perone measuring-point is to be reduced less than half of the current cost.(3 figs, 3 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
