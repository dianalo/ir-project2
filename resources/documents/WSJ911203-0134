Every Canadian is.&quot;It's a sense of security we've always had. I don't worryabout medical bills,&quot; says Alexa's father, Gary Howard.</LP><TEXT>   The mother and father are sitting on twin beds in a cheeryroom at the Royal Victoria Hospital, where they both stayedovernight. Her blanket is pink, his blanket is blue. Alexa issound asleep in a bassinet between them. Bouquets of flowersline the windowsill. First-time parents, the Howards say theRoyal Vic is treating them well. &quot;We're going to go homefeeling good,&quot; Mr. Howard says.   Across the hall, Ruth and Jeremiah Wheeler are stillmarveling at the Canadian health-care system. They moved herefrom San Diego a year ago. &quot;I'm surprised by how personal thecare is,&quot; says Mrs. Wheeler. &quot;Here you have the feeling youget the same quality care as everybody else. In the U.S.,doctors have this look pay my fee, and then I'll look afteryou,&quot; Mr. Wheeler says. In San Diego, the birth of their sonNathan Daniel would have been a financial strain, say theWheelers, also first-time parents. &quot;We could have swung it,but it would have been tough,&quot; Mr. Wheeler says. &quot;I'm reallythankful for {Canada's} system.&quot;   Many Americans are deeply dissatisfied with the U.S.health-care system, worried about high costs and unhappy thatmore than 32 million Americans don't have any healthinsurance. Some of the insured worry about losing theircoverage. The uninsured, including many working families, paytheir own medical bills if they can, rely on charity, or dowithout.   In one study, 7.5% of Americans surveyed said that forfinancial reasons they didn't get needed medical attention.In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 69% of U.S.voters said they would support adoption of a Canadian-styleuniversal health-care system; 20% were opposed.   Canadians are almost universally devoted to universalhealth insurance. &quot;It is immensely popular,&quot; says pollsterMichael Sullivan of Decima Research Inc. in Toronto.&quot;Canadians' secret nightmare is that their health-care systemwill change and come to resemble the U.S. system.&quot;   Tucked into a hillside above downtown Montreal, the575-bed Royal Vic was built nearly a century ago by tworailroad magnates. A bedpans-to-brainscan tour of the RoyalVic helps explain why a Canadian-style system is touted bysome analysts for the U.S.   Canada's health-care system is the second most expensivein the world, but it is still cheaper than the U.S. system.Last year, the U.S. spent $2,566 per capita on health care.Canada spent $1,991 in U.S. dollars.   Money is tight at the Royal Vic. Patients, doctors andnurses aren't shy about pointing out problems: The hospitalis 97 years old and showing its age. It runs at fullcapacity, putting a strain on staff. There are waiting listsfor elective surgery; some equipment is out of date.   But Sandra Li, a nurse in the surgical intensive-careunit, figures the quality of care at the Royal Vic is &quot;aboutequal&quot; to that at hospitals in Los Angeles and San Franciscowhere she has worked. A study published last year in theJournal of the American Medical Association comparedpost-operation death rates for 11 surgical procedures in theU.S. and in Canada, one measure of health-care results; itdidn't find significant differences.   &quot;Sure there's a few problems. But big deal,&quot; says LarryTalbot, tubes trailing from his arm to the blinking andwhirring kidney dialysis machine beside him. Before universalhealth insurance was introduced 20 years ago, &quot;I can rememberI had to pay cash up front when I went to see a diabetesspecialist,&quot; Mr. Talbot says. &quot;You're talking to a guy whoreally needs this,&quot; he adds. &quot;It's a fantastic system. Don'tever take it away.&quot;   Each Canadian province manages its own health-insuranceplan. Quebec's program is typical. The province covers 100%of medically necessary physician and hospital services.Cosmetic surgery and in vitro fertilization aren't covered,for example. Quebec also covers certain additional items suchas prescription drugs for the elderly and the poor and dentalcare for children. The province hasn't extended drug anddental coverage to all because doing so would be too costly.   Patients must pay for extras such as a private orsemi-private hospital room. A bed in a standard four-personroom is free. Unlike some health maintenance organizationsand preferred-provider insurance plans in the U.S., Canadianscan choose any doctor and any hospital they want.   Quebec, like other provinces, does a lot of publicworrying about the future of its universal health-care planand how to pay for it. Quebec's population is aging, and thecost of free drugs for the elderly and poor is rising 15% ayear. On the revenue side, Quebec complains that the federalgovernment pays a smaller share of health costs now than itdid 10 years ago. The provincial government, hospitals,doctors and nurses bicker over how Quebec's system should berun. However, policy makers at the federal and provinciallevel say privately that much of the noisy public debate isjust normal politicking, and they predict a long life foruniversal health insurance in Quebec and the rest of Canada.   &quot;I don't think the system is perfect. But the systemworks,&quot; says Charles W. McDougall, the Royal Vic's chiefoperating officer. From his attic office above the hospitalkitchen, he manages an annual operating budget of $128million and oversees a staff of 2,000. The bulk of the budgetcomes from the Quebec health ministry, which gets about 40%of its financing from the federal treasury. Revenue from suchthings as private-room charges, parking fees and thecafeteria provide the remainder. Capital spending budgets arehandled separately.   The Royal Vic's 325 attending physicians are paid directlyby the provincial government. They aren't civil servants.Like most Quebec doctors, they are in private practice andget a fixed fee for each medical service performed (a simpleexamination at a general practitioner's office is worth$12.15, an annual physical $24.20). The Royal Vic is ateaching hospital affiliated with McGill University, so somedoctors also collect a teaching salary.   As the only customer, the Quebec government has a lot morecontrol over costs than do private insurers, governments andindividuals in the U.S. The Royal Vic must stay within itsannual budget; the province won't cover any deficits.Physicians can't raise their fees unilaterally, and Quebeccontrols the total amount it pays out. For example, once ageneral practitioner hits $39,474 in quarterly fees, thegovernment pays only 25% of each bill submitted over thatamount until the next quarter starts. The GP's associationsays about 20% of its members exceed the limit one or moretimes a year.   The cost differences between the U.S. and Canada can bestartling. At the Royal Vic a standard quadruple coronaryartery bypass costs an average $12,236, including physicianfees. At New England Medical Center, a teaching hospital ofsimilar size in Boston, the same operation costs an average$25,439.   In a recent report, the U.S. General Accounting Office, aninvestigative arm of Congress, singled out three main reasonsCanada's system is cheaper: Administrative overhead,physician fees and hospital costs are all sharply lower here.   The Royal Vic's overhead is lower than a U.S. hospital's&quot;all the way down the line,&quot; Mr. McDougall says. Forstarters, the hospital runs at full capacity, so that fixedcosts, such as Mr. McDougall's salary, are spread over thegreatest number of patients possible. U.S. hospitals average65% full, the GAO says.   The Royal Vic doesn't need a big accounting department todeal with myriad insurance companies. Patients don't have tofill out dozens of forms; they just flash their Quebechealth-insurance card.   Canadian physicians are paid less (and work harder, onestudy claims) than their U.S. counterparts. In 1987, theaverage gross income for a Canadian doctor was $127,777,compared with $256,000 for a U.S. doctor. Yet Canada has oneactive physician per 451 people, almost the same as the U.S.   Doctors at the Royal Vic gripe about their pay, but mostdon't seem all that jealous of their U.S. counterparts. &quot;MySubaru gets me around very nicely -- so it's not a BMW,&quot; saysNicolas V. Christou. A surgeon, he likes being able topractice medicine without having to ask an insurance companyto approve every procedure or worrying whether a patient canafford treatment.   &quot;American doctors have been greedy pigs,&quot; charges Sarah S.Prichard, a nephrologist, or kidney specialist. Dr. Prichardsays she and her husband, a cardiologist, earn maybe 20% ofwhat they could in the U.S., where &quot;we would earn $500,000each.&quot; They aren't planning to move south. &quot;I'm a truebeliever in our health-care system,&quot; she says. &quot;If you aresick, you get excellent care. You are never asked who youare.&quot;   While lower administrative overhead and physicians' feesdon't affect patients directly, tight cost controls do. Ifyour case isn't urgent, you have to wait in line for certainexpensive procedures at the Royal Vic, the tradeoff forfull-capacity operation. The wait for a cataract/lensreplacement operation is about three months, for a coronarybypass three to six. But Jonathan L. Meakins, surgeon inchief, says that &quot;if somebody needs something done tonight,we'll do it.&quot;   Tight budgets put extra strain on patients and staff. Thehospital saves $660,000 a year by using an older type ofinjectable dye for X-rays that is less comfortable forpatients than a newer dye. It bought new beds with manualcranks instead of electric motors. That means the Royal Vic's1,000 nurses work a little harder every time they have toraise or lower a bed and patients can't just push a button todo it for themselves. On the maternity floor, it is strictlyBYOD-bring your own diapers. The hospital stopped handing outfree ones eight years ago.   Canadian hospitals don't have as much high-tech equipmentas U.S. hospitals. &quot;We clearly lag behind in technology,&quot;says Mr. McDougall, adding that &quot;we need a little more, not alot more&quot; equipment. But Royal Vic doctors think many U.S.hospitals have too many pricey machines that U.S. doctors --driven in part by fear of lawsuits -- overuse. &quot;Our peoplepractice smarter,&quot; contends W. Dale Dauphinee, physician inchief at the Royal Vic and chairman of McGill's department ofmedicine. In the U.S., a physician might order a CT scan tohelp determine whether a liver is enlarged. Dr. Dauphineesays he would probably check the size of the liver usingold-fashioned equipment -- his fingers. &quot;The wasting of moneyin the U.S. system is mind-boggling,&quot; he says.   The Royal Vic isn't destitute. After years of delay, thehospital is spending $35 million on a new building to houseits laboratories, intensive-care units and emergency room.   It's about time, say doctors and nurses in the existingemergency room, a cramped, dilapidated space that could use acoat of paint. A weekend here shows what happens when all theproblems of Canadian health care converge. The ophthalmoscopeand otoscope next to each bed that doctors use to examinepatients' eyes and ears don't always work. Sometimes, ittakes hours to get a specialist to come down from a ward fora consultation, complains Francois Guimond, an emergency-roomdoctor with blood on his Nikes. &quot;The reason I hate my job isthat I can't get people admitted to beds,&quot; says a colleague,Robert Foxford. If beds aren't available in the hospital,patients in the emergency room stay there.   &quot;Look who's back,&quot; says an ambulance attendant as hewheels in an old man. &quot;Oh no,&quot; sighs a nurse. The man is oneof three downtown drunks who turn up regularly at theemergency room, or ER, especially in the winter. Members ofthe hospital staff claim the men sometimes call 911 from apay phone, saying someone is lying in the street. Then theyassume the position and wait for the ambulance. &quot;It's like ahotel, they ask what time breakfast is served,&quot; says SuzanneDoyon, a physician here.   Edward Newton left the Royal Vic ER three years ago for ajob at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, partly becausehe was fed up with the Quebec health-care system, partly forthe chance to work on more trauma cases. (Montreal is prettypeaceful compared to a big U.S. city.) The U.S. has &quot;a lessfrustrating system,&quot; Dr. Newton says. There is more money tobuy equipment, he says. At the Royal Vic, he shared an officewith 10 people. In LA, he has a private office.   But while Los Angeles has four big county hospitals, anadjacent county doesn't have any, Dr. Newton says. &quot;Accessisn't uniform {in the U.S.}. That's the great thing about theCanadian system.&quot;   Sylvia R. Cruess, medical director at the Royal Vic, grewup in the U.S. She came to Montreal in 1955 to intern, wentback to the U.S. for more training and then came back toMontreal to stay.   Dr. Cruess says she isn't certain the U.S. could simplycopy the Canadian health-care system because, she contends,Canadians and Americans are different. &quot;I'm not sureAmericans would accept the fact they couldn't buy somethingbetter than the next person.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
