He also states that regulation has failed to achieve theseobjectives and to provide an appropriate level of stability in the industrybecause it has been unable to maintain a reasonable balance between theforces of supply and demand. The principal reasons given for this failureare the inflexibility of the regulatory process combined with the existenceof substitute products which compete against gas in end-use markets.This paper discusses the changes which have been implemented at the federallevel. It also examines the implications of these changes on the naturalgas industry, and discusses alternatives available to state regulatorsfor modifying the regulatory approach to local distribution companiesgiven current conditions in the industry.</TEXT></DOC>
