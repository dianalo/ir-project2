ZweigStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/19/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CMB CCI BACFINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chase Manhattan Bank lowered the interest rate it charges on its regular credit cards to 17.5% from 19.8%, amid predictions that the move will soon pressure other major banks to slash their rates.    Although consumer groups welcomed the rate cut, banking analysts doubted that the Chase Manhattan Corp. unit would gain enough new accounts to offset reduced interest revenue.    The new rate, which takes effect Feb. 1 on old and new balances, is the lowest offered by top credit card issuers. Chase, the nation's third-largest credit card issuer, with more than 4.5 million accounts, also reduced the rate it charges on its so-called premium Visa card to 16.5% from 19.8%.    Credit card interest rates have been lowered recently by some other banks, but with the exception of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., New York, these haven't been large card issuers. And some of those that have cut rates are understood to have tightened credit standards. The current rate among other major issuers is in the 19% range.    Despite steep declines in short-term interest rates, banks and thrifts generally haven't passed on the reduced cost of funds by lowering interest rates on credit card loans. Responding to criticism from some legislators and consumer groups that have called for legislation to cap credit card rates, bankers have cited high costs of processing, fraud, and uncertainty about interest rates as reasons for not lowering credit card rates more rapidly.    Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a Washington-based consumer group, said, &quot;It's a signal that we're going to see more competition in rates and fees, but we're disappointed that they didn't offer an even lower rate in the 10%-to-15% range.&quot;    Meanwhile, Chase predicted the step would generate as many as 1.5 million new accounts, according to Arthur F. Ryan, a Chase vice chairman for consumer banking. &quot;We also want people to reach into their pocket and use our card instead of somebody else's,&quot; Mr. Ryan said. Provisions in the new tax law that limit deductions of consumer interest charges were a &quot;consideration,&quot; though not a major one, in Chase's decision to reduce rates, according to Mr. Ryan.    The rate cut was seen by banking analysts as a dramatic attempt to gain market share at the expense of big banking companies like New York-based Citicorp, the nation's biggest issuer, with more than nine million accounts, and San Francisco-based Bank of America, No. 2, with more than seven million accounts.    &quot;It's a bold move,&quot; said H. Spencer Nilson, publisher the Nilson Report, an industry publication. &quot;It sounds like an all-out attack on Citicorp. This might force some of the other major money center banks to go along, particularly in the East.&quot; But he doubted that many consumers would switch cards to Chase, adding that &quot;I think it's going to result in a substantial cut in their own earnings.&quot;    Stephen Berman, bank analyst at Nomura Securities International Inc., called the step &quot;a significant negative for purveyors of credit cards,&quot; noting that profits from credit cards have propped up otherwise lackluster earnings from other business activities at many big banks. As a result of the rate reduction, he said he's lowering his full-year 1987 earnings estimates for Chase Manhattan Corp. to $5.40 a share from $5.90. He also lowered his estimate for Citicorp to $6.50 from $7.20, based on an assumption that Citicorp will also cut rates on its regular credit cards.    Citicorp and Bank of America's parent, BankAmerica Corp., which still charge 19.8% on their regular cards, declined to say whether they will also lower these charges. Several weeks ago, Citicorp announced it planned to reduce interest rates on its preferred Visa and Mastercards to 16.8% from 19.8%, effective Jan. 1. But it also boosted the annual fee on these cards to $50 from $40.    In October 1985, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., in an apparently successful bid to gain new accounts, cut the rate on its cards to 17.8% from 19.8%. But Charles R. Walsh, executive vice president for retail banking, said, &quot;We have no immediate plans to adjust our rates again, but we'll continue to evaluate them.&quot; The change worked for Manufacturers Hanover, which had a relatively small number of credit card accounts, because the bank moved early.    Chase said it will maintain the $20 annual fee on its regular Visa and Mastercards and the $45 fee on its premium card but will waive them for customers who charge more than $2,400 in one year on their regular cards and more than $5,000 on their premium card. The bank also said it is offering immediately a package of new services, including rebates on car rentals, air fares, and hotel charges. Although the new rates apply to cash advances as well as purchases, Chase said it will raise its charge on advances in March from a flat fee of 50 cents to 2%. </TEXT></DOC>
