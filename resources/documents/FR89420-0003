Ourproposal invited the submission of written comments, which were requiredto be postmarked or received on or before February 8, 1989. We did notreceive any comments. Based on the rationale set forth in the proposal,we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>The telephone number of Seattle's existing animal export inspection facility,operated by Sandamp;W Export Ltd., is incorrectly listed in andSection; 91.14.We are correcting the number to read (206) 241-1837. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The addition of another animal export inspection facility at the port ofSeattle, Washington, will facilitate the exportation of livestock fromthe United States. We believe the addition of this facility will have littleor no economic impact on animal exporters, the majority of whom are smallbusinesses. The primary impact will be the increased convenience of havingtwo animal export facilities from which to choose. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
