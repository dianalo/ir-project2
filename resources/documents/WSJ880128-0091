Late yesterday, the IPE said it will &quot;urgently&quot; move to boost its moribund crude-futures trading to compete with the Nymex's closely followed West Texas Intermediate futures and options. IPE Chairman Derek Whiting accused the Nymex of having &quot;turned its back on seeking to serve a truly global marketplace&quot; by pulling out of the proposed linkup.    Mr. Whiting said &quot;significant trade interests have expressed a desire to trade crude-oil futures in London and have voiced their disappointment to us at the Nymex decision.&quot; Some analysts suggested the IPE might launch its own West Texas Intermediate contract.    The IPE statements were in response to the Nymex's announcement last Thursday that it wouldn't follow through on plans to allow the IPE to trade on its own floor the Nymex's West Texas Intermediate contract. The Nymex's contract is a world-wide benchmark for oil prices. The decision stunned the IPE, though many industry analysts said the decision wasn't that surprising because IPE clearly had more to gain from a linkup than the Nymex.    A Nymex spokeswoman said the exchange had no immediate comment on the IPE statements. One Nymex official said unofficially, however, that the IPE &quot;is just mad because we left them at the altar.&quot;    Officials of New York's Commodity Exchange expressed similar disappointment this month when the Nymex pulled out of a separate proposal to move to a new $600 million trading facility that was to hold five New York futures exchanges.    In the IPE announcement, Mr. Whiting said his exchange might scrap or redesign its lightly traded, North Sea Brent crude futures contract to &quot;develop urgently a more suitable&quot; crude product to compete with the Nymex. He wasn't specific except to say that the new contract &quot;will include some form of significant trading incentive scheme to encourage initial participation.&quot; He suggested the Nymex, in scuttling the trans-Atlantic linkup, was ignoring the needs of European, Middle Eastern and Far Eastern traders.    Nymex floor members don't seem too fearful of the IPE's call to arms. &quot;There are several battleships at the (Nymex),&quot; said Eric T. Bolling, a vice president at Geldermann Inc., &quot;that could handle some of those European gunboats.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
