Conventionalshipboard air ducts are constructed of metal walls insulated externallywith fibrous-glass board. Composite materials are being considered asreplacements for these duct walls. Thermal measurements were conductedusing the National Bureau of Standards 1-meter Guarded Hot Plate at amean temperature of 23.9{sup 0}C (75{sup 0}F). Measurements of the fibrous-glassboard specimens were within 3% of certified values of NBS SRM 1450a,fibrous-glass board. Measurements of two aramid-fiber honeycomb specimenswere approximately one-half the thermal resistance of the fibrous-glassboard specimens.</TEXT></DOC>
