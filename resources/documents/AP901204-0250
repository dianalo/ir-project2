(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Upjohn Co. and Biopure Corp. onTuesday signed an agreement to develop and market a human bloodsubstitute derived from cow hemoglobin.   Under the agreement, Upjohn will pay $25 million for worldmarketing rights for all Biopure's blood-related products. Thepharmaceutical firm also must foot the bill for pre-clinical andclinical development of Hemopure, the blood substitute for use onhumans.   Hemopure is awaiting Federal Drug Administration approval forclinical testing, which has been completed for Oxyglobin, a bloodsubstitute for animals.   ``Biopure has worked diligently over the past seven years todevelop a mammalian-based substitute for human and animal blood,''said Carl Rausch, co-founder and chief executive officer ofBoston-based Biopure.   ``The potential product for human use, when approved, will beginto lessen the estimated 100 million-unit annual shortfall in humanblood,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
