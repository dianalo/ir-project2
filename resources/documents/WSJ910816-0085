Chief ExecutiveOfficer Frederick Joseph agreed to pay $3 million to $3.5million to settle thrift regulators' claims against him in asuit alleging that Drexel employees rigged the junk-bondmarket in a scheme to defraud savings and loan associations.   In an amended suit filed in federal court in Manhattan,the regulators dropped Mr. Joseph as a defendant, but added21 others, including former Drexel managing director SylvanSchefler. An attorney for Mr. Schefler, a good friend offormer Drexel junk-bond chief Michael Milken, said he hadn'tseen the suit and declined to comment.</LP><TEXT>   The suit, first filed in January by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp., alleged thatMr. Milken was the ringleader in a scheme using bribery andextortion to entice thrifts to invest in junk bonds from 1982to August 1989. The suit initially sought $6 billion indamages but seeks no specific amount in the amended versionfiled yesterday.   Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to six trading-related felonieslast year and has begun serving a 10-year prison sentence. Hehas denied the thrift regulators' allegations.   In the suit, Mr. Joseph was named as a defendant becausehe was a so-called &quot;controlling person,&quot; or top executive, atDrexel. Mr. Joseph, who has remained at the firm through itsbankruptcy proceedings, has been cooperating with thriftregulators and will continue to aid them in the case. Most ofhis settlement will be covered by Drexel insurance policiesfor its executives. The exact value of the settlement isn'tknown because part of it will be paid out over time.   Mr. Joseph and his attorney couldn't be reached forcomment.   The FDIC's General Counsel Alfred J.T. Byrne said, &quot;Weexpect that cooperation by Joseph will significantly enhancethe ability of the FDIC and the RTC to prove our allegationsthat Milken and individuals under his direction monopolizedand manipulated the junk-bond market, resulting in billionsof dollars of loses to federally insured institutions.&quot;   David Boies, an attorney for the regulators, said theamended suit adds details about the alleged bribery of thriftofficials and the alleged destruction of documents at Drexel.&quot;The basic thrust {of the suit} doesn't change,&quot; he said.   The suit also adds as defendants several salespeople fromthe Drexel junk-bond department, including Frederick Bordenand Kevin Boylan. Mr. Borden was responsible for marketingjunk bonds to several savings and loans on the West Coast and&quot;was aware of the false and misleading nature of therepresentations used to market such securities to suchcustomers,&quot; the suit alleged. Mr. Boylan was head salesman ofconvertible bonds in the junk-bond department, the suit said.   Neither Mr. Borden nor Mr. Boylan could be reached forcomment.   Mr. Schefler was named as a defendant as both a&quot;controlling person&quot; and as a co-conspirator. The suit saidMr. Schefler left Drexel's retail operations in 1983 toassume responsibility for its junk-bond operations on theEast Coast. Mr. Milken operated out of Drexel's Los Angelesoffice.   The suit alleged that Mr. Schefler oversaw Drexel'sinterest in Tri-Capital Ltd., which invested in leveragedbuy-outs and junk bonds. The suit said the defendants usedTri-Capital as a &quot;captive buyer&quot; for junk bonds. Mr. Scheflerand the other defendants allegedly marketed investments inTri-Capital to savings and loans but didn't disclose thatthey controlled the venture's investment decisions, accordingto the suit.   Mr. Boies, a partner at Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, the NewYork firm hired by the FDIC and RTC to pursue Drexel-relatedclaims, said that although some defendants were added to theamended lawsuit, &quot;the key defendants are the same as before.&quot;   Also named as defendants in both the amended and originalsuits are Charles H. Keating Jr., who formerly controlled thefailed Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.;David Paul, ex-chairman of the failed CenTrust Savings Bankof Miami; and Thomas P. Spiegel, former chief executiveofficer of Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association, BeverlyHills, Calif.   The suit alleged that Mr. Milken and his employees &quot;gavebribes and favors&quot; to savings and loan executives in order togain control over their investment decisions. For instance,the suit alleged that the Milken group helped Mr. Paul evaderegulatory restrictions on insider purchases of Centruststock.   The suit alleged that Mr. Spiegel caused Columbia to buyunsuitable junk-bond securities in exchange for his beingallowed to invest in a lucrative Drexel employees'partnership.   Attorneys for Messrs. Keating, Paul and Spiegel couldn'tbe reached for comment.   Richard Hollander, another former junk-bond salesman underMr. Milken, was also named as a defendant for his allegedrole in making investment arrangements with Columbia andCentrust.   Other former Drexel employees added as defendants includeHarold Horowitz, who the suit said served as a lobbyist forMr. Milken in Washington, D.C., and &quot;a fund-raiser forpotentially friendly politicians.&quot;   Messrs. Hollander and Horowitz couldn't be reached forcomment.   The new suit also adds some defendants for their allegedrole in Mr. Milken's dealings with former arbitrager andconvicted insider-trader Ivan Boesky. For instance, theamended suit names junk-bond salesman Reed Harman, whosecustomers included Mr. Boesky.   The suit also alleged that Peter Gardiner, a trader in thejunk-bond department, &quot;destroyed incriminating documentsimmediately after Ivan Boesky's insider-trading indictmentwas announced.&quot;   Messrs. Harman and Gardiner couldn't be reached forcomment.   Mr. Milken's supporters maintain that the Drexel junk-bonddepartment did nothing illegal or unusual in its dealingswith savings and loans. In a statement, a spokesman for Mr.Milken said the amended suit &quot;has no more merit than itspredecessor. This ongoing attempt to rewrite history in orderto find a scapegoat for the savings and loan crisis iswithout factual foundation and ignores the truth.&quot;   The spokesman added that the &quot;record proves that thehigh-yield market was open and highly competitive and thatsavings and loans made their own decisions and were counseledby independent advisers.&quot;   ---   Kenneth H.
