These materialsincluded Crown 700, Premium Ni-hard, Cromin 15, a standard weld overlayand Combustalloy weld overlay. It was found that grinding element livescould be appreciably increased using weld overlay materials. Combustalloyweld overlay rolls and either Crown 700 or Cromin 15 grinding rings wererecommended as the optimum combination. The use of a vane wheel assemblyincreased the life of the grinding elements and the use of mechanicalface seals eliminated the problem of gear case contamination.</TEXT></DOC>
