At times, therewas no excess emission or absorption, and at others, much. During activetimes, the excess emission varied greatly with phase and seemed to comefrom an extended region. Two UV observations, taken contemporaneouslywith optical spectra, also showed strong variations in the emission-linestrengths. The data are consistent with intermittent mass transfer andimply that RT Lac is similar to other objects which have transient disks.22 references.</TEXT></DOC>
