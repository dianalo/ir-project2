By a 5-4 vote, the high court said the regulations areconsistent with federal law and don't violate either the freespeech rights of doctors and their patients or women's rightto abortion.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling, written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,was a critical victory for the Bush administration, whichdefended the regulations, and for the anti-abortion movement.The decision &quot;is a defeat for those organizations that demandtax dollars to promote abortion as a family-planning option,&quot;said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the NationalRight To Life Committee.   But abortion-rights groups said that the decision willmake it substantially more difficult to obtain abortions forpoor women or young women who may lack information aboutabortion and have no access to other medical counseling.   Civil liberties lawyers also said the decision givesofficials broad power to restrict information ingovernment-funded programs. &quot;It virtually gives thegovernment a blank check to manipulate information in anygovernment program,&quot; said Rachael Pine, a lawyer with theAmerican Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom Project.&quot;That's a frightening principle for the free speech rights ofthose who work in and rely upon government-funded programs.&quot;   The decision also marked the first vote on abortion by thecourt's newest member, Justice David Souter. Although heposed questions when the case was argued last October thatsuggested concern that the regulations might be too broad, hejoined Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion and expressed noseparate views.   The ruling also marked the first time Justice SandraO'Connor, the court's only woman, voted to strike down anentire set of abortion regulations. She was a dissenter,along with Justices Harry Blackmun, Thurgood Marshall andJohn Stevens.   Issued in 1988 by the Reagan administration, theregulations bar federally aided clinics from counseling womenthat abortion is an option or from providing the name of thenearest abortion clinic to women who ask for it. Theregulations say women who are pregnant must be referred toprenatal care facilities. Clinics that advise about abortionsor perform them may be run by the same organizations thatoperate federally aided family-planning clinics, but theoperations must be kept separate physically, including thebookkeeping.   The regulations represented a change in federal policyimplementing what is known as Title X of the federal PublicHealth Service Act, passed by Congress in 1970. Title Xauthorized federal grants to family-planning clinics, andrecent estimates show that funds were going to about 3,900clinics serving nearly five million women.   The high court previously said Congress may ban federallyfunded abortions. The 1970 law prohibited funding programs&quot;where abortion is a method of family planning.&quot; Inchallenging the regulations, abortion-rights groups arguedthat this limited only the performance of abortions, not theoffering of medical advice. To ban counseling, they argued,was inconsistent with the law's purpose of providing poorwomen with subsidized reproductive health care.   But the high court concluded yesterday that the 1970 lawwas ambiguous and that the federal regulations adopted in1988 by the Reagan administration were a reasonableinterpretation of the law.   The justices also rejected the argument, advanced indissenting opinions by Justices Blackmun and O'Connor, thatthe regulations were being interpreted by the court in a waythat raises serious questions about the law'sconstitutionality. The dissenters argued that interpretingthe law to permit the 1988 regulations raises serious FirstAmendment questions that render that interpretationunacceptable, and therefore the regulations are invalid.   The majority said the regulations don't violate the FirstAmendment by restricting free speech of doctors aboutabortion. Chief Justice Rehnquist said the government isn'trequired to fund speech about particular ideas.   But the court disagreed on one point with the government,concluding that the regulations don't prohibit a doctor fromgiving an abortion referral to a woman whose pregnancy islife-threatening. At the oral argument, the JusticeDepartment suggested that abortion advice would be barredeven in life-threatening circumstances.   The majority rejected the argument that by impedinginformation for women, the regulations interfere with theright to abortion.   &quot;It would undoubtedly be easier for a woman seeking anabortion if she could receive information about abortion froma Title X project,&quot; Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, &quot;but theConstitution does not require that the government distort . .. its program in order to provide that information.&quot;   Justice Blackmun countered, &quot;By suppressing medicallypertinent information and injecting a restrictive ideologicalmessage unrelated to considerations of maternal health, thegovernment places formidable obstacles in the path of Title Xclients' freedom of choice and thereby violates their . . .rights.&quot;   The decision affirmed the ruling of a federal appealscourt in New York that had upheld the regulations. Federalappeals courts in Boston and Denver had invalidated theregulations. (Rust vs. Sullivan).</TEXT></DOC>
