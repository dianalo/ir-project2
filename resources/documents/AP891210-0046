It remains a rocky and uncertain road, with British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher maintaining a lone stance against plansfor economic and monetary integration and community-wide welfareand workers' rights.   But the leaders of the wealthy club encompassing 320 millionpeople emerged from the two-day summit declaring themselves unitedin a new role as a single West European bloc committed to reachingout toward the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.   ``Henceforth there is no longer a Europe in two parts acting inthe shadows or at the initiative of the two superpowers,'' declaredsummit host, French President Francois Mitterrand, winding up themeeting on Saturday.   ``Clearly, as of today we can say Yalta belongs more and more tohistory,'' he added of the 1945 conference at the end of World WarII that divided the continent of Europe between East and West.   The rhetoric, at least, echoed a call by President Bush lastweek to the European Community to intensify efforts to integrateand become ``a magnet that draws the forces of reform forward inEastern Europe.''   But from Mitterrand, the most flamboyantly outspoken advocate ofEuropean unity, to Mrs. Thatcher, the often-prickly pragmatist, theleaders displayed a new political will to act together to encouragechange and guard against anarchy.   ``Despite disagreements, what emerges most strongly from thissummit is the degree to which the community ... can act as thedriving force for the development of the whole of Europe at aturning point in the Continent's history,'' Mrs. Thatcher said at anews conference.   She reiterated her lone dissent from the decisions to pressahead with the monetary union and to adopt a ``social charter.''   But she sounded conciliatory compared with her combativeattitude during past bitter internal disputes over issues rangingfrom farm subsidies to whether the community is supposed to be atrading bloc or an embryonic political federation.   Mrs. Thatcher's low-key tone also may have been spurred by pollsin Britain showing most voters now disapprove of her tough line inthe community. A Gallup poll published Saturday in London's DailyTelegraph showed 49 percent of voters questioned disapproved,compared with 38 percent approval. The rest had no opinion.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who combined with Mitterrandto override Mrs. Thatcher's objections to the monetary unionconference, went home well-pleased with having secured backing fromthe summit for eventual German reunification.   It is a sensitive issue in a continent that was overrun byHitler's Germany in World War II and in peace is dominated by thepowerful economy of West Germany alone.   Britain apparently raised no objections to a statement ofsupport for reunification.   But France, the Netherlands and Italy all expressed reservations.   The final statement was agreed to only after Kohl spelled outthat by a reunified Germany he meant only the two existing Germannations, East Germany and West Germany, and not German-speakingareas in neighboring countries.   ``We seek the strengthening of the state of peace in Europe inwhich the German people will regain its unity through freeself-determination,'' the statement said.   On monetary integration, the community leaders agreed to convenean intergovernmental conference in December 1990 to startnegotiations on establishing a single currency and one system ofcentral banks for the 12 countries.   Mrs. Thatcher said Britain would go along to the negotiations,which are expected to take several years. But she indicated thatBritain may veto any final attempt to have one currency and thecentral bank system.   She shrugged off being brushed aside on the issue of the``social charter,'' which is non-binding. ``It is a pity ... butthe outcome is no great tragedy,'' she said.   The community leaders left Strasbourg committed to intensifieddialogue with the Soviet Union and other reform-minded EastEuropean nations. They also pledged to set up a EuropeanDevelopment Bank to assist new European democracies and held outthe possibility of special trade and other links with them.   Said Kohl, ``We have made a substantial step forward ... We havesaid there is no alternative to the promise of Europeanunification.''</TEXT></DOC>
