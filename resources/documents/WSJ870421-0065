The Washington-based provider of long-distance telecommunications services reported first-quarter earnings of $25 million, or nine cents a share, including an after-tax gain of $5 million for tax-loss carry-forwards and a pre-tax gain of $12.3 million on its previously reported settlement of antitrust litigation.    Excluding both gains, MCI earned $11 million, or about four cents a share, according to William E. Conway Jr., the company's chief financial officer. That compares with net of $20 million, or eight cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.    The latest earnings were in line with the estimates of most analysts, who expect a lackluster performance from MCI this year. Some analysts believe the company's profit will pick up in the second half. But others say earnings will be hurt in the third and fourth quarters as well, depending on how much it reduces its prices in response to price cuts the Federal Communications Commission is expected to order American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. to make this summer.    As a result, Charles Schelke, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said he expects 1987 to be &quot;the nadir for MCI from an operating earnings standpoint.&quot;    MCI said only that it expects to be profitable this year. For 1986 the company posted a net loss of $448.4 million, largely because of restructuring charges. As a result, the company still has $222 million of net operating-loss carry-forwards available to reduce its future tax bills.    Mr. Conway said he expects MCI to cut its prices by about 3% to 5% later this year to match a similar price reduction by ATandamp;T. A price cut of that size, he added, would be mostly offset by lower costs that MCI would pay for connecting its long-distance network to the networks operated by local phone companies. But analysts say the ATandamp;T cut could be larger, if the FCC takes into consideration taxes and other factors, and could hurt MCI more than the company expects.    Mr. Conway said the second quarter would be MCI's &quot;toughest&quot; this year because the company will have to absorb the full impact of a 9% price cut that it initiated March 1. The company's success, he said, depends on its ability to increase revenue. Mr. Conway declined to comment on whether MCI, as some analysts predict, might report a second-quarter loss.    In the first quarter, MCI said revenue rose almost 17% to $955 million from $819 million a year earlier. Compared with last year's weak fourth-quarter revenue, the increase was almost 4%.    MCI indicated that it is making some progress in its effort to woo corporate customers, who generate larger profits for long-distance companies than residential users. During the first quarter, Mr. Conway said MCI received major orders from Hercules Inc., Westinghouse Electric Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. that will add between $5 million and $10 million to MCI's annual revenue.    Mr. Conway said initial orders for the company's toll-free in-bound calling service, known as 800 service, have been &quot;very encouraging.&quot;    In addition, the executive said the company installed improved fraud-detection systems in an effort to reduce the amount of revenue it is unable to collect. The uncollectible revenue results mostly from callers who make fraudulent use of other customers' access codes.    In last year's fourth quarter, the company said a &quot;significant&quot; amount of uncollectible revenue contributed to its weak results. Mr. Conway wouldn't say how much revenue the company was unable to collect. But he said, &quot;It's still too high, and we're working to reduce it.&quot;    Mr. Conway maintained that MCI is also doing an &quot;outstanding job&quot; of controlling costs. Last year's restructuring, which included the elimination of about 2,300 jobs, reduced the company's sales and general and administrative expenses to $265 million in the first quarter from $274 million in the fourth quarter, he said. Mr. Conway said the company also has reduced the cost of the lines it leases from other carriers to a low of 5% of revenue, Mr. Conway said.    MCI said its largest cost -- the access charges it must pay to connect its network with those of the local phone companies -- consumed about 50% of its first-quarter revenue. After rising sharply as a percentage of revenue for three years, these costs should stabilize this year at about 51% or 52% of revenue, Mr. Conway said.    Most analysts agree that MCI is doing a good job of controlling costs, but some wonder how much more can be done. &quot;There's only so much more fat they can cut before cutting into the bone,&quot; said Jack Grubman of PaineWebber Inc. &quot;The real issue is sustainability of meaningful revenue growth in the face of ATandamp;T price cuts and Sprint.&quot;    US Sprint Communications Co. is the nation's third-largest long-distance company, after ATandamp;T and second-place MCI. Since it was formed last year as a joint venture between GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., Sprint has been especially aggressive in seeking new customers.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI closed at $6.625 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
