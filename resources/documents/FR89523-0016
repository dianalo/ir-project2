The proposed rule invited comments for 45 days with the comment periodending on December 29, 1988. Approximately 190 copies of the proposed rulewere mailed to various State and Federal government agencies, organizations,associations, and individuals considered possibly to have knowledge ofmitten crabs or a vested interest in the outcome of the review process.The mailing included, but was not limited to: <ITAG tagnum="14">_All State fish and game agencies;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Conservation agencies of all Canadian Provinces and the CanadianWildlife Service;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Conservation agencies of Asian and European countries where mittencrabs are known to exist in the environment; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Domestic and foreign conservation and professional organizationsand associations; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Academic community; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Federal agencies;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Aquaculture specialists; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Business organizations including the wholesale food industry. </ITAG>A complete copy of the mailing list can be obtained by contacting the individualidentified in the section above entitled <T2>``for further information contact.''</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Summary and Analysis of Comments and Action Taken </ITAG>Two submissions, both written, were received by the Service in responseto the proposed rule. The first response, received before the end of thecomment period and submitted by a State government, expressed strong supportfor our proposed rule in the belief that importation of mitten crabs wouldthreaten agriculture, human health and safety, and native crustaceans.That State expressed the additional belief that threats from mitten crabswere real because of the ease at which they adapt to new environments.Subsequent to December 29, 1988, the second written communication was receivedby the Service, it being from an individual in Paris, France, promisingto send a copy of his principal research work on the subject. This particularletter expressed no opinions, and contained no information for or againstthe proposed rule. The research publication, which was received severalweeks later, is an extensive study of the Chinese mitten crab (<T3>Eriocheir sinensis</T3>) published on July 26, 1948. The paper, whichfocuses on the biology of the crab in France, contains no new informationto support or refute arguments made in the Service's proposed rule. Inconsideration of the responses discussed above, and in light of the bestavailable information on mitten crabs, the Service has determined thatthis final rule is warranted. The basis for his decision is included inthe discussion that follows. Service involvement with mitten crabs began in 1986 when, in a September16 letter, the California Department of Fish and Game (Department) requestedthat the Service prevent the importation of mitten crabs (genus <T3>Eriocheir</T3>) into the United States. The Department, aware thatlive Chinese mitten crabs (<T3>Eriocheir sinensis</T3>) were being legally imported from China andsold as a live food item at Asian-American food markets in the Los Angelesand San Francisco Bay Areas for $10-$15 per pound, was concerned that peoplemight release live crabs into public or private waters as, for example,part of religious ceremonies or for other unspecified reasons. Such releases,the Department stated, were increasing in occurrence in the State's waters.Believing a threat to the State existed, the Department itself on June12, 1986, initiated actions to prevent the importation, transportation,and possession in California of the genus <T3>Eriocheir </T3>by proposing to place it on that State's ``List of ProhibitedSpecies.'' That effort resulted in the addition of the genus to that listin October 1986 (Section 671(h)(2) of Title 14 of the California Code ofRegulations). The Department feared that importation could ultimately leadto the introduction and subsequent establishment of a reproducing populationin the State's natural ecosystem with concomitant adverse results to agriculture,aquatic resources, and human health. The Department's 1986 action to prohibit importations into California hasno effect on prohibiting importations throughout the rest of the UnitedStates. If importations are not prohibited nationwide, mitten crabs couldultimately establish wild populations in other geographical areas whereappropriate environmental conditions exist. The Department's September 16, 1986, letter requested that the Serviceexamine the genus <T3>Eriocheir </T3>for possible prohibition of importation under the LaceyAct although only the Chinese mitten crab, <T3>E. sinensis, </T3>was specifically identified and discussed in thesupporting documents submitted along with the letter. The literature searchconducted by the Service in the process of developing the proposed rulethat was published on November 14, 1988, revealed that at least three additionalspecies of mitten crabs exist (Sakai 1976) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="14">_</ITAG><T3>E. japonicus, </T3>found throughout Japan from Hokkaido to Okinawa,to Vladivostok, north and east coasts of Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong;<ITAG tagnum="14">_</ITAG><T3>E. rectus, </T3>found on Taiwan and Mainland China to Macao; and <ITAG tagnum="14">_</ITAG><T3>E. leptognathus, </T3>distributed along coastal areas of the YellowSea, from Shanghai to various localities of northern Mainland China toKorea. A preponderance of information obtained in the Service's literature searchand discussions with individuals of the academic and scientific communitiesdealt with the species <T3>E. sinensis, </T3>a fact clearly reflected in the discussion below,and other documents prepared for, and in support of, this action. However,the Service is listing as injurious the entire genus <T3>Eriocheir </T3>because of the similarity of appearance of the species,and because all species have similar habits and utilize similar habitats(Felder and Wicksten pers. comm.); it is believed that all four speciesmight have the same negative impacts. <ITAG tagnum="84">Description of the Final Rule </ITAG>The regulations contained in 50 CFR Part 16 implement the Lacey Act (18U.S.C. 42) as amended. Under the terms of that law, the Secretary of theInterior is authorized to prescribe by regulation those nonindigenous wildanimals, or viable eggs thereof, which are deemed to be injurious or potentiallyinjurious to the health and welfare of human beings, to the interests ofagriculture, forestry, and horticulture, or the welfare and survival ofwildlife or wildlife resources of the United States. By this Service actionof adding the genus <T3>Eriocheir</T3> to the list of injurious fish, mollusks, and crustaceansin 50 CFR 16.13, their acquisition, importation into, or transportationbetween the continental United States, the District of Columbia, Hawaii,the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of theUnited States by any means whatsoever is prohibited except by permit forzoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes, or by Federalagencies without a permit solely for their own use upon filing a writtendeclaration with the District Director of Customs at the port of entry.In addition, no live mitten crab, viable eggs, or progeny thereof acquiredunder permit may be sold, donated, traded, loaned, or transferred to anyother person unless such person has a permit issued by the Director ofthe Service. The interstate transportation of any live mitten crabs orviable eggs thereof that currently may be held in the United States forpurposes such as aquaculture propagation or for human consumption, or forany purpose not otherwise permitted, would be prohibited.<ITAG tagnum="84">Distribution </ITAG>The Chinese mitten crab is indigenous to the temperate zone in easternAsia, including the east coast of Mainland China from Fuchien Provincein the south, northward along the coast of the Yellow Sea, and around thewest coast of the Korean Peninsula (Panning 1938). Although the speciesapparently prefers the coastal areas of China and Korea, it is also foundupstream in river systems at considerable distances from coastal areas.For example, in the Yangtse-kiang River it occurs more than 800 miles upstream(Schmitt 1965), and in Germany's Elbe River they have been found more than400 miles from the coast (Christiansen 1969). As just alluded to, the Chinese mitten crab also occurs, as an introducedspecies, throughout the coastal areas and many river systems of temperatecentral Europe and cold-temperate northern Europe according to Panning(1938). He reported that the first Chinese mitten crab was taken in 1912from Germany's Aller River, a tributary of the Weser River with a confluenceapproximately 60 miles from the North Sea, and surmised that the specieswas first introduced into Europe between 1900 and 1910 with the releaseinto German coastal areas of ship's ballast water containing larvae takenon board in Chinese ports. During the next two decades the crab expandedthroughout Germany. By the 1930's it had moved westward into The Netherlands,Belgium, and northern France (<T3>ibid</T3>., Wolff and Sandee 1971) and eastward into Denmark, Norway,Sweden, Finland, and Poland (<T3>ibid</T3>., Grabda 1973, Christiansen 1977). Ingle and Andrews (1976)discussed the first three isolated collections of the crab in Great Britain:Chelsea (London) in the Thames River in 1935; in the Southfields Reservoirnear Castleford in 1949; and three individual crabs in the Thames Riverapproximately 20 miles downstream from London in 1976. They believed the1976 collections arrived in Great Britain in the ballast water of shipsarriving from European ports, but did ``* * * not constitute a seriousinvasion by the species.'' However, Clark (1984) described a number ofsubsequent findings of the crab in Great Britain including annual sightingsfrom the Humber and Ancholme Rivers (approximately 150 miles north of London)from 1976 through 1979, and again in 1984. Additionally, Clark reportedthat sixteen more specimens were collected from the Thames River subsequentto the 1976 account of Ingle and Andrews. It seems apparent from the accounts,therefore, that the species commonly occurs along coastal areas and intomany river systems of northern Europe from France to Norway; it may beestablished in Great Britain although this has not been conclusively statedin the literature.  Several known collections of the crab have occurred in North America. Nepszyand Leach (1973) reported the first collection of the species from theDetroit River (between Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie) in 1965, while threemore specimens were taken from commercial gillnets in Lake Erie in 1973.Theorized to have been brought to North America, as in Europe, in the ballastof cargo ships, they offered the opinion (p. 1910) that:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * [Although] the crab is unlikely to become established in LakeErie or the Upper Great Lakes [presumably because of natural and artificialbarriers that would impede migrations to salt water for reproductive purposes]accidental introduction to an estuarine system might permit it to becomeestablished in North America. The crab is a lowland form that needs notonly sea or brackish water for its propagation but also the mouths of largerivers not subject to strong currents [which evidently facilitates upstreammigration] * * * The normal habitat of the adults in Europe is the bottomsand banks of freshwater rivers and estuaries; individuals prefer hard bottomand areas covered with submerged plants, which are the main food source* * * in Europe, it bypasses obstacles such as dams and survives up to38 days in wet meadows * * *</ITAG>A live Chinese mitten crab was taken from a crab trap in Louisiana's MississippiRiver Delta in early 1987 (Felder pers. comm.). It is not yet known ifthis individual animal represents a widespread infestation or an isolatedincident, and the crab's origin is unknown. No other sightings or collectionsare known to have occurred since this 1987 finding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Biology </ITAG>Grzimek (1974) includes the Chinese mitten crab in the Suborder Brachyura,Family Grapsidae (rock crabs). In apparent recognition of the hair coveringthe species' claws, it is variously referred to as the wool crab (<T3>ibid.</T3>), Chinese mitten crab, mitten crab, and hairy-fisted crab(Ingle 1980). The species varies in color from grayish-green to dark brownwith ``* * * the carapace subsquare, a little broader than long with lateralmargins slightly curved, rather convex in longitudinal direction, frontscarcely deflexed.'' (p. 96) (Christiansen 1969). Nepszy and Leach (1973)stated that the four crabs taken in Lake Erie and the Detroit River hadcarapace lengths of 57 to 64 mm. and carapace widths of 65 to 74 mm. Theirweights ranged from 124 to 201 grams.Panning (1938) discussed reproduction by the species (pp. 365-366) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The mitten crab is, during its whole life, practically a fresh-wateranimal and is found hundreds of kilometers upstream in thickly infestedrivers. With the development of the sex instinct, the urge for the seaalso awakens in them, and in August, or after, they leave their feedinggrounds, often located far inland, to move on downstream to the sea. Thesex organs develop during this migration and the crabs reach puberty onthe last lap of the journey through the usually brackish water in the tidalregions. In the fall they always gather to breed in large swarms in thebrackish water in the lower course of the river * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The eggs are laid within 24 hours after mating and are fastened tothe small hairs on the pleopods on the underside of the abdomen with acementlike substance which hardens in salt water. This cementlike substancehardens only in water that has a salt content of more than 2.5 percent,according to F. Buhk. The females, burdened with the weight of the eggson the pleopods under their abdomens, choose to stay on in the deep wateroutside the river mouths through the winter. As soon as it gets warm inthe spring the tiny larvae escape from the eggs to start to drift aboutfree * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In all probability the females hunt up particularly brackish waterfor this purpose. In June or July, after all the larvae have left the eggs,both males and females set out for the river banks at the mouths of therivers, where they gradually perish.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The intermittent stay in fresh water, and these long journeys farinland between birth and death, which both take place in salt water, bringabout the peculiar character of the life cycle of these mitten crabs. Theycannot repeat these long journeys to reproduce every year or two, whichother crawfishes do, because the distances are too great. Breeding has,therefore, been put off to the last part of their life span. But undernormal circumstances this single breeding period is compensated by an enormousegg production * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Whereas the eggs need pure salt water to mature, the larvae leavethe eggs in very brackish water * * * These larvae probably move graduallyinto less brackish water * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This migration from salt to fresh water in the larval stage and fromfresh water to salt water as adults toward the end of their life, is adistinguishing habit of the mitten crab * * *</ITAG>Panning attributed the upstream migration into waters beyond tidal influenceto the tremendous number of crabs and inadequate forage. He reported thatthe species is omnivorous; it primarily eats vegetable matter althougha portion of its diet includes  ``* * * worms, * * * mussels and snails,inferior crustaceans, water insects, insect larvae, and * * * dead * ** organic [matter] * * *'' (pg. 371). He also stated that the crab consumesfish trapped in nets although a study of the stomach contents of 1,000crabs revealed only four or five with fish in them; it was not determinedwhether these remains were of netted, free-swimming, or dead fish.<ITAG tagnum="84">Control</ITAG>Several methods of controlling mitten crabs in Europe are described inliterature sources; apparently, none of these methods are completely effectivein controlling their migratory movements or geographical spread. It isdoubtful that these methods would be any more practical or effective inthe United States than they are in Europe.Panning (1938) has stated that, once established, control of mitten crabsis best effected just below barriers (e.g., dams) that obstruct their upstreammigrations. As the crabs leave the water in efforts to bypass the barriers,they are directed by means of sheet metal into collection pits. He alsostated that crabs moving upstream and downstream were collected at damsfrom eel basket pots. In Germany during 1936 and 1937, nearly 580,000 poundsand 420,000 pounds, respectively, were collected by these methods. Othermeans of control were not considered by Panning to be efficacious. Morerecently, Halsband (1968) described the use in Germany of electrical screensinstalled on river bottoms to block the movements of crabs during migration;electrical pulses at a frequency of 30-40 per minute were found to disable,then kill the crabs. Schmitt (1965) reported that efforts were unsuccessfulin Europe to market the large numbers of migrating crabs collected fromriver systems. Panning (1938) mentioned that crabs taken in Germany wereused to feed pigs, ducks and fish; these uses, however, were unprofitableand other more economically viable, but unidentified, solutions were beingsought.In mainland China where availability fluctuates, the species is commerciallyharvested from November through February. Until their recent listing byCalifornia as a prohibited species, Chinese mitten crabs were known tohave been imported legally into that State and sold at $10-15 per poundas a specialty, live-food item at small Asian-American food markets inthe San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas. Their apperance in food marketswas sporadic (California Department of Fish and Game 1986). No informationis currently available to indicate that live crabs are either importedfor sale as a live food item in Asian-American food markets in other States,or produced in aquaculture in the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">Affected Environment</ITAG>The average yearly surface temperature (extending down to 100 meters) ofwater in the Yellow Sea off the coast of mainland China and Korea is approximately15 to 25 degrees centigrade, while the average yearly surface temperaturein the North and Baltic Seas in Northern Europe and Scandinavia is approximately10 to 15 degrees centigrade (Williams <T3>et al</T3>. 1960). According to this source, these same average temperaturesexist along most of North America's coastal areas, from Nova Scotia toFlorida in the East, and from British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islandsouth to the Baja Peninsula in the West. The average yearly surface temperatureof water in the Gulf of Mexico is given as approximately 25 degrees centigrade.Additionally and as previously stated, during the reproductive processhardening of the substance that cements the eggs to the pleopods occursin water with a salt content greater than 2.5 percent (interpreted to mean25 parts per thousand), a factor that would not be likely to significantlyrestrict establishment and expansion of the species into estuaries andupstream into wide, slow moving river streams of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">Literature Cited </ITAG>Citations for all references listed in this Proposed Rule appear in theEnvironmental Assessment, copies of which are available by contacting theindividual identified in the section above entitled <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.'' </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Need for the Proposed Rule_Environmental Consequences </ITAG>The Service believes this final rule is needed based on currently availableevidence which suggests that importation of live mitten crabs or viableeggs thereof, their release, and subsequent establishment of naturallyreproducing populations in ecosystems of the United States could pose areal, or potential, threat of undetermined extent to the interests of agriculture,human health and safety, and existing fish and wildlife resources as follows:1. Agriculture: Mitten crabs could destroy levee systems and earth fillirrigation canals as a result of their burrowing behavior. The speciesis known to seriously undermine streambanks and earthen levee and irrigationsystems. According to Chivers (1986), it has caused millions of dollarsof damage to dikes in Germany and The Netherlands as a result of its burrowingbehavior. Their tunnels, which may number up to 30 per square meter, arebelieved to provide protection from birds and other crabs during the moultingprocess (Ingle 1986). Extensive burrowing activities over time could resultin the collapse of riverbanks or levees with significant impacts likelyto occur to the interests of agriculture. 2. Human health and safety: Mitten crabs serve as an intermediate hostto the Oriental lung fluke <T3>Paragonimus westermani.</T3> Human beings are final hosts in the lifecycle of this internal parasite that commonly occurs throughout the Orient.The Chinese mitten crab provides an essential link in the life cycle ofthe Oriental lung fluke, <T3>P. westermani,</T3> by serving as a second intermediate host of theparasite. <T3>P. westermani </T3>is not known to exist in the United States althoughthe closely related lung fluke <T3>P. kellicotti</T3> has been found in pigs and cats in South Carolina,Mississippi, and Louisiana (Nash pers. comm.). According to Burch (pers.comm.), freshwater snails of the Family Thiaridae (several species of whichhave been introduced into Hawaii, Florida, Texas, and Arizona) and theclosely related Family Pleuroceridae (representatives of which are nativeto the United States and common in the South) serve as first intermediatehosts of the fluke. Mammals, including humans, dogs, cats, raccoons, opossums,and fox could serve as final hosts. Common in Asia, <T3>P. westermani </T3>is transmitted in raw or undercooked crab meat orin the crab's body fluids. Schmitt (1965) states (pg. 184):<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * in countries where the lung fluke is prevalent it is a greaterscourge than the hookworm. Not only does it invade the lungs, producinga chronic cough, blood spitting, and an anemic condition, but it penetratesthe brain as well, giving rise to * * * afflictions that have been variouslydiagnosed as infantile paralysis, cerebral hemorrhage, encephalitis * **</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>P. westermani</T3> is also known to move to the heart in severe infestationssuch as when it is undiagnosed and, according to Durio (pers. comm.), bothheart and brain infestations can cause death. 3. Wildlife resources: Mitten crabs are an intermediate host to the Orientallung fluke <T3>P. westermani.</T3> As with humans, a number of wildlife species couldbecome infected with the lung fluke and function in the life cycle of theparasite as final hosts. 4. Fish resources: Mitten crabs could provide interspecific competitionto indigenous crustaceans resulting in the displacement of these nativespecies. It has been stated that the species could prove harmful to nativecrustaceans and other aquatic resources (Parnell 1986), presumably by competingfor available food resources, or as stated by Wicksten (1986) by introducingdiseases and parasites (other than the lung fluke) for which native specieswould show little or no tolerance. Information on the impacts of introducing the mitten crab in the UnitedStates is generally incomplete and unavailable at this time. Unless actuallyintroduced and established in the United States, the long-term effectson agriculture, human health and safety, and existing fish and wildliferesources are not known. Based on the history of other exotic introductionsand the ecology of the mitten crab, its introduction into the United Statesshould be avoided. The Service has determined that addition of mitten crabsand viable eggs thereof to the list of injurious fish, mollusks, and crustaceansin 50 CFR 16.13 is the only means available to achieve this result. <ITAG tagnum="84">Required Determinations </ITAG>An assessment of the environmental effects of the proposal to list mittencrabs as injurious was prepared and a determination made on October 24,1988, that it is not a major Federal action under the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. The comments submitted to the Service in response to our November14, 1988, proposed rule provided no new information on environmental impactsthat might be expected or attributable to this action; it has been determined,therefore, that the October 24, 1988, ``Finding of No Significant Impact''for the Environmental Assessment is still a valid finding for this finalrule. It has also been determined that this is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291. In addition, the best available information indicates thatno live mitten crabs or viable eggs thereof are known to be imported forhuman consumption, or propagated at aquaculture facilities, and this finalrule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Although the prohibitionsimposed by this final rule will not significantly affect the human environmentin the United States, the importation and spread of mitten crabs, withoutimposing these restrictions, could pose potential adverse impacts on agriculture,human health and safety, and fish and wildlife resources. Since data onthe impacts of mitten crabs on the resources of the United States are incompleteand unavailable, a rigorous evaluation of impacts is not possible. The Environmental Assessment, the Determination of Effects of Rule, theproposed rule, and all other supporting documents are available for publicinspection during regular business hours of 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday, at the Service's Division of Fish and Wildlife ManagementAssistance, Room 840, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. <ITAG tagnum="84">Information Collection Requirements </ITAG>This final rule contains no information collection requirements for whichOffice of Management and Budget approval is required under the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Author </ITAG>The author of this final rule is Jeffrey Lorenz Horwath, Wildlife Biologist,Division of Fish and Wildlife Management Assistance, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 16 </ITAG>Fish, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation,Wildlife.
