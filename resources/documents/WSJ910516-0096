The plan, disclosed by agency Chairman William Seidmanyesterday, is another sign of the Resolution Trust Corp.'sdifficulties in selling real estate and related loans amid acapital crunch and real estate slump. All of the assets thatwould be sold in this fashion have been on the market for atleast six months, with no takers.</LP><TEXT>   Investors have balked at the take-it-or-leave-it salesterms that aim to ensure fairness in evaluating bids, butleave little room for structuring more-creative deals. &quot;Thisis what we are hearing over and over from investors,&quot; saidLamar Kelly, who is in charge of asset sales for the RTC. Theagency also believes it can attract better bids on the pooledassets than on individual assets, if it is flexible in itsterms.   Under its plan, the agency would &quot;prequalify&quot; about 30large investors, mostly institutions, that have expressed aninterest in large pools of assets and that have a trackrecord in improving ailing real estate.   After an initial round of bidding on sales price, theagency would negotiate the financing and other details withthe top bidders. The agency expects most of the deals tospread the risk and return between the investor and thegovernment.   The agency's board is expected to vote on the policy nextweek, but it is already in the midst of three separate deals,for sales totaling $1.2 billion, in real estate-relatedassets under the new terms, Mr. Seidman said. The agencywouldn't identify the investors, because the transactionshaven't been completed.   The transactions may be controversial on Capitol Hill,because in the final stages, they involve one-on-onenegotiations rather that putting the assets out for thehighest-competitive bid. &quot;We aren't doing these in a darkcloset, alone with one bidder,&quot; Mr. Kelly said. &quot;These assetshave all been widely marketed.&quot;   A likely transaction, a spokesman said, would call for thebuyer to provide at least 15% of the sales price, and thenreceive the cash generated from the property, until theinvestor's down payment is recouped. Then, for a secondphase, the agency would receive the cash flow produced by theproperty, until its interest is paid up. Eventually, theproperty winds up with the buyer.   Already, some investors are circling. Last week, theBlackstone Group, New York, led by Peter G. Peterson, said itwas joining as the capital partner with J.E. Robert Cos.,Alexandria, Va., to invest roughly $450 million in such jointventures.   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady yesterdayrequested that the investigative arm of Congress provide theTreasury with examples of failures in the RTC's internalcontrols and asset management. According to a letter from Mr.Brady, the General Accounting Office has informed theTreasury that the GAO will cite problems with the RTC'sinternal controls in its 1990 RTC audit, due next month. Mr.Brady requested, by May 24, specific examples of RTC failuresin order to &quot;correct any problems in the operation of theRTC.&quot;   In an earlier report on the Sandamp;L agency, the GAO citedsimilar accounting and management concerns, but didn'tprovide examples.</TEXT></DOC>
