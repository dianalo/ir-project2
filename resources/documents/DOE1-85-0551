The antihemopoietic effect could not be ascribedto a direct infection of stem cells. The failure in hemopoiesis was preventedby adoptive transfer of antiviral CD8+ T lymphocytes and could be overcomeby syngeneic bone marrow transplantation. CD8+ T lymphocytes and bonemarrow cells both mediated survival, although only CD8+ T lymphocyteswere able to limit virus multiplication in host tissues. We concludedthat not the cytopathic effect of virus replication in host tissues,but the failure in hemopoiesis, is the primary cause of death in murineCMV disease.</TEXT></DOC>
