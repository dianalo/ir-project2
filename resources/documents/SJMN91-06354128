GM's announcement of theelimination of 24,000 jobs next year and 74,000 during the next four years andthe closing of 21 plants was a response to the weak economy as well.;   Butthe GM cuts also highlighted a parallel phenomenon: A host of corporations aremaking painful personnel cuts to cope better with intense competition and costpressures. Many of the thousands of jobs being shed are gone for good.;   &quot;Donot confuse cyclical fluctuations with powerful structural forces that are nowaffecting the very fabric of our social order,&quot; Stephen S. Roach, a senioreconomist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., said in testimony prepared for the sameHouse committee that heard Greenspan.;   Neither recessions nor corporatedownsizing are new to the U.S. economy, but the extent of their intersectionthis time has sent consumer confidence down a steep slope and has added to thepolitical pressure on President Bush to propose economic solutions.;  Thousands of jobs lost;   In the last few months, such major corporateemployers as International Business Machines Corp.; Unisys Corp.; Xerox Corp.;McDonnell Douglas Corp.; Sears, Roebuck and Co.; Tenneco Inc.; WestinghouseElectric Corp.; TRW Inc.; Chemical Banking Corp.; and Manufacturers HanoverCorp. have announced the termination of thousands of jobs.;   &quot;What manycompanies did is prepare contingency plans during 1991&quot; for downsizing, saidGarrett Dietz, a vice president at the management consulting firm TowersPerrin. &quot;What with us not coming out of the recession as quickly as somethought we would, they have put those contingency plans into effect.&quot;;  During the summer, economic statistics began turning upward, and experts,including Greenspan, began saying the recession that began in July 1990appeared to be dissipating. Since then, housing and retail sales have weakenedfurther. Last month, the nation's employers reduced their payrolls by 241,000workers, nearly as many jobs as were disappearing during the recessionmonths.;   Consumer confidence falls;   Consumer confidence, meanwhile,plummeted. Last month, it fell below the lowest point it reached in the 1982recession, a downturn that by the numbers was much more severe. Nationalunemployment hit 10.8 percent then; this time it is just less than 7 percent.;  Greenspan acknowledged the apparent discrepancy between numbers andperception Wednesday, saying, &quot;There is a deep-seated concern out there that Ihave not seen in my lifetime in the context of an economy that is not all thatbad.&quot;;   As an explanation, he noted high consumer and business debt levelsand troubles in the real estate and banking sectors. Analysts said Wednesdaythat the steady drumbeat of layoff announcements also may be adding to thegloom -- with no end in sight.;   In past recessions, manufacturers have laidoff workers and idled plants with the assumption that they would be revivedwhen the economy improved. GM's announcement Wednesday, however, portrayed theloss of blue- and white-collar jobs as a permanent restructuring.;   Not firstGM reduction;   This is far from the first downsizing effort for GM.Manufacturers spent much of the 1980s streamlining to meet global competition.In the last year or so, many of the layoff announcements have come from theservice sector, a portion of the economy that grew even during the 1982recession and, some say, became badly bloated in the 1980s.;   The layoffannouncements &quot;have a permanent feel to them,&quot; said Mickey Levy, chiefeconomist of CRT Government Securities in New York.;   But experts saidWednesday that, to the extent the job cutbacks are a result of changes in theeconomy's structure, it is unlikely that government efforts to nudge theeconomy into faster growth can be effective. Even if the Federal Reservereduces interest rates further, for instance, GM is not likely to restore manyof the jobs it has pared. Nor would the $300-per-taxpayer rebate beingconsidered by the Bush administration do much to add jobs, they said.;   &quot;Froma public policy point of view, if the economy is sputtering because ofstructural impediments, then tools to stimulate demand are not going to beeffective,&quot; Levy said.; UNDER THE AX; GM's plan to eliminate 74,000 jobs by1995 is the latest in a rush of job-cutting announcements:; (box)Dec. 11:Xerox Corp. says it will eliminate 2,500 jobs through attrition, voluntaryseverance and layoffs, to cut costs.; (box)Dec. 4: Du Pont Co. says it willcut at least 10,000 jobs within the next five years for cost-cuttingpurposes.; (box)Dec. 4: Tenneco Inc. says its JI Case farm equipment unit willlay off 4,000 employees.; (box)Dec. 4: Pan American World Airways shuts down,throwing 7,500 people out of work.; (box)Nov. 26: International BusinessMachines Corp. will cut 20,000 positions worldwide in 1992 to counter therecession and stiff competition.; (box)Nov. 22: McDonnell Douglas Corp. laysoff 2,200 workers in Long Beach and Torrance in its Douglas Aircraft unit.;(box)Nov. 14: Midway Airlines closes, putting up to 4,300 people out of work.;(box)July 25: Digital Equipment Corp. plans to eliminate 10,000 jobs in thefiscal year ending next June 30.; (box)July 23: After reporting asecond-quarter loss of $1.3 billion, Unisys Corp. announces 10,000 will losetheir jobs over the next year.; Source: Mercury News  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANNE SWARDSON, Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911219  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,076  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 19, 199100354128,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
