The storms swept through Oklahoma and Louisiana as well, butwith lesser effect.   In the East, heavy rains dropped up to three-fourths of an inchof rain per hour on northern New Jersey, triggering flash floodwatches for New York City and Philadelphia.   Sunny skies prevailed from Florida to the southern Appalachians,the Ohio Valley and the upper Great Lakes region, and in theSouthwest. The Pacific Northwest had partly cloudy skies.   The Southwest storms spun off tornadoes that touched downnorthwest of Abilene, Texas and near McAlister, N.M., and Menard,Texas. A twister occurred near Longview, Texas. No major injuriesor damage were reported.   More than 11 inches of rain fell in Antelope, Texas, northwestof Fort Worth, and more than 5 inches fell along the Red Riverdividing the Lone Star State from Oklahoma, flooding roads andhomes in some places. Winds hit up to 100 mph.   Gainesville, a city of about 14,000 people about 60 milesnorthwest of Dallas, was among the hardest hit by the storm.   National Guardsmen from the city helped evacuate about 150 homesin low-lying areas threatened by floods, said state Trooper M.Dial. Most of the evacuees were taken out by boat. Emergencyshelters were set up at two churches.   Flooding forced the evacuation of the city's Frank Buck Zoo, but18 deer were missing, said Milburn Cravens, Gainesville's directorof community services.   Ninety-five percent of the animals, including zebras andostriches, were taken to a cattle auction barn. Cravens said hehoped the deer would return to the zoo on their own.   Dial earlier said some animals were lost, but officials saidthere were no known animal deaths or injuries.   Storm-sparked fires destroyed two mobile homes, the trooper said.   Flooding blocked Interstate 35 south of Gainesville and U.S. 82inside the city for a short time. High water also blocked roads inBaylor, Jack and Archer counties west of Gainesville.   In Callisburg, about 10 miles northeast of Gainesville, windsflipped a mobile home, slightly injuring two women, the CookeCounty Sheriff's Department said.   West of Gainesville, hail as big as baseballs fell. Hail up togolf ball-size fell near the town of Robert Lee in southwest Texasand near Gruver, Okla., in the Oklahoma Panhandle.   In Fannin County, Texas, about 50 miles northeast of Dallas,hail caused several thousand dollars in damages, officials said.   ``Just about every house in Bonham that had windows on the westside had the panes shattered by the hail,'' said county CivilDefense Director David Norris. The hail smashed skylights, carwindows and windshields.   At the Sam Rayburn Veterans Administration Center in the town ofabout 7,200 people, patients were temporarily moved between floorsso workers could mop up rainwater that leaked through thestorm-damaged roof.   Northwest Louisiana also had heavy rain. Zwolla had more than 6inches of rain and Stanley had more than 5.   Flash flood watches were in effect in northwest Louisiana,northeast and north central Texas and southwest Oklahoma.   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 95 at Avon Park,Fla. The nation's low Tuesday morning was 25 degrees in Truckee,Calif.
