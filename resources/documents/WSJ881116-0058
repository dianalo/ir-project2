Weiss </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ARO </IN><G> EXE DEF </G><TEXT>   President-elect George Bush has told the American people that he favors deficit reductions, a strong defense and no new taxes. For such a blueprint to have a chance, his single most important appointment will be that of defense secretary.    Defense is central for a number of reasons. The sheer volume of dollars passing through the department annually -- close to $300 billion -- affects not only fiscal policy but also the business climate in whole sectors of American industry. The Pentagon also is involved in arms control, base treaties and other aspects of diplomacy.    Now a budget crisis looms at Defense. The department has locked itself into $300 billion to $500 billion in new spending over the next five years over and above the level it is even remotely likely to get under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. A wholly different source of cost pressure is the cost of &quot;get-well&quot; money for much of the military equipment that has been purchased -- ranging from the MX missile and B-1 bomber to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Beretta pistol. Still more upward pressure on costs comes from maintenance and support costs for the new equipment, costs that are rising much faster than Defense planned for.    The Bush administration faces a lose-lose proposition of shrinking forces at higher costs when fiscal pressures are greatest. The problem is exacerbated by all the &quot;political engineering&quot; of defense contracts -- spreading the money around in lots of congressional districts. This makes programs next to impossible to turn off, even when they produce substandard, obsolete or unnecessary products.    Moreover, the planning and budgeting process at Defense is so deeply flawed with consistently underestimated costs and consistently overestimated revenue that more money won't solve the problems.    Something, or rather a lot of somethings, are going to have to give.    One tough secretary of defense is called for. Mr. Bush will need someone who is:   1.Completely in his confidence. The president must trust the secretary's judgment and be willing to spend political capital backing his decisions.    2.Politically conservative. Whoever's chosen needs to be ideologically comfortable with the president and his advisers.    3.Aware of the pressures inside the Pentagon. Defense is not going to get out of the planning and budget crunch if the new secretary lacks insights into what got us into it.    4.Ready to address, from day one, the Defense Department's unfunded commitments. The department has been making down payments on expensive programs for more than 10 years. These bills are coming due. The longer it takes to address this, the higher the bills will mount.    5.Strongly committed to maintaining troop readiness. No &quot;raiding&quot; this part of the budget, creating a force that can't fight. Secretary Carlucci has had the right instincts on this issue.    6.Willing to &quot;just say no&quot; and stick to it. Every branch of the service, nearly every Defense Department acquisition program and most major Pentagon activities have powerful constituencies that will work hard to block any cuts or terminations. The first time the secretary reverses a significant decision in the face of this pressure, the floodgates will open on every other decision. James Schlesinger was particularly strong in this &quot;courage of his convictions&quot; department.    7.Experienced in the ways of Congress. Probably our best recent Pentagon chief was Melvin Laird, a former House member who understood the Defense Department-congressional nexus clearly. Another very good one was Clark Clifford, who had similar political skills. Among potential nominees mentioned, Rep. Dick Cheney and former Rep. Jack Edwards would fill this bill.    8.Willing to hire a &quot;turnaround&quot; specialist from the business community as deputy secretary. The deputy holds the top operational job in the building. The job is going to require someone with Paul O'Neill, Ross Perot, John Sculley or Don Peterson-like skills at turning a big organization around and getting it to produce better &quot;products and services&quot; at lower costs. Recall David Packard under Mr. Laird.    9.People-oriented. The greatest untapped assets at the Pentagon are the people who work for it. No one is more knowledgeable about problems inside the department. The trick is to develop as many channels of communication as possible up to the secretary, and then promote and encourage the people who are offering the most constructive advice.    One action the new secretary could take first thing to communicate a seriousness about getting the weapons capabilities that we have been paying for, and to crack down on poorly performing equipment, would be to select a director of operational test and evaluation who will do the job Congress mandated. Honest, rigorous weapons testing is fundamental if we are to seriously address the problem of unfunded purchasing commitments and the rising maintenance and repair costs. A tough weapons tester would clearly communicate, &quot;If the equipment doesn't work, we're not buying it.&quot;    No one candidate for secretary will have all these qualities. But the key is having someone who understands that &quot;business-as-usual&quot; will greatly accelerate Pentagon problems. The worst choice would be someone who helped create the current problems in the department, or who has a major personal stake in some of the existing programs and practices.    ---   Mr. Weiss is chairman of American Minerals Inc. and Business Executives for National Security. </TEXT></DOC>
