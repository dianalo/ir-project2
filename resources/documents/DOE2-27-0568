It has been shown onthe basis of comparative tests, in which laboratories in Europe, Japanand USA have participated, that with regard to power of detection aswell as reproducibility even at levels below 500 ng/g neutron activationanalysis (INAA, RNAA), wet chemical multi-step procedures and GDMS cancontribute to the characterization of high-purity aluminium. The measurementof the resistivity ratio have proved as a suitable test for the integralcontent of dissolved impurities. H at levels of 0.3 {mu}g/g can be measuredby vacuum solid extraction or carrier gas fusion. For a complete andoptimal characterization of high-purity aluminium all these methods areneeded and should periodically be checked against each other.</TEXT></DOC>
