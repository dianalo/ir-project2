The same survey of 944 Jews found that younger respondents wereless attached to Israel than were older members of their faith.   That rift extended to criticism of Israel's West Bank policies:26 percent of those between 55 and 64 said they felt Israel treatsWest Bank Arabs unfairly, compared with 42 percent of those under 45.   The survey was conducted for the American Jewish Committee duringJanuary and February. It is not a random survey; the questions weremailed to Jews on a list compiled by Market Facts, a market researchcompany. Sociologist Steven M. Cohen conducted the poll.   Of those surveyed, 65 percent said Israel had used ``reasonableand appropriate'' force _ with the exception of ``a few regrettableincidents'' _ to put down the Palestinian uprising, and 79 percentfelt that Israel was treated unfairly by the press.   But 54 percent said they felt that the Israelis acted wrongly, atleast to some extent, and 43 percent said they were at leastsomewhat embarrassed by Israel's actions. Fifty-one percent saidthey were in no way morally outraged by what Israel had done; 35percent felt some outrage.   Twenty-two percent said Israel should annex the West Bank, but 38percent would return land to the Arabs in exchange for peace _ thesame number who support U.S. talks with the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   Fifty-eight percent said Israel should talk with the PLO if thegroup recognizes Israel and renounces terrorism.</TEXT></DOC>
