Volvo said its new 900 series would be followed by thelaunch of at least one other new model family by 1995.Swedish archrival Saab Automobile AB -- in which GeneralMotors Corp. holds a 50% stake -- also plans to introducethree new car models by the mid-1990s. The pace is unheard offor the two Swedish companies, at which the traditional rateof model debuts has been closer to one a decade.</LP><TEXT>   But officials at Volvo and Saab admit the lack of excitingnew cars has intensified a recent sales slump and caused bothto lose ground to more nimble rivals, such as BayerischeMotoren Werke AG and Daimler-Benz AG. The German car giantshave replaced almost their entire model ranges in recentyears. For Volvo and Saab, the challenge of catching up willbe complicated further by the arrival in earnest of theJapanese in Europe, the officials said.   Roger Holtback, president of Volvo's car division, warnedthat intensifying competition from Japanese rivals promises&quot;to make Europe the auto industry's main battleground in the1990s. We know that other Japanese companies will join HondaMotor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. in settingup manufacturing operations in Europe,&quot; he said.   Volvo's response must be more frequent model changes,despite the soaring costs of developing new models, Mr.Holtback added. He also promised that the drive for growth inEurope would steer design of new Volvo models. That strategyaddresses frequent criticism in Europe of Volvos for beingprimarily styled for tastes in the U.S., the company'sbiggest single market.   The European slant is apparent in the sleek, rounded linesof Volvo's most luxurious 960 model, which breaks with theboxy profile of Volvo's previous exclusive model, theeight-year-old 760. But an even bigger surprise rests underthe hood -- a powerful 3-liter, six-cylinder engine which Mr.Holtback compared favorably with high-performance engines ofany other European luxury-car maker.   Industry analysts agreed that the new engine probablywould be the first from Volvo muscular enough to earn seriousrespect from performance-minded car buyers in central Europe.But these analysts added that Volvo could have problemscultivating a more performance-oriented image among Europeancar buffs without driving away existing customers.   Many Volvo buyers prize the company's image as anultra-safe family car with a quirky cachet and high resalevalue. Reflecting that performance-safety balancing act,Volvo equipped the 960 model with an elaborate built-inchild-restraint seat, which it said was a first for any carmaker.   As proof of how serious Volvo is about quicker modelchanges, Mr. Holtback boasted that development of the new 900series had been completed in just two years. But it cost ahefty 2 billion Swedish kronor ($350 million). The newmodel's engine and transmission were the first in a newdrive-train program that when completed will have swallowedat least six years and an estimated 6 billion kronor, Mr.Holtback suggested.   Moreover, the advent of the 900 series leaves Volvo withfive model families. According to Mr. Holtback &quot;that'sobviously a broader product range than we need for the timebeing. The message we're giving customers and dealers is thatin the coming five years we will reduce the number of modelfamilies to three with more distinct profiles.&quot;   The 900 series will be one obvious survivor; so will thethe mid-size 400 series model produced by Netherlands-basedaffiliate Volvo Car BV. Volvo is negotiating to acquire the70% it doesn't already own of Volvo Car BV from the Dutchgovernment.   The third model is almost certain to be the 600 series, along-awaited successor to Volvo's big-selling, 25-year-old200 series. Most analysts expect the 600 series to debut nextfall. Volvo refuses to discuss possible model changes in linewith company policy.   Whenever it comes, the 600 looms as a make-or-breakproduct decision, analysts said. Buoyant sales of the newmodel will be necessary to meet Volvo's internal growthtarget -- to 500,000 cars a year by 1996 from roughly 410,000units now.   Costs of developing the new 900 and expected 600 modelshave stretched Volvo, eating into the car division'soperating profit in recent years amid dwindling sales inSweden, the U.K. and the U.S. The three markets account for70% of the company's sales.   Mr. Holtback predicted that by the mid-1990s, Volvo'salliance with France's Renault &quot;will kick in as an insurancepolicy.&quot; He predicted that tighter links with Renault andexpanded Volvo manufacturing operations outside Sweden wouldensure a strong position in Europe. And joint developmentwork on major components would help both concerns bear theskyrocketing costs of surviving the fierce competitionexpected in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
