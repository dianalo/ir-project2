But U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding said that couldbe brought about only ``through a long process of quiet and patientdiplomacy'' in which many governments and organizations would haveto take part.   Officials in Israel, which last week captured a Moslem cleric,Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, reiterated today there would be noexchange of captives unless three Israeli servicemen were part ofthe swap.   ``If we won't get the Israelis, there won't be a deal,'' saidIsraeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel in Jerusalem.Right-wing legislators also called for retaliation if any Israeliswere harmed.   Kidnappers holding U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio on Sundayoffered to release him immediately if Israel frees Obeid and 450Arab prisoners and allows 55 Palestinian deportees to return home.   Goulding spoke after two meetings he held in west Beirut withacting Moslem Prime Minister Salim Hoss and Sheik Mohammed HusseinFadlallah, spiritual guide of Hezbollah, or Party of God.   The Shiite Moslem fundamentalist party is believed to be theumbrella of pro-Iranian extremist factions holding most of theWestern hostages in Lebanon.   Hezbollah leader Hussein Mousawi said an Israeli soldier hisgroup holds could be killed if Obeid, kidnapped by Israelicommandos July 28, is not released.   Goulding, who heads U.N. peacekeeping operations, said he hascompleted his five-day mission in the Middle East to determinewhether U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins has been killed byhis pro-Iranian captors.   The U.N. envoy said he did not obtain any solid evidence thatHiggins is dead or alive. Higgins' captors last Monday said theykilled Higgins and released a videotape purportedly showing himhanging from a scaffold, but no body has been released.   Goulding said he would fly back to New York ``fairly soon'' toreport to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.   ``I would say without claiming to be optimistic, this issomething that many people have said to me, that there are certaintendencies, certain trends in the international climate whichsuggest that circumstances may be more conducive to a settlement tothe hostages problem now than they have been sometime in thepast,'' he said without elaborating.   Algerian Ambassador Khaled Hasnawi, who also has been trying towin the release of Western hostages, met with Hoss and later withSheik Sobhi Tofaili, a senior Hezbollah leader, but declined to sayif any progress was made.   Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham Ghandour, a secretary at theU.S. embassy in Beirut, said she felt encouraged by Sunday's offerfrom her husband's kidnappers, the Revolutionary JusticeOrganization.   However, one of Cicippio's brothers, Thomas, said fromNorristown, Pa., that he was not happy with the offer because itdid not mention freedom for the other foreigners held hostage inLebanon.   A poll released Sunday indicated that most Americans believe theUnited States should negotiate to free the hostages and shouldrefrain from bombing terrorist hideouts in Lebanon.   Of the 500 people surveyed in the Time magazine-Cable NewsNetwork poll, 58 percent support negotiations, while 39 percentoppose such talks. Asked whether they support bombing terroristhideouts if innocent people might be killed, 60 percent said no,and 33 percent said yes.   Bush reportedly asked Algeria to intercede to stop Cicippio'scaptors from killing him. But the United States has refused tonegotiate with what it considers terrorists. It takes no positionon Israel's policy of offering to negotiate with hostage-takers forthe release of captives in Lebanon.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Mexico City for aconference of U.S. and Mexican cabinet members, reiterated thepolicy Sunday when asked about the demands for Cicippio's release.   ``If the United States were to get into that game, we'd simplysee a lot more Americans taken hostage around the world,'' he said.   The proposal by Revolutionary Justice was contained in ahandwritten statement in Arabic and delivered to the independentBeirut newspaper An-Nahar. The statement was accompanied by aninstant photograph of American hostage Edward Tracy, whom the groupalso holds.   It was the first time Revolutionary Justice has said it wouldfree Cicippio, 58, a hostage since Sept. 12, 1986.   The group threatened last week to kill Cicippio if Obeid was notfreed. Israel says Obeid instigated attacks on the Jewish state.   Less than an hour before the deadline set for Cicippio's death,Revolutionary Justice said it was ``freezing'' the order andsubstituting it with an ``initiative'' calling for Obeid's releaseand freedom for Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held by Israel.   Mousawi told reporters that if the United States ``is able tohelp itself and help its hostages by stopping its support forIsrael and by not participating in anything that hurts Moslems inLebanon ... this could encourage Hezbollah to think of a way tohelp resolve the hostage issue.''   He also said some members of pro-Iranian organizations holdinghostages are ``known to us, and we hold consultations with themfrom time to time.''   It was the first time Hezbollah has publicly acknowledged it hascontacts with such groups.   Of the 16 foreigners held in Lebanon, eight are Americans. Heldlongest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani today denied a Britishnewspaper report he sent a letter to President Bush on the hostagecrisis in Lebanon. The Sunday Times of London said Rafsanjani sentthe letter last week and described its tone as conciliatory.</TEXT></DOC>
