Mass loss from the stellar surfaceand, in some cases, mass transfer from a companion enhance the opportunityto observe material that is the product of internal nuclear reactions.Detailed studies show substantial deficiencies in current models withthe timing and depth of convective and other forms of mixing. 54 references,1 figure, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
