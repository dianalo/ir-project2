How do physics and engineering constraints affectthe design of shaped tokamaks? How can the process of designing shapedtokamaks be improved? The first question is addressed with the aid ofa completely analytical procedure for optimizing the design of a resistive-magnettokamak reactor. It is shown that physics constraints---particularlythe MHD beta limits and the Murakami density limit---have an enormous,and sometimes, unexpected effect on the final design. The second questionis addressed through the development of a series of computer models forcalculating plasma equilibria, estimating poloidal field coil currents,and analyzing axisymmetric MHD stability in the presence of resistiveconductors and feedback. The models offer potential advantages over conventionalmethods since they are characterized by extremely fast computer executiontimes, simplicity, and robustness. Furthermore, evidence is presentedthat suggests that very little loss of accuracy is required to achievethese desirable features. 94 refs., 66 figs., 14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
