Precisethree-dimensional reconstruction of the heart is achieved with compositesof multiple MR sections. Its high level of accuracy makes MR imaginga tremendously useful tool in clinical workup and diagnosis, particularlywhen conventional modalities are inconclusive. The authors present sixto eight complex cases for which MR imaging information was equal orsuperior to that of conventional radiographic studies. Angiography wassometimes unnecessary, and MR imaging served as the primary diagnosticmodality. They also discuss scanning sequences, projections, and managementin pediatric patients.</TEXT></DOC>
