(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The launch of Discovery and its fiveastronauts has been delayed at least two days until March 11 becauseof a crushed electrical part on a main engine, officials said.   The delay apparently will resolve a conflict that had beenbrewing when a classified military launching threatened to bump theshuttle from its March 9 target date.   The National Aeronatics and Space Administration said Wednesdaythat during a readiness test of Discovery's three main engines, acontrol mechanism on engine No. 1 shut down prematurely. The problemwas traced to a crushed solenoid on a valve, but its cause was notknown immediately.   A replacement part was flown here and installed late Wednesday.Officials said the installation and checkout of the new unit willmean a slip of at least two days in the launch.   Shuttle managers scheduled the start of a two-day flightreadiness review today. It is to end Friday with the selection of afirm launch date.   During five days in orbit, Discovery's astronauts are to deploy alarge communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments.   On Monday, the Air Force informed NASA it had scheduled acritical military launch next week and that it would not be able tosupport a Discovery liftoff until March 11. The space agency reliesheavily on Air Force tracking facilities for a shuttle launch.   The military mission has launch priority for national securityreasons, but NASA said before the solenoid problem it was ready tonegotiate the launch date with military officials.   The Air Force launch is believed to involve a satellite to testsensors for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Star Wars missiledefense shield. Another mission scheduled soon that also would havepriority over the shuttle is the first firing of a Trident 2intercontinental range missile from a submerged submarine.</TEXT></DOC>
