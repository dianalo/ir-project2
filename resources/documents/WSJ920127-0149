Bill Clintonof Arkansas seemed to be putting together a winning campaignfor the Democratic presidential nomination. Now he's fightingfor his political life.   Mr. Clinton's plans came unstuck when a supermarkettabloid quoted former cabaret singer and television reporterGennifer Flowers as saying she had engaged in a 12-yearromance with him. The tabloid, the Star, acknowledged it paidMs. Flowers for her story.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Clinton, his wife Hillary at his side, denounced thestory as &quot;not true&quot; and, in a high-stakes gamble, mounted acounteroffensive by agreeing to tape an interview with CBS'spopular &quot;60 Minutes&quot; program to be broadcast after the SuperBowl.   In the interview with CBS, Gov. Clinton again denied hehad an affair with Miss Flowers. &quot;That allegation is false,&quot;he told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent Steve Kroft.   But the governor, conceding his marriage has gone throughtroubled times, unmistakably suggested there had beeninfidelity. &quot;I think most Americans who are watching thistonight, they'll know what we're saying, they'll get it, andthey'll feel that we have been more candid. And I think whatthe press has to decide is: Are we going to engage in a gameof `gotcha?'&quot;   &quot;You know,&quot; Mr. Clinton said, &quot;I can remember a time whena divorced person couldn't run for president and that time,thank goodness, has passed. . . . Are we going to take thereverse position now that if people have problems in theirmarriage and there are things in their past which they don'twant to discuss which are painful to them, that they can'trun?&quot;   Mrs. Clinton, a lawyer, said she didn't want to discussdetails of their marriage problems. &quot;I don't think being anymore specific about what's happened in the privacy of ourlife together is relevant to anybody besides us.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's nervous strategists hoped weekendappearances by Mr. and Mrs. Clinton on television and here inNew Hampshire would mark the end of the unseemly controversy.More than that, they hoped he could win sympathy for beingforced to defend himself against attacks in a newspaper thatspecializes in checkbook journalism and bizarre stories.   &quot;This story is over,&quot; said George Stephanapoulos, Mr.Clinton's deputy campaign manager. &quot;But,&quot; he added, voicingsome uncertainty, &quot;is the issue completely put away? That'sup to the press.&quot;   The campaign came to a dead halt late Thursday in remoteClaremont, N.H., an old mill town on the state's westernborder, when Mr. Clinton and reporters covering his campaignfirst became aware of the Star's new charges. He denied thestory in a crowded, shouting interview in the lobby of apaint-brush factory, and then closeted himself upstairs todecide what to do about it.   The answer: Fight back.   &quot;The fundamental question is: What would this country belike if every person's private life were paraded in thetabloids?&quot; asked James Carville, Mr. Clinton's seniorstrategist. &quot;Is a bought story in a supermarket tabloid goingto drive the dialogue in a presidential campaign?&quot;   That question troubles political analysts and newsexecutives in the mainstream press too. Tabloidsensationalism over the private lives of political figures ismore commonly a European phenomenon, where payments totipsters for salacious personal stories, true or not, are away of life.   Thus, the Star's stories about Mr. Clinton, which haveappeared in the paper's last two weekly editions and whichwill continue next week, mark a departure in Americanpolitics.   The Star, along with its sister publication, the NationalEnquirer, is owned by G.P. Group Inc., Lantana, Fla. G.P.Group, in turn, is owned by Macfadden Holdings Inc. andBoston Ventures L.P. The Star specializes in stories about TVcelebrities and rich and famous people; the Enquirer focuseson celebrities, human interest and health. The Starreportedly paid Miss Flowers anywhere from $50,000 to$200,000 to appear in its pages. (One national TV network wastold by a representative of Miss Flowers that she mightappear on the air -- for $100,000.)   The Star said Miss Flowers made tape recordings of some ofthe conversations she had with Gov. Clinton, in which,according to the Star, he told her to deny what the papercalled &quot;their affair&quot; if reporters asked about it. MissFlowers has scheduled a news conference in New York thisafternoon.   Doubts about Miss Flowers's credibility were raised byNewsweek magazine, among others. It will report in its Feb. 3issue several major discrepancies in Miss Flowers's story,including her claim that she met Gov. Clinton at theExcelsior Hotel in Little Rock, Ark., in 1979 or 1980. Thehotel didn't open until 1982.   But even the most sober New Hampshire political activistsacknowledge that Mr. Clinton faces a critical challenge. &quot;Ifit turns out that the man lied,&quot; says Democratic state Rep.Debora Pignatelli, who remains undecided, &quot;that would be itfor me and Clinton.&quot;   This challenge, moreover, comes at a crucial time, threeweeks before the New Hampshire primary. &quot;It's all so fragilehere,&quot; says former Democratic state chairman George Bruno,who supports Mr. Clinton. &quot;You've got to slug it out everyday. Just one story in a supermarket tabloid turns thingsaround. It's all bogus, but you've got to contend with it.&quot;   It was just this month that Mr. Clinton soared to thefront of the Democratic pack, both nationally and in NewHampshire.   Because the Democratic candidates are just beginning toemerge as distinct personalities, and because PresidentBush's campaign seems to be in such disarray, there remainsthe possibility that better-known Democrats could plunge intothe race -- New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, for example, or Sen.Lloyd Bentsen of Texas or Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.There is still time to do so: The filing deadlines havepassed for primaries and caucuses that constitute only about25% of the delegates that will be selected for the New Yorkconvention in July. Rules governing the selection ofdelegates at caucuses, moreover, are sufficiently vague thateven more delegates are available than the official figuressuggest.   But the candidates already in the race might benefit fromMr. Clinton's troubles -- Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,perhaps. In New Hampshire, if not elsewhere, former Sen. PaulTsongas of Massachusetts, who has deployed an impressiveorganization in his neighboring state, may pick up votes ifMr. Clinton begins to fade. Indeed, a New Hampshire poll byAmerican Research Group released Saturday showed Mr. Clintondropping 12 percentage points and Mr. Tsongas picking up 13percentage points, leaving the race between the two menalmost deadlocked.   Mr. Clinton began his efforts to reclaim the momentumSaturday night at a rally before a flag-waving crowd of 500supporters at the Manchester YMCA. Poised, smiling andseemingly relaxed, Bill and Hillary Clinton put on ademonstration of confidence and mutual affection.   Gov. Clinton told the Manchester crowd how heartened hewas by the turnout. He told the crowd: &quot;Nobody gets to decidewhat this election's all about but you.&quot;   The irony for Mr. Clinton is that he has tried to puttogether a serious campaign based on serious issues. Here inNew Hampshire, his campaign ads urge people to go to theirlibraries to read his detailed position papers. He hascollected the funds necessary to expand his campaignoperation and to deploy forces in states beyond NewHampshire. His campaign had been well-organized in such keystates as Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Maryland and New York.   ---   Dennis Farney in Bedford, N.H., contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
