Net income was $111.5 million, or$2.28 a share.   Despite the relatively optimistic outlook, Parker Hannifinthis fiscal year will be channeling more of its cash flowinto stock buy-backs and less into plant and equipmentspending, Mr. Schloemer said.   Parker's domestic orders for industrial products, thecompany's best barometer of U.S. economic activity, rose 7%in July from a year earlier, he said. In August they trailedyear-earlier levels by about 1%, which he said he doesn'tregard as significant. The company produces more than 200,000different products for hydraulic, pneumatic andelectromechanical motion control in a wide range ofbusinesses, giving Parker a good feel for general economicactivity.   Certain U.S. markets, such as parts for constructionmachinery and heavy trucks, are weak, Mr. Schloemer said. Andthere's less optimism about an imminent upturn in thosebusinesses than there was a few months ago. But Parker'sorders for some other industrial products, auto parts andaerospace products have increased, he said.   Orders continue to rise in most overseas markets, Mr.Schloemer said. The rate of order increase is slowing alittle in Europe, he said, but that appears to be the resultof capacity constraints at plants Parker supplies rather thana drop in demand for the end products. &quot;And Brazil is rightback on track,&quot; he said, following a period earlier this yearwhen the Brazilian government's efforts to fight inflationgreatly reduced economic activity.   Parker Hannifin directors last month authorized repurchaseof as many as three million common shares, about 6% of the 49million shares outstanding, Mr. Schloemer said. The companydoesn't expect to complete the repurchases in fiscal 1991,however, he said.   Capital spending will decline to the $80 million to $85million range, he said, from $125 million in fiscal 1990 and$149 million in 1989. &quot;We've been spending at a rather highrate, and have built a lot of new plants,&quot; Mr. Schloemersaid. As a result, the company has adequate capacity for mostproducts, and its plants are modern and efficient, he said.   Both the 1991 stock repurchases and capital spending willbe financed with internally generated cash flow, he said. Infact, the company expects to continue to reduce its debt thisyear, he added.   &quot;In the short term, we have decided that the best thing todo with our capital is to repurchase some of our stock,&quot; Mr.Schloemer said. Parker Hannifin stock has been tradingrecently at $23 to $24 a share, down more than 25% from its52-week high of $32.75.   Mr. Schloemer said the more conservative investmentapproach isn't a reflection on management's expectations forthe 1990s. He said the company is optimistic about the comingdecade. But this year sales aren't booming and the companycan invest less in facilities and still meet anticipateddemand for its products. Parker probably will be investingmore aggressively in the future to expand and upgradefacilities, he said.   Parker has increased the dividend for each of the past 34years, and the board is likely to continue that tradition,Mr. Schloemer said. The company's policy is to pay out aboutone-third of earnings in dividends, he said. The current rateis 23 cents quarterly, an increase of two cents a share fromthe 21 cents paid in each of the first two quarters of fiscal1990.</TEXT></DOC>
