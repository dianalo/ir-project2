The United States is prepared to aid the effort, but ``theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies are the logicalorganizations to coordinate the job,'' State Department spokesmanCharles E. Redman said.   More than 5 million Afghans have fled to neighboring countries,mostly Pakistan, during the eight-year war that has pitted theAfghan government and Soviet troops against U.S.-backed guerrillaforces.   Now that Soviet forces are to leave the country by early nextyear, under an agreement to be signed in Geneva on Thursday, thereturn of the displaced Afghan population is emerging as one of thenext difficult regional issues to be settled.   Adding to the difficulty is the likelihood of continued fightingafter the departure of Soviet troops, because both superpowers havereserved the right to keep aiding the warring factions.   Redman, referring to further settlement talks led by UnitedNations mediator Diego Cordovez, said ``a constructive effort istaking place to work out an interim government and to help therefugees return in safety and honor.''   He said there was no timetable for the return of the refugeesand added:   ``This process has to be done in such a way that it's donesecurely, that these people are taken care of. There is obviouslygoing to be some social disorganization inside Afghanistan as thisproceeds. We need to try to do this in a coordinated way.''   Pakistan, though which much of the U.S. aid to the Afghanresistance has been funneled, is especially eager for the return ofthe refugees from border regions that have been made unstable bythe war.   State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,said they hoped for the earliest possible return of the refugeesbut were concerned about the impact further fighting in the countrywould have on resettlement.   They also said the withdrawal of Soviet forces from the countrycould touch off a massive desire among the refugees to trek home.   ``The likelihood of continued violence does not frighten theAfghan people,'' one official said. ``What made them flee in thefirst place was not violence, it was the magnitude of the violence,namely attacks from the Soviet air force, napalm attacks,helicopter raids on villages.''   ``When that ends they will want to return,'' the official said.   Under the Afghan accords, the Soviets will withdraw their troopsby Feb. 15, 1989, the refugees will return, and Afghanistan willbecome an independent, non-aligned nation.   The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed betweenthemselves, nevertheless, to continue aiding their clients in thecountry.   Redman said that agreement has been clarified in privatecommunications between Secretary of State George P. Shultz andSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and will bereinforced in statements by the two when they attend the signingceremony in Geneva.   Some U.S. conservatives, led by Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H.,have said they are concerned nonetheless that U.S. acceptance ofthe Afghan accord is a signal of flagging Reagan administrationsupport for the resistance forces.   A group of conservatives met the president Tuesday to expressthose concerns.   ``We think the administration is well intentioned, but wequestion the results,'' Paul Weyrich, president of the FreeCongress Foundation, told reporters after the meeting.   Weyrich said the conservatives told Reagan that Pakistan ``isgoing to have a very difficult time'' helping supply any new aid,because the accord calls for non-interference by Pakistan, as wellas the Soviet Union.   Reagan reminded the group that he had received personalassurances from Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq ``of theirwillingness to take the heat and the willingness to continuesupplying'' the resistance forces, Weyrich said.   ``The president told us repeatedly and in very definitive termsthat he is going to stand by the Afghan freedom fighters no matterwhat,'' Weyrich said.</TEXT></DOC>
