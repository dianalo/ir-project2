(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The telephone company in metropolitan NewYork is free to pull the plug on live dial-a-porn services aftertoday, a federal judge ruled in a free-speech case.   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn on Tuesday refused to block NewYork Telephone Co. from barring two-way conversations on its 970exchange.   The exchange, available only in four area codes around New YorkCity, allows callers to participate in sexually explicitconversations as well as hear taped messages.   Companies that operate such services set fees of $3 per minuteor more that New York Telephone is responsible for collecting. Thephone company was taken to court by dial-a-porn providers when itrefused to continue billing.   The services won a temporary order from a state court inSeptember that allowed the services to continue, and then broughtthe matter to federal court as a fight over freedom of speech.   McCurn ruled that the services had not proved the case was aFirst Amendment issue, but he also refused to throw out the case,leaving open the possibility the vendors can seek court relief onother grounds.   Two-way dial-a-porn services provided by five companies willcease at the end of the business day today, said their lawyer, JoelDichter. But he said he would file a motion as soon as possible toallow the services to resume.   New York Telephone attorney Kevin Walsh said the case was nevera fight over freedom of speech. He said the phone company has nopower to regulate the content of taped messages or liveconversations.   ``No one is prohibiting them from speaking. If people want tospend 50 minutes on the phone with Stella or 30 minutes withRaquel, they have the right and the companies have the right toprovide that service,'' said Walsh.   ``But we're not going to do the billing and collecting. Withthis kind of thing, it's easy to see people getting carried awayand then not wanting to pay the bill when it comes due.''</TEXT></DOC>
