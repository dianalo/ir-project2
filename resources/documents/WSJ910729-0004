In a study for the Labor Department, the John GrayInstitute, a unit of the Lamar University system in Beaumont,Texas, said the department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration should require the industry to assumeresponsibility for training and overseeing safety practicesof contract workers. The institute said this would lower therisk of injuries and deaths in refineries and chemicalsplants.</LP><TEXT>   The institute also urged that OSHA set safety trainingstandards for all petrochemical employees and require theindustry to create labor-management safety committees thatinclude contract-worker representatives at each site.   The study was commissioned by OSHA after the October 1989explosion and fire at a Phillips Petroleum Co. chemicalcomplex near Houston that killed 23 people and injured 232.OSHA has cited Phillips and Fish Engineering andamp; ConstructionInc., a contractor on the site, for numerous violations. OSHAand other industry critics have cited petrochemicalcompanies' increased reliance on contract workers as onepossible cause of such disasters.   The John Gray study reinforced a preliminary report thatsaid contract workers receive less safety training thanpermanent workers and are more loosely supervised. In thefinal study, the institute said the use of contract workershas been rising, with contract employees accounting for asmuch as 54% of the plants' work hours.</TEXT></DOC>
