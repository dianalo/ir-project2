It willobviously, given the size of the deployment, be something that willrun over a significant additional period of time. I wouldn't wantto be more precise than that. We've always refrained fromindicating when a particular unit would be deployed andcombat-ready.   Clear in the back?   Q: Does this deployment involve a further call-up of reserves,and has there been consultation with congressional leaders today onthis deployment?   SECRETARY CHENEY: The answer is it will involve an additionalcall-up of reserves, and there have been notifications to membersof Congress. I personally talked with the leadership and thechairmen and ranking members of all of the key Armed Services andAppropriations committees.   Q: As you increase your deployments, will you be able tomaintain the promise that I think was made by the joint - thechairman of the joint chiefs that you would rotate people in andout every six months?   SECRETARY CHENEY: We've never made such a promise. We've saidthat we were looking at a rotation policy, but the forces that weare ordering into the area today are not going in there to replacethose that have already been deployed. They are in addition tothose that are already in the area.   Frank?   Q: Mr. Secretary, is it safe to say that the message that isbeing sent from this room today is that the United State is nowprepared to fight a ground war to force Iraq out of Kuwait ifnecessary?   SECRETARY CHENEY: The message is - as exactly as we've statedit, and as the President stated it, and that is that our policy isto see to it that Saddam Hussein complies with the resolutionsvoted by the U.N. Security Council.   Those are our goals and objectives that - we are hopeful that wecan achieve that peacefully; we're hopeful we can achieve thatthrough the application of the economic sanctions now in force. Butwe also have the military option available to us should the othercourse of action be unsuccesful.   One more question and then I've got to run.   Q: If I may follow up, Mr. Secretary -   SECRETARY CHENEY: Yes.   Q: - you've been reluctant - wait just a - Mr. Secretary   -   STAFF: On whom did you call?   SECRETARY CHENEY: The young man with the hair on the - front -(extensive laughter) -   Q: Mr. Secretary, do you agree that the winter months are anoptimal time to fight a war in the desert? And is weathercompelling a decision to use force before the sanctions have had -   SECRETARY CHENEY: I wouldn't want to speculate about futuredeadlines of when sanctions will be deemed to have failed, or whatpressures weather and climate considerations might bring to bear.We are prepared to carry out the president's instructions, andthose instructions are as I've already related.   One more question. The gentleman I insulted in back, and thenI've got to go. Yes, sir.   Q: Mr. Secretary, you've been reluctant here to use a number.The number 100,000 additional troops has been widely used andwidely reported. Is that ballpark accurate?   SECRETARY CHENEY: I have never used the number 100,000. We'venever announced a number. Until we actually have those additionalforces in theater, we'll continue to pursue that policy. I wouldexpect they'll be all kinds of numbers rumored, leaked, speculatedabout.   But the fact is, none of them has any official standing. We haveopened up the pipeline to send forces to the Gulf and to SaudiArabia in support of Desert Shield, and we are today announcingthat there are additional forces going as part of that overalleffort.   Thank you very much.</TEXT><HEAD>END BUSH-FORCES TEXT - 8 Takes</HEAD><TEXT/></DOC>
