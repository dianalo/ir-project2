The methods have been used todetermine the concentrations of more than 20 elements in five medicinalplants native to Uzbekistan: Syrian rue (Peganum harmala L.), plantain(Plantago lanceolata), peppermint (Mentha piperata L.), sage (Salviaofficinalis L.), and ziziphora (Ziziphora bungeana Yur.). The resultsof radio-activation analysis were compared with the results of standardspectral analysis performed in another laboratory and the accuracy ofthe procedures developed was evaluated on the basis of the results.</TEXT></DOC>
