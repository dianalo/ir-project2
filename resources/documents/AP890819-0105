(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Helicopter pilot Tim Graves says he fearedprison guards would kill him when two inmates' wives commandeeredhis chopper and forced him to land at the Arkansas ValleyCorrectional Facility.   ``Imagine what it feels like to be flying, and all at once youhave two pistols on your head, and they tell you that you're goingto land at a prison ... your biggest fear is being shot by theprison guards,'' Graves told reporters Friday.   ``You don't know if they're going to let you get out of therealive. You figure once you land they're going to kill you,'' Gravessaid.   Authorities said Patricia Gonzales, 41, and Rebecca Brown, 26,ordered Graves to pluck their husbands from the prison yard. Thefour later transferred to a van and drove as far as Holdrege, Neb.,about 400 miles away, where they were captured after a shootout withauthorities.   Bob Pence, head of the Denver FBI office, said Graves is not asuspect in the escape attempt. Graves said he filled in on theflight for another pilot who canceled the night before.   The FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration interviewedGraves for three hours for any information he might have about whowas involved in the escape and where the foursome was headed, Pencesaid.   Pence said the women could be charged with air piracy, a federalcrime.   The women had reserved a 1969 Bell 206-A helicopter fromHelicopter Airways Inc. at Centennial Airport in suburban Denver,telling company officials they wanted to take photographs of realestate. The women were picket up at La Junta.   ``They pulled out the guns after we were in the air for 10minutes, and they said, `You're going to land in that prison,'''Graves said.   After plucking Ralph Brown, 30, and cellmate Freddie Gonzales,21, from the prison yard, Graves flew the helicopter out and landedabout 30 miles north of Ordway, near an abandoned farmhouse alongColorado Highway 71.   The escapees tied Graves up and put him face down in a shed, witha handkerchief protecting his face from the dirt, Lincoln CountySheriff LeRoy Yowell said.   It took Graves about half an hour to cut himself free with apocket knife, Yowell said. Searchers in another helicopter spottedhim waving the handkerchief at them.   Graves had been flying for Helicopter Airways for about threemonths after a five-year Army stint.   Vic Meisinger, president of Helicopter Airways, said a womanidentifying herself as Julie Quinn contacted him Aug. 10 aboutrenting the helicopter to take her and another woman to see realestate near La Junta. Meisinger said he scheduled to pick up thewomen on Wednesday, but he scrapped the flight because of badweather and rescheduled it for Friday morning.   Graves said he was awakened at 6 a.m. to fill in for anotherpilot who canceled the night before.</TEXT></DOC>
