<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0239 </DOCNO><TEXT>A process for the production of a fuel gas which includes the steps of:gasification of a liquid hydrocarbon or solid carbonaceous material inthe presence of air and optionally steam to produce a gas stream comprisinghydrogen, nitrogen and carbon oxides, removing solids therefrom fromthe gas stream, mixing the gas stream with steam and subjecting the resultingstream to carbon monoxide shift to convert at least a portion of thecarbon monoxide present to carbon dioxide with generation of hydrogen,removing at least a portion of the carbon dioxide and other acid gasfrom the gas stream; reacting the hydrogen in the gas stream with carbonoxides present in the gas stream or with solid carbonaceous materialto generate methane and subjecting the product gas stream to cryogenicseparation to yield at least a nitrogen-rich stream and methane containingfuel gas.</TEXT></DOC>
