Presented is the retrieval strategy, system approach, andprogram necessary to go from the conceptual design waste retrieval conceptthrough the following: advanced conceptual retrieval design and demonstration;license application retrieval design and testing; submittal of retrieval-basedlicense application design and input; and equipment testing, prototyperetrieval engineering, and associated retrieval option maintenance evaluationsfor all repository program phases. This work is a cooperative effortinvolving the input of a multidiscipline working group and building onthe efforts of previous repository program studies on waste retrieval.Included in this document are descriptions of the salt repository programoperational concepts on emplacement, postemplacement, and retrieval,as well as interpretations of retrieval-related institutional and designrequirements and criteria. Conditions expected during a waste retrievaloperation are discussed. Also, preliminary plans for future work, bothproof-of-principle demonstration and associated retrieval design activities,are presented, followed by an order-of-magnitude cost estimate and schedulefor the future work. 35 refs., 40 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
