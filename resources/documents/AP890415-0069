The governmentsaid at least 48 people were killed.   President Najib accused the U.S.- and Pakistan-backedguerrillas, who have been fighting the pro-Soviet government for adecade, of stepping up attacks since the Geneva Accords were signedin 1988.   Intense fighting broke out along the Salang Highway, a keysupply route running north to the Soviet border from Kabul.   Dozens of jet fighters and helicopter gunships were seen flyingtoward the surrounding mountains, and tanks and other militaryvehicles raced northward.   Government soldiers at a checkpoint about 10 miles north ofKabul said guerrillas hit an armored personnel carrier. They didnot know whether anyone was killed.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said fightingnear Kabul killed 43 guerrillas, three government soldiers and twocivilians. He said 19 civilians were injured.   Guerrillas have fired 12 rockets into the city of 2.25 millionpeople since Friday, Amani said.   Fierce fighting also was reported in the southern garrison townof Khost, he said, but there were no casualties.   His statements could not be independently verified.   The guerrillas had cut off the Salang Highway more than a weekago, but a convoy of about 100 trucks broke through the blockadeFriday and brought food and fuel to the capital.   Also Friday, government forces dislodged guerrilla forces whohad blocked another supply route leading to the eastern city ofJalalabad, which has been under guerrillas siege since March 6.   Najib, in a 45-minute speech to members of the Cabinet,Politburo, Central Committee, religious leaders and diplomats,accused Pakistan and the United States of violating the GenevaAccords and said one result could be ``regional conflict.''   The U.N.-mediated agrement was signed April 14, 1988 by Pakistanand Afghanistan, with the United States and the Soviet Union actingas guarantors. The accords cleared the way for the final pullout ofSoviet troops on Feb. 15 and called on Pakistan and Afghanistan tostay out of each other's internal affairs.   The guerrillas were not part of the negotiations and vowed tokeep fighting to overthrow Najib's government.   ``Today, precisely two months have elapsed since the completewithdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan. But the war,intervention and armed aggression are continuing with an intensityunprecedented during the past 10 years,'' said the 43-year-oldleader.   Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistan of armedinterference and violating the U.N.-mediated accords.   The U.N. Good Office Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan, set upto investigate the claims, has acknowledged violations but declinedto say by which country.   Najib said his government had pursued a ``humane and Islamicpolicy of national reconcilation,'' declaring unilateralcease-fires and presenting proposals for dividing and sharing statepower.   ``They stubbornly rejected any kind of political settlement,''he said.   During the past year, Najib said, guerrillas fired 432,730rockets, cannons and other weapons on Afghan cities, killing 2,222civilians and wounding 13,776.   He said 35,927 guerrillas had been killed and another 17,547guerrillas wounded. He gave no estimate of how many solders hadbeen killed or wounded.   He also said the fighting had destroyed more than $400 millionworth of property.   ``We could have avoided these losses. Our conscience is clean,''Najib said. ``The responsibilty ... should lie on the shoulders ofthose who are making use of the war as a means of living andensuring personal interests. Their hands are soaked in the blood ofinnocent people.''</TEXT></DOC>
