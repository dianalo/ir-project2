Low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing -- the engine thatdrove the &quot;miracle&quot; economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwanand South Korea in the past 25 years -- is relocating toSoutheast Asia.</LP><TEXT>   The massive migration is laying the groundwork for anindustrial surge in the less-developed nations, and isforcing the four newly industrialized countries to shifttheir focus to high-technology, value-added production.   &quot;The region as a whole is at a crossroads in theindustrialization process,&quot; says Nicholas Kwan, an economistat Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in Singapore.   The second wave of Asian industrialization poses manychallenges throughout the region.   In the developing nations of Southeast Asia, themanufacturing boom is exposing some severe weaknesses ininfrastructure. It also is throwing a spotlight oneducational deficiencies that limit the level of workers'skills. Moreover, some economists warn that the region isrelying too heavily on cheap labor for immediate gains.   In the newly industrialized countries, companies arestepping up expenditures on research and development andeagerly seeking technology transfers with Japan and the West.   The new phase in Asian industry follows a shift inregional investment and trade patterns in recent years.Because of rising production costs at home, many companiesfrom Japan and the industrialized countries have set uplow-wage factories in Southeast Asia. The flow of capitalinto the region has been enormous. For instance, in 1989,Japan received Bangkok's approval to invest $3.52 billion inThailand, according to a recent report by the AsianDevelopment Bank. From 1986 to 1988, Japanese approvals forThai investment totaled $1.52 billion.   The flood of investment has spurred a significant jump intrade within the region. In 1989, intra-regional exportssurpassed shipments to both North America and Europe, thetraditional markets for Asian products. Intra-Asian shipmentstotaled $270 billion in 1989, compared with $206 billion forNorth America and $182 billion for Europe, according to thedevelopment bank.   But as Southeast Asia absorbs the flood of investment andjoins in the new trade flows, its underdevelopedinfrastructure is beginning to creak. Massive bottlenecks arethreatening to undercut industrial development.   In Thailand, for instance, the Bangkok transportationsystem is so poor that vehicles travel at an average speed ofbetween three and five miles per hour, according to CrosbySecurities (HK) Ltd. In addition, the country is plagued by ahost of troubles with ports, telecommunications and energygeneration.   Despite the obvious urgency, the government is failing totackle the problem, preferring to leave solutions mostly inthe hands of the private sector. Some analysts warn of direconsequences. &quot;All too often the government is not paving theway to help industry develop,&quot; says Paul Ensor, a director ofBaring Research Ltd.'s representative office in Thailand.   But other analysts see Bangkok's hands-off policy as oneof Thailand's comparative strengths. Ian P. MacFarlane, chiefeconomist at Wardley Investment Services (Hong Kong) Ltd.,points out that Thailand's economic growth has outpaced everycountry in Asia for the past three years. &quot;If the economy isdeveloping in a slightly untidy way, the statistics andeconomic theory would argue that Thailand will be moresuccessful than other countries in the region preciselybecause of that,&quot; he adds.   Infrastructure snags may also affect Indonesia'sindustrial prospects. Crosby Securities says that inefficientenergy generation is slowing expansion of productioncapacity. While demand for electricity is growing at anaverage rate of 17% a year, the state power authority isexpected to muster only a 9% boost in capacity this year.Some new factories face power rationing. With the ports,airport, roads and telecommunications also in poor condition,Crosby Securities is predicting an infrastructure crunch bynext year.   However, some analysts believe that despite Indonesia'swoes, the country is unlikely to face bottlenecks on the samescale as Thailand. &quot;Indonesia will address the problems moredirectly and immediately than Thailand,&quot; says EugeneGalbraith, director of Hoare Govett (Asia) Ltd.'s Jakartaoffice.   The countries of Southeast Asia are also grappling withthe demand for qualified workers to staff new manufacturingfacilities. Analysts say that education is playing a pivotalrole in the current phase of industrialization.   In its recent report, the Asian Development Bank says thatthe Philippines has squandered its lead in education amongSoutheast Asian nations. Its advantage has &quot;steadily erodedas a result of relatively low rates of investment ineducation, faster population growth and higher incidence ofbrain drain,&quot; the bank's report says. Moreover, thePhilippines has lagged in training workers for emergingindustrial tasks.   The skilled-labor pool also is facing constraints inMalaysia, where the electronics industry is gobbling upincreasing numbers of workers. For instance, more than 44% ofapproved investments from Japan in 1990 were inlabor-intensive electronics manufacturing. Progress inbeefing up the ranks of skilled workers is expected soon.   Whatever the current limitations, foreign manufacturerscontinue to set up operations in Southeast Asia and employlarge numbers of local workers. Sony Corp., for instance, hasestablished seven factories in Malaysia and Thailand since1988, with a total employment roll of 6,680.   In the long term, analysts say that Southeast Asia has toclimb higher on the technological ladder to ensure futuregrowth. Most economists believe that such evolution is thenatural next step in the industrial process. &quot;The economiesof Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are going to follow thesorts of development patterns which you've already seentaking place in Korea and Taiwan,&quot; says Wardley's Mr.MacFarlane. &quot;They will be producing the kinds of things whichKorea and Taiwan are today.&quot;   Other economists stress that mimicry of the industrializedcountries' strategies may not produce the most appropriateindustries for Southeast Asia. Because most countries in theregion are rich in resources, they would likely benefit fromthe development of industries based on those naturaladvantages, the economists say.   The suggestion isn't lost on planners in Indonesia, whereindustries based on the country's vast forestry and oilresources are showing the swiftest growth in exports andinvestment. &quot;People need to think in terms of fundamentaldifferences between countries,&quot; says Sanjoy Chowdhury, chiefeconomist, Asian-Pacific region, at Merrill Lynch inSingapore. &quot;Korea and Taiwan don't have natural resources, sotheir development should follow different paths fromSoutheast Asian nations.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
