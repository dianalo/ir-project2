Cartusciello said at an hourlong hearing Friday in federal court. &quot;The defendants or somebody close to them . . . are a likely source&quot; of the leaks, the prosecutor said.    Mr. Cartusciello added that the defense attorneys' motion for an order barring allegedly improper statements in the future -- and for a probe of whether the government leaked secret grand jury data to the Journal -- was &quot;remarkable, it's unprecedented and quite honestly it's outrageous.&quot;    The trading case involves three top Wall Street figures who were indicted in April but don't currently face criminal charges: Robert M. Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs and Co.; and Richard B. Wigton and Timothy L. Tabor, both former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. arbitragers. The government sought and received dismissal of the indictment but has said an investigation looking toward a wider indictment is continuing. The motion heard Friday was brought a week earlier by attorneys for Messrs. Freeman and Tabor.    Paul J. Curran, attorney for Mr. Freeman, argued at the hearing that a May 22 Journal article was &quot;just chock-full of matters occurring before the grand jury,&quot; including the names of 11 takeover-related stocks that figure in the government's investigation and other data. The article appeared a week after the government dropped insider-trading charges against the three men.    U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram reserved decision on the attorneys' call for an investigation into the sources of the May 22 article, as well as the proposed order against U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and his assistants.    With respect to a separate article published in the Journal May 14, Mr. Cartusciello said that a sealed affidavit that his office filed with the judge Friday &quot;makes it very clear&quot; that his boss, Mr. Giuliani, &quot;wouldn't have said&quot; certain comments that were paraphrased and attributed to him, because to do so would have disclosed grand jury information.    The paraphrase in the May 14 article read, in part, that Mr. Giuliani &quot;said the government has recently granted immunity from prosecution to potential witnesses who had previously invoked the Fifth Amendment. . . . The witnesses are now providing testimony and records that could lead to more charges against the three men and to the naming of additional defendants, Mr. Giuliani said.&quot;    The government, in court papers filed Friday, said the &quot;inaccuracy of the article's paraphrase of (Mr. Giuliani's) comments&quot; is explained in the affidavit by Mr. Cartusciello filed privately with Judge Kram.    Paul E. Steiger, a deputy managing editor of the Journal, said the paper stands by the article.    The dispute over the allegedly improper statements also centers on information filed by prosecutors in court, and discussed at news conferences, about the scope of the investigation. Mr. Cartusciello argued that such government disclosures about the grand jury were proper because, in part, no names of witnesses and potential defendants were revealed. But Mr. Curran contended that, with that logic, Mr. Giuliani could hold &quot;daily news conferences&quot; and tell everything about the progress of a grand jury probe, as long as he didn't name names.    In her only indication about how she viewed the dispute, Judge Kram said she was &quot;interested&quot; to know why the defense lawyers hadn't protested in open court earlier in the case, when some of the allegedly improper statements about the scope of the grand jury probe were made by prosecutors. </TEXT></DOC>
