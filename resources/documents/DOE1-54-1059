On the basis of a separable approximationfor the propagator in the transfer channel, we obtain simple expressionsfor the elastic S matrix which include effects of the coupling to allorders. These expressions are used to study the elastic scattering of/sup 16/O+/sup 28/Si at 180{sup 0}. It is shown that a standard two-stepdistorted-wave Born approximation treatment of the coupling is unableto explain the order of magnitude of the data. On the other hand, theinclusion of high-order processes leads to a qualitative agreement withthe data. This modification in the results was traced down to the appearanceof a pole in the elastic S matrix near the real axis. The S matrix calculatedhere was shown to be consistent with others obtained phenomenologicallyfrom fits to the available data. We suggest that the apparent importanceof {alpha}-transfer effects in elastic scattering implies that such processesshould be relevant in other nuclear reactions involving n{alpha} nuclei.</TEXT></DOC>
