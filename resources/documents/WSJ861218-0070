Borden, a food and chemical company, acquired 31 facilities and all the dairy division's brand names, including Meadow Gold milk products, Viva low-fat dairy products, Louis Sherry ice cream, Mountain High yogurt, and Hotel Bar and Keller's butter.    BCI, a Chicago-based food and consumer products concern, acquired Beatrice Cos. in a leveraged buyout earlier this year. In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
