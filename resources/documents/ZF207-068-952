(aims and objectives).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Not long ago, I stopped by Lotus Development Corp. to pay a visit to JimManzi.andP;  ''Tell me, Jim,'' I asked, ''how did you get such a bum rap?''andM;''It started,'' he replied, ''when someone, whom I had never met, wrote thatI was arrogant and ruthless .andP;  .  .  when in reality, people who know methink I'm a nice guy.'' He then leaned forward, and said with a trace of asmile, ''Actually, deep down inside, I'm a real *$%.''andM;Jim Manzi is an obsessed man -- obsessed with productivity, withunderstanding how people use information.andP;  And he's obsessed with creatingtools for the masses.andP;  In an industry that invariably focuses on technologyfor technology's sake, notice of Manzi's vision of Lotus as a productivitytools and information company has all too often become lost.andM;That Manzi is misunderstood perplexes me.andP;  On another visit to his office, Ihad company -- Manzi was being photographed by Fortune magazine for anarticle on America's 10 toughest bosses.andM;He is quick-witted, and perhaps some people construe that as arrogance.andP;  Yethe's full of fabulous truisms such as, ''The winner in the user interface warwill be the product with the highest quality and the best value.'' Onspreadsheets and the specter of saturation: ''1-2-3 is not simply acollection of features and functions; rather, one man's end product isanother's building block for an entire system.'' On his own guidingprinciples: ''There are two things that I hate: self-promotion and stealingothers' ideas.''andM;Manzi's opinions on marketing and distribution channels are unambiguous.andP;  ''Abig argument I had with [Lotus founder] Mitch Kapor was that he wanted totake 1-2-3 off of the market once Symphony was announced.andP;  .  .  .  I'm happyto say that I won that argument.''andM;What does Manzi think of Egghead President Victor Alhadeff's assertion thatthe distribution channel will dictate to the developers? ''I stayed atVictor's house the other night and he made that assertion.andP;  I told him togrow up.''andM;In turf battles, Manzi is often compared to Microsoft's Bill Gates.andP;  Butbecause Manzi isn't a programming visionary but a productivity visionary, hiscontribution is less well understood in the technical community, whichcommands a large share of public perception.andP;  Yet Lotus can envision anddeliver better productivity tools than competitors with deeper programmingroots.andP;  The key enabler here is the company's direct sales force, whoseoutreach and established customer relationships give Lotus insight as to howcustomers actually create and use information.andM;Magellan and Agenda are examples of such productivity tools.andP;  While devoid ofglitzy pull-down menus or graphics, these products address the need forindividuals to harness the fire hose of information that PCs have generated.andM;In fact, I'm not sure whether a product's merit should be measured by whetherdialogue boxes pop down or whether such an interface is pleasing to aprogrammer.andP;  The fact is, a menu system based on a command line andkeystrokes may be more suitable to end users than systems that exudeprogramming elegance.andM;This year clearly will be a paradoxical one for Lotus.andP;  It will be rich inproduct rollout (release 3 of 1-2-3, Notes groupware, Magellan), and it willbe a year rich in competitive challenge (Microsoft has apparently hired 80salespeople just to hawk a repeatedly price-slashed Excel.)andM;While the legendary Lotus sales force and add-ins will stunt spreadsheetdefections, Lotus will need to execute almost flawlessly to stem further lossof market share.andP;  The fact is, the company has belatedly put in place thedevelopment disciplines to ensure on-time product rollouts.andP;  The company mayalso be accused of missing an opportunity to harness its 4 millionlook-and-feels as a general-purpose character environment.andM;From an investment perspective, Lotus can experience substantial change insentiment as its earnings in the second half of 1989 could double those oflast year.andP;  Meanwhile, the company is buying its own shares, keeping thestock price from falling below the high teens.andM;----------The Market Maker column is shared by Ruthann Quindlen and Jonathan Fram.andO;Fram is president of Institutional Research Network Inc. in New York.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
