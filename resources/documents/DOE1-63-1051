Remote meter readingis one feature currently receiving much attention. The automation ofany single feature requires hardware to automate the feature, a communicationlink, hardware to receive the data, and a power source. The incrementedcost of automating a second feature can be made quite small if the secondfeature uses the same power source, communication link, and electronichardware. This paper presents a total system approach to automating gasdistribution. The key concepts of any such approach are: 1) automatingmany features together, 2) establishing a set of industry-wide stablestandards, 3) making components modular and interchangeable, and 4) theuse of distributed intelligences. The paper gives an example of a totallyautomated system as a basis for discussing the benefits of the totalapproach. It also describes the difficulties of estimating the valueof automating a feature, describes retrofitting problems that must besolved, and provides strong arguments for the development of stable standardsin communication protocol, power supply, and interconnection of hardware.</TEXT></DOC>
