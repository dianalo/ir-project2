WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of a House panel investigatingallegations of wrongdoing at HUD during the Reagan administrationsays its inquiry is likely to end soon, but that the subcommitteehas shown there was a ``colossal scandal'' at the agency.   ``I have high hopes the Justice Department will do its duty,''subcommittee chairman Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Friday afterformer HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. again refused to testify.   Lantos excused Pierce from a subpoena requiring anotherappearance next week and said the panel, faced with a refusal totestify from three other former top HUD officials, would soon endits inquiry.   The subcommittee, Lantos said, had ``demonstrated a colossalscandal'' existed at the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment during the Reaga administration. The panel isinvestigating allegations of fraud, influence-peddling andmismanagement.   Lantos said the subcommittee doesn't plan to offer immunity fromprosecution to Pierce or his former aides as a way of compellingthem to testify, though that remains an option.   Pierce invoked his Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination for a second time Friday, and some lawmakerscalled for a special prosecutor.   ``Now it's clear that Sam Pierce is stonewalling,'' said Rep.Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Our only choice now is to take theprocess from the legislative arena and move it into the arena of anindependent counsel.''   Pierce said he wants to tell his story but refused to answer anyquestions, saying he had been made a target of the subcommittee'sinvestigation and ``unfairly accused of alleged lies anddishonesty.''   ``I look forward to the time when innuendoes and rumors to thecontrary are put to rest,'' he said. ``I look forward to the timewhen I can tell my story, and I can assure you I do have a story totell.''   Pierce testified voluntarily before the panel in May. But herefused to testify last month when the panel subpoenaed him toanswer questions about what members say are inconsistencies andcontradictions between his and other witnesses' testimony.   Lantos put a series of questions to Pierce, including one abouta former HUD official's contradiction of the former secretary'stestimony that he did not influence the selection of HUD subsidyawards.   Pierce called the question ``unfair'' and refused to answer.   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said Pierce's earlier testimonyon that point ``could be perjury'' and told Pierce it was ``in yourbest interest'' to answer.   After Pierce's latest refusal, Schumer and Rep. Bruce Morrison,D-Conn., both members of the House Judiciary Committee, said theywould seek a vote to formally ask the Justice Department to name aspecial prosecutor to investigate Pierce.   Only a majority of the members of either party on the JudiciaryCommittee is required to initiate a formal process requiring areview of the request and response by Attorney General DickThornburgh, Schumer said.   ``I think it's clear from these hearings ... that there iscriminal activity at HUD in the area of defrauding of the federalgovernment, conspiracy to defraud the government, and we may wellhave perjury,'' said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.   Lantos, meanwhile, disclosed that Pierce had asked HUD to payhis legal expenses stemming from the congressional probe. HUDSecretary Jack Kemp rejected the request, Lantos said.</TEXT></DOC>
