<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0544 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new method for plausibility checks and bad data processing, based ona network search technique and linear programming is proposed. Data validationis performed by sequential search through the network graph, during whichbad marks are given to suspect measurements. Areas of the network withbad marks are further analysed using linear programming. The procedureis efficient in detecting interacting, and noninteracting bad data, andinconsistent switch states. It also provides a set of voltages and angles.Static state estimation, if necessary, may then be performed on a reliableset of data, starting from the computer set of voltages and angles, toobtain a best fit of the measurements. The computing requirements ofthe method depend on the number and nature of abnormalities in the network.However, the overall cpu time requirement for validating data and datafitting is modest.</TEXT></DOC>
