It will be a modest affair to start with, he reckons,numbering 50,000 men committed to &quot;defending the sovereignUkrainian state.&quot; But it could easily grow to a force of200,000, including part of the Black Sea fleet. As forweapons, &quot;our people will just take what they need,&quot; says the51-year-old officer. &quot;It's our right.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Col. Martirosyan used to be viewed by the Soviet militaryestablishment as a dangerous subversive. After last month'sfailed coup, he has become a trendsetter. Almost everyrepublic of what is now officially called &quot;the formerU.S.S.R.&quot; is clamoring to establish its own military or totake control of the Soviet troops on its territory.   From Presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin down,the nation's politicians are urging big changes in thestructure and funding of the Red Army to bring it in linewith new political -- and longstanding economic -- realities.   The generation of officers that has taken over the armedforces following the coup faces an extraordinarily complexchallenge: to cut back and decentralize the military, butstill retain its unity.   &quot;This is the moment of truth in the revival of theprestige of the armed forces,&quot; said Marshal YevgenyShaposhnikov, the newly appointed defense minister, lastweek. &quot;We must not lose our bearings in this maelstrom.&quot;   The future of the Soviet military machine, widelyestimated to account for a quarter of the nation's grossnational product, is of vital importance to the West. TheRussian republic, for one, has already said it wants toreduce total military outlays by a third, and some Sovietanalysts say the size of the Red Army could be halved toabout two million servicemen.   If this restructuring is carried out in a calm and orderlyway, the armed forces will likely emerge far leaner, but moreprofessional and more predictable than today's lumbering anddemoralized giant. Yet there is a risk of chaos if themilitary can't adapt to the rapid political changes that aretaking place, particularly the contradictory demands of manyrepublics.   &quot;The basic question remains,&quot; says Andrei Kortunov, anarms-control specialist at Moscow's U.S.A. and CanadaInstitute. &quot;Will there be a union army with a center that canstill control it, or will there be a complete disintegrationof the armed forces as the country disintegrates?&quot;   The answer lies, in part, with people like Col.Martirosyan, the Ukrainian officer. His group is just one,and by no means the most extreme, of those now helping toformulate military policy in Soviet republics. Russia, theUkraine, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan have already set up theirown defense ministries, and others are planning to followsuit.   Col. Martirosyan says most Ukrainians support the creationof a Ukrainian force. Just how powerful it will become, andhow it interacts with Soviet troops, will depend on who is incharge in Moscow. &quot;We don't trust the military leadership,&quot;he says. &quot;If we did, we could limit ourselves to just arepublican guard. At the moment, that isn't possible.&quot;   The Kremlin wants to head off disintegration. It concedesthe principle of republics establishing their own forces. Atthe same time, it is trying to cool the hotheads and underpinthe need for military unity.   Some Soviet analysts talk about emulating the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization, in which the armed forces ofindividual states coordinate their activities. But MarshalShaposhnikov and the new chief of general staff, Gen.Vladimir Lobov, are floating proposals that would allowrepublics to operate their own &quot;small&quot; military formations,of perhaps 2,000 to 3,000 men. Loosely modeled on the U.S.National Guard, these would double as civil defense teams andas national reserves in case of war. Republics also would beexpected to provide men and finances to support the nationalarmed forces.   Most republics may not go along with such plans. TheBaltic states and Moldavia formally requested the quickwithdrawal of all Soviet troops from their territory.Kazakhstan and the Ukraine are heatedly debating whether toallow the forces stationed locally -- including the nuclearones -- to be controlled by anyone other than their ownleaders. Meanwhile, to calm Western fears, civilian andmilitary leaders emphasize that Soviet nuclear forces willremain under central control.   The president of Armenia, Levon Ter-Petrossian, has yetanother proposal: The Soviet army should be turned into theRussian republic's army. He says it would be allowed tostation small contingents of troops in other republics -- butpay for the privilege. &quot;They would have the status ofmilitary bases,&quot; Mr. Ter-Petrossian says in an interview.&quot;The Soviet army was always the Russian army anyway.&quot;   In the Soviet empire, which worried about internal threatsas much as it feared external enemies, the military wasdeliberately structured to ensure Russian dominance and keepother ethnic groups in check. Conscripts never served intheir own republics, and the top brass was almost entirelyRussian. An elaborate system of control was established, withtens of thousands of political officers, all loyal CommunistParty members, overseeing day-to-day operations. They, inturn, were watched by KGB informers.   That structure received a mortal blow after last month'sfailed coup, which was supported by top brass and politicalofficers but openly opposed by middle ranks. Politicalofficers are now starting to lose their jobs, and many topbrass are waiting to be purged.   &quot;We are ready for it,&quot; said Gen. Mikhail Sorokin, 69 yearsold, a career army man who seems resigned to his forcedretirement. &quot;The situation was developing anyway,&quot; he adds.&quot;A reform of the armed forces has been ripe for a long time.&quot;   The men propelled to the top of the military differ fromtheir predecessors, and not just because they opposed thecoup. They are professionals, not politicians. Most are intheir early 50s, the first generation that didn't fight inWorld War II.   Pyotr Deynekin is typical of the new breed. A pilot withthe rank of colonel general, he was made a deputy defenseminister and commander-in-chief of the air force followingthe coup. He and his boss, Defense Minister Shaposhnikov,share many views.   &quot;The monster we had before cannot continue,&quot; Col. Gen.Deynekin says in an interview at the Kubinka air base outsideMoscow. He is a firm advocate of reform: The armed forcesshould move toward becoming a professional body, he says,although this may take time. And procurement policy should beradically changed, with the emphasis moving away from thethousands of tanks and artillery pieces that continue to rolloff the assembly lines, and toward high-technology weaponry.   He pauses for a moment as a MiG-29 fighter, one of theSoviet Union's most modern planes, roars past in a deafeningtraining flight. &quot;We reject old planes,&quot; Col. Gen. Deynekinsays, as the fighter disappears over the horizon. &quot;We want tofully re-equip using only modern aviation technology.&quot;   The air force played an important role in bringing thecoup to an end, which explains its sudden prominence in anation where the ground forces were long dominant. Mr.Yeltsin's vice president, Alexander Rutskoi, is himself anair force colonel who enjoys an extremely high reputationamong his former colleagues. When he was expelled from theCommunist Party this summer, the top four officers in the airforce, including Marshal Shaposhnikov and Col. Gen. Deynekin,quit the party in protest. During the coup, Mr. Rutskoi wasin constant contact with his former colleagues. By the secondday, they had ruled out participation in any military action.   Revamping the armed forces is clearly a mammoth task. ButSoviet and Western analysts believe the new militaryleadership is up to the task. Gen. Lobov, the chief ofgeneral staff, for example, has broad experience inoverhauling military organizations: He presided over thedissolution of the Warsaw Pact.   So far, though, the new top brass have formulated few oftheir ideas. The only official document circulating is athree-page outline drafted by the defense ministry. Accordingto people who have seen it, the outline mentions the need topreserve a central command system at the same time as givingrepublics a much greater say in military policy.   Marshal Shaposhnikov and representatives from all 15republics, including the three Baltic states, held initialtalks in Moscow this week on ways to ensure collectivesecurity. The representatives agreed in general to honorinternational obligations and ensure that nuclear weapons arekept in a single, centralized command. Soviet media reportssuggested that the meeting was mainly devoted to apreliminary discussion of some of the pressing militaryissues.   The establishment of republican forces worries the topbrass, but they are playing down their fears in public. &quot;I amfor diversity,&quot; says Col. Gen. Deneykin. &quot;In the U.S.S.R.,there will be more than 10 presidents, so why not have anappropriate number of defense ministers?&quot; Nonetheless, hecautions, &quot;the centrifugal forces must not win.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
