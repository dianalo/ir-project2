Meanwhile, the 57,800 striking Machinists faced the expirationof their health care benefits at midnight Tuesday, although theycould choose to continue the benefits by paying monthly premiums of$128 to $354 themselves.   Neither Boeing nor the Machinists union would comment on thesubstance of the talks that began Monday, although Tom Baker,president of Machinists District Lodge 751, said negotiators wereable to talk in great detail about the issues.   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond, who convened the talks, alsowould not discuss what was said but described the negotiations as``cordial and professional.''   ``These folks have a problem they're trying to solve and theyrecognize it,'' he said.   Hammond has said he wants to hold negotiations daily until asettlement is reached.   Machinists spokesman Jack Daniels said the union has acounterproposal to the Boeing offer which its membershipoverwhelmingly rejected Oct. 3, but he did not know whether it hadbeen presented.   Daniels said the mood among pickets at Boeing plants ``is alittle cheerier'' now that talks have resumed.   The strike began Oct. 4 after the union turned down a 3-yearoffer that included pay raises of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to virtually coverinflation; a reduction in mandatory overtime from 200 hours to 160hours per quarter; and higher benefits.   Strikers include 43,300 Machinists in the Seattle area; 12,000in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in Portland, Ore.; and a few hundred othersat scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Montana, Utah and otherstates. Boeing has a total 164,000 workers worldwide and 106,000 inWashington state.   Machinists received their last paychecks Oct. 19 and the firstof their $100-a-week strike payments last Thursday. However, theircompany-paid health plans remained in force through the end ofOctober.   Boeing offers a variety of medical plans, but Daniels said thecost of a medical plan for a single person would be $128.86 amonth, and for a family, $354.46. Striking workers have 60 daysafter the health coverage ends to decide whether to continue thecoverage on their own.   On Wednesday, Boeing begins ``maintable'' bargaining with itssecond-largest union, the Seattle Professional EngineeringEmployees Association, which represents about 30,000 engineers andtechnical workers. Subcommittees of SPEEA and Boeing negotiatorshave been meeting for the past week on various aspects of thecontract.   Like the Machinists, SPEEA wants a substantial pay raise. SPEEAofficials say they believe they can work out an offer to present totheir members by mid-November, well in advance of the Dec. 1contract expiration date.</TEXT></DOC>
