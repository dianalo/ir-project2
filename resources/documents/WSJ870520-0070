Edelman in the activities of indicted tax shelter promoter Charles Atkins, according to court documents.    Mr. Edelman, a well-known corporate raider, is one of 29 individuals whose names appear on a &quot;tentative list of persons who may be alleged to be co-conspirators and/or agents&quot; in the Atkins case, according to a document prepared by federal prosecutors. The list is part of public court filings in the Atkins case.    Stuart E. Abrams, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Atkins case, said, &quot;We haven't broken down the list into who might be viewed as a culpable co-conspirator, rather than being an innocent agent. It would be wrong to conclude from that list that all the people on it either committed crimes or might be charged with crimes.&quot;    Court documents indicate that the government is looking at securities trades between two investment units controlled by Mr. Edelman, Arbitrage Securities Co. and Plaza Securities Co., and Mr. Atkins's main operating unit, Securities Groups. The government has alleged that between 1978 and 1983 Mr. Atkins's tax-shelter operation generated more than $1.3 billion of fictitious losses through pre-arranged, riskless trades in government securities. Those fictitious losses then were used by Atkins clients and others for unwarranted tax deductions, the government has alleged.    Mr. Edelman, in a prepared statement, said, &quot;My attorney has confirmed with the U.S. attorney that I am not the target of any investigation.&quot; Mr. Abrams declined to comment on Mr. Edelman's statement that he isn't a target in the case.    Mr. Edelman claimed that his name was being &quot;publicly raised&quot; in the Atkins case by lawyers for Burlington Industries Inc., which is fighting a hostile takeover offer by Mr. Edelman and Montreal-based Dominion Textile Inc. Mr. Edelman said he is a victim of &quot;character assassination.&quot;    A Burlington Industries spokesman said that the documents in question are &quot;public documents which were prepared by the U.S. attorney,&quot; and that &quot;the facts which underlie Mr. Edelman's involvement, if any&quot; are between him and the U.S. attorney.    Last March, Mr. Atkins and two other men were indicted by a federal grand jury in an alleged tax fraud scheme described by the government as one of the largest ever. According to the indictment, the scheme enabled many prominent Wall Street figures, entertainers and other investors to deduct unwarrantedly a total of more than $350 million on their tax returns. None of the investors was charged with any wrongdoing.    Mr. Edelman is by far the most prominent person on the government's list of possible co-conspirators or agents. Among others listed are a number of former Securities Groups employees, including four former general partners in Securities Groups who pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy and tax-evasion charges.    Also on the list is John Toffolon, chief financial officer of First Boston Corp., a major securities firm. In other court documents, the government says First Boston was among 13 securities firms that allegedly provided &quot;fictitious losses&quot; to Securities Groups. A First Boston spokesman said yesterday that Mr. Toffolon &quot;just signed the paper work&quot; for any trades with Securities Groups, and he added that First Boston acted &quot;just as agent&quot; and wasn't involved in any tax-shelter activities.    The spokesman said that First Boston has &quot;been advised by the U.S. attorney's office that neither First Boston nor Mr. Toffolon is a target for prosecution.&quot;    Lawyers familiar with the Atkins case suggested that one reason the government may have drawn up the co-conspirators/agents list was to strengthen its case in court. By including an individual on the list, prosecutors may win the right to admit in evidence statements by that person which might otherwise be excluded by a court, the lawyers said. Thus, an individual might appear on the list without implying he is a potential government target, they said.    Central to the government's case against Atkins is the idea that the securities trades executed by Securities Groups were riskless, and therefore any losses from them couldn't be claimed for tax purposes.    Mr. Edelman said he is managing partner of both Arbitrage and Plaza. In court documents, the government says that Arbitrage was one of the 13 firms, including First Boston, that allegedly provided fictitious losses to Securities Groups through government securities trades.    Both Arbitrage and Plaza are also named by the government on another, shorter list of six &quot;entities purchasing fictitious losses&quot; from Securities Groups. This is a reference to government allegations that Securities Groups sold more than $200 million in false trading losses to other firms and individuals to be used as tax deductions.    James A. Moss, Mr. Atkins's lawyer, said, &quot;It remains for the government to elaborate on its theory of how the alleged co-conspirators warrant that status.&quot; He said that Mr. Atkins has made a court motion to dismiss the indictment on grounds that the government's theory of tax fraud isn't supported by the U.S. tax code. </TEXT></DOC>
