The second phase of the project dealt with additional agronomicstudies relating to the growth and production of milkweed as a cultivatedcroup, the potential end uses for the solvent extracted biomass and furtherevaluation of the extracted plant oil as a refinery feedstock. As theresults of the first phase showed the solvent extracted biomass to haveexcellent potential as a ruminant animal feed, a feeding trial was conductedto determine the biological data necessary to assign an economic valueto this material. The trials demonstrated the presence of a toxic substancein the extracted biomass. The solvent extracted biomass is being evaluatedas a fermentation feedstock after enzymatic hydrolysis. A scaled-up hydrolysishas been completed and the hydrolysate is undergoing conventional yeastfermentation to determine the quantity of ethanol which can be produced.3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
