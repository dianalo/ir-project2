<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-33-1077 </DOCNO><TEXT>The overall objective of this subcontract is to further establish andapply the technique of gel electrophoresis to characterize genetic variationbetween strains of microalgal species and to identify species most suitablefor improvement through genetic manipulation. Specific objectives are(1) to continue the examination of genetic variability within Amphoraand Nannochloropsis and to correlate this genetic variability with differencesin photosynthetic performance and (2) to begin similar examinations ofadditional species which have proven to be of interest for program applications.There are three approaches taken to achieve the objectives. (1) At least100 strains from each group will be surveyed for differences in electrophoreticbanding patterns. Each strain will be grown under both nutrient-sufficientand nutrient-deficient conditions, and banding patterns will be determinedfor both conditions. (2) The relationship between photosynthetic rateand incident irradiance will be determined for at least 20 strains ofeach of the two groups. (3) At least two additional species will be selectedby SERI and photosynthesis-irradiance relationships will be determinedfor a total number of not less than 20 strains selected from these species.</TEXT></DOC>
