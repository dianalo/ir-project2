As President Bush tended to matter of state at the 15th annualeconomic summit, the first lady set off on her own.   Mrs. Bush toured several rooms of the 17th chateau owned by theMarquis and Marquise Jean-Louis de Ganay.   ``Look at this, isn't it beautiful?'' marvelled Mrs. Bush as sheemerged in the blazing sunshine to tour the vast gardens with theirspring-fed ponds, laid out in the 17th century by the landscapistLenotre, who designed the Versailles gardens for Louis XIV.   ``I want you to get used to me here,'' Mrs. Bush joked with herhost and hostess, the Marquis and Marquise Jean-Louis de Ganay.   Joining Mrs. Bush on the tour were Susan Baker and Kitty Brady,wives of the secretaries of state and treasury.   ``Mrs. Bush wanted to see a chateau and pretty garden,'' saidSondra Daley, a spokesman for the first lady.   The choice was made by Ambassador Walter Curley and his wife, whoknow the de Ganay family.   Like many aristocratic owners, the de Ganays allow visitors topay admission to tour the chateau at certain times to defraymaintenance costs.   Strolling around the gardens, Mrs. Bush called to two dogs topose with her for a picture. ``Come on you two dogs, they want us inthe center,'' she said.   Referring to her own pet, she added, ``I hope Millie will takenote and not be jealous. She'll eat her heart out.''   Earlier Saturday, Mrs. Bush toured the ``Craft USA Today'' showat the Decorative Arts branch of the Louvre museum, where the workof 183 American artisans, ranging from patchwork quilts to a ceramicbriefcase, is displayed.   ``It makes you proud to be an American,'' she said.   She looked at her watch to see if a wooden clock called ``Time toSay Goodbye'' by Wendell Castle was keeping time. A museum spokesmansaid it had not been wound.   ``I love that,'' she said of an enormous tulipwood spheroid byEdward Moulthrop.   ``That's amazing,'' she said of a multicolored glass creation byDale Chihuly. ``One man blowing that. It's beautiful.''   When someone asked if she would like it for her Maine vacationhouse, she said, ``No, it's too grand for Kennebunkport.''   Mrs. Bush posed holding hands with a glazed clay 10-foot-highstatue of a man splashed with garish colors by Viola Frey.   ``It's just like in Washington, when you get your picture takenwith the president _ or the first lady,'' referring to the cardboardphoto setups popular with tourists outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</TEXT></DOC>
