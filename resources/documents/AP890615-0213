The Warner Bros. version of the 50-year-old comic book has provedthe most talked-about movie of the summer season, though not all ofthe talk has been good. The studio hopes that its publicity blastand the film itself will steamroller the negative stuff.   Controversy began with the casting of Michael Keaton as BruceWayne, a.k.a. Batman. Longtime Batfans were expecting more of a hunkto play their hero, not a slim comedy actor.   ``I had heard something (about the protests) while I was makingthe picture in England, but it didn't seem like any big deal tome,'' says Keaton. ``I am shocked-slash-fascinated. I'm telling you,man, these people must have the same lobbyists as the NRA (NationalRifle Association). These guys have some clout; I can't believe it.I mean, how many are there?   ``It's just funny to me. I never had time to get angry about itbecause we were working in England, and I missed a lot of it until Icame back.''   Director Tim Burton adds: ``Comic book people are very specific;they have a very strong image in their minds. But it's a real sourceof argument because every comic book fan has a different opinion.When we went into (`Batman') we decided to try to be true to it, butto do our own thing also.''   Though Keaton achieved stardom in such comedies as ``Mr. Mom''and ``Beetlejuice,'' he displays little of his antic humor as BruceWayne, and none as Batman.   ``I always try to do what the role requires, and I try to do adifferent role every time,'' he said. ``I discussed the role withTim as well as Jack (Nicholson). The character was clearly morepowerful if he was more internal. As Jack said to me in makeup oneday, `Just let the wardrobe act, kid.' There was great wisdom inthat statement. The real power came from within.   ``My natural tendency is to do more because you sometimes fearyou're not doing enough. The longer I'm an actor, the more Idiscover that less is more.''   Early reviews of ``Batman'' have not been the raves that WarnerBros. would dearly love. The Associated Press said it was``ultimately unsatisfying. ... The makers of the 1989 `Batman' can'tseem to make up their minds. Tim Burton ... seems overburdened withthe logistics of an immensely costly production.''   Rolling Stone called it a classic, but Time magazine found thestyle ``daunting and lurching'' and observed that the film ``prowls_ slowly, so slowly _ in search of grandeur, but it often findsmurk.''   Daily Variety termed ``Batman'' uneven and commented that ``JackNicholson's incandescent Joker overwhelms Michael Keaton's subduedtitle character.''   Films such as ``Rambo: First Blood Part II'' and ``Coming toAmerica'' overcame poor reviews to amass $100 million-plus grosses.If reviewers thumb down ``Batman,'' can it prove equallycritic-proof?   ``I hope so,'' says director Burton. ``You hope people will judgethe movie and not the merchandising.''   ``I don't care what anybody says, the movie's good,'' declaresKeaton. ``It's an awful lot of fun. How's that _ strong enough?''   ``Batman'' has been a 10-year crusade for producers Jon Petersand Peter Guber. Why so long?   ``Because we were making 30 other pictures, everything from `TheColor Purple' to `Flashdance' to `Caddyshack' to `The Witches ofEastwick,''' Peters said. ``We paid Tom Mankiewicz $750,000 and wentthrough five or six drafts and still came up with something that wastoo derivative, too much like `Superman.'''   ``Batman'' began to take shape with the addition of writer SamHamm and Tim Burton, a graduate of Disney animation who had directedonly two films, ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' and ``Beetlejuice.''   Peters recalled suggesting the role of the Joker to Nicholsonwhile filming ``The Witches of Eastwick'' on location in New England.   ``We were talking at 3 a.m. on the night before Jack had to dothe church sequence in which he denounced women and threw up overeverybody. I said he should play the Joker, and he said, `Are youcrazy? Here I am playing the devil and making every woman mad at me.You want to throw my career down the toilet?'''   After weeks of persuasion, Nicholson began to see possibilitiesin the role. Peters' first choice for Batman was Bill Murray. ``Iwanted an action picture that was funny.'' But after seeing``Beetlejuice,'' the producers chose Keaton. Sean Young (``No WayOut'') was cast as the press photographer Vicki Vale, but she wasinjured as filming began in England. Kim Basinger came to the rescue.   ``I got a call on Friday night in California that they wanted meMonday morning and I said, `You're out of your mind,''' Basingerrecalled. ``To fly to London and be there Sunday? I said, `You'velost it.' Ten minutes later I was on a plane in my mind. I knew Iwould wind up doing it.   ``I got off the plane and started gathering wardrobe and doingthe hundreds of things you need to do for a role. I started making(the character) up as I went along. ...   ``I don't have an `approach' to anything. I just dealt with thisfilm as if I was making a dramatic piece. Vicki Vale is the light ofthe movie; it's like `Phantom of the Opera' in the '80s. Tim Burton,the director, said that. It's very much a light and dark film. Thesetwo dark images, and I am the light. Vicki Vale brings the heart,the reality to the film. She asks Batman, `Do you love me?' That'sall she cares about: love.   ``She brings the normality, the human aspect. She grounds theboys when they get too feisty.''   In this era of mega-budgets, the cost of ``Batman'' has beenreported from $35 million to $50 million. The final word fromproducer Peters: ``Not counting prints and advertising, the actualcost was between $33 million and $35 million.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 18</NOTE></DOC>
