The performance of the two bug-killers, aimed atvegetable-crop pests, will be an important test not only forSan Diego-based Mycogen but for an emerging group of&quot;second-generation&quot; biopesticides and their makers, analystssay. Many growers have shunned biopesticides, despite theirenvironmental advantages, because most of them haven't beenas effective as conventional chemical sprays.</LP><TEXT>   Now, however, rising consumer concerns about food, soiland water contamination, stoked by periodic incidents likethe 1989 Alar apple scare, have created new demand forbiopesticides. First introduced 20 years ago, biopesticidesuse naturally occurring micro-organisms that produce toxinsagainst insects. Mycogen says that with genetic engineeringit has solved the biggest shortcoming of these natural bugpredators: their tendency to degrade quickly in theenvironment.   &quot;These are new and different; we haven't registered anygenetically altered {pesticides} before,&quot; says the EPAspokesman, Al Heier. While the manufacturing process isnovel, he says the EPA is comfortable with the products, MVPand MTrak, because they use a fairly common natural toxin.   Mycogen scientists have cloned the gene responsible forproducing this toxin, derived from Bacillus thuringiensis,and used genetic engineering techniques to insert it into thecell of another bacterium that can be mass-produced. Thecells are killed and encased in a tiny &quot;biocapsule&quot; thatpreserves the toxins until they are ingested by the targetpest.   These protective capsules make Mycogen's new products morepersistent than other biopesticides, says Joseph D. Panetta,director of regulatory affairs and quality assurance for thecompany. And the cells can't spread or multiply -- a bigconcern with genetically engineered pesticides -- becausethey are dead, he said.   MVP kills the diamondback moth and other caterpillar peststhat attack cabbage, broccoli, lettuce and other vegetables.North American growers currently spend about $120 million ayear for pesticides to combat those pests. The worldwidemarket is about $300 million, Mycogen estimates.   M-Trak's main target is the Colorado potato beetle, aravager of potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant. Mycogen estimatesthat the market to control those pests is about $40 millionin North America and $100 million world-wide. Both productshave been available since last year for experimental use on alimited number of acres.   The EPA notified Mycogen last week that MVP and M-Trakwill be exempt from residue tolerance checks. Food thatexceeds federal tolerance levels can be seized and destroyed.While the exemption has been granted to other biopesticides,Mycogen says its tests show that MVP and M-Trak work betterthan other biopesticides already on the market.   Still, MVP and M-Trak face stiff competition and won't beovernight successes, cautions Sano Shimoda, an analyst withSan Francisco-based Montgomery Securities Inc. &quot;Performanceis No. 1 with farmers; relative cost is second; the thirdconsideration is environmental,&quot; he says. Mycogen hasn'tdisclosed prices for its new products but has said they willbe competitive.   Farmers will use the products initially to eradicate peststhat are resistant to chemical agents, Mr. Shimoda predicts.The big question is whether MVP can move beyond the narrowerbiopesticide market and compete head-to-head with chemicalproducts. Biopesticides made by Abbott Laboratories andSandoz Ltd., among others, currently have only about a 1%share of the $20 billion a year worldwide pesticide market.The U.S. pesticide market makes up 25% of the world-widemarket.   Adoption of new pesticides is much slower than for humanpharmaceutical products, with which agriculturalbiotechnology products are often compared. Growers experimentwith new pesticides for two or three years on increasinglylarger crop patches before switching all of their fields.Farmers also need more education on how biopesticides work.&quot;They're accustomed to walking into the field and within afew hours seeing the bugs drop dead; it takes a couple ofdays&quot; for biopesticides, a Mycogen official says.   After being approved, MVP would go on sale in Florida andother warm-weather growing areas later this year. M-Trakwould be launched next spring. But it is unlikely that thenew agents will propel nine-year-old Mycogen into the blackanytime soon. Mycogen, a biological insecticide and herbicidemaker and researcher, is focused on &quot;building the business&quot;and expects to operate at breakeven, or perhaps small annuallosses of $1 million to $2 million over the next two years,says Jim Glynn, executive vice president and chief financialofficer. In 1990, Mycogen had a net loss of $4.5 million, or44 cents a share, and total revenue of $15 million.   Montgomery Securities' Mr. Shimoda forecasts total productsales of about $24 million for the company in 1994, including$9 million for MVP and $2.5 million for M-Trak. &quot;Mycogen hasin its sight the prospect of being a $75 million to $100million company in six or seven years&quot; and could grow fasterwith acquisitions and international sales, Mr. Shimoda says.&quot;MVP,&quot; he adds, &quot;could be a breakthrough product.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
