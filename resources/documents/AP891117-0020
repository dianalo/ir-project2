By not doing so, Rep. Thomas Luken said the Archives might behelping Philip Morris Cos. Inc. make ``a mockery'' of the federalban on cigarette advertisements on television and radio.   The Ohio Democrat revealed at a hearing Thursday that the agencyhad expressed its qualms in a letter to the company a year ago.Luken chairs the House Subcommittee on Transportation and HazardousMaterials, which is investigating the arrangement.   The agency had ``reservations about the appropriateness ofPhilip Morris' role in advertising the Bill of Rights exhibition,''said Susan Cooper, spokeswoman for the Archives, in the November1988 letter.   However, under an August agreement with Philip Morris, theArchives allowed the company to publish and broadcast promotions ofthe Bill of Rights' 200th anniversary in exchange for a $600,000donation to the National Archives Trust Fund. The materials carrythe names of both Philip Morris and the Archives.   The agreement has come under fire from anti-smoking groups andmembers of Congress.   The Archives and the Justice Department ``should pursue whetherthere is a violation'' or cause for possible prosecution, Lukensaid.   Claudine J. Weiher, deputy archivist, told the panel the agencyquestioned the ``propriety'' not the ``legality'' of theadvertising campaign.   ``What we reviewed these segments or ads for was to assureourselves in our own minds that no such advocacy was there,'' saidWeiher.   But an attorney for Philip Morris argued the nationallytelevised announcement is not restricted.   ``Even those who have tried to find fault with the Philip Morrisads have not, to my knowledge, asserted that the spots advertisecigarettes in the commonly understood sense of the term,'' saidRichard Wiley, a former chairman of the Federal CommunicationsCommission.   The ban ``extends only to messages that promote the sale or useof particular tobacco products,'' added Riley.   ``What our critics object to is not what is being said, but whois saying it,'' added David I. Greenberg, a Philip Morris vicepresident.   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. is the holding company for aconglomerate that produces a variety of consumer products includingKraft cheese, Maxwell House coffee and Oscar Mayer meats as well asMarlboro cigarettes.   ``Philip Morris is synonymous with cigarettes,'' said Luken,adding the letter showed the Archives had similar concerns.   ``Given the First Amendment issues relating to smoking, he (U.S.Archivist Don Wilson) is concerned that the context in which theexhibition would be advertised might lead to a negative publicresponse,'' Cooper said in the letter, dated Nov. 10, 1988.   As a federal government agency, ``we cannot appear to beassociated with the implicit endorsement of a philosophy behind aproduct,'' she added.   In fact, Cooper suggested the Archives work with another of thePhilip Morris corporate entities ``such as General Foods, with whomwe have worked in the past'' on the educational component of theBill of Rights campaign.   The company rejected the idea.   Weiher said the agency had rejected initial materials submittedby Philip Morris for the two-year campaign because they ``appearedto promote smoking.''</TEXT></DOC>
