I don't think so. In fact, Santa Clara's policy reminds me of our civil-service system. The three top scorers on a test are referred to an agency to decide who of the three best meets its needs. There's no rule that the number one finisher be hired first.    Such a system doesn't discard merit in favor of artificial hiring criteria. . . . The pool from which a person is hired consists only of those well-qualified for the job to be filled. Applicants must meet common standards while agencies can meet their specific needs.    Some people say the court's majority opinion . . . is a historic breakthrough for women's rights. Others side with the blistering dissent of Justice Scalia who fears it will transform civil-rights laws into &quot;An Engine for Discrimination.&quot;    To me the decision was neither historic nor disastrous. It's just common sense.    ---   Magazine editor Joseph Nocera, in the April 13 New Republic:    Texas was the first place I ever lived where people used the words &quot;free enterprise&quot; without smirking. In Rhode Island, when I was growing up, security was the preeminent value. The best jobs were thought to be the government jobs, because it was impossible to get fired. Unions were held in higher regard there than anyplace else in the country. Corporations, in general, were thought to be up to no good. And as for money, in New England money was a private and discreet thing, certainly not to be flaunted. Before I landed in Texas I never met anybody who openly and proudly admitted that his goal in life was to get rich. </TEXT></DOC>
