The purpose of this proposed rule is to add Georgia andSouth Carolina to the list of States for which alligator export would beapproved, and to issue Scientific Authority findings on a revised harvestprogram in Florida to enable continued export of alligators from that State.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scientific Authority Findings</ITAG>Article IV of CITES requires that an export permit for any specimen ofa species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certain findingshave been made by the Scientific Authority and Management Authority ofthe exporting country. The Scientific Authority must advise ``that suchexport will not be detrimental to the survival of that species'' beforea permit can be granted.The American alligator is listed in Appendix II to respond both to problemsof potential threat to the survival of American alligators [ConventionArticle II,2(a)] and its similarity in appearance to other crocodiliansthat are threatened with possible extinction (Convention Article II.2(b)).The Regional 10-year review of the Convention's Appendices confirmed thesuitability of this treatment, as set forth in the proposal that the Conferenceof the Parties adopted in 1979 to transfer this species to Appendix II.The marking of hides with specified tags and documentation of shipmentsof meat and parts, as well as the issuance of export permits, is consideredsufficient to address the issue of identification due to the similarityin appearance between American alligators and other listed species (seeManagement Authority findings for tag specification).Inasmuch as the alligator is also listed because of a potential threatto its survival, the Service must determine if exports will not be detrimentalto the survival of the American alligator itself.Guidelines developed for Scientific Authority advice on exports of Americanalligators under the provisions of Convention Article II.2(a), are summarizedas follows:A. Minimum requirements for biological information:  (1) Information on the condition of the population, including trends (themethod of determination to be a matter of State choice), and populationestimates where such information is available;  (2) Information on total harvest of the species;  (3) Information on distribution of harvest; and  (4) Habitat evaluation.  B. Minimum requirements for a management program:  (1) There should be a controlled harvest, methods and seasons to be a matterof State choice;  (2) All hides should be registered and marked; and  (3) Harvest level objectives should be determined annually by the State. In applying these guidelines, the Service considers the following typesof information on the conditions of the population: (a) A current estimate(if such information is available) of the total number of animals in thepreharvest population derived by extrapolating the number of animals perunit area in each of the major habitat types to obtain an estimate of thetotal number of animals where the number of animals per unit area is determinedby direct count, by indirect indications of abundance in the State, orby population modeling; (b) a description of ongoing research being conductedto assess the distribution, abundance, or general condition of the speciesin the State, with a summarization of results obtained, including resultsof any analyses of age structure or reproductive parameters; and (c) anassessment of long-term trends of the species in the State, and the relationshipof these trends to habitat conditions, management practices, harvest pressure,and/or other factors.  Information on anticipated harvest to be considered by the Service shouldinclude; (a) the number of animals to be harvested (by county or game managementunit, if data are available at these local level(s)); (b) the number ofalligator hunters expected to be licensed; and (c) the time of the harvestseason.  In the case of the alligator, as with most other wild animals, the resourceis monitored by a variety of techniques that yield information used inevaluating the condition of a population. As these data are accumulatedover time, they reflect trends and call attention to changes in the populations.Habitat information, indices of population size, age and sex structure,and harvest information, are all used to evaluate population status. Althoughthe Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982 provided that populationestimates are not to be required for the approval of export of AppendixII wildlife, if such estimates are provided by the States or are otherwiseavailable, they will be considered together with information of the typeslisted above in making findings on nondetriment.  The status of the American alligator has dramatically improved throughoutits range over the last 10 years. One of the primary reasons for this improvementhas been the effective management programs run by State wildlife agencies.The Service expects these management programs to continue to be effectivein conserving the American alligator in the future.  The export of American alligators taken in the 1986 through 1988 harvestseasons in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas was previously approved by theService (1 FR 31130). At that time, the Service found that ``current informationon the population status, management, and harvest'' available from thoseStates as well as other information collected by the Service, supporteda finding that the export of alligators taken in accordance with Stateregulations in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas during those harvest seasonswould not be detrimental to the survival of the species in those States. The States of South Carolina and Georgia have requested that the exportof alligators taken during State-supervised nuisance control programs bepermitted. In addition, the State of Georgia has requested approval forthe export of American alligators raised on ``farms'', and finally theState of Florida from which the export of alligators was previously approvedis planning to increase the areas in which alligators may be taken.Based on alligator population and habitat information received from theSouth Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department and their estimatedtake of up to 500 alligators in conjunction with their nuisance alligatorcontrol program, the Service proposes to issue Scientific Authority advicein favor of alligator export from the State. Based on the expected limitedtake under Georgia Department of Natural Resources' nuisance control programand upon available information indicating that the populations in Georgiaare stable within those areas with suitable habitat, the Service proposesto issue Scientific Authority advice to allow the export of alligatorstaken under this State's program. Furthermore, the export of alligatorsfrom designated, State-approved farms in Georgia represent animals bredin captivity and their export should not be detrimental to the survivalof the wild population. Therefore, the Service proposes to allow the exportof specimens from these ``farms''.The State of Florida implemented harvest programs on a limited number ofexperimental areas in 1986, and now plans to expand this program allowingharvest on areas throughout the State. The previously accepted populationmonitoring system continues to indicate a stable or increasing populationand the expanded program would retain harvest quotas on an annual basis.Based on the population information and proposed quotas developed by theFlorida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, the Service proposes to issueScientific Authority advice to continue to allow the export of alligatorstaken in Florida in 1988.Based upon information presented by Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina,and considering the basis for the species' listing on Appendix II of theConvention, the Service proposes to issue Scientific Authority advice infavor of export of alligators harvested in 1988 from these States, andproposes the addition of Georgia and South Carolina to the list of thoseStates already granted export approval for this species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management Authority Findings</ITAG>Exports of Appendix II species are to be allowed under the Convention onlyif the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimens were not obtainedin contravention of laws enacted for the protection of the involved species.The Service, therefore, must be satisfied that alligator hides, meat orproducts were not obtained in violation of State or Federal law in orderto allow export. Evidence of legal taking for American alligator is providedby Service-approved State tagging programs. The Service annually contractsfor the manufacture and delivery of special Convention animal-hide tagsfor export-qualified States. In a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, published on April 24, 1986 (51 FR 15548),the Service announced the introduction, use, and protection of a US-CITEStag symbol. This symbol appears on every Service-approved export tag toprovide legal evidence of export approval for certain Convention AppendixII listed species.Guidelines developed for Management Authority findings on State Americanalligator export programs, slightly modified from the 1986-1988 rule, underprovisions of Convention Article IV.2(b), are summarized as follows:(1) Current State alligator trapping and tagging, meat, and parts processingregulations must be on file with the Office of Management Authority;(2) Sample reporting forms, export tag, meat packing seal, and parts tagmust be on file with the Office of Management Authority;(3) The export tag must be durable and permanently locking, and must showU.S.-CITES logo, State of origin, year of take, species, and be seriallyunique;(4) The export tag, meat seal, and parts tag must be applied to all hides,meat or parts, within a minimum time after take or processing, as specifiedby State law, and such time should be as short as possible to minimizemovement of untagged hides, meat, or parts;(5) The tags or seals must be permanently attached, as mandated by theState;(6) All alligator harvesters and processors must be State registered;(7) All hide, meat, and parts dealers are to be State registered;(8) All State-registered alligator harvesters, processors, and dealersmust make available their alligator harvest and commerce data to the Stateon at least an annual basis, as specified by the State;(9) State-registered alligator dealers and licensed harvesters allowedto attach export tags to the hides must account for all tags received andmust return unused tags to the State within a specified time after theharvest period closes; and(10) Fully manufactured alligator hide products may be exported from theUnited States when the State-hide Convention export tags, removed fromhides contained in the manufactured products, are surrendered to the Serviceprior to export.<ITAG tagnum="84">Monitoring State Programs</ITAG>From monitoring existing State programs for the American alligator in Florida,Louisiana, and Texas, the Service expects these States will continue tosatisfy Convention requirements. States seeking for the first time to establisha harvest program for alligators should apply for Convention export approvalno later than January 31 of the year they plan to initiate such a program.To ensure that export-approved States maintain successful programs andthat export is not detrimental to the survival of the species, the Serviceplans to continue annual monitoring of State management and export markingprograms through evaluation of State information and export reports fromthe ports, no later than May 31 of each year.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Findings</ITAG>The Service proposes to approve exports of 1988 alligators harvested inFlorida, Georgia, and South Carolina on the grounds that both ScientificAuthority and Management Authority export requirements are satisfied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service requests comments and recognizes that a public comment periodis important concerning the Federal actions described herein. However,a standard 30-day comment period would additionally delay publication offinal findings for the export of alligators harvested in 1988, that inturn, may adversely affect those interested in exporting American alligators.The Service, therefore, finds that good cause exists, within the termsof 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, to grant a 10-daypublic comment period.The proposal is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Act of1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.)</T3>. The authors are S Ronald Singer, Office of Managementof Authority, and Dr. Charles W. Dane, Office of Scientific Authority.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>The Department had previously determined that the exportof alligators of various States taken in the 1986-1988 harvest seasons,was not a major Federal action that would significantly affect the qualityof the human environment within the meaning of section 102(a)(c) of theNational Envronmental Policy Act, therefore, the preparation of an environmentalImpact Statement was not required (48 FR 37494). Because these proposedfindings do not significantly differ from the previous export findings,the previous determination not to prepare an Environmental Impact Statementon export of aligators taken during the 1986-1988 harvest seasons in certainStates (51 FR 31130) remains appropriate. The Department had also previouslydetermined that such harvest was not a major rule under Executive Order12291 and did not have a significant economic affect on a substantial numberof small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).Because the existing rule treats exports on a State-by-State basis andproposes to approve export in accordance with a State management/exportprogram, the rule will have little effect on small entities in and of itself.This proposed rule does not contain any information collection requirementsthat require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 23</ITAG>Endangered and threatened wildlife, Exports, Fish, Imports, Plants (agriculture),Treaties.Accordingly, the Service proposes to amend Part 23 of Title 50, Code ofFederal Rgulations, as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 23_ENDANGERED SPECIES CONVENTION</ITAG>1.
