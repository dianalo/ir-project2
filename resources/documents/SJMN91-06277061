His airplane was out of gas at the Tehran airport. Could hehave some fuel?;   &quot;We'd like to&quot; get the plane filled up &quot;before we go muchfurther in this&quot; bargaining, North said as he and former national securityadviser Robert McFarlane tried desperately to win freedom for U.S. hostagesheld in Lebanon.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NORTH TAPES REVEALEDTIDBITS FILL IN THE GAPS OF IRAN-CONTRA HOSTAGENEGOTIATIONS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     North's fuel shortage was one of the tidbits which ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot;broadcast Wednesday night from secretly tape-recorded negotiating sessions ofthe Reagan administration's arms sales to Iran.;   The tapes have never beenplayed publicly before. Transcribed excerpts appeared in the congressionalreport on the Iran-Contra scandal in 1987. Although the recordings broadcastby ABC did not disclose substantive new details, they included some newmaterial and captured the flavor and tone of the negotiations.;   The Tehrantalks collapsed when the Iranians kept making additional demands, said HowardTeicher, a former National Security Council aide who went on the McFarlanemission to Tehran and appeared on &quot;Nightline.&quot;;   The Iranians asked that theU.S. government intervene with Kuwait to obtain the release of imprisonedIranians accused of terrorist attacks, according to the secret tape recordingsmade by a member of the U.S. delegation.;   &quot;We want a commitment from theU.S. government&quot; to talk to Kuwait, one of the Iranian negotiators saidthrough interpreter George Cave, a former CIA official.;   &quot;Well, I'm notgonna give that to him,&quot; replied North. &quot;I have no power nor authority to givethat commitment. And we have tried privately and on occasions very, verysecretly and we have been rebuffed, OK?&quot;;   McFarlane announced he was leavingTehran.;   &quot;I'm feeling very forlorn,&quot; the former national security advisertold the Iranians as he and the U.S. delegation prepared to leave.;   Did theAmericans fear the Iranians might hold them hostage?;   &quot;It certainly crossedmy mind,&quot; Teicher said on the TV program.;   But the U.S. plane was refueledand the Americans flew away.;   On the tapes, a frustrated North invokesPresident Reagan's name in an effort to move the hostage negotiationsforward.;   And businessman Albert Hakim, who was working with North, urgeddelivery of arms to the Iranians.;   &quot;I must be able to convey to my presidentby communicating with him very early tomorrow morning that it's within yourpower, and you are willing to cause an American to be released,&quot; North says onone tape. That was in a meeting with Iranian negotiators in late February1986, in an airport hotel in Frankfurt, Germany.;   An Iranian negotiatorspells out what his country sought from the bargaining at a time when hiscountry was at war with neighboring Iraq.;   &quot;We must get the Hawk missiles,&quot;says the unidentified Iranian. &quot;We must get intelligence reports of Iraqitroop strength. Iran is being destroyed. We need those missiles.&quot;;   &quot;OK,&quot;replied Hakim, who had been brought along to translate. &quot;Let's go ahead withdelivery of the TOWs (anti-tank missiles). Let's go ahead with thetransmission of the intelligence. And let's go ahead with the hostages.&quot;;  The Reagan administration kept its part of the bargain, delivering 1,000 TOWmissiles, but no hostages were released. The Iranians said they had gottenonly half the number of missiles they were supposed to get.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911003  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  570  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 3, 199100277061,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
