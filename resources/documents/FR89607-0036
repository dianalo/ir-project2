The functionalcomponents of the APP constitute a ``toolbox'' of standard elements thatcan be used to develop and maintain portable applications. The APP is anopen systems architecture based upon non-proprietary standards.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of the most neglected aspects of applications software portabilityis the requirements to maintain a consistent user interface across allsystems on which the application resides. The FIPS for User Interface isthe first step in responding to a critical need within the Federal communityfor a set of tools to develop standard user interfaces. It is the firstin a series which we intend to adopt as user interface technology progressesand consensus emerges.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This initial FIPS is based upon the X Window System developed by theMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) X Consortium. The X WindowSystem assumes a client/server model of distributed computing, and userinterface applications based upon bit-mapped graphic displays. With thissytem, software vendors can develop applications that incorporate suchinterfaces without being concerned about the underlying display hardwareon which the application runs. In addition, the application need not beresident on the same computer system as the one to which the user's displayis attached.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This FIPS is not intended to specify a government-wide style or ``lookand feel'', nor is it intended as a specification of a general programminginterface for graphics applications. It is intended to lay a foundationfor standards that will help Federal agencies develop and acquire network-based,bit-mapped graphic user interface applications.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The X Window System program services and interface specificationsadopted by this FIPS provide the foundation for a set of vendor independentbuilding blocks that can be used to develop user interface applications.These specifications, however, must be extended to provide the additionalprogram services and interface specifications for user interface applications.These additional specification will be based on the NIST User Interfacereference model shown in Figure 1.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The NIST User Interface reference model is a layered model which definesthe program services and interfaces required for network-based, bit-mappedgraphic user interface applications. This FIPS covers the Data Stream Encoding,Data Stream Interface and Subroutine Foundation layers of the framework.These layers provide a foundation upon which standard components for higherlayers of the framework may be built.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,xs60  </C><T4>NIST User Interface Reference Model</T4><H1>Model layer</H1><H1>System component</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">6.

In the X Window System, the Data StreamEncoding is the X ``wire'' or ``network'' protocol. As a specificationof message formats, the Data Stream Encoding is indepenent of operatingsystem, programming language, or network communication.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Layer 1: Data Stream Interface  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Data Stream Interface specifies a function call interface to buildthe messages defined in the Data Stream Encoding layer. In X, this interfaceis the Xlib function library. The Data Stream Interface converts parameterspassed from a program into the bit stream that is transmitted over thenetwork, and converts messages from the server into values passed to theprogram. The Data Stream Interface provides access to basic graphic functionsfrom Layer 0, and may support system functions such as error handling andsyncronization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Layer 2: Subroutine Foundation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Subroutine Foundation uses features of the Data Stream Interfaceto provide the means to build components of window interfaces such as scrollbars. Functions often provided by the Subroutine Foundation include initializationand destruction of objects, management of events and object hierarchy,and the saving and restoration of interface state. The Subroutine Foundationcan be thought of as a toolkit with which to build toolkits. The X WindownSystem's Xt Intrinsics set is a Subroutine Foundation for X.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Layer 3: Toolkit</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Components such as menus, pushbuttons, scroll bars, or help boxescan be used to build an application interface. These ``prefabricated''components make up the Toolkit. The components of Toolkits vary with vendors,but they typically contain most of the common user interface elements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Layer 4: Presentation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Presentation layer determines the appearance of the user interface,including aspects such as size, style, and color. It specifies how thecomponents in the Toolkit should be composed to create windows. The appearancemay be specified using a User Interface Language (UIL) and may be enforcedby a window manager, which controls the size and location of windows, anddecorates windows in the style specified by the user. For example, an applicationprogram will provide text for a title bar, but the window manager determinesthe appearance of the title bar.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Layer 5: Dialogue</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Dialogue layer coordinates the interaction between the computersystem and the user. It can be thought of as a mediator between the userand the applicaiton program. Communication between user and applicationprogram is through the Dialogue layer, which may be implemented by a UserInterface Management System (UIMS). The user/application interaction isspecified by a ``dialogue'' that associates user actions, such as clickingon a menu item, with application actions. Some UIMS tools can accept adialogue and a presentation style from which to generate an instance ofthe UIMS that controls the interaction between user and application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Layer 6: Application</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The application program implements the functions required by the user.Its interaction with the user is through the Dialogue layer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">PLANS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FIPS for User Interface is an integral component of the APP. Aswith other components of the APP, the specifications adopted by this FIPSare expected to evolve as the technology matures, as additional experienceusing the technology is gained, and as consensus broadens in the nationaland international standards arena. NIST has established a process to ensurethat the FIPS will evolve in a manner that serves the interests of bothusers who employ these specifications to acquire products and vendors whouse them to build products.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Both users and vendors are included in this process through an ongoingseries of APP User Workshops and APP Implementor Workshops. The user workshopsprovide information on the evolving definition of the User Interface componentas well as other APP specifications. They also serve as a forum for usersto identify user priorities and to provide input and feedback. The implementorworkshops provide a forum for vendors to discuss the APP specificationsand to provide feedback on the technical merits of the NIST proposals.The implementor workshops are designed to ensure that there is consensuson the part of the vendors to building products to the evolving APP specifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[1] Scheifler, R.W., and J.
