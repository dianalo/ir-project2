Guerrilla officials said the meeting was postponed indefinitelybecause rival groups were deadlocked on issues including who shouldhead a provisional government to replace Afghanistan's communistregime.   Representatives of eight Afghan Shiite guerrilla groups based inIran refused to attend after the seven guerrilla groups based inPakistan reneged on an agreement to give the Shiites 100 seats onthe council.   The larger, more powerful Pakistani-based groups from the rivalSunni Moslem sect said the Shiite demand was excessive, but thatthey hoped to reach an agreement to include the Iranian parties.   ``Nobody knows what is happening. The leaders cannot decide onwho will lead the government and there is much disagreement,'' saida senior guerrilla official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Delegates, who included military commanders, political leadersand academics, adjourned after electing two leaders of thePakistani-based groups to head the council.   Nabi Mohammadi was elected chairman and Rasul Saiaf was appointedsecretary.   The council meeting was called to form a provisional governmentand clear the way for elections in Afghanistan now that theinsurgents, who have been fighting their nation's communist regimefor 10 years, appear close to victory.   The communist government is not expected to survive for long onceSoviet forces complete their withdrawal, expected by Wednesday.   But the Pakistani-based guerrilla groups are deeply divided andare scrambling for power. Some Afghan leaders fear that without abroad-based government there could be a bloody power strugglebetween the groups, which often have clashed.   About 350 delegates showed up Friday for the heavily guardedmeeting; 526 had been expected.   ``God is great!'' the delegates chanted when journalists wereallowed inside the hall briefly.   Mohammad Karim Khalili, chairman of the guerrilla alliance inIran, said the Pakistani-based groups proposed renewed talks withthe Shiites and hinted they would give them 60 council seats.   But Khalili said his alliance would accept nothing but theinitial offer of 100 seats.   ``We don't want any new discussions. We want to realize ouragreement,'' he told The Associated Press.   One guerrilla official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe council meeting had been postponed indefinitely and ``will notbe complete without representation from Afghans living in Iran.''   Delegates had been instructed to remain in Islamabad, and someguerrilla officials said the council might reconvene by Monday.   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, acting chairman of the alliance ofPakistan-based guerrillas, worked out the agreement earlier thismonth to give the Iranian-based guerrillas 100 council seats. Theagreement was intended to get the Shiites take part in the council.   But leaders of other Pakistani-based groups rejected Mojaddidi'sdeal, either because of religious opposition to Shiites or becauseof the view that 100 seats was excessive.   The Pakistani parties each got 60 council seats.   The Shiite groups are much smaller than the seven Sunni guerrillaparties. Khalili said about 30 percent of Afghans are Shiites, butmost pre-war estimates put the figure at about 15 percent.   Afghan leaders denied reports in Pakistan that Mojaddidi had beenremoved as chairman of the Sunni alliance for making a deal with theIranian-based guerrillas. Leaders of the groups in Pakistan taketurns serving as chairman of their alliance.   Afghan communists seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Sovietforces entered Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the regime against theguerrillas, and stayed for nine years.</TEXT></DOC>
