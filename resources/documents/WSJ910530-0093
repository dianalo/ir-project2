O'Brien, who was one of the leadersof Bankers Trust Co.'s successful efforts in leveragedbuy-out lending, will move to a similar post at ManufacturersHanover Trust Co.   Mr. O'Brien, 47 years old, will become a managing directorat the main unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in charge oflending for acquisitions and lending to energy and mediacompanies.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. O'Brien, who worked at Bankers Trust for 22 years,said the recent reorganization of the bank's corporatefinance department &quot;created a turning point&quot; that caused himto consider leaving. In the reorganization announced twoweeks ago, which will result in about 200 layoffs, Mr.O'Brien's responsibilities were narrowed.   The volume of bank lending for acquisitions and leveragedbuy-outs, which had boosted Bankers Trust's profits in thelate 1980s, has slowed significantly in the past two years.And in a recent presentation to Wall Street analysts, seniorexecutives of Bankers Trust said they expected future growthto come largely from efforts to help big corporations managefinancial risks.   Mr. O'Brien said Bankers Trust &quot;is continuing to move in adifferent direction&quot; but said he isn't leaving because of thenew emphasis on risk management.   At Manufacturers Hanover, Mr. O'Brien will report to MarkG. Solow, a group executive in charge of corporate lendingwho formerly competed with Mr. O'Brien as head ofManufacturers's leveraged buy-out lending efforts.   At Bankers Trust, Mr. O'Brien once was co-head of merchantbanking and a member of the bank's merchant bankingcommittee, which supervised takeover lending, investing andadvisory work. Under the reorganization, Mr. O'Brien was oneof two executives responsible for Bankers Trust'srelationships with financial intermediaries, such as buy-outfirms and investment banking firms.   Bankers Trust didn't immediately name a successor to Mr.O'Brien, who will start at Manufacturers Hanover in June.</TEXT></DOC>
