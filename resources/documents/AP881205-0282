SEARLES</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Public Service Co. of Colorado announced Monday itplans to end nuclear operations by June 30, 1990, at theproblem-ridden Fort St. Vrain power plant, the nation's onlyhelium-cooled nuclear reactor.   A decision on whether to convert the plant to a fossil fuelfacility will be made before the end of 1989, utility spokesman MarkSieverts said.   ``Don't leave the impression that the plant could be shut downtomorrow. Our plans are to run it through 1989 and into 1990,''Sieverts said.   PSC earlier had announced that if it could not find third-partyassistance to continue operating the plant as a nuclear facility, itwould cease nuclear operations in 1991 or 1992. The plant islicensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate through2008.   Sieverts said decommissioning of the nuclear power plant couldtake up to 55 years. ``The initial work is just four to five yearsand then it sits for the dismantling process which would be about 55years down the road.''   Fort St. Vrain employs a unique helium-cooled reactor found inFrance but not elsewhere in the United States, and the plant has hada troubled history since it began providing electricity in 1976.   The 330-megawatt facility 35 miles north of Denver never wasallowed by the NRC to operate for any length of time at 100 percentof capacity because of problems that caused numerous shutdowns.   A spate of equipment problems in 1984 led to the plant being shutdown for 22 months. In July 1986, NRC Commissioner James Asselstinetold a congressional subcommittee Fort St. Vrain was one of the 10worst-run nuclear power plants in the nation.   In the fall of 1986, PSC executives ordered a $101 millionwritedown of the facility, and in October 1987 a fire in the turbinebuilding caused millions of dollars worth of damage.   The plant has been shut down since last July for scheduledrepairs on its four helium circulator units. It is expected toresume electricity generation in January.   PSC had said earlier it had three options for Fort St. Vrain'sfuture: Shut down the plant and remove everything of use; convert itto a coal- or gas-fired facility, or find a third party interestedin taking over the plant. Sieverts said the company is now left withthe first two options.   How many of the 520 jobs associated with the nuclear power plantwill be lost in 1990 has not yet been determined, Sieverts said.   In a prepared statement, R.O. Williams, PSC's senior vicepresident of nuclear operations, said ``...we will not be able toretain our entire (plant) workforce after we discontinue nuclearoperations.''   Williams said he would meet with plant employees Tuesday tooutline the general plan.   Once nuclear operations end, defueling and decommissionactivities will begin, officials said Monday.   Defueling involves removing fuel from the reactor core andshipping the spent fuel to a federal storage site.   Decommissioning includes removing and shipping major reactorcomponents and providing security for safe storage until the reactorcan be dismantled and the facility released to unrestricted use.   ``We do have one fuel cell at the plant site that we do not planto load into the reactor,'' said Sieverts. ``We're looking at theoptions of what to do with that unused fuel. It's a one-of-a-kindtechnology and that fuel is also one-of-a-kind fuel. It would haveto be reprocessed'' for use in other reactors, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
