The ruling by U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins followedshort-lived walkouts Tuesday and Wednesday by groups ofInternational Association of Machinist members. Wednesday's actionscame as management and union officials met to resolve the dispute.   ``The federal court saw that there were two sides to this andgave us the opportunity to continue on harmoniously and try to workthings out,'' said Charles Bryan, president of the union's Miamilocal.   Eastern said operations continued normally despite thecontroversy, which boiled over Tuesday afternoon in a walkout by upto 1,000 machinists at Miami International Airport.   The job action lasted about three hours, and management personnelreplaced baggage handlers and other ground services workers. Twoother small actions occurred Wednesday morning.   ``I consider it a victory for Eastern Airlines,'' said managementattorney David Ross after Atkins rejected his request for atemporary injunction. ``The union has admitted in open court thatthe work stoppages were illegal, and they have promised the federaldistrict judge that they will not do it again.''   Union leaders said they did not call for the walkouts and saidthey were spontaneous. Company spokesman Robin Matell blamed it on``public posturing'' by the machinists, whose 16-month-old contractdispute with management has a March 3 deadline for settlement.   Matell said the meeting Wednesday continued discussions fromTuesday on the suspensions for three days each of eight to 10Machinists who refused to work overtime required by their contract.The Machinists said the company failed to show a need for the extrawork.   ``This is a decision management interprets, when there is aneed,'' Matell said.   A union member said the strike was a spontaneous action from therank and file, crediting ``the pride of our workers'' with sparkingthe action.   ``The company demands from them they stay the overtime and theyrefused to do it. They have to prove that they really need theovertime and they can't do that,'' said Orlando Trujillo.   ``Nobody has the right to require overtime in certainconditions,'' said Ronald Orr, district general chairman ofMachinists' union.   ``We feel that if airplanes are grounded and delayed, people haveto work the overtime. But if it's not grounded and delayed, theperson has the right not to work it,'' Orr said.   Union sources said baggage handlers started Tuesday's walkout.They would be particularly hard hit if Eastern imposes its finalcontract offer, calling for $150 million in cuts, after thefederally imposed 30-day cooling-off period ends March 3.   No other airports were affected by the action and no flights werecancelled.   Machinists locals around the country are voting this week onwhether to authorize a strike if the March 3 deadline passes. Unionofficials expect overwhelming support for strike authorization.   The Miami local's 4,000 members will vote Thursday. Mechanicsmake up about half of the 8,500-member union, which includes morethan a quarter of all Eastern employees. The other members arebaggage handlers, ramp agents and other ground services workers.</TEXT></DOC>
