(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker pleadedinnocent today to federal charges of diverting millions of dollarsin donations from his followers and using the money to support hislavish lifestyle.   ``I pleaded not guilty to all charges,'' Bakker said after thearraignment. ``I am definitely not guilty of any charges in thisindictment.''   Bakker made no comment during the hearing, but defense attorneyGeorge T. Davis asked U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor to impose a gagorder in the case.   Davis read parts of an interview published Jan. 2 in whichretired U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, who presided over thePTL bankruptcy case, called the founder of the religiousbroadcasting empire a ``sawed-off little runt.''   Davis also said Reynolds described Bakker as ``a thief.''   ``We can't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundatedwith pretrial negative publicity, especially from a federal judge,''Davis said. ``How can we prevent this? This guy is a loose cannon.He's already gone overboard.''   Deborah Smith, a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor handling thecase, said the government was willing to agree to a gag order.However, she questioned Davis' motives, saying prosecutors wereconcerned that his statements were part of a strategy to get achange of venue in the case.   Taylor asked the attorneys to consult with each other over thenext two days and present a draft of a gag order to him by Thursday.   Taylor scheduled Bakker's trial for the February term of court,but set no specific date.   Bakker and three of his former top aides at the nearby PTLministry in Fort Mill, S.C., were indicted Dec. 5 after a 16-monthfederal grand jury investigation into PTL's operation under Bakker'sleadership.   Bakker, 48, and Richard Dortch, 57, his former top deputy, eachwere charged with 24 counts of mail and wire fraud and withconspiracy. They were accused of conspiring to defraud PTLcontributors to support their lavish lifestyles and of divertingmore than $4 million in PTL money for their personal use.   Last week, Dortch waived his right to appear at today'sarraignment and entered innocent pleas to all counts.   Harold Bender, another Bakker attorney, said he has heardspeculation that Dortch may seek a separate trial.   Also indicted last month were brothers David and James Taggart.They entered innocent pleas Dec. 15 to charges of tax evasion andconspiring to impede the IRS in tax collection. Taylor tentativelyscheduled their trial for the February term.   David Taggart, Bakker's former personal aide, and James Taggart,PTL's former interior decorator, were accused in a separateindictment Dec. 5 of using more than $1.1 million of PTL funds forpersonal expenditures.   Bakker and the three other defendants were released on $50,000unsecured bond on Dec. 15 by Taylor, who also imposed travelrestrictions.   Bakker resigned from the PTL in 1987 after he admitted he had anaffair with church secretary Jessica Hahn and paid her money to keepquiet. Three months later, PTL filed for protection from itscreditors under federal bankruptcy law.   Last month a Canadian businessman bought PTL's assets, includingits Christian theme park, at a bankruptcy auction. The fate of PTL'sreligious operations, which were spun off by the bankruptcy courtinto the non-profit Heritage Ministries, is unclear.   Bakker and his wife, Tammy, began broadcasting ``The Jim andTammy Show'' from their leased home near Charlotte earlier thismonth.</TEXT></DOC>
