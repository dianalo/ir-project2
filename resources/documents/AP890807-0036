No injuries were immediately reported, but electrical service tomany of the island's 65,000 residents was cut off when thehurricane hit Sunday.   The National Hurricane Center at Coral Gables, Fla., early todaydiscontinued a hurricane warning for Bermuda but warned small craftto remain in port because of high winds and seas.   A police spokesmen, Inspector Roger Sherrett, said commercialflights were to resume their normal schedules today after mostflights were canceled Sunday.   Forecasters said the storm was expected to stay out of range ofthe continental United States but could cause problems for shippers.   Police Sgt. John Instone of Bermuda's emergency services saidone coastal road was blocked and large parts of the island werewithout power.   About 20 boats, most of them moored in the Hamilton harbor, werereported sunk or adrift. About 15 homes were damaged from floodingand winds that tore apart roofs and knocked down walls.   ``I think everyone was far better prepared for Dean than theywere for Hurricane Emily in 1987,'' Sherrett said.   No one was killed in that storm, but there was $35 million indamage, officials have said.   The winds reached their peak over Bermuda at about 2 p.m. EDTSunday, gusting up to 113 mph, said Lt. Caron Ruppe at Bermuda'sU.S. Naval Air Station.   She said the center of the hurricane came within 15 miles ofBermuda.   The hurricane center in Florida said the storm dumped three tofive inches of rain.   The center said that at midnight Sunday the center of thehurricane was near latitude 35.0 north and longitude 64.8 west or185 miles north of Bermuda. It reported the storm was moving northat about 17 mph and would gradually turn toward the northeast andweaken somewhat today.   Dean, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, became atropical storm Monday night, passed the hurricane threshold of 74mph winds Tuesday and threatened the northern Caribbean beforeshifting north.</TEXT></DOC>
