About 500 of the plant's 1,264 employees have finished two-thirdsof a six-year schedule of projects to replace old equipment andimprove safeguards at the 39-year-old plant.   In contrast, only 123 of the workers were involved in cleanup ofradioactive contamination at the facility, which processes uraniumthe government refines elsewhere for use in nuclear weapons.   The construction work is defended by the plant owner, the U.S.Department of Energy and the plant operator, Westinghouse MaterialsCo. of Ohio. Both claim the projects will improve environmentalsafety and production at the site 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.   ``There is no construction that I am aware of that would fallunder the category of expanding production capability,'' saidWestinghouse spokesman Bob Walker. ``There are a number ofimprovements and construction projects that, while related toproduction, are environmental or safety-related.''   The Energy Department scheduled $88 million worth of constructionat Fernald from 1985 to 1991. About $7 million worth of projectsthat would have increased production capacity have been canceledbecause demand for uranium at the plant has fallen sharply as othergovernment reactors have closed.   A report by the Energy Department, known as the ``2010 Report,''recommended closing the plant by 1994. Former President Reaganconcurred with the report and passed it along to Congress.   The recommendation, however, has no legal force.   ``We're supposed to maintain the feasibility of production untilwe're phased out,'' Pete Kelley, a Westinghouse spokesman told TheCincinnati Enquirer in a story published Saturday.   Neighbors of the facility have sued the plant's former operator,National Lead of Ohio, alleging it allowed unsafe amounts ofchemical and radioactive pollution into the atmosphere, puttingtheir health at risk and depleting the value of their property.   The Energy Department has acknowledged the pollution in documentsfiled in the suit pending in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati.   Critics question using money for construction on a plant thegovernment wants to close.   ``It's typical. ... Money that obviously should be used forcleanup is being frittered away on projects they admit will not beneeded,'' said Tom Carpenter, a spokesman for the GovernmentAccountability Project, a Washington-based lobbying group.   Bob Alvarez, a spokesman for Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said itmakes no sense ``to pour money into revitalizing the facility whenthere are problems that will just fester and get worse.''   But Bruce Boswell of Westinghouse, the plant's president, saidthe facility must be maintained in good condition because itscapacity may still be needed.   ``Although the 2010 report says we'll operate just until 1994,that doesn't mean everything here will be demolished then,'' Kelleysaid. ``And we do have production quotas for the next few years.''</TEXT></DOC>
