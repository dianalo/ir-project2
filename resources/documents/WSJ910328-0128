Living wills are documents in which people specify inadvance whether they want life-sustaining medical treatmentsif they become desperately ill. The use of living wills iswidely advocated; more than 40 states have laws giving thesedocuments legal status in treatment decisions. But the numberof people who have written such directions is small, andlittle is known about whether patients' wishes are granted.</LP><TEXT>   Researchers at the University of North Carolina at ChapelHill found that in 25% of cases, medical treatment given tonursing home patients who had written living wills differedfrom care they had requested. In one case, a patient whorequested no mechanical breathing assistance received suchcare for respiratory failure during a seizure. In another, apatient with terminal congestive heart-failure wasn'thospitalized -- despite the patient's contrary directions --after a doctor and family members determined that no benefitwould be gained from hospitalization. The patient died in thenursing home.   &quot;The data suggest that in caring for incapacitatedpatients, physicians balance respect for (patient wishes)with other competing ethical principles to make what theybelieve are the wisest decisions,&quot; say Marion Danis andcolleagues in an article in today's New England Journal ofMedicine.   The authors noted that even though the wills were oftenignored, in most cases, patients' directives were followed.Use of living wills shouldn't be considered futile, theysaid. &quot;The use of such directives is in its infancy, and weneed to define and grapple with their limitations before wecan use them optimally,&quot; say the authors.   In a separate report in the same journal, researchers atMassachusetts General Hospital and elsewhere found thatpeople imagining themselves desperately ill with a poorprognosis would choose against lifesustaining treatment about70% of the time.   Linda L. Emanuel and colleagues also found that about 90%of 405 people seen as outpatients at the hospital as well as102 people who weren't under medical treatment favored use ofliving wills. Healthy young people were just as interested insuch planning as those over 65 who were in fair or poorhealth. But less than 20% of those surveyed had taken stepsto write a living will.</TEXT></DOC>
