Eventually, perhaps within a decade, the plan also calls for theelimination of domestic programs that distort international tradein farm commodities.   But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the detailedplan, which will be presented formally Wednesday in Geneva to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would not get rid of allgovernment farm aid.   ``There is nothing here that precludes any nation from having asafety net for its farmers,'' he said.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate AgricultureCommittee, said U.S. agricultural policy ``will not be made inGeneva or some foreign capital. It will be made by Congress, whichmust approve any final GATT agreement before it can become law inthis country.''   Leahy added in a statement, ``I will not abandon our farmers tounfair competition. I will also not allow the administration toabandon them either.''   The current round of talks under the 97-nation GATT began inPunta del Esta, Uruguay, on Sept. 20, 1986, and will conclude atthe end of 1990.   Yeutter, who joined U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills at anews conference, said the plan now going before GATT is not muchdifferent from the initial U.S. proposal made in 1987, although itis ``much more comprehensive, much more specific'' than the earlierplan.   Hills said the agriculture proposal ``would mean that America'sfarmers could compete against foreign farmers based on price andquality, rather than on the depth of a foreign government'spocketbook'' or the height of a trade barrier.   The U.S. objective in the GATT talks has been to gain improvedmarket access for American goods and services, including major farmcommodities such as grain, oilseeds, cotton and livestock products.   Yeutter said the U.S. proposal calls for gradually scaling downor eliminating quotas and other non-tariff barriers by convertingthem into tariffs over 10 years.   He said safeguards would be allowed for temporary protectionagainst countries dumping their goods _ selling them belowproduction cost   Export subsidies would be phased out over five years, Yeuttersaid. The export subsidies maintained by the European EconomicCommunity have been a sore point with U.S. trade officials for years   Under the proposal, some domestic subsidies would have a ``redlight'' designation and be eliminated gradually, those with a``yellow light'' designation would be watched for possible furthernegotiation, and those with ``green light'' designation, such asconservation programs, would proceed.   Yeutter stressed that no move would be made unilaterally by theUnited States and that no farm program would be altered unlessother countries did likewise.   ``If we travel down this correct road, we will travel it only inconjunction with our trading partners,'' he said. ``Whether or notwe do so is now up to them.''   Yeutter said he doubted if the GATT proposal would significantlyalter the debate in Congress on new farm legislation due next year.He said he hoped that the 1990 farm legislation will become lawbefore the Uruguay Round of trade talks conclude.   Assuming the trade negotiations are successful, he said, ``Wewill make modifications in that (farm) legislation in 1991.''   Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, saidhis organization has ``some real concerns'' about the U.S.proposal, particularly in the interpretation of``trade-distorting'' subsidies.   ``We see encompassed within there a call to eliminate domesticfarm programs and farm policy,'' Swenson said in a telephoneinterview.   But Swenson added that the union has supported the strengtheningof trade rules in regard to direct export subsidies and that thesecould be reduced or eliminated so long as other countries didlikewise.   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,said the United States holds an advantage by being first in line atGATT with its proposals.   ``We're going to again set the tone for this,'' he said. ``Soours will be the one that's under discussion.''   Kleckner said the Farm Bureau ``believes that the thrust of thisproposal is correct.''</TEXT></DOC>
