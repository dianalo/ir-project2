STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germany's Communist Party will considersocial reforms but will stick to a strict socialist ideology andmaintain its grip on power, a high-ranking party official saidtoday.   But there were indications of differences within the partyhierarchy over how to deal with an increasingly agitated populacedemanding more freedoms from the hard-line government.   West German media speculated today that 77-year-old ErichHonecker may be forced to step down as East German leader.   Some Communist Party leaders warned Honecker in a Politburomeeting on Wednesday that unless calls for democratic reforms areurgently addressed, he could face labor unrest, party sources said.   After the two-day meeting ended, the Politburo maintained apublic unity that offered firm support for the policies of the pastbut offered an olive branch to a growing movement for reform.   The Politburo said in a statement: ``All expressions of opinionand suggestions for attractive socialism in (East Germany) areimportant. We are open to discussions.''   But any reforms ``will serve the further development ofsocialism,'' said Otto Reinhold, a party Central Committee memberand head of the government's Academy for the Social Sciences.   ``There is a need for clear positions from the party, as to howthe socialist system can be further shaped,'' Reinhold said in acommentary carried today by the official news agency ADN and thestate newspaper Berliner Zeitung.   ADN said he wanted to distinguish the role of the party in EastGermany from that in some other socialist countries. The governmentin East Berlin has long emphasized it rejects the democraticreforms taking place in Poland and Hungary.   Baerbel Bohley, a co-founder of the opposition group New Forum,described the Politburo statement as a ``verbal shift that does nottake into account real life.''   In an interview with the RIAS radio in West Berlin, Ms. Bohleysaid: ``In dialogue, there must be also confrontations, and thosewho are trying to avoid confrontations are not for real dialogue.''   Meanwhile, the mayor of Dresden, Wolfgang Berghofer, promised tocontinue talks with the reform-minded Lutheran church and othergroups in the city but flatly ruled out accepting any demands madeby New Forum.   ``We are continuing to talk with one another,'' Berghofer toldthe East German newspaper Junge Welt. ``But I said that I am notready to accept any demands from the New Forum.''   New Forum has been seeking greater openness in East Germansociety and meaningful elections. Any changes in those areas wouldhave to come from the central government, not the local level.   The European Parliament, meanwhile, called on East Germany todayto release those who have been ``arbitrarily'' arrested innationwide demonstrations and to end police actions againstcitizens trying to flee the nation.   The European parliamentarians approved the criticism of EastGermany in a resolution unanimously adopted in Strasbourg, France.   In West Germany, the ZDF television network, the HessischeRundfunk radio in Frankfurt and the mass-circulation Bild newspaperspeculated Honecker will soon step down.   ``As of Wednesday evening, a resignation could no longer bediscounted,'' added the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitungtoday.   The East German sources said high-ranking Communist officialshad demanded Honecker deliver a report on the ``criticalsituation'' of the nation by Friday. In the past month, nearly50,000 people have fled to the West and the country has seen itslargest street protests since 1953.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reportedresistance within the security forces and the state-controlled newsmedia to the government's harsh weekend crackdown on nationwidepro-democracy protests.   The Politburo, in its statement, reaffirmed its commitment tosocialism, saying the answers to current problems ``are not to befound in the capitalist past.''   The Politburo hinted at possible changes including more freeexpression in the rigidly controlled news media and greater freedomto travel.   Party sources said another Politburo member, Egon Krenz, wasresponsible for the decision to order security forces _ who beatand arrested hundreds of protesters over the weekend _ to showrestraint during demonstrations Monday in Leipzig, East Berlin andDresden.</TEXT></DOC>
