Yes, predict some students of organizational science whosee an ebbing in that favorite pastime, office politics.Zandy Leibowitz, president of Conceptual Systems, a SilverSpring, Md., consulting firm, believes the 1990s &quot;will be theera of competence,&quot; with success based on masterfulperformance, not mastery of Machiavelli.   Employers are realizing the corporate jungle is moreself-fulfilling prophecy than necessity, claims JonathanKlein, assistant professor at Rutgers University. Peoplearen't power-mongering by nature, he argues, but learn&quot;pre-emptive, political behavior.&quot; Mr. Klein puts hisorganization class through exercises to illustrate that whileat first one is &quot;richly rewarded for knifing {people} in theback,&quot; retaliation follows, trust is lost, and productivitydeclines.   Sally Helgesen, author of &quot;The Female Advantage,&quot; arguesthat the advent of women managers will help curb politics.The corporate ladder is a male model, she contends,reflecting that men often want distance between themselvesand underlings. Women, she argues, are more likely to createa management &quot;web&quot; that draws people together.   &quot;Leaner and meaner&quot; organizations also could actuallybring relief. That's because companies with fewer layers ofmanagers must redistribute the power. Xerox, for example, isencouraging teamwork and evaluating performance in waysdesigned to override old-boy loyalties.   Politicking still thrives at most corporations, oftenexacerbated by the takeover atmosphere, consultantsacknowledge. Still, asserts Ms. Helgesen, aggressiveopportunism has &quot;an obsolete, '80s elitist feel to it.&quot;                                                                                                          Congress May Rescue   Seniors' Job Benefits                                                                                                          CONGRESS IS CLOSE to tackling a billion-dollar issue:Employers' right to discriminate against older workers inpaying benefits.   The bill would overturn the 1989 Supreme Court ruling thatallowed employers to tell older workers something like: &quot;Youwon't get as much life, health or disability insurance asyour younger colleagues. It just costs us too much.&quot; For twodecades, age-discrimination laws were applied to benefits aswell as employment issues. But the court's &quot;Betts&quot; rulinggave employers &quot;great freedom,&quot; says Henry Saveth, a benefitsconsultant.   The proposed bill would largely restore things the waythey were, resolving some pending cases. One involvesWestinghouse plant closings where younger employees gotseverance pay and pension, while those above 60 got onlypension. The law also would make some apparent concessions toemployers, including giving them clear license to reduceolder workers' severance in an early-retirement window ifthey paid retiree health benefits. But Mr. Saveth believesthe bill would also make such windows harder to execute,leading more employers simply to fire people.   The bill is likely to come on the floor in the next sixweeks and bipartisan sponsors expect it to be passed. Butemployers have stepped up their lobbying, and the White Househas become a wild card. While the Justice Department arguedagainst the Betts decision, and the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission helped draft the bill, theadministration recently hinted at a veto.                                                                                                          Whose Mission Is It?   You Should Know                                                                                                          PULL OUT your handy corporate mission statement, and readcarefully.   If you tally the pronouns and words like &quot;should&quot; and&quot;might,&quot; you'll have a reading of your company that goesbeyond the gussied-up talk of values, says a University ofMichigan study.   Profs. Priscilla Rogers and John Swales reviewed 80mission statements to determine how well-chosen words set themood. Statements that use mostly &quot;you&quot; have a&quot;laying-down-the-law&quot; flavor, and tend to use a lot of&quot;shoulds,&quot; notes Ms. Rogers. Those that use &quot;we&quot; have an&quot;inclusive&quot; tone, suggesting less distance between managementand employee.   For instance, Mellon Bank's mission statement uses phrasessuch as &quot;Your personal conduct should reflect the highestprofessional standards.&quot; Dana Corp., meanwhile, leans towardphrases such as &quot;We believe people respond to recognition.&quot;   Companies that sidestep the pronoun problem can sound&quot;institutional,&quot; Ms. Rogers says. Honeywell's &quot;Principles,&quot;for example, is a series of phrases such as &quot;Honeywellbelieves . . . .&quot;   Honeywell noticed the same thing. Two months ago, itintroduced a document heavy on the we words. That, says aspokesman, was &quot;very deliberate . . . to make the reader feelthat she or he is part of what is going on.&quot;   Of course, it's hard to know whether companies partial to&quot;we&quot; are more democratic or just have a way with words. EvenDana abruptly dropped the &quot;we&quot; for a sensitive subject: &quot;Itis highly desirable to outsource a portion of our productionneeds.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          ADVANCED Technology Laboratories in Bothell, Wash., gaveeach of 1,600 employees a thermal mug, reducingdisposable-cup trash 65%. But the company sent a sample to areporter in a foot-high box filled with plastic foam pods. .. . The good news, says consultant Towers Perrin: With thedemise of Section 89, a law that would have equalizedbenefits, employers can develop &quot;executive-only health plans&quot;free to top brass. The bad news? &quot;These plans arephilosophically difficult to justify&quot; when the rank-and-fileare shouldering more costs.</TEXT></DOC>
