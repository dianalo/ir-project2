Licio Gelli, a financier accused of masterminding a ring ofrightwing terrorism, subversion and spying, was among 34 peopleindicted on charges of complicity in fradulent bankruptcy.   The indictments also named Gelli's aide Umberto Ortolani, anItalian-born banker now living in Brazil, financier Anna BonomiBolchini, 23 board members and officials of the bank and eightother Italian businessmen. One woman was indicted for currencyviolations.   No truak date was announced.   The indictments stem from the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano,Italy's biggest private bank. It failed when it could not collect$1.3 billion in loans made to 10 dummy companies in Latin Americacontrolled by the Vatican Bank.   The Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute forReligious Works, was the largest shareholder in Banco Ambrosiano.It agreed in 1984 to pay $250 million as part of Banco Ambrosiano'sbankruptcy settlement but said the payment was not an admission ofresponsibility.   Italian courts ruled last year that a treaty between the Vaticanand Italy prevents the prosecution of the Vatican Bank, AmericanArchbishop Paul Marcinkus, and two other top officials of that bank.   De Benedetti, who failed last year in a highly publicizedattempt to take over the Belgian group Societe Generale DeBelgique, was notified in July 1987 that he was under investigationfor his sale of Banco Ambrosiano shares shortly before it wentbankrupt.   However, the magistrates said Friday there was no evidence ofany wrongdoing by De Benedetti, whose financial empire includes theOlivetti computer group and the Mondadori publishing house.   ``I always expressed my total serenity in this area because Ihad full knowledge of not only having always acted in the fullrespect of the law but also of having exercised my duties asadministrator with determination and transparency,'' De Benedettisaid Friday.   Gelli was the grandmaster of the P2 (Propaganda Due) MasonicLodge that investigators linked to crimes that included taxevasion, bribery and conspiracy to topple the government. He alsowas charged in connection with the 1980 bombing of the Bolognatrain station that killed 85 people and injured 200 but wasn'tbrought to trial.   He was extradited to Italy from Switzerland last year oncondition that he could be tried only on charges related to thecollapse of Banco Ambrosiano.</TEXT></DOC>
