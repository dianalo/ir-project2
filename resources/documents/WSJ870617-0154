Between 1980 and the first half of 1986, total U.S. exports to developing countries fell by $13 billion, whereas total U.S. exports to industrial countries rose by $8 billion. But it was not declining exports that accounted for most of our trade deficit; it was the surge in our non-oil imports. Over this 5 1/2-year period, such imports rose by $156 billion, three-quarters of the rise coming from other industrial countries.    Our growing deficit also derived from the failure of our exports to grow in line with total imports by the rest of the world. That failure stemmed from the unprecedented appreciation of the dollar against the currencies of our main industrial competitors, which raised the foreign-currency price of our exports.    But why has the deficit been so slow to respond to the dollar's decline since early 1985? Based on their detailed econometric study, W.L. Helkie and Peter Hooper of the Federal Reserve Board's staff give the following answer: &quot;{T}he delay can be attributed largely to normal lags in the response of trade prices and volumes to exchange rate changes. Moreover, the real net export deficit would have widened substantially further in the absence of the depreciation.&quot;    Prof. Henry N.
