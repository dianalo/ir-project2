Earlier, the Central Committee was urged to offer legalization tothe banned independent union movement if it declares itself part ofsocialism and refrains from opposing the government.   But the proposal presented to the committee by Prime MinisterMieczyslaw F. Rakowski had so many conditions it appeared unlikelythe union federation, banned since 1982, would accept it.   Rakowski said Solidarity also would have to observe a two-yearstrike moratorium and give up financial aid from the West amountingto millions of dollars.   The meeting of the 230-member committee began at 10 a.m. Tuesday.A commentator on state television said the debate proved ``long,sharp and very hot.''   State radio reported at 3 a.m. Wednesday (9 p.m. EST Tuesday)that the session just ended and the committee adopted stancesconcerning political and trade union pluralism. No immediate detailsof the resolutions passed were available.   The official PAP news agency said a package of proposals onreforming the party passed unanimously, and the leadership's standon trade union and political pluralism was approved by a majority.It did not elaborate.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other spokesmen for the unionmovement declined official comment on Rakowski's proposal and werenot immediately available for their reaction on the committee'sdecision.   But a Solidarity source in Warsaw said on condition of anonymitythat Rakowski's offer at first glance appeared unclear and theconditions he set ``unacceptable'' or even ``laughable.''   He cited specifically the requirement that Solidarity declareitself to be socialist and that it refrain from all strikes. He saidSolidarity must be able to function as a free trade union movement.   Walesa had demanded the authorities agree to recognize the labormovement before he talks with them on Poland's future. He warnedthat social moods were becoming explosive because of rising pricesand shortages in stores.   A strike demanding higher pay and legalization of Solidaritymeanwhile closed the 1,100-worker Pabianice Fabric Works in thecentral city of Lodz. The strike was confirmed by the SolidarityInformation Service in Warsaw and by PAP.   State news media noted that the deliberations were strained.Party secretary Leszek Miller was quoted as saying a``full-blooded'' verbal duel was going on between Rakowski andofficial unions chief Alfred Miodowicz. Both men are on the rulingPolitburo.   ``It was very hot,'' Miller told a TV interviewer.   The discussion marked a key moment for the party and Solidarityas communist leaders struggled to decide whether to risk repeatingthe experiment of 1980 that permitted the East bloc's first legal,independent union movement.   Rakowski addressed specific questions to Solidarity. He said theanswers would determine if the union could be seen as a partner,thereby ``opening the process of legalization,'' or as a ``politicalopponent with whom one has to carry constant political struggle.''   The questions included whether the union would ``see itself as anintegral part of socialism'' and whether it intends to act as atrade union or as a political movement or party.   He also asked what position Solidarity would have towardanti-communist Polish groups and whether it would be a ``foreignagent'' by continuing to accept money from the U.S. Congress andother foreign organizations.   ``I am putting all these problems in an unambiguous way because Iaim at avoiding any kind of ambiguity. The problems are too seriousto allow ambiguities,'' Rakowski said.   He said the legalization process should be preceded by signing ofa detailed ``social accord'' among trade unions, political partiesand various clubs and associations.   The agreement could include provisions detailing planned socialand economic reforms and establishing a ``civic body'' to settledisputes among the signatories, he said.   Rakowski said the economy would be the most important factor forPoland in the coming years.   ``It above all needs order and peace,'' he said. ``Even the bestadministration methods and solutions will not meet our hopes if the... economy becomes a field of political struggles.''   After a 16-month period of freedom for millions of Solidaritysupporters, the union was suspended in a 1981 martial-law crackdownand later banned.   But the results have proved disappointing for Poland's leaders.The economy has stagnated, foreign creditors have beenunsympathetic, and reforms have been hamstrung by the refusal ofmany workers to participate as long as Solidarity is illegal.   Zygmunt Czarzasty, a new party secretary, took the floor to beginthe second day of the debate and said he endorsed the Politburostand on union pluralism, backing allowing more than one legal union.   Such pluralism is a ``social necessity,'' Czarzasty said.   Bogdan Kolomyjski, the manager of the huge Katowice Steel Mill,warned that competing unions threaten ``anarchy and divided workcrews.''   Other speakers opposed allowing unions other than thegovernment-sponsored OPZZ alliance.   The U.S. government has granted Solidarity $1 million a year forthe last two years, but Polish authorities have held up spending ofhalf of this.   Total U.S. aid to Solidarity was estimated last year at $5million by The New York Times.   Solidarity does not deny getting foreign help. Walesa said hewould take money from the Kremlin if he could use it to defend tradeunion freedoms.</TEXT></DOC>
