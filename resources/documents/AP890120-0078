The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement the first roundof talks, which concluded today, were ``intensive andconstructive.'' The talks are to resume in the next for days, thestatement said.   Ministry spokesman Alon Liel told Israel radio an agreement wasemerging in which Israeli tourists would be allowed to visit Tabawithout a special permit or entry taxes if the 250-acre strip werereturned to Egyptian sovereignty.   Israel has controlled the tiny Red Sea resort since the 1967Middle East war, and an Israeli-owned, $41 million hotel complexthere has become a favorite winter vacation spot.   Egypt has demanded return of the land, and the dispute has been asore point between the nations for the past six years.   It began when Israel refused to hand over Taba in 1982 when itleft the Sinai peninsula under terms of the U.S.-brokeredIsraeli-Egypt peace treaty.   The issue went to international arbitration, and in September afive-member panel in Geneva awarded the border pillar closest to theresort to Egypt. But the tribunal said it had no power to decide thefinal border demarcation line.   The current talks are aimed at defining the border. If Egyptprevails, the hotel will be in its territory.   Other issues include entry procedures for Israelis and foreigntourists, and a plan for Egypt to purchase the hotel.   Israel has demanded that its citizens have reasonable access tothe site.   A six-member U.S. team, headed by State Department legal adviserAbraham Sofaer, has been mediating at the talks.   Nabil El Arabi, head of the Egyptian delegation, told reporterson Thursday, ``We would like Israeli tourists to come here, not onlyby the tens of thousands but by the tens and hundreds of thousands.''</TEXT></DOC>
