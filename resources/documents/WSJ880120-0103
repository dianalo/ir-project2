Shipment by the Central Intelligence Agency of previously purchased military goods had been suspended last week while Central American leaders met to assess regional efforts to reach peace. Congress ordered the suspension but gave President Reagan authority to resume shipments through Feb. 29 if a cease-fire wasn't in effect by yesterday.    Meanwhile, Contra leaders agreed to meet, possibly as soon as next week, with Sandinista officials to begin direct cease-fire talks. But the rebels still are pushing to broaden the agenda to include Nicaragua's political future.    At the meeting of Central American presidents in Costa Rica last weekend, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega agreed for the first time to meet directly with the rebels, suspend a state of emergency and declare an amnesty for political prisoners if a cease-fire can be arranged.    Yesterday, the Nicaraguan government said it formally lifted the state of emergency and disbanded its system of revolutionary &quot;people's courts,&quot; according to the Associated Press. Still, the White House lost no time in criticizing Mr. Ortega's latest moves as a tactic to derail Contra aid. &quot;We think it's important to keep . . . the resistance as a viable force to keep Ortega on track,&quot; Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said yesterday. He added that the administration hadn't yet decided how much aid to seek or whether the request would include both military and so-called nonlethal aid.    However, one official indicated that the administration, in an effort to win congressional support, might show some flexibility. He said, for example, that the White House might agree that it would suspend military aid if a cease-fire were achieved.    Some lawmakers who may hold the decisive votes on whether to provide aid to the Contras beyond the end of February called for a delay in a scheduled Feb. 3 House vote. They said Congress needs more time to evaluate whether Nicaragua's Sandinista government will make good on its pledges last weekend to take immediate steps to comply with a Central American peace plan. But House Democratic leaders insisted they wouldn't alter the schedule.    President Reagan, launching his campaign to win further aid for the Contras, told a group of administration officials yesterday: &quot;We must have the courage to stand behind those who continue to put their lives on the line for democracy in Nicaragua.&quot; And Rep. Rod Chandler (R., Wash.), a supporter of Contra aid, said the February vote &quot;could spell the difference between a possibly democratic Nicaragua and the whole region being enveloped in Marxism.&quot;    However, liberal Democrats warned that continued Contra aid would wreck the Central American peace plan. Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the House Intelligence committee, said that a vote for Contra aid was a vote to overthrow Nicaragua's government. He added, at a meeting with reporters, that if the object of U.S. policy was to moderate the Sandinistas' behavior, then fostering the peace process &quot;makes a lot of sense.&quot;    Next month's vote is expected to hinge on a group of 30 to 50 moderate and conservative Democrats who have, at various times, either supported or opposed aid, depending on the circumstances. Yesterday, some of these lawmakers were urging a postponement of the vote. &quot;The uncertainty of Contra aid has helped push Ortega to the position he's in,&quot; said Democratic Oklahoma Rep. Dave McCurdy. &quot;I'm not so sure we shouldn't keep him there a little while by prolonging the uncertainty.&quot;    But House Democratic leaders, believing that Mr. Ortega's promises strengthen their position against Contra aid, are unwilling to go along with any delay of the Feb. 3 showdown. &quot;There's no appetite to do that,&quot; a leadership aide said.    Congressional rejection of Mr. Reagan's request next month could mean the end of Contra aid. Previous requests have been subject to expedited procedures, but future requests would no longer be given such special treatment, and thus would be vulnerable to filibusters in the Senate and other legislative obstacles.    Under a previous agreement between Congress and the White House, though, the president could make another request for aid to the Nicaraguan rebels any time after July 1 if the February request is approved. And Congress would have to act on it by Sept. 30.    Under the proposal made by the Contras yesterday, two meetings would be held simultaneously. One would focus on the technical side of a cease-fire, and would include representatives of the Nicaraguan government, the rebels and foreign advisers to both sides. The other, treating proposed democratic reforms, would include the Contras, the civilian opposition and the Sandinistas.    ---   Michael Allen in Miami contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
