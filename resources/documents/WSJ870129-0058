Buying StocksIn One's Firm Demands an Objective Eye---By Roger LowensteinStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   Jim Barry, a financial planner in Boca Raton, Fla., tells a story about a client who retired from a well-known corporation. The client had $230,000 -- about 60% of his net worth -- invested in the company.    &quot;He said it was a great company,&quot; Mr. Barry recalls. &quot;They gave him a job when he got out of the service. He was a plant manager. That's all he did his whole life.&quot;    The &quot;great company&quot; was International Harvester Co., which was near bankruptcy. The client's holdings had already shrunk considerably in value. As the episode illustrates, &quot;there is an emotional problem to owning&quot; your own company's stock, Mr. Barry says. &quot;You become married to it.&quot;    While Wall Street is preoccupied with the furious trading that is setting volume and price records, people on Main Street often focus closer to home. For many Americans, the first -- and sometimes only -- stock they buy is that of the company they work for.    Buying stock in one's own company is often a good investment. Many companies offer discounts or matching contributions to employees, giving the purchaser a built-in advantage. Moreover, most employees don't speculate on or trade in and out of such stock. Thus, they are unlikely to get caught in the whipsaws of market timing or to run up commission charges.    But such an investment also contains large risks. People often put too much faith in their employer and pour most or all of their savings into company stock. In the worst case, a corporate failure could wipe out an employee's savings and job.    &quot;Very often I see people who have everything invested in their company,&quot; says Marilyn Capelli, a Chicago financial planner. &quot;I tell them that they're putting themselves at a great deal of risk.&quot;    The reasons people invest in their companies usually go beyond the simple belief that the stock will rise. Some cite the savings and convenience. Others, particularly in smaller companies, are wary of appearing unenthusiastic about the firm. And many think that -- even without technically possessing &quot;inside information&quot; -- they are better able to judge their company's prospects than the public.    Such judgments, however, may easily be distorted. Employees often mistake the prospects of their department for that of the entire company. Don Ziol, a manager of flatroll operations at LTV Corp.'s plant in East Chicago, Ind., has invested regularly in LTV stock. But Mr. Ziol, who says he works &quot;at a very efficient wing of the company,&quot; didn't forsee LTV's bankruptcy filing. His perspective, he concedes, &quot;might be a lot narrower than someone higher in management.&quot;    Managers are fallible, too. Burton Malkiel, dean of Yale's School of Organization and Management, says higher-ups may have a better feel for their company. But even then, he says, &quot;I'm suspicous of the view that they will be better investors. It may be the opposite: You work on a product and get blinded by it.&quot;    In fact, senior management may be especially subjective about companies in which they have an entrepreneurial stake. A client of Mr. Barry, the Boca Raton planner, had $1.3 million invested in Computer Products Inc. of Pompano Beach, Fla., a company he helped form. When the man resigned, he insisted that he &quot;knew the company,&quot; and refused to sell his investment. But Computer Products encountered problems, and the value of the client's stock fell to $200,000.    Sometimes employees invest and hold their stock out of sheer loyalty. A.T. Paioni, a branch manager at Bank of America, where he has worked since 1948, for years put 15% of his salary into the bank's stock. &quot;Last year was very difficult,&quot; he says. (The stock price fell 6% while the market in general rose.) While conceding that it makes sense to diversify, he says, &quot;I think I give this (stock) a different type of evaluation. This company has been my adult life.&quot;    Financial advisers warn that corporate loyalty shouldn't be a substitute for good judgment. &quot;The first question you have to ask is, 'Does it have investment merit?'&quot; says James W. Frevert, a broker and financial planner with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in West Palm Beach, Fla.    For many, employee programs to buy their company's stock have proved advantageous. Juan Yanes, an engineer and executive who retired from Exxon Corp. in 1985, says the oil firm represents 20% of his portfolio, and that based on past appreciation, &quot;it's the best stock I have.&quot; Richard Tyler has worked for FPL Group, a Florida utility, since 1950. Since the 1960s, he has been setting aside part of his salary for company stock -- the only securities he owns. He now has a nest egg for a comfortable retirement.    Many company plans are qualified, which means that employees have tax incentives to hold their stock until they retire. But in many such plans, employees can choose among company stock and other investments, such as equity funds and fixed-income funds. Thus, even in qualified plans, employees can often take advantage of corporate matching without being bound to the company stock.    At Bank of America, for example, only about 15% of employee contributions to the stock-purchase plan are invested in company stock. The rest is invested in bonds, diversified equities and money markets. At General Motors Corp., where salaried employees who participate in a savings plan must put at least 50% of that money in GM stock, only 55% of all savings is invested in the auto maker.    Companies generally encourage employee stock purchases as a means of fostering corporate spirit. But in some cases, ownership of a big block of stock can create conflicts for the rank and file.    At Eastern Airlines, union members acquired a large amount of stock in return for wage concessions. But their position as employees conflicted with their role as shareholders in a company struggling to cut wages. That battle helped spur Eastern's buyout by Texas Air Corp.    &quot;There is a real problem with employees, as opposed to managers, buying stock,&quot; says Pat Philbin, a 44-year-old Eastern pilot and attorney. The employee is &quot;at odds with himself. If he takes money out in wages, he may decrease the value of his stock.&quot;    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Computer Products Inc.&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 30, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
