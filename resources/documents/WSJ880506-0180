Speaking at an air show in Hanover, West Germany, Mr. Vogels said MBB, as the group is known, was aided by a 6.9% sales increase, to 6.2 billion marks ($3.7 billion) from 5.8 billion marks in 1986. He predicted that sales will rise to 7.5 billion marks in 1988 and to more than nine billion marks by 1990.    &quot;The results have improved considerably but aren't yet satisfactory,&quot; Mr. Vogels said. He noted that last year's results were burdened by a 150 million-mark capital increase at the Deutsche Airbus G.m.b.H. unit, the German partner in the Airbus Industrie consortium. MBB will write down to zero its investment in the loss-plagued aircraft maker, Mr. Vogel said. MBB also contributed 150 million marks to Airbus in 1986.    Besides MBB, which is owned by a group of companies and isn't publicly traded, the members of the Airbus consortium are British Aerospace PLC, Aerospatiale of France and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    Ministers from West Germany, Britain, France and Spain yesterday agreed on a plan to reform the consortium's management by the end of this year to boost efficiency and cut costs. The supervisory board will be reduced to five members from 17, the position of managing director will be strengthened and the post of finance director will be created. </TEXT></DOC>
