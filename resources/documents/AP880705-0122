The leaflets, both signed by the PLO-linked United NationalLeadership of the Uprising, sparked confusion among Palestinians.But it was not known if the contradictory orders signaled a riftamong leaders of the nearly 7-month-old rebellion.   Israeli troops, meanwhile, shot and wounded a 17-year-old Arabin the chest in the West Bank city of Nablus, officials of thecity's Al Ittihad Hospital said.   The army confirmed the casualty, and said the soldiers openedfire after Arab youths hurled rocks at them from a rooftop in theNablus marketplace.   Since the uprising began Dec. 8 against Israel's 21-yearoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 215 Palestinians andfour Israelis have been killed.   Also Tuesday, Arabs observed a PLO-ordered general strike thatshut down shops, halted public transportation and turned cities inthe occupied territories and Arab east Jerusalem into virtual ghosttowns.   Most of about 120,000 Palestinians who work in Israel alsostayed away from their jobs, Arab radio reports said.   Some Palestinians told The Associated Press the conflictingleaflets were aimed at plunging the Arab uprising into disarray bycreating confusion among Palestinians over which directive to obey.   They speculated that one of the leaflets was planted by Israelisecurity officials to spark dissension among Palestinians and givethe appearance that underground leaders were divided. But theydisagreed over which one was fake.   Army officials declined comment.   The Palestinians rejected the possibility that the leaflets werea sign of infighting among uprising leaders. Since the unrestbegan, Palestinians have repeatedly stressed that they are unitedbehind their leadership.   ``Someone is trying his best to make people start questioninghow many leaderships we have. The aim is to create problems,'' saidMahdi Abdul Hadi, the head of an east Jerusalem-based group ofPalestinian academics.   ``Who benefits from such problems? The Israelis. They can say`Look at those Palestinians disagreeing with each other. They don'tknow what they want until now,''' he said.   One leaflet called for a general strike Friday and anotherseven-day strike beginning Sunday, while the other ordered only atwo-day strike over the weekend.   One leaflet also addressed a rift between the PalestineLiberation Organization and more radical Palestinian factions overwhether to endorse peace negotiations with Israel.   The leaflet praised a statement by PLO deputy Abu Shariffadvocating negotiations and the creation of a Palestinian statealogside Israel. Shariff's statement has prompted sharp criticismfrom radical Palestinian leaders.   Arab journalist Daoud Kuttab said raising the Abu Shariffstatement was bound to create discord, no matter who issued theleaflets.   ``This is like a hot potato, so taking any position is a formulafor internal fighting,'' said Kuttab, who writes for thePalestinian daily A-Sinnara, which is published in Nazareth.   ``It would indicate a rift in the uprising leadership if theleaflet is genuine, but it means nothing if the Israelis forged it.My feeling is the aim was to create confusion,'' Kuttab said in aninterview.   Also Tuesday, the army blew up two homes in the biblical town ofBethlehem. The houses belonged to Arabs suspected of stagingfirebomb attacks, the military command said.   ``We shall reach ... any man who has thrown a firebomb in coldblood, intending to kill everyone here,'' Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir, aWest Bank commander, told Israel army radio.   Economics Minister Gad Yaakobi blamed the uprising for aneconomic slowdown in Israel, saying it had cost the same amount asthe country's real growth, or about 3 percent to 3.5 percent of thegross national product of $27 billion. The percentage equals about$900 million.   In May, Israeli officials said the uprising had cost Israelabout $560 million in lost tourist income, uncollected taxes andadded military expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
