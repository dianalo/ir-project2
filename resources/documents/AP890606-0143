Also Tuesday, Israeli troops fatally shot a 22-year-oldPalestinian and a 14-year-old Arab died of wounds received the daybefore.   Police fired tear gas in Jerusalem to scatter Arab crowds thatraised illegal Palestine Liberation Organization flags and shoutedslogans at a funeral for Omar Qassem, a PLO guerrilla leader whodied in prison.   Shamir spoke while touring the border near the Misgav Amcollective farm, where guerrillas attempted to infiltrate fromLebanon on Sunday.   An Israeli soldier and three guerrillas died in the shootout, thefourth in eight days on the frontier or in the Israeli-controlled``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.   ``We do not think the PLO has changed its path, its nature,''Shamir told soldiers. ``The American contacts only strengthen theirmotivation to continue in these acts.''   Israel has opposed the U.S.-PLO talks since they began inDecember after PLO leader Yasser Arafat recognized Israel's right toexist and renounced terrorism. The next round of meetings isscheduled to begin Thursday in Tunis, Tunisia.   Jamil Hafez Suleiman, 22, was fatally shot in the head in astone-throwing clash with Israeli troops in Beit Lahiya, Arabhospital officials said.   Salem Salim al-Atuna, 14, of nearby Nusseirat refugee camp diedafter being shot in the head in a confrontation with troops Monday,the officials said.   Throughout the occupied territories, army gunfire wounded eightPalestinians.   The army confirmed the two deaths and two wounded and said it wasinvestigating the other reports.   The deaths raised to 508 the number of Palestinians killed in the18-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank andGaza Strip. The unrest has killed 22 Israelis.   Israel on Tuesday began issuing new identification cards thatGazans will have to show to enter Israel. About 50,000 Gazans workin Israel.   Palestinians see it as a means of penalizing them for theuprising, but Israeli officials say it is to increase security.   About 2,000 Palestinians took part Tuesday in the three-hourprocession that carried Qassem's rough-hewn wooden coffin throughthe streets of Arab east Jerusalem.   Qassem, 48, died of kidney failure Sunday after serving more than20 years in prison for leading a commando raid across the JordanRiver in 1968.   He was a politburo member of the Damascus-based Democratic Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine and was Israel's longest servingPalestinian prisoner.   It was one of the largest pro-PLO demonstrations held in the Arabsector since the uprising began.   Small children, many with faces masked with Arab scarves, wavedoutlawed PLO flags. Other marchers shouted: ``With rifles we willcontinue the struggle against Israel!''   Helmeted riot police twice charged the marchers and fired teargas. Army radio said rubber bullets also were fired.   No injuries were reported, but Israel radio said 20 protesterswere detained.   Among the marchers were three Israeli-Arab legislators. One,Abdel Wahab Daraushe, told mourners: ``In spite of Israel'sarrogance, the intefadeh will be victorious.'' Intefadeh is Arabicfor uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
