(products).andO;Product:   ODMS (Search software) (design and construction).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionSoftware PackagesDocument Management Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Two of the hottest software categories going are workflow automation anddocument management.andP;  The two are often seen as separate entities, but, infact, organizations only begin to get real value from workflow automation anddocument management when they are combined.andM;The combination gives individual users a tool to navigate through a mass ofdocuments and files on a network, while allowing groups of users to automatebusiness procedures and processes that documents are designed to serve.andP;  It'sone thing for a user to be able to find and update an aborning request forproposal, but quite another to ensure that every employee responsible forcontributing to that document does so in a timely fashion.andM;An interesting approach to this problem is the Odesta Document ManagementSystem (ODMS) from Odesta Corporation of Northbrook, Illinois.andP;  Odesta hasquietly made a name for itself in Macintosh software.andP;  Recently, it beganapplying its core database and visual programming technology to a new set ofdocument and process management applications in DECnet networks withMacintosh client workstations.andP;  Digital Equipment Corporation is helping outwith this development and the marketing of ODMS.andM;WHAT IS ODMS? ODMS is a clientserver software system that provides two majorfunctions.andP;  First, it is a document-management system.andP;  That means it allowsusers to store their data as documents-forms, reports, letters, compounddocuments-as well as a famework for organizing those documents.andP;  Second, ODMSis a workflow management system.andP;  That means it provides tools to model andrecord procedures and processes, as well as a framework for executingpreviously recorded workflow sequences.andM;ODMS is built on Odesta's Helix relational DBMS (RDBMS) with extensions tosupport storage and retrieval of documents and images.andP;  Helix is deployed onthe server-either a VAX or a Macintosh.andP;  On the VAX, Helix is layered atopDigital's Rdb (RDBMS), using it as a storage manager.andP;  ODMS client software,also based on Helix, handles display chores and manages interaction with theserver via either DECnet or AppleTalk.andM;Layered atop ODMS's document management software is a set of visual workflowmanagement tools.andP;  Users model and record the steps in a process by arrangingicons on their displays and specifying their relationships.andP;  Readers familiarwith Odesta's Double Helix DBMS, with its visual programming &quot;files,&quot; willfind these tools extremely familiar.andM;DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT.andP;  In document management, the role of ODMS is to model asdata as documents that are stored in Digital's Rdb and to then manage them.andO;A document is data with extended attributes-its author, the date of itscreation, the application that created it, and so on.andP;  Users familiar withHewlett-Packard's NewWave will see a conceptual similarity in ODMS.andP;  Bothproducts model the world as objects; ODMS just happens to call those objectsdocuments.andM;The ODMS server, in effect, adds a data type to those normally supported byRdb.andP;  A document is a &quot;binary large object (BLOB),&quot; an extended byte stream.andO;Neither the ODMS server nor the data manager actually knows what's in thedocument.andP;  ODMS's role is to map documents into Rdb and retrieve them ondemand.andP;  Only the application creating the document needs to know itsstructure.andM;Internal vs.andP;  External BLOBS.andP;  Odesta had to add support for BLOB field typesto Helix to make ODMS work.andP;  ODMS stores and manages BLOBs internally, inconcert with Rdb.andP;  Basically, ODMS retrieves BLOBs from Rdb, locks therelevant Rdb record, and sends a copy of the record to the clientworkstation.andP;  The system allows an open number of documents to be stored in aparticular record.andP;  When the user finishes working with the document(s) inthe record, it is uploaded to ODMS, which updates the Rdb record.andM;Odesta's approach is important because it manages BLOBs within the structureof the database management system.andP;  So-called internal BLOBs are subject tothe DBMS's access control, security, and integrity features.andP;  Essentially, anexternal BLOB is a pointer contained in a relational field to an externaldata structure, while external BLOBs, which are more commonly implemented,place BLOBs outside of the DBMS.andP;  External BLOBs are not protected by theDBMS.andM;ODMS can work with any RDBMS that supports internal BLOBS.andP;  Today, this meansthe system works outside of SQL, the leading database query languagestandard.andP;  Odesta is committed to providing support for BLOBs within an SQLframework as the RDBMS vendors implement supports for BLOBs under SQL.andM;Management Applications.andP;  Riding atop ODMS's core database is a layer ofdocument management services.andP;  This software provides access controls, theability to manage different versions of the same document (includingrevision-tracking), and a relational document tree structure.andM;WORKFLOW AUTOMATION.andP;  The software on the ODMS client is an applicationsenvironment anchored by ODMS's ability to encapsulate files and theapplications that created them and Helix's visual programming tools.andM;Encapsulation.andP;  Again, the comparison to NewWave is useful to understandingthe base concept.andP;  ODMS captures a number of attributes for each document itmanages, and one of those attributes is a reference to the application thatcreated the document.andP;  Thus, when the user retrieves a document, it is loadedinto the proper editor for viewing.andM;However, ODMS takes this concept further than does NewWave alone.andP;  NewWave isprimarily concerned with registering and managing objects in a uniformenvironment.andP;  ODMS accomplishes those goals but also allows users to captureas attributes the things that happen in the life of a document.andP;  For example,if a document requires the approval of a particular manager, that fact can becaptured as an attribute.andM;Workflow Design.andP;  The supporting database and encapsulation technology ofODMS is important, but its application-building tools will be of greatestsignificance to users.andP;  ODMS very effectively approaches the problem of usersmodeling group processes and procedures without having to learn an arcaneprogramming language.andM;In ODMS, users model processes by placing icons representing the participantsand steps in a process in the proper relationships.andP;  The tools are descendedfrom Double Helix's visual facility for building database programs.andP;  ForODMS, Odesta added several statements to the Double Helix base, such as,among others, Picture, which displays a bit-mapped image.andM;If an icons-and-arrows representation of a process is too limiting for users,they can also obtain a textual list of the steps in a process.andP;  Included inthis facility is a hypertext feature that allows a user to view a procedurefrom a very general level and obtain more detail about particular steps justby focusing on those steps.andM;Odesta provides customizable templates with ODMS to get users started ondescribing processes.andM;WHY DIGITAL? Digital and Odesta have been collaborating on software for sometime, although Digital only recently made Odesta's ODMS a centerpiece of itscorporate electronic publishing marketing program.andP;  In selecting the VAX asits first non-Macintosh platform, Odesta sought to take advantage ofDigital's Network Application Support (NAS) cross-application services.andP;  Thecompound document capabilities within ODMS are obtained from Digital'sCompound Document Architecture (CDA), a central component of NAS.andM;The most notable feature CDA provides is hot links, which are called LiveLinks in CDA parlance.andP;  A hot link ties the representation of an object in acompound document back to its source, ensuring that changes to one will bereflected in the other.andM;CONCLUSION.andP;  ODMS is interesting both as a product and as an approach to thegeneral issue of document management.andP;  From a product perspective, it hasapplicability to Macintosh and DECnet networks.andP;  This is aimed at a distinctmarket, but doesn't cover everyone.andP;  ODMS can access DB2 data via Digital'sSNA gateway, but it would be preferable to have an ODMS version for DB2.andM;As an approach to document management, ODMS is interesting because it iscomprehensive.andP;  It attacks the problem of document management in severaldimensions.andP;  Today, a variety of products seek to solve the documentmanagement problem on a variety of platforms-Fileshare from Saros, Magellanfrom Lotus, On Location from On Technology-help in finding, managing, andnavigating through masses of information.andP;  Others, like ATandamp;T's new Rhapsodyprogram, Workhorse (upon which Rhapsody is based), and Staffware, help tocapture business processes and procedures so they may be aided by computers.andM;Each one of these products attacks one part of the whole problem, and, eventhen, there are gaps.andP;  ATandamp;T's Rhapsody, for example, does not yet provide aneffective means for users to model processes.andP;  It leaves the &quot;procedureprogramming&quot; to administrators.andM;ODMS is also an illustration of how vendors can cooperate to build advancedsoftware.andP;  Odesta's Helix technology is highly advanced, being relational innature while supporting features like event triggers, stored procedures,user-defined data types, constrained datafiles, and BLOBs support, albeitoutside of the SQL standard.andP;  Rather than fight SQL, Odesta has found anapplication need its core technology can partially satisfy.andP;  We say&quot;partially&quot; because ODMS relies on Digital's NAS services for basic platformcapabilities.andP;  Both vendors gain from the partnership.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
