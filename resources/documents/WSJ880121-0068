Fourth-quarter net income was $172.5 million, or $1.32 a share, compared with a net loss of $228 million for the year-earlier period. Year-earlier results include a charge of $593 million, reflecting the sale, paring or termination of operations plus severance costs. Excluding year-ago revamping items, net would have risen 45% from $119 million, or 91 cents a share.    Sales for the quarter rose 7.6% to $4.74 billion from $4.40 billion.    Robert F. Daniell, chairman and chief executive officer, said the latest results reflect the expected &quot;sustainable progress&quot; from the restructuring.    United's shares closed at $34.50, down 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Quarterly sales grew in flight systems, which includes Sikorsky helicopters, and defense electronics and aircraft products lines; building systems, primarily Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioning systems; and industrial products, such as automotive products, Essex wire and cable, and control systems.    Sales slipped less than 1%, however, in the segment that includes the Pratt andamp; Whitney engine lines. Market share at Pratt has dropped because of competition, and the unit said in November it planned layoffs this year.    In an interview, Mr. Daniell said he expects the Army to repropose the so-called LHX helicopter program but only for light attack support helicopters. The original $50 billion proposal, which the Army canceled for budgetary reasons, called for a scout/attack copter as well as one for utility, or general, use. United's Sikorsky division again would bid on such a revamped project in partnership with Boeing Co., the executive said.    Sikorsky continues to build Black Hawk copters under an authorization from about 10 years ago, Mr. Daniell said. This job had called for about 1,100 Black Hawks, but the company currently estimates it may build as many as 1,700, he said.    Mr. Daniell has been paring businesses and employees, and currently is negotiating with a number of parties to sell the Essex wire unit, for which the company sought bids beginning last June. Analysts have said the unit doesn't fit with the rest of United's business. This month, United also agreed to sell two financing units for $334 million. </TEXT></DOC>
