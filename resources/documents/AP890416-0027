Cheney, who took over as defense chief just a month ago, beginstalks Wednesday with other defense ministers of the 16-nation NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization to review their nuclear posture.   The two-day meeting of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group will focusnew attention on modernizing battlefield nuclear arms, apotentially divisive issue for the allies at a time of warmer tieswith the Soviet Union.   Diplomats said no key decisions were expected at the talks,although the United States would like the allies to signal theirstrong commitment to a modernization program.   Germany, Belgium and some other European nations want topostpone for several years the politically sensitive decisions ofproduction and deployment of a new generation of short-range,surface-to-surface missiles.   Those countries also would like the alliance to show awillingness to negotiate reductions in those weapons with theSoviet-led Warsaw Pact, a position the United States opposes.Warsaw Pact foreign ministers recently made a new pitch for earlyarms talks on those weapons.   Cheney has indicated flexibility on the modernization issue.   ``I think the timing is open to question,'' he recently toldreporters. ``I don't think it has to be done immediately.''   He said, however, that the United States wants the allies at aMay 29-30 summit of NATO leaders to ``adopt a clear-cut positionthat indicates that we, in fact, are going to maintain thehigh-quality nuclear forces in Europe.''   He said in a later interview that the United States opposesEast-West negotiations on those arms. ``We do not believe at thispoint it would be appropriate to embark on yet another round ofarms control talks that would result in eliminating thoseshort-range forces,'' he said.   ``The Soviets have always tried to de-nuclearize Europe, that'sbeen a major objective of theirs,'' he said. ``We've alwaysresisted it.''   At the heart of the modernization debate is a plan, pressed bythe United States and Britain, to upgrade the Lancesurface-to-surface missile. Military analysts say the Lance,introduced in 1972, will become obsolete in 1995.   The missile has a range of a little more 60 miles. The new onewould travel more than 250 miles, just under the limits of theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. The accord eliminatesU.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of about 300 to3,400 miles.   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's top military commander in Europe,has drafted a report for NATO officials arguing that replacing theaging Lance will enable the West to make sharp cuts in nuclearartillery.   The United States wants a commitment from the allies before iturges Congress to approve money to produce the new missile.Congress is to consider this year a request for funds to develop amodel for test purposes. But resistance in Germany, where most ofthe weapons would be based, has raised questions about what kind ofsignal the United States will get this spring.   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he wants to delay a decisionon production of the new missile until 1991 or 1992 _ afterimportant elections next year in Germany.   A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:``We're not to a point in the development where the alliance needsor it is even possible to make production or deploymentdecisions.'' The alliance, he said, never planned to make those keydecisions before 1991 or 1992.   A European diplomat, who also demanded anonymity, said some NATOnations worry the modernization program would amount to developmentof a new category of nuclear arms, with a vastly longer range.   They are concerned, he said, that such a development wouldcreate the impression the allies are trying to get around theaccord eliminating medium-range nuclear arms. ``We want to see asituation where reliance on nuclear weapons is decreasing,'' hesaid.   The West contends it maintains a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent,countering the huge superiority the East has built up inconventional weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
