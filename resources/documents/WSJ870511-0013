Godbold Jr., president and chief executive officer.    That would be little changed from the year-earlier $3.1 million, or 25 cents a share.    For all of fiscal 1987, Mr. Godbold said Zero had profit of $11.6 million, or 93 cents a share, on sales of $125.7 million. In fiscal 1986, profit totaled $12.8 million, or $1.03 a share, on sales of $123.3 million, restated to reflect discontinued operations.    However, Mr. Godbold said the Los Angeles-based maker of enclosures and cooling equipment for the electronics market &quot;doesn't find unreasonable&quot; analysts' estimates that Zero will post a 15% to 20% gain in profit for fiscal 1988. He added that the company's goal is for a 15% profit increase from fiscal 1987.    The executive said in an interview that demand has strengthened markedly in recent months after more than a year of &quot;dreary&quot; activity in Zero's electronics-based businesses.    He said the company's backlog totaled about $42.5 million at March 31, a 12% increase from the year-earlier. company was booking $1.08 in new orders for every $1 of business for which it billed a reversal from the 93 cents of new business booked for each $1 billed in the previous quarter.    Mr. Godbold said the company's focus now is on acquisitions. He said separate businesses ranging from $20 million to $45 million in annual sales are being considered, and product lines of about $5 million to $10 million in annual sales are also being looked at.    Mr. Godbold said Zero is considering businesses both in and out of the electronics business. </TEXT></DOC>
