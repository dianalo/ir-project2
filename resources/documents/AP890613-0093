But he also called on individuals to help end the illegal tradein rhinoceros horns.   ``We will certainly do at the government level what we canbecause this is a very serious question,'' Caithness said at thelaunch of an appeal fund for the charity Rhino Rescue. ``Agovernment can only do a certain amount. People pressure, ratherthan government pressure, is the solution.''   Caithness gave no specific examples of what the government woulddo.   The black rhino is threatened because poachers can sell a singlehorn for as much as $25,000.   The horns are used as traditional medicines and aphrodisiacs inAsia and as ceremonial dagger handles in the Middle East.   Only about 4,000 black rhinos remain in Africa, compared with anestimated 65,000 in 1970.</TEXT></DOC>
