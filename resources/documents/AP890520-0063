In the most violent confrontation since pro-democracydemonstrations began nearly five weeks ago, students said about 150armed police attacked students with electric cattle prods on a roadin western Beijing.   Zhu Bin, a student at the Beijing No. 2 Languages Institute,said the students were blocking 20 military troop trucks fromadvancing down the road when police appeared.   ``They attacked the girls first. We tried to protect them andthey hit us too,'' he said. Zhu, showing bruises on his shoulder,said 45 were hospitalized.   ``Down with martial law!'' became the new rallying cry asstudents called for the resignation of Li. Supporters of thestudents arrived by bicycle, in the back of flatbed trucks and onfoot.   Later today, 3,000 students on the square who had been on ahunger strike, some for as long as a week, decided to abandon theirfast to conserve their strength for the struggle ahead, studentleaders said.   Army troops moved into the capital late Friday and early todaybut were stopped by thousands of citizens who clogged the roads,climbed over their trucks and pleaded with them not to attack.   ``We are people and you are people! Why do you have nofeelings?'' one demonstrator shouted at the troopers.   Military helicopters made repeated low runs over the city, arare sight in this city of 10 million residents.   Three tanks just south of the square were being blocked by busesdeliberately placed across the road today by protesters.   As the day drew to a close, hundreds of thousands of peopleremained in control of central Beijing and few soldiers were seen.   Protests also have been reported in at least 20 other cities,including Shanghai, China's largest city with 12 million residents.   In Shanghai, more than 300,000 people rallied on the waterfrontof the Huangpu River and another 200,000 gathered in the city'sPeople's Square. Many carried banners demanding Li's resignation,but the police presence was minimal, and there were no reports ofviolence.   ``You've got millions of soldiers _ we've got 1.1 billionpeople,'' read one banner.   The Bush administration late Friday urged China to use restraintin dealing with the demonstrators and called a governmentannouncment of a news blackout ``disturbing.''   Britain today expressed concern at China's imposition of martiallaw in Beijing and urged the Chinese government and demostrators toexercise ``restraint and moderation.''   The Netherlands canceled a May 24-30 visit to China by QueenBeatrix. Critics of the planned visit had warned her safety couldnot be ensured and said the trip would be seen as a token ofsupport for China's rulers.   Martial law took effect this morning in eight districts of thecapital, China Central Television said.   The zone included Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center ofChina, where hundreds of thousands of protesters have been encampedthe past week.   ``Tiananmen is supposed to be under martial law, but it's understudent law,'' said a woman enrolled at Northern CommunicationCollege.   The regulations included strict limits on the activities offoreign reporters and photographers covering the protests, and U.S.television networks were ordered to halt transmissions fromBeijing. Normal transmission wires of The Associated Press were cutfor several hours this morning.   The crisis over China's most serious popular unrest in 40 yearsof communist rule also led to the resignation of Communist PartyGeneral Secretary Zhao Ziyang, a reformer who pushed for compromisewith the students, Chinese sources said.   One Asian diplomat said it appeared likely that Qiao Shi, amember of the power-wielding Politburo Standing Committee with abackground in public security, would be named to succeed Zhao.   Li announced the crackdown in a meeting at the Great Hall of thePeople.   It was the first time martial law was declared in Beijing sincecommunist China was founded in 1949.   Beijing becomes the second city under martial law. Lhasa,capital of Tibet, has been under martial law since March afteranti-Chinese riots.   Beijing university students began protesting for democracy onApril 15, after former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang died. Huwas ousted in 1987 for failing to crack down on earlier studentdmonstrations.   Although students have been the catalyst for the protests, theyhave evolved into broad-based demonstrations.   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li signed the martial laworder to end ``serious turmoil ... (that) destroyed people's lifeand social order.''   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong signed measures forbidding marches,strikes, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets, spreadingrumors, attacks on leaders and media outlets and ``any otherdestructive actions.''   In a separate order, he said foreign reporters were forbidden to``incite or instigate Chinese to to march'' and could not conductinterviews or make videos on the streets or at government offices,schools, factories and mines.   Li also said a ``very few people ... concentrate their attack oncomrade Deng Xiaoping, who has made great contributions to China'sopening to the outside world.''   Deng, 84, is widely admired for initiating market-orientedreforms but has come under sharp attack by students for holding onto power too long and letting political reform lag behind economicreforms.</TEXT></DOC>
