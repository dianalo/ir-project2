They are fired, booted out, cashiered, sacked, dismissed. But in the world of corporate communications, blunt, nasty things like these often don't happen. Nicer things happen.    For example, those who've lost jobs with ATandamp;T Technologies Inc. will be cheered to learn that they have participated in what the company calls &quot;involuntary separation.&quot;    And Sun Oil Co. definitely didn't shuck 40 employees a while back. A spokesman says Sun was only &quot;managing our staff resources. Sometimes you manage them up and sometimes you manage them down.&quot;    Perhaps nothing says more about the depth of corporate America's fear and loathing of failures than the way in which it treats bad news. Although securities laws require that publicly held companies reveal material developments, they still have much latitude in how they play the bad news. And they take all that leeway and more, rarely admitting in so many words that they've laid an egg.    So companies, for instance, do not pursue foolhardy strategies, suffer product flops or lose their shirts. Instead, they restructure to capitalize fully on changing market conditions, alter marketing plans and introduce improved versions.    In some instances, what looks, feels and smells like bad news is transformed through creative prose, into something that actually seems positive. For example, Herbalife International Inc. recently agreed to pay $850,000 to settle charges by authorities that it made false claims in promoting its nutritional and weight-loss products, and agreed to change some of the claims. An embarrassment? Not to President Mark Hughes, who said the following in a press release:    &quot;Today represents a milestone for Herbalife -- a solid foundation that is built on the confidence given to us today by statements issued by state and federal regulatory agenices. I am pleased to announce that, after more than a year and a half of discussions and negotiations with the food and Drug Administration, the California State Attorney General and the Califonria Department of Health, all three agencies have independently determined that Herbalife products have been and still are safe for the American public. Furthermore, all of our product claims, labeling and marketing materials are now in conformance with the spirit and the letter of both federal and state law.&quot;    Herbalife's marketing director, Jack Lund, defends the release. Because the settlement ended a two-year ordeal, he reasons, &quot;there could be nothing other than great happiness and relief.&quot;    More frequently, a company may attempt to take the edge off bad news by downplaying its importance or attributing it to innocent error. First National Bank of Boston made a valiant stab at this last year, and fell on its sword.    The bank pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of &quot;knowingly and willfully&quot; failing to report certain cash transfers as required by law and paid a $500,000 fine. Ducking and dodging the attendant bad publicity, it offered, among other excuses, the notion that the reporting failure had been due to a &quot;system failure,&quot; a mere &quot;internal glitch.&quot; This was like trying to conceal an elephant under a napkin; the total amount involved was $1.22 billion, which had been moved in 1,163 transactions.    Public relations practitioners who work for companies decry tactics of evasion or sugarcoating. &quot;What communications has to do is avert panic,&quot; says Gershon Kekst, who runs a New York PR firm bearing his name. &quot;It means present the facts in as forthright, timely and complete a way as possible. Any time you sugarcoat it, you're going to get indigestion.&quot;    But let us now peruse a press release from Mr. Kekst's shop. &quot;To further enhance its inherent value,&quot; this five-page epistle begins, &quot;Graphic Scanning Corp. has undertaken a series of transactions which consolidate its radio paging business around core markets, thereby increasing the market strength and cash flow of this business segment.&quot; Sounds good -- until we discover, deep in page three, that Graphic posted a whopping $49.9 million net loss for fiscal 1986.    Kekst's Robert Siegfried, who wrote the release, points out that Graphics has new management and that the poor results are due to the old management. &quot;It wasn't (trying) to bury the number,&quot; he says.    Faced with announcing downbeat news, companies may also retreat behind a screen of euphemisms rather than bluntly admit that they've fouled up. Many of these terms (including the aforementioned euphemisms for layoffs and dismissals) are enshrined in the Quarterly Review of Doublespeak, published by the National Council of Teachers of English.    &quot;We're swimming in this stuff,&quot; says Bill Lutz, an associate professor at Rutgers University and the quarterly's editor. &quot;People think this is careless use of language, but it isn't. It's very difficult to think this stuff up.&quot;    During the near-disaster at Three Mile Island, to cite one case, public relations scribes described fire as &quot;rapid oxidation&quot; and explosion as &quot;energetic disassembly.&quot; The damaged reactor core, they told worrywarts, was emitting no more heat than &quot;17 home toasters.&quot; For this work, they won the English teachers' Doublespeak Award.    More recently, Coca-Cola Co. twisted itself into knots to avoid depicting the replacement of old Coke with new as what it was -- an industrial-strength flop that forced the company to reincarnate its old potion under a new name, Coca-Cola Classic. In the company's terms, all that happened was that New Coke, instead of being a &quot;flagship brand,&quot; became a &quot;fighting brand&quot; within a &quot;megabrand,&quot; possessor of attributes that are a &quot;strategic plank&quot; in Coke's total marketing scheme.    Carlton Curtis, assistant vice president and head of corporate communications for Coca-Cola, says new Coke is a viable product but admits that the idea of replacing old coke with it was &quot;a failure.&quot; Nothing similar to these words appears in the company's annual report, however; the closest anyone comes is the statement that consumers &quot;demonstrated unexpectedly strong loyalty&quot; to the old brand.    Such shilly-shallying wins brickbats from Detroit PR man Sid Cato, who publishes a newsletter reviewing annual reports. Penril Corp., his choice for the worst 1985 report, heralds a 13% revenue increase in the second paragraph of its shareholder letter, but waits until page 19 to reveal that profit fell 98%.    &quot;Companies want somebody who can write a snow job,&quot; Mr. Cato declares. One tipoff: &quot;When I see no financial highlights on page one and no reference to the numbers in the letter to shareholders, I see a snow job aborning.&quot;    Douglas Mueller, president of the Gunning-Mueller Clear Writing Institute in Santa Barbara, Calif. knows more than most about the corporate aversion to facing up to problems in print. &quot;A simple message can be tortured until it almost obscures the meaning,&quot; says Mr. Mueller. He occasionally wonders why some clients bother to hire him. One once told him, &quot;But Mr. Mueller -- sometimes we don't want to communicate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
