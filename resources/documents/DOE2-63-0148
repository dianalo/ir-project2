This work utilizes three differentvibrational spectroscopic methods to study surface chemistry on bothsingle crystal and supported metal catalyst surfaces. These methods are:(1) Reflection IR Spectroscopy, (2) Transmission IR Spectroscopy, and(3) High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS). Currentactivities include the construction of a novel FT Reflection IR Instrumentwith rapid background acquisition and subtraction procedures. Transmissionir studies on the behavior of absorbed hydrocarbon species are underwayin a unique high temperature-low temperature cell. Here, an unusual labilityof C-H bonds from butadiene-derived species on Rh has been observed spectroscopically.HREELS studies of model oxide-supported metal catalysts have been initiatedand promise to give unique information about the nature of metal-supportinteractions.</TEXT></DOC>
