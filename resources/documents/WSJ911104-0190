In addition, the new rules allowinvestors to buy existing, troubled companies if theacquisition would save jobs. And they let investors financetheir investment with borrowing, so long as the assets of thebusiness aren't used as collateral.</LP><TEXT>   The rules for investor immigrants and other provisions ofthe Immigration Act of 1990 are still being reviewed by theOffice of Management and Budget, which is expected to be thelast step in the drafting process. The new immigration law,which shifts the emphasis of selecting immigrants more onwhat they can contribute to the economy, took effect lastmonth.   The Wall Street Journal acquired a copy of the regulationsfor immigrant visas, which allow foreigners to livepermanently in the U.S. The most extensive changes in theregulations for immigrant visas were in the investor visaportion of the rules.   Previous drafts of the rules &quot;were investor-friendly tobegin with,&quot; said Stephen Yale-Loehr, co-editor of theimmigration newsletter, Interpreter Releases. &quot;The new rulesare even more investor-friendly.&quot;   Although the law took effect Oct. 1, immigration attorneyssay the delay in issuing final regulations has slowedapplications under many aspects of the law. Moreover,applications can't be processed until final regulations takeeffect.   Immigration lawyers and U.S. business people hope the newregulations will invigorate a program that so far has failedto come up to expectations. Although applications under theinvestor visa program have been accepted since January, theImmigration and Naturalization Service has received onlyabout 100. Potential investors have been taking await-and-see posture because they were uncertain what thefinal regulations were going to be, said Theodore Ruthizer oflaw firm Winston andamp; Strawn in New York. Until now, it has been&quot;too uncertain, speculative,&quot; he said.   &quot;People have been holding their breath waiting for theshoe to drop,&quot; says Paul Donnelly, a Washington-basedconsultant. &quot;Within six months, we may be seeing asubstantial flow of foreign investment.&quot;   The investor provision, the first since 1977, is thiscountry's bid to enter the competition for flight capitalinto industrialized countries. Canada and Australia have longhad such programs for investors, with lower investment andjob requirements.   The provision sets aside 10,000 green cards, or permanentresidence visas, for investors (and their spouses andchildren). It calls for each foreigner to invest at least $1million, while creating at least 10 jobs for U.S. workers.   But the new regulations liberally interpret parts of thisprovision. The foreign entrepreneur can join others informing a larger venture rather than set up a soleproprietorship. The investor can buy a troubled company, aslong the number of workers are maintained. In addition toinvesting in start-ups, the investor can expand a viablecompany.   The regulations don't require a net infusion of capitalinto the U.S. In other words, a foreign investor can usecapital he or she already has in the country, whether it'sdeposited in a bank, in the stock market or in anotherventure.   Among the most significant rules is the one allowing thelower, $500,000 investment in rural or high-unemploymentareas. Previous draft regulations kept the minimum to $1million because of the difficulty in determininghigh-unemployment areas. Under the new regulations, a stateagency may designate a high-unemployment area even if it ispart of a city or town that overall may not have thatproblem.   But immigration officials rejected the suggestion thatgiving work to independent contractors be considered jobcreation. As a result, an investor financing the building ofa skyscraper won't be able to count employment ofconstruction workers as fulfilling the job creation criteria.</TEXT></DOC>
