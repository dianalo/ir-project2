De la Madrid, at a luncheon with Reagan, complained thatMexico's efforts to curb drug production and trafficking ``arestill not appreciated to their full extent'' and are the target of``disinformation.''   He said it was unlikely that any country devoted as muchresources to the fight as Mexico.   In a pointed reference to the United States, de la Madrid saidthe battle against drugs cannot be won unless drug consumption isattacked with the same vigor as the fight against production andtrafficking.   Although about 25 percent of the Mexican army is engaged in theantidrug campaign, the United States says the effort is not enough,is hampered by official corruption and that the flow of drugs isincreasing.   Reagan, in his luncheon remarks, said, ``The people in theUnited States are now turning away from drugs'' and thatdevelopment ``should curb the demand that fuels the trafficking.''   The two leaders held private talks in a seaside hotel inMazatlan, which is in the state of Sinaloa, the main center forMexico's illegal drug trade. Following the four-hour meeting,Reagan was flying to California for a four-night stay at his SantaBarbara ranch.   The leaders conferred privately for 45 minutes with onlynotetakers present. Reagan told de la Madrid that Mexico has beenvery cooperative in fighting drugs but urged him to work harder.   ``This is the year we have to show results,'' Reagan told theMexican leader, according to a White House statement.   Reagan pronounced himself ``extremely pleased with ourdiscussions and the remarkable record of achievements'' of theirtalks.   As they posed for pictures, Reagan was asked if he agreed withde la Madrid that drug use was the root of the whole problem. ``Italways has been,'' Reagan replied.''   Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-Americanaffairs, told reporters on Air Force One there was ``a seriouspossibility'' the United States would find that Mexico shouldremain eligible for aid from international financial institutionseven though its drug program falls somewhat short.   A firm opponent Reagan's campaign to fund the Contra rebels inNicaragua, de la Madrid called for negotiated settlements inCentral America ``that take into account the legitimate andessential interests of the parties in conflict, with a sense offairness and even-handedness.''   He said peace would be possible only if all the governments ofCentral America ``comply with the commitments that they have madeat the highest level.''   For his part, Reagan said ``our commitment to democracy in ourhemisphere must be unshakeable.''   He said totalitarian systems in the Soviet Union, Cuba andNicaragua ``have demonstrated for all to see that tyranny doesn'twork. Mexico and the United States have a common interest instable, free and democratic governments in this hemisphere.''   He expressed hopes for a common U.S.-Mexican stand ``against theexpansion of totalitarianism.''   The White House statement said Reagan, in his private talks,underscored his support for the Contras and ``repeated hiscommitment to the peace process.'' It quoted de la Madrid as sayingMexico is supportive of the four-nation peace accord signed inGuatemala.   Later, at a briefing for reporters, Secretary of State GeorgeShultz said that while differences over Central America werediscussed, ``there were no heated words.'' Asked whether the twosides had come closer on the subject, he said, ``that was not aparticular focus'' of the talks.   Asked if Mexico should do more to combat drugs, Shultz said,``Yes, and so does the United States. So do we all. It's atremendous problem.''   In his luncheon remarks, de la Madrid said Mexico's huge foreigndebt _ $105 billion _ ``continues to be one of the major obstaclesto development in my country.''   He said ``there is an urgent need ... to find new formulas toadjust debt servicing to the capacity of debtor countries to payand to permit them to boost growth and recover their livingstandards, which have been so greately affected by this longcrisis.''   Reagan said there is ``reason for optimism'' on the debtproblem. He said Mexico's plan to exchange some of its debt forspecial bonds which are backed by U.S. zero coupon bonds was aninnovative idea.   Reagan got a red-carpet welcome and a 21-gun salute as hestepped off Air Force One.   In his welcoming remarks, de la Madrid said, ``Today, we affirmthat our relations are conducted on a very positive level.''   He said their summit _ the sixth and final meeting of the twooutgoing presidents _ would ``strengthen the basis for good andproductive relations'' and be a forum for discussing problems ``asfrankly as we always have.''   Reagan cited U.S.-Mexican steps on trade, economic problems andlaw enforcement and said, ``We can be proud of what has beenaccomplished in so short a period.''   He said their meeting paved the way for ``a new generation ofpolitical leaders in both our countries who will soon follow us andbuild on the foundation we've laid.   ``That foundation is cemented by our shared values and commongoals _ a better quality of life for our peoples, opportunties forour children and the dignity of living peacefully in free anddemocratic societies,'' Reagan said.   He said much remains to be done ``but we can be proud of thelegacy we leave.''   While the two leaders met, senior officials from both countriesheld talks of their own, focusing on foreign policy trade, drugsand law enforcement.   Reagan was accompanied by Shultz, Treasury Secretary James A.Baker III, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, and TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter.   One agreement was signed, allowing more Mexican textile andapparel exports into the United States.   The agreement, already in the process of being implemented,gives Mexico, the sixth largest supplier of textiles to the UnitedStates, an automatic 6 percent increase in exports to that richmarket in the next four years.   Although minor in scope, the pact symbolizes the cooperationbetween the two countries as Mexico seeks to increase its exportsand at the same time open its own market to more U.S. products byreducing tariffs.   Another accord, dealing with telecommunications, had beenexpected to be signed, but was pulled back because of a``last-minute minor screw up,'' said Abrams. He said he expected itwould be signed in a few days.   Reagan also devoted his weekly radio address to the summit.   While avoiding direct criticism of Mexico's support of theleftist government of Nicaragua, Reagan said the establishment ofSoviet- and Cuban-backed totalitarian regimes is ``a threat tostability and freedom.   ``Nowhere is that threat more acute than in Central America,''Reagan said. ``I would hope that the United States and Mexico willfind common interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat.''   The summit falls just two weeks before Reagan must ertifywhether drug trafficking nations such as Mexico have made adequateprogress attacking the problem.   For nations that fail to win certification, the United States isrequired by law to vote against proposed loans in the World Bank,International Monetary Fund and other international financialinstitutions.</TEXT></DOC>
