Lone Star states that its facilities proposed to be abandoned (See Appendix)from interstate commerce will subsequently be used by Lone Star Gas Companyon an intrastate basis, subject to later partial abandonment from serviceof certain portions of Lone Star's present Texas intrastate facilities.Lone Star further states that no sales of gas dedicated to interstate commerceunder the Natural Gas Act are made into the facilities proposed to be abandonedfrom interstate commerce, and that the only construction which will benecessary to implement the proposed realignment will be the relocationof the two metering facilities, which will be performed pursuant to a requestunder the Blanket Authorization to be filed after the issuance of the requestedabandonment authorization. Lone Star states that upon issuance by the Commission of the requestedauthorization, the gas produced from the Texas sources will be totallyconsumed by customers of Lone Star Gas Company in Texas and customers ofLone Star Gas Company in Oklahoma will be served with gas from Oklahoma.It is stated that a portion of Lone Star's interstate Oklahoma gas willbe transported to Lone Star's customers in Southwest Oklahoma by Lone StarGas Company (intrastate) pursuant to NGPA section 311(a)(2) authorization.In addition, Lone Star's interstate Oklahoma gas may be transported byLone Star Gas Company (intrastate) pursuant to NGPA section 311(a)(2) fordelivery to Texas markets other than Lone Star's distribution systems.Lone Star states that upon the issuance of the requested authorization,the interstate pipeline facilities to be abandoned fro interstate commerceunder the proposed realignment will function as intrastate pipeline facilities,as ninety-five percent by volume of the gas which will move through thefacilities to be abandoned will be intrastate in character, produced fromsources located in Texas and consumed by customers located in Texas, andwill at no time be carried across a state boundary line. Any interstategas to be carried in the future by the facilities to be abandoned willbe transported pursuant to NGPA section 311(a)(2). It is further stated that upon issuance by the Commission of the requestedauthorization, the jurisdictional points of demarcation to be establishedbetween Lone Star's Intrastate facilities and Lone Star's interstate facilitieswill be used as points of interconnection where gas can be metered intoor out of Lone Star's interstate and intrastate facilities so that properreports can be filed by each transporter under part 284 of the Commission'sRegulations, in accordance with the Commission's expectation as expressedon page 8 of the Order Granting Petition for Declaratory Order issued toLone Star Gas Company on December 26, 1984, 29 FERC andpara; 61,340 (1984).Lone Star states that issuance by the Commission of authorization for therealignment as proposed in this Application will facilitate the transportationof gas by Lone Star both North and South across the Texas-Oklahoma StateLine as the market demand and gas load shifts and will ultimately allowLone Star to better fulfill the need of its transportation customers. Lone Star further states that implementation of the proposed realignmentwill allow Lone Star to abandon and retire from service 33.8 miles of pipelineand its Benjamin compressor station on the present intrastate portion ofits facilities. Retirement of these facilities will allow Lone Star tosave $5,054,000 in net avoided replacement cost in the next two years,and to avoid $117,000 in repair and maintenance expense and $730,000 inoperating and routine maintenance expense (including compressor fuel cost)during a ten year time period. Lone Star also states that after implementationof the proposed realignment, its New York storage facility will be usedto one hundred percent capacity for augmenting gas supplies on peak daysto the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex and through Lines 71 and 72 in the TexasPanhandle area, increasing system reliability and reducing curtailmenton the intrastate portion of Lone Star's facilities.<T3>Comment date: </T3>August 16, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">3.

It is explained that although this firm transportationwithin contract demand service is to be provided under the new sales serviceagreement instead of under a separate TF-1 transportation service agreement,it still will be subject to the Rate Schedule TF-1 terms and conditionsto the extent such terms and conditions are not superceded or modifiedby the new sales service agreement. It is further explained that to complywith the provisions in Rate Schedule TF-1 concerning receipt point flexibility,Northwest will require its sales customers to forecast by the twenty-fifthof each month which receipt points and volumes are anticipated for nominationas transportation within contract demand during the following month. Uponevaluating the availability of firm capacity at the forcasted points, Northwestwould provide any required notice to the customer and affected interruptibleshippers, it is explained, Northwest states that it does not propose toaccept nominations for transportation within contract demand service thatexceed the monthly forecasts. Northwest asserts that the most significantRate Schedule TF-1 terms and conditions which are overridden by the newsales service agreement are the rate provisions. Northwest further assertsthe new sale service agreements specify that firm transportation withinsales contract demand service will be subject to a rate equal to the commoditycharge for transportation under Northwest's Rate Schedule TI-1.Northwest further states that the new service agreements specifically addressthe GIC issue by establishing a mutually agreeable GIC procedure as anintegral part of the service agreements. Exhibit B to each new serviceagreement presently incorporates the terms and conditions of the GIC whichNorthwest proposed in Docket No. CP86-578 and Article V of the serviceagreements provides for the implementation of a GIC under either of twopotential scenarios depending upon the results of Northwest's pending GICproceeding in Docket No. CP86-578. Namely: (a) If the Commission approvesa GIC in Docket No. CP86-578 by October 1, 1989 which is acceptable toboth Northwest and its sales customers, then Exhibit B to the new serviceagreements will be revised to incorporate the terms and conditions of suchGIC and the GIC will be implemented under the service agreement in accordancewith the Commission's approval in Docket No. CP86-578; or (b) if the Commissioneither does not approve a GIC in Docket No. CP86-578 by October 1, 1989or else approves a GIC which is not acceptable to either Northwest or itscustomers, then the GIC provisions set forth in Exhibit B to the serviceagreements will be revised to reflect a minimum annual exemption levelbased upon 58%, instead of 60% of the customer's contract demand and toimpose a minimum annual take requirement under each service agreement.Northwest states that such revised GIC would be implemented under the individualservice agreements in accordance with Exhibit B and the Commission's approvalin this proceeding. The mutually agreed upon minimum annual take requirementunder the service agreement in this case is based upon Northwest's minimumannual purchase obligations from its suppliers and initially would requireeach customer to purchase gas at an annual load factor based upon 26% ofthe customer's daily contract demand, but such load factor would be reducedcommensurately with any future reductions in Northwest's minimum annualtake obligations, it is explained.Northwest requests the Commission to grant a certificate of public convenienceand necessity authorizing it to provide a charge for all the services coveredby its new ODL-1 and DS-1 sales service agreements effective October 1,1989. Such services include:(1) Continuation of firm sales up to the contract demand levels under therespective service agreements, with such sales to be made at the deliverypoints and subject to the reallocated delivery point MDDQ's as set forthon the new Exhibit A to the respective service agreements.(2) Firm transportation within contract demand for each customer up toa volume equal to the difference between the customer's respective salescontract demand and daily sales nomination, subject to capacity availability.(3) Maintaining gas supply inventory at a level sufficient to enable Northwestto reliably serve its customers at contract demand sales levels subjectto the GIC provisions referenced in the new sales service agreements.Northwest states that the rates which it proposes to apply to servicesunder the new sales service agreements will be set forth on Sheet No. 10of Volume No. 1 of Northwest's FERC Gas Tariff. Northwest states that theRate Schedule ODL-1 and DS-1 rates will include the Demand-1, Demand-2and commodity charges which historically have been applicable to such salesservices. Northwest further states that in addition, the ODL-1 and DS-1rates now will include a GIC component to be applied to deficiency salesvolumes; i.e. the difference between actual gas purchases and the customer'sminimum annual exemption level. It is explained that the initial GIC rateis proposed to be 30.12 cents per MMBtu. Finally, Northwest explains thatthe ODL-1 rates also now will include a firm transportation within contractdemand charge, equivalent to Northwest's Rate Schedule TI-1 rate, whichwill be applied to firm transportation volumes which are nominated by thecustomer and delivered by Northwest as transportation within sales contractdemand. Northwest explains that the initial rate for this service componentwould be 21.03 cents per MMBtu, assuming timely Commission approval ofthe TI-1 rate reflected in the offer of settlement filed by Northwest inDocket No. RP88-47 on March 31, 1989.Northwest also requests the issuance of an order permitting and approvingthe partial abandonment of firm Rate Schedule ODL-1 sales service to Greeleyin the amount of 3,323 Dt per day of firm sales contract demand, effectiveOctober 1, 1989, which represents the portion of Greeley's existing contractdemand which it declined to convert to firm transportation.Northwest avers that it and its customers have freely negotiated the subjectnew sales service agreements which provide for the future levels of salesservice desired by Northwest's customers subject to mutually acceptableterms and conditions. Northwest further avers that establishing these continuingcommitments for specific quantities of its system supply gas will allowNorthwest to complete the realignment of its gas supplies to most efficientlymatch its obligations to serve the needs of it customers. In particular,Northwest now will be able to complete its negotiations for an appropriategas purchase contract with its Canadian supplier to replace the existingcontract which expires October 31, 1989.Further, Northwest avers that the firm transportation within contract demandprovision of Northwest's new firm sales service agreements ensures customerflexibility to swing between sales gas and transportation gas to meet requirements.Northwest states that basically, the customers will be free to make gaspurchase decisions based upon the comparative prices of gas; i.e. the purchaseprice of transportation gas plus Northwest's firm transportation withincontract demand charge versus Northwest's ODL-1 commodity sales rate whichincludes both a purchased gas cost component and a system transmissioncost component.Finally, Northwest avers that the GIC provisions incorporated in its newsales service agreements have been freely negotiated and agreed upon byNorthwest and its affected customers as a settlement of the basis uponwhich Northwest can continue to provide a merchant service and should bedeemed to be in the public interest since they are consistent both withthe Commission's Notice of Proposed Policy Statement in Docket No. PL89-1-000and the principles elucidated in 18 CFR 2.105. Northwest states that implementationof the GIC provisions will both encourage customer behavior conducive tominimizing take-or-pay incurrence by Northwest and provide an equitablemechanism for Northeast to be compensated for take-or-pay charges it mayincur as a result of fulfilling its obligations to maintain sufficientgas supply to sell gas at contract demand levels while its customers havethe flexibility to eschew sales gas, to a great extent, for transportationgas.<T3>Comment date: </T3>August 16, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">13.

Texas Eastern proposes to assign its interestin the Properties to TEOC upon receipt of the required regulatory approval.It states that Texas Eastern and TEOC have entered into contracts for thepurchase and sale of natural gas produced from the Properties. TEOC proposesto eventually sell the bulk of these Properties to an entity or entitieswhose primary business is the exploration and production of oil and gas.It is alleged that Texas Eastern also intends to offer for sale certaininterests in oil and gas leases properties located in Arkansas, New Mexico,Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Federal offshore areas, in which TexasEastern has royalty interests. It is averred that if the Commission believesabandonment authorization is necessary prior to sale of these interests,Texas Eastern requests such authorization. Texas Eastern also proposesto offer for sale certain unencumbered mineral estates and/or surface estateslocated in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Texas. There are no reserves, productionor revenue associated with these properties; therefore Texas Eastern believesabandonment authorization is not necessary. If however, the Commissionbelieves abandonment authorization is necessary, prior to the sale of theseproperties, Texas Eastern requests such authorization in this filing.Texas Eastern alleges that it's jurisdictional customers would not be adverselyaffected by the proposal. It is claimed that the proposed abandonment wouldnot result in any interruption, reduction or termination of gas servicecurrently provided to Texas Eastern's customers. The same service thatTexas Eastern has provided with respect to the Properties would be providedby TEOC. It is asserted that even eventual sale of the Properties, subjectto any necessary abandonment authorization, would not adversely effectTexas Eastern's customers. The Properties would be sold subject to existinggas purchase contracts that dedicate the gas to Texas Eastern under theterms of each contract. The remaining net deliverability and reserves onthese Properties are very small, estimated at January 1, 1989, to be approximately1.7 MMcf per day and 3.1 Bcf in total.

The storage agreements further provide that during eachWinter Period (November 1-March 31), Applicant will redeliver to CNG atWoodhull such daily volumes as Customers may request, up to the MaximumDaily Withdrawal Quantity, less a volume of gas for compressor fuel usageequal to 0.6% of the volumes requested to be withdrawn. For all customersexcept Commonwealth Gas Company (Com Gas), CNG will redeliver equivalentvolumes to Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) near Leidy,Pennsylvania for ultimate delivery to the respective customers. Additionally,CNG will redeliver equivalent volumes of gas on behalf of Com Gas to TennesseeGas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) near Morrisville, New York for ultimateredelivery to Com Gas. The Applicant states that the primary term of the storage agreement betweenApplicant and Customer is twenty (20) years, commencing April 1, 1991,or on such later date when Applicant shall notify Customers that its storagefacilities are ready to accept deliveries of gas for storage. Applicant states that in the event that during any Winter Period it wasunable to tender for redelivery volumes of gas which a Customer requestedwithin the Customer's contract entitlements; unless Customer, Applicantand transporters are able to agree upon and effect make-up of such deficiencyduring the balance of such Winter Period, then Customer would be entitledto a credit against future monthly charges. Applicant states that thiscredit would be equal to the sum of all such day's deficiencies which arenot made up, multiplied by a rate per Mcf equivalent to the total of theDeliverability Rate and the Storage Capacity Rate.According to Applicant, the storage agreements also allow for deliveryand redelivery of volumes of gas in excess of a Customer's Maximum StorageVolume during any contract year and for the delivery and redelivery ofexcess daily injection and withdrawal volumes if Applicant has sufficientcapacity to provide such overrun service. In addition, Applicant states,the storage agreements provide the option to inject gas during the WinterPeriod, and to withdraw gas during the Summer Period.The Applicant states that as necessary, CNG and Transco would file separateapplications with the FERC for authority to construct and operate any additionalfacilities required to interconnect with Applicant, and for authority toprovide firm transportation service on behalf of any Customer requestingfirm transportation service. Among the Customers, Com Gas, according toApplicant, currently intends to have its storage injection gas deliveredto CNG, and its storage withdrawal gas received from CNG and redeliveredto Com Gas by means of interruptible transportation service provided byTennessee under Tennessee's ``open access'' interruptible transportationrate schedule. Applicant states also that Tennessee may, at some pointin the future file an application with the FERC to obtain authorizationto construct and operate the facilities necessary to provide the storagetransportation services for Com Gas on a firm basis.In order to provide the storage services proposed herein, Applicant proposesto acquire the property rights and interests necessary to develop and operatethe Adrian Gas Field located in the Town of Canisteo, Steuben County, NewYork as an underground natural gas storage field with a working storagecapacity of 6,200 MMcf. The storage services proposed herein will necessitatethe construction of certain new facilities at a total estimated cost of$27,873,000. Accordingly, Applicant proposes to convert the one existingwell to an injection/withdrawal well, drill and complete 8 new injection/withdrawalwells and one new observation well, install the necessary gathering system,construct a 2,700 horsepower class compressor station with all ancillaryfacilities and, install approximately 13.9 miles of 12andmin16; diameterpipeline to connect the storage field to the existing transmission pipelineof CNG. To provide base gas to operate the storage field, Applicant statesit will purchase the remaining native gas in the field and inject an additional1,658 MMcf of gas, 50% of which would be acquired from CNG at a price equalto its Rate Schedule SCQ.As consideration for providing these natural gas storage services, Customerswill pay Applicant the monthly charges set forth in section 8.1 of ArticleVIII of the storage agreements. Such charges include a monthly DeliverabilityRate of $4.6146 per Mcf of Storage Demand Withdrawal Quantity, a MonthlyCapacity Rate of $.0443 per Mcf of Maximum Storage Volume, and injectionrate of $.0032 per Mcf and a withdrawal rate of $.0032 per Mcf. These arethe initial rates proposed by Storage Company. Furthermore, Storage Companyhas agreed to limit its ability to change these proposed initial ratesby limiting the amount of an increase for which it may file should certainconstruction costs increase over the construction costs projected in thisapplication.Applicant submits that the storage service proposed to be provided hereinis and will be required by the present and future public convenience andnecessity. As demonstrated by their executing storage agreements with Applicant,the customers need additional storage service to meet their various peakday and winter period requirements during the 1991-1992, and subsequent,heating seasons. The storage services proposed by this application wouldpermit Applicant's customers to serve growing, high priority markets, inthe future and potentially replace more expensive alternative fuels.
