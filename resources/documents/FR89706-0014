List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 131 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">A. Background</ITAG>On February 7, 1986, the Environmental Protection Agency received a requestfrom the Colville Confederated Tribes to promulgate the Tribes water qualitystandards as Federal standards for waters of the reservation. AlthoughTribal standards had recently been adopted, the Tribe was concerned thattheir standards were not Federally recognized under Clean Water Act (``CWA''or ``the Act'') section 303.Section 303(c)(4) of the CWA authorizes the EPA Administrator to promulgateFederal water quality standards for waters of the Nation, including waterson Indian lands, whenever he determines a revised or new standard is ``necessaryto meet the requirements of the Act.'' The CWA does not, by itself, authorizeStates to implement or enforce water quality management programs on Indianlands. In some cases a State may have authority to regulate the water qualityof a particular Indian land because of a treaty or a Federal statute. WhereState authority may be in doubt, it may be appropriate for EPA to promulgateFederal water quality standards for waters on Indian lands.Subsequent to receiving the request from the Colville Confederated Tribes,Congress passed the CWA amendments of 1987. These amendments establishedin the Act a new section 518 which addresses the issue of water qualitystandards on Indian lands and directs EPA to promulgate regulations specifyinghow Indian Tribes shall be treated as States for purposes of the waterquality standards program. Despite the pending opportunity to qualify tobe treated as a State for purposes of water quality standards, the ColvilleConfederated Tribes, in commenting on the proposed rulemaking, expressedenthusiastic support for EPA's action to promulgate Federal water qualitystandards for the reservation.EPA is in the process of responding to the Section 518 directive to specifyhow Indian Tribes shall be treated as States for purposes of water qualitystandards. If, after promulgation of the regulations pursuant to section518, the Colville Confederated Tribes qualify for the standards programand submit standards which are approved by EPA, EPA will withdraw theseFederal water quality standards at the Tribes request.EPA notes that today's rule does not establish a precedent for future EPApromulgations. This promulgation action is unique because: (1) It was initiatedbefore the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act were enacted, and (2)it is based on water quality standards previously developed by the ColvilleConfederated Tribes for application to waters on their reservation. Thisprocess is not intended as a model for other reservations. Where otherIndian Tribes wish to establish standards under the CWA, EPA would expectsuch Tribes to apply, under the CWA section 518 regulation, to be treatedas States for purposes of water quality standards. Once recognized by EPAas qualified to be treated as States, such Tribes would be responsiblefor developing their own water quality standards under the Act and makingongoing refinements to suit particular Tribal needs.Indian Tribes should not conclude from today's action that Federal promulgationis EPA's preferred method of establishing water quality standards on reservations.Historically, EPA's preference has been to work cooperatively with Stateson water quality standards issues and to initiate Federal promulgationactions only where absolutely necessary. EPA believes that this preferenceis consistent with the intent of the Act to provide States, and Tribesqualifying for treatment as States, with the first opportunity to set standards.Today's rule represents only the ninth Federal promulgation of water qualitystandards to be completed by EPA. Six of the eight completed Federal promulgationshave been withdrawn. Tribes should also note that Federal promulgationof water quality standards is a very deliberate process. In the case oftoday's rule, it took EPA more than three years (from the time of the requestby the Colville Confederated Tribes until today's final action) to promulgatefinal water quality standards.The CWA amendments of 1987 also added new section 303(c)(2)(B), which requiresthat States ``* * * shall adopt criteria for all toxic pollutants listedpursuant to section 307(a)(1) of this Act for which criteria have beenpublished under section 304(a), the discharge or presence of which in theaffected waters could reasonably be expected to interfere with those designateduses.'' As part of the proposed rulemaking, EPA decided not to proposenumeric criteria for section 307(a) pollutants for inclusion in the Colvillereservation water quality standards.In response to comments received on the proposed rulemaking, EPA consideredpromulgating today's rule as proposed and simultaneously proposing numerictoxics criteria for the reservation. EPA decided against this action primarilybecause there are no known or suspected sources of toxics on the reservation.The Colville Confederated Tribes report only one point source dischargeron the reservation and no toxics discovered from that discharger. EPA isaware of no other sources or potential sources of toxics in the area. Althoughthe State of Washington has adopted twenty numeric toxics criteria forthe protection of aquatic life, and the State and the Tribes have an agreementto maintain consistent standards on common bodies of water, EPA is nota party to this agreement. For the reasons stated above, it is EPA's judgmentthat toxics criteria should not be proposed at this time.This decision does not preclude the Tribes from amending their own waterquality standards to include toxics criteria. Tribal adoption would allowthe Tribes to develop any associated monitoring capabilities or otherwisemake arrangements for such monitoring without EPA intervention.Until numeric toxics criteria are adopted by EPA (or by the Tribes if theyqualify for treatment as a State for purposes of the standards program)in response to additional information substantiating the need for numerictoxics criteria, EPA will use the Agency's 304(a) criteria guidance toimplement the narrative toxics ``free from'' criterion in any situationthat might arise concerning the discharge of toxics.EPA believes this decision is appropriate, under the present circumstances,and that it is consistent with CWA section 303(c)(2)(B) and EPA's IndianPolicy. This decision was made after careful consideration of the availableinformation and the somewhat transitional nature of water quality managementon the reservation (i.e., the pending CWA section 518 regulations). Thedecision not to adopt numeric toxics criteria for the reservation shouldnot be interpreted as a general reluctance on the part of the Agency toadopt numeric toxics criteria, nor does it preclude proposing such criteriain the future.Additional background information can be found in the proposed rulemaking,which appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 15, 1988 (53 FR26968). Public commentson the proposal were invited until September 13, 1988. A public hearingwas held August 18, 1988 on the Colville Indian Reservation in Nespelem,Washington. Fourteen people attended this hearing. EPA received four lettersand statements on the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Response to Public Comments</ITAG>Comments on the proposed rulemaking were received from the Colville ConfederatedTribes, the Puyallup Tribe, Cavenham Forest Industries, Inc., and the Stateof Washington Department of Ecology (DOE). These comments and EPA's responsesare presented below.One commenter strongly suggested that EPA should withdraw the proposedrule. The commenter asserted that it is unnecessary for EPA to promulgatewater quality standards under section 303(c)(4)(B) of the Act because theState of Washington has already adopted and implemented standards for thereservation. The commenter contested EPA's assertion that the Act doesnot authorize States to implement or enforce their water quality standardson Indian lands. The commenter cited section 510 of the Act as evidencethat the Act does not preempt state jurisdiction.EPA disagrees with this analysis. Under accepted principles of FederalIndian Law, State authority to regulate activities on Indian lands is generallypreempted absent an explicit Congressional statute to the contrary. <T3>California </T3>v. <T3>Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, </T3>107 S.Ct. 1083, 1092 and n.18(1987). The CWA contains no language which explicitly grants a State theauthority to regulate activities related to water quality management onIndian lands. Section 510 of the Act clarifies only that the CWA does notpreempt a State from adopting any water quality standard or effluent limitationmore stringent than the Federal minima. <T3>International Paper Co. </T3>v. <T3>Ouelette, </T3> 107 S.Ct. 805 (1987). Section 510 does not, however,address the authority of a State to implement or enforce its water qualitystandards on Indian lands.EPA construes the CWA in a manner very similar to the Resource, Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) with respect to Congressional authorization ofState jurisdiction on Indian lands. As with the CWA, RCRA does not explicitlydiscuss or address the extent of a State's authority to regulate environmentalactivities on Indian lands. On this basis, EPA decided in 1983 not to authorizethe State of Washington to regulate hazardous waste activities on Indianlands in the State (48 FR 34954 (1983)). EPA rejected Washington's argumentthat the statutory language of RCRA authorized the State's assertion ofjurisdiction over Indian lands within the State. This decision was upheldby the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. <T3>Washington Dept. of Ecology </T3>v. EPA, 752 F.2d 1465 (9th Cir. 1985).The court found that, in light of Congressional silence, EPA had reasonablyinterpreted RCRA not to grant the State jurisdiction over activities onIndian lands. The court noted that EPA's interpretation was ``buttressedby well-settled principles of Federal Indian law.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 1469. As with RCRA, EPA rejects the argument that the CWAconstitutes Congressional authorization of State regulatory jurisdictionover discharges to surface waters on Indian lands.The same commenter also argued that the State retains inherent authorityto regulate water quality on fee lands owned by non-Indians. This commenterasserted that EPA promulgation of water quality standards for the Colvillereservation is unnecessary because the State of Washington has alreadyestablished water quality standards which apply, at a minimum, over feelands owned by non-Indians within the exterior boundaries of the reservation.EPA does not believe it necessary to resolve this issue. First, the Tribeand Washington have an agreement that water quality standards on and offthe reservation will be as similar as possible. Also, the State of Washington,in a companion agreement with EPA, has already agreed that, in the absenceof Tribal NPDES program assumption, EPA will issue all future NPDES permitson the reservation (without conceding its own authority to do so underState law).\1\<NOTE/> As a result, to give effect to these agreements, EPA believesit necessary and appropriate to promulgate the standards contained in today'srule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A copy of both cooperative agreements is available inthe docket for today's rule.EPA notes that there may be some doubts as to whether the State of Washingtonwould be able to adequately demonstrate its authority under State law toregulate activities affecting surface water quality on the Colville reservationin light of the relevant precedents regarding preemption of state regulatoryauthority on Indian lands.\2\<NOTE/> As the commenter noted, the proper test for determining theextent of State regulatory authority was clearly stated by the SupremeCourt in <T3>Cabazon</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ EPA has also determined that the State of Washington cannotadequately demonstrate its authority to regulate hazardous waste activitiesand underground injection activities on Indian lands in the State, andhas declined to authorize Washington to administer these programs on Indianlands. <T3>See Washington Dept. of Ecology v. EPA, </T3>752 F.2d 1465 (9th Cir.1985) (hazardous waste); 53 FR 42,080 (1988) (underground injection).<ITAG tagnum="21">State jurisdiction is pre-empted * * * if it interferes or is incompatiblewith Federal and tribal interests reflected in Federal law unless the Stateinterests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of State authority.The inquiry is to proceed in light of traditional notions of Indian self-government,including its overriding goal of encouraging tribal self-sufficiency andeconomic development.</ITAG><T3>Cabazon, </T3>107 S.Ct. at 1092 (quoting <T3>New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, </T3>462 U.S. 324, 333-35 (1983)).EPA believes that the adoption of section 518 of the CWA evinces strongCongressional preference for Tribal control of water quality on Indianreservations, where the Tribe meets the statutory criteria. Thus, the Federalinterest in ensuring enforcement of tribal water quality standards is strongand the continued applicability of the State standards may be subject toquestion. However, in light of the fact that both the Tribe and the Statehave ``plac[ed] environmental protection ahead of jurisdictional conflictsin developing the (tribal water quality management) plan,'' \3\<NOTE/> EPA does not today attempt to finally resolve this question,nor does it feel that it must resolve this question before it can findthat today's rule is necessary under section 303(c)(4)(B) of the CWA. Thus,EPA declines to do so.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Ernesta Barnes, Regional Administrator, RegionX, to the Honorable Booth Gardner, Governor, State of Washington, August28, 1985, a copy of which is in the docket for today's rule.Finally, this commenter argued that EPA may not promulgate these standards,since the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation have not qualifiedto be treated as a State under section 518 of the CWA for purposes of developingwater quality standards for EPA approval under section 303 of the CWA.EPA believes that the commenter may have misunderstood the statutory basisfor today's action. Section 518(e) establishes statutory prerequisitesthat must be satisfied by a Tribe before it may submit water quality standardsfor approval by EPA under section 303. EPA is in the process of developingregulations to implement section 518 for purposes of the standards program,which it plans on proposing in the summer of 1989 for public comment. However,today's action is not an approval of Tribal standards under section 303(a)(3)(A),but Federal promulgation of standards under 303(c)(4)(B). Section 518 doesnot affect EPA's authority to promulgate Federal water quality standards.The statutory context in which today's rule is adopted is very similarto the situation presented to the U.S. Court of Appeals in <T3>Phillips Petroleum Co. </T3>v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 803 F.2d 545 (10th Cir. 1986). In that case, Phillips challengedEPA's regulation promulgating a Federal Underground Injection Control (UIC)program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for the Osage MineralReserve. Phillips argued that EPA lacked the authority to promulgate suchregulations prior to the 1986 SDWA Amendments, which explicitly authorizedEPA to promulgate Federal UIC programs on Indian lands. The Tenth Circuitupheld EPA's regulations, stating that the strong national interest inapplying SDWA regulatory standards ``ocean to ocean'' overcame Congress'failure to address the implenemtation of SDWA on Indian lands. <T3>Id</T3>., at 553, 555-56. The Court also noted that its conclusionthat ``the SDWA empowered the EPA to prescribe regulations for Indian landsis also consistent with the presumption that Congress intends a generalstatute applying to all persons to include Indians and their property interests.''<T3>Id</T3>. at 556. EPA believes that same logic applies to the CWA, bothprior to and subsequent to the adoption of section 518.EPA disagrees that today's action would be premature or inconsistent withthe regulations to be developed under section 518. One commenter statedthat adoption of section 518 supersedes EPA's 1984 Indian Policy statementand the cooperative agreements discussed above, which were adopted pursuantto the policy. EPA disagrees with this statement. Adoption of section 518grew out of EPA's efforts to implement the CWA on Indian lands in a mannerconsistent with the 1984 policy. There is no legislative history to suggestCongress intended EPA to alter its 1984 policy; indeed it suggests theopposite. Furthermore, section 518(d) of the CWA explicitly authorizesStates and Tribes to enter cooperative agreements ``to jointly plan andadminister the requirements of (the CWA),'' precisely what the Tribe andthe State have done.EPA does not believe that today's action must wait for section 518 regulationsto be finalized. The Confederated Tribes requested EPA to promulgate theTribal water quality standards as Federal standards on February 7, 1986,nearly one year before passage of the Water Quality Act of 1987. EPA seesno reason to delay promulgation of this rule while regulations are developedunder section 518. EPA notes that, in a draft of the regulations to beproposed under section 518 which has been made publicly available, Federalpromulgation of standards on Indian lands is mentioned as one method ofimplementing the water quality standards program (although not the preferredmethod, as discussed above), where the Tribe is not yet able, or choosesnot to qualify for treatment as a State and submit its own standards forapproval. Consistent with the draft regulations, EPA believes that today'saction is entirely consistent with section 518 of the CWA. EPA would alsopoint out that if, after promulgation of the regulations authorizing IndianTribes to develop water quality standards, the Confederated Tribes of theColville reservation qualify for the standards program and submit standardswhich are approved by EPA, EPA will withdraw these Federal water qualitystandards at the Tribes' request.One commenter noted that although a narrative toxics ``free from'' criterionwas included in the proposal, numeric criteria were not, and recommendedthat EPA consider the fact that the State of Washington adopted numericcriteria for certain toxics in January, 1988, and propose to adopt equivalentcritera for reservation/State boundary waters.Although an agreement exists between the State and the Tribe to maintainconsistent water quality standards on boundary waters, this agreement doesnot involve EPA. It is EPA's judgment that, at present, it is appropriatenot to propose numeric toxics criteria for waters of the Colville reservation.A primary factor in this decision is that EPA knows of no toxic pollutantthat can reasonably be expected to be interfering with designated usesof the reservation. The Colville Tribes report only one point source dischargeron the reservation and no toxics discovered from that discharger. EPA isaware of no other source of toxics in the area. Given these circumstances,numeric criteria for CWA section 307(a) pollutants are not required byCWA section 303(c)(2)(B). Until the Tribes qualify for treatment as a Statefor purposes of the standards program, or until additional informationsubstantiating the need for numeric toxics criteria leads EPA to adoptnumeric toxics criteria, EPA believes it is sufficient for the Agency touse the Agency's 304(a) criteria guidance to implement the narrative toxics``free from'' criterion in any situation that might arise concerning thedischarge of toxics.One commenter noted that EPA erroneously noted in the Preamble to the proposedrulemaking that the Colville Water Quality Standards Act was amended byresolution (andplusmin;1985-20) after the August 28, 1985 EPA approval ofthe Colville Water Quality Management Program, when in fact the amendmentoccurred before such EPA approval. EPA acknowledges the error.One commenter noted several differences between the standards adopted bythe State of Washington and the proposal. First, the State standards usethe fecal coliform organism as a bacterial indicator, instead of enterococcusas used in the proposal. Second, the proposed Class III (equivalent toState B waters) includes primary contact recreation as a designated use,while State Class B does not. Third, the proposed Class III and IV havedifferent oxygen criteria than equivalent State Class B and C.With regard to the first difference, EPA uses enterococcus because researchhas established that it is a better indicator. EPA encourages the Stateto change its bacterial indicator to be consistent with EPA's section 304(a)guidance. With regard to the second difference, EPA has included primarycontact recreation as a designated use in support of the fishable/swimmablegoal of the Clean Water Act, and assumes that the State conducts Use AttainabilityAnalyses during each triennial review to determine whether the primarycontact recreation use is attainable in their Class B waters. With regardto the third difference, EPA has based the dissolved oxygen criteria onthe 1986 dissolved oxygen criteria document, and encourages States to updatetheir criteria to reflect the most recent aquatic effects research.<ITAG tagnum="84"> C. Changes to the Proposed Rule</ITAG>On EPA's initiative, the definition of ``Reservation'' was changed in thefinal rule to be consistent with the statutory definition provided in section518 of the CWA. Specifically, the definition of ``Reservation'' which appearedin the proposed rulemaking was expanded to also include the language whichwas used in defining ``Federal Indian Reservation'' in CWA section 518(h)(i.e., ``Federal Indian Reservation'' means all land within the limitsof any Indian Reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government,notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-wayrunning through the reservation). Since the definition of ``reservation''in section 518(h) tracks the common definition of the term (see 18 U.S.C.1151(a)), this change will have no substantive effect on the rule. Thechange is meant only as a clarification.On EPA's initiative, paragraph (c)(2) was re-written to be consistent withthe requirements of andSection; 131.13 of the water quality standards regulation.Section 131.13 authorizes the States to adopt general policies affectingthe application of their water quality standards such as mixing zone, variance,and low-flow policies, but only if such policies are included as a partof the State's water quality standards. Proposed paragraph (c)(2), however,would have allowed the Regional Administrator to implement such generalpolicies without including such policies in andSection; 131.35. The new paragraph(c)(2) establishes a mixing zone policy in andSection; 131.35, consistentwith andSection; 131.13, which authorizes the Regional Administrator to designatemixing zones, provided that such mixing zones are consistent with the mostcurrent EPA mixing zone guidelines in the Water Quality Standards Handbookand the Technical Support Document for Water Quality Based Toxics Control.EPA notes that a low-flow policy was already included in proposed paragraph(c)(6). At this time, EPA declines to establish a variance policy in andSection;131.35.On EPA's initiative, the definition of ``Acute toxicity'' was changed inthe final rule to be more consistent with the definition of ``acute'' inEPA's Technical Support Document for Water Quality Based Toxics Control.The proposed definition limited acutely toxics effects only to mortalityand the period of exposure only to 96 hours.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>., EPA must prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis forall proposed regulations that have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. EPA has determined that, because a Tribal regulationis already in place which is essentially equivalent in stringency to thisrule, this Rule will not have significant adverse impact on small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84"> E. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of preparing a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis. A major rule is defined as a regulation which is likely to resultin:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers; individual industries;Federal, State, and local government agencies; or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.EPA has determined that this rule does not meet the definition of a majorregulation; therefore, no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. Also,as required by Executive Order 12291 this rule has been reviewed by theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB). Any written comments from OMB toEPA and any response to those comments are available for public inspectionthrough contacting the person listed at the beginning of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Promulgation of Federal water quality standards was one of the actionscontemplated under the water quality standards regulation, which is coveredby ICR andplusmin; 2040-0049 approved by OMB.

(1) <T3>Classification Boundaries. </T3>At the boundary between waters of differentclassifications, the water quality standards for the higher classificationshall prevail. (2) <T3>Antidegradation Policy. </T3>This antidegradation policy shall be applicableto all surface waters of the Reservation. (i) Existing in-stream water uses and the level of water quality necessaryto protect the existing uses shall be maintained and protected. (ii) Where the quality of the waters exceeds levels necessary to supportpropagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on thewater, that quality shall be maintained and protected unless the RegionalAdministrator finds, after full satisfaction of the inter-governmentalcoordination and public participation provisions of the Tribes' continuingplanning process, that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodateimportant economic or social development in the area in which the watersare located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the RegionalAdministrator shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing usesfully. Further, the Regional Administrator shall assure that there shallbe achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all newand existing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best managementpractices for nonpoint source control. (iii) Where high quality waters are identified as constituting an outstandingnational or reservation resource, such as waters within areas designatedas unique water quality management areas and waters otherwise of exceptionalrecreational or ecological significance, and are designated as specialresource waters, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.(iv) In those cases where potential water quality impairment associatedwith a thermal discharge is involved, this antidegradation policy's implementingmethod shall be consistent with section 316 of the Clean Water Act. (3) <T3>Aesthetic Qualities. </T3>All waters within the Reservation, includingthose within mixing zones, shall be free from substances, attributableto wastewater discharges or other pollutant sources, that: (i) Settle to form objectionable deposits; (ii) Float as debris, scum, oil, or other matter forming nuisances; (iii) Produce objectionable color, odor, taste, or turbidity; (iv) Cause injury to, are toxic to, or produce adverse physiological responsesin humans, animals, or plants; or (v) produce undesirable or nuisance aquatic life. (4) <T3>Analytical Methods. </T3>(i) The analytical testing methods used tomeasure or otherwise evaluate compliance with water quality standards shallto the extent practicable, be in accordance with the ``Guidelines EstablishingTest Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants'' (40 CFR Part 136). Whena testing method is not available for a particular substance, the mostrecent edition of ``Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater''(published by the American Public Health Association, American Water WorksAssociation, and the Water Pollution Control Federation) and other or supersedingmethods published and/or approved by EPA shall be used.
