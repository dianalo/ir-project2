Endowed with one-fifth ofhumanity and a central location in the Far East, China is anation whose cooperation could be of huge value in setting upa thriving world order built on democracy and trade.   But given the clammy persistence of communism in China,there is little opportunity today for any foreign diplomat todo great good in Beijing. The best we can hope for is thatthey will avoid shoring up a Leninist regime.</LP><TEXT>   By these lights, Mr. Baker did well during his three-dayvisit. It is even a small success that he emerged Sunday froma grueling round of meetings having traded a lot of talk fora small bundle of vague Chinese proposals on arms control,human rights and copyright protection.   But no one should assume that China's government wouldhonor its word should any of these proposals turn into a donedeal after Mr. Baker reports back to Washington.   Chinese officials told Mr. Baker that if President Bushcanceled U.S. sanctions on some arms-related trade, theywould sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and haltsales abroad of missiles and related technology.   But China's secretive and corrupt government has found itcan generate nice profits from its arms trade -- estimated byWestern intelligence sources at some $16 billion per year.Right now it is impossible to know how the resulting profitsare distributed among central government coffers, People'sLiberation Army pension funds and cadre bank accounts. It isalso hard to say who precisely in China's government has theclout and incentive to uphold international treaties. Almostanyone doing business with China knows that one of thebiggest problems is finding someone who can be heldultimately accountable for honoring a deal.   Beijing has lied before about missile sales to the MiddleEast. Now, China stands accused by the U.S. administration ofsecretly selling nuclear-arms technology and equipment toAlgeria and Iran. Before Mr. Bush lifts any sanctions onAmerican arms-related trade with China, it would be useful tohear Beijing spell out the ways in which China will allow theU.S. to monitor its compliance.   Indeed, the best first step might be for Mr. Baker's aidesto go straight to the fellows who carry the guns for theCommunist Party and propose a resumption of contacts at alllevels with the People's Liberation Army. Thethree-million-strong PLA is one of the murkiest entities inAsia, variously killing protesters on the roads intoTiananmen Square, manufacturing refrigerators in NortheastChina and working with the central government and civilianfront companies to sell weapons abroad. When the nextpolitical crisis arrives, the outcome will most likely dependon whose orders the PLA decides to follow.   Another big focus of Mr. Baker's trip was human rights. Itis no surprise that here he achieved almost no forwardmotion. The problem is that the party can arbitrarily jailand release anyone it wants to. It would have been deeplywelcome to see the release of student leader Wang Dan, orintellectuals such as Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, or anyoneelse of the many people unjustly jailed for defending theright to freedom in China. But basic liberty and justice inChina will come only after the fall of the current regime.That, sadly, is something Mr. Baker could not achieve duringa three-day state visit.   Likewise, for China to observe the rules of genuine freetrade and protection of private property requires agovernment that respects similar standards at home. China'svaunted &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot; is a systemin which the party can and usually must be bribed to overlookmarket activity.   For a voyager to an anachronistic land ruled by despotsliving off the flotsam of a failed Utopia, Mr. Baker did justfine. He did not kowtow. He did repeat at close range themessage that Americans like the Chinese people but take adark view of the Beijing government. And he returned withjust about all that China's communists have to offer thecivilized world -- basically, nothing.</TEXT></DOC>
