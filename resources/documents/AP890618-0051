Eight motorized rubber dinghies and a small sailing boatbelonging to Greenpeace, the international environmentalorganization, failed to keep the battleship from dropping anchor inKiel harbor, Greenpeace said in a statement from its Hamburg office.   A ``scuffle'' ensued when West German marine police showed upwith ``at least 15 ships and rubber boats,'' Greenpeace said.   West German television, in an early evening newscast, showed twomotorized Greenpeace dinghies just under the Iowa's giant anchor,which was hovering in the air. It also showed police boats pushingthe dinghies away.   A banner hung from the Greenpeace sailing boat, reading: ``NoNukes in Kiel. Greenpeace.''   Greenpeace said the Iowa may be carrying nuclear weapons,although the claim has not been confirmed by either West German orAmerican officials.   The police ``pushed off and hauled away'' some of the activists'rubber boats, ending the protest, Greenpeace said.   The 58,000-ton Iowa, one of the world's biggest warships, laterdropped anchor in the northern West German city's harbor.   The battleship sailed into Kiel as part of the annual ``KielWeek'' nautical show that opened Saturday.   Earlier, Greenpeace activists in Denmark tried to stop thebattleship from sailing into the Baltic Sea en route to Kiel.   Divers and people in inflatable boats stretched a floating lineacross the path of the Iowa as it steamed south through Denmark'sGreat Belt strait.   ``But the Iowa passed right through, breaking the rope,'' saidHans Kristensen of Greenpeace.   A Danish navy torpedo boat accompanied the Iowa through thestrait and military helicopters hovered overhead during the protest,Kristensen said.   The Iowa slowed momentarily as it approached the protester'sline, and then continued its voyage to Kiel, he said.   The Iowa was the scene of a disaster in April when an explosionripped through one of the ship's gun turrets, killing 47 crewmembers. The vessel was on maneuvers near Puerto Rico at the time.</TEXT></DOC>
