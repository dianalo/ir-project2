So imagine her surprise when, in late 1988, she got amargin call for $8,000 to bolster her depleted stock account.Her broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Daniel Hasbrook,had borrowed tens of thousands of dollars in her $350,000retirement account, her lawyer says.</LP><TEXT>   Mrs. Peterson, a retired Tempe, Ariz., grade-schoolprincipal who is legally blind and partially deaf, had signeda margin agreement that allowed Mr. Hasbrook to trade in heraccount with borrowed money. But on the bottom of it, shescrawled: &quot;I can't read the above fine print. I sign this onyour recommendation.&quot;   She went to arbitration and, in her complaint, accused Mr.Hasbrook of making unsuitable investments and tradingexcessively to drum up commissions. Last September, athree-member panel of the National Association of SecuritiesDealers ruled in her favor. It ordered Shearson to pay her$250,000 in compensatory damages, plus $1 million in punitivedamages -- the largest punitive award ever granted in aninvestor arbitration case.   Mr. Hasbrook, now a broker at Sears Roebuck's Dean WitterReynolds, says: &quot;There are no rules that say she couldn't beon margin.&quot; He adds, &quot;I don't feel I was ever reckless withthe account.&quot;   The securities industry has long pressed arbitration onits customers. When opening a brokerage account, manyinvestors sign a standard agreement binding them ahead oftime to accept arbitration, rather than resorting to alawsuit, in the event of a dispute with their broker. But nowthe tables have turned: As punitive awards to investorsballoon, arbitration is rapidly becoming a financial threaton Wall Street.   That's important because investors have been flocking toarbitration. They filed 6,101 arbitration cases againstbrokers and securities firms in 1988. Data for last yeararen't complete, but the 1988 total was up 115% from 1986. Bycontrast, the number of securities-related federal lawsuitsdropped 7% during the same period to 2,775, according to theAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts.   Only a few years ago, securities firms liked thearbitration process, with good reason. The cases were privateand speedy, and the firms won about half of them. The panels,which are sanctioned mostly by stock exchanges andself-regulatory organizations, are typically made up of threearbitrators, including one securities executive and sometimesothers with ties to Wall Street. They have long beenperceived as stacked against small investors, although thisis vehemently denied by the securities industry.   More important: Even when securities firms lost, theytypically didn't have to dole out much cash. The awarding ofpunitive (or exemplary) damages was relatively rare, andtriple damages under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations law were unheard of. No wonder that thesecurities industry cheered when the Supreme Court, in a 1987case involving Shearson, held that the firms could compelinvestors to take disputes to arbitration.   But Wall Streeters aren't smiling anymore. New rulesimposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission allowpretrial conferences and discovery. Hearings that used totake two days now often take five or more. And the costs arerising.   Other SEC rules promulgated last year have opened thearbitration process to public scrutiny and thus put pressureon securities firms to settle disputes to avoid badpublicity. The firms settled 37% more arbitration cases atthe NASD and 25% more at the New York Stock Exchange lastyear than in 1988, even as the number of cases filed at thetwo bodies fell slightly.   But the clearest sign of trouble for Wall Street is asurge in punitive-damage awards. Punitive damages, which aregenerally awarded to punish and deter a defendant found tohave acted recklessly or maliciously, are applied in additionto actual, or compensatory, damages, which cover the injuryor loss.   Since May 1989, when figures on arbitration awards werefirst made public, arbitration panels have granted 21punitive-damage awards totaling $4.5 million to investors.That's up from an estimated nine awards totaling $1.7 millionin the year-earlier period, says the Securities ArbitrationCommentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter.   Large punitive-damage awards are especially upsetting tosecurities firms. Shearson, which notes that the allegedincident involving Mrs. Peterson began when Mr. Hasbrookworked at E.F. Hutton (which Shearson acquired in 1988),says: &quot;We don't believe that the facts in this case supportthe size of the award, but we have agreed to abide by thedecision.&quot;   Unlike judges or juries, arbitrators don't have to spellout why they impose punitive awards, and thus they give thefirms little guidance about exactly what they did wrong. Andwinning court appeals in arbitration cases is difficultbecause federal arbitration law provides only a narrow windowfor reversing decisions.   &quot;The scariest thing as a litigator trying a {big}arbitration case,&quot; says George Schieren, assistant generalcounsel at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., &quot;is if you lose, there's noappellate cushion -- you write the check.&quot;   Securities executives still defend arbitration. Despitelonger cases and the punitive awards, arbitration remainscheaper and quicker than going to court. Moreover, lawyers atmajor brokerage firms say punitive awards are still unusual.One reason: If lawyers believe that the firm has a poor case,they try to settle it.   But big awards are alarming the securities industry. It is&quot;wondering a lot&quot; about its commitment to arbitration, saysSam Scott Miller, a former general counsel at PaineWebberGroup Inc. who now works for a New York law firm.   Says Theodore Krebsbach, Shearson's head of litigation,who successfully tried the landmark Supreme Court case: &quot;Ifthe trend continues, at some point you have to say: `What arewe trying to accomplish here?' The purpose of arbitrationisn't to give out windfalls but to make investors whole.&quot;   Attorneys at big firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynchsay they no longer automatically steer their firms toarbitration rather than letting the customer sue them incourt. They look at complaints on a case-by-case basis,weighing the facts and jurisdiction of the dispute.(Customers have always had the option of forcing a disputeinto arbitration; the 1987 Supreme Court decision essentiallygave the firms the same flexibility.)   Now, in addition to the increase in punitive damages,securities firms face the threat of triple-damage awards byarbitrators under the controversial RICO law, originallyaimed at organized crime. In January, an arbitration panel,ruling against Shearson, awarded an Oklahoma wheat farmer andhis wife $406,000, split evenly between compensatory andpunitive damages -- plus more than $600,000 in triple damagesunder RICO. It was the first time an investor arbitrationpanel awarded RICO damages.   In the case, filed in August 1988, Walter Earl Cox, 61,and his wife, Ardenia, 60, accused their Shearson broker ofunauthorized trading and said their retirement account wasunsuitable for speculative trading in stock options. In aninterview, Mrs. Cox recalls a 1985 meeting with the broker,Lindy Kent Ridinger, at the couple's farmhouse. She says heurged them to sell municipal bonds they held and buy options;he later bought 4,600 &quot;naked&quot; OEX put options for the accountin seven months.   An option gives the holder the right but not theobligation to buy (a call) or sell (a put) a stock or otherinvestment at a specified price within a stipulated period.OEX put options are bets that the Standard andamp; Poor's 100-stockindex will fall; a naked option is especially risky becausethe investor doesn't own the underlying stocks.   The Coxes eventually lost about half their $400,000account when a rising stock market hammered their optionspositions, according to papers the Coxes filed with thearbitrators.   Shearson disagreed with the size of the award, a spokesmansays, but is abiding by the decision. Mr. Ridinger pleadedguilty to a federal wire-fraud charge and served four monthsin jail. Reached in Dallas, where he now sells real estate,the 31-year-old Mr. Ridinger says he misjudged the risks ofoptions.   &quot;Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing,&quot; he saysnow. &quot;I never should have messed with them.&quot;   The excessive use of options has triggered several otherbig punitive awards. Among them is the case of Leonard Meyer,a 65-year-old Atlantan. The former wholesale liquordistributor says he never was a gambler and never believed inborrowing, not even to buy a car. But he says in an interviewthat his PaineWebber broker, Andrew Cinman, kept calling himwith a pitch for a computerized options-trading program. Mr.Meyer says Mr. Cinman contended that the program minimizedtrading risk. &quot;It's a shame you're not taking advantage ofit,&quot; Mr. Meyer quotes Mr. Cinman as saying.   Mr. Meyer says he was wary but agreed when Mr. Cinmanassured him that the options wouldn't expose the account tolosses exceeding $20,000. Between late 1986 and October 1987,Mr. Cinman made more than 150 option trades, according topapers Mr. Meyer filed with arbitrators. Then, in the October1987 stock-market plunge, Mr. Meyer lost nearly $600,000.   Robert Berson, PaineWebber's general counsel, declines tocomment. Mr. Cinman, who has left PaineWebber, couldn't bereached. But Mr. Meyer taped a conversation with the brokerjust days after the crash. According to a transcript of thetape submitted to arbitrators, the broker said: &quot;Was Imonitoring the account for a $20,000 loss? Yes. Did it happenway outside my control? Yes. Was I responsible for that? Do Ifeel responsible? Obviously, yeah, I'm responsible.&quot; APaineWebber executive confirms the authenticity of the tapebut complains that the taping was done without the broker'sknowledge.   In March 1989, an NASD arbitration panel awarded Mr. Meyer$745,000, including $500,000 in punitive damages. AfterPaineWebber filed a court motion to vacate the award, thecase was settled for about $600,000, according to peoplefamiliar with the matter.   Of course, just the fact that a broker traded options andlost a client's money isn't grounds for an arbitration award,let alone punitive damages. Here are some of the kinds ofcases in which investors stand the best chance inarbitration, according to David Robbins, a former arbitrationdirector at the American Stock Exchange and author of abooklet for investors called &quot;Securities Arbitration Guide&quot;:   Unsuitability: When a broker knew or should have knownthat an investment was inappropriate or inconsistent with thecustomer's investment objectives.   Churning: When, to obtain commissions, a broker tradedexcessively in a customer's account, in light of itscharacter, over which the broker had control.   Unauthorized Trading: When trades were made without thecustomer's approval.   Margin Accounts and Overleveraging: When the broker didn'texplain to the customer, or the customer didn't understand,that his or her stocks put up as collateral could beliquidated to meet margin calls. Even if the customer signeda margin agreement, he or she may not have understood whatthe &quot;small print&quot; meant.   Unlike juries, which are instructed by judges about when,where and how they can award punitive damages, arbitratorsessentially have free reign. But many arbitrators longassumed that the law didn't allow them to impose punitivedamages, says Richard Ryder, editor of the SecuritiesArbitration Commentator and a former director of arbitrationat the NASD.   Some securities executives still contend that punitivedamage awards are allowed in arbitration cases only wherestate law permits them. But a series of federal-court rulingsin recent years found that arbitrators do have the right toaward punitive damages under the Federal Arbitration Act,arbitration specialists say.   Nevertheless, some big financial-services firms still aretrying to fight punitive awards. Dreyfus Corp., themutual-fund group, says it is contesting a $50,000punitive-damage award handed down by an American ArbitrationAssociation panel. Roman Kent, a New York businessman whoargued the case himself, won the punitive damages againstDreyfus in March, along with $16,000 in compensatory damages,after he accused the company of, among other things,directing him into an unsuitable bond mutual fund.   &quot;It's a preposterous claim,&quot; a Dreyfus spokesman says,adding that the firm considers the punitive award &quot;totally,totally out of order.&quot; The arbitrators, Dreyfus adds, &quot;haveno authority to do it.&quot;   Of the nation's 10 arbitration forums, the AmericanArbitration Association is widely viewed as the mostsympathetic to investors. Unlike exchanges or self-regulatorybodies such as the NASD, which are subsidized by thesecurities industry, the AAA is privately funded. But mostinvestors are required by their brokerage agreements to takedisputes to the Big Board or NASD forums, which handle 92% ofall arbitration cases. Investors win about half the time insuch forums, and about 60% before the AAA, Mr. Ryder says.   When investors win punitive damages, the money sometimescomes straight out of the broker's pocket. When Jana Fongreceived $300,000 from the sale of her family's furniturebusiness in 1986, she called on Michael Goldberg, a friendand PaineWebber broker, to help her invest it. She gave him afree hand to trade her account, she says in an interview andin papers filed with arbitrators. In the next year, helaunched an aggressive naked-option program in the accountand made more than 800 trades.   Mr. Goldberg, Ms. Fong says, repeatedly assured her thatthe account was making money and that he wouldn't risk morethan 20% of it. After the market crashed, however, she wasleft with only $11,306, her arbitration filings say.   Last July, a five-member arbitration panel of the PacificStock Exchange ruled that &quot;the type of stock-options activitywas unsuitable . . . due to the extremely high risk factor.&quot;It added that &quot;there was a substantial failure&quot; byPaineWebber to supervise Mr. Goldberg. The panel awarded Ms.Fong $403,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 inpunitive damages -- $100,000 to be paid by the firm and$50,000 by Mr. Goldberg.   &quot;He betrayed me,&quot; Ms. Fong says.   &quot;I felt worse than she did,&quot; says Mr. Goldberg, now abroker at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. PaineWebber declines tocomment.   ---          Percent of 1988 arbitration cases filed                                                                                                          National Association of Securities Dealers ...... 65%                                                                                                          New York Stock Exchange ......................... 27%                                                                                                          Other ...........................................  8%                                                                                                          Source: Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration</TEXT></DOC>
