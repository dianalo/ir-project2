Is he sick and unable to contact his family? Is he dead,killed because of his association with a family member whopublicly ridiculed Saddam Hussein?</LP><TEXT>   These questions seem all the more disturbing because Ahmedis only seven years old. He and two female relatives haven'tbeen heard from since they disappeared into an Iraqi hospitalon Jan. 10.   Ahmed is one of about 300 Kuwaiti children and teen-agers,almost half of them under 12 years old, still unaccounted forafter Iraq's release thus far of 7,000 Kuwaitis following theGulf War.   Some, like Ahmed, are children who became stranded in Iraqduring Iraq's brutal seven-month occupation of Kuwait. Mostare children who were swept, along with their families, fromtheir Kuwaiti homes into Iraqi prisons. Some were takenbecause a family member was suspected of being active inKuwait's resistance; others were snatched as hostages duringthe occupation's final desperate days.   Scores of lone teen-agers, girls among them, were likewiserounded up. There also may be babies born to numerous Kuwaitiwomen, still missing, who were pregnant when jailed by theIraqis.   In addition to the youth, 1,500 Kuwaiti adults, and 600adults of other nationalities, also remain unaccounted for,according to Kuwait's National Committee for Missing Personsand POWs. For their families and friends, &quot;there will be nopeace, and no end to the nightmare&quot; of the Iraqi occupationuntil their fate is determined, says the committee's Hudaal-Meshal.   For relatives of missing children, the agony is multipliedby fears that at least some of them have been orphaned, orpurposely separated from parents or guardians, in prisonswhere malnourishment, torture and abuse were the norm.   &quot;I'm suffering because I don't know,&quot; says Emad al-Jasser,father of young Ahmed and an employee of Kuwait's InteriorMinistry. &quot;I need to know whether he is dead or alive. If heis alive, I fear that he might now be dying for lack of foodand medical care.&quot;   The Kuwaitis acknowledge a grim possibility: that many ofthose on its list, children included, may have been murderedand dumped into unmarked graves. Others could have beenkilled in Allied bombing raids. Whether all are everaccounted for will depend on &quot;a more sympathetic regime inIraq,&quot; says Dr. Ibrahim Behbehani, an activist in Kuwait'smissing-persons movement.   Iraq denies that it continues to hold any Kuwaitis, inprison or elsewhere. Kuwait says Iraq is lying, citing notonly Iraq's legacy of deceit but the testimony of repatriatedKuwaitis. Some say they were held with Kuwaiti detainees whoare still unaccounted for; others say that, before theirrelease, they were often shuffled from one prison to anotherto hide them from visiting Red Cross teams. They areconvinced Iraq continues to hide prisoners this way.   Kuwait's POW committee, a volunteer citizen group, isasking that the United Nations reinspect Iraq's prisons. &quot;Ifthe U.N. can send in teams to find hidden weapons then whycan't they send in teams to find our missing persons?&quot; asksMohammad al-Badah, a committee spokesman. U.N. andInternational Red Cross officials, too, suspect Iraq isholding Kuwaitis, perhaps to use as bargaining chips innegotiations over war reparations or other matters.   The U.N. could send prison-inspection teams into Iraq butneeds a formal request from the Kuwaiti government. Kuwaitsays it is deliberating such a request while pursuingprisoner releases on a number of other fronts.   But one U.N. official notes, the Iraqis have warned theKuwaitis that such a request would result in an Iraqi demandthat Kuwait and its Gulf War allies provide a list of Iraq'sown war dead, along with the location of their bodies. Butthe Allies violated U.N. covenants themselves by bulldozingtens of thousands of slain Iraqi soldiers into mass graveswithout attempting, as required, to identify them, says theU.N. official.   &quot;This is such a sensitive issue that the Kuwaitis dare notraise the prison issue because they fear the embarrassment itcould bring,&quot; the official adds.   Under international pressure to give a fuller accountingof the Kuwait missing, Iraq recently coughed up a list of3,300 names. But the Kuwaitis suspect that Iraq simply listedanyone in Iraq who wished to be sent to Kuwait. The list,therefore, is of self-proclaimed refugees, not detainees, andfew missing Kuwaiti citizens appear to be on it, Kuwaitcontends. Most are bedouins, the stateless, nomadic Arabs whoonce crossed freely along the Kuwait-Iraq border and whobecame stranded in postwar Iraq.   Kuwait, having accused many of its bedouins ofcollaborating with the Iraqis, sees them as a security threatand hasn't decided how many, if any, will be allowed backinto the country. Indeed, Kuwait itself has come undercriticism from human-rights groups for holding hundreds ofbedouins, all seeking readmission to the country, in asqualid refugee camp at the Kuwait border with Iraq.   For those with missing children, Emad al-Jasser amongthem, these mysterious political eddies only exacerbate theirgrief and helplessness. A mischievous child with a penchantfor soccer and computer games, Ahmed had been diagnosed withtuberculosis.   Kuwait's hospitals had been sacked. And as Ahmed's healthdeteriorated, his parents faced a tortuous decision. Thefamily had distant relatives in Baghdad who said they couldget him into a hospital there. Feeling they had no choice,his parents sent him off, accompanied by an aunt and a15-year-old cousin.   Mr. Jasser says he got a phone call that Ahmed had beenadmitted to the hospital. But a week later, allied bombsbegan to rain on Baghdad. &quot;We have heard nothing but rumorssince,&quot; he says.   One of the rumors is ominous: Ahmed and his guardians wereattempting to flee Iraq for Jordan after his 15-year-oldcousin, a girl, had become angry at Iraqi soldiers and hadscreamed epithets about Saddam Hussein. They were heading fora remote Iraqi-Jordanian border post but haven't been heardfrom since. Another rumor has it that they got into Jordan,but efforts to trace them proved fruitless.   Ahmed's mother is &quot;sick and broken -- she cries and feelsguilty about letting him go,&quot; says Mr. Jasser. And aninconsolable five-year-old sister, Hand, spends hours inimaginary conversation with her missing brother. &quot;What can wesay to her when we don't know anything ourselves?&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
