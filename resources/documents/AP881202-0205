The National Council of Savings Institutions, the smaller of thetwo lobbying groups, wants to abolish the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., which backs individual deposits of up to $100,000in Sandamp;Ls.   A proposal expected to be adopted by the council's board ofdirectors on Monday says healthy Sandamp;Ls should be permitted totransfer to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which guaranteesdeposits in commercial banks.   Sandamp;Ls that can't qualify for transfer would have five years tobecome healthy or shut down. In the end, only one federal insurancefund would remain, regulating both commerical banks and savingsinstitutions. There would no longer be institutions devotedexclusively to financing home mortgages.   That's the opposite of recommendations released Thursday by thelargest trade group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. Theleague wants to preserve the separate regulatory system for Sandamp;Ls andhousing finance.   The varied approaches are explained in part by differencesbetween their memberships. About two-thirds of the council's membersare called savings banks and are already insured by the FDIC. Mostof the rest have a good chance of qualifying for transfer. However,many of the league's members are not healthy enough to join the FDIC.   Both groups agree that the industry can't pay the $50 billion to$100 billion cost of cleaning up insolvent Sandamp;Ls and that Congressand the administration must find a way to pay.   The council said Congress must use tax money, but argued forkeeping Sandamp;L rescue spending exempt from Gramm-Rudman budget deficitrequirements. The league said it will offer its funding proposalearly next year.   While the league is emphasizing the need to maintain a separatelending system for housing, it also advised against a significantrollback of rules permitting Sandamp;Ls in some states to invest in riskyventures far removed from home mortage lending.   Instead, it advocates controlling abuses by requiring Sandamp;L ownersto put up more of their own money, or capital, when entering riskyventures.   ``When people have their own capital at risk, they tend to actmore responsibly,'' said Gerald J. Levy, president of GuarantySavings andamp; Loan Association in Milwaukee, who chaired the league taskforce on the issue.   Many analysts blame the industry's current problems in large parton institutions that strayed into speculative areas such as lendingto commercial real estate projects, particularly in states withpermissive laws, such as Texas, California and Florida.   The league said state-chartered Sandamp;Ls that used new investmentpowers wisely ``should not be penalized for the sins of those whohave abused'' them.   But Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House BankingCommittee and frequent critic of Sandamp;Ls, warned, ``The days are overwhen the federal government will provide insurance and then permit astate regulator to allow those insured deposits to be put intoanything under the sun.   ``Overall the U.S. League will get some sympathy in Congress whenthey say we shouldn't tax the healthy thrifts into oblivion,''Schumer said. ``But they're going to face far less sympathy whenthey resist the reform measures that are going to have to accompanytaxpayer dollars.''   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's3,000 federally insured Sandamp;Ls, proposed a risk-based capitalregulation on Monday that would be phased in by 1993.   While not addressing that specific proposal, the league said``provisions should be made where applicable for grandfathering,''meaning that some institutions should be exempted from meeting thenew requirements.   The league did advocate curbing the growth of insolventinstitutions, a measure already adopted by the bank board. Itrecommended tightening rules governing creation of new institutionsand takeover of existing Sandamp;Ls.   It also wants better standards for appraising the property thatsecures loans. It said Sandamp;Ls should be required to independentlyevaluate loans or parts of loans they purchase from otherinstitutions.</TEXT></DOC>
