The London-based human rights organization said Wednesday in itsannual report that it continued to receive complaints from Mexicoof arbitrary arrests and assassinations of members of groupsfrequently related to land disputes.   ``Many assassinations were attributed to civilian gunmen linkedto landowners but seemed to have the consent of the authorities,''the report said.   The Interior Ministry released a communique Thursday saying thegovernment expressed its ``absolute rejection'' of the allegations.   ``Amnesty International's mention of the existence of politicalprisoners in Mexico is unfounded,'' it said.   It also said the government made a detailed check of casesmentioned by Amnesty and found the cases were properly described byMexican police and judicial authorities as involving common crimes``without the influence of any kind of political situation.''   The ministry said Amnesty ``distributes reports without checkingthe facts and without an opportune presentation to the governmentof our country.''   Amnesty International said it was in communication with thegovernment by letter and visits by government representatives tothe organization.   Its annual report said at least 23 people adopted as ``prisonersof conscience'' by the organization remain in jail. Some of theprisoners have been sentenced for crimes such as robbery, assaultand homicide the report said but it added ``it seems these chargeswere imposed for political motives, for legal, peaceful activitiesas campesino or community leaders.''</TEXT></DOC>
