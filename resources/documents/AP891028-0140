A dusk-to-dawn curfew also is in place to guard against thethreat of arson during the three-day Devil's Night period thatbegins Sunday and ends Tuesday on Halloween.   In Tustin, Calif., a group urged pet owners to lock up theircats until Halloween is over, saying the animals are beingmutilated and tortured to death.   Several Southern California animal shelters also said they willnot give away black cats until Halloween is over, fearing theanimals may be killed or used as party novelties.   In Carbondale, Ill., police arrested 20 revelers as hundreds ofcollege students blocked a downtown street early Saturday morning,despite efforts to defuse the annual Halloween street party.   Most of the arrests were for alcohol violations and came afterabout 300 people left a private party and joined a large crowd inthe streets, authorities said.   The Devil's Night period, named after the nickname for the nightbefore Halloween, traditionally has been a time for pranks inDetroit. But it grew into a bout of arson that peaked in 1984 with810 fires that killed one person and left dozens homeless.   The number of fires in recent years has decreased steadily.There were 229 fires reported during the period last year, anaverage of 76 per night. About 65 fires are reported on an averagenight in Detroit, fire officials say.   ``I assume if we have the cooperation of the people of this city... we should be able to keep matters under control,'' MayorColeman A. Young said.   The City Council voted for a fifth consecutive year to impose a6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew on youths under 18 during the Devil's Nightperiod.   More police officers and firefighters will be on duty, and othercity workers, mayoral appointees and police cadets will patrolDetroit streets to ``serve as additional eyes and ears,'' Youngsaid.   Block club members and citizens band radio owners will comprisemany of the estimated 30,000 volunteers expected to assist policein patrol work.   The Cellular One telephone service will activate a toll-freenumber for reporting suspected arson during the three-day period.   The Detroit Fire Department will activate a hot line of its ownon Sunday. That program offers $1,500 for information leading tothe arrest and conviction of an arsonist.   City officials also hoped stepped-up demolition of abandonedbuildings would present arsonists with fewer potential targets.Nearly 2,000 such buildings have been torn down since July 1.</TEXT></DOC>
