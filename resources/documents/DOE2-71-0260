<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-0260 </DOCNO><TEXT>These instructions have been prepared as a reference guide for those personnelresponsible for the transmission of the data package to the WIPP. Forthose sites having automated data processing systems available for use,it should be understood that the shipper's computer system will be usedto place the information into the specified format for transmittal. Themethod of input will, of course, depend upon the particular system beingused. Prior to shipment, the shipper's computer system must retrievethe required information for all the packages in that shipment and writethe information to an IBM or IBM-compatible personal computer in thedata package format. The data package will then be transmitted in ASCIIformat over the specified communications system to the WIPP Waste InformationSystem (WWIS) using RLINK, which will be furnished by WIPP. Therefore,these instructions are primarily for use by data processing personnelto aid them in programming the system to provide the transmittal informationin the data package format. The method to input the data into the shipper'scomputer system should be determined through a joint effort between thewaste generator/shipper and the data processing personnel.</TEXT></DOC>
