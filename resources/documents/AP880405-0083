PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda today accusedopponents of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms of trying to bring backStalinism and told other publications that there are limits to whatthey should print.   In a major full-page article, the authoritative newspaper saidpapers should not print material that undermines Gorbachev'sefforts to reform the economy and to allow freer discussion of someissues.   Pravda said the Soviet Union needs people who are dedicated toimproving housing, food supplies and services, not people obsessedwith uncovering suspected enemies, as was Stalin.   ``A patriot is not he who cries out loudly about an alleged`internal threat' to socialism, who joining with a few politicalextremists seeks internal enemies everywhere,'' Pravda said.   ``A patriot is he who acts in the interest of the country, ofthe people, without fear of any difficulty,'' the newspaper said.   Pravda's article appeared to be an effort to strengthenGorbachev's hand going into an unusual June Communist Partyconference and an indication that the Soviet leader still facesstiff conservative resistance. The conference gives Gorbachev thepossibility of replacing opponents with his supporters tostrengthen support for his policies.   The article was written as a criticism of a letter by Leningradteacher Nina Andreyeva defending Stalin and published by thenewspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya on March 13.   The Soviet press in the last year has sharply criticizedStalin's excesses, and Gorbachev in November said the dictator'sguilt for the purges in which millions died was ``enormous andunforgivable.'' However, he defended Stalin's rapidindustrialization and collectivization of agriculture.   Pravda echoed Gorbachev's criticism, but said his opponentswon't let the issue rest either because they feel more comfortablewith Stalin's repressive ways or because it serves their personalinterest.   ``In one person this may be directed at taking more and givingless, in another in wrapping in respectable clothes their effortsto claim a monopoly in science, personal innocence or somethingelse,'' Pravda said.   It criticized Stalin's system as ``thoughtless execution oforders and suppression of initiative.'' It said the Soviet Unioncannot hide from the fact that ``many thousands'' of party workers,economic and military officials, scientists and cultural figureswere exiled or killed by Stalin.   Gorbachev embarked on ``perestroika'' _ his effort torestructure Soviet society _ at a meeting of the Central Committeein April 1985. Pravda said his opponents are concerned that thereforms will undermine the principles of the Soviet system.   ``Not all realize fully that the administrative-command methodshave exhausted themselves. All who pin hopes on those methods ortheir modifications would do well to wake up to the fact that wehave had that more than once, but it did not bring about thedesired results,'' Pravda said.   Pravda said the letter in Sovietskaya Rossiya was ``an attempt,little by little, to revise party decisions.''   ``At meetings at the party Central Committee it has been saidmore than once that the Soviet press is not a private shop and thatthe Communists writing in the press and the editors should be awareof their responsibility for the articles and the publications.''   ``In this case the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya ... hasdeparted from this principle,'' Pravda said.   It said the press should publish criticism that will helpsupporters of the restructuring to unite their forces, rather thanarticles that encourage disunity.</TEXT></DOC>
