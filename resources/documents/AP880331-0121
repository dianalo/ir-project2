The storm caused numerous minor accidents during the morningrush hour, giving motorists a longer-than-usual commute andcreating visibilities of near zero at times.   ``The roads will continue to be pretty nasty,'' said NationalWeather Service forecaster Mike Holzinger. ``I guess we would saythis is a worse-than-average storm. But we do get this kind ofweather in the spring.''   At Stapleton International Airport at Denver, crowded withtravelers for the Easter weekend, public affairs officer Norm Averywarned that delays of two hours or more could be expected.   The snow and gusting winds were expected to continue throughtonight, with as much as 20 inches of snow possible in Denver'swestern suburbs, Holzinger said. The weather service was callingfor total accumulations of up to 30 inches in the foothills.   Snow emergencies were declared for Douglas, Arapahoe and Adamscounties and for the city fo Fort Collins, where more than a footof snow had fallen, but the Colorado State Patrol said there wereno reports of serious accidents.   Stapleton officials said only the two main north-south runwayswere being used early today because of winds out of the north.Snowfall by 8 a.m. measured 8 inches at the airport, the weatherservice said.   Stapleton has about 650 departures and about an equal number ofarrivals daily, Avery noted. ``I would anticipate we'll see somecancellations today and greatly impaired traffic operations becauseof visibility,'' he said.   ``Our biggest problem is we can't plow visibility. The snow isnot the problem. It's the lack of visibility it creates that is theproblem,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
