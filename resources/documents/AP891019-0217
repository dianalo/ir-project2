It was the earliest snowfall on record for many cities,including Cincinnati, Dayton, Ohio, Indianapolis and St. Louis.   Snow also fell in portions of Kentucky, where a firefighter waselectrocuted by power lines downed by the snow.   At least one other death, in Ohio, was attributed to the storm.   In many places, the snow followed unusually balmy weekendweather in the upper 70s and low 80s.   ``I can't believe this,'' said Jan Fredbeck of Franklin, Ind.,where 6 inches of snow fell. ``We've got Halloween decorations upinside and they look so stupid now.''   Some 100,000 Cincinnati-area customers had power knocked out asthe wet, heavy snow piled up on leaf-laden trees, causing them tobreak and fall on power lines. Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric Co.spokesman Bruce Stoecklin said he expected service to be restoredby Thursday night.   About 20,000 Ohio Edison customers in the Akron-area wereaffected by outages but most had service restored by evening.Electricity was knocked out to more than 20,000 customers in theDayton area, but was restored to all but about 16,000 by evening,said Dayton Power andamp; Light Co. spokesman Allen Hill.   Toledo Edison Co. spokesman Jim Proctor said 19,000 customerslost electricity, but only 3,500 remained without power by Thursdaynight.   Schools were closed in much of the state as 3 to 5 inches ofsnow fell in southwestern Ohio and 1 to 3 inches of snow wasreported elsewhere in the state.   A Covington, Ohio, man was killed when his car veered into theopposite lane of a snow-slickened state highway and struck a pickuptruck near Dayton, said Patty Carey of the Ohio Highway Patrol. Thearea had received 4 inches of snow.   John Robinson, a National Weather Service forecaster, saidrecords dating back to about 1870 show no snowfall in Cincinnati asearly as Oct. 19. It was also an earliest snowfall record forDayton.   The snow that fell in most of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and partsof southern Michigan, eastern Missouri and Kentucky was caused by aCanadian cold front that met up with a storm system over theCarolinas, said Dennis Dixon of the National Weather Service in AnnArbor, Mich.   In Kentucky, up to 4 inches of snow fell, knocking out power toup to 100,000 customers stretched from Louisville to the state'snorthcentral and northeastern sections.   An assistant fire chief in Burlington, Ky., Donnie L.Kirkpatrick, 42, was electrocuted by felled power lines weigheddown by snow at a house where a fire was reported, said ClintonShields, deputy coroner in Boone County.   In Detroit, the 2.7 inches of snow that had fallen by earlyevening didn't set a record for early snowfall, but it did set onefor the heaviest for the month of October. The previous record hadbeen 1.4 inches on Oct. 19, 1930, said Bill Deedler, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service in Detroit.   Detroit Edison Co. spokesman Martin Bufalini said 41,500customers were without power.   A Consumers Power Co. spokesman blamed high winds and snow forknocking out power to 16,000 customers in Kalamazoo, Lansing andJackson in southern Michigan.   Indiana power customers suffered outages as well. Public ServiceIndiana, the state's largest utility, reported electricity wasknocked out to 6,000 customers, but service was restored to most ofthe homes and businesses later Thursday, said Pam Chapman, aspokeswoman for the Plainfield-based company that serves thestate's southern and central portions.   About 3,000 customers of Indiana andamp; Michigan Electric Co.,serving the northeastern part of the state, and Indianapolis Powerandamp; Light Co. lost power, but service was restored to most, spokesmensaid.   A snow advisory was in effect for all of Indiana until Friday.Up to 6 inches of snow had already accumulated over north-central,central and east-central Indiana, making it in one day the snowiestOctober on record.   Indianapolis' snowfall of up to 6 inches was the deepest onrecord since the weather service began keeping records in 1885,said meteorologist John Curran of the National Weather Service. Italso broke a record for the earliest measurable snow, set Oct. 20,1916.   Light snowfall was reported in the afternoon in the centralIllinois cities of Peoria and Springfield, with sleet in Chicago,the National Weather Service reported. Winds were gusting to 40 mphand temperatures were in the low to mid 30s. Up to 4 inches'accumulation was forecast for parts of Illinois.   Snow flurries in the eastern half of Missouri on Friday gave St.Louis its earliest snowfall on record. Like Indianapolis, it brokea record set Oct. 20, 1916.</TEXT></DOC>
