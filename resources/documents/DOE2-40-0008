The UMW-5PS will be manufacturedon a commercial scale by the Tychy Plant for Mine Electronics. The UMW-5PSmeter, consisting of the CPW/M ultrasonic converter, the USP controlsystem and the EMW electronic gauge, is installed on belt conveyors cooperatingwith bucket wheel excavators. The ultrasonic gauges measure thicknessof coal or minestones hauled by a belt conveyor. Belt speed and coallayer thickness is measured 25 times per second. Error in measuring coallayer thickness on the belt does not exceed 4%, data processing erroris below 1.4%. 1 ref.</TEXT></DOC>
