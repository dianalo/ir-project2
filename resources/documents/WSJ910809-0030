The move follows a refusal by an Illinois state court lastweek to enjoin Spalding Sports Worldwide, a unit of Eandamp;SHolding Co., from marketing its AirFlex baseball glove, whichReebok claims uses its air-pump technology to mold to thewearer's hand. Design Continuum helped Spalding develop theglove.</LP><TEXT>   Reebok said it filed suit last month against DesignContinuum in state court in Boston for breach of contract andconfidentiality obligations. It asked the court for apreliminary injunction to prevent Design Continuum frommaking &quot;continued disclosures of the technology before thetrial,&quot; said Jack Douglas, general counsel for the Canton,Mass., athletic shoe concern.   Gianfranco Zaccai, president of Design Continuum, said heis &quot;very confident&quot; the case will be dismissed. DesignContinuum, based in Boston, is a product design anddevelopment company.   In ruling against Reebok in the Spalding case, the judgesaid that a ban on Spalding, which has only about 8% to 10%of the $150 million U.S. glove market, wouldn't stop othersfrom obtaining the same technology from Design Continuum.Reebok said a suit against Spalding for unauthorized use ofconfidential information is still pending.   Reebok says that patents for its pump technology arepending.</TEXT></DOC>
