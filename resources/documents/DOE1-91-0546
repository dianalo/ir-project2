<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0546 </DOCNO><TEXT>Exploration of acoustic neurinoma, the most frequent benign tumor of posteriorfossa, now includes magnetic resonance imaging, and a C.G.R. supraconductorapparatus (0.5 Tesla) has been in use since March 1986. This equipmentprovides high resolution frontal sections, not only of posterior fossabut of the two pontocerebellar angles and even the contents of the twoIAC (thin, contiguous 4 mm sections in 256X256 matrix). A total of 43patients were examined. The neurinoma appears on the first echo as ahyposignal in relation to brain stem in sequences predominant in T1 andas a hypersignal in relation to peripontic CSF in sequences predominantin T2. Short sequences predominant in T1 (partial saturation or shortET and RT spin-echos) appear to be most effective for detection of acousticneurinoma. Comparison of MRI and CT scan imaging showed that firsty,all cases detected by conventional scanography were correctly analysedby MRI, with superiority for MRI for preoperative screening due to thefrontal sections obtained without interference and, secondly, the non-invasiveconfirmation of diagnosis in doubtful or negative cases requiring computerizedgaz meatocisternography. No false negative or false positive resultswere reported in our series or those documented in the literature usingthis new imaging technique, but high performance apparatus is necessary(thin sections and powerful principal magnetic field of at least 0.5Tesla). Improvements in this method could be obtained by the availabilityof more rapid programmes, the use of surface coils and the injectionof paramagnetic substances (gadolinium chelates) presently under study.NMR imaging is a reliable and non-invasive imaging method capable ofreplacing the scanner for study of acoustic neurinoma as soon as moreapparatuses become available.</TEXT></DOC>
