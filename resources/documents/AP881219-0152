The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insuresdeposits up to $100,000 in the nation's 3,000 Sandamp;Ls, is providingGolden West Financial Corp., one of the largest Sandamp;L holdingcompanies in the nation, with $91 million in cash. It also ispurchasing bad loans of the failed institutions for $29 million andguaranteeing Golden West against some future loss.   The FSLIC is receiving back 75 percent of the gains on some ofthe loans owned by the failed institutions _ Ohio Valley Savings andLoan Association, Steubenville, and First Border Savings Bank ofPiqua, which have $318 million in combined assets.   Also, Golden West is paying $8 million over three years to FSLICin exchange for tax benefits created by the deal. In addition, it ispumping $20 million into the acquired thrifts, whose six officesreopened Monday as branches of World Savings and Loan of Ohio.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the parent agency of the FSLIC,blamed the failure of Ohio Valley to losses on ``a large volume ofout-of-state commercial real estate loans and unsecured commercialloans.'' It attributed First Border's insolvency to ``excessivegrowth and speculation in financial futures markets.''   The bank board so far this year has ``resolved'' the cases of 159failed Sandamp;Ls, a post-Depression record, mostly through assistedmergers. Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall has said he wants tofinish another 40 cases in the next two weeks to take advantage ofexpiring tax breaks.</TEXT></DOC>
