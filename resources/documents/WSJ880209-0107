Bulkeley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> BOSTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   It snowed here last Thursday. And Boston, as usual, panicked.    Housewives jammed supermarkets to buy a week's worth of bread and milk. Motorists rushed to top off gas tanks. Schools bundled up children and sent them home early. Many offices closed.    By midafternoon, the snow had slowed to an occasional flurry. By 5 p.m. it had stopped. Streets and subway cars were empty. Boston, a Snow Belt city that ought to know better, had overreacted again.    Someone who moves here from Key West, Fla., or Los Angeles probably thinks Bostonians are heroic when it snows. But the overwhelming consensus among people transplanted here from other snowy places is that Bostonians are wimps.    &quot;I thought people here would be a little more hardy,&quot; sneers Lawrence D. Maloney, the editor of Design News magazine and a former Chicagoan. &quot;In Chicago, we laugh at this sort of thing.&quot; Alicia Russell, a college English teacher who recently moved here from Denver, was astounded when schools were let out at midday last week: &quot;It seemed ridiculous to me.&quot;    But Bostonians don't take chances on snowstorms. Not anymore. Especially on the 10th anniversary of the Great Snow.    On Feb. 6 and 7, 1978, what was expected to be a pretty big snowfall turned into a record-setting blizzard. In 32 hours the storm dumped 28 inches on the city and up to 40 inches in some suburbs. Gusts of up to 100 miles an hour built up eight-foot drifts.    The region was paralyzed. Deep snow from an earlier storm already blanketed the ground, leaving no place to put newly shoveled snow. Plows couldn't get through because drivers abandoned cars and trucks -- 3,000 on one nine-mile stretch of highway alone. Electricity failed for days in many areas. Altogether, 29 people died in New England, and the storm cost about $1 billion in damaged property, higher costs and lost production.    Gov. Michael Dukakis banned all unessential traffic in eastern Massachusetts for five days to give workers a chance to clean up. Army reserve units delivered food and medicine to hospitals by helicopter. Tens of thousands of stranded Bostonians took shelter for days in offices, schools, churches, even auto showrooms.    The city, and much of New England, was shut down for an entire week. New Yorkers recall where they were when the lights went out. Bostonians still talk about where they were when the blizzard hit.    Edward Stanger, a stranded Gillette Co. executive who lives in the suburb of Framingham, camped out in a 39th-floor office. After a power failure knocked out the elevators, he climbed up and down all those flights at mealtimes. Timothy J. Sullivan, who had just moved into a scantily furnished Back Bay apartment, huddled in a sleeping bag next to his gas stove for warmth and made phone calls in the dark for entertainment while subsisting on hard-boiled eggs for two days. But for many it was an adventure, cross-country skiing to the grocery store and meeting similarly trapped neighbors.    Ever since, Bostonians have acted as if every storm will be a repeat performance, though that's about as likely as Gov. Dukakis loosening his tie. Now the storm is part of the city's lore, like the molasses-tank collapse that drowned 21 people in 1919 and the Red Sox World Series failures. Says Michael Goldman, a political consultant: &quot;It was one of those moments that link together a generation.&quot;    Of course, other cities panic when a snowstorm approaches -- cities like Washington, Atlanta and Dallas. But Boston should be used to snow. It is among the snowiest big cities in the nation, with an average of 42 inches a year. That's half an inch less than Minneapolis, some 20% more than Chicago and 46% more than Detroit (though far behind Buffalo, which gets 75 inches a year).    Most Snow Belt cities handle snow with aplomb. School departments take pride in staying open. Buffalo's school calendar allows up to five snow days, but the city hasn't used any in the past two years. Minneapolis typically doesn't have any snow days. Denver went &quot;years and years without any&quot; before taking two last year, a school spokesman says. Boston, on the other hand, takes two to four snow days yearly -- not counting early closings.    Bostonians have excuses about why their snow is worse: The snow is often wet and slippery, making it harder to plow; narrow, winding roads, steep hills, numerous bridges and potholes make driving more treacherous.    But the main reason is the memory of the 1978 blizzard. Weather forecasters contribute to the problem because the quickest way for a weatherman to lose a job here is to underestimate another blizzard. Even though forecasters try to reassure viewers by promising that the coming storm won't approach the one in 1978, the mere mention of that storm conjures up a fearsome image in Beantowners' minds.    &quot;Ever since that time, people are very gun-shy,&quot; says Bruce Schwoegler, a local TV weatherman. &quot;As soon as people hear there's a little more than expected, they start thinking of 1978.&quot;    Moreover, most natives recall that forecasters didn't predict the magnitude of the '78 storm. Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that predictions are likely to vary. &quot;Boston TV weathermen are meteorologists,&quot; brags Thomas Chisholm, one of them. &quot;We all make our own forecasts. In New York, they mostly use the National Weather Service.&quot; As a result, Bostonians tend to dial-switch in search of the direst predictions.    For grocers, all this can be good for business. &quot;Before a storm, there's a sort of frenzy,&quot; says Stephen Murphy, the manager of a Salem, Mass., supermarket. &quot;Bread sales can rise by 50%.&quot; Stop andamp; Shop Cos., the largest supermarket chain in the region, says its managers have learned since the blizzard to stock up on bread, milk, candles and batteries when a storm is predicted.    Sometimes the anxiety itself makes things worse. During one heavy storm last winter, the mass exodus by workers let off early led to gridlock on the city's downtown streets. It took some motorists four to five hours to drive to their homes 10 miles in the suburbs. Now big companies coordinate staggered early-closing times, which helps a bit.    Public officials say they would rather be safe than sorry. Christopher Ianella, the city-council president, was acting mayor last Thursday. It was Mr. Ianella who urged businesses to close early, and he doesn't apologize. &quot;It's better to get people out of the city,&quot; he says, &quot;than to let them stay and get stuck.&quot;    He recalls that weather forecasters first underestimated the latest storm. When they started revising their predictions upward, visions of 1978 arose all over Boston. &quot;It was something serious,&quot; says Mr. Ianella -- the total accumulation turned out to be nine inches -- &quot;and I didn't want to get caught.&quot;    Neither did other residents who went through 1978. Charles Cuneo, a Newton, Mass., marketing executive, says he is likely to start shoveling even in the midst of a storm. &quot;Part of that,&quot; he says, &quot;is a residual feeling I'd better shovel while there is still a place to put the snow.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
