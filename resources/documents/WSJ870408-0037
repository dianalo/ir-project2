The agreement is expected to give new life to the technology, which was overtaken by so-called dry toner technology as the integral part of imaging and copying equipment in the late 1970s. The two companies licensed the new liquid toner technology, called Electroink, from Savin Corp., a copying machine company that developed a method that makes the use of liquid toners more economical than before.    Under the agreement between Du Pont and Xerox, the two companies said they will form a new jointly owned company called DX Imaging. It initially will employ about 200 people, and the companies are seeking to locate it in a high-technology &quot;corridor&quot; west of Philadelphia.    The companies said they already have invested $80 million in developing the technology and expect to invest an additional $40 million to support the project this year.    In Stamford, Conn., David Sadler, chairman of Savin, said the company last year licensed the liquid toner technology to Xerox for $28 million and to Du Pont for $9 million. Under the licensing agreements, Du Pont and Xerox can develop machines for high-speed copying, for color proofs, color printing, phototypesetting and engineering graphics. Savin said it licensed the technology to Ricoh Ltd. of Japan for the development of office copying machines, which Savin expects to market in the U.S., beginning in 1988.    A spokesman for Xerox, the Stamford-based office equipment and financial services company, said DX Imaging initially will use the new technology to produce color proofing and color printing machines.    In the 1970s, dry toner technology produced high-resolution images and products that were better than those produced by liquid toner products. But the dry powder also increased the cost of the machines and caused repair problems. The new liquid toner appears to produce equally sharp images and may do so in machines that can copy faster than those using the dry toner technology, a Xerox spokesman said.    Savin is a unit of Canada Development Corp., a Toronto-based Canadian government holding company. Du Pont is a Wilmington, Del.-based chemical products maker. </TEXT></DOC>
