South Florida Savings was a state-chartered stock association with $175.2 million in assets. It reported about $5 million in losses last year, according to the Florida state comptroller's office.    A Bank Board spokeswoman said the association's closing came as a result of losses on poorly underwritten loans and investments and high operating expenses, including excessive compensation of some former officers.    The new association will be known as South Florida Savings, a Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association and will begin operating Thursday, March 25. A new five-man board has been appointed. </TEXT></DOC>
