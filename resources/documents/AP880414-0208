Radio Moscow used only one sentence to sum up the consequencesof the pact for the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops deployed inAfghanistan.   ``It was agreed that the withdrawal of Soviet troops is to starton May 15, and to be completed within nine months,'' it said.   Other media reports, including state-run television's topevening news broadcast, made no reference to the pullout at all.   Instead, most reports emphasized that the goal of the pact isthe peaceful settlement of Afghanistan's 10-year-old civil war, andreiterated Soviet backing for the embattled Marxist government ofPresident Najib.   Most Soviets, however, would be aware of the implications of theaccords. Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has calledthe Afghan involvement his nation's ``bleeding wound,'' said lastweek that the pullout would begin in mid-May if the U.N.-brokeredGeneva negotiations were successful.   Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev sent troops into Afghanistan onDec. 27, 1979, to preside over the replacement of one Marxistleader by another.   They stayed on to help combat a nationwide insurgency in amilitary operation that has cost thousands of Soviet lives andbillions of rubles, sparked domestic dissent, and poisoned theKremlin's relations with other Moslem and Third World nations.   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, who was sent intointernal exile for almost seven years after criticizing theintervention, called the agreement signed in Geneva ``an enormousevent.''   ``It was a horrible war, a horrible mistake by the Sovietleadership that had awful consequences for the Afghan people,''said Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace laureate, who was reached bytelephone at his Moscow apartment.   ``I am waiting with great impatience for May 15 to see the troopwithdrawal begin,'' he added.   From the U.S. withdrawal of the SALT II arms control treaty andthe boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics by the United States and 61other nations to the canceling of grain and other trade agreementsinvolving foreign suppliers, the Soviets paid the price for sendingtanks and troops across the Afghan border.   A Moscow newspaper editor recently told a Western reporter ofreceiving a letter from a man whose only son was killed inAfghanistan. ``Now the others are coming home,'' the writer of theletter said. ``But what did my boy die for?''   The U.S. State Department has estimated Soviet casualties since1979 at 33,000-38,000, more than one-third of whom were killed.Those figures do not include ``heavy losses'' to disease, thedepartment said in a report issued in December.   The agreement signed by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadzeand U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz commits the Kremlin toending its military intervention.   State-run media's initial reporting on the Geneva agreementsseemed designed to assure Soviets that their government's statedgoal of achieving peace in Afghanistan's civil war had been met, atleast in part.   Shevardnadze, in a statement to reporters after the ceremony,spoke not of the withdrawal of Soviet troops but of the end to alloutside interference in Afghanistan mandated by the agreements.   ``The entire spectrum of possible activities and actions tomeddle in the affairs of Afghanistan has finally been blocked,'' hesaid, in remarks reported by the official Tass news agency andshown on Soviet TV.   ``Outside interference'' has been the term used by Soviets todescribe the aid by the United States and other countries toAfghanistan's anti-Marxist Mujahedeen insurgents.   Shevardnadze said he wanted to do ``justice'' to the U.S. rolein bringing about an Afghan settlement, but depicted the SovietUnion as the major peacemaker.   The Afghan pact, he said, ``has been predetermined by mycountry's policy of solving acute international problemsexceptionally by political means, which has been proclaimed byMikhail Gorbachev.''   ``Vremya,'' the evening news program, made no mention at allThursday night of the troop withdrawal.   The newcast, with an estimated audience of 150 million, beganwith reports on the regular Thursday meeting of the rulingPolitburo, the construction of an atomic icebreaker, and privatefarming plots in a region of the Russian federation.   About 20 minutes into the broadcast, ``Vremya'' showed aneight-minute report on what a correspondent in Geneva called a``historic event of exceptional international importance.''   Another newscaster on state-run TV also waxed eloquent inreporting the agreements, which were also signed by top diplomatsfrom Afghanistan and Pakistan.   ``Today in the World,'' an evening program, led off with ahighly unusual editorial comment from anchorman Igor Kudrin, whotold viewers, ``We begin today with news that we've been waiting solong for.''   On Feb. 8, Gorbachev said the future political system ofAfghanistan was ``none of our business,'' and stressed that theSoviet Union had dropped a previous condition that a coalitiongovernment be formed before the beginning of a military withdrawal.   Shevardnadze on Thursday reiterated Kremlin backing for Najib,saying what is crucial in Afghanistan is ``every kind of supportfor the success of the national reconcilation policy'' proclaimedlast year by the Afghan leader.</TEXT></DOC>
