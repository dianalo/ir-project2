The workstation is a departure for Xerox because it willbe built by Sun Microsystems Inc. around Sun's widelyavailable Sparc microprocessor, the executives said. Xerox,an office-products company based in Stamford, Conn., has soldonly proprietary workstations to run its well-regardedViewpoint software, used mainly for document-processing.Xerox will also introduce a new version of Viewpoint writtenfor Sun's version of the Unix operating system, an industrystandard.</LP><TEXT>   Industry executives said Xerox also will introduce a skeinof software packages intended to tie together the variouscomputers and programs used in most offices, in an attempt togive users of computer networks a consistent,easy-to-understand view of their work. Aside from Unix, itwill work with DOS and OS/2, the operating systems used bymost personal computers.   Xerox's new computing &quot;environment,&quot; while still tiltedtoward document-processing applications, will be presented asa systemwide approach similar to highly publicized productssuch as International Business Machine Corp.'s OfficeVisionor Hewlett-Packard Co.'s New Wave, the executives said.   The company is likely to promote its reputation as theoriginator of many of the innovations in these packages, andthus the most natural provider of software that exploitsthem. A Xerox spokeswoman declined to comment on today'sannouncement, which will be made in San Francisco.   On Oct. 2, Xerox is expected to announce a largemultifunction copier-printer that will hook up with thecompany's new products as well as a host of other hardwareand software products. That machine also will have scanningand facsimile capabilities, and is expected to play a largepart in Xerox's push into office computing systems.</TEXT></DOC>
