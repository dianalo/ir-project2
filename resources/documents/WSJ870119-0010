Egypt's position means that the issue of military debts will continue to plague Egyptian-American relations, which already are severely strained by the Reagan administration's secret arms sales to Iran. U.S. officials had hoped their debt-relief plan would remove a nettlesome side issue and illustrate Washington's ability to work with Egypt and other moderate Arab states despite Arab bitterness over the Iranian affair.    But Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak indicated over the weekend that he hasn't accepted America's debt-relief proposals, and he made clear that he had expected more generous terms. &quot;Until now, I could say that my expectations from the U.S. haven't been met, and I refused all the proposals which were offered by the American administration so far,&quot; Mr. Mubarak said in an interview with the Al Ittihad newspaper of the United Arab Emirates. In the interview, which was reprinted in Egypt's government-owned newspapers, Mr. Mubarak also said that Egyptian experts &quot;are still looking for a solution to this problem.&quot;    Prompted largely by Egypt's worsening economic situation, the Reagan administration last month proposed a plan to ease the terms on military loans made to Egypt and 37 other countries under the American foreign military sales program. Because many of the loans were made years ago, they carry interest rates far higher than today's market rates.    The plan gives debtor countries two options to ease their repayment burdens. Under one, countries could simply pre-pay the loans ahead of time without penalty, thereby avoiding future interest payments.    Such an option isn't feasible for Egypt, a cash-strapped country that couldn't hope to scrape together enough money to pay back at once the $4.6 billion it owes on American military loans.    Under the second option, the U.S. offered to reduce the original interest rates on loans, which in Egypt's case run as high as 14%, to current market rates of about 7%. But the interest payments wouldn't be forgiven. Rather, they simply would be delayed until the end of the 25-year loans. Further, Egypt would have to pay interest accrued on the deferred payments.    The net result is that Egypt would face a huge balloon payment when the loans mature early next century; bankers and diplomats who have studied the plan say Egypt's balloon payment could amount to some $10 billion.    The American plan would provide some immediate relief for Egypt by lowering its current annual interest payments to $350 million from $540 million. But it falls far short of the debt forgiveness or simple interest write-down Egypt has been seeking for months.    In the interview, Mr. Mubarak complained that &quot;the only solution which the American administration proposed to this problem is to postpone paying half the interest rate until the original debt is fully paid. But I am looking to the future. I don't want the American administration to reduce the interest rate for just two or three years (or) until I am out of office, and then a crisis happens.&quot;    One Egyptian official explained privately that Mr. Mubarak was &quot;rejecting the ballooning of payments,&quot; but added that other approaches were being discussed with the U.S. A Western diplomat familiar with the issue said Egyptians &quot;haven't made any secret of the fact they aren't happy with aspects&quot; of the American plan.    Under one other approach that had been discussed in Washington and Cairo, private banks would loan Egypt the money to pay off its military loans immediately. Egypt then would repay the banks over time at current commercial interest rates, which are far lower than the rates Egypt is paying to the U.S. government. But that proposal apparently has been dropped because banks would insist on American government guarantees that Egypt would pay back the money, which the Reagan administration isn't willing to provide.    Mr. Mubarak, America's closest ally in the Arab world, also dished out over the weekend some unusually harsh criticism of the U.S. over its secret arms sales to Iran. The Egyptian president, who has staunchly supported Iraq in its war against Iran, said in his interview that because of the secret arms deals, &quot;America has totally lost credibility in the Arab region and maybe in the whole world.&quot;    He asserted that the U.S. must make &quot;major efforts&quot; to restore its credibility, and said he wouldn't make a planned visit to the U.S. until the controversy over the Iranian sales clears up. </TEXT></DOC>
