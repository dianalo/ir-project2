The results are compared withdata reported for Ni/sub 60/Nb/sub 40/ glass to ascertain the effectsof Cr addition. Crystallization temperature and activation energy forcrystallization of Ni/sub 55/Cr/sub 5/Nb/sub 40/ glass are less thanthat of the binary alloy. Annealing embrittlement is observed in theternary glass, however, ductile-brittle transition temperature is reducedby Cr. Hardness increases on annealing and follows a behaviour similarto that of embrittlement. Kinetic studies of annealing embrittlementand stress relaxation yield activation energies for structural relaxation.These values are smaller than for Ni/sub 60/Nb/sub 40/.</TEXT></DOC>
