Winter (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO EMI IND MON </IN><TEXT>   A reviving U.S. machine tool industry, bolstered by a 57% rise in July orders, puts its latest technology on display in Chicago next week. And for the first time this decade, industry executives won't have to fake enthusiasm as they greet prospective customers.    The resurgence in demand for U.S. machine tools is likely to last at least through 1989 if the dollar doesn't climb much further, many economists and industry executives say. The demand is buoyed by the general health of U.S. manufacturing industry, which would be undermined if U.S. goods again became overpriced because of a strong dollar.    The International Machine Tool Show, which opens Sept. 7, will feature $315 million of state-of-the-art manufacturing technology from 1,181 companies and 28 countries. Before it closes Sept. 15, the show will be seen by 100,000 managers and engineers from around the world and may ring up $1 billion in sales, according to its sponsor, the National Machine Tool Builders' Association.    &quot;We expect a lot more customer interest this year than we had at the shows two years and four years ago,&quot; says Daniel J. Meyer, president of Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the largest U.S. machine tool producer.    Machine tools are complex machines that shape most metal parts, and the industry's recovery is vital to restoring U.S. prowess in durable goods manufacturing. Machine tools range from lathes and milling machines to metal-forming presses.    U.S. machine tool makers, fighting back from the 1981-82 recession and the major inroads made by foreign competition as the dollar soared in the mid-1980s, received $256.3 million of orders last month, the industry association said. That compared with $163 million a year earlier.    July's orders were down 33% from June's $382.8 million. However, the June bookings were the highest for any month since mid-1980, and many machine tool plants as well as factories using machine tools close for vacations in July.    For the first seven months of 1988, orders totaled $2.07 billion, an 80% jump from $1.15 billion a year earlier.    Machine tool export orders, meanwhile, have risen 76% this year from the like 1987 period.    With U.S. exports of manufactured goods now soaring and imports slowing, investment in new factory equipment is running high. Adrian T. Dillon, chief economist for Eaton Corp., says U.S. business spending on all types of machinery and equipment will rise more than 13% this year and 7% to 8% next year.    And the spending boom, he says, has finally spread to machine tools and other production machinery. Earlier in the current boom, U.S. companies were buying mainly computers, telecommunications equipment and other potentially cost-saving electronic devices.    &quot;We're seeing more serious activity in plant expansion and modernization than we've had at any other time in the 1980s,&quot; says Edson I. Gaylord, chairman and chief executive officer of Ingersoll Milling Machine Co., Rockford, Ill. &quot;Caterpillar, Ford Motor, the aircraft manufacturers and a whole lot of other companies are planning major projects to make their operations more efficient.&quot;    &quot;There's a confidence level among our customers that we haven't seen in quite a while,&quot; says James R. Roberts, vice president, world-wide sales and marketing, for Giddings andamp; Lewis, Fond du Lac, Wis., a unit of Amca International Corp. &quot;They are looking for a good level of business in their own products and are willing to invest in production equipment.&quot;    So far, however, the order gains haven't greatly helped machine tool makers' profits. Prices continue to be held down by competition, although there's less discounting than there was a year ago. And because of the time required to engineer and produce the machines, shipments don't yet reflect the order upturn. July's shipments of $188.3 million were 4.8% below the 1987 month, the industry group said, and shipments for the first seven months were down 2.5%.    Eli S. Lustgarten, a machinery analyst with PaineWebber Inc., says the industry won't see higher profits until next year. He isn't recommending the companies' stocks, he says, because &quot;they never got cheap enough to reflect the full extent of the industry's problems.&quot;    However, he says, U.S. machine tool builders are making headway against those problems. They are slashing operating costs, partly by adopting new manufacturing methods.    Cincinnati Milacron, for instance, expects to save $45 million annually by mid-1989 from a restructuring involving a &quot;focus factory&quot; concept. This means each factory would become a profit center producing one type of machine. Litton Machining andamp; Assembly Systems, a Warren, Mich., unit of Litton Industries Inc., is cutting costs 10% a year by consolidating operations, cutting its salaried payroll and other measures, William Bournias, the unit's president, says.    In addition, U.S. producers are offering better machines after allowing some of their products to fall behind technologically. They're also working to improve reliability and service, areas where Japanese and European producers gained a lead early in the decade.    Finally, producers have become more successful in selling manufacturing cells and systems. These groups of machines under computer control were introduced in the late 1970s but weren't widely accepted until recently, partly because initial performance wasn't satisfactory.    The heightened interest in cells and systems helps U.S. machine tool builders, who are in a better position to work closely with their domestic customers in assembling and operating complex manufacturing systems than foreign machine tool builders are.    As one illustration, Litton is working with Navistar International Corp. on production equipment for a new truck engine that is still being designed, Mr. Bournias says. Simultaneous engineering of the engine and the production system will reduce capital costs, improve efficiency and result in a better engine, he says.    As always in the capital goods industry, there are threats to machine tool makers' emerging prosperity. Some industry executives' biggest concern is the recent rebound of the dollar. A continued climb in the dollar, sparked by rising U.S. interest rates, could weaken exports, undermine capital investment and intensify competition from foreign machine tool makers.    Even with the dollar at current levels, competition from foreign-made machines remains intense, and a growing number of foreign machine tool makers are opening U.S. plants.    In addition, there's the risk of a new recession in late 1989 or 1990, which could be triggered by a post-election tax increase, soaring interest rates or both.    Although U.S. machine tool makers probably wouldn't be hurt as badly by a 1989-90 downturn as they were in the 1981-82 recession, they'd still be hurt. Many are in the midst of restructuring efforts, and few have had time to rebuild their depleted balance sheets.    ---                   July 1988       June 1988      July 1987 Comparative new orders for metal-cutting machines: Domestic ..... $167,800,000    $210,650,000    $84,600,000 Foreign ........ 19,500,000      27,700,000     17,500,000   Total ....... 187,300,000     238,350,000    102,100,000   7-month total for 1988: $1,530,050,000; for 1987: $767,500,000.
