Subsection (b)is amended to allow ``reduction of leaves on the premises on which theyfall by the person in control of the premises, unless prohibited by localordinance and/or regulation'' in counties whose total population, as listedin the most recent census, exceeds 65,000. This burning is to be done between10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., whenever feasible. EPA is approving this portionof the regulation because Georgia has provided adequate demonstration thatambient air quality standards will not be jeopardized. Subsection (d) isamended to limit smoke opacity, ``except for a reasonable period to geta fire started,'' to 40 percent opacity rather than andplusmin;2 of the Ringelmannchart from any source of open burning referred to in subsections (a) and(b) of this rule. Opacities of andplusmin;2 of the Ringelmann chart and 40percent opacity are equivalent. This amendment is necessary to update measurementtechniques. Therefore, EPA approves the change in subsection (d).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>This action will be effective October 11, 1988, unlessnotice is received within 30 days of publication that adverse or criticalcomments will be submitted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the State submittal for this action are availablefor public inspection during normal business hours at:<ITAG tagnum="15">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV, Air Programs Branch,345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Georgia Department of Natural Resources, 205 Butler Street SE., FloydTowers East, Atlanta, Georgia 30334</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Public Information Reference Unit, Environmental Protection Agency,401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Gregg M.

These regulatorychanges were addressed in a public hearing on April 19, 1985, after whichthey became State-effective on May 27, 1985. That submittal also includedamendments to Georgia rule 391-3-1-.02, Section (5) entitled ``Open Burning''which are being approved today.Subsection (b) of Georgia Rule 391-3-1-.02, Section (5) is being amendedto allow ``reduction of leaves on the premises on which they fall by theperson in control of the premises, unless prohibited by local ordinanceand/or regulation'' in counties whose total population, as listed in themost recent census, exceeds 65,000. Prior to this amendment, burning ofthis sort was not allowed in counties whose total population exceeded 65,000.EPA's review of this amendment raised several points: (1) The total amountof particulate matter emitted from leaf burning will increase if more leaveswill be burned; (2) the particulate emitted per county may likewise increasedue to the greater population of these counties (arguably, more residentsmean more leaves raked and burned than in less populous counties); (3)the increased leaf burning may impact other areas; (4) there is no demonstrationthat monitors presently showing attainment in counties without open burningwill continue to do so once leaf burning is allowed. It stands to reasonthat the likelihood of a threat to ambient standards and public healthand welfare will increase as a result of this rule change. In view of thesefacts, EPA informed the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD)that it would be necessary for EPD to submit a demonstration showing thatthe revision would not jeopardize the attainment status of these areas.Since the open burning of leaves is of a seasonal nature, it was determinedthat the short-term ambient particulate standard, rather than the annualstandard would be the critical standard in any demonstration. On February19, 1988, Georgia EPD submitted a modeling demonstration using the ISCSTmodel of UNAMAP VI. The modeling results clearly showed that the short-termNAAQS for particulate matter would be protected. In light of EPA's revisionof the particulate matter standard on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634), a modelingdemonstration was done to show that the standards were protected for PM<T2>10</T2> (particulate matter with a nominal diameter of 10 micrometersor less). Modeling the open burning of a pile of leaves using the conditions andassumptions agreed upon in meetings between EPA's Regional Office and Georgia'sEPD yields a total concentration of 67.85 andCx.18;g/m3 for total suspendedparticulate (TSP) and 56.86 andCx.18;g/m3 for PM<T2>10</T2>. These concentrations are well within the 24-hour NationalAmbient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for TSP and PM<T2>10</T2> of 150 andCx.18;g/m3. Subsection (d) of Georgia Rule 391-3-1-.02, Section (5) is being amendedto limit smoke opacity, ``except for a reasonable period to get a firestarted,'' to 40 percent opacity rather than andplusmin;2 of the Ringelmannchart from any source of open burning referred to in subsections (a) and(b) of Georgia Rule 391-3-1.02 Section (5). Opacities of andplusmin;2 ofthe Ringelmann chart and 40 percent opacity are equivalent. This amendmentmerely updates measurement techniques. There will be no environmental impactfrom this amendment. For further information on this action, the reader may examine a TechnicalSupport Document at the EPA Regional Office whose address is listed above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action </ITAG>EPA is approving the previously discussed amendments to Georgia rule 391-3-1.02,Section (5), subsections (b) and (d). No adverse impact on the air, includingair quality, is expected. EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective October 11, 1988 unless, within 30 days ofits publication, notice is received that adverse or critical comments willbe submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective October11, 1988. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review mustbe filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuitby October 11, 1988. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements.
