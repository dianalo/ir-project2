DPR-80 and DPR-82,issued to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for operationof the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively,located in San Luis Obispo County, California.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment  </ITAG>Identification of Proposed Action  The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications (TS)by revising the steam generator low and low-low level setpoints for initiatinga reactor trip. Specifically, the proposed amendments would change theDCNPP combined Technical Specifications by revising TS 2.2.1, ``ReactorTrip System Instrumentation Setpoints,'' Table 2.2-1, ``Reactor Trip SystemInstrumentation Trip Setpoints,'' Items 13 and 14. These Items would bemodified to reduce the steam generator water level low and low-low setpointsfrom 15 percent to 7.2 percent, as indicated by the narrow range instrument.Also, the associated TS bases would be changed accordingly.  The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application amendmentsdated April 18, 1988.  The Need for Proposed Action  The proposed revision to the TS is required to decrease the number of unnecessaryreactor trips caused by (1) steam generator water level low-low and (2)steam generator water level low, coincident with steam/feedwater flow mismatch.This will reduce the number of challenges to the reactor protection systemsand impose fewer thermal transients on the plants.  Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action  The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision tothe TS. The evaluation shows that the proposed revision (1) does not increasethe probability or consequences of accidents, (2) does not result in achange in the types or amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite,and (3) does not result in a significant increase in the individual orcumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commissionconcludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiologicalenvironmental impact.  With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed revisionto the TS involves systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents andhas no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendments.  The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 23, 1988 (53 FR 23708). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice. Alternative to the Proposed Action  Since the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.  The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin unnecessary reactor trips, thereby increasing the number of challengesto the reactor protection systems and imposing more thermal transientson the plants.  Alternative Use of Resources  This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to the Diablo Canyon NuclearPower Plant dated May 1973, and its Addendum, dated May 1976.  Agencies and Persons Consulted  The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact  </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendments. Based upon the foregoing environmentalassessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significanteffect on the quality of the human environment.
