Gets   Order by China   For 33 Aircraft   ---   Value Is Put at $2 Billion;   Chinese Take Options   For an Additional 36   ----   By Rick Wartzman   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/01/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><CO>   BA FREST UTX F.CFM GE U.RR</CO><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)AIRLINES (AIR)</IN><LP>   China's Civil Aviation Administration ordered 33 BoeingCo. airplanes valued at $2 billion and took options on 36others, marking the second big booking for the world's No. 1jet maker in the past week.   &quot;It seems like the good orders just won't stop,&quot; saidJerry Cantwell, an aerospace analyst who followsSeattle-based Boeing for Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. &quot;It seemslike the stock won't stop going up either.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, Boeing shares closed in composite trading on theNew York Stock Exchange yesterday at $82.375, up 37.5 cents.   The stock had climbed more than a point earlier in theday, but it fell back as the entire market retreated. Mr.Cantwell noted that details of the Chinese order weren'tdisclosed until just minutes before the final bell, meaningthe Big Board might not have had time to react to the latestgood news. Boeing's high for the past 52 weeks is $82.75,reached last week.   The firm orders consist of five 747-400 four-enginejumbo-jets, which cost about $130 million apiece; one747-200F freighter; four 767 wide-bodies; 10 757narrow-bodies; and 13 737-300 twinjets.   The aviation authority oversees the purchasing of planesfor China's airlines, and the aircraft ordered will be usedby Air China, Guangzhou CAAC, China Southwest Airlines andother carriers.   The agency has picked PW4000 engines, a new, powerfulmodel made by United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitneyunit, to propel the 747-400s and 767s. And a Pratt andamp; WhitneyJT9D-7R4G2 will be used on the freighter. That order isvalued at about $250 million.   Rolls-Royce engines were tapped for the 757s, and enginesmade by CFM International, a joint venture of GeneralElectric Co. and Snecma of France, will be used on the737-300s.   Although Boeing has, as a matter of policy, ceasedproviding delivery dates for its planes, Pratt andamp; Whitney saidthe first aircraft will begin being shipped to Air China inthe first quarter of 1992. That is earlier than when manyother Boeing customers are set to receive their jets, andthere has even been some speculation that Boeing earlier thisweek lost a Mexicana Airlines order to rival Airbus Industriebecause its delivery schedule is stretched so far.   Boeing has been negotiating seriously with the Chinese forthe past eight months, and the company said the purchase ofthe 69-plane package had nothing to do with President Bush'sdecision last week to renew most-favored trade status withthat country. Outside experts concurred, explaining that sucha designation is designed to give China low tariffs on itsexports to the U.S.   It wasn't immediately clear how many other companies werein the running for the Chinese order. McDonnell Douglas Corp.has a good relationship with the nation, whose airlines haveordered MD-11 tri-jets in the past and which actuallyassembles some MD-80s in Shanghai.   A spokesman at McDonnell Douglas's transport aircraftdivision in Long Beach, Calif., said he didn't know whetherthe firm had actively bid against Boeing for the latestorder. But one source said the company may not have been &quot;ina particular campaign on this one.&quot;   Boeing, for its part, stressed its own longstandingrelationship with the Chinese. Since 1972, the nation haspurchased 101 Boeing airplanes, including three additional757s last October.   The company's orders for the year for all models now standat 187 valued at about $16.2 billion. Only a week ago, JapanAirlines ordered 20 747-400s valued at $3.1 billion andplaced options for 34 others.</TEXT></DOC>
