ADLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Couples unable to bear children can contract for asurrogate mother as long as the agreement does not provide money toa woman for giving up her parental rights, a judge ruled Monday.   The American Civil Liberties Union said the ruling by WayneCounty Circuit Judge John Gillis was confusing but apparently meanssome surrogate contracts are valid in Michigan, where the nation'smost active surrogacy lawyer practices.   The ACLU had sought to have the state law against pregnancy forpay overturned, but Gillis reaffirmed his Sept. 19 finding that thelaw was constitutional.   ``This court,'' he wrote, ``finds that the Michigan Legislatureintended to prohibit all surrogate arrangements where the surrogatemother is compensated (other than actual medical expenses as aresult of the pregnancy) and agrees to voluntarily relinquish herparental rights to the child.   ``It is important to note that individuals may still legallyenter into surrogate arrangements where there is no compensationpaid to the mother (other than actual medical expenses). All othersituations must be decided on a case-by-case basis.''   Howard Simon, executive director of the Michigan ACLU, said hewants to have Gillis' order clarified.   ``I don't think it gives much guidance,'' he said. ``It doesappear, however, that he is adopting the interpretation that both weand the attorney general agreed upon.   ``It appears to have allowed us to accomplish what we wanted toaccomplish,'' he said. ``There are many, many couples for whom asurrogate parenting arrangement is the only realistic option tostart a family.''   At the Sept. 19 hearing, Assistant Attorney General Vincent Leonesaid the statute prohibited any surrogate contract that includedmoney being paid in exchange for the woman giving up parental rightsto the child.   Leone said the law does not address a woman's right to act as asurrogate or receiving money for carrying the child.   Simon said if Gillis agreed with that interpretation, the rightto enter a surrogate contract still exists in Michigan.   ``The legal issue is, `Can you require a surrogate mother tosurrender her parental rights? Can you pay a surrogate mother togive up the child she bore?''' Simon said.   ``That's baby-selling. That's what should be prohibited by law.You can never require a woman to relinquish her parental rights. Thepayment has got to be for something else.''   Gillis said the ACLU and other plaintiffs trying to have thestate law overturned ended any controversy when they agreed inSeptember that the law was constitutional.   Noel Keane, a Dearborn attorney who arranges surrogacy contractsbetween women willing to carry a child and couples unable toconceive, said he expected Gillis' ruling to be appealed.   Keane said he is serving about 200 couples with surrogatecontracts enacted in states such as New York and Nevada that allowsurrogate parenting for pay.   Typically, infertile couples pay $10,000 to be matched with awould-be mother. They pay another $10,000 to the woman who agrees tobe artificially inseminated, carry the child, then give up custody.</TEXT></DOC>
