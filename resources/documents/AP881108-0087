The United States has prosecuted at least 46 cases of armssmuggling or attempted arms smuggling to Iran since 1981, when thecountry's 8-year war with neighboring Iraq began.   Ahmad Modarressi, 64, was sentenced Monday to 14 months in prisonand his son, Majid, 30, to six months in prison by U.S. DistrictJudge Mark L. Wolf.   The judge said mitigating factors included the elder Modarressi'sbelief that the U.S. government was interested in improvingrelations with Iran.   But Wolf characterized the younger Modarressi as ``extremelynaive, perhaps more accurately described as extremely stupid.''   ``The circumstances do tend to diminish the moral culpability ofthe defendant, though not his legal culpability,'' Wolf said. ``Thepreconceived notion of the type of person who would engage ininternational arms smuggling fits a certain profile. This profilehad very little to do with Majid Modarressi.   ``The defendant Majid Modarressi's stupid behavior in this casereached a level I've never encountered in criminal matters. By theend of the case, he seems more like a cartoon character than amenace to society.''   Among the son's gaffes, Wolf said, were suggesting a $60 millionillegal deal over the telephone to an unknown Raytheon Co. worker,not knowing what a TOW antitank missile was and inquiring aboutStinger anti-aircraft missiles simply because he had heard themmentioned in a TV news report about Afghanistan.   Wolf said the elder Modarressi had a fuzzy understanding of theIran-Contra scandal and the trip to Tehran reportedly made by formerNational Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.   ``I am influenced by the fact that he apparently had the honestbelief that while export of these arms was illegal, the UnitedStates wanted to sell these arms to Iran to open channels forexports to that country,'' the judge said.   Ahmad Modarressi's sentence includes 10 months he has alreadyserved. He is an Iranian national and could be deported after hisrelease.   Majid Modarressi's sentence is 189 days, the amount of time hehas already served. He will be required to perform 500 hours ofcommunity service in Cincinnati, where he has been an unemployedarchitect and has an American wife and 4-year-old daughter.   The father and son were accused of violating the U.S. Arms ExportControl Act by attempting to buy microwave tubes for the radar ofthe Hawk anti-aircraft missile system and sell them to Iran.   The elder Modarressi pleaded guilty during their trial and hisson was convicted Oct. 26 after a 19-day trial.   The case stemmed from a 10-month investigation in which a CustomsService agent posed as an employee of Raytheon, the Lexington-basedfirm that makes the Hawk system, and recorded conversations with theModarressis.   Although a truce in the Iran-Iraq war was announced Aug. 20, U.S.officials said Iran has maintained its effort to obtain spare partsfor its military hardware, the bulk of which was bought from theUnited States by the American-backed government of the shah beforethe 1979 Islamic revolution.</TEXT></DOC>
