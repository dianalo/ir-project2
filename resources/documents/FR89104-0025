The Statute.</T3> This rule implements that portion of section 8(d)(2)of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the 1937 Act) that concerns theattachment of Section 8 assistance to existing structures that have beenrehabilitated. Section 208 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Actof 1983 (HURRA) (Pub. L. 98-181, approved November 30, 1983) amended section8(d)(2) to permit the attachment of assistance to an existing structureonly if (1) the owner agrees to rehabilitate the structure other than withassistance under the 1937 Act, and (2) HUD and the PHA approve the attachment.Section 102(a)(6) of the Housing and Community Development Technical Amendmentsof 1984 (the Technical Amendments Act) (Pub. L. 98-479, approved October17, 1984) further amended section 8(d)(2) to clarify that the 1983 amendment's``conditions for tying the assistance to a particular structure or projectdo not apply to the circumstances under which HUD provides Section 8 existingassistance in connection with loan management property disposition, orconversion from other assistance programs to project-based subsidies administeredby HUD nor do they apply to the Section 8(e) moderate rehabilitation program.''(H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1103, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 22-23 (1984)). The activitiesenumerated in the Conference Report describe situations where the Departmentwas attaching Section 8 existing housing assistance to structures beforethe HURRA limitations were imposed. To date, the Department has not authorizedthe attachment of Section 8 existing housing assistance for other purposes,and thus the limitation on attachment of Section 8 assistance added byHURRA has not been triggered.Section 148 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-242, approved February 5, 1988 (HCD Act of 1987)) further amendedsection 8(d)(2) to require the Secretary to permit a PHA to approve attachmentof no more than 15 percent of the assistance provided by the PHA, subjectto meeting the statutory rehabiliation requirements.Section 8(d)(2) was further amended by section 1005 of the Stewart B. McKinneyHomeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-628, approved November7, 1988) (1988 McKinney Act)). Section 1005(a) directs the Department toissue regulations that take effect not later than 30 days after date ofenactment of the 1988 McKinney Act to implement the amendment made by section148 of the HCD Act of 1987 (redesignated as section 8(d)(2)(A) of the 1937Act). The Department was unable to meet the December 7th statutory publicationdeadline, as a result of issues arising out of the collections of informationin this rule. In accordance with section 1005(a), however, the Department,pending effectiveness of this rule, has been ready to consider applicationsreceived from PHAs to attach Certificate Program assistance to structures,and to approve applications that met the statutory requirements.Section 1005(b)(1) of the 1988 McKinney Act adds a new subparagraph (B)to section 8(d)(2) of the 1937 Act to permit attachment of assistance toa newly constructed structure (Section 1005(b)). This amendment is notimplemented by this rule. The Department intends to implement this provisionin a regulation to take effect within 90 days after enactment of the 1988McKinney amendments, in accordance with section 1005(b)(2).Section 8(d)(2)(A), as amended by the sections referred to above, readsas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(2)(A) Each contract for an existing structure entered into underthis section shall be for a term of not less than one month nor more thanone hundred and eighty months. <T3>Where the Secretary enters into an annual contributions contract witha public housing agency pursuant to which the agency will enter into acontract for assistance payments with respect to an existing structure,the contract for assistance payments may not be attached to the structureunless (i) the Secretary and the public housing agency approve such action,and (ii) the owner agrees to rehabilitate the structure other than withassistance under this Act and otherwise complies with the requirementsof this section, except that the Secretary shall permit the public housingagency to approve such attachment with respect to not more than 15 percentof the assistance provided by the public housing agency if the requirementsof clause (ii) are met. </T3>(The pertinent text is in italic.)</ITAG>The 1987 Act amendment is derived from section 149(b) of H.R. 4, 100thCong., 1st Sess. (1987), which differed from the enacted provision onlyin the applicable percentage (25 percent rather than 15 percent). The accompanyingReport of the Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs (H. Rep.No. 122, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1987)) describes the purpose of theamendment as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Sec. 149(b) of the bill enables the Secretary to permit public housingagencies to attach up to 25 percent of the Sec. 8 assistance they provideto specific properties, provided that the owners rehabilitate the properties.The Committee has added this authority for the express purpose of facilitatingthe use of Sec. 8 Certificates in connection with projects which, whenmatched with the value of Sec. 8 Existing Certificates, would be able toprovide decent, affordable housing to very low income people. The Committeeis especially interested in seeing this authority used to provide Sec.8 Certificates for properties which are rehabilitated or constructed usingthe low-income housing tax credit, and in properties developed as limited-equity,low income cooperatives. In both cases, owners can more easily developeconomically feasible projects for very low income occupancy if they canbe assured of the availability of Sec. 8 rental assistance for the verylow income tenants. The Committee expects HUD to implement this provisionas quickly as possible, and to encourage its use by PHAs for these purposes.</ITAG><T3>B. Justification for Interim Rule. </T3>It is Department policy toimplement substantive rules by providing notice of proposed rulemakinggiving at least 60 days for submission of public comments, unless the Departmentdetermines that such notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary,or contrary to the public interest (see 24 CFR 10.1). In addition, section7(o)(3) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act providesthat no rule may become effective until after the first period of 30 calendardays of continuous session of Congress following its publication. Undersection 7(o)(3), this rule could not take effect until mid-March 1989.The Department cannot comply with section 7(o)(3) and also meet the mandatein section 1005(a) of the McKinney Act to issue regulations that take effectnot later than 30 days after the effective date of the Act, <T3>i.e., </T3>take effect not later than December 7, 1988. The Departmentis publishing this rule for immediate effect because it interprets thespecific mandate in section 1005(a) as implicitly overriding the more generalrequirements of section 7(o)(3) and the Department's general rulemakingpolicies.These regulations, however, are being published as an interim rule in orderto permit public comment. The comment due date has been left open, because,as noted above, the Department must publish another rule for effect byFebruary 6, 1989 to implement the new construction component of project-basedassistance. That interim rule will announce the comment due date for bothinterim rules. The Department will then publish a final rule that takesinto consideration the public comment received on both interim rules.<T3>C. This Rule. </T3>This rule adds a new Subpart G to 24 CFR Part 882to implement the authority to attach project-based assistance to units.The requirements for project-based assistance have been placed in SubpartG of Part 882 because project-based assistance involves the use of fundsderived from the Section 8 Certificate Program, the pertinent rules forwhich are in Subparts A, B, and F of Part 882. In order to avoid unnecessarilyrepeating provisions common to both the ``finders-keepers'' CertificateProgram and for project-based assistance, wherever practicable, this SubpartG incorporates by cross-references pertinent provisions in Subparts A andB. Certain provisions in the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Programrules (Subparts D and E of Part 882) are also incorporated by cross-reference.In general, the modifications of Part 882, Subparts A and B requirementsfor project-based assistance fall within the following areas: policiesneeded to determine the 15-percent limit under which the PHA must be permittedto attach assistance to units; policies implementing the statutory rehabilitationrequirement; and inapplicability of those Section 8 Certificate Programpolicies that are unique to a ``finders-keepers'' program and, therefore,not pertinent to project-based assistance. There follows a section-by-sectiondescription of this interim rule.Section 882.701 Purpose and ApplicabilityUnder the ``finders-keepers'' policy, a holder of a Certificate of FamilyParticipation is responsible for finding suitable housing and the PHA maynot reduce the family's opportunity to choose among available units. Inaddition, a family assisted under the Section 8 Certificate Program whochooses to move is entitled (subject to certain conditions) to anotherCertificate. Because under these policies the Section 8 assistance essentiallymoves with the assisted family, the Certificate Program (as well as theSection 8 Housing Voucher Program) is characterized as providing ``tenant-based''assistance. In the Certificate Program, the PHA enters into a HAP Contractand makes assistance payments on behalf of the family after the familylocates a suitable unit and an owner willing to execute a HAP Contractwith the PHA and a lease with the tenant. By contrast, under project-basedassistance, the ``finders-keepers'' policy does not apply. Certificatesare not used. With project-based assistance, the PHA enters a HAP Contractwith the owner to make housing assistance payments for a specified termprovided the unit is occupied by an eligible family (the unit may be vacantfor a limited time). To fill vacant, project-based units, the PHA refersfamilies from its waiting list to the project owner. Because the assistanceis tied to the unit, a family that moves from the unit does not have anyright to continued assistance. To implement these policies andSection; 882.701(c)expressly makes andSection; 882.103, <T3>``Finders-Keepers'' policy; </T3>andSection; 882.208, <T3>Activities to encourage participation by Owners and others; </T3>andandSection; 882.209(m), <T3>Continued participation when Participant Family moves, </T3>inapplicableto project-based assistance provided under this Subpart G.Section 882.703 Additional DefinitionsSubpart G cross-references the definitions in Subpart A of Part 882. Italso cross-references the definition of ``Agreement to Enter into HousingAssistance Payments Contract'', as used in the Moderate RehabilitationProgram. The Agreement is necessary to ensure that the rehabilitation workis performed.Two new terms are defined: ``15-Percent Limit'' and ``Funding Source.''The former term is defined to mean: Fifteen percent of the total of thenumber of units for which funding is reserved by HUD for the PHA's Section8 Certificate Program. This definition uses the number of units reservedfor the PHA's Certificate Program in the calculation of the 15-PercentLimit.Under the ACC, HUD agrees to pay annual contributions for funding increments(or ``projects''), representing successive funding commitments by HUD forthe PHA's program. Under the form of ACC used in a PHA's Certificate Program,the ACC terminates on the same day for all funding increments appropriatedby Congress before Federal fiscal year 1988. However, for funding incrementsappropriated in Federal fiscal year 1988 and subsequent Federal fiscalyears, there is a separate ACC termination date for each funding increment.The establishment of a separate ACC term for each post-Federal fiscal year1987 funding increment implements section 8(b)(1) of the 1937 Act, as amendedby section 141 of the HCD Act of 1987. A PHA must identify the ACC expirationdate for the funding that is the source of the project-based assistance,and must ensure that the HAP Contracts do not extend beyond the applicableACC expiration date. Because pre-Federal fiscal year 1988 funding incrementsfor the PHA all have the same ACC expiration date, they are treated asone funding source. Accordingly, the definition of ``Funding Source'' specifiesthat funding authority provided before Federal fiscal year 1988 constitutesa single funding source.Section 882.705 Information To Be Submitted to HUD by the PHASection 882.705(a) sets out the basic requirements which must be met bya PHA for HUD to approve a PHA's application to attach assistance to units.The requirements are: the number of project-based units in the PHA CertificateProgram does not exceed the 15-Percent Limit; the unit sizes for unitsto which assistance will be attached are consistent with the unit sizedistribution for the Funding Source; and the rehabilitation period andHAP Contract term are within the ACC term for the Funding Source.Section 882.705(b) identifies the information that must be submitted forany PHA request to attach assistance to units. It is limited to the minimuminformation needed by HUD to ensure that the statutory requirements willbe met, in order to permit attachment of assistance to units when the 15-percentlimit is not exceeded.Section 882.707 HUD Review of PHA Plans To Attach Assistance to UnitsHUD reviews the information submitted by the PHA under andSection; 882.705(b)and approves the application to attach assistance if the requirements ofandSection; 882.705(a) are met. If the requirements have not been met HUDnotifies the PHA of the reasons for disapproval.Section 882.709 Annual Contributions Contract; Schedule of LeasingThis section incorporates by cross-reference andSection; 882.206, but alsomakes it clear that the schedule of leasing may take into account the timeneeded to complete the rehabilitation.Section 882.711 Housing Quality StandardsThis section incorporates by cross-reference the housing quality standardsin andSection; 882.109. Because rehabilitation is site-specific, this sectionalso incorporates by cross-reference andSection; 882.404(b), the site andneighborhood performance requirements for the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.Section 882.713 Eligible and Ineligible Properties; Rehabilitation RequirementThis section substitutes for andSection; 882.110, <T3>Types of housing. </T3>A major difference between this section andandSection; 882.110 is that this section implements the rehabilitation requirementin section 8(d)(2) of the 1937 Act. Section 882.713(a) provides that inorder for a property to be eligible housing, it must require a minimumexpenditure of $1000 per assisted unit, including work on common areas.The rehabilitation must involve:(1) Upgrading the property to decent, safe, and sanitary condition to complywith the Housing Quality Standards or other standards approved by HUD,from a condition below those standards;(2) Repairing or replacing major building systems or components in dangerof failure;(3) Making essential improvements to the property to permit use of theproperty by handicapped persons; or(4) Converting or merging units to provide housing for large Families.Paragraph (b) of andSection; 882.713 identifies specific ineligible housingtypes that are comparable to the ineligible housing types listed in andSection;882.401(c) (2)(ii) and (3) for the Moderate Rehabilitation Program. Assistance,however, may be attached to units in subsidized housing projects. Paragraphs(f) and (g) of this section, therefore, contain provisions similar to andSection;882.111 (e) and (f) to avoid payment of a double subsidy.Paragraphs (c) and (d), respectively, contain restrictions on when project-basedassistance may be attached to a highrise project for families with childrenand to single room occupancy housing. Again, these requirements are modeledafter comparable Moderate Rehabilitation provisions (see andSection; 882.401(c)(5) and (6)).Section 882.715 RelocationThe relocation requirements are generally modeled on the relocation requirementsfor the Moderate Rehabilitation Program (andSection; 882.406), but with asignificant difference. Under the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, theremay be permanent displacement (and andSection; 882.406 sets out terms underwhich permanent displacement may occur, including the assistance that mustbe provided to displacees.) Under this Subpart G, however, permanent displacementis prohibited. The Department believes that a project that cannot be rehabilitatedwithout permanently displacing tenants should not be assisted with project-basedassistance, and has prohibited such assistance in andSection; 882.715(a).(Because permanent displacement is prohibited, there is no cross-referencein andSection; 882.715 to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real PropertyAcquisition Policies Act of 1970.)Section 882.717 Other Federal RequirementsThis section lists the various applicable Federal statutes and other Federalauthorities, including civil rights and environmentally-related statutesand authorities.HUD is reponsible for ensuring compliance with Federal environmental lawsand authorities with respect to activities under this Subpart G. Section882.717(b)(1) encourages PHAs to select projects that will not require,or entail the delay of, compliance with the National Environmental PolicyAct or with the authorities listed in 24 CFR 50.4, by setting out the conditionsunder which a PHA may authorize the rehabilitation of a project in connectionwith project-based assistance without a prior HUD environmental review.A PHA should contact the environmental officer in the HUD Field Officeconcerning the type of information a State Historic Preservation Officermay need to respond to a PHA's request about a particular project underandSection; 882.717(b)(1)(ii). A PHA may authorize rehabilitation of a projectthat exceeds the thresholds in andSection; 882.717(b)(1), but the PHA mustfirst notify HUD so that HUD may carry out the necessary environmentalreview, as provided in andSection; 882.717(b)(2).Section 882.719 Initial Contract RentsThis section contains the requirements for establishing the Contract Rentsthat the PHA must list in the Agreement. The Contract Rents listed on executionof the Agreement, subject to reduction under andSection; 882.731(c), mustbe the Contract Rents upon execution of the HAP Contract (i.e., the initialContract Rents). Unlike the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, there is noauthority for increases in the initial Contract Rents during rehabilitation(contrast andSection; 882.408(d)).This section is based on andSection; 882.106, with modifications reflectingthe project-based character of the assistance provided under Subpart Gand other differences from the Certificate Program. Thus, HUD, under andSection;882.719(a), will not authorize an initial Contract Rent exceeding the FairMarket Rents based on grounds permitted in the Certificate Program underparagraphs (iv), (v), or (vi) of andSection; 882.106(a)(4). Those paragraphsauthorize the use of an exception rent based, in part, on a showing bythe PHA that leasing the unit is necessary to meet the unique needs ofa particular family. That basis for allowing an exception rent is not appropriatewhen the assistance is project-based and does not follow the family.Paragraph (b)(3) conforms to the purpose of a recent statutory amendmentto section 8(c)(2)(C) of the 1937 Act, by providing that, for units thatare not subject to local rent control while they are assisted, comparableunits used to determine rent reasonableness are other units that are exemptfrom rent control. A similar revision has been made to andSection; 882.106(b)(2).(See section 142(c)(1) of the HCD Act of 1987 and H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 426,100th Cong., 1st Sess. 177 (1987).) Wherever the concept of comparabilityis used in this section, it, of course, means comparable to the assistedunit as it will be <T3>after</T3> it is rehabilitated.There are no provisions similar to paragraph (f) of andSection; 882.106,which concerns shared housing. Under andSection; 882.713(b)(3), shared housingis not eligible for project-based assistance. This rule makes a conformingchange to andSection; 882.106(a)(2) to make it clear that the 20 percentlimitation on the number of units for which the PHA may approve initialGross Rents that exceed applicable FMRs is a limit on the combined totalnumber of units so approved under both the Certificate Program and thisproject-based assistance. This rule also makes a conforming revision toandSection; 888.111, Fair market rents for existing housing and moderaterehabilitation: applicability, to specify that existing housing Fair MarketRents apply to assistance provided under Subpart G.Section 882.719(a)(1) also contains provisions concerning utility allowancessimilar to the provisions in andSection; 882.209(f). These provisions areplaced in this section because they involve the determination of the initialContract Rents.Section 882.721 Contract Rent AdjustmentsThis section contains the requirements for adjusting the Contract Rentsduring the term of the HAP Contract after the Contract Rents have beenestablished by execution of the HAP Contract. This section is based onandSection; 882.108.Section 882.723 PHA Selection and Initial Inspection of UnitsThis section provides PHAs with broad discretion in establishing proceduresfor selecting units to which assistance is to be attached. Under paragraph(a), PHAs must establish written policies for selecting units. In addition,paragraph (a) also encourages PHAs to establish preferences for units tobe used as limited equity cooperatives. This provision reflects congressionalintent (see H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 122, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1987)).The Department has not encouraged PHAs to establish preferences for unitsreceiving tax credits, a preference also referred to in the ConferenceReport, because the Department is conducting an evaluation of the low-incometax credit, including the issue of the extent to which the tax credit requiresadditional assistance. This rule, however, does not limit the ability ofPHAs to utilize Section 8 project-based assistance in conjunction withthe tax credit.The Department also encourages PHAs to establish preferences for HUD-insuredsubsidized multifamily housing projects that are financially troubled andto work closely with their HUD Field Office in this regard. The use ofproject-based assistance for this purpose may prove very helpful in maintainingthe supply of subsidized housing.Section 882.725 Prohibition Against Rehabilitation With 1937 Act Assistance;Pledge of Agreement or HAP ContractSection 8(d)(2) of the 1937 Act provides that the owner may not use anyassistance provided under the 1937 Act to rehabilitate the structure towhich assistance will be attached. Section 882.725(a) implements this prohibitionby prohibiting attaching assistance to units that have been in the fiveyears before execution of the Agreement, or will be, rehabilitated withother assistance under the 1937 Act. It also identifies examples of 1937Act assistance that may not be used to rehabilitate the structure.Paragraph (a) also prohibits the use of flexible subsidy under 24 CFR 219to finance the rehabilitation of the units. Under the Flexible SubsidyProgram, HUD may provide financial assistance to owners of troubled projectsthat are assisted by HUD under the Section 236, Section 221(d)(3) BelowMarket Interest Rate, or Rent Supplement Programs. The assistance is tobe used to induce and assist owners to maintain the financial soundnessand the low- and moderate-income character of the projects by, among othermeans, physically upgrading the project. A PHA could attach project-basedassistance under this Subpart G to these types of projects in order toinduce the owner to rehabilitate the project. The Department believes,however, that each Program, by itself, is a sufficient inducement for ownersto rehabilitate projects and that permitting the Programs to be used inconjunction would result in fewer projects being rehabilitated.Paragraph (b) of andSection; 882.725 sets out the conditions under whichan owner may pledge its Agreement to Enter into a Housing Assistance PaymentsContract or its Housing Assistance Payments Contract as security for financing.The financing documents may not purport to pledge or give greater rightsto any party against the PHA than the contractual rights of the Owner underthe Agreement or HAP Contract. The financing documents may not includeany requirements inconsistent with the Agreement or HAP Contract. The PHAmay not be a party to any of the financing documents and may undertakeno obligations (other than those already specified under the Agreementor HAP Contract) in connection with the financing. No modification or alterationmay be proposed or made to the Agreement or HAP Contract.Section 882.727 Owner Selection of Contractor.This section contains similar policies to those stated in andSection; 882.504(g)for the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.Section 882.729 Work Write-Ups and Agreement to Enter into Housing AssistancePayment ContractThe work write-up provisions and the requirements for the Agreement arebased on similar provisions in the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, althoughtheir presentation has been reorganized. HUD is prescribing no specificform or format for the work write-ups. The PHA has the flexibility to determinethe appropriate content and documentation for the work write-ups.Increases in initial Contract Rents during rehabilitation are not permittedunder this section. They are permitted in the Moderate Rehabilitation Program(see andSection; 882.408(d)). Increases are not appropriate when project-basedassistance is involved because the initial Contract Rents are establishedon the basis of a rent reasonableness test, not on the cost of rehabilitation.Section 882.731 Rehabilitation Period, and Section 882.733 RehabilitationCompletionThese provisions are modeled on the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, andSection;andSection;882.506 and 882.507, respectively.Section 882.735 Housing Assistance Payments Contract (Contract)This section sets out HAP Contract requirements that are specific to assistanceprovided under this Subpart G. It provides more flexibility to PHAs toset the term of the Contract than is provided under the Moderate RehabilitationProgram (see andSection; 882.403(c)). (All Moderate Rehabilitation Contractshave 15 year terms.) With project-based assistance, PHAs may set the termbetween 2 and 15 years, but the Contract term may not exceed the ACC expirationdate for the Funding Source.The owner may also terminate the HAP Contract after two years. If the owner``opts out,'' the remaining funding authority would again be availablefor Certificates and the families that had been receiving project-basedassistance may be issued Certificates (see andSection; 882.745(e)).Section 882.737 Reduction of Number of Units Covered by Contract, Section882.739 Responsibilities of the PHA, andSection; 882.741 Responsibilitiesof the Owner, and Section 882.743 Obligations of the FamilyThese sections simply incorporate by cross-reference pertinent provisionsunder the Certificate Program and Moderate Rehabilitation Program, withoutmaking substantive changes.Section 882.745 Family ParticipationThis section implements the Certificate Program tenant selection policiesin andSection; 882.209, as modified to take into account the fact that theassistance is likely to be used in projects with occupied units and familiesare assisted in a specific project under a HAP Contract. Paragraph (b)is intended to ensure that an eligible tenant residing in a unit to beassisted is afforded the opportunity to lease that unit or another assistedunit of appropriate size, regardless of whether the family qualifies fora Federal preference. The Department does not believe that Congress intendedthat project-based assistance and the Federal preferences interact in away that could result in the displacement of eligible families from unitswith project-based assistance, only to fill the vacancies created withother eligible families. In addition, to avoid permanent displacement,the PHA and Owner may not select a unit if the unit is occupied by personsnot eligible for admission to the program.A family that is leasing a unit, with Certificate Program assistance, ina project that is to be rehabilitated with project-based assistance andwhich chooses to move has the right to continued participation in the CertificateProgram provided by andSection; 882.209(m). If such a family signs a leasefor a project-based unit, the family would no longer be a participant inthe Certificate Program.Section 882.747 Maintenance, operation, and inspections, Section 882.749Reexamination of Family income and composition, Section 882.751 Overcrowdedand underoccupied units, Section 882.753 Informal review or hearing, andSection 882.755 Grounds for denial or termination of assistanceThese sections, in general, either incorporate by cross-reference or restatecomparable policies in the Certificate Program or the Moderate RehabilitationProgram.Section 882.757 Termination of TenancyThis section incorporates by cross-reference Subpart A of 24 CFR Part 247,Evictions from Certain Subsidized and HUD-Owned Projects, which appliesto other project-based rental assistance programs administered by HUD.The section also adds provisions that limit the grounds for terminatingtenancy for good cause during the first year of the lease. Part 247 maybe obtained from HUD Field Offices.This rule also makes a conforming amendment to Part 247 by revising andSection;247.1 and by adding reference in andSection; 247.2(e) to this Subpart G.This rule also makes a technical revision to andSection; 247.2(e) to distinguishbetween those forms of subsidy that are project-wide and those that applyto particular units within a project.<T3>D. Recent Proposed Rulemaking on Section 16(b) Limitations. </T3>Section16 of the 1937 Act limits the number of families that are lower incomebut are not very low-income that may be initially assisted under severalof the 1937 Act programs, including the Section 8 Certificate Program andthis project-based component of that Program. Under section 16(b), admissionof non-very low-income families is limited to not more than 5 percent ofthe dwelling units that become available for occupancy under the affectedprograms. Section 103(a) of the HCD Act of 1987 amended section 16 to requireHUD to establish, as appropriate, differing percentage limitations on admissionof these families in the separate assistance programs. On April 29, 1988,at 53 FR 15412, the Department published a proposed rule to implement section103(a). HUD also published, on the same date, a notice (53 FR 15466) proposingthe respective percentage limitations for each of the affected programs.The notice proposed a one percent limitation for the Section 8 CertificateProgram. The notice did not separately address project-based assistance.(Section 1001(a) of the 1988 McKinney Act amended section 16, but maintainsthe requirement for percentages for each program.) HUD invites commenton whether the proposed one percent limitation for the Certificate Programshould be revised as a result of implementing this Subpart G. Readers,in considering this issue, should bear in mind that any change in the percentagelimitation for the Certificate Program may necessitate a change in thepercentage limitation for one or more of the other assistance programssubject to section 16, because the sum of the number of non-very low-incomefamilies, resulting from the use of these program-specific percentage limitations,may not exceed 5 percent nationally.<T3>E. Other Information. </T3>A Finding of No Significant Impact withrespect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulationsin 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impactis available for public inspection during regular business hours in theOffice of the General Counsel, Rules Docket Clerk, at the above address.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin Section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit would not: (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.In accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the undersigned herebycertifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities, because this rule does not alterthe amount of funding a PHA may receive. The rule, in accordance with thestatutory mandate, merely permits, but does not require, a PHA to attacha portion of the assistance it provides under the Section 8 CertificateProgram to units rather than have the assistance move with the families.HUD has determined, in accordance with E.O. 12612, <T3>Federalism</T3>, that this rule does not have a substantial, directeffect on the States or on the relationship between the Federal governmentand the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities amongthe various levels of government because this rule conforms HUD regulationsto a statutory requirement to permit PHAs to provide project-based assistance,for projects that are rehabilitated. To the extent that particular revisionshave altered responsibilities, these revisions are in response to statutorychanges and have increased the discretion of the non-Federal governmentalentities.HUD has determined that this rule is not likely to have a significant impacton family formation, maintenance, and general well-being within the meaningof E.O. 12606, <T3>The Family</T3>, because the rule concerns only a PHA's discretionto attach Certificate Program assistance to units. It does not affect theterms and conditions under which a family may qualify for assistance underthe Certificate Program. The Certificate Program, itself, is a benefitto families because it assists eligible families to afford decent safeand sanitary housing.The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520.

This Subpart G implements section 8(d)(2)(A) of the 1937 Act whichdirects the Department to permit a PHA to ``attach to structures'' up to15 percent of the Section 8 assistance provided by the PHA under the CertificateProgram. Within this 15 percent limit, the PHA may attach a Section 8 assistancecontract to a structure where the owner agrees to rehabilitate the structure<T3>other than</T3> with assistance provided under the United States HousingAct of 1937. The purpose of project-based assistance in the CertificateProgram is to induce property owners to upgrade substandard rental housingstock, and make it available to lower income families at rents within theSection 8 Existing Housing Fair Market Rents.(2) This Subpart G refers to assistance that is attached to units as ``project-based''assistance to distinguish this assistance from the ``tenant-based'' assistanceprovided by the Certificate Program under Subparts A, B, C, and F of thisPart and also by the Housing Voucher Program under 24 CFR Part 887. Withtenant-based assistance, the assisted unit is selected by the Family. ThePHA then enters into an assistance Contract, which only covers a singleunit and the specific assisted family. If the Family moves out of a unit,the assistance contract terminates. And, the family may may move with continuedassistance under the Program, and may find a new unit anywhere in the PHAjurisdiction.  (b) Except as otherwise expressly modified or excluded by this SubpartG, all provisions of Subparts A and B of this Part 882 apply to project-basedassistance under this Subpart G.

(See also andSection;882.729(c),<T3>Contract Rents in Agreement.</T3>) (2) The PHA may approve, on a unit-by-unit basis, initial Gross Rents thatexceed the applicable Fair Market Rents by up to 10 percent. The totalnumber of units with such rents approved under this paragraph (a)(2) andunder paragraph (a)(2) of andSection;882.106, Contract Rents, may not exceed20 percent of the number of units under ACC for the PHA's Certificate Program.The PHA, however, may also exercise such authority with respect to morethan 20 percent of the units under ACC if HUD approves such extension ofthe PHA's authority. In considering whether to grant such approval, HUDwill review the appropriateness of the applicable Fair Market Rents andthe relationship of estimated program costs to program objectives. (3) HUD may approve, upon request from a PHA, maximum initial Gross Rentsfor all units of a given size of up to 20 percent above the applicableFair Market Rents within a designated municipality, county, or similarlocality. Any such request must be supported by a statement of the specialcircumstances warranting such increase in the maximum Gross Rents, includingwhether such higher rents are necessary to implement a Housing AssistancePlan. In considering whether to grant such approval, HUD will review theappropriateness of the applicable Fair Market Rents and the relationshipof estimated program costs to program objectives. In no event shall a maximumGross Rent, as approved under this paragraph, exceed the rent, includingAllowances for Utilities and Other Services, determined by HUD to be theaverage rent currently being charged for available standard units of similarsize or type in the applicable municipality or county. (4) On the basis of a showing by the PHA that special circumstances applyto units of a given size limited to a specific neighborhood, and by reasonof these circumstances the reasonable Gross Rents for such units are ashigh as 20 percent above the applicable Fair Market Rents, and the unitscannot be rented for less, HUD may authorize the PHA to approve Gross Rentsfor such units up to 20 percent above the applicable Fair Market Rents.Authorization under this paragraph (a)(4) shall be based upon substantiallythe same criteria as under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except forthe last sentence of that paragraph. (b) <T3>Rent reasonableness limitation</T3>. Because the Fair Market Rentsare established for a geographic area, within which the rents for modestDecent, Safe, and Sanitary housing may vary substantially, the PHA shallmake an analysis to determine the reasonable rent for the particular unit.(1) The PHA shall certify for each unit it approves for project-based assistanceunder this Subpart G that the initial Contract Rent for the rehabilitatedunit is: (i) Reasonable in relation to rents currently being charged for comparableunits in the private unassisted market, taking into account the location,size, structure type, quality, amenities, facilities, and management andmaintenance service of the unit; and (ii) Not in excess of rents currently being charged by the Owner for comparableunassisted units. (2) If a PHA proposes to project-base assistance for fifty or more units,the PHA must obtain HUD Field Office approval of the Contract Rents beforeexecuting the Agreement. (3) For a rent-controlled unit, comparable units must be units that arerent-controlled; for a unit that is not subject to rent control, comparableunits must be units that are not rent-controlled. (c) <T3>Congregate housing. </T3>(1) The Fair Market Rent for each congregatehousing unit shall be the same as for a 0-bedroom unit, except that ifthe unit consists of two or more private rooms, the Fair Market Rent shallbe the same as for a 1-bedroom unit. (2) In determining the reasonableness of the rents, consideration shallbe given to the presence or absence of common rather than private cooking,dining, and sanitary facilities and the provision of special amenities,maintenance or management services, or a combination of both. (d) <T3>Independent Group Residences. </T3>(1) The Fair Market Rent for anIndependent Group Residence shall be the Fair Market Rent applicable tothe unit size being leased, for example, a 4-bedroom unit if the residencecontains 4 bedrooms. (2) A Resident Assistant who lives in the unit may be counted as a Familymember in determining the appropriate number of bedrooms. However, theResident Assistant's income shall be disregarded in determining the TotalTenant Payment, the Tenant Rent, or the Family's income eligibility.

(e) <T3>Single room occupancy units. </T3>(1) The Fair Market Rent for eachSRO unit shall be equal to 75 percent of the 0-bedroom Fair Market Rent.(2) In areas where HUD has approved the use of exception rents for 0-bedroomunits under paragraphs (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, the SRO exceptionrent will be 75 percent of the exception rent which applies to the ExistingHousing 0-bedroom unit. Further, a SRO unit may be granted an exceptionrent for its own specified unit size. In no case may the initial rent exceed75 percent of 120 percent (i.e. 90 percent) of the 0-bedroom unit FMR.(3) In determining the reasonableness of the rents, consideration willbe given to the presence or absence of sanitary or kitchen facilities.(f) <T3>Other services_exclusion from Contract Rent. </T3>The Contract Rentmay not include the cost of providing supportive services, housekeepingor laundry services, furniture, food, or the cost of serving food. <ITAG tagnum="20">(Information collection requirements contained in this section havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number2502-0388)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 882.721 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract Rent adjustments. </ITAG>(a) Contract Rents shall be adjusted as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and(a)(2) of this section, upon request of the Owner.
