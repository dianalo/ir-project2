The East Germans, chanting ``Deutschland!'' and shouting thanks,left Warsaw by train Thursday night on a trip via their communisthomeland and arrived in Laatzen, a Hanover suburb, nearly 14 hourslater.   West Germans welcomed the 633 refugees with cheers and pats onthe back. The refugees looked well-rested and more relaxed thanthose who arrived earlier in the week from Czechoslovakia.   West German officials and Red Cross workers readied temporaryhousing and other forms of care.   Those aboard had crowded West Germany's embassy in Warsaw inhopes of joining the East Germans who have made their way throughHungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland since mid-September. More than47,000 East Germans have left since then.   West German radio and television reported that as soon as thetrain left, about a dozen more East Germans entered Bonn's embassyin Warsaw in hopes of gaining permission to go West.   The journey comes as East Germany, deeply embarrassed by theexodus, begins two days of celebrations marking the communistcountry's 40th anniversary.   Among those flying in to attend the festivities is SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is expected to ask EastGermany's aging hard-line leaders how they plan to handle thewestward flight that is draining much of the East Germany's workforce.   West German radio said some people reportedly were ``gravelyinjured'' when East German police in Dresden prevented people fromboarding trains heading West late Wednesday and early Thursday.Also, 150 injuries and 80 arrests reportedly occurred during ademonstration Monday in Leipzig by 20,000 East Germans.   The figures were cited at a prayer service in an East Berlinchurch late Thursday, the radio said without elaborating.   Poland contributed two extra cars to a six-car East German trainsent to carry the refugees to West Germany, which grants themautomatic citizenship and helps them start new lives.   Julia Lange said the train stopped shortly after crossing fromPoland to East Germany and officials boarded.   ``We were informed that we were being expelled and theycollected our passports,'' said Ms. Lange, 30.   The freedom trains that left Czechoslovakia brought 7,600 EastGermans to the West Thursday.   In Prague, 200 East Germans left the West German Embassy lateThursday and headed home with promises from their government oflegal emigration within months. Sources said about 10 East Germansstill were inside the mission.   Czechoslovak police used riot police to seal off the embassyfrom more East Germans. East Germany restricted travel toCzechoslovakia earlier this week.   There was sympathy among Czechoslovaks for the East Germanrefugees. The hard-line Prague government has also refuseddemocratic reform.   ``Of course they are running away,'' a 40-year-old Czechoslovaksaid on condition of anonymity. ``They want freedom.   ``I am sure this will have some impact on our country ... but itwill take some time because our leadership is very conservative.''   East Germans began making their way west through Hungary in Maywhen that communist country removed obstacles from its border withAustria. Since Hungary officially opened its borders Sept. 10,about 32,000 East Germans have used that route to West Germany.   About 7,000 more East Germans arrived in West Germany lastweekend from Warsaw and Prague, where they had taken refuge in WestGerman embassies.   Police in Dresden reportedly used clubs and water cannons todrive thousands of people back from the main railroad stationduring the exodus from Czechoslovakia.   ``It was a horrible scene,'' said a woman in Dresden who askednot to be identified because she feared reprisals. ``People weretrying desperately to get to the platforms and the tracks, but thepolice forced them back.''   Masses of regular police, secret police and workers' groupsorganized by the Communist Party dispersed the crowds and sealedoff the stations.   East Germany insisted the trains pass through its territory,rather than crossing into West Germany from Czechoslovakia, so itcould formally declare the refugees expelled.</TEXT></DOC>
