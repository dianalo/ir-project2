SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fifth of all senior federal judges includingformer Chief Justice Warren E. Burger stand to collect their largestpay raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any courtcases, The Associated Press has learned.   This windfall _ increasing Burger's salary by $60,000 to $175,000a year _ stems from a retirement system allowing federal judges toreduce their caseloads sharply while still qualifying foractive-duty pay increases. In stepping down from full-time duty,they accept a title of ``senior judge.''   Aside from Burger, the 305 other senior judges also stand to seetheir salaries rise by about 50 percent unless Congress disapprovesthe raises due for top federal officials on Feb. 8.   Judges who retire through resignation _ the other option providedby Congress _ keep for life the same salary they received on theirlast day of work. In Burger's case, it would have been $108,400.   Senior status is the vastly more popular option. Burger, forexample, already has received one raise, in 1987, to $115,000.   Administrative records obtained by the AP indicate that roughlyone in five of the nation's senior judges do no judicial workwhatsoever. They get the raises but are as hard to find on the benchas the 13 former judges who chose full retirement.   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead, a member ofa House subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary. TheCalifornia Republican, whose skepticism last year sidetracked a billto lower the eligibility age for senior status, said Congress maywant to consider ``establishing some minimum work to qualify for theraises.''   As the law stands now, a senior judge may turn down any work hedoesn't want. A federal judge cannot be forced to resign; theConstitution says a judicial appointment is for life.   Stephen Gillers, a New York University legal ethics professor,said he sees no ethical problem for the non-working senior judgesbut ``it may be the statute should be changed. It may be unwise orbad management. It's a question whether the public is getting itsmoney's worth.''   Congress created the senior judge category in 1919 to ease courtworkloads and open jobs for younger appointees, by luring olderjudges out of their lifetime appointments.   In large measure, senior judges pitch in just as Congressintended.   As a group, they handle between 10 and 15 percent of all federalcases. ``The federal judiciary would be a mess without the help ofsenior judges,'' said Frank Coffin, an appeals court judge fromPortland, Maine.   Some, like 91-year-old Elbert P. Tuttle of Atlanta, are on thebench almost as often as their 750 active colleagues. Tuttle doesabout 70 percent as much work as any of the active judges in hiscircuit, according to circuit executive Norman Zoller.   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the only public report onsenior judge workloads, compiled by the Administrative Office of theCourts. Identifying each senior judge only by a code number, with nonames listed, the report showed that in the year ending June 30,1987, 56 of 271 senior judges, or 21 percent, handled no cases.Forty nine of the 56 were over 75 years old.   David Cook, who compiles the statistics, said office policy barshim from releasing information on individual judges by name, or morerecent coded data. But he said, ``If you did the survey today, Idon't think things would be much different.''   Cook said the 1987 patterns are ``not out of date.''   For those senior judges who do not work, reasons can differdramatically.   James Noel Jr., a senior judge in Houston, performed his lastjudicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was $54,500 _ $80,500 ayear less than he stands to begin receiving next month.   Noel, 79, took senior status in 1976 when he was 66, after 15years as a federal trial judge. Asked why he chose senior status andnot resignation, Noel said: ``It was just a matter of choice.''   Senior status is available to any judge who is at least age 65with 15 years experience or 70 with 10 years.   Noel regularly uses his downtown office to manage his ``extensiveinvestments.'' When asked about his impending pay raise, Noel said,``I was expecting it.''   Owen Cox, a federal trial judge in Texas since 1970, took seniorstatus in 1981. Jesse Clark, the district court's clerk, said Coxdid substantial work until his health failed.   ``He's been hospitalized for three years. He's on a life-supportsystem,'' Clark said.   Cox's salary would rise to $135,000 next month. Had he resignedhis salary would have been frozen at $67,100.   Burger left the Supreme Court in September 1986 to serve asfull-time but unpaid chairman of the commission celebrating thebicentennial of the Constitution. Burger, who has spent much of hiscareer campaigning for higher judicial salaries, declined to answerquestions about his own impending pay increase and his judicialworkload other than to say, ``I'm too busy to sit.''   Gillers said nothing in law or judicial standards makes itunethical for a senior judge to do no work and collect pay raises.   ``I can't speak to the personal propriety,'' he said. ``Everyjudge has to make that decision for himself.''</TEXT></DOC>
