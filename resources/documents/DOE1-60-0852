<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-60-0852 </DOCNO><TEXT>A clinical diagnosis of aneurysm may be made on the basis of the physicalexamination, particularly for the abdominal aorta and the femoral andpopliteal arteries. However, sometimes these physical findings can beunreliable, since aortic aneurysms can be missed in obese patients andsince overlying retroperitoneal and other visceral masses may simulateaneurysms in the abdomen, especially in thin patients with easily transmittedaortic pulsations. Moreover, a tortuous aorta or iliac arteries may mimican aneurysm. Thus to avoid surgery, it is critical to obtain independentand objective confirmation of the diagnosis. In addition, more detailedinformation concerning the size and configuration of abdominal aneurysmsincreases the data base from which a decision for surgery may be made,particularly in poor-risk patients with small, asymptomatic aneurysms.Conventional contrast, digital subtraction, and isotope angiograms havebeen advocated for the diagnosis and characterization of abdominal aorticaneurysms. However, all angiographic studies define only the inner lumenof the aneurysm and may provide grossly inaccurate data regarding theoverall aneurysmal size. Further, conventional contrast angiography isinvasive and expensive and has a small but definite complication rate.Therefore, angiography should bot be performed as a primary diagnosticprocedure for most aneurysms, but rather as a preoperative investigation,when indicated, after surgery has definitely been decided upon. The purposeof the angiogram is to further delineate the anatomy of paraaneurysmalstructures, with particular emphasis on renal artery and visceral vessellesions, the presence of iliac aneurysms, and the distribution of iliofemoralocclusive disease.</TEXT></DOC>
