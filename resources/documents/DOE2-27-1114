The case of the extraordinarymode at a frequency lower than the electron gyrofrequency is studiedin detail for a wave packet of finite width, carrying a power in themegawatt range, which is absorbed away from the plasma center. It isshown that in this case, because of the interplay of quasilinear andtrapping effects (i) the current drive efficiency is strongly power dependentand (ii) wave absorption at the inboard part of the magnetic surfacesdoes not maximize the efficiency, in contrast to the results of lineartheory.</TEXT></DOC>
