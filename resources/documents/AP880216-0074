The route is to be ready in time for ceremonies April 19 markingthe 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the officialPolish news agency PAP reported Tuesday. Several thousand peoplefrom Israel, the United States and other countries are expected toattend.   The route is to be marked with 16 shiny black stones, beginningat the monument to the heroes of the uprising in which poorly armedJewish fighters died resisting the final Nazi drive to liquidatethe ghetto's 60,000 remaining Jews.   One stone marker will be placed near the mound at 18 Mila Streetbuilt on the ruins of the bunker headquarters of MordechaiAnielewicz, the leader of the uprising.   It will end at the so-called ``Umschlagplatz'' or ``LoadingSquare'' on Stawki Street, near the former railroad ramps. BetweenJuly 1942 and April 1943, the Nazis loaded nearly 300,000 Jews ontoboarded-up cattle cars bound for the gas chambers of Treblinka,about 60 miles northeast of Warsaw.   The Umschlagplatz currently is marked by a modest bronze plaquenear a busy gas station, but a newly constructed monument will beunveiled in April.   PAP said Warsaw municipal authorities had allocated about$132,000 for the project. International Jewish organizations raisedabout $30,000, with some of the money covering the cost ofimporting special stone-cutting machines.</TEXT></DOC>
