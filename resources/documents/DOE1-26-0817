The treatment of queueing theory applied to theseoperations presents conceptual and quantitative models applicable toboth planning and management. The approach integrates operations research,management science, and systems engineering, enabling practitioners inthe field to formulate and describe in general terms the characteristicquantities of construction and mining operations.</TEXT></DOC>
