Axel, 74, and Eigil, 67, were among the first 11 male couples toexchange vows Sunday as Denmark became the first country to givehomosexual couples legal status and the right to join in a``registered partnership.''   Hundreds of homosexuals applauded, waved flags and threw rice onthem on the Town Hall steps, while Christian fundamentalistsdemonstrated on the other side of the square. One demonstratorwaving a Bible called it ``Sodom's Day.''   ``Homosexuality is a sin,'' he said.   Parliament in May approved a gay rights bill by a lopsidedmajority. Only the small People's Christian party opposed themeasure.   The law, which took effect Sunday, gives homosexual couplesnearly equal rights as heterosexual couples but bars them fromadopting children. They have the same inheritance rights, taxadvantages and the right to share a last name.   Under the new law, at least one partner must have Danishcitizenship and live in Denmark.   Like the other 10 couples, Axel and Eigil solemnly answered``yes'' to deputy mayor Tom Ahlberg when he asked if they consentedto tie each other in ``a registered partnership.'' They combinedtheir first names to form a common last name.   ``We decided to get officially `married' because we have thesame feelings for each other as heterosexual couples,'' said Axel,speaking on Danish television. He and Eigil later left town forseveral days, friends said, apparently on a honeymoon.   No lesbian couples have been registered. ``We don't like to bein the front line,'' one woman said after Sunday's ceremony.   ``The next step will be the acquisition of the right to adoptstepchildren from one of the partners from an earlier heterosexualmarriage and the right to be blessed in a church,'' said IvanLarsen, who was among the couples and is a pastor of the DanishEvangelist Lutheran Church.   ``If I had the right to marry a homosexual couple in my church,I would certainly like to do so, but for the time being we'll haveto wait,'' Larsen said.   ``When it (the partnership) becomes official, it lasts longer,''said Larsen's partner, school psychologist Ove Carlsen, who movedinto the church parsonage two years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
