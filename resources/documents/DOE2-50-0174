Nevada, to values clustering at -11and -18 (T/sub DM/=1.3 and 1.9Ga) in the Deep Creek and Schell CreekRanges in the east-central Great Basin. The isotopic variations in theMCG correspond spatially to changes in the {element_of}/sub ND/(0) andT/sub DM/ Precambrian basement adjacent to the miogeocline, suggestingthat the MCG were derived from these crustal terranes and were depositedclose to the paleocontinental margin of the western US. An {element_of}/subNd/(0)=22.14 (T/sub DM/=2.1 Ga) for deeper water miogeoclinal sedimentin the southern Great Basin (Wyman Fm-White Mountains, California) requiresa source either in nearby T/sub DM/=2.2Ga crust in the S. Sierra Nevada(Bennett and DePaolo, 1984), or in T/sub DM/andgt;2.0Ga crustal terranes tothe north, with the sediment having been transported southward via Precambrianlongshore currents. Feldspathic sandstone of the Cambrian Harmony Formationin north-central Nevada has {element_of}/sub Nd/(0)=-25.22 (T/sub DM/=2.4Ga),consistent with a northerly source in Archean crust of present-day Idaho,while Ordovician shale of the Vinini Fm. in central Nevada has {element_of}/subNd/(0)=-17.6, identical to values for the MCG exposed directly to theeast.</TEXT></DOC>
