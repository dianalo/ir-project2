Under the accord, goods will be valued in dollars atstandard world prices but real payment will be limited to thedifference in value between the goods exchanged. Payment willbe in national currencies that could then be used for furtherpurchases. To manage the barter trade, a Russian CommercialHouse joint-stock company will be established.   The accord could help stem Czechoslovakia's export crisis.Since 1989, with the disintegration of the East bloc'seconomic cooperation group and the introduction ofhard-currency payments, Czechoslovak income from exports tothe U.S.S.R. dropped to $1.8 billion a year from $5.5billion. Russia represents 85% of the Soviet market forCzechoslovak exports.   Separately, Czechoslovakia's parliament ended a40-year-old state broadcasting monopoly, passing a lawenabling the establishment of independent television andradio stations and news agencies.                                                                                                          JAPAN PLANS MOON PROBE                                                                                                          Tokyo endorsed plans to send a satellite into orbit aroundthe moon and drop probes into the surface to study thegenesis of &quot;moon quakes,&quot; or seismic activity, and interiorheat flows. The $100 million LunarA mission, expected to bestaged in early 1996, would make Japan the third nation afterthe Soviet Union and the U.S. to land a lunar probe. LastMarch, Japan become the third nation to send a craft intolunar orbit.                                                                                                          PHILIPPINE INVESTING EXPANDED                                                                                                          Foreign investors now can own 100% of business concerns inthe Philippines that export at least 60% of productioncapacity. Lawmakers gave final approval to the ForeignInvestments Act, which supplants a constitutional provisionlimiting foreign equity participation to 40%. The law allowsforeign investors to own fully any enterprises that don'tappear on the Foreign Investment Negative List. Investmentareas on this list are those considered linked to nationaldefense and security, public health and morals, and strategicnational economic development, though exemptions arepossible.                                                                                                          EUROPEAN OPERA FUNDS FADE                                                                                                          The new Opera Bastille in Paris has postponed for twoyears an international singing competition that had beenscheduled for May, citing government budget cuts. In Britain,the English National Opera could lose part of its statesubsidy, unless it raises more cash, such as from patrons, inthe next 12 months. And the Royal Opera House seeks largeraudiences to trim a $4.6 million deficit.                                                                                                          CHINA TO STOP DISSIDENTS' TRIALS?                                                                                                          China won't try any more activists involved in thestudent-led pro-democracy movement of 1989, judiciaryofficials told U.S. lawyers in Beijing. But in a sign thiswon't mean leniency for those dissidents, a Beijing courtrejected appeals of two alleged masterminds of the protests,their friends and relatives said; court officials couldn'tconfirm this. Long prison sentences were handed down todissidents tied to the Tiananmen Square protests. Hundreds oftrials have been held since the army crushed thedemonstrations, killing hundreds of people.                                                                                                          NAMIBIA MARKS YEAR ON ITS OWN                                                                                                          Namibia observes its first year of independence today,amid fears its chances of becoming an Africa success storyare threatened by a sagging economy and rising discontent.The government has sought to build democracy and bringpolitical and ethnic groups into the ruling process.

Kansai Electric PowerCo. agreed to shut down the plant this morning. The metalfittings, meant to reduce the vibration of steam generatorpipes, either were missing or improperly installed in the No.2 Takahama Nuclear Power Plant in Fukui prefecture, westernJapan, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.MITI had ordered five electric power companies to inspecttheir 17 nuclear plants that have the same type of reactorinvolved in the Feb. 9 accident at the Mihama Nuclear PowerPlant, which also is operated by Kansai Electric. Thecompany, which notified the Fukui government Tuesday of theproblem, wouldn't say when it detected the Takahama plant'sdefects.
