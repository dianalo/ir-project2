Risk assessmentmay be used to determine the likelihood that an environmental agent maycause human disease (that is, potential to cause human cancer or toxicity).On the assumption that the agent causes a particular disease, given currentand projected exposure levels, a quantitative evaluation can be madeon the magnitude of the likely impact of the agent on public health.In the report, the feasibility of performing a micro-biological riskassessment for pathogens in municipal waste-water sludge by various disposaloptions was evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
