In more than 650 labor contracts negotiated between 1984and 1989, new hires wound up on lower pay scales than theirsenior co-workers in a variety of industries, includingretail food chains, airlines, metal fabrication and lumber.</LP><TEXT>   Now, a growing population of restive lower-tier workersare putting the heat on companies and unions alike toeliminate separate wage scales. &quot;We like to describe it asmortgaging the unborn,&quot; grumbles Chris Manno, a second-tierpilot at American Airlines of Dallas, where a two-tier systemaccepted by its unions in 1983 resulted in new hires gettingup to 50% less than employees already on the payroll.   With many industries facing a shrinking labor pool,second-tier voices are being heard. Already, the gap betweentiers has shrunk in some existing dual-pay plans, such asAmerican's; in a few cases, the whole structure has beenscuttled.   Meanwhile, despite some notable exceptions -- LockheedCorp. machinists and Northwest Airlines pilots recentlyagreed to two-tier contracts -- both labor and management areshying away from new ones. With hundreds still in effect,such pacts aren't in immediate danger of extinction. But,according to the Bureau of National Affairs, a privateresearch firm, only 6% of the 962 non-construction contractsnegotiated in 1989 contained two-tier plans, down from a peakof 11% in 1985.   &quot;They're always going to be around, but I think they'regoing to be fairly rare in 10 years,&quot; says Wayne StateUniversity economist James E. Martin, author of a recentstudy on the subject.   Two-tier contracts spread during the recession-riddenearly 1980s, as companies scrambling to keep up withderegulation and growing nonunion and foreign competitionpressed their workers for concessions. Union members accededin many cases, opting to secure their own jobs and wagelevels instead of accepting across-the-board cuts.   In many early contracts, second-tier workers could neverearn as much as their senior co-workers because the twoscales never merged. Many new hires also got less insurancecoverage, vacation time and pension benefits.   American Airlines spokesman John Hotard says the two-tiersystem was &quot;the growth plan that kept us alive&quot; during theearly 1980s, when American found itself besieged bylower-priced competition such as People Express. Americanthought it could cut labor costs significantly as attritionand growth increased the percentage of B-scalers on thepayroll. Under the two-tiered system, American has grownsharply, from 39,000 workers in 1983 to almost 80,000 today.   But the hiring of lower-tier workers has proved to be adouble-edged sword. As the economy recovered in recent years,many companies poured their savings from lower wages intoexpansion, hiring more lower-paid workers. That, in turn,meant a flood of new members and added clout for many unions.But the new members were often second-tier workers who, astheir numbers grew, became more vocal in opposing thetwo-tier system.   Consider the United Food and Commercial Workers Union,whose locals probably agreed to more two-tier contracts thanany other union. These days, the union is pushing employersto merge the scales. The main reason, says Bill Olwell, UFCWexecutive vice president for collective bargaining, ispressure from second-tier members: &quot;They're becoming closerto a majority and we're a political organization, so we'reresponding to them.&quot;   Last year, UFCW members' demands for equal pay triggeredan 81-day strike against unionized food chains in Seattle.The result was a 27% raise for lower-tier employees, comparedwith about 9% for more senior workers. Eight of the 19two-tier agreements renegotiated by the UFCW in 1989 resultedin higher pay increases for second-tier workers than thefirst-tier.   Among the 17,000 American Airlines employees representedby the Association of Professional Flight Attendants,&quot;B-tier&quot; attendants have begun wearing &quot;Killer B&quot; pins undertheir lapels. During a recent union election, one slate ofcandidates was defeated, in part because pamphlets werecirculated outlining their involvement in negotiatingAmerican's initial two-tier contract.   Not all unions have been split by the two-tierarrangements. In 1988, senior flight attendants at AlaskaAirlines agreed to a two-year pay freeze so that theirlower-tier employees could get a 10% raise. Elsewhere, senioremployees have agreed to accept lump-sum payments in lieu ofthe raises given to lower-tier employees.   Johnny Rodriguez, president of a UFCW local representing580 Dallas meatcutters, says senior employees have discoveredthat lower wages for new hires make it more difficult for allemployees to get raises. &quot;They realized that without a strongfoundation, the house can collapse,&quot; he says.   But even with the two-tier system under fire, a fewcompanies still resort to it. Lockheed did so this yearbecause it needed to attract more highly skilled workerswhile cutting wages for lower level jobs to meet spendingguidelines on government contracts. &quot;I really don't care fora two-tier wage system because it creates too many personnelproblems,&quot; says Louis J. Barnard, Lockheed's vice presidentfor human resources. &quot;But the alternative is to cut people'spay, and nobody likes that.&quot;   In many cases, companies have begun merging their paytiers and granting lower-tier workers larger pay increasesjust to attract workers amid a shrinking labor pool. &quot;Unionwages have been held down so much that there is sometimes noadvantage to having a B-tier because you can't hire newworkers cheaper anyway,&quot; says Peter Cappelli, a managementprofessor at the Wharton School at the University ofPennsylvania.   Giant Food Inc., a Washington area grocery chain,gradually decreased the pay differential between the twotiers from $3 an hour in the early 1980s to about $1.50 now.&quot;The work force in the Washington metro area has just beenshrinking in the last half-dozen years,&quot; says Eric Weiss,Giant's director of labor relations. &quot;By increasing the rate,we increased the labor pool we have to select from.&quot;   Some experts contend that labor shortages and uniondiscontent are less responsible for the decline of two-tiercontracts than the overall improvement of the economy sincethe early 1980s. &quot;You don't have as many companies that areunder the gun in terms of reducing their labor costs,&quot; saysMark A. de Bernardo, director of labor law for the U.S.Chamber of Commerce. If the country slips into anotherrecession, he says: &quot;you're going to see them more prevalentagain.&quot;   Union leaders say they'll fight any such resurrection, butmany admit that they're not sure how their current memberswould handle the decision that thousands of workers faced adecade ago. &quot;It was a shrewd move by management,&quot; lamentsGordon Brehm, an executive with the United PaperworkersInternational Union. &quot;It's human nature for people to say,`Well, it's not going to hurt me and the people who cometomorrow can look after themselves.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
