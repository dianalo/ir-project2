Moore (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> BON BNK FIN </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The outcome of the Bank of England's final experimental auction of British government securities today could decide the fate of the U.S.-style bond sales, analysts believe.    Today's sale of #1 billion ($1.82 billion) of 10-year U.K. government bonds is the third auction in a series begun last May. The tests began on a high note as 26 newly appointed primary dealers placed big bids for bonds to impress the central bank supervisors.    But since then, unprecedented market volatility and fierce competition have inflicted heavy losses on many dealers. A number of dealers slashed staff and capital committed to U.K. government bonds, known as gilts. Three firms withdrew completely.    The market tumult damped interest in the second auction last September and likely will sour the reception for today's auction, some analysts suggest. &quot;The (auction) system hasn't been a raging success so far,&quot; says Colin Taylor, a London-based gilt official for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    A few gilt specialists suspect the central bank may dispense with auctions and return to its traditional controlled way of selling gilts through so-called taps. &quot;Auctions in the U.S. sense would mean giving up control. The Bank of England never was happy with that possibility,&quot; says the senior gilt executive at one big U.S. bank's unit here.    Others expect the Bank of England to continue holding a few auctions a year, mostly to cater to foreign investors. These analysts believe the balance of Britain's waning government borrowing requirement would be funded through tap issues.    Under the tap method, the central bank sets a fixed price on its securities and accepts tender offers from market-makers over a period of weeks. With auctions, it stipulates the amount of securities for sale at one time and lets bids determine their price.    As usual, the Bank of England is mum about its intentions. A spokesman said it will assess the role of auctions after consulting with market participants following today's sale.    Another likely development this year could persuade the central bank to give auctions more serious consideration, says Michael Birks, a gilts director here for Bankers Trust Co. The expected entry soon of several big Japanese securities firms as primary dealers could reshuffle the market drastically, the U.S. banker says. &quot;It was a big mistake to try it (an auction system) before the Japanese came in. The retail demand they represent could prove how fair and efficient the auction system really is.&quot;    Whether U.S.-style auctions of gilts continue &quot;is a very close call,&quot; says John Shepperd, a gilts economist at Warburg Securities. Mr. Shepperd says the globalization of markets is the strongest factor favoring continued gilt auctions. &quot;We have to have a market system understandable and accessible to outsiders,&quot; he observes. &quot;And auctions make the unfamiliar gilt market more attractive and natural for overseas investors.&quot;    Foreign interest will get a major test today. The 10-year bonds up for auction are considered the most attractive maturity for foreign investors because 10 years is the most common maturity for government securities in markets outside the U.S. and Japan. </TEXT></DOC>
