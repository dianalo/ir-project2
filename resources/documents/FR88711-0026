Comments on Proposed RuleOn May 28, 1987, the Department published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 19990) the DOSAR, a proposed rule thatwould implement and supplement the FAR. One public entity commented onthe DOSAR; the Department responded directly to that entity.The DOSAR was rewritten in consideration of comments received from theOffice of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) of the Office of Managementand Budget, comments received from Department of State offices, or to providea more accurate and readable document. Except as provided in SupplementaryInformation sections C and D below, those changes have been incorporatedinto the final rule.B. Final RuleThis final rule includes updates to the DOSAR resulting from changes madeto the FAR since the DOSAR was published as a proposed rule; therefore,the original DOSAR coverage could not be published as written in the proposedrule. The changes are as follows.1. DOSAR 601.602-3, Ratification of Unauthorized Contractual Commitments,rewritten pursuant to Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 84-33.2. DOSAR 630.201-5, Waiver, added pursuant to FAC 84-30.3. DOSAR 630.303, CAS Program Requirements, retitled to conform with FAC84-30.4. DOSAR 630.304, Waiver, deleted pursuant to FAC 84-30.5. DOSAR 632.111-70(a), prescription for prompt payment, rewritten as partof DOSAR 632.111-70, and the clause at DOSAR 652.232-70, Prompt Payment,deleted pursuant to FAC 84-33.C. Interim Final RuleAs a result of OFPP's review, the Department has agreed to issue the followingDOSAR coverage as an interim final rule. The Department has determinedthat compelling reasons exist to promulgate an interim final rule becausethe coverage is required and it was previously published in the DOSAR proposedrule.1. OFPP recommended that the Department submit for inclusion in the FARseveral items covered in the proposed rule that may not be unique to theDepartment of State. Those items were identified in the preamble to theproposed rule and included:(a) DOSAR 604.404-70, prescription for contracts involving classified informationand security clearances for contractor personnel, and the clauses at DOSAR652.204-70, Security Requirements, and DOSAR 652.204-71, Security Requirements_Personnel;(b) DOSAR 614.201-7-70(a), prescription for use of English language solicitationsand contracts awarded or performed overseas, and the clause at DOSAR 652.214-70,Language Version; and (c) DOSAR 619.201(d), responsibilities of the Small and Disadvantaged BusinessUtilization Specialist.  The Department received no public comments or comments from other Federalagencies on these items. Nevertheless, the Department has submitted theseitems to the FAR Council for consideration of FAR coverage.  2. In reviewing the DOSAR for publication as a final rule, OFPP recommendedthe following additional items as appropriate for coverage in the FAR: (a) DOSAR 614.201-7-70(c), prescription for contractor's authorizationto perform, and the clause at DOSAR 652.214-72, Authorization to Perform; (b) DOSAR 628.7001, prescription for the Government's indemnity by thecontractor, and the clause at DOSAR 652.228-70, Indemnification; and  (c) DOSAR 633.104 and 633.105, which implement FAR 33.104 and 33.105 concerningprotests to the General Accounting Office and the General Services AdministrationBoard of Contract Appeals;  (d) DOSAR 642.270 and 642.271, prescription for the contracting officer'srepresentative, and the clause at DOSAR 652.242-70, Contracting Officer'sRepresentative (COR).  The Department has submitted the above items to the FAR Council for considerationof FAR coverage.  As the material identified in paragraphs 1 and 2 above is added to theFAR, the DOSAR will be amended accordingly. Public comments received inresponse to this interim rule shall be considered in formulating a finalrule.  D. Standardization  In consideration of OFPP's substantive problems with the coverage at DOSARSubpart 617.70, Standardization, the Department agreed not to issue thatcoverage as either a final rule or an interim final rule. Therefore, DOSARSubpart 617.70 has been removed from this rule.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements  </ITAG>A. Review Under Executive Order 12291  This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) inaccordance with Executive Order 12291.  B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act  Consistent with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub.L. 96-354, and as required under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the undersigned herebycertifies that these interim and final rules will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the ruleserves only to implement or supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation. C. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act  These interim and final rules do not contain information collection requirementsthat require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,Pub. L. 96-511 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The rules do not impose additionalrecordkeeping or reporting requirements beyond those contained in the FAR,for which OMB control numbers have already been assigned.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Ch. 6  </ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the reasons set out in the preamble, Chapter 6 of Title 48 ofthe Code of Federal Regulations is established as follows.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John J.

Under Delegation of Authority No. 120-3 (51 FR 16768,May 6, 1986), the Assistant Secretary for Administration redelegated tothe Procurement Executive the authority to prescribe, promulgate, and amendDOS acquisition policies, rules, and regulations. (b) The Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) is prescribedunder the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2658 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c) (Title II, Chapter288, section 205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative ServicesAct of 1949, as amended). (c) The DOSAR implements and supplements the FAR.

The DOSAR is divided into the same parts, subparts, section, subsectionsand paragraphs as is the FAR. However, when the FAR coverage is adequateby itself there will be no corresponding DOSAR coverage. Where the DOSARimplements a specific part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR,the DOSAR coverage is numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriateFAR number and title, except that the DOSAR number will include a 6 or60 such that there will always be three numbers to the left of the decimal.For example, the DOSAR implementation of FAR 14.1 is shown as 614.1 andthe DOSAR implementation of FAR 1.301 is shown as 601.301. Materials thatsupplement the FAR are assigned the numbers 70 and up. For example, DOSARrequires additional definitions than those used in FAR; this supplementarymaterial is provided in 602.101-70. (b) The DOSAR and its revisions are published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and in the Code of Federal Regulations, bothof which may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, GovernmentPrinting Office, Washington, DC 20402. (c)(1) The DOSAR shall be referenced in the same manner as described atFAR 1.104-2(c). Using the DOSAR coverage at 609.407-3(a) as a typical illustration,reference to the_ (i) Part would be ``DOSAR Part 609'' outside the DOSAR and ``Part 609''within the DOSAR. (ii) Subpart would be ``DOSAR Subpart 609.4'' outside the DOSAR and ``Subpart609.4'' within the DOSAR. (iii) Section would be ``DOSAR 609.407'' outside the DOSAR and ``609.407''within the DOSAR. (iv) Subsection would be ``DOSAR 609.407-3'' outside the DOSAR and ``609.407-3''within the DOSAR.
