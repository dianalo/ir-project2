Both GM and Ford Motor Co. put formal contract offers onthe bargaining table yesterday in their bid to become theunion's &quot;target&quot; company for negotiating a pattern-settingcontract among the Big Three auto makers. Details of the Fordproposal couldn't be learned. Chrysler Corp. will make itscontract proposal to the union today.</LP><TEXT>   The UAW is bargaining separately with the three automakers for a contract for a total 450,000 UAW members.   In its proposal to the auto makers, the union has askedthem to keep all their current employees on the job, and paythem full wages and benefits unless there is a severe threatto the viability of the company. That proposal is similar tothe practices followed by Japanese auto makers.   The union is scheduled to select its target company onTuesday, and it is widely expected to be GM. The currentthree-year contract between the companies and the unionexpires Sept. 14.   Although few details were provided about GM's offer toboost benefits to laid-off workers, it is known that thecompany is willing to increase the amount of money furloughedworkers get, rather than boosting non-dollar benefits. Onecurrent GM program pays laid-off workers up to 95% of theirtake-home pay, although that fund is low and benefits havebeen reduced.   GM's proposal included a base-wage increase in the firstyear, followed by lump sum-payments at the outset of the twofollowing years. GM also proposed to improve its pension planfor UAW retirees.   Taken together, the moves could help GM reduce its workforce by taking some of the pain out of permanent layoffs itsays are necessary to make it more competitive and byencouraging some of its older workers to retire once theybecome eligible for pensions.   In return, GM wants UAW officials to approve measures thatwould increase productivity in its factories and allow thecompany to discharge habitually absent employees.   The proposal, which GM officials gave to UAW officials ina closed-door meeting here, marks the first such initialproposal in which the company offered pay raises to its UAWemployees. Typically, the company doesn't &quot;put money on thetable&quot; until final negotiations began.   Neither the company nor the union would formally commenton the details of the proposal. Persons close to thenegotiations, however, did describe the proposal on thecondition of anonymity.   The pay-increase gambit could sway UAW leaders to selectGM as the target company for negotiations.   When the UAW chooses one of the Big Three as its target,it will break off negotiations with the other two auto makersand press talks with the target company for an accord beforethe contract expires.   &quot;We're serious about going first,&quot; a GM executive said,indicating his company's preference to be the target.   GM wants to use the talks to get top union leaders tosupport their desire for greater flexibility in the plants.One of GM's chief objectives is to gain support in the UAWfor operating its plants on three shifts. That would allowthe auto maker to boost vehicle output of some models --assuming demand warranted such a movethereby greatlyincreasing a plant's profits.   The auto maker also wants to stem absenteeism, a seriousproblem in GM's factories; it often hovers around 15% of itshourly work force daily.   Although GM's wage-increase proposal comes much earlierthan usual, it is structured similar to the current contract.The pact awarded UAW members a 3% base-wage increase in thefirst year, followed by lump-sum payments equal to 3% oftheir wages in each of the following two years. GM's currentwage proposal is less than 3%, but it is unlikely that thefinal settlement will be identical with the current offer.   UAW President Owen Bieber attended formal negotiatingsessions with all three auto makers this week. He urged themto pick up the pace of bargaining and told them that theiroffers will play a significant role in determining whichcompany the union will select as target.</TEXT></DOC>
