The storm, which officials said killed at least 76 people onland and left 111,000 homeless, tore through the centralPhilippines and into the South China Sea today.   Coast guard officials said the 2,845-ton Dona Marilyn sankMonday in the Visayas Sea, about 300 miles southeast of Manila. Itwas not clear how many people were lost.   Lt. Rey Esguerra of the coast guard station in Cebu saidrescuers found 11 survivors on Maripipi Island and another smallisland and that four people were found floating in the water.   Esguerra later said the search was suspended because of darknessand bad weather, but would resume at dawn Wednesday.   The Dona Marilyn was carrying 451 passengers and 60 crew membersfrom Manila to Tacloban on Leyte Island when it radioed a distresscall, said Carlos Go, general manager of Sulpicio Lines, owner ofthe vessel.   Others missing and feared dead from Typhoon Ruby included 25 inthe Mindanao Island coastal city of Cagayan de Oro, 15 inMindanao's Zamboanga del Sur province and about 70 aboard a busthat plunged into a swollen river Monday.   Ruby lashed the main Philippine island, Luzon, with torrentialrains and wind gusts of up 140 mph.   The storm caused widespread flooding on the island, triggeringlandslides and washing away bridges. Agriculture Secretary CarlosDominguez said preliminary estimates showed Ruby caused $45.7million in crop damage.   President Corazon Aquino's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, said thesix-province Bicol region of southeastern Luzon was withoutelectricity today.   The weather service said Ruby's center passed about 50 mileseast of Manila and swept into the provinces of Tarlac, Bulacan andNueva Ecija, the Philippines' rice-producing heartland.   Government meteorologists said more than nine inches of rainfell at the Manila's airport in 24 hours.   Casualty and damage reports were incomplete because of poorcommunications. Figures compiled from the Red Cross and variousgovernment agencies showed 26 dead in Antique province, 15 inZamboanga del Sur province, 11 in Cagayan de Oro, 11 in Marikina,six on Camiguin island, three in Nueva Ecija, two in Surigao City,and one each in Pampanga province and Bulacan.   In Zamboanga, two Philippine navy ships _ a landing ship and ahospital vessel _ sank Monday after being battered by heavy waves.There were no casualties.   Power outages and widespread flooding hit Manila early today asRuby approached. Schools, government offices, Manila's two stockexchanges and many private businesses were closed as strong windsbuffeted the capital.   Most domestic flights from Manila's airport were canceled againtoday, but airport officials said international service was normal.   The Department of Social Welfare said at least 110,000 of thenation's 23 million people were left homeless by the storm.   Schools were closed at the American bases and the U.S. militarytelevision station said only essential personnel were on duty.   Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark Air Base, 50 miles northof Manila, reported no major structural damage, but said someaircraft were evacuated to an undisclosed ``safe location.''   Ruby was the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to hit thePhilippines this year and was the strongest typhoon to hit Luzonsince Patsy, which killed at least 175 people in 1970.   Rodrigo Roldan, civil defense director on Panay Island, saidMonday at least five people were killed when a bus careened off abridge during heavy winds and rain, and plunged into a river.   But today, Roldan said 18 people had been rescued but no bodiesfound. He said the bus may have carried up to 90 passengers, mostof whom were either trapped inside or were swept away by floodwaters.</TEXT></DOC>
