After the Hollywood siren announced two years ago shewould buy the town for $20 million, some folks rushed out torent her movies so they would recognize her when she strolledinto the Braselton Bros. Super Market. Others waited eagerlyfor her to open a movie studio, restore the old blacksmithshop and gristmill and start tempting tourists from nearbyInterstate Highway 85. Some people even thought the37-year-old star of &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;9 1/2 Weeks&quot; would buildherself a mansion in their one-stoplight town.</LP><TEXT>   But so far, there is little sign of change in Braselton,population 500. And to make matters worse, there is no signof Kim.   Ms. Basinger, in partnership with the pension fund ofAmeritech Corp., the Chicago-based telecommunicationscompany, closed the real-estate deal in January of 1990 in anAtlanta hotel. (The fund's share is undisclosed.) Since then,the part she has played has been that of an absentee landladywith increasingly testy tenants. The actress had to bereplaced on the board of the $5.5 million Braselton BankingCo. because she wasn't attending meetings, and Mayor HenryEdward Braselton, whose family sold her the bank and most ofthe real estate in town, is still waiting to bestow thetraditional municipal honors.   &quot;We've got a key all ready for her,&quot; he says. &quot;We justhaven't been able to get her out here to pick it up.&quot;   &quot;She's pretty,&quot; adds David Higgins, who lives with hismother, grandmother and eight cats in a Basinger-owned house(rent: $70 a month). &quot;But she ain't done much for peoplearound here.&quot;   Braselton, to borrow a real-estate euphemism, is afixer-upper with lots of potential. In 1887, the originalBraselton boys opened a tiny general store here, about 45miles northeast of Atlanta. Over the decades, the town grewinto a bustling center for cotton trading, corn and wheatmilling and -- if the Braseltons weren't looking --occasional moonshining.   But the descendants of the original clan grew old, andtheir businesses and buildings began to decay. Today, threebrick storefronts -- Braselton Hardware, Braselton Furnitureandamp; Appliances and the supermarket -- are still intact. But therest of the town is a cross between &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;: Two stately mansions stand besidehomes with crumbling porches and sagging roofs.   Ms. Basinger entered the picture in 1987, after Braseltonfamily members put their holdings up for sale. The dealincluded 18 rented homes, about 30 other buildings, and somevacant land. (The town government provides municipalservices.) The actress, who grew up in nearby Athens andwhose parents are still there, has been fuzzy about herreasons for buying &quot;God's little 2,800 acres,&quot; as shedescribed it to Movieline magazine. (It's actually 1,700acres.) An early Basinger press release said Braselton wouldlet her rekindle childhood memories of &quot;small-town warmth,inviting lazy summer afternoons and . . . bindingfriendships.&quot;   Ms. Basinger's only public appearance in Braselton came in1989, soon after she agreed to buy the town, when she made anunannounced, 90-minute tour of the local Mitsubishi TV andtelephone plant, signing autographs and chatting withdumbstruck workers. Mitsubishi isn't one of her tenants.Since then, the closest she has come to making contact withthe town's residents is mailing autographed black-and-whitephotos to a few people. Terry Kitchens, 35, who has anauto-repair shop in a Basinger-owned building, has one withthe inscription: &quot;The best-looking mechanic in Braselton,&quot;supplied by her representative. But the mechanic has nevermet the actress.   More common are various &quot;Kim sightings.&quot; One report hasMs. Basinger dropping in by helicopter to dine privately at anearby winery. Another has her riding through town in a ChevySuburban. The Barretts, who live on Route 53, swear thestarlet pulled up to their house last summer in a whitelimousine and had her chauffeur step out and buy acantaloupe. That made the local paper.   Townspeople have gamely tried to snare the real Kim,reasoning that her family lives just 20 miles away in Athens.But Jackson County Elementary School couldn't get her toaddress departing eighth graders, and Sam Sloan, manager ofthe Braselton Inn, can't get her to take part in afive-kilometer charity run.   &quot;I would schedule it anytime to fit her convenience,&quot; saysthe still-hopeful Mr. Sloan, who keeps a &quot;Welcome KimBasinger&quot; sign on his marquee.   Ms. Basinger's defenders, including one of the mayor'sdaughters and the real-estate agent who handled the sale,point out that the actress has a busy schedule, what with twoalbums and three movies in the works, plus pantyhose ads andpromotional appearances. (Ms. Basinger's representativesdidn't make the actress available for comment.) So Ms.Basinger leaves most details of developing Braselton to MickBasinger, her brother and spokesman.   At a recent press conference in Braselton, Mr. Basingersaid a soft real-estate market and an overloaded town sewersystem -- not lack of interest by his sister -- are holdingup plans to develop the town. He said she hopes eventually toput in shops, restaurants, a recording studio and maybe atheme park or golf course, or both. Mr. Basinger insists thathis sister has been here many times, to meet with bankers anddevelopers. But the visits aren't publicized, he says, toavoid chaos.   &quot;You have to understand from Kim's perspective,&quot; Mr.Basinger says. &quot;It's uncomfortable. She works her tail off toget to the position she's in, and then she has to wearsunglasses to disguise herself.&quot;   The explanations, however, do little to mollify residents.Indeed, a sort of Basinger backlash has been brewing here,where many residents already had their suspicions about herfor reportedly dating Prince, the black rock star, andundeniably posing nude for Playboy.   Upon learning of her spread in Playboy, one old-timer, whoruns a local business, says he was so incensed he withdrewhis money from Braselton Bank. The city council, controlledby the Braselton family, recently blocked the Basinger groupfrom demolishing two decaying buildings pending a historicaland architectural study. And even 11-year-old Chris Howardnow frets that &quot;Batman's&quot; co-star may turn his home intoGotham City.   &quot;I like Braselton the way it is,&quot; he says. &quot;You can gooutside and not worry about being kidnapped or anything. Ifshe gets all these people from Hollywood to come in, we'llhave to worry about that stuff.&quot;   With each passing month, the Hollywood star and her staidlittle Georgia town seem to drift farther apart. December:Ms. Basinger is reported to have sold her $1 millionHollywood Hills cottage because she almost never used it;Braselton drafts a $90,700 annual budget. January: Ms.Basinger denies a magazine report that she threw tempertantrums on a movie set and demanded to fly to Brazil to seea psychic; Kit Braselton travels to Albany, Ga., to have hisneck examined by his doctor nephew. February: Ms. Basingertells Cosmopolitan magazine, &quot;I don't really live in a timezone. I don't abide by the rules here on Earth&quot;; Braselton'sLions Club, over fried chicken, coleslaw and blueberries,hears plans for a membership telethon.   Still, Ms. Basinger can probably expect a warm receptionhere if she returns. Consider Mr. Kitchens, who runs the autoshop. He gets giddy at the thought of being face to face withthe blonde screen temptress who apparently considers him thebest-looking mechanic in Braselton.   &quot;I want to meet her, but I don't know if I could handleit,&quot; Mr. Kitchens confides. &quot;If I was a racing engine, I'dprobably get over-revved and blow up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
