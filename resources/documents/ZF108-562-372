Van NameandM;and Bill CatchingsandM;SQL-based database servers offer the promise of a corporate informationresource.andP;  They can realize their potential only if users find it just aseasy to enter and retrieve data from these servers as from their localPC-based database-management system (DBMS).andM;Therefore, in addition to a strong database engine and a good applicationprogramming interface, these Structured Query Language (SQL)-based serversneed good forms-generation and report-writing tools.andM;PC Week examined two OS/2 database servers that meet this dual requirement:Gupta Technologies Inc.'s SQLBase Server 4.0.1, including its DOS clientsystem, SQLWindows 1.2.1; and IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition 1.2 DatabaseManager.andP;  (For a general review of the OS/2 Database Manager, see PC Week,June 11, Page 78.)andM;PC Week tested these products by building a variety of data-entry, update andretrieval forms, as well as several one- and two-table reports.andP;  All of theforms and reports ran against a custom database.andM;At first glance, these two products appear quite similar, but looks can bedeceiving.andP;  True, they both rely heavily on an underlying menu-basedgraphical user interface -- the OS/2 Presentation Manager for the DatabaseManager and Microsoft Windows for SQLWindows -- to provide users with suchdevelopment aids as fill-in-the-blank pop-up windows, drop-down menus andmouse operation.andP;  They also provide the same three basic facilities: agraphical query mechanism, a forms builder and a report writer.andP;  However, theproducts approach their tasks quite differently.andM;First, IBM's Query Manager, the part of the Database Manager that providesits forms-building and report-writing features, runs only on OS/2 systems,although it can work transparently with either remote or local DatabaseManager databases.andM;SQLWindows, by contrast, runs only on DOS-based PCs operating under MicrosoftWindows.andP;  It, too, can work either with local databases -- courtesy of abundled DOS version of Gupta's database engine -- or with Gupta's OS/2SQLBase Server.andM;The Query Manager follows an everything-under-one-roof philosophy.andP;  Its mainmenu leads to the query, forms-building and report-writing options.andP;  Allthree functions are tightly linked during applications development.andP;  Forexample, the query screens define which data items will appear on reports.andM;The Query Manager is best-suited for novices or infrequent users who mightappreciate the slow pace and hand-holding feel of its completely menu-driveninterface.andP;  Developers familiar with other forms-building and report-writingpackages, however, may get frustrated with the interface.andM;Gupta's SQLWindows, on the other hand, is best for programmers willing tolearn the proprietary development languages at the core of its form andreport tools.andP;  Though novices should be able to get started easily with someof the SQLWindows tools, they may find the underlying language cryptic anddifficult to use.andM;Gupta's SQLWindows is a not a single program but rather a collection of fivevery different programs bundled together.andP;  The core program, SQLWindows,provides the tools for building on-screen forms and reports.andM;Two novice-oriented programs, Express Windows and Express Edit, offer asubset of SQLWindows' creation and editing functions, respectively, insimpler packages.andP;  The query mechanism, SQLTalk, is yet another program.andO;Finally, while these four programs are Windows applications, the main toolfor producing printed reports, SQR, does not even run under Windows.andM;The two products also take different approaches to data exchange, althoughboth can import and export ASCII and Lotus 1-2-3 file formats.andM;PC Week tested the server portions of these products on a Northgate ComputerSystems Inc.andP;  486/25 system, and the client portions on an Advanced LogicResearch Inc.andP;  FlexCache 25386 machine.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
