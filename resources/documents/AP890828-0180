(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trialopened Monday with a federal prosecutor accusing the TV evangelistof fleecing followers he considered ``tacky'' so that he could livein high style.   A former aide testified that the founder of the PTL televisionministry said he ``wanted to be paid like Johnny Carson'' and toldhim how top ministry executives took a cut from the money theyraised.   But Bakker's lawyer said in his opening argument that the founderof the PTL television ministry was ``a creative, religious genius''who is unfairly accused.   Prosecutors say Bakker and other executives at the evangelicalempire diverted for their own benefit at least $4 million of the$158 million they raised by selling ``lifetime partnerships'' at theministry's resort hotels.   If convicted of all 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakkercould be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million.   ``Have a nice day'' was all the 49-year-old evangelist said as heentered the courthouse.   Meanwhile, Bakker's wife, Tammy, carried on with their newbroadcast from Orlando, Fla., asking viewers to pray for Bakker. Shesaid she wanted to have the ``Jim and Tammy Show'' on the air so``Jim will have something to come home to.''   Bakker quit PTL amid revelations about his 1980 sexual encounterwith church secretary Jessica Hahn and a $265,000 payoff to her.   Outside the courthouse Monday, the opening of the trial wasmarked by reporters and spectators vying for seats in the smallcourt, and two men carrying signs denouncing Bakker and severalother broadcast evangelists.   ``We just want people to know God isn't playing games. Anybodywho reads the Bible knew that (PTL) wasn't right,'' said BobEckhardt of Columbia, S.C.   A young woman and a man sold hip-hugging ``Bible Belts,'' beltsadorned with small Bibles.   A jury was chosen last week. The first witness, David Taggart, aformer personal assistant to Bakker, testified that Bakker wasinvolved daily in details of the ministry's fund-raising, ``whetherhe was on vacation or not.''   Taggart and his brother James, PTL's interior decorator, wereconvicted last month of tax evasion. Each faces 25 years in prisonand $1 million in fines at sentencing Sept. 8.   Taggart, the only witness Monday, said he testified because ``itmight have some impact on my sentencing.''   Taggart said Bakker also told him top PTL executives divertedfunds for their own use. ``He said some fund-raisers got up to 10percent of what they took in,'' Taggart said.   Under Bakker's orders, Taggart spent more than $500,000 in PTLmoney to purchase and decorate a condominium for the Bakker familyin Highland Beach, Fla., in 1982. Taggart testified that PTLdirectors did not approve the expenditure until several months later.   Bakker complained about salary, Taggart testified. ``I rememberMr. Bakker saying he wanted to be paid like Johnny Carson,'' he said.   Taggart said that during Bakker's last 15 months at PTL, January1986 to March 1987, the minister received nearly $1 million inbonuses from the PTL board, including a $500,000 Christmas bonus inNovember 1986 and a $100,000 Christmas gift that December.   He told the jury about gold-plated faucets in Bakker'sfour-bedroom, six-bath suite at a hotel at Heritage USA, PTL'sChristian theme park in Fort Mill, S.C., and about gold faucets inBakker's office suite bathrooms and his home.   Taggart also testified that Bakker personally approved using PTLmoney to pay Hahn to keep quiet about their sexual encounter.   Deborah Smith, a Justice Department special prosecutor, askedTaggart if Bakker ever discussed the holders of PTL partnerships.   ``I recall Mr. Bakker looking out the window over the water parkand Heritage Grand Hotel and complaining that the partners weredumb,'' he said. ``He said they would block the buses that werecoming into the lobby and they would wear their wet bathing suits inthe lobby of the hotel.''   Taggart was to take the stand again Tuesday.   The prosecution says PTL raised $158 million from 1984 to 1987 bypromising $1,000 donors three nights' lodging per year for life inhotels at Heritage USA. During those years, Bakker and his wife drew$3.5 million in bonuses plus other perks, prosecutors said.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller said the ``case is aboutcheating people out of their money, tricking people out of theirmoney by the use of the mails, telephone and television.''   Miller told jurors the money paid for ``a lavish lifestyle mostof you won't be able to identify with,'' including $100,000 for aprivate jet to take the Bakkers' clothing to California. Miller saidthe Bakkers had two Rolls Royces and four Mercedes cars, includingone used only to drive Bakker's 12-year-old son from place to place.   Miller said that on one occasion, the Bakkers, delighted by thesmell of cinnamon buns from a bakery during a trip, sent a securityguard to the store to buy $100 worth of the rolls so they couldsmell them in their hotel suite.   ``Three days later, with not a bite taken out of any of them, thesecurity guard tossed them out,'' Miller said.   ``You will hear evidence of Mr. Bakker's disdain for the peoplehe was asking to send money,'' Miller said. ``You will hear how hedescribed them as tacky because of the way they dressed.''   Defense attorney George T. Davis said Bakker didn't ``sell''anything. ``What happened was gifts or donations. This was achurch,'' Davis told the jury.   Davis blamed problems at PTL on trusted lieutenants and notedthat former PTL vice president Richard Dortch and the Taggartbrothers are convicted felons.   Dortch pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in exchangefor testimony against Bakker. He was sentenced last week to eightyears in prison and fined $200,000.</TEXT></DOC>
