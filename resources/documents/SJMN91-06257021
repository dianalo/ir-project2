Instead of a shiny newshow, the syndicated revival of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; is meant to be acomfortable old one that viewers slide into as easily as their favorite pairof slippers.;   Why, there's the Big Guy and Mamma and Herb and Les. Johnnyand Jennifer even show up for a bit.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TV'S FAVORITE RADIO STATION GOES BACK ON THE AIR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Television  </MEMO><TEXT>     Is this live or is it Memorex, 1991 or 1978? You're excused if you can'ttell the difference, because that's the whole idea.;   You're obviously notsupposed to tell the difference between the original WKRP and this one, atleast not yet -- and therein lies the pleasure and the pitfalls of revivingone of the best sitcoms of its time, which, for those who may have forgotten,was 1978-82.;   Ever since, of course, it's been rolling around the dial inreruns, racking up big numbers and making CBS look like an even bigger clodthan it did at the time for moving the show around so often and then cancelingit after only five seasons. It could, and certainly should, have run muchlonger, and anyone who watched it for more than an episode knew that.;   Sonow, nearly a decade after the fact, someone's trying to do the right thing bybringing it back.;   Pardon me if I'm still not quite sure that it's going towork, but I think so.;   It's just that in the two-part opener, we don't getmuch of a feel for the new folks at the station, and without knowing howthey'll work out it's hard to say how the show will work out.;   But there'scertainly not much here to discourage anyone who liked the old show, exceptperhaps remembering when -- and where -- it's on.;   In fact, this one startsout much the way the first one did, with a new program director named DonovanAderhold (Mykelti Williamson) coming in to try to pick up the pieces in thewake of previous misdeeds, just as Andy Travis did years ago.;   The problemthen was a format too anemic for Geritol. The problem now is language toonasty for 2 Live Crew. It got the program director fired and Mr. Carlson(Gordon Jump) arrested -- an event Les (Richard Sanders) covered with hisusual aplomb.;   &quot;This reporter, for one, sees the arrest of Mr. Carlson as astep in the right direction,&quot; Les says into his ever-present tape recorder,after having jabbed the mike into his boss' face as he was being carted off.;  Well, it's a joke in the right direction anyway.;   This new WKRP has plentyof them, many recycled from the old days. Mr. Carlson is still confused. Lesis still clumsy and still pining for an office with walls. Herb (Frank Bonner)is still horny and badly dressed. Mama (Carol Bruce) still wants to sell thestation.;   In fact, she says she's done that, which is where Johnny andJennifer (Howard Hesseman and Loni Anderson, making guest appearances) come induring the second episode.;   &quot;I thought I'd never see you again,&quot; a stunnedHerb mutters when Jennifer returns.;   &quot;I thought so, too,&quot; she replies,dejectedly.;   Later, Johnny tells the new program director, &quot;Twenty yearsago, I got fired for saying 'booger' on the air. Look what you have to say toget fired today.&quot;;   Yes, the world has changed. But WKRP hasn't, even if ithas some new folks around.;   A woman named Ronnie (Wendy Davis) has replacedJennifer as receptionist. Claire Hartline (Hope Alexander-Willis) is thetraffic manager, a key radio post the old station never seemed to have.;   Thenew morning team is the bickering former husband and wife duo of Burns(Kathleen Garrett) and Allen (Michael Des Barres), while the new evening jockand series bombshell is the appropriately named Mona Loveland (Tawny Kitaen).;  All of these folks and the new program director show up in the first twoepisodes, but none has a very big part yet. Presumably when Johnny andJennifer take their leave, these roles will increase, and we'll get to knowthe new characters as well as we did Venus and Bailey and Travis.;   If not,&quot;WKRP&quot; could just be one more empty exercise in nostalgia.;   Chances are,however, with such quality people as Bill Dial and Max Tash from the old daysbehind the camera, the same amiably zany feel will be recreated in front ofit.;   Which means WKRP should still be the place to tune for radio fun, evenif you have to turn on television to find it.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  David Rosenthal column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910913  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  765  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 13, 199100257021,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
