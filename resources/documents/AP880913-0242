Compaq Computer Corp. and a host of others, includingHewlett-Packard Co., Tandy Corp., Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co.SpA, Japan's NEC Corp. and Epson America Inc., and Zenith DataSystems, are rallying around an alternative to the Micro Channelfound inside the more expensive models of IBM's Personal System-2.   The rivals say their ``bus,'' which controls the way informationis passed between components of a computer, is a simpler and lessdisruptive transition from the bus of the AT personal computer thanIBM's Micro Channel is.   The new bus, dubbed EISA, for Extended Industry StandardArchitecture, was unveiled today at a New York news conference.   The companies expect that the first products incorporating thenew bus will begin to emerge in late 1989, said Rod Canion, thepresident and chief executive of Compaq.   Other companies pledging support to the new standard were IntelCorp., the chip maker, Microsoft Corp., the software company, andseveral leading makers of communications equipment and software.   ``I think it (EISA) will be a problem for IBM,'' Norman Weizer,an analyst at Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., saidMonday. ``I think IBM did misguess as to how closely its technologywould be followed.''   Even IBM has acknowledged that not all customers want its newMicro Channel. The cheaper members of its Personal System-2 linedon't have it, and IBM was expected to unveil two more of thosemodels today.   The new machines will use the same microprocessor as IBM's oldAT and will be aggressively priced.   IBM fears uncontrolled copying of its technology, which wouldkeep it from preventing shoddy knock-offs and deprive it oflicensing payments to defray the expense of its research anddevelopment.   But if no other company copies the internal design of the newPersonal System-2 line, it won't become an industry standard andsoftware developers won't create many programs for it. Without goodsoftware available, customers won't want to buy the machine.   IBM's competitors say there is no good reason for computerbuyers to adopt the Micro Channel.   Analysts say EISA will speed up the movement of information butstill allow computers to use older add-on equipment, such as memorycards, graphics cards and data storage devices.   Customers buying IBM's PS-2 have to buy all new add-onequipment, although there is less need for it because there aremore built-in features.   There is little IBM can do about the rival effort except try toconvince computer users that its design offers more room for growthin the long run.   Even if IBM's Micro Channel ultimately prevails, the new busfrom the rival coalition is likely to slow down the development ofnew programs by fragmenting the efforts of software developers.   Software developers may prefer to concentrate their efforts onprograms for computers that don't use Micro Channel, especially ifthe new bus gives them a new lease on life, said Bruce L. Davis,chairman of the Software Publishers Association.   ``The question is whether we need to make the technological leapto the Micro Channel Architecture right now,'' said Davis, who isalso president and chief executive of Mediagenic in Menlo Park,Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
