Brown, head of WorldwatchInstitute.   ``With more hungry people in the world today than when thisdecade began, there's little to celebrate on the food front as weenter the '90s,'' he said.   Brown, in a World Watch magazine report released Saturday, saidhe sees no sure-fire way to boost global food production enough inthe 1990s to keep pace with expected population growth.   ``The only reasonable goal will be to try and cut (populationgrowth) in half by the end of the century, essentially what Japandid in the '50s and what China did in the '70s,'' he said.   But reaching that goal will be ``perhaps more demanding thananything the international community has ever undertaken,'' Brownadded.   ``For the United States, the obvious first step is to restore itsfunding of the United Nations Population Fund and InternationalPlanned Parenthood Federation, which was canceled several years agoin response to pressures from the political right,'' he said.   The United States halted its support for the U.N. agency in 1986.   ``Given the link between population growth and environmentaldegradation, President George Bush cannot credibly call himself anenvironmentalist if funding is not resumed,'' Brown said. ``In theprocess, the United States could reinvigorate the internationalfamily planning effort.''   Last May, the United Nations Population Fund said that unlesswomen win more access to birth control, education and employment,the world's population could almost triple to 14 billion by the year2100.   Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. agency, said theworld's population, now at 5.2 billion, may be held to 10 billion inthe next century if family planners succeed in reducing birth rates.   In pulling its funding for the U.N. agency, the Reaganadministration contended it promoted coercive abortion, but Mrs.Sadik said the reasons were political. She said movements such asreligious fundamentalism ``seem to be designed to somehow keep womenin bondage.''   She expressed hope the Bush administration would resume the U.S.contribution.   However, the Bush administration has continued Reagan's policy ofnot funding the agencies based on the idea that no federal fundsshould be spent for population control that involves abortion.   Brown, whose private, non-profit Worldwatch Institute for yearshas espoused population control as part of its research and policyrecommendations, said some progress has been made in scaling backbirth rates, from about 2 percent annually in 1970 to 1.7 percentthis year.   However, this decline has been so slow the annual incrementalincrease is actually going up, he said. The world is now projectedto add 921 million people during the 1990s, the largest incrementever for a decade.   ``In many developing countries, soaring population now has a dualeffect on food balance,'' Brown said. ``It increase demand as itdegrades the agricultural resource base.   ``For instance, crowded cities and villages create a need forfirewood that exceeds the sustainable yield of local forests.Deforestation is the outcome, which in turn increases rainfallrunoff and soil erosion.''   Brown said soil erosion tops the list of enviromental trends thatthreaten humankind. Other hazards include air pollution's damage tocrops and its long-term effect on climate.   Last year's drought in the United States and its lingeringeffects in some areas reduced world grain output. Even with largercrops this year, global stockpiles are still short, Brown said.   With reduced output, world grain prices rose by roughly one-halffrom July 1987 to July 1988 and have remained relatively high since,he said.   ``For many heavily indebted Third World countries, rising grainprices are combining with falling personal incomes to pose a policydilemma,'' Brown said. ``Price hikes are needed to stimulate outputand encourage additional investment by farmers, but the world's poorcan't cope easily.   ``Perhaps a billion or more of the world's people already spend70 percent of their income on food. For many in this group, adramatic rise in the cost of grain is life threatening.''   In the United States, a $1 loaf of bread contains only about fivecents worth of wheat. If the price of wheat were to double, theprice of the loaf would increase to only $1.05, Brown said. But inpoor countries, where wheat is bought at local markets and groundinto flour at home, a doubling of wheat prices means a doubling ofbread prices.   ``A food price rise that is merely annoying to the world'saffluent can drive consumption below the survival level among thepoor,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
