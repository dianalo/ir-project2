Next, which was started by Steven Jobs, co-founder ofApple Computer Inc., unveiled an operating software systemyesterday that allows PCs with high-speed Intel Corp.microprocessors to mimic the look of Next's workstations.Next's aim is to use its strongest suit -- its software -- totap into the huge market for machines based on Intel's chips.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're now becoming a software company as well as ahardware company,&quot; said Mr. Jobs in an interview. Nextbuyers, especially in corporations, have been urging Next torewrite its Nextstep workstation operating software to run onPCs, he said. &quot;We finally saw the light.&quot;   To spread the light on its new products, Next has placedlarge advertisements today in some editions of The WallStreet Journal and has scheduled other ads to run in thetrade press as part of its normal advertising program.   The new software reproduces the Next machine's &quot;graphicaluser interface&quot; -- the collection of symbols and windows onthe screen -- on a PC that uses a fast version of Intel's&quot;486&quot; microprocessor. The program, with a list price of $995,will allow a PC to run slightly altered Next applicationssoftware at about the same speed as a Next machine. Nextexpects the program to be on the market in the third quarter.   The new program, called Nextstep 486, is part of Next'sstrategy of wooing corporate and government buyers to itsmachines. Such buyers made up 81% of Next sales last year, upfrom about 50% in 1990, Mr. Jobs said. But some companieswere reluctant to buy Next machines because the softwaredoesn't run on machines made by any other vendor, he said.   Next's PC software &quot;will give them more credibility&quot; amongcustomers, said Vicki Brown, an analyst at International DataCorp., a research firm. Nexstep is &quot;the crown jewels of thecompany; it's the way they've won a lot of business away fromSun {Microsystems}.&quot;   Next also unveiled faster and lower-cost versions of itsworkstations and a new version of its Nextstep operatingsoftware, which it expects to ship in the second quarter of1992.   Separately, Next said its 1991 sales more than quadrupledto $127 million from $28 million in 1990. Whilefourth-quarter sales of $33 million fell well short of Next'sexpections of about $50 million, sales were very strong inDecember, said Michael Slade, Next's executive director ofmarketing. International sales accounted for about 43% ofrevenue, he said. Closely held Next, Redwood City, Calif.,doesn't disclose its earnings.</TEXT></DOC>
