The bill was sent to the full House Appropriations Committee byvoice vote Tuesday without action on any anti-obscenity amendmentsthat would restrict the kinds of art eligible for tax-paidendowment grants.   Debate on separate legislation to extend the NEA's life for fiveyears has been postponed until after the August recess because ofthe large number of amendments to be considered.   Republicans are drafting proposals for a drastic overhaul of theendowment as a result of past financial support for art that somehave denounced as obscene or sacrilegious.   The appropriations bill approved by the subcommittee Tuesdaywould provide a 5 percent increase in the NEA budget, from $171.3million to $180 million in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.   At the urging of Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., the subcommitteechairman and a staunch arts advocate, the panel approved boostingendowment funds for states arts councils from $26.1 million to $27million.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>No Increase in Disciplinary Action Against Physicians in 1988</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A consumer group says the same number ofphysicians were disciplined by state medical boards in 1988 as theyear before, reversing a trend toward more sanctions.   Public Citizen Health Research Group said Tuesday it arrived atthe number of 1,489 from an analysis of the most recent datacompiled by the Federation of State Medical Boards.   It counted license revocations or suspensions and probations.   In 1984, serious actions were taken against 745 physicians,Public Citizen said. That increased to 1,089 in 1985 and 1,277 in1986.   The group said none of the rates were high enough.   ``A physician could still operate drunk, commit a gross act ofnegligence, or sexually assault a patient and receive a mere slapon the wrist from his or her state's medical board in moststates,'' the group said.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>UPS Negotiations Could Force Mail Changes</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Postal Service may limit the number ofpackages it accept at one time to avoid being overloaded in casethere is a strike at rival United Parcel Service.   ``If there is a (work) stoppage next week there is no way (thePostal Service) can absorb the operations of UPS overnight into oursystem,'' Deputy Postmaster General Michael S. Coughlin saidTuesday.   However, he said any restrictions would affect only to volumeshippers. Individuals sending four or fewer parcels at one timewould not be impacted.   Individuals or organizations needing to send five or morepackages will be required to contact the postal service bytelephone to make a reservation to bring their parcels to a postalhandling center in the region of the intended delivery, he said.   For example, if a company in Chicago wanted to send truck loadsof parcels to customers in Atlanta, it would make a reservation todeliver the parcels to the postal facility in Atlanta. The companysending the packages would be responsible for getting them fromChicago to Atlanta, and the Postal Service would then complete thedelivery to homes.</TEXT></DOC>
