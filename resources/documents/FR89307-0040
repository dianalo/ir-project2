Several revisions to NFIP floodplain management criteria are proposed that are intended to clarify orfurther explain provisions in those criteria or which liberalize certainrequirements. Since this is a case, communities participating in the NFIPwill not be required to amend their flood plain management regulationsto incorporate the revised language. However, if a community has had difficultiesin administering a provision, that community would be encouraged to amendits regulations accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="84">Substantial Improvement </ITAG>A number of revisions are proposed to the definition of ``substantial improvement''in andSection; 59.1. These revisions are the result of an ongoing study byFEMA on issues related to the implementation of the ``substantial improvement''definition and are intended to clarify portions of that definition. Inaddition to these revisions, FEMA is presently developing further guidanceto assist communities in administering substantial improvement. Substantialimprovements of existing structures must meet nearly all of the same floodplain management requirements as new construction. The proposed revision address three areas that have been identified asbeing in need of clarification including, (1) substantially damaged structures,(2) historic structures, and (3) cost exemptions for correcting health,safety and sanitary code related violations. Substitutions and deletionsof terminology are also proposed to make the definition fully consistentwith other NFIP definitions and existing FEMA policy, and to account forthe revisions in the three areas.There have been issues raised regarding the interpretation of the substantialimprovement definition where a building has been substantially damagedand is either not fully repaired, or is repaired using discounted or donatedmaterials and labor. The proposed rule explicitly defines a building asbeing substantially damaged when it sustains damage from any cause, wherebythe cost of fully restoring the structure to its before damaged conditionwould equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure beforedamage occurred. There have been instances where structures have been substantially damagedand not fully repaired. Some communities have determined that the repairof these structures is not a substantial improvement because they believedthat the cost of repair was less than 50 percent of the structure's marketvalue. While this is contrary to FEMA's interpretation of the definition,it is not unreasonable given the ambiguities in the current definition.In essence, the reference to repair costs in the substantial improvementdefinition means the repair of <T3>all </T3>damages sustained and thus cannot reflect a level of repairswhich is less than the amount of damages suffered. A building which sustainsdamages exceeding 50 percent of its market value will be subject to thesubstantial improvement rule, even if the actual cost of the repairs performedis reduced below the 50 percent threshold. Thus, the ``cost of repair''used in determining repair cost to market value ratios shall be equal tothe combined <T3>value </T3>of materials and labor used <T3>or necessary </T3>in repairing <T3>all </T3>damages sustained by a building, but in no case, shall beless than the value of materials and labor necessary to restore the buildingto its pre-damaged condition. The value of ``materials'' shall be equal or equivalent to the actual orestimated cost of all materials, to be used or considered necessary inrepairing all damages sustained by a building, and shall be no less thanthat required to restore the building to its pre-damaged condition. Wherematerials or servicing equipment are donated or discounted below normalmarket values, the value should be adjusted to an amount which would beequivalent to that estimated for normal market transactions for a givengeographic location. The value of ``labor'' shall be equal or equivalent to the actual or estimatedlabor charge for repair of all damages to the structure. Where non-reimbursedlabor is involved (self or donated labor), the value of labor for the non-reimbursableportions shall be computed based on applicable hourly wage scales adjustedfor a given geographic location and the type and skill of the labor involved.Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the community permit official toassure that the cost of repair estimates provided or obtained reasonablyreflect the value of damages sustained (or actual cost of repairs and improvementsif greater than the value of the damages). The underlying principle for including the costs associated with donatedlabor and materials is the added value of real property that would be locatedin flood hazard areas and that would be at risk to flood damage. It shouldbe noted that in some form, the Federal Government (the NFIP and variousdisaster assistance programs) would likely be obligated to pay a portionof or all future damages to these more expensive improvements. In estimating the ``cost of material'' for calculating substantial improvement,the costs of improvements required to remedy health, safety, and sanitarycode violations can be deducted under the current definition of substantialimprovement. However, there have been issues raised in the interpretationof substantial improvement in terms of the conditions of the code requirementsand the degree of improvements which qualify for these deductions. Current FEMA policy is that costs associated with improvements made toa structure are deductible from the overall costs of improvement<T3> only</T3> if the structure or specific items within the structurehave been previously identified by the local code enforcement officialas being substandard and in violation. If no official knowledge existedprior to the improvements, the local permit official has no way of knowingwhich items truly qualified as deductible and what the cost to repair orreplace these items may have been. Without documentation or knowledge onthe part of the permit official, the structure is assumed to have met allcodes prior to the improvements, and all costs of improvements would becounted toward substantial improvement. It is proposed that the substantial improvement definition be rewordedto explicitly state that the costs of improvements required to remedy codedeficiencies are deductible only if (1) an appropriate regulatory officialsuch as a building official, code enforcement officer, fire marshal, orhealth officer was informed about and knew the extent of the code relateddeficiencies and (2) the deficiency was in existence prior to the repairor improvement and not triggered solely by the fact that the structureis being improved. Consistent with current FEMA policy, for any improvement required to meethealth, sanitary, and safety codes, the proposed rule also provides thatonly the<T3> minimum</T3> necessary to assure safe living conditions shall be creditedas being deductible from the cost of the overall improvement. Costs ofimprovements which are in excess of the minimum necessary for continuedoccupancy or use will be counted toward the cost of the overall improvement.For example, if a certain feature of an item was in need of<T3> repairs</T3> to remedy a code violation, but the owner, of his ownvolition, chose to allocate additional funds to<T3> replace</T3> the entire item, then this additional cost would be countedsubstantial improvement and only the cost to perform the minimal necessaryrepairs would be deductible. The same policy applies when the owner choosesto use materials (or labor) that exceed the minimum expense for materials(or labor) necessary to remedy the code violation; the additional costassociated with the more expensive materials or labor would be countedtoward substantial improvement. As with donated labor and materials, the underlying principle for countingthe extra costs associated with more expensive materials, labor, or designsis the added value of real property that would be located in flood hazardareas and that would be at risk to flood damage. It should be noted thatin some form, the Federal Government (the NFIP and various disaster assistanceprograms) would likely be obligated to pay a portion of or all future damagesto these more expensive improvements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Historic Structures</ITAG>Presently, in both the NFIP variance procedures (andSection; 60.6) and thedefinition of substantial improvement (andSection; 59.1) there is a provisionwhich exempts ``any alteration of a structure listed on the National Registerof Historic Places or a State Inventory of historic places.'' Issues havebeen raised as to whether this exempting language can be modified to includestructures that are not individually listed on the National Register, butthat are located in a National, state or local historic district. In addition,the present exempting language is not fully consistent with the regulationsof the Department of Interior (DOI) which define and set criteria for certificationof historic structures. The proposed rule change would clarfiy the current definition of substantialimprovement and the procedures covering variances as they relate to theexemption of historic structures. This is to be done by including in theNFIP regulations, a separate definition for ``historic structure'' whichis consistent with, but broader and more ``inclusive than, the DOI definitonof ``certified historic structure''. In addition, language wuld be addedto andSection; 60.6(a) to clarify that variances granted to historic structuresshould be only the minimum deviation from NFIP criteria that is necessaryto assure that the historic character and design of the structure is notdestroyed.A ``Certified Historic Structure'' is defined by the DOI (36 CFR 67.2)as any building (and its structural components) which is listed individuallyin the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by theDOI); or, located in a ``registered historic district'' and ``certified''by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historic significanceof that district.The proposed NFIP definition of ``historic structure'' would include allstructures which have been officially designated by the DOI as ````certifiedhistoric structure'', but would go beyond this to include (a) structuresindividually listed on state inventories for states with historic preservationprograms that have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior under36 CFR 61.4 and (b) structures individually listed on local inventoriesfor communities with historic preservation programs that have been certifiedeither by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of theInterior under 36 CFR 61.5, or directly by the Secretary of the Interiorin states without approved programs.The original intent of providing special treatment to historic structureswas two-fold: First, to allow historic structures to always maintain Pre-FIRM,subsidized insurance rates and, second, to minimize the adverse impactsof NFIP requirements on historic structures. Therefore, the proposed rulemodifies andSection; 60.6(a) to stipulate that the variance be the minimumdeviation necessary to preserve both the historic character of the structureand its designation as a historic building.The granting of a variance should be based on a structure-by-structurereview to determine whether elevation (or floodproofing if a non-residentialstructure is involved) to or above the base flood elevation would destroythe historic character or design of the structure. If so, a variance forthat structure may be granted. Variances should never be granted for portionsof, or entire historic districts, but only for individual historic structures.For example, if elevation of a historic structure would destroy its characterand cause a loss of its DOI designation, a variance for the elevation requirementmay be considered. However, the owner of the structure should still berequired, in accordance with andSection; 60.6(a)(4), to elevate all utilitiesand finished interior workings to or above the BFE (or to the maximum extentpossible or practrically feasible) in order to reduce the potential offlood damage.Physical alternations made to a ``historic structure'' which would otherwiseconstitute a substantial improvement must not result in the delisting ofthe structure from its DOI certified, state, or local inventory status.If such alterations cause the structure to lose its official listing orhistoric status, the structure would no longer be a ``historic structure''for the purposes of the NFIP and would be considered a substantial improvementand must, therefore, comply with the NFIP requirements for new construction.For further background on the pertinent regulations, procedures and adoptednomenclature of the DOI as they pertain to historic structures see 36 CFR61.4, 61.5, 67.2, 67.4, 67.5, and 67.10.<ITAG tagnum="84">Start of Construction</ITAG>To make the definition of ``start of construction'' consistent with thedefinition of ``substantial improvement'', the second sentence in the currentsubstantial improvement definition, which defines the point at which initialconstruction of a substantial improvement begins would be moved to thestart of construction definition. In its place, a reference to ``startof construction'' would be added in the first sentence of the proposedsubstantial improvement definition. The actual start of construction forsubstantially improved structures would continue to mean the ``the firstalteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.''The term ``reconstruction'' has been deleted from the first sentence ofthe proposed definitions of ``start of construction'' and of ``substantialimprovement'' and the terms ``rehabilitation'' and ``addition'' have beensubstituted. It is felt tha the terms ``rehabilitation'' and ``addition''better describe the two types of improvements that actually occur to structures.This change is also consistent with current FEMA policy which, for thepurposes of substantial improvement, differentiates between rehabilitations(improvements to a structure without an increase in external dimensions)and additions (increases in square footage of a structure) in terms offloodplain management and insurance rating requirements.The term ``repair'' (due to damage) and the reference to market value ofdamaged structures would also be deleted from the first sentence of thesubstantial improvement definition because they are referenced in the proposeddefinition of ``substantial damage''.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Flood Plain Management Revisions</ITAG>In addition, four other minor changes are proposed to clarify certain provisionsof the regulations. First, the definition of ``new construction'' in andSection;59.1 would be modified to affirm current FEMA interpretation that the termapplies to any subsequent improvements to a structure which meets the definitionof ``new construction''. Occasionally, individuals have misinterpretedthe current definition and argued that it allows for improvements to thesestructures which are not compliant with standards in andSection; 60.3 providedthat the improvements are not ``substantial improvements''. FEMA has maintainedthat the ``substantial improvement'' definition applies only to existingstructures and that, once a structure meets the definition of ``new construction'',<T3>any </T3>further improvements to that structure must meet ``new construction''requirements. Any other interpretation would be inconsistent with the structureand intent of the regulations in their entirety. However, FEMA believesthat the fact that these misunderstandings of the definition have occurredis of sufficient concern to warrant clarification of the definition.Second, paragraph (c)(5) of andSection; 60.3 would be revised to make itclear that the openings requirement in that paragraph applies only to enclosuresthat are usable solely for vehicle parking, building access or storage.This would have to be the case since enclosures used for other uses wouldnot be excluded under the definition of ``lowest floor'' and would haveto be elevated to or above the base flood elevation or floodproofed (ifnon-residential). This change eliminates the need to refer back to thedefinition of ``lowest floor'' to draw this conclusion. Note that the typeof storage permitted in these enclosures is only that which is incidentaland accessory to the principal use of the structure. For instance, if thestructure is a residence, the storage in the enclosure should be limitedto items such as lawn and garden equipment, snow tires, and other low damageitems which cannot be conveniently stored in the elevated portion of thestructure. These items are likely to be flooded during more frequent floodevents. No flood insurance coverage is provided for these items under mostcircumstances.Third, the anchoring requirement for structures built on piles or columnsin coastal high hazard areas at andSection; 60.3(e)(4) and (e)(5) would berevised to replace a requirement that such structures be capable of resistingfloatation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effectsof wind and water loading from the one percent chance event. The proposedrevision instead references the wind loading values in applicable Stateand local building requirements.The reason for this change is that the original NFIP wind requirement wasbased on the 1972 version of the American National Standards Institute,Inc. (ANSI) standard. However, almost all State or local building codesnow base their wind requirements on the 1982 version of the ANSI standard,which increased the loading requirements and developed a new basic windspeed map, based on a ``50 year'' mean recurrence interval. Because ofthe difference in basis for the wind speed maps, it has sometimes beeninterpreted that the codes' use of the ``50 year'' wind map is in conflictwith FEMA's requirement that the ``100 year'' wind map be used. FEMA hasexamined this problem and has concluded that use of the new 1982 ANSI standardwith its increased loading requirements will result in a design which isas protecting as using the 1972 ANSI standard.Fourth, the definition of ``development'' in andSection; 59.1 would be modifiedto clarify situations covering the storage of equipment and material. Therehave been questions raised as to whether the open-air storage of equipmentand material constitutes ``development'' and whether certain stock-pileitems such as lumber and equipment (e.g., heavy machinery storage lots,automobile salvage yards, etc.) require a flood plain permit and shouldadhere to NFIP regulations under andSection; 60.3.``Development'' is currently defined as ``any man-made change to improvedor unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or otherstructures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, ordrilling operations''. The definition of ``development'' describes therange of flood plain activities which require a permit by the communityand which may increase flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood.For both communities which do not have designated floodways, and for thosethat do, development represents flood plain and floodway encroachmentsthat must adhere to NFIP regulations under andSection; 60.3(c)(10) and (d)(3),respectively.Actual situations in the file have resulted in commercial enterprises storingequipment or materials in the designated floodway. In one situation a companywas proposing to store lumber in the floodway. In another situation a companywas storing numerous pieces of heavy equipment such as bulldozers, roadgraders, and cranes in the floodway. These experiences have demonstratedto FEMA the need to further define development to include the storage ofequipment and material. Equipment or material stored on a site representsan encroachment which may increase flood levels during the base flood andmust, therefore, under the proposed rule be both permitted by the communityand considered during the application of andSection; 60.3(c)(10) and (d)(3).<ITAG tagnum="84">Revision of Base Flood Elevation Determinations</ITAG>The proposed rule expands andSection; 65.6(a)(6) by providing clarificationof the criteria for acceptable hydraulic or hydrologic methodologies submittedto FEMA as supporting data for a request to revise a base flood elevationdetermination. No new requirements for such methodologies are proposed.The flood risk data published on NFIP maps and in Flood Insurance Study(FIS) reports form the technical basis for the administration of the FNIPin each flood-prone community in the nation. These data provide the basisfor local floodplain management measures required for participation inthe NFIP, as well as the basis for actuarial flood insurance premiums.Although the preparation of NFIP maps and FIS reports is subject to rigoroustechnical standards, it is recognized that improvements in techniques usedto estimate flood risks, changes in physical conditions in flood plainsor watersheds, and availability of new technical data may necessitate revisionsof the maps and studies.In responding to new analyses submitted by appellants and in making suchrevisions, FEMA must exercise extreme care to ensure that all requestsare fully documented and well justified. Therefore, adequate supportingdata must be submitted. These data allow FEMA to review and evaluate therequests and to carry out its responsibility to ensure that the informationto be presented is scientifically and technically correct. The availabilityof these data and methodology documentation also ensure that the rightof the community and other property owners to review and appeal the newanalysis is not infringed upon. Finally, access to the data and methodsis necessary to update flood elevations and maps in an efficient manneras hydrologic or hydraulic conditions change in the future.The existing regulation at andSection; 65.6(a)(6) states: ``In order foran alternative hydraulic or hydrologic methodology to be accepted, anycomputer program used must be accepted for general use by a governmentalagency or notiable scientific body, must be well documented including auser's and programmer's manual, and must be available to the general user.''The proposed rule is intended to eliminate the confusion regarding certainterms used in this regulation.Specifically, the proposed rule includes an explanation of ``governmentalagency''. In the context of this provision, it means an agency of the FederalGovernment that is responsible for water resources activities. A non-inclusivelist of such agencies would consist of: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,U.S. Geological Survey, USDA Soil Conservation Service, Tennessee ValleyAuthority, and Bureau of Reclamation. ``Governmental agnecy'' does notembrace Federal agencies that do not have these responsibilities and doesnot include any governmental entity below the Federal level, whether theyhave these responsibilities or not.``Notable scientific body'' is explained in the proposed rule as an organizationcomparable to the National Academy of Sciences and is not intended to includeindividual universities and colleges.The proposed rule clarifies the requirement that a computer program beavailable to the general user. Language has been added to explain thatthe program must be in the public domain (i.e., nonproprietary). If a programsource code can be sent to FEMA free of charge with fully documented permissionfrom the owner that FEMA may release this information and the user's manualto whomever requests it, with only nominal charges to cover FEMA's costof reproducing these materials (i.e., photocopying the manuals and/or thecost of a magnetic tape or PC diskette), then FEMA will consider the programto be in the public domain.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mapping and Revision of Alluvial Fan Special Flood Hazard Areas</ITAG>The revisions to andSection; 59.1 and 65.13, setting forth FEMA's policyfor issuing Letters of MAP Amendment (LOMAs), Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs),Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) revisions, and conditional Letters of MapRevision (CLOMRs) for Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) on alluvial fansis necessary because of the high level of interest in development of alluvialfans and in anticipation of an increasing demand for map changes for areason alluvial fans.Alluvial fans are cone or fan-shaped deposits of boulders, gravel, sand,and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transportedby floodwater draining upsteam watersheds, and then deposited on the adjacentvalley floor. Active alluvial fans are areas of extreme hazard subjectto flash flood and high velocity flows. Unlike riverine flooding, thatis associated with permanent channels and identifiable flood plains, orunlike shallow flooding by slow-moving sheetflows, flooding that occurson alluvial fans is characterized by fast-moving debris and sediment-ladenshallow flows. The paths followed by these flows are prone to lateral migrationand sudden relocation to other portions of the fan. In addition, thesefast-moving flows present hazards associated with erosion, debris flow,and sediment transport.Alluvial fans occur in a variety of environments, particularly in arid,semi-arid or seasonally dry regions, where the sediment supply is largeenough that deposition can occur. Such locations are particularly commonalong faulted or tectonic mountain fronts in California, Colorado, Nevada,Utah, Oregon, Texas, Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, andWashington; however, alluvial fans are also found in Alaska, West Virginia,Kentucky, and Tennessee. Some of the fastest developing areas of the UnitedStates are in the arid and semi-arid southwestern regions, where alluvialfans occupy a large portion of the land area.For flood insurance purposes, FEMA has chosen the 100-year flood as thebase flood for the determination and mitigation of flood hazards and forsetting insurance rates. However, the technology of mathematically modelingthe hydrodynamics of water and debris flows on alluvial fans is still inthe early development stage. Therefore, the estimation of the values ofthe various hazard parameters associated with the base flood is highlyuncertain for alluvial fans.Further research is needed to provide better understanding of the factorsthat affect alluvial fan flooding, including: The hydrology of the watershedsabove and below the apex; the effects of alluvial fan geometric characteristics,sediment source and quantity; the effect of sediment on channel avulsion;the stability of flood channels on alluvial fans; the location and extendof the distinct hydraulic zones on the fan; and the determination of thestability of existing man-made structures during major flood events; andthe effects of those structures on the natural alluvial fan boundaries.In addition, the state of the art for the design and construction of otherthan major structural projects (i.e., whole fan protection projects) isnot well developed. The efficacy of more localized projects in providingprotection from fan hazards is not well known or readily assessed. Furtherresearch is also needed to investigate construction techniques and to assessdesign parameters for the construction of flood mitigation structures onfans. Unfortunately, the needed research will take time to complete.Given the present interest in development of alluvial fans and in anticipationof an increasing demand for Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) changes forareas on alluvial fans, FEMA has identified the need to develop a policyfor issuing map revisions for SFHAs on alluvial fans. FEMA believes thatit is prudent to take a conservative stand concerning the removal of theSFHA designation, and its associated lender notification and mandatoryinsurance purchase requirements, from alluvial fans. FEMA will, therefore,consider as a basis for map revisions involving alluvial fans only majorstructural flood mitigation measures that are supported by appropriateengineering analyses.Such measures should be designed to mitigate all hazards associated withalluvial fan flooding which include inundation, ground erosion, scour aroundstructures, and debris and sediment flow and accumulation, in additionto aggradation and degradation of the conveyance systems. In addition,the short and long-range effects of such measures on adjacent propertiesmust be considered. Major mitigation structures may include, but are notrestricted to, diversion dikes, flood walls, detention basins, and diversionchannels with inlet and outlet systems.Several communities special construction standards and zoning regulationsfor flood mitigation in developments on alluvial fans. While such approachesare encouraged, their efficacy in the control of flood waters on alluvialfans is uncertain. Therefore, FEMA will generally not recognize such approachesby themselves as an adequate basis for map revision.Because of the complexities associated with the many variables affectingflooding on alluvial fans and the lack of information with which to qualifythe major fan hazards and provide the appropriate construction techniquesfor structures on alluvial fans, the creation of an overall developmentmaster plan of flood control, drainage maintenance and floodplain managementis encouraged by FEMA. Such plans allow for strategic management of alluvialfans at the early stages of development. At this stage, the community isafforded a number of alternatives for dedicating specific portions of thefan to both structural and non-structural measures that will address theunique hazards associated with alluvial fan flooding.The proposed rule adds definitions for ``Alluvial Fan'' and ``Apex''. Additionally,the proposed rule amends Part 65 to add a new section to establish thepolicy, principles, and data requirements for flood plain mitigation measureson alluvial fans and the requirements for mapping and revising alluvialfan SFHAs.FEMA has determined, based upon an Environmental Assessment, that the proposedrule does not have significant impact upon the quality of the human environment.As a result, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared. Afinding of no significant impact is included in the formal docket fileand is available for public inspection and copying at the Rules DocketClerk, Office of General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency,500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472.The proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and has not undergone regulatory flexibility analysis.The proposed rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined in Executive Order12291, dated February 17, 1981, and hence, no regulatory analysis has beenprepared.FEMA has determined that this proposed rule does not contain a collectionof informaiton requirement as described in section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 44 CFR Parts 59, 60 and 65</ITAG>Flood insurance, Flood plains.Accordingly, it is proposed to amend CFR Chapter I, Subchapter B as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 59_GENERAL PROVISIONS</ITAG>1.

This information must be supplied to FEMA by the communityor other party seeking recognition of such a flood control measure at thetime a flood risk study or restudy is conducted, when a map revision underthe provisions of Part 65 of this subchapter is sought, and upon requestby the Administrator during the review of previously recognized flood controlmeasures. The FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of establishingappropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and shall not constitutea determination by FEMA as to how the flood control measure or system willperform in a flood event.(a) The applicable provisions of andSection;andSection; 65.2, 65.3, 65.4, 65.6,and 65.8 shall also apply to FIRM revisions involving alluvial fans.(b) The provisions of andSection; 65.5 regarding map revisions based on fillor other topographic alterations and the provisions of Part 70 regardinginadvertent inclusion of properties within a SFHA shall not apply to FIRMrevisions involving alluvial fans. In general, topographic alterationsalone, by fill or other means, will not serve as a basis for removing SFHAdesignations from alluvial fans.(c) FEMA will consider for map revision purposes major flood control measureswhose design and construction are supported by sound engineering analyseswhich demonstrate that the measures will effectively eliminate all alluvialfan flood hazard from the area protected by such measures. The providedanalyses must include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:(1) Engineering analyses that quantify the design discharges and volumesof water flow, debris flow, and sediment movement associated with the floodthat has a one-percent probability of being equaled or exceeded in anyyear at the apex of the fan under current watershed conditions and underpotential adverse conditions (e.g., deforestation of the watershed by fire).The potential for debris flow and sediment movement must be assessed usingan engineering method acceptable to FEMA. The assessment should considerthe characteristics and availability of sediment in the drainage basinabove the apex and on the alluvial fan.(2) Engineering analyses showing that the project elements will accommodatethe estimated peak discharge and volumes of water, debris, and sediment,as determined in accordance with (c)(1) of this section, and their associatedhydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces.(3) Engineering analyses showing that the project elements have been designedagainst the erosion and scour forces present.(4) Engineering analyses or evidence showing that the project elementswill provide protection form potential lateral migration and sudden relocationof flows from other parts of the fan.(5) Engineering analysis that assesses the methods of disposal of concentratedflood water and associated sediment load on adjacent properties.(6) Engineering analyses demonstrating that flooding from local runoff,or sources other than the fan apex, is insignificant or has otherwise beenaccommodated by the appropriate flood control or drainage measures.(d) Coordination. FEMA will recognize projects that are adequately designedand constructed provided that:(1) Evidence is submitted to show that the impact of the project on floodhazards in all areas of the fan, (including those not protected by theproject) and the design and maintenance requirements of the different elementsof the project were reviewed and approved by the community, State or localagency that has jurisdiction over flood control activities in the community.(2) The community provides assurance to FEMA that appropriate easementshave been secured from owners of property on which flood waters have beendirected.(e) Operation and Maintenance Plans and Criteria. The requirements foroperation and maintenance of flood control measures on alluvial fans shallbe those specified under andSection; 65,10 (c) and (d) when applicable.(f) Certification Requirements. Data submitted to support that a givenflood mitigation measure complies with the requirements set forth in paragraphs(c) (1) through (6) of this section must be certified by a registered professionalengineer. Also, certified as-built plans of the flood mitigation measuresmust be submitted.
