AGUILAR</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Banks will reopen for nearly normaloperations next Monday after being closed for two months because ofPanama's economic and political crisis, the president of theBankers' Association announced.   Earlier Tuesday, the Roman Catholic Church said it will notmediate the crisis until the civilian government that does Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega's bidding has ``a change of attitude.''   Edgardo Lasso, the Bankers' Association president, said in atelevision interview Tuesday that to avoid a run on the banks, theamount of cash depositors can withdraw will be restricted.   ``We are trying to reactivate the economy of the country,''Lasso said.   ``We will take care of the public in all banking activities''within the restrictions set by the government's Banking Commissionlate in March, he said.   Conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25percent of checking account balances as of March 3, the day thegovernment ordered banks closed. It sets a maximum of $10,000, withthe rest frozen for 90 days.   Withdrawals of up to $50 may be made from savings accounts onemonth after banks reopen.   Payment of interest is restricted and subject to cashavailability in each bank.   The commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the banks. OnApril 18, it let them begin accepting deposits. Because of limitson withdrawals, however, about 75 percent of the checks depositedbounced, analysts and business people said.   A week later, about a dozen additional services were resumed,including handling letters of credit; collecting outstanding loans;transferring funds within Panama, and making foreign exchangetransfers. But business people said the operations were largely onpaper and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidityand credit.   The association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating here,most of them foreign.   Both the March 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67banks holding licenses to conduct both local and internationalbanking business.   Others also closed their doors because of the impact of thecrisis.   Some closed as early as late February, after Noriega oustedPresident Eric Arturo Delvalle following the president's attempttried to fire the military strongman.   The political instability, U.S. economic sanctions and the lackof banking facilities brought Panama's economy to a near-standstill.   The Banking Commission had urged the banks to reopen with somerestrictions intended to ``maintain the cash position of the banksand protect depositors.''   The church agreed at the end of March to mediate talks betweenthe government and Noriega's opponents. It suspended the effort aweek later.   In a statement issued Tuesday, the church accused the governmentand official news media of ``personal and institutional attacks''on it and Archbishop Marcos Gregorio McGrath.   ``Since the attacks have proliferated in government news media,we assume the government rejects the mediation of the church,'' itsaid.   Monsignor Jose Maria Carrizo Villarreal, vice president of thePanamanian Conference of Bishops, signed the statement.   The bishops had offered to seek an ``honorable way out for Gen.Noriega as commander of the Defense Forces.'' The oppositiondemands Noriega leave as a condition for further talks, but thegovernment said it would not accept conditions for negotiating.   In Washington, Guillermo Cochez, a spokesman for Panama'sopposition Christian Democratic Party, said Noriega is consideringstepping down on Aug. 12, which Cochez said is Noriega's fifthanniversary as defense chief.   Noriega is under federal indictment in the United States on drugtrafficking charges, which he denies. In its attempt to remove him,the Reagan administration imposed sanctions that include blockingPanamanian assets in the United States and prohibiting U.S.payments to Panama.   The church has held the government responsible for the crisis,but also blamed the ``economic domination of foreign powers and ... the corruption in the public and private sectors.''   Leaders of the opposition said Tuesday they had held their firstmeeting aimed at establishing common objectives.   Alfredo Ramirez, president of the Liberal Republican Movement,said the objectives include ``democratization of the country andthe search for a solution to the economic and political crisis.''   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as Panama's chiefexecutive.</TEXT></DOC>
