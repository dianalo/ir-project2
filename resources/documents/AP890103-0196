Here's a report from an AP reporter who traveled theThai-Cambodian border, interviewing government officials andfugitives from refugee camps run by the Khmer Rouge.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By PETER ENG</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SITE B, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>  Khmer Rouge communist guerrillas areholding tens of thousands of Cambodian refugees virtual prisoners incamps in Thailand to serve a war machine bent on reseizing Cambodia,international aid officials say.   Some refugees have escaped to tell the story, people like MomSokhon, a teen-age girl.   Mom Sokhon survived four years under a Khmer Rouge regime thatslaughtered six of her relatives and hundreds of thousands of otherpeople in Cambodia. After invading Vietnamese forces ousted theregime, she headed to refugee camps in Thailand seeking haven fromthe war.   But Mom Sokhon wound up in the Khmer Rouge-controlled camp ofHuay Chan, and there, she said, the horror began again.   The guerrillas forced the 15-year-old girl to toil all day makingpunji, bamboo spears for impaling enemy soldiers. Hauling punishingloads of punji, rice and B-67 anti-tank rounds, she had to makeregular treks through heavily mined mountain passes from the camp toguerrilla bases inside Cambodia.   Often on the journey, at times a month long, two or three womenhad their legs blown off by mines or were shot dead in firefightswith the Vietnamese, she says.   ``If anyone refused to join the transport team, she would bepunished with no food and sent to an underground prison,'' she says.   After five years at Huay Chan, Mom Sokhon fled in November tothis refugee camp in eastern Surin province controlled by thenon-communist guerrillas of Prince Nodorom Sihanouk. She fears theKhmer Rouge will hunt her down.   Other Cambodian guerrilla groups and Thai security personnel alsohave frequently abused refugees in the camps along the Cambodianfrontier, but the Khmer Rouge is different.   A senior official experienced with rebel movements in Africa andthe Middle East says that even in the ruthless world of guerrillawarfare ``it's an unusual feature'' to use children as militaryporters.   ``The disregard for the sick and the disabled is extreme,'' hesays. ``There's a kind of totalitarianism I don't see elsewhere.''   Aid officials say hundreds, perhaps thousands, of refugees havedied of malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases because the KhmerRouge refused to treat them properly or would not allow them to seeforeign doctors because they would be ``polluted'' by them.   Another official, also speaking anonymously, said the peoplebeing held in the Khmer Rouge camps ``hardly smile at you, nevergreet you. They are afraid. In the other camps, the children run upand talk to you. This never happens in a Khmer Rouge camp. I thinkthey are systematically educating the parents to tell the childrennot to talk to foreigners.''   Concern over Khmer Rouge abuses has sharpened with theguerrillas' recent relocation of thousands of refugees out of twoUnited Nations-assisted camps.   Some 7,000 refugees were moved from Ta Luan camp to a border areawhere they came under heavy shelling in November. Many refugees werebelieved hurt but the guerrillas have refused to allow aid officialsaccess to them.   The Khmer Rouge has denied all charges of abuse. Or Hy, anadministrator at its showcase camp of Site B, said the people weremoving and portering voluntarily and added that ``all Khmer(Cambodians) should fight back the Vietnamese.''   When the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in 1975-78, they attempted tocreate a new agrarian society with purges, torture, and massrelocations of people from the cities to rural slave labor camps. Itdestroyed religion, culture and history to bring Cambodia back to``year zero'' and held the people under the fearful grip of``angka'' _ the organization.   Vietnam's invasion in late 1978 drove the Chinese-armed KhmerRouge to the Thai-Cambodian border, where it set up base camps. Tensof thousands of civilians under Khmer Rouge control were driven intoThailand by the devastating Vietnamese offensive of 1985.   In the few camps where aid workers have access, the Khmer Rougeseems to have abandoned the mass killings. But it maintains itsmilitaristic and xenphobic control over virtually every aspect ofpeople's lives. Marriage must be approved by camp authorities.Religious practice is banned. Most men wear Chinese militaryuniforms. In some camps, people cannot walk outside their ownsection.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
