The biotechnology company said it is producing a genetically engineered version of the substance, an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, and supplying it to NIH researchers under the collaboration agreement. The company added that it will have the right of first negotiation for anti-AIDS products developed from the work.    Reverse transcriptase's functions aren't well understood, but researchers studying the enzyme hope to develop anti-AIDS drugs that will block its action without harming other cellular enzymes. Such drugs might have fewer adverse side effects than anti-AIDS drugs such as AZT, which harm normal cellular processes, Genetics Institute said. </TEXT></DOC>
