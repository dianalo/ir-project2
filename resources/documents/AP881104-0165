Democratic Rep. Thomas Luken, a persistent critic of the Fernaldplant, said putting it on the cleanup list may be the only way topressure its owner, the U.S. Department of Energy, into cleaning upradioactive contamination at the plant's 1,050-acre site in Fernald,18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.   The plant, formally known as the Feed Materials ProductionCenter, processes uranium for the government's production of nuclearweapons, which are produced elsewhere.   Nearly 13 million pounds of uranium-containing waste have beendumped into the environment since the plant opened in 1951,according to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The DOE hasadmitted the dumping and says it plans to clean up the area.   ``To make Fernald a Superfund site may be the only way we can getthe ball rolling on cleaning up the Fernald site,'' Luken said.   The request will be directed to EPA Administrator Lee Thomas.   In Washington, Energy Department spokeswoman Gail Bradshaw saidher department was unaware of Luken's request. She said other EnergyDepartment sites have already been added to the Superfund list.   ``I don't think we'd have any comment other than it is our intentto bring them all into compliance,'' Ms. Bradshaw said of Luken'sproposal.   Residents near the Fernald plant and the state of Ohio haveseparate lawsuits pending, alleging that the plant has polluted itsenvironment with radioactive materials and created a public healththreat.</TEXT></DOC>
