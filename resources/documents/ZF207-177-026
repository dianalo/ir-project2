This is the 19th self-assessmentprocedure.andP;  All the previous ones are listed on the facing page.andP;  The first13 are available from ACM in a single loose-leaf binder to which laterprocedures may be added.andM;This procedure is intended to allow computer professionals to test theirknowledge of current U.S.andP;  copyright law as it applies to computer programs.andO;It has to do with copyrighting, what can and cannot be copyrighted,infringement, what is and is not protected, what rights are granted,penalties, &quot;fair use,&quot; and &quot;work made for hire.&quot;andP;  The questions should be ofinterest to practicing computer professionals and to university computingsciences students.andP;  In all except one case it is intended that there be onlyone correct answer for each of the multiple-choice questions.andM;The next few paragraphs repeat the introduction and instructions given withearlier procedures.andP;  Those who read them before may advance directly to thequestions.andM;What is Self-Assessment?andM;Self-assessment is based on the idea that a procedure can be devised thatwill help a person appraise and develop his or her knowledge about aparticular topic.andP;  It is intended to be an educational experience for aparticipant.andP;  The questions are only the beginning of the procedure.andP;  Theyare developed to help the participant think about the concepts and decidewhether to pursue the matter further.andM;The primary motivation of self-assessment is not for an individual to satisfyothers about his or her knowledge; rather it is for a participant to appraiseand develop his or her own knowledge.andP;  This means that there are several waysto use a self-assessment procedure.andP;  Some people will start with thequestions.andP;  Others will read the answers and refer to the references first.andO;These approaches and others devised by the participants are all acceptable ifat the end of the procedure the participant can say, &quot;Yes, this has been aworthwhile experience&quot; or &quot;I have learned something.&quot;andM;How to Use the Self-Assessment ProcedureandM;We suggest the following way of using the procedure, but as noted earlier,there are others.andP;  This is not a timed exercise; therefore, plan to work withthe procedure when you have an hour to spare, or you will be shortchangingyourself on this educational experience.andP;  Go through the questions, and markthe responses you think are most appropriate.andP;  Compare your responses withthose suggested by the Committee.andP;  In those cases where you differ with theCommittee, look up the references if the subject seems pertinent to you.andP;  Inthose cases in which you agree with the Committee, but feel uncomfortablewith the subject matter, and the subject is significant to you, look up thereferences.andM;Some ACM chapters may want to devote a session to discussing thisself-assessment procedure or the concepts involved.andM;The Committee hopes some participants will send comments.andM;This self-assessment procedure is not sanctioned as a test or endorsed in anyway by ACM.andP;  Any person using any of the questions in this procedure for thetesting or certification of anyone other than him- or herself is violatingthe spirit of this self-assessment procedure and the copyright on thismaterial.andM;This self-assessment procedure deals with the current state of federalcopyright law as applied to computer programs.andP;  The Constitution givesCongress the right to grant copyrights, that is, &quot;To promote the Progress ofScience and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors .andP;  .  . andO;the exclusive Right to their respective Writings.andP;  .  .  .&quot;  Congress, inturn, has established the statutory copyright law, the most recent versionbeing the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended in 1980, and codified at 17U.S.C.andP;  101 et seq.andP;  This is the basis of all U.S.andP;  copyright law.andM;Statutory law, despite appearances to the contrary, is actually a thing ofamazing brevity.andP;  Courts must interpret statutory law so that it will fiteach new and unique set of facts; the length and complexity of theseinterpretations tend to be directly proportional to the difficulty of thesubject matter.andM;The federal courts, which interpret copyright law, do not find the languageof computers to be simple.andP;  These courts, using the principle of staredecisis (legal Latin for &quot;following set precedent&quot;), attempt to decide eachindividual case in a predictable way, consistent with the decisions ofearlier cases.andP;  The statute, together with those consistent interpretations,give some stability to copyright law.andM;At this point a caveat is in order.andP;  The federal courts are arranged in ahierarchy; the Supreme Court is at the top of the hierarchy, the elevencircuit courts are in the center, and the district courts are at the bottom.andO;Any court must follow only its own precedent and that set by higher courts onits own tree.andP;  But, for example, a Florida district court which sits in theeleventh circuit, is not bound by a decision of the ninth circuit although itmay give that decision considerable weight.andP;  Thus, two or more approaches toa given legal issue may exist at the same time, depending on thejurisdiction.andP;  This situation may last indefinitely, until a court reversesitself, or until a higher court resolves the issue.andP;  If two or more circuitsdisagree there may never be resolution, since the Supreme Court will onlygrant certiorari (hear the case) if it decides the issue is sufficientlyimportant.andP;  (As yet, the Supreme Court has settled none of the copyrightissues involving software.)andM;It is also important to note that, although stated principles of law must, intheory, be followed, there are still two ways in which a court may come upwith a result that appears to differ from the precedent.andM;The first, and most common method, is for a court to distinguish the currentcase based on its different facts.andP;  Unless the essential facts of the twocases match exactly, there may be room for arguing that the reasoning used inthe earlier case does not properly apply to the current one; thus the earliercase is not a proper precedent.andP;  The second method, in which a decision makesentirely new law, or reverses old law, occurs less frequently, but is alsoimportant.andM;These methods impinge on the legal procedure in two ways.andP;  The first is thatfor a few of the questions, the answers may vary from jurisdiction tojurisdiction; the second is that a correct answer today may no longer be acorrect answer tomorrow when a new case is decided.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
