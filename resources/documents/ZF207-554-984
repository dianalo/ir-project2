Mark Weiser asks.andP;  The computerscience wizard, who is also lab manager at the Xerox Palo Alto ResearchCenter, pauses and takes a deep breath.andP;  &quot;OK.andP;  Let's do it!&quot; Within seconds,the futurist is raving about the need for &quot;ubiquitous computing,&quot; where&quot;scrap computers are as common and cheap as pieces of scrap paper.&quot; Computersso ingrained in our lifestyle that using them is as natural as putting onclothes.andP;  Computers that let you glide into a familiar user interface, so youget that &quot;feeling of home&quot; wherever you go.andP;  Computers that whisper datasecrets to one another invisibly.andP;  The Weiser world of computing is the stuffthat only sci-fi movies are made of, but he's being paid to dream big dreams.andO;He's from Xerox PARC, the think tank that invented the desktop computer, theportable computer, and the graphical user interface.andM;Go to Xerox PARC, the IBM labs, Hewlett-Packard Labs, Bellcore laboratories,or ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories, and you'll find eye-opening prototypes thatsuggest vasttechnological advances for the 1990s, when you'll be able to:andM;Send and receive video messages, voice-annotated illustrations, and documentson your PC.andP;  At Bellcore, in Morristown, New jersey, researchers havecombined these elements in a project called the Integrated Media ApplicationsLaboratory, which allows them to see and chat with each other through oneonscreen window as they dicker over a drawing exhibited in another.andM;Train your computer to preselect reading materials.andP;  At the IBM ScientificCenter, in Los Angeles, scientists incorporate natural-language processingtechniques into a software program trained to select and present newsaccounts according to a profile of the user's interests.andM;Initiate a heart-to-heart talk between a Unix and an OS/2 machine, withoutany protocol translation tools or funny black boxes.andP;  Weiser's team at XeroxPARC has developed a &quot;super operating system&quot; that overlays Unix, the NeXToperating system, and, soon, OS/2.andP;  With this system, known as PortableCommon Runtime (PCR), you can also swap data among applications written invarious programming languages.andP;  &quot;This software is the grease that lets dataglide over anything,&quot; says Weiser.andM;Transmit a spreadsheet from your computer to the accounting-office PC withoutwires.andP;  The folks at Bell Labs are doing research on a high-speed microwavelocal area network that filters out the echoes and distortions associatedwith microwave technology.andM;The Ones That Got AwayandM;Of course, it's one thing for the research arms of manufacturing firms todream of a future.andP;  It's another thing for the production and marketing armsto turn those dreams into real products.andM;One former Xerox PARC Fellow, who quit the company in frustration earlierthis year after seeing management drop the ball time and again on innovativetechnologies, claims, &quot;They had absolutely no courage to attempt to sellproducts we proposed that would compete with the Japanese on the low end.&quot; Anexecutive at IBM's Thomas J.andP;  Watson Research Center echoes similarsentiments, charging that IBM once let so many outstanding achievements slipthrough its fingers&quot;it was downright sinful.&quot;andM;Once they got away, technologies born in American labs often flew overseas,where foreign companies turned them into viable products.andP;  Two examples: thefacsimile machine and the laser printer.andM;Until recently, many researchers could see their work come to fruition in theUnited States only by cutting their labs' apron strings.andP;  In the early 1980s,some 27 out of 30 Ph.D.s in the Xerox PARC lab left with the glittering toysthat spawned the PC industry.andP;  Among them were Alan Kay, now at Apple, whopioneered work on windowing environments, and Chuck Geschke and John Warnock,who cofounded Adobe Systems and developed the PostScript page descriptionlanguage.andM;A New BeginningandM;Shortly after the mass exodus from PARC, many labs initiated steps to ensurethat the process of developing new technologies into products could occurmore efficiently and that their top researchers wouldn't follow the sirensong of a venture capitalist.andM;They began by opening up new channels of communication between manufacturingand marketing officials and lab researchers.andP;  Ten years ago, it was &quot;no bigdeal for scientists to be so immersed in experiments that they had littleknowledge of the product line,&quot; comments a former IBM Watson Research Centermanager.andP;  Today, IBM scientists are urged to switch back and forth betweenthe laboratories and the business divisions to understand how customerdemands drive development.andM;According to lab scientists, the funds devoted to basic research haven't beencut back, despite the new importance labs place on developing products.andP;  Atmost labs, between 10 and 20 percent of the budget is devoted to basicresearch designed to look 5, 10, or even 20 years into the future without aspecific product goal in mind, while the remainder of the lab's resources aredevoted to applied research on technologies that will soon becomecommercially viable.andM;&quot;I find a lot of autonomy here,&quot; says Lucy Suchman, a basic researcher atXerox PARC who is studying man-machine interaction.andP;  &quot;I can define the scopeof my research project and take a lot of initiative.andP;  Basic research iscertainly valued.&quot;andM;In addition, budgets at the research labs have shown a healthy immunity tocutbacks in other corporate expenditures.andP;  Last year, for instance, even asthe Xerox Corporation lopped off its medical instrument division and reporteddismal earnings overall, it increased research and development spending for1989 and left lab management intact.andP;  Similarly, ATandamp;T reported a loss of $1.6billion, but the $2.6 billion budget at Bell Labs for 1989 remained stable.andM;&quot;It's very important to our people that the budget does not get jerkedaround,&quot; says David Lang, a Bell Labs manager.andP;  &quot;You need to provide a stableenvironment if you want good research done.&quot;andM;Toward that end, the labs surround their workers with creature comforts (awindow office is provided for every scientist at Xerox PARC) and try to keepthe stress level to a minimum (often no research deadlines are imposed at IBMor at Bell Labs).andP;  But the labs are not country clubs: &quot;Eighty-hour workweeksare nothing,&quot; says We're like a bunch of grown-up grad students.&quot;andM;The labs are also revamping their policies so that researchers can bepromoted to the management track faster than workers in other areas.andO;According to Ronan Campion, who is Bell Labs' technical business operationsdirector &quot;We recognize the 'stars' much more quickly these days because wewant to keep them happy.&quot;andM;IBM, meanwhile, hands out cash awards, ranging from $25,000 to $100,000, toindividual researchers and research teams who have demonstrated outstandingtechnical or creative achievement.andM;Finding the MarketandM;The labs also are placing a new emphasis on identifying projects that havestrong commercial potential.andP;  &quot;There is no recipe to picking the winners,&quot;reports Charles Larson of the Industrial Research Institute, in New YorkCity.andP;  &quot;A lot of it is simply gut feel and listening to customers.&quot;andM;&quot;For every ten research ideas, you might get to one prototype,&quot; notes labmanager Michael Lesk of Bellcore, the research arm of the telephonecompanies.andP;  &quot;For every ten prototypes, you have one product.andP;  For every tenproducts, you might have a successand that's great.&quot;andM;To ensure that potential successes are recognized, firms are building newcooperative relationships among management, product development forces,marketing arms, and labs.andP;  At Hewlett-Packard Labs, for example, every labproject manager has a counterpart in the development divisions.andM;Also speeding up the product cycle is a new approach to project management.andO;At Bell Labs before ATandamp;T's divestiture, a scientist would take a project tomarketing only after it was finished, and marketing in turn would disclosethe project to manufacturing only after approving it.andP;  Today, that philosophyno longer holds.andP;  &quot;We try to let everyone know what's going on early in theprocess,&quot; reports Arno Penzias, Nobel Prize winner and vice president ofresearch at Bell Labs&quot;No one can afford to work the old way anymore.andP;  Thecompany will clean your clock.&quot;andM;Reaping the RewardsandM;These new approaches have yielded some sterling successes.andP;  TheHewlett-Packard ink jet printer, for instance, is a classic example of thelab-to-development-to-marketplace process clicking on all cylinders.andO;Hewlett-Packard's scientists first devised the thermal heating method at theheart of their ink jet printers in 1979.andP;  The process shoots ink droplets ondemand, yielding a cleaner result tha&quot;continuous stream&quot; technology, in whichpressurized ink sprays out constantly.andP;  Thanks to a cooperative effortbetween HP's developers and researchers, strong backing from management, andan emphasis on both consumer appeal and manufacturing simplicity, themuch-acclaimed HP Thinkjet printer made its debut within five years-half theaverage gestation period of new technologies.andM;Other key successes in recent years include the StarLAN local area network,born at Bell Labs, which runs the Ethernet networking protocol over ordinaryphone lines; the sophisticated caching techniques and high-capacity harddisks developed at various IBM labs for the PS/2 Model 70; and newdocument-scanning techniques developed at Xerox PARC for the KurzweilDiscoverer 7320 scanner.andM;A Golden TomorrowandM;Is the research lab withering? Not on your life.andP;  Insiders and lab watchersbelieve the labs are being managed better than ever before-a view backed byincreases in the number of corporate patents secured in 1988 compared with1978 at Bell Labs, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard.andM;Scientists who have witnessed changes agree that top management is seriousabout moving technology off the lab table to dealer shelves.andP;  Says John SeelyBrown, vice president of advanced research at Xerox PARC: &quot;In the past, wewould throw technology over the fence to see if it would stick.andP;  That wastechnology transfer.andP;  Now, we are getting our ideas understood by thecompany.&quot;andM;So get ready for the future.andP;  A dream PC that fits in your pocket, beamsscreen images onto the walls, responds to your voice, and reads yourhandwriting may well be winging its way from a lab table to you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
