(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Potent Micros Empower DesktopsandM;Last year's hot micro was the 386SX, a 32-bit software-compatible, 16-bitmemory version of the 386.andM;This year's favorite is the 64-bit 486 microprocessor first meant for fileservers, yet rapidly making its way onto desktops because of its terrificspeed and falling price.andM;Old-timers will remember that this progression from file server tosingle-user computer has happened before.andP;  When IBM Corp. introduced the6-MHz, 286-based PC AT, it described the machine as a file server because thechip was regarded as too powerful for individual needs.andM;The same thing already has happened with 486 machines, although they havebeen available for less than a year.andP;  Chip designer Intel Corp. and computermanufacturers also called the 486 chip the basis for more powerful fileservers.andM;But the 486 that IBM first demonstrated and shipped was the Power Platform --a single-user system put together rapidly from the PS/2 Model 70 desktop.andM;The spread of 486s sustained a blow when Intel's early chip production maskturned out to have bugs in its exception-checking algorithm.andM;IBM, having jumped to the forefront by shipping the 486 Power Platform lastOctober, had to halt sales when the bug was found.andP;  Defective Power Platformswere replaced at no cost once new chips arrived from Intel.andM;The bugs were limited to error checking and the ability to execute tangentand sine or cosine functions simultaneously.andP;  Problems showed up most inAutoCAD and Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 operations.andM;Bug-Free ChipsandM;Tandon Corp. of Moorpark, Calif., could not reproduce the bug-inducedfailures and pronounced the original 486 a good chip.andP;  Other micromanufacturers also continued to sell while warning customers of the problemand promising free upgrades as chips became available.andM;Intel rushed to begin shipping a bug-free B-6 version of the 486 chip tocertain customers last November.andP;  Quantities were limited, so Intel alsooffered an interim B-5 chip that removed the bug through modifications of thealready designed motherboards.andM;This chip shortage pushed most 486 system ship dates into January 1990 orlater.andP;  Buyers also faced disappointment because the 486 came out first in a25-MHz version instead of the 33-MHz screamer that finally is beginning tomake its presence felt.andM;Prices of 486s have dropped quickly.andP;  Zeos International Ltd. of St. Paul,Minn., a vendor not on the CSA schedule, sells full 486 desktop systems withmonitors for less than $5,000.andP;  So do several other vendors.andM;The price of a 33-MHz 386 system with an 80387 coprocessor and a goodhardware cache is not all that different from the price of an inexpensive 486system similarly equipped.andP;  However, you probably will have to gooff-schedule to buy the 486 you want because so few are listed yet.andM;Is it worth the trouble?andP;  Consider this before you buy: The average 25-MHz486 system outperforms a 33-MHz 386 by only about 10 percent to 30 percent onmany tasks.andM;In performance benchmarks that test CPU-intensive operations or work the mathcoprocessor heavily, the 25-MHz 486 runs at 10 million instructions persecond and outperforms the 33-MHz 386 by a wide margin -- about twice thespeed.andM;But for applications like desktop publishing, an inexpensive 486 with slowhard drive and slow video performance will be significantly less productivethan a 386 with a caching hard drive controller and fast VGA or 8514 videocontroller.andM;The 486 basically is a modified 386 with a 64-bit internal bus, built-incache and builting coprocessor.andP;  It runs all the software that runs onearlier Intel microprocessors from the 8086 up through the 33-MHz 386,although some BIOS differences on mother-boards may require special versionsof Unix or OS/2.andM;Certain 32-bit programs run only on 386 and 486 systems.andP;  But nearly allapplications software for PC- or AT-compatible machines will run on the newer32-bit machines, though in some cases at reduced clock speed.andM;The 486 undeniably is fast and can be speeded up even more by careful systemdesign.andP;  For example, many vendors add hardware cache memory.andM;Bus ArchitecturesandM;One other issue for today's 486 buyer is making a choice between busarchitectures.andP;  Compaq Computer Corp. wants you to take this choiceseriously; other manufacturers make nearly identical computers with eitherthe Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) or Micro ChannelArchitecture (MCA).andP;  You may be able to order a different bus just by addingthe letter E to the model name.andM;What does EISA vs.andP;  MCA signify to buyers?andM;IBM introduced the Micro Channel Architecture, or MCA, in 1987 to takeadvantage of the new 32-bit 386 microprocessor.andP;  Years later, the fight overMCA's primacy still rages.andM;Compaq, leading the so-called Pack of Nine manufacturers, set the battlelines in 1988 with a proposed extension of the PC/AT bus or Industry StandardArchitecture (ISA).andP;  The new bus, christened EISA, was supposed to be betterthan MCA because it could accept the old-style ISA expansion cards.andM;Now three kinds of 486 systems are available: ISA-bus computers with special32-bit memory expansion boards or plenty of motherboard memory, Micro Channelsystems and EISA systems.andM;Test matches have been rather unenlightening.andP;  Many questions will remainunanswered until the contending machines have been evaluated under heavy fileserver loads with bus master cards installed.andM;IBM, for instance, claims that MCA machines deliver faster burst-datatransfer speeds than EISA machines.andP;  I have yet to see this in actualbenchmark tests.andP;  On every test I was able to apply with readily availableaccessory boards, I found the two architectures about equal in throughput.andM;The biggest performance difference I found was between an MCA-based AdvancedLogic Research Inc.andP;  PowerCache4 matched against a Zeos EISA machine -- both25-MHz models with 8M RAM and large, fast hard drives.andP;  The difference camefrom the hard-disk cache and had nothing to do with the bus configuration orthe processors' external cache.andM;Both these machines, as well as an IBM Model 70/486 with a slower hard drive,turned in stunning performance with math-intensive programs such as SymbolicsInc.'s Macsyma symbolic mathematics program.andM;Many older benchmark programs are not useful in testing 486 systems becausethey run too quickly to differentiate the machines.andP;  My own benchmarkssimulate real-world tasks in Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3.0.andM;One of my two benchmarks runs a simple macro that expands the spreadsheet bywriting &quot;Government Computer News&quot; 5,000 times.andP;  The other performs acounting loop 50,000 times.andP;  I carry out both tests with a stopwatch toeliminate reliance on the internal clock.andM;On many tests, the MCA-bus ALR machine with its special processor cachedesign is the fastest of the three by about 10 percent.andP;  This cannot be dueto the bus because the IBM Model 70 definitely is slower than the other twoon all operations.andM;Surprisingly, although the three 25-MHz systems completed both benchmarks inabout two minutes, my old IBM Model 80 16-MHz 386 with no coprocessorfinished the loop calculation in just under seven minutes and the text macroin just over 10 minutes.andP;  It was much faster in relation to the 486s than Ihad expected.andM;Disk ControllerandM;For other tasks requiring hard-disk access, the Zeos handily beat the othertwo 486s because of its caching hard-disk controller.andP;  The disk controlleroption can be ordered on most systems, although not on the IBM Model 70.andM;On graphics-intensive tests, graphics cards made a far bigger difference thaneither processor type or clock speed.andM;The obvious conclusion from these early tests of 486 systems is that unlessyou have specific requirements only one model can meet, such asmultiprocessor capability or very large memory, you can buy 486s pretty muchas a commodity, just like 386 systems.andM;If you need exceptional performance, consider a Weitek coprocessor option, acaching-disk controller or a larger hardware cache for the microprocessor.andO;However, you can confidently buy almost any quality 486 if all you need is aboost over 386 performance on a variety of applications.andM;For jobs like desktop publishing, you will getbetter performance by adding ahigh-performance video card to an older 386 than by purchasing a 486 withoutenhanced video performance.andM;One plus for MCA machines, other than the promised future high bus-transferrates when adapter cards arrive, is to make it easier to add new boards orotherwise change system configuration.andM;Most of the help calls placed to makers of accessory cards result from setupproblems.andP;  Although you may run into an occasional problem with MCA cards,they eliminate jumper and address-setting problems by individually assigningAdapter Description File codes.andM;EISA systems also have automatic expansion card setup, but only for the32-bit EISA slot.andP;  EISA's main virtue is that it accepts the older 8-and16-bit boards from PC and AT machines -- or at least those that operate atthe higher 16-bit EISA bus speed.andP;  This is faster than on the original PC butslower than the EISA 32-bit bus speed.andM;From the very introduction of the EISA architecture, many users, includingmyself, have questioned whether this claimed advantage of compatibility witholder boards really matters.andP;  Do people ever purchase a new machine and putold boards in it?andP;  Did EISA proponents think there were vast stockpiles ofISA boards lying around waiting for faster machines?andM;When the first Micro Channel systems appeared, few MCA-compatible expansionboards were on the market, but plenty of ISA boards were.andM;By the time EISA machines finally came to market, MCA boards were availablefor MCA machines.andM;Board to TearsandM;So it goes in the bus wars.andP;  Whether you buy MCA or EISA, you probably canfind the accessory board you want.andM;Some buyers feel confused about whether MCA-compatible and PS/2-compatiblemean the same thing.andP;  Here is a quick explanation.andM;IBM's PS/2s were the first micros with the IBM Micro Channel Architecture,but they had far more: floppy drive controllers, VGA graphics, mouse ports,serial and parallel ports.andP;  All of it was built into the motherboards, orplanar boards as IBM labeled them.andM;These days, any computer claiming PS/2 compatibility must have a 3 1/2-inchfloppy drive, VGA graphics and other capabilities built in.andP;  But computersare defined as MCA-compatible if they merely have the Micro ChannelArchitecture.andM;Actually, this is not much of a problem because nearly all MCA computers havethe ports and VGA.andP;  Some offer even higher color graphics performance at lowextra cost, because they put VGA on an accessory board instead of on themotherboard as IBM does.andM;The only other thing to watch for is the fact that some PS/2s are notMCA-bus.andP;  But that does not apply to the 386- or 486-based PS/2s.andP;  Until newaccessory boards arrive that really exploit the higher burst speeds on neverMCA machines, there really is little difference between the two competingarchitectures.andM;However, a point worth considering is that IBM created both the PC and AT(ISA) bus standards.andP;  It seems reasonable that, with IBM's head start and nocompelling reason to buy EISA, IBM architectures are a pretty good bet.andM;In general, however, you should configure your system according to the majorpresent application.andM;If you have a limited budget and do desktop publishing, buy a 386SX computerwith large hard drive, caching hard-disk controller, fast graphics card andlots of memory, rather than a less well-equipped 486.andM;But for heavy-duty number crunching, look to a 486 system.andP;  It costs aboutthe same as a 386 if you have no special graphics or hard-drive needs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
