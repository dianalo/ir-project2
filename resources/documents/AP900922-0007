The comment was the latest in a series of remarks by Japanesegovernment officials that have offended American minority groups. AWashington-based civil rights group called the comment by JusticeMinister Seiroku Kaqjiyama racist.   ``It's a reprehensible and racist statement,'' said Ralph Neas,executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.   Kajiyama made the commen at a news conference Friday afterobserving a nighttime raid on the Shinjuku district of Tokyo, anotorious red-light district.   ``It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed becauseblacks move in, and whites are forced out,'' Kajiyama said afterwatching police and immigration authorities arrest foreign womenfor alleged prostitution.   Prostitutes ``ruin the atmosphere'' of neighborhoods in the sameway, the 64-year-old minister said. A Justice Ministry spokesmanconfirmed the comments Saturday after they appeared in Japanesenews reports.   Shortly after the news conference, the ministry issued astatement quoting Kajiyama as saying he meant to convey that peopleliving in the Shinjuku area feel insecure and have beencomplaining.   ``I intended to say that we must take measures to solve thisproblem. I did not mean to talk about racial issues,'' Kajiyamasaid in the statement.   It said the minister's comments contained ``expressions that maycause misunderstanding,'' but the statement did not contain anexplicit apology.   In observing the police raid, Kajiyama was carrying out one ofhis first official duties as justice minister. He was appointedlast week to replace Shin Hasegawa, who resigned because ofillness.   Minority groups in the United States have criticized Japan inrecent years for similar statements made by Japanese politicians,as well as advertising images and allegedly discriminatory hiringpractices by U.S.-based Japanese companies.   Sensitivity to racial issues ``is a new ballgame for old(Japanese) politicians, and they still don't know how to play it,''said Patricia Steinhoff, a University of Hawaii sociologist doingresearch in Japan.   ``There is a very high acceptance of discrimination in Japan,''she said. ``They don't realize this is out of bounds'' elsewhere.   The discriminatory comments have sometimes arisen whenpoliticians and other Japanese praised the ``homogeneity'' ofJapan's population.   American minority groups protested vigorously in 1986, whenthen-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said, ``On the average, theUnited States is lower because of a considerable number of blacks,Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.''   Nakasone said he was referring to literacy rate. He laterapologized and said he realized his comment had ``offended manyAmericans.'' But he did not retract his remarks.   In 1988, Michio Watanabe, policy chief for the governing LiberalDemocratic Party, said American blacks have few qualms about goingbankrupt and implied they walk away from their debts.   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and Watanabe later apologizedfor his remark.   But the furor ignited a debate in the U.S. Congress. TheCongressional Black Caucus accused three Japanese companies ofproducing products and mannequins which allegedly show blacks in astereotypical and degrading light. The products included wide-eyedblack dolls with red-lipped grins.   The latest controversy comes at a time when American attitudestoward Japan have soured because of trade tensions and the beliefthat Japan has been slow in providing support in the Persian Gulfcrisis, according to recent polls.   Despite a law outlawing prostitution in Japan, it is aflourishing underground industry.   The numbers of foreign prostitutes have increased along with aflood of workers entering or staying in Japan illegally to earnhighly valued yen. Mobsters are known to recruit foreignprostitutes and operate bars and brothels where they work.</TEXT></DOC>
