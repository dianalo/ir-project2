Not surprisingly, project management on PCs became thedomain of the project-management specialist.andM;Unfortunately, in order to get projects done on time and within budget, it isthe manager most familiar with the project who must use the tool.andP;  Aspecialist (assuming one's available) is of little use because he or she istoo far removed from the day-to-day decision making to really understand theproject.andM;This point is crucial.andP;  It is only the line manager, who has sufficientknowledge of the intricacies of the project and the conflicting requirementsfor key resources, who can optimally schedule projects.andP;  It is this manager,who every day is charged to do more with less, who most needs a tool that canautomatically trade deadlines and resources and recommend solutions.andM;But in their quest to provide more and powerful tools, project-managementsoftware developers have ignored the line manager.andP;  At the request ofproject-management specialists, developers have added more and more featuresto their products without significantly altering the complex, text-basedinterface.andP;  As a result, each addition has made the tools harder to use, andthe benefits of more power have been lost.andM;The new graphics-based operating systems, however, provide a naturalenvironment for project-management tools because they allow the user to planand modify a project as if by hand.andP;  Using a mouse, the user draws a pictureof the project, starting at the beginning and moving forward step by step tocompletion.andP;  Everything else is automatic.andM;An added benefit of the graphical interface is its WYSIWYG (what you see iswhat you get) nature; users can easily customize reports with different typesizes and styles to produce presentation-quality reports.andM;Until recently, the graphical mouse-driven interface popularized by the AppleMacintosh was the exception rather than the rule.andP;  Today, the reverse istrue: Microsoft Windows operating under DOS, IBM's Presentation Manageroperating under OS/2, Sun's Open Look, Hewlett-Packard's NewWave, and theMACH operating system used in Steve Jobs' NeXT machine all featuregraphics-based, point-and-click interfaces.andP;  In the near future almost allapplication software will be written to take advantage of the graphicalinterface.andM;The challenge that now faces project-management software developers is toforget about the old text-based interface and think creatively about howgraphics can be used.andP;  Meeting this challenge will be costly; developers mustscrap inappropriate text-based software and rewrite it from the bottom up.andO;But those who meet the challenge will be rewarded.andM;The graphical interface will bring project-management software its firstbest-selling product, spurring the acceptance of project management as anindispensible tool for the average manager, as widely understood and used asthe spreadsheet.andM;----------Timothy Breen is the CEO of San Francisco-based Micro Planning International,a project-management software developer and consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
