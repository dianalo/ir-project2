<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-0186 </DOCNO><TEXT>Creep tests of Ni-base heat resistant alloys (Hastelloy XR and XR-II)were conducted at 950deg C in four kinds of helium environments withdifferent impurity compositions in order to examine the effect of decarburizingenvironment. Both alloys were decarburized in a helium environment withlow partial pressure of oxygen and carbon activity. The decarburizationinduced degradation of creep properties such as lower creep rupture strength,higher creep rate and earlier start of accelerating creep. Whether thedecarburization of the Hastelloy XR and XR-II might occur or not in theprimary helium coolant of high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR)could be predicted by using a corrosion map of a stability diagram forchromium. Controlling impurities to maintain higher partial pressureof exygen and carbon activity in primary helium coolant of HTGR is proposedin order to prevent degradation of creep properties of the materialscaused by decarburization.</TEXT></DOC>
