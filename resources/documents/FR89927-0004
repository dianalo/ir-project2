The purpose of these requirements is to prevent the misrepresentationof imported Native American-style jewelry as genuine Native American Jewelry.The changes require that Native American-style jewelry be indelibly markedwith the country of origin by cutting, die-sinking, engraving, stamping,or some other equally permanent method, or with a similarly marked plasticor metal tag. Adhesive labels or string tags will be permitted only whenindelible marking is technically or commercially infeasible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This amendment is effective with respect to merchandiseentered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after October27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Lorrie Rodbart, Value, SpecialPrograms andamp; Admissibility Branch, U.S. Customs Service (202) 566-5765.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Section 304 of the Tariff Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304), generally requiresthat every article of foreign origin imported into the U.S. shall be markedin a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the natureof the article will permit in a manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaserin the United States the English name of the country of origin of the article.Part 134, Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 134), implements the countryof origin marking requirements and exceptions of 19 U.S.C. 1304.The Customs Service normally permits any reasonable method of marking thatwill remain on the article during handling until it reaches the ultimatepurchaser (19 CFR 134.41 and 134.44). This includes the use of paper stickerlabels and string tags. However, where it is shown that a particular methodof marking is not sufficiently permanent to inform the ultimate purchaserof the country of origin of the article, the Custom Service may requireanother type of marking which will insure that in all foreseeable circumstances,the article will reach the ultimate purchaser with its country of originmarking intact.An initial notice of proposed rulemaking requiring more strict methodsof marking for Native American-style jewelry was published by the CustomsService in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 15, 1986 (51 FR 25574). This was in responseto allegations by representatives of the Native American handicraft industrythat some jewelry and craft dealers and wholesalers remove country of originlabels from imported goods and sell them as authentic Native American products.While comments resulting from that notice were still being evaluated, thesame problem was addressed in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Actof 1988 enacted on August 23, 1988 (Pub. L. 100-418). Section 1907(c) ofthat act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe and implementwithin 1 year of enactment regulations which require indelible and permanentcountry of origin marking to the greatest extent possible on all importedNative American-style jewelry and arts and crafts.A second notice of proposed rulemaking more specifically addressed to thestatutory mandate was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 10, 1989 (54 FR 6418). That noticecontained a discussion of the comments received in response to our earliernotice, many of which favored extending the proposal to include eitherall jewelry or all silver jewelry, and noted that the requirements withrespect to Native American-style arts and crafts would be dealt with ina separate rulemaking procedure. Also, refer to that notice and the followinginformation for more details concerning the nature of our changed markingrequirements for Native American-style jewelry.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments </ITAG>Customs requested comments on three alternative approaches to implementationof the statutory requirement that all Native American-style jewelry bepermanently and indelibly marked with the country of origin: (1) Requireindelible marking on Native American-style jewelry only (this is the proposalon which comments were previously received and would include imported jewelrythat incorporates traditional Native American design motifs, materials,and/or construction); (2) require indelible marking on all silver and silveralloy jewelry and other jewelry that looks like Native American; and (3)require indelible marking on all jewelry without any reference to its relationshipto Native American-style.Although Customs proposed the third option, we indicated that the finaldecision would be based on the weight of the evidence. Comments were alsorequested concerning the additional costs that may be imposed on consumers,importers, and others affected directly by the proposed marking requirementsand ways in which the proportion of jewelry items subject to marking couldbe reduced while accomplishing the statutory objective of ensuring thepermanent marking of imported Native American-style jewelry.In response to the notice, 73 written comments were received. The largestgroup of commenters (46) favored the permanent marking of only Native American-stylejewelry, 26 commenters favored the permanent marking of all foreign-madejewelry, and two commenters favored indelible marking of silver and silveralloy jewelry.<ITAG tagnum="84">Commenters Favoring Indelible Marking of All Jewelry</ITAG>Some of the commenters who favor indelible marking of all jewelry statethat they do so because of the difficulty in separating Native American-stylejewelry from other jewelry styles. The Department of the Interior, IndianArts and Crafts Board, indicates that any definition of Native American-stylejewelry that is based on design characteristics, materials, or on a specificlist of products is doomed to failure because contemporary craftsmen necessarilydevelop new approaches to their art. Other commenters expressed similarconcerns. The option to require indelible marking on all jewelry purportedlyavoids the definition problem and also covers all jewelry that might bemisrepresented as Native American. The Indian Arts and Crafts Board isalso of the opinion that requiring indelible marking of all silver or silveralloy jewelry, does not go far enough since Native American craftsmen areincreasingly making use of gold, brass, and other materials and that, therefore,this approach does not satisfy the statutory mandate that indelible markingof Native American-style jewelry be required ``to the greatest extent possible.'' Although most commenters who favored indelible marking of all jewelry doso because of their concerns about imported Native American-style jewelry,a few commenters indicate that this approach is necessary to address problemsassociated with the marking of all styles of jewelry, including items thatare not Native American-style. One trade association of domestic jewelrymanufacturers and their suppliers cites a study undertaken by the CustomsService in 1986 which showed a 21 percent marking violation rate for importedjewelry. Because the study was based on cargo examination at ports of entry,the association contends that it did not reveal the equally significantproblems following entry of the jewelry when impermanent labels are removed.It claims that the indelible marking of all jewelry would eliminate theopportunity for deception, benefit the domestic industry and fully informthe consumer. One commenter supporting the proposal to require indeliblemarking on all jewelry states that tags will be removed before sale andnotes that there are available technologies to mark all jewelry indelibly.Some commenters indicated that this option should be adopted just becausethe public needs to know the country of origin.<ITAG tagnum="85">Commenters Favoring Indelible Marking of all Silver and Silver AlloyJewelry</ITAG>Two commenters favor this option because it would be a first step in protectionof Native American artists.<ITAG tagnum="85">Commenters Favoring Indelible Marking of Only Native American-StyleJewelry</ITAG>1. <T3>This approach is in accordance with congressional intent. </T3>Mostof the commenters favoring this approach are importers and retailers ofboth fine and costume jewelry. Some comments were also received from foreigngovernments and United States government agencies. The major reason citedby the commenters for limiting the regulation to Native American-stylejewelry, as opposed to all jewelry or all silver and silver alloy jewelry,is that this is in accordance with congressional intent, as expressed insection 1907(c) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Accordingto the commenters, the statutory language is clear and unambiguous withregard to the fact that the only type of imported jewelry that must beindelibly marked to indicate its country of origin is Native American-stylejewelry, and that any application of this provision to all imported jewelryis inconsistent with the statutory language.These commenters also indicate that requiring indelible marking on alljewelry would not further legislative intent because the bulk of importedjewelry cannot be mistaken for Native American jewelry. Several commentersindicated that only a minute segment of the imported jewelry could possiblybe mistaken for Native American jewelry.2. <T3>Indelible marking is more costly than presently used permissible methods.</T3>Most of the commenters opposed to indelible marking of all jewelryindicated that indelible marking of jewelry would be far more costly thanthe methods permitted now (<T3>i.e.,</T3> adhesive labels and hang tags), ultimately resulting inhigher resale prices. According to the commenters, the higher costs aredue primarily to the costs to obtain needed dies and in applying them andthe costs of permanently attaching metal or plastic tags to pieces whichwill not accommodate indelible marking themselves. One commenter indicatedthat fine jewelry generally cannot be marked by standard tooling and mustbe done by hand resulting in greater labor costs. One retailer estimatesthat additional piece marking would increase the cost between $.15 and$.50 per piece for fine gold jewelry requiring a link or tag. Accordingto some costume jewelry importers, the costs to indelibly mark these itemswould be prohibitive, noting that in some cases, the marking could costmore that the article itself. One commenter indicates that a single companycould require as many as 100 new molds.According to a cost-benefit analysis submitted by the Federal Trade Commission,indelible marking of all jewelry would result in increased costs to manufacturersand importers and little corresponding increased benefits for consumers.The FTC indicates that since the volume of jewelry imported into the UnitedStates is very large, the aggregate costs (of marking all jewelry) to themanufacturers, and ultimately to consumers, will be substantial even ifthe costs per price are modest. It is also noted that in some instancesthe act of stamping the items (if the alternative of affixing a metal orplastic tag permanently is not feasible) may damage the item, in whichcase its value would be reduced and the effective cost of stamping wouldbe increased. Finally, the FTC states that they have learned that at leastsome foreign manufacturers probably do not have the equipment that wouldbe needed to mark items permanently.3. <T3>Present methods of marking are adequate.</T3> Another argument of thosecommenters opposed to indelible marking of all jewelry is that the presentmethods of marking are adequate to inform the ultimate purchaser of thecountry of origin. They contend that the proposal to require indeliblemarking of all jewelry is overbroad and unnecessarily targets a generalclass of merchandise for special marking requirements without a requisiteshowing that the existing methods are inadequate. The commenters pointout that for many years jewelry has been marked by means of stickers andtags without complaints. In fact, they note that Customs has recognizedin rulings that a hang tag affixed to an article of jewelry may be a moreconspicuous and legible method of marking than small lettering on the articleitself. Therefore, it is argued that the proposed regulations may actuallybe less effective in informing the ultimate purchaser than the presentmethod of marking the country of origin.Many of these commenters also point out that there are sufficient safeguardsand remedies under existing laws regarding misrepresentation or the intentionalremoval of the country of origin marking. They indicate that any misrepresentationof the place of origin is an unfair trade practice in violation of 15 U.S.C.41 <T3>et seq.</T3> and that the intentional removal of the requisite countryof origin marking is a criminal offense under 19 U.S.C. 1304(h).4. <T3>Practical problems of broad option. </T3>Another criticism raised bymany commenters is that indelible marking would have an adverse effecton the aesthetic appearance of quality imported jewelry. It is feared thatconspicuous marking might be seen when the piece of jewelry is worn, especiallywhen the marking is affixed by means of a metal tag. Due to the aestheticnature of jewelry articles, it is argued that marking by means of a removablehang tag, label or sticker is more practical than indelible marking.Many commenters also indicated that most pieces cannot accommodate indeliblemarking. One large importer and retailer of costume jewelry indicates thatthe majority of pieces have no surfaces large enough to permit countryof origin marking and that much jewelry cannot accommodate indelible markingfor other reasons, <T3>e.g., </T3>it is hollow or the piece is too delicate. Importers andretailers of fine jewelry inform us that the stamping of delicate and hollowitems would damage the jewelry, and that the items are already marked witha trademark and quality markings so there is little room, if any, to markthe country of origin on a clasp or bezel. In addition, we are told byimporters of costume jewelry that many of the materials used, such as bone,onyx and glass, do not lend themselves to permanent marking, regardlessof the surface size.Several commenters indicate that permanent tags will interfere with theaesthetic display and prevent customers from trying jewelry on before purchase.The tags will allegedly detract from the appearance of the jewelry andput it at competitive disadvantage to jewelry that is not so marked.Another practical problem associated with the use of metal tags concernsweighing of jewelry. Several commenters indicated that a piece could notbe properly weighed with a tag attached.5. <T3>Requiring indelible marking on all imported jewelry would increasetrade friction. </T3>Finally, several commenters, including the U.S. TradeRepresentative, the Delegation of the Commission of the European Communities,and some foreign governments indicate that requiring indelible markingon all jewelry would be inconsistent with international trade obligationsand could be considered an unjustified trade barrier under the GeneralAgreement of Tariffs and Trade. The FTC comments that a requirement toindelibly mark all jewelry could increase trade frictions because foreigncountries could interpret increased marking required by Customs as an effortto exclude or increase the cost of imported jewelry under the guise ofa consumer protection policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Customs Position</ITAG>After considering all the comments, we have determined that Customs regulatoryefforts should focus on the problem that has been identified relating toNative American-style jewelry.First, it is unnecessary to require indelible marking on all imported jewelryin order to satisfy section 1907(c) of the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988. This provision only pertains to the marking of Native American-stylejewelry, not all jewelry. In addition, section 1907(c) requires that theregulations provide for the indelible marking of such jewelry to the greatestextent possible. Congress recognized by these words that there may be somepractical limitations to be considered.We believe that many of the concerns raised about indelible marking ofall jewelry are legitimate. This type of marking will undoubtedly raisecosts to both manufacturers and consumers, detract from the aesthetic appearanceof the jewelry, and will, in some cases, result in marking which is moredifficult to see than the present methods of marking. Considering the factthat the amount of imported jewelry which looks like Native American-stylejewelry is small, the cost of requiring indelible marking on all jewelryis unwarranted.Second, Customs agrees with those commenters who state that the presentenforcement tools are generally sufficient to ensure that imported jewelrycomplies with the marking laws (<T3>e.g., </T3>the issuance of marking notices, the assessment of markingduties, assessment of liquidated damages where improperly marked merchandiseis not redelivered to Customs, and criminal penalties for the intentionalremoval of the required marking). Although Customs reported a high violationrate regarding country of origin marking of jewelry in 1986, since then,because of increased marking enforcement by Customs, we believe that thisproblem has been greatly reduced.It should also be noted that our proposal to extend the indelible markingrequirements to <T3>all </T3>jewelry was not based on evidence that the present methodof marking all types of jewelry was not adequate, but rather, on a preliminarydetermination that the term ``Native American-style'' jewelry was not readilydefinable. For the reasons explained in the next section on identifyingNative American-style jewelry, we are limiting this term to jewelry whichincorporates ``traditional'' Native American design motifs, materials and/orconstruction. This approach greatly reduces the definition problem andis consistent with the legislative mandate to require indelible countryof origin marking on Native American-style jewelry to the greatest extentpossible.Finally, we are of the opinon that absent a compelling reason for requiringindelible marking, tags or stickers are the preferable method of markingjewelry because they can be more readily seen by the consumer. In addition,they eliminate most of the practical problems associated with indeliblemarking of jewelry noted above. Of course, under present regulations, ifCustoms determines that in a given case the paper label or tag is not sufficientlypermanent to reach the ultimate purchaser based on normal handling of theitem, a more permanent method would be required.In view of allegations by some commenters that the country of origin markingon imported jewelry is not reaching ultimate purchasers, Customs will continueto closely monitor the way jewelry is marked. Continued enforcement byCustoms, accompanied by an increased public awareness of the country oforigin marking requirements of jewelry resulting from the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices, should also lead to a higher rate ofcompliance. While we are unaware of any specific instances of removal ofcountry of origin marking, any information of this nature should be reportedto Customs and the Federal Trade Commission for appropriate action.In light of the numerous concerns raised about indelible marking of alljewelry, the fact that Congress determined that special marking requirementswere warranted with respect to Native American-style jewelry only, andthe fact that imported Native American-style jewelry which looks like jewelrymade by Native Americans constitutes a small segment of imported jewelry,the requirement of indelible and permanent marking for jewelry is limitedto Native American-style jewelry.<ITAG tagnum="84">Identifying Native American-Style Jewelry </ITAG>Section 1907(c) requiring the implementation of regulations concerningcountry of origin marking of Native American-style jewelry resulted froma Senate floor amendment to the trade bill. In the discussion precedingthe adoption of that amendment, Senator Domenici, the amendment's sponsor,inserted into the <T3>Congressional Record</T3> the following statement which he said wasdesigned to provide guidance to Customs in defining Native American handicrafts.<ITAG tagnum="21">The most appropriate definition of what is <T3>genuine</T3> Native American handicraft product (arts, crafts, andjewelry) is found in 25 CFR 308.3a (emphasis added). It reads as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Objects produced by Indian craftsmen with the help of only such devicesas allow the manual skill of the maker to condition the shape and designof each individual product.</ITAG>The regulations proposed by the U.S. Customs Service in 1986 contain appropriatedescriptive information regarding Native American arts, crafts and jewelry.While it is clear that a detailed description of what these items looklike is helpful to a Customs agent, such descriptions cannot be all encompassing.The thrust of the amendment is to ensure that consumers may distinguishbetween authentic Native American products and the look-alike from aroundthe world. The U.S. Customs Service is encouraged to coordinate with the Departmentof the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs to ensure that the intent ofthis provision is carried out. 133 Cong. Rec. S9443-4 (daily ed. July 8,1987). The definition of a <T3>genuine</T3> Native American handicraft found in 25 CFR 308.3(a), isa combination of the producer of the product (Indian craftsmen) and themethod of production (with the help of only such devices as allow the manualskill of the maker to condition the shape and design of each individualproduct). We do not find this definition to be instructive in defining``Native American-style jewelry'' as that term is used in section 1907(c).First, the thrust of andSection;1907(c) is to require indelible marking onimported goods which look like jewelry made by Native Americans but infact were <T3>not</T3> produced by Native Americans. Second, unlike genuine NativeAmerican handicrafts which are by definition produced with the help ofonly such devices as allow the manual skill of the maker to condition theshape and design of each individual product, as the legislative historymakes clear, imported articles which look like Native American jewelrymay have been mass produced rather than handcrafted. Thus, neither portionof the definition regarding the producer of the product nor the methodof production is helpful in identifying imported Native American-stylejewelry. Considering the purpose of section 1907(c), which is to ensure that consumerscan distinguish between genuine Native American products and imported look-alikes,the final regulation will define Native American-style jewelry as: Jewelrywhich incorporates traditional Native American design motifs, materialsand/or construction and therefore, looks like, and could possibly be mistakenfor, jewelry made by Native Americans. While we recognize that not allgenuine Native American jewelry incorporates ``traditional'' design motifs,materials and/or construction, we are of the opinion that it will be themore traditional styles that sellers will try to pass off as authenticgoods, the styles that consumers generally associate with Native Americanjewelry. Numerous comments were received concerning the identification of traditionalNative American-style jewelry. They indicate that most of this jewelryis plain silver or silver set with blue or green opaque material. Othercommenters indicated that the pieces could also contain coral, onyx, lapisand the like. Regarding construction, a few commenters indicated that NativeAmerican-style jewelry gives the appearance of being crudely finished andis hand soldered and hand polished. Based on these comments, we anticipatethat most of the imported jewelry that will be subject to these requirementswill be silver-colored jewelry which is either plain or set with opaqueblue or green stones, and which gives the appearance of being hand made.The regulation, however, will not specify the characteristics of ``traditionalNative American-style'' jewelry since those characteristics are likelyto change over a period of time. While consumers presently are most likelyto mistake silver jewelry with blue or green opaque stones as genuine NativeAmerican, this may not always be the case. Customs will issue guidelinesto be used by importers and field officers in identifying imported NativeAmerican-style jewelry. As the need arises, the guidelines will be amended.<ITAG tagnum="85">Additional Changes to the Proposed Regulation Exception to IndelibleMarking Requirement </ITAG>The proposed regulation states that a string tag or adhesive lable wouldbe permitted as the only means of marking in the case of those few articleswhich are too small to be indelibly marked and do not permit the permanentattachment of a metal or plastic tag. Several commenters suggested thatthe structural characteristics as well as size of the jewelry should beconsidered in any indelible marking exceptions. For example, we are toldthat some jewelry is hollow and cannot be indelibly marked. Some suggestthat allowance should be made for situations where permanent marking wouldbe impractical, unreadable or ruin the value of the article. We believethese suggestions have merit and the final regulatioin permits markingby paper label or string tag where it would be technically or commerciallyinfeasible to mark by the methods generally required for Native American-stylejewelry. The proposed regulation requires that where the indelible country of originmarking is necessarily so small that it can only be read with a magnifyingglass, an additional country of origin adhesive label or hang tag be attached.Several commenters question why the indelible marking should be requiredat all when it is necessarily so small that it can only be read with amagnifying glass. It is argued that in such circumstances, the adhesivesticker or hang tag alone is sufficient. The reason for requiring both methods of marking was to asure that theultimate purchaser would be able to determine (albeit with difficulty)the country of origin even if the paper marking was removed. Upon reconsideration,we believe that this added precaution is not necessary since the use ofpaper labels is permitted in only those few cases where it is not possibleto either legibly mark the item itself or to permanently attach a metalor plastic tag to the item. The final regulation is changed accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finished Jewelry vs. Components </ITAG>Several commenters asked if the regulation will apply to imported jewelrycomponents in addition to finished jewelry. As explained below, importedcomponents that will be substantially transformed in the United Statesprior to retail sale will not be subject to the regulation. Section 305of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304), the statute requiringcountry of origin marking, also specifies various exceptions from marking.For example, section 304(a)(3)(D) provides for an exception from markingan imported article if the marking of its container will reasonably indicatethe country of origin to the ultimate purchaser. It is well establishedthat imported articles which are to be substantially transformed in theUnited States prior to retail sale are excepted from individual markingunder this provision. In such circumstances, the United States manufacturerthat substantially transforms the article is considered the ultimate purchaserand the marking of the container instead of the article itself is permittedpursuant to section 304(a)(3)(D). The country of origin marking regulations, including the regulation onNative American-style jewelry, cannot override the statutory exceptions.Therefore, this regulation is subject to the statutory exceptions, includingsection 304(a)(3)(D). We are clarifying the final regulation on this point.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Comments </ITAG>Several commenters suggested that all genuine Native American jewelry bemarked with its own certifying mark to assure its authenticity and thatthe industry adopt a public relations program encouraging consumers tolook for this mark. Another commenter suggested that all American jewelrybe marked ``Made in USA''. These comments go beyond both the scope of thenotice and Customs authority. We note however that a certifying mark onboth the traditional and more contemporary styles of Native American jewelrywould provide an alternative means for the consumer to identify genuineNative American jewelry and would alleviate some of the concerns that havebeen expressed regarding our decision to limit the requirements of andSection;134.43(c)to ``traditional'' Native American-style jewelry. Finally, several commenters suggested that there should be a way for animporter to determine in advance whether jewelry to be imported is consideredNative American-style jewelry and subject to the special marking requirements.In accordance with the provisions of part 177, Customs Regulations (19CFR part 177), an importer or other interested party may request a rulingfrom Customs on this question with respect to any prospective transaction.For the foregoing reasons, the proposed changes are adopted as modified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>This document does not meet the criteria for a ``major rule'' as specifiedin E.O. 12291. Accordingly, no regulatory impact analysis has been prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), it is certified that the regulation amendment will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Accordingly, it is not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirementsof 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of this document was James C.
