With the help of Western oil companies, the country this yearbecame a net oil exporter for the first time, with revenues of $550million forecast by early 1990.   ``Self-sufficiency in energy is something you really appreciatewhen you've never had it before,'' Economy Minister Mohammed Imadisaid in an interview.   ``The studies show that we have a continuous oil and gas supplyfor our needs and a surplus for export whenever we need the foreignexchange,'' he said.   For the Syrians, whose economy has been in such poor shape itbarely had enough foreign exchange to cover one week's imports, theoil flow offers the prospect of badly needed money.   The modest oil boom has come as Syria struggles to reduce annualinflation of more than 65 percent and repay its $18 billion foreigndebt.   Three-quarters of that is owed to the Soviet Union, mostly forarms supplies for President Hafez Assad's determination to makeSyria strategically equal to neighboring enemy Israel.   The oil strikes have come at a critical time for Syria, which hassuffered political setbacks in the region and is under pressure fromthe Arabs and the Soviets to moderate hardline policies hinderingthe Middle East peace process.   Saudi Arabia this year stopped annual payments to Syria of around$540 million for its role as a frontline Arab state facing Israel.   Other Arab states have long halted aid to Syria, mainly becauseof Assad's alliance with Persian Iran against Arab Iraq in the8-year gulf war.   Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, OccidentalPetroleum of the United States, and France's Total are among 10foreign companies involved in exploring and developing the newfields as quickly as possible.   ``It's a high-pressure job because the Syrians are really in arush to get the oil out of the ground,'' said one explorationexpert, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The better we do, themore we're asked to do.''   Syria has been pumping around 150,000 barrels a day of heavycrude from the Souweidieh fields in the northeast since the early1970s and mixing it with imported light crude for domestic use.   Prospecting at that time by the country's East bloc alliesbrought no results, but advanced technology helped Shell locate theThayyem fields in 1984.   The new wells already are producing around 200,000 barrels a dayof saleable crude, raising overall output to 350,000 barrels a day,more than double the country's needs.   But because the deposits are ``generally small and fractured,exploration will have to be continuous in order to guaranteelong-term supplies,'' the expert said.   Oil Minister Mutanious Habib recently told the Middle EastEconomic Survey, an oil industry newsletter, that another 50,000barrels a day will be added later this year from three new fields.   He said Syria was evaluating potential reserves throughout thecountry in what he called a crucial year for exploration.   The government also has signed a contract with Marathon Oil ofthe United States to develop natural gas deposits south of ancientPalmyra, to be used instead of oil and hydro-power for generatingelectricity.   Imadi said the increased oil output and a record harvestfollowing higher-than-average rainfall helped the economy grow by astaggering 10.7 percent last year.   This year, agricultural production will fall sharply because of awinter drought that is already causing water shortages in Damascus.But officials estimate that the oil boom will still fuel growth ofaround 7.2 percent a year.   Syria is negotiating barter deals to settle accounts with foreigncreditors and cut import bills. Phosphate exports, for example, willpay for importing antibiotics from France and Italy.   A senior government official said that a crackdown on smugglingis working, but that incentives for private businessmen are moreeffective for curbing the black economy.   Contraband ranging from bananas and French cheeses to clothingand computer software arrives in Syria by the truckload fromneighboring Lebanon, foreign residents of Damascus say.   Under the new incentives, businessmen can use up to 75 percent oftheir export earnings to finance imports. They can also go intopartnership with the government in tourism, transportation andagricultural business projects.   To attract expatriate Syrians to invest at home, tax incentivesand a law allowing businessmen to transfer earnings abroad are beingprepared. There are plans, too, for reviving the Damascus stockmarket after a quarter-century gap.   ``It's common sense to have the private sector more activelyinvolved in the economy,'' Imadi said.   But Western diplomats predict it will be a while before theSyrian economy takes off.   ``There's a great commercial tradition here, but because of thecomplex bureaucracy, and corruption, it can't be revived from oneday to the next,'' one commented.   Syrians say they find it hard to manage on salaries that rangefrom about $63 a month for a taxi driver to $125 for a universityprofessor.   The government recently hiked wages by 25 percent, but that onlyseemed to intensify the inflation problem. Gasoline pricesimmediately jumped by 50 percent and some food costs rose by 30percent.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday, June 12</NOTE></DOC>
