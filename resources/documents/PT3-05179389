Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to an ink jet recording apparatus for image      recording by discharging recording liquid (ink) from a discharge port of a      recording head, an ink jet recording head adapted for use in such      apparatus, and an ink jet recording method adapted for use in such      apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  2. Related Background Art </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6, 7A and 7B show an example of conventional ink jet recording      apparatus utilizing an ink tank incorporating an ink absorbent member. </PAR><PAR>  The recording means employed in this apparatus is of cartridge type in      which a recording head 100 and and ink tank 200 are integrally constructed      and are detachably mounted on a carriage. The ink tank 200 of the      cartridge houses an ink absorbent member 202, and ink impregnated and      contained therein is supplied to the recording head 100. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 7B, a recording head chip 100 comprises a discharge unit 102, a      supply tank 104, etc. The discharge unit 102 is provided with discharge      ports 102A formed on a face opposed to the recording medium, liquid paths      extended inwardly therefrom, recording heaters provided as discharge      energy generating members respectively in the liquid paths, and a common      liquid chamber communicating with the liquid paths. The supply tank 104      serves as a subsidiary tank for receiving the ink from the ink tank 200      and guiding the ink to the common liquid chamber of the discharge unit      102. </PAR><PAR>  The ink absorbent member 202, provided in the ink tank 200 and impregnated      with ink, can be composed of a porous material or a fibrous material. A      cover member 204 is provided for the ink tank 200. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 6, recording head cartridges 14 of the form shown in FIG.      7A are positioned and fixed on a carriage 14 by means of pressing members      41 and are capable of reciprocating along guide shafts 21, in a      longitudinal direction, perpendicular to the advancing direction of the      recording material. The positioning on the carriage 15 can be achieved,      for example, by mutual engagement or mutual pressing of positioning parts      formed on the recording head cartridge 14 and the carriage 15. Also, an      electrical connection can be made by coupling a connection pad of a      printed wiring board (not shown) for the discharge unit 102 with a      connector on the carriage 15. </PAR><PAR>  The ink discharged from the discharge ports of the recording head cartridge      14 reaches the recording material 18 which is conveyed by conveying means.      The recording face of the recording material 18 is defined by a platen 19      at a small distance from the discharge face of the recording head      cartridge 14, and a desired image can be recorded by the relative movement      of the recording material 18 and scanning of the recording head cartridge      14. The conveyance of the recording material may be performed by a known      conveying mechanism, either by an independent motor or a motor used for      carriage driving or for driving of a recovery unit for the recording head. </PAR><PAR>  The recording head cartridge 14 receives discharge signals corresponding to      image data from a suitable data source, through a cable 16 and terminals      thereof. There may be provided one or plural recording head cartridges 14      (two cartridges 14 are provided in the drawing), according to the      characteristics required in the recording, for example mono-color      recording, recording with continuous density or full-color recording. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 6, there are further shown a carriage motor 17 for moving the      carriage 15 along the shafts 21, a wire 22 for transmitting the driving      force of the motor 17 to the carriage 15, and a feed motor 20 coupled with      the platen roller 19 for conveying the recording material 18. </PAR><PAR>  In the above-explained recording ink cartridge in which the ink tank and      the recording head are mutually connected, a negative pressure acts on the      ink in the recording head, due to the capillary action of the ink      absorbent member of the ink tank, thus applying a force to suck the ink      from the recording head side toward the absorbent member in the ink tank.      Thus, the balance between the negative pressure and the sucking pressure      resulting from the capillary action of the liquid paths of the recording      head side meniscuses the ink surfaces in the discharge ports. </PAR><PAR>  In such recording means in which the meniscus of ink is maintained by the      balance of the capillary action of the ink tank side provided with the ink      absorbent member and the capillary action of the ink paths of the      recording head side, the liquid head pressure at the discharge ports      varies according to the amount of ink in the ink tank, due to the change      in the negative pressure applied from the ink tank side to the ink paths      communicating with the discharge ports. </PAR><PAR>  The remaining amount of ink in the ink tank and the head pressure of ink at      the discharge port are generally correlated as indicated in FIG. 8. More      specifically, the head pressure at the discharge port is lowered with a      decrease in the remaining amount of ink in the ink tank. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 8, the curves a and b indicate &quot;behaviors&quot; of the head pressure      with absorbent materials of different absorbent abilities, whereby the      curve b respresents a larger absorbent ability. It will be understood that      the change in the head pressure becomes larger as the absorbent ability      increases. Also FIG. 9 shows the relationship between the head pressure      and the amount of ink discharge (quantity per ink droplet) from the      discharge port of the recording head. The ink discharge amount gradually      decreases with the decrease of the head pressure and may become zero at a      certain head pressure. Such a phenomenon is caused by the decrease of head      pressure at the discharge port, resulting from an increase of the negative      pressure in the ink tank, caused by the decrease of the remaining amount      of ink in the ink tank. This is because an increase in the negative      pressure of the ink tank side destroys the balance of pressure between the      ink tank side and the discharge port side, thus increasing the sucking      force on the ink toward the ink tank side. Such increased sucking force on      the ink toward the ink tank side reduces the ink discharge amount, if the      ink discharge power given to the recording head is maintained constant.      With a further decrease in the ink head pressure, the capillary absorbing      force of the ink paths becomes comparable to the negative pressure, so      that the flow into the ink paths after ink discharge is retarded, thus      prolonging the ink refill time, required for replenishing the discharged      ink. Since sufficiently rapid refilling cannot therefore be achieved with      a constant driving frequency, the ink discharge amount decreases rapidly,      and ink discharge may eventually become impossible even though the ink      remains in the ink tank. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 shows the relationship between the head pressure and the refilling      frequency. </PAR><PAR>  As explained in the foregoing, in an ink jet recording apparatus utilizing      a cartridge in which an ink tank incorporating an ink absorbent member and      a recording head are integrally connected, there may be encountered a      variation in the ink discharge amount depending on the remaining amount of      ink in the ink tank. Such variation in the ink discharge amount is      directly reflected in the density of the printed image, and is often      regarded as a technical problem to be solved in an image output apparatus      used for halftone images. </PAR><PAR>  Also, as will be understood from the curves in FIG. 8, the use of an ink      absorbent material with a larger absorbent ability for the purpose of      increasing the ink amount contained in the ink tank, thereby reducing the      operating cost at the device, will result in a larger variation in the ink      discharge amount, thus influencing to an even greater extent the density      or contrast of the printed image. </PAR><PAR>  Also, before the ink in the ink tank can be efficiently used up, the      negative pressure of the ink tank side may increase to disable the ink      discharge, thus reducing the efficiency of ink utilization. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention is to provide a method, in an ink jet      recording apparatus utilizing an ink tank incorporating an ink absorbent      member as explained above, for eliminating the effect of the ink remaining      amount in the ink tank on the ink discharge characteristics, and an ink      jet recording apparatus utilizing such a method. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet recording      apparatus provided with a recording head including ink discharge ports      connected to an ink tank containing ink and serving to discharge the ink      supplied from the ink tank, discharge energy generating members for      generating energy for discharging the ink from the discharge ports, and      means for feeding a recording material on which an image is to be recorded      by the ink discharged from the discharge ports of the recording head,      comprising means for detecting the head pressure of the ink at the      discharge ports and means for regulating the drive condition of the      discharge energy generating members according to the head pressure      detected by the head pressure detecting means. </PAR><PAR>  Still another object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet      recoding head connected integrally with an ink tank containing ink and      provided with discharge ports for discharging the ink supplied from said      ink tank and discharge energy generating members for generating energy to      be utilizing for ink discharge from the discharge ports, comprising means      for detecting the head pressure of the ink at the discharge ports. </PAR><PAR>  Still another object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet      recording method for achieving image recording by driving discharge energy      generating members of the recording head according to the recording      information thereby discharging the ink from discharge ports, comprising      regulating of the driving condition of the discharge energy generating      members acording to the head pressure of the ink at the discharge ports. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, according to the present invention, the driving condition of the      recording head is controlled according to the change in the head pressure      at the discharge ports of the recording head, thereby securing desired ink      discharge condition at the discharge ports. </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore rendered possible to always discharge of ink, thereby      realizing uniform image density, regardless of the amount of ink remaining      in the ink tank. Also, the efficiency of ink can be utilized from the ink      tank. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 1, 3 and 5 are partial views of an embodiment of the ink jet      recording apparatus of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2 and 4 are block diagrams showing examples of method for controlling      the driving condition of the recording head according to the present      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a schematic view of an ink jet recording apparatus; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7A is a magnified perspective view of a recording head connected to an      ink tank, adapted for use in the apparatus shown in FIG. 6; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7B is a cross-sectional view of the recording head shown in FIG. 7A;      and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 8 to 13 are charts showing the influences of various parameters on      the head pressure of ink at the discharge ports. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Now the present invention will be clarified in greater detail by      embodiments thereof shown in the attached drawings. </PAR><PAC>  1st Embodiment </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of an ink jet recording head cartridge in      which an ink tank and a recording head are integrally provided,      constituting a first embodiment of the present invention. In this      embodiment, there is provided a pressure sensor 3 including a      piezoelectric material provided in a predetermined position of a supply      tank 104, so as to be in contact with the ink. The pressure sensor serves      as pressure detecting means for detecting the pressure of the ink in the      supply tank 104 and converting the pressure into an electrical signal.      Thus, the head pressure of the ink at the discharge ports 102A can be      indirectly detected, by correlating the output signal of the sensor with      the head pressure in advance. FIG. 11 shows an example of the relationship      between the output signal of the pressure sensor 3 and the head pressure      of the ink at the discharge ports 102A. The output signal of the pressure      sensor 3 is supplied to a means for varying the driving pulse width not      shown. </PAR><PAR>  The structure shown in FIG. 1, except the pressure sensor 3, is same as      that shown in FIG. 7B. </PAR><PAR>  In the apparatus shown in FIG. 1, the driving condition of the recording      head, for example the pulse duration or frequency of the recording signal      supplied to the discharge energy generating members (for example      electrothermal converting members) for generating thermal energy for      causing ink discharge from the recording head 100 is varied according to      the head pressure indirectly detected by the pressure sensor 3, thereby      obtaining a desired discharge state with a discharge pressure responding      to the change in the head pressure. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a block diagram for varying the duraton of driving pulses for      the recording head, in the first embodiment of the present invention,      wherein shown are the above-mentioned pressure sensor 30; a pulse width      switching device 31; and a recording heater driving device 32. The output      signal of the pressure sensor, representing the head pressure of ink at      the discharge ports, is digitized by an A/D (analog-to-digital) converter      in the switching device 31, and the width of the driving pulses is      determined by a predetermined conversion table between the output signal      of the pressure sensor and the pulse width for maintaining a constant ink      discharge amount. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 shows an example of the relationship between the driving pulse      width and the ink discharge amount. The conversion table of the output      signal of the pressure sensor and the driving pulse width can be prepared      from the relationships shown in FIGS. 9, 11 and 12. (It is to be noted,      however, that the present embodiment is applicable to a case where the      head is used with a heat pressure not exceeding zero.) An electrical      signal is generated with a pulse width, based on said output signal of the      pressure sensor, for maintaining a constant ink discharge amount, and is      supplied to the recording heaters after amplification in the recording      heater driving device. </PAR><PAR>  The ink discharge amount (amount per ink droplet) can therefore be      maintained constant, by regulating the driving pulse width for the      recording head, according to the head pressure of ink at the discharge      ports, indirectly detected by the pressure sensor 3. </PAR><PAR>  In an ink jet recording apparatus of the structure shown in FIGS. 6 and 7A,      7B (utilizing electrothermal converting devices for generating discharge      energy) showing a change in the ink discharge amount from 25 to 18 pl/dot      in the ink remaining ratio (ink remaining amount/initial ink amount in the      ink tank) of 100 to 30%, the structure shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 was added      and the driving pulse width was controlled according to the block diagram      shown in FIG. 2. As a result, the change in the ink discharge amount could      be reduced to a range of 25-23 pl/dot within the same range of the ink      remaining ratio. </PAR><PAR>  The ink absorbent member contained in the ink tank can be so constructed as      to provide smooth ink flow toward the recording head, thereby improving      the efficiency of ink utilization and the ink discharge characteristics.      Such an effect can be realized for example by unevenly compressing the ink      absorbent member or by combining it with another member in such a manner      that the pore rate of said absorbent member increases toward the recording      head. </PAR><PAC>  2nd Embodiment </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a schematic view of the ink tank and the recording head in a      second embodiment of the present invention. Detecting pins 4, constituting      a pair of electrodes for detecting the remaining amount of ink are      inserted into the ink absorbent member 200 in the ink tank. The electrical      resistance between the detecting pins 4 varies according to the decrease      of ink in the absorbent member 200. FIG. 13 shows an example of the      relationship between the remaining amount of ink in the absorbent member      and the resistance between the detecting pins. As the resistance between      the detecting pins 4 rapidly increases with a decrease in remaining ink,      the head pressure of ink can be estimated from the resistance. Except for      said detecting pins 4, the structure is same as that shown in FIG. 7B.      Also in this embodiment, the ink discharge amount from the discharge ports      can be regulated by varying the driving condition of the recording head,      for example the drive frequency or the pulse width for the discharge      energy generating members according to the head pressure of ink at the      discharge ports. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a block diagram for a device for controlling the drive frequency      of the recording head and the carriage moving speed in the second      embodiment, wherein shown are a detecting device 41 for the detecting the      resistance between the detecting pins; a driving frequency switching      device 41; a head driving signal generating device 42; a recording heater      driving device 43; a carriage motor driving signal generating device 44;      and a carriage motor driving device 45. The resistance between the      detecting pins is converted by the detecting device 40 into a signal which      is supplied to the frequency switching device 41. The device 41 compares      the resistance corresponding to the input signal with a predetermined      reference resistance, and sends a frequency switching signal to the signal      generating devices 42, 44 in case the resistance corresponding to the      input signal is larger. The reference resistance can be determined from      the resistance between the detecting pins corresponding to the head      pressure at the discharge ports, just in front of the rapid decrease in      the ink refilling frequency, as well as from the relationships shown in      FIGS. 8, 10 and 13. In response to the frequency switching signal, the      head driving signal generating device 42 and the carriage motor drive      signal generating device 44 respectively generate drive signals for      driving the discharge energy generating members with a frequency for      maintaining a substantially constant ink discharge amount and for reducing      the revolution of the carriage motor for obtaining a carriage speed      providing a normal image in response to the frequency, and send the drive      signals respectively to the driving devices 43, 45. The drive signal is      supplied to the recording heaters after suitable amplification in the      recording heater drive device. Also, the other drive signal is supplied to      the carriage motor after conversion into a stepping motor driving signal,      in the carriage motor driving device. In this manner the recording heaters      and the carriage movement are switched to a predetermined condition, for      example for obtaining a constant ink discharge amount. </PAR><PAR>  The above-explained control of the head driving frequency and the carriage      driving speed according to the head pressure of ink indirectly detected by      a sensor detecting the ink remaining amount prevents ink discharge failure      resulting from a decrease in the refilling frequency, to improves the      efficiency of ink utilization, and achieves image recording without a      significant change in the ink discharge amount. Also, the cost of the      apparatus can be reduced since the head pressure of ink is indirectly      detected by the sensor for the ink remaining amount, instead of an      exclusive sensor for the head pressure. </PAR><PAR>  The structure shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 was added to an ink jet recording      apparatus of the structure shown in FIGS. 6 and 7A, 7B (utilizing      electrothermal converting members for generating energy for ink      discharge), and the resulting devices exhibited a change in the ink      discharge amount from 20 to 10 pl/dot in the above-defined ink remaining      ratio from 40 to 20%, and became incapable of ink discharge at an ink      remaining ratio of 20% or lower. The switching of the frequency for      driving the energy generating members and the carriage moving speed (by      reducing the frequency to 2/3 at the ink remaining ratio of 40%) could      control the ink discharge amount within a range from 20 to 15 pl/dot and      could maintain the ink discharge down to an ink remaining amount of 10%. </PAR><PAR>  In the foregoing first and second embodiments, the ink tank and the      recording head are integrally connected, but the present invention is also      applicable to the case in which they are separated and mutually connected      by connecting means such as a tube 300, as shown in FIG. 5. Also in the      first embodiment, a similar effect can be obtained not by controlling the      driving pulse width for the discharge energy generating members but by      controlling the driving voltage, the recording head temperature etc.,      switched singly or in combination, according to the head pressure of the      ink at the discharge ports. Furthermore, the effect of the first      embodiment can be further enhanced by combining the frequency switching of      the second embodiment. It is furthermore desirable, in the first and      second embodiments, for improving the precision of detection, by employing      a combination of plural different sensors for detecting the head pressure      of ink, such as the pressure sensor shown in FIG. 1 and the detecting pins      shown in FIG. 3. An additional advantage is obtained in the first or      second embodiment, by employing the switching of driving condition      according to the difference in position of the ink tank. </PAR><PAR>  As explained in the foregoing, the present invention provides a method for      controlling the driving condition of the recording head according to the      change in the head pressure of ink at the discharge ports, and a structure      for exploiting the method. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention allows a device to achieve a constant ink discharge      amount regardless of the change in the remaining ink amount in the ink      tank, thereby realizing ink jet recording with uniform image density.      Also, the present invention prevents the failure in ink discharge      resulting from the decrease in head pressure of ink at the discharge      ports, thereby enabling to use more ink in the ink tank, and reducing the      operating cost of an ink jet recording apparatus utilizing an ink tank      incorporating an ink absorbent member. </PAR><PAR>  Among various ink jet recording methods, the present invention is      particularly advantageous for the recording head and recording apparatus      of a bubble jet recording method. </PAR><PAR>  The basic structure and working principle of this recording method are for      example disclosed in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,723,129 and 4,740,796. This      recording method is applicable to either of so-called on-demand recording      and continuous recording, but is particularly useful in application to the      on-demand recording, since an electrothermal converting member provided in      a liquid path or on a sheet bearing liquid (ink) thereon is given at least      a driving signal corresponding to the recording information and induce a      rapid temperature increase exceeding the boiling point of the liquid,      thereby generating thermal energy in the converting member and causing the      liquid to boil on a thermal action face of the recording head, thereby      generating a bubble in the liquid in one-to-one correspondence to the      drive signal. The expansion and contraction of the bubble are utilized to      discharge the liquid (ink) through the discharge port, thereby forming at      least a droplet. The drive signal is preferably formed as a pulse, since      the expansion and contraction of the bubble can be made instantaneously,      thus achieving ink discharge with superior response. Such a pulse-shaped      drive signal is preferably that disclosed in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,463,359      and 4,345,262. Also, still further improved recording can be achieved by      employing the condition disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,124 with      respect to the temperature elevation rate of the thermal action face. </PAR><PAR>  The structure of the recording head is not limited to the combination of      discharge ports, liquid paths and electrothermal converting members,      including linear or rectangular liquid paths, as disclosed in the      above-mentioned patents, but also includes the structure in which the      thermal action areas are provided in bent areas, as disclosed in the U.S.      Pat. Nos. 4,558,333 and 4,459,600. Furthermore, the present invention is      applicable also to a structure in which a slit common to plural      electrothermal converting members constitutes discharge parts for the      converting members, as disclosed in the Japanese Laid-open Patent Sho      59-123670, or a structure in which apertures for absorbing pressure waves      resulting from thermal energy are provided corresponding to the discharge      ports, as disclosed in the Japanese Laid-open Patent Sho 59-138461. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, a full-line recording head of a length corresponding to the      width of the largest recording medium recordable on the recording      apparatus can be realized by the combination of plural recording heads as      disclosed in the above-mentioned patents or by a single integral recording      head, and the present invention can be more effectively applicable to such      recording heads. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is furthermore applicable to a chip-type replaceable      recording head which can be electrically connected to the apparatus and      can receive ink supplied therefrom upon mounting on the recording      apparatus, or a recording head of an integral cartridge type. </PAR><PAR>  Also, in the structure of the recording apparatus, the presence of recovery      means or preparatory auxiliary means for the recording head is preferable,      as they further stabilize the effect of the present invention. More      specifically, there is preferred, for stable recording, the use of capping      means for the recording head, cleaning means, pressurizing or sucking      means, electrothermal converting members or other heating elements, or      preliminary heating means composed of combinations thereof, or the      execution of a preliminary ink discharge operation different from the      recording operation. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, the present invention is extremely effective not only for a      recording mode using a main color such as black, but also for recording      apparatus recording in plural colors for which there may be provided a      single integral recording head or plural recording heads. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
