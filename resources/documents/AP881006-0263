The proposal, which would pay $28 for each of the 39.27 millionTW shares Coniston does not already own, had been expected. Theaggressive New York investment firm acknowledged two weeks ago thatit had amassed a 19 percent stake in TW and might seek to acquirethe company.   In a letter delivered to the TW board today, Coniston said thatwhile it considered the offering price to be ``full and fair,'' itwas ``willing to consider offering more if (TW) can demonstratesufficient business prospects to justify doing so.''   The Coniston principals have said that they consider TW, whichoperates the Denny's and Hardee's fast-food chains, to be a primecandidate for a leveraged buyout. In such a buyout, the purchaserrelies on borrowed money, secured by a target company's assets, tofinance an acquisition. The loans are repaid out of cash flow anddivestitures.   After an initial delay in trading, TW opened at $26.50 a share,up $1.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange.   Coniston paid an average $19 a share for the 9.28 million TWshares it purchased over a period of days in September. At thecurrent offering price, the acquisition would cost the firm anadditional $1.13 billion.   Coniston principal Paul Tierney Jr. said in a telephoneinterview that he and his partners met with TW Chairman FrankSalizzoni and other executives recently.   While that meeting was ``quite cordial and reasonable,'' Tierneysaid, the conclusion of the TW board ``was that it did not wish tosell the company at that time to Coniston.''   Tierney said he hoped that the much more specific terms _ suchas price and financing _ spelled out in today's letter would givethe TW board reason to reconsider.   If the board again rejected the overture, Tierney said, thepartnership might proceed with a hostile tender offer directly toshareholders. Coniston requested a response by Wednesday.   Formed in late 1986 as a result of the liquidation of TransWorld Corp., TW Services reported profits of $47.2 million onrevenue of $2.5 billion last year. The company's $850 millionacquisition of the Denny's chain in late 1987 is expected to boostrevenues to the $3.5 billion mark this year.   Denny's operates about 1,250 restaurants nationwide. TW alsoowns the Chicago-based Canteen Corp., which contracts food, vendingand recreational services throughout the nation at places likestadiums and national parks.   The company also owns Spartan Food Systems Inc. of Spartanburg,S.C. The unit operates more than 400 Hardee's restaurants and 200Quincy Family Steak houses, mostly in the southeastern part of thecountry.   Coniston Partners, with a warchest estimated at about $700million, typically takes large positions in companies and uses thatclout to force management to sell the company or make changes thatboost the stock price.</TEXT></DOC>
