Northand three co-defendants boiled down to simple allegations of fraud.   ``I am not trying anything else; it's a fraud trial,'' U.S.District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell told one of North's lawyers, JohnD. Cline, during a hearing on defense motions to dismiss the centralconspiracy charge in the case.   ``It is fraud in the sense that Chief Justice (William Howard)Taft and the Supreme Court thereafter have consistently applied'' tothe conspiracy statute, the judge said.   The defense, supported Friday by a Justice Department brief,contends North and his three co-defendants could not be prosecutedfor obstructing Congress's foreign affairs authority by running asecret arms-supply network to the Nicarguan rebels.   The 1924 decision written by Taft held that defendants did nothave to violate a particular law in order to be guilty ofobstructing government or depriving it of honest service.   Gesell also expressed puzzlement over defense contentions thatthe diversion of arms-sale profits to the rebels, known as Contras,did not violate the so-called Boland Amendent restrictions onmilitary aid.   ``I am having a difficult time understanding why it is necessaryto decide what the Boland Amendment means,'' the judge said.   The defense contends that the series of amendments enacted byCongress to ban direct military aid by U.S. intelligence agenciesdid not apply to the National Security Council, where North was anaide until his dismissal two years ago.   ``The indictment clearly depends upon the application of theBoland Amendment to the National Security Council,'' Cline toldGesell, arguing that if it did then it was unconstitutional.   But Gesell expressed concern over allegations that North andothers falsely assured Congress they were complying with the seriesof Boland Amendments.   ``Is it your position that the executive branch can representthrough its people that they are complying with a statute and at thesame time be affirmatively, knowingly disobeying it because thestatute is unconstitutional?''   ``That is not the position I am taking,'' Cline said.   ``Are you saying the president of the United States affirmativelyintended to skim off the profits of the `enterprise' and use them tobuy arms in Nicaragua?'' the judge asked later.   When Cline demurred again, the judge said the defense argument``seems like Jello. It doesn't have anything I can pick up with myhands.''   North's appearance today in court was his first since Gesell saidthe former presidential aide was cynically trying to place himselfabove law.   In a written opinion, Gesell harshly criticized North for arguingthat he couldn't be prosecuted for lying to then-Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III or destroying documents during the 1986 presidentialinvestigation of the Iran-Contra affair.   That opinion rejected an earlier attempt by North to have chargesagainst him dismissed. The judge said North ``fails to appreciatethe gravity of his alleged conduct.'' He added that the retiredMarine lieutenant colonel's argument ``reveals a skewed attitudetoward our constitutional form of government.''   Gesell already has rejected a number of defense motions todismiss some of the 15 charges against North, who is the irst of thefour Iran-Contra defendants set to be tried. No date has been setfor the trial.   North is accused of conspiring with former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter, arms dealer Albert Hakim and retired AirForce Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to divert illegally U.S.-Iranarms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   Still pending are defense motions attacking the centralconspiracy counts against North and his co-defendants, includingarguments that the Boland Amendment _ which banned U.S. military aidto the Contras at the time _ did not apply to the National SecurityCouncil.   North also contends that the diversion of arms-sale profitswasn't illegal because the weapons were no longer U.S. governmentproperty when they were sold to Iran.   The defense argues that Secord and Hakim owned the weapons afterpurchasing them as middlemen in the arms-for-hostage deals.   The Justice Department lent support to North's defense on Friday,by challenging Walsh's contention that the defendants can beprosecuted for conspiring to defraud Congress of its ability tooversee foreign affairs.   Walsh contends the clandestine arms-supply network to theNicaraguan rebels stymied congressional oversight of foreign policyand enforcement of the Boland Amendment.   But the Justice Department said the president, not Congress, hasthe power to enforce laws. It argued in a friend-of-the-court briefthat Walsh ascribed to Congress a too-powerful role in foreignaffairs.   ``Because of the doctrine of executive privilege and thepresident's inherent foreign affairs authority, Congress' authorityto compel disclosure of information concerning covert activity isnecessarily subject to formidable constitutional limitations.''   Nor can Congress ``prohibit the president and his subordinatesfrom exercising the president's authority to engage in diplomacy orto exercise covert influence in the realm of external affairs,'' thedepartment said.   Assistant Attorneys General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., of thecriminal division, and Douglas W. Kmiec, head of the office of legalcounsel, said the department was not arguing for or againstdismissal of the central conspiracy count.   But Dennis conceded that adoption of the department's argumentsmight ``narrow the scope'' of the charge.</TEXT></DOC>
