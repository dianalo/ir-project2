The pocket phone system is made by MatsushitaCommunication, a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,which markets products under the Panasonic brand name. Itwould be the first phone to work both in the office and as acellular phone and is aimed at a future service the phoneindustry calls &quot;PCS&quot; or &quot;personal communications service.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Matsushita's phone uses the same frequency as cellularphones do. However, it carries software that's beenprogrammed to know if it's making calls from an office or anyother institutional phone network, or from a place -- such asa car -- where a regular cellular phone would be used.   Southwestern has been testing the phone in St. Louiscounty and plans to expand its test with several as yetunidentified business customers in Des Peres, Mo., in early1992. The Federal Communications Commission in September gaveSt. Louis-based Southwestern permission to test the system.But the agency would still have to give final approval foruse in the public phone network.   Matsushita's new phone system underscores the increasinginterest Japan's consumer electronics suppliers are showingin pocket phones, particularly in the U.S. market. Suchcompanies as Matsushita, Sony Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. andMitsubishi are marketing sleek pocket cellular models thatrival phones from Motorola Inc. and Ericsson-GE, a jointventure of Sweden's LM Ericsson and General Electric Co.   While a Matsushita spokesman said it's &quot;too early to tellhow well the new phone is accepted by customers,&quot; he addedthat pocket phones &quot;are going to be pretty common.&quot; A Sonyofficial agreed. &quot;We view the whole area oftelecommunications as one of the big growth areas ofopportunity in the next 10 years,&quot; said Mike Lang, directorof telecommunications products at Sony Corp. of America'sTelecommunications Division. &quot;The growth of the traditionalconsumer electronics market is slowing down.&quot;   Sony is in a joint venture with BellSouth Corp. to developand test pocket phones that would be used in a future PCSthat isn't as expensive as cellular service and uses adifferent frequency than cellular systems do.   The Panasonic system made by Matsushita is more versatile,said Casey Dworkin, president of Personal TechnologyResearch, a research firm in Waltham, Mass. &quot;That's a realadvantage in that you only need one phone,&quot; he said. &quot;Mostexciting is the fact that you can transfer a call from youroffice to your cellular phone as if it's an extension of youroffice phone system.&quot;   Southwestern Bell said its tests show the phone doesn'tinterfere with the cellular phone network. That's because achip inside the phone is programmed so that the phoneautomatically links up with the closest system -- office orpublic cellular network -- when it's turned on, said AndrewM. Geisse, Southwestern's director of strategic marketing.   A customer's phone would typically have two phone numbers,one for the office and the other for cellular phone calls. Ifthe customer is in the office or even on a campus, such as auniversity or a hospital, the office switch willautomatically route calls to the pocket phone. Once thecustomer is beyond the range of the phone system's radiotransmitter/receiver, the phone will automatically linkitself to the public cellular network.   An office or campus phone network could use up to 120&quot;base stations&quot; -- the radio transmitters/receivers that passphone calls to and from a cellular phonesaid Mr. Geisse. &quot;Wehave a four-story building using four base stations, and theywork fine with no interference,&quot; he said.   Although Matsushita hasn't given Southwestern the finalpricing for the product, Mr. Geisse envisions phones costing$1,000 to $1,500 initially and service that costs the same asit costs to make a regular call from an office or a cellularphone.</TEXT></DOC>
