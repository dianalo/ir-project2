One of the first groups to leave was 69 children who mettheir French adoptive families at a Bucharest airport last January.  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  INFANT; TRADE; SALE; ROMANIA; WEST; WORLD; FAMILY  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  ON A COLD day recently in the Romanian capital, a U.S. visitor jumped out of ataxi and ran to catch up with a pregnant woman she had spied walking down thestreet. After a brief conversation, the two parted -- having agreed that thewoman would give up her baby for adoption by the American in return forseveral thousand dollars.;    Such scenes reflect a growing desperation inthis Eastern European country. Between Romania's poverty and corruptofficialdom, its citizens' hopeless outlook and Westerners in search of white,European infants, the baby trade is booming here.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ROMANIAN BABY TRADE BOOMING AMID DESPAIR  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Many Romanians, like 26-year-old Mihaela, are horrified by the thinlydisguised sale of children. She is five months pregnant with her first child,and she and her husband, Radu, still don't know how they will make ends meeton their monthly salary of 5,400 lei -- about $160 at the official exchangerate -- once the baby arrives. But they are determined to find a way.;   Thousands of other Romanians have given up trying.;    &quot;These people are beingoffered more money on the spot than they've seen in their entire lives,&quot; saysone Western official in Bucharest.;    Romania has long been a favoreddestination of West European couples searching for babies to adopt. Romaniandictator Nicolae Ceausescu, toppled and executed during the December 1989revolution, obsessively sought to boost the country's population.Contraceptives were unavailable, abortion outlawed and women subjected tomonthly gynecological examinations at their workplace.;    THE RESULT was aspate of unwanted children put in state institutions. For West Europeancouples, as well as for a handful of Americans, Romania became a source ofwhite infants hard to find in other European countries.;    However, in 1988,Ceausescu banned adoptions by foreigners in reaction to a foreign news articleaccusing him of selling Romanian babies. The ban not only affected futureadoptions, but also suspended hundreds of adoptions in process, leavingprospective parents and children alike in agonizing limbo.;    The new rush toadopt Romanian babies began in the aftermath of the December 1989 revolution,when television sets in living rooms across the United States alternateddevastating footage of hollow-eyed children staring listlessly out of crowded,filthy cribs in Romanian orphanages with reports of joyful U.S. familiesflying their newly adopted babies to the West.;    Some of these children hadbeen waiting for up to four years to be united with their adoptive families.The issue gained a high profile through the work of some European human-rightsactivists. Even the French Foreign Ministry, lobbied by eager adoptiveparents, took up the cause.;    One of the new Romanian government's firstpost-revolutionary acts was to allow the suspended adoptions to be completedswiftly. But implementation of the regulations on adoption by foreignersremained murky until the parliament transferred the authority for grantingforeigners permission to adopt from the president's office to the JusticeMinistry last July.;    Even with these changes, however, Westerners havefound the adoption process complicated and time-consuming. Most Americansenlist the aid of Romanian lawyers and free-lance adoption specialists toguide them through the maze of officials.;    Few have succeeded in adoptingRomanian children without getting caught up in the corruption that greases thewheels of Romanian society. Americans have been known to spend anywhere from$2,000 to $20,000, excluding travel expenses, in their quest to adopt Romanianchildren.;    The Romanian Bar Association, the governmental organization forlawyers, charges a fee from $600 to $1,000. U.S. adoption agencies working tohelp locate babies in Romania cost an additional $8,000 to $10,000. The restof the money goes in the form of &quot;gifts&quot; to bureaucrats, orphanage officials,middlemen and the children's parents and guardians -- to anyone who can helpidentify a child to adopt.;    Many Americans bypass both the lawyers and theformal organizations and opt instead for free-lance adoption facilitators whomay speed up the process.;    Personal connections also count. One prospectivecouple learned that four children they were hoping to meet in one orphanagewere being &quot;saved&quot; for the daughter of a U.S. religious activist who hastraveled frequently to Romania.;    Some Westerners also won't deal withstate-run orphanages, since they tend to house older children in poor healthrather than the young babies most adopting families crave. U.S. immigrationlaw requires, however, that a child be proven an orphan or unequivocallyabandoned in order for adoptive parents to bring it back to the UnitedStates.;    GROWING numbers of Americans go home empty-handed. The U.S.Embassy in Bucharest issued only 485 immigrant visas for newly adoptedchildren from January through December 1990, although many more families triedin vain to adopt Romanian children this year.;    For those Romanians whostruggle to keep their offspring, they will enjoy a few meager benefits. Forinstance, when the baby comes, the government will pay 300 lei in childsupport every month -- almost enough to buy one baby shoe. And the couple willno longer have to pay 10 percent of their salaries for not having a child -- atax, introduced by Ceausescu, which the post-revolutionary government has notoverturned.;    However, at least as long as the economic crisis persists, theorphan population will inevitably increase, and Romanian reaction to thechildren's plight will fall far short of the need.;    A recent French visitorto an out-of-the-way village recalls how local elders had refused to alloworphans from a neighboring institution even to be buried in their cemetery.Well-acquainted with the habit of turning a communal back to society'sdispossessed, perfected during the Ceaucescu years, some Romanians find iteasier to send their children where they're wanted -- even if it's half aworld away.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JUDITH INGRAM, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Bucharest, Romania  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910103  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,004  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 3, 199100003152,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
