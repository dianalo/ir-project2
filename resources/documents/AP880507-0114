Police said 51 people were killed and 70 wounded.   Using tanks, howitzers and mortars, pro-Syrian Amal militiasquads battled bands from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, for the second day. They also made grenade-throwing foraysinto each other's territory, police said.   Ambulances evacuated some casualties as the thud of explodingshells echoed across Beirut. Thick smoke billowed from burningapartment blocks in several parts of the densely populated district.   But the intensity of the battle in the labyrinthine slums, atraditional Hezbollah stronghold, prevented Lebanese Red Cross andcivil defense teams from evacuating many of the wounded, who laybleeding on the streets.   Saturday's victims raised the casualty toll to 67 killed and 120injured. The violence began before dawn Friday and appeared part ofan Amal drive to crush its main rival.   Hospitals packed with wounded issued urgent appeals for blood.   Civilians caught in the cross fire, who have huddled inbasements and bomb shelters since Friday, tried to flee when foodand water began running out.   Syrian soldiers, deployed in neighboring west Beirut in Februarylast year to end three years of anarchy, watched from sandbaggedpositions as refugees scampered from their undergound hiding places.   Reporters saw a dozen women, children and old men carryingmattresses and clothes duck sniper fire to dart across the mainstreet in the Ghobeiri neighborhood to safety.   ``We've been in the basement since before dawn Friday,'' saidAzzam Abdallah as he shepherded his twin daughters and wife Ilham,all clad in nightgowns, into the Syrian position on the westernedge of the battle zone.   ``We ran out of food. We ran out of milk for the children,''said Adballah, who works as a taxi driver at Beirut airport.   Abdallah's 7-year-old daughters, Joumana and Zaynab, were tooscared to say anything. They rushed into a black Mercedes stoppedby a Syrian soldier who ordered the driver to take the family to``any safe area.''   A police spokesman said Amal gunners pounded intersectionslinking the neighborhoods of Haret Heik, Bir el-Abed and Hay Madi,Hezbollah's three main strongholds, to try to block Hezbollah'ssupply lines.   The ferocity of the fighting forced the senior Shiite cleric inLebanon, Sheik Mmohammed Mahdi Shamseddine, to evacuate hisresidence in Haret Hreik, police said.   The fighting raged despite cease-fire calls from Shamseddine andSheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's reputed spiritualguide.   ``My sons, I call upon you to stop this war in which there is novictor,'' Fadlallah said in an appeal broadcast throughout southBeirut over loudspeaker systems in mosques.   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for Shiitefactions holding foreign hostages in Lebanon, and many of thosereleased in the past three years have said they were held in southBeirut at one time or another. There was no word as to whether thelatest fighting endangered the captives.   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, sent 7,500 troops intoMoslem west Beirut on Feb. 22, 1987, in a bid to end three years ofwar.   But the Syrians have not moved into the Shiite stronghold ofsouth Beirut, apparently to avoid a head-on collision with Iran'sallies.   The Amal-Hezbollah clashes were the heaviest between the twosides since Amal cracked down on Hezbollah forces last month.Sixty-two people were killed and 150 wounded in that four-dayconfrontation in south Lebanon.   The latest confrontation began Friday when four Amal militiamenwere killed in an ambush in south Beirut. Amal blamed Hezbollah forthe deaths.   Police said incendiary shells scored direct hits on severalapartments in south Beirut, starting dozens of fires. Firefighterscould not approach because of the violence.   Police said most of the estimated 250,000 residents of southBeirut spent the night in basements and bomb shelters as gunmenfought it out in the narrow alleys.   Machine gun fire blocked the main highway leading to Beirutinternational airport on the southwestern edge of the disputedregion. However, passengers managed to reach the facility throughside streets, and flight schedules were not affected, police said.   Also in Beirut, U.S. State Department emissary April Glaspiebriefed Lebanon's Moslem leaders on efforts exerted by the Reaganadministration to end the Lebanese crisis.   ``We as Americans are always hopeful we can do something toassist all the Lebanese to put an end to their tragedy,'' Glaspietold reporters after meeting with Sunni Moslem acting PrimeMinister Salim Hoss.   In south Lebanon, two Israeli-backed militiamen were killedSaturday when a roadside bomb exploded, knocking out their armoredpersonnel carrier, U.N. sources said.   They said gunners of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Armymilitia responded by shelling three nearby villages, but a casualtyreport was not available.</TEXT></DOC>
