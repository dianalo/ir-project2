Theestimated weighted-average dumping margins are shown in the ``Continuationof Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. We also determinethat critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of certain classesor kinds of AFBs from Japan, as outlined in the ``Critical Circumstances''section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since our notice of preliminary determinations (53 FR 45343, November 9,1988), the following events have occurred. All respondents and the petitionerrequested that the final determinations in all of the antidumping dutyinvestigations be postponed until not later than 135 days after the dateof publication of the preliminary determinations, pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A)of the Act. On December 2, 1988, we issued a notice postponing our finaldeterminations until not later than March 24, 1989 (53 FR 49581, December8, 1988). That notice also announced the scheduling of the public hearingin these investigations. Verification of the questionnaire responses was conducted in Japan andthe United States during November and December 1988 and January 1989. A public hearing was held on February 21, 1989. Petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties filed pre- and post-hearing briefs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by these investigations. These determinations cover ball bearings, mounted or unmounted, and partsthereof (ball bearings); spherical roller bearings, mounted or unmounted,and parts thereof (spherical roller bearings); cylindrical roller bearings,mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (cylindrical roller bearings);needle roller bearings, mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (needleroller bearings); and spherical plain bearings, mounted or unmounted, andparts thereof (including rod end bearings) (spherical plain bearings).For a complete description of these products, see Appendix A to the ``FinalDeterminations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the FederalRepublic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as Appendix A), which ispublished in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG>Subsequent to the initiation of these investigations, the Department determinedthat the products under investigation constitute five separate classesor kinds of merchandise. After consideration of all comments, arguments,and information submitted by the parties, we find no reason to alter thatdecision. For a full discussion of our position on class or kind of merchandise,see Appendix B which is cited below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing </ITAG>We determine that petitioner has standing with respect to each of the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise described in Appendix A. For a full discussionof standing see Appendix B, which is cited below. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Issues </ITAG>Appendix B to the ``Final Determinations of Sales at Less than Fair Value:Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereoffrom the Federal Republic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as AppendixB) contains detailed discussions of all issues raised in a timely mannerby the parties to the proceeding in each of the concurrent antidumpingduty investigations involving AFBs from nine countries. The first partof Appendix B addresses all general issues raised during these investigationsand our treatment of these topics. The general issues discussed thereinare listed below. 1. Class or Kind of Merchandise 2. Standing 3. Products Covered 4. Basis for Cost of Production Investigations 5. Market Viability 6. Alternative Reporting Requirements 7. Critical Circumstances 8. Administrative Protective Order Issues Following the discussion of general issues, all remaining comments areaddressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Periods of Investigation </ITAG>The periods of investigation (POI) are October 1, 1987, through March 31,1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from Japan to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.For the reasons cited below and in the Best Information Available sectionof Appendix B, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have determinedthat use of the best information available is appropriate for Koyo SeikoCo., Ltd. (Koyo), with respect to all of its sales of the subject merchandise,and for Minebea Co., Ltd. (Minebea), with respect to all of its sales ofball bearings. This statutory provision requires the Department to usethe best information available ``whenever a party or any other person refusesor is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner or inthe form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation.''Because Minebea failed to report the correct quantities of its sphericalplain bearing sales, we have used the best information available to compensatefor these unreported sales (<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B). For NSK, where the respondent did not report certain ball bearings in conformitywith our requirements (<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available and Difference in Merchandisesections of Appendix B), and did not report on its revised computer tapescost of production data for certain AFBs, we have used best informationavailable, based on the criteria discussed below and in the Best InformationAvailable section of Appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importationinto the United States, we based the United States price on purchase price,in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. In those cases where sales were made through a related sales agent in theUnited States to an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation,we also used purchase price as the basis for determining United Statesprice. For these sales, the Department determined that purchase price wasthe most appropriate determinant of United States price based on the followingelements: 1. The merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated U.S. buyer, without being introduced into the inventoryof a related selling agent; 2. This was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and 3. The related selling agent located in the United States acted only asa processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyer. Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionsof the exporter as merely having been relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroaddoes not change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.Where the sale to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importationinto the United States, we based United States price on exporter's salesprice (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd., (Koyo) See, </T3>Best Information Available sectionof Appendix B.B. <T3>Minebea Co., Ltd. (Minebea): See, </T3>Best Information Available sectionof Appendix B.C. <T3>Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp. (Nachi):</T3> Nachi reported that more than 33percent by volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products sold inthe home market (<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B).Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated purchase price and ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We madedeductions from purchase price and ESP, where appropriate, for foreigninland freight (which included inland insurance), export brokerage (whichincluded containerization), ocean freight, air freight, marine and airinsurance, import brokerage, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight (whichincluded inland insurance), in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of theAct. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for rebates and discounts.We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for credit expenses,advertising, inspection fees, commissions, and indirect selling expenses(including inventory carrying costs, pre-sale warehousing, product liabilitypremiums, and all general indirect selling expenses), pursuant to sections772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act. We modified the adjustment for total indirect selling expenses allocatedover U.S. sales. During verification, Nachi identified that the originalamount reported for indirect selling expenses was understated due to anerror. Nachi officials provided the Department with a revised calculationwhich we verified and have accepted for the final determinations. Nachi claimed that it incurred direct advertising expenses on its salesto original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We are treating these expensesas indirect selling expenses because we verified that this advertisingwas not directed at the customers of these OEMs. During verification, Nachi provided a list of purchase price sales forwhich the prices changed after the POI. Based on this information, we deletedthese sales from the purchase price sales database for purposes of thefinal determinations, since the price change resulted in a new date ofsale. D. <T3>Nippon Seiko K.K. (NSK):</T3> NSK reported that more than 33 percentby volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products sold in the homemarket (<T3>See</T3>, Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B).However, NSK performs further manufacturing in the United States with respectto certain ball bearing sales. For purposes of these final determinations,we have not included further manufactured merchandise in our calculationof United States price. For a full discussion of this issue, see the AlternativeReporting Requirements section of Appendix B. Accordingly, we used non-furthermanufactured U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. As noted above under the Fair Value Comparisons section, NSK did not reportthe cost of production data for certain matched home market sales of ballbearings. In addition, for certain U.S. sales, NSK made comparisons toidentical home market products which were sold only to related partiesin the home market, despite instructions to NSK to report the first unrelatedsale. When these home market sales and the further manufactured U.S. saleswere dropped from comparisons, less than 33 percent of U.S. ball bearingsales were compared to identical merchandise in the home market. Therefore,to reach the 33 percent threshold, we did the following. First, we calculatedthe margins for those non-further manufactured U.S. sales that had identicalhome market comparisons. Second, we found the quantity of non-further manufacturedU.S. sales that had no home market comparisons. To that quantity, we assignedthe higher of NSK's calculated margin or the highest margin calculatedfor another respondent. Then, we summed these two quantities and comparedthis total to the quantity needed to reach the 33 percent threshold. Wecalculated the difference and assigned to it NSK's calculated margin.In addition, as discussed above in the Fair Value Comparisons section,NSK did not report certain other ball bearings in conformity with our requirements(<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available and Difference in Merchandisesections of Appendix B). For these ball bearings, we have applied bestinformation available by weighting the quantity of these sales using thehigher of NSK's calculated margin or the highest margin calculated foranother respondent. We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated customersin the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, forforeign inland freight (which included inland insurance), export brokerage(which included containerization), ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S.brokerage, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight (which included U.S. inlandinsurance), and harbor and merchandise processing fees, in accordance withsection 772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions, where appropriate,for discounts and rebates. We made further deductions, where appropriate,for credit expenses, inspection fees, repacking in the United States, andindirect selling expenses (including inventory carrying costs, productliability premiums, and all general indirect selling expenses), pursuantto sections 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act. The Department recalculatedthe reported credit expenses and the inventory carrying costs. (<T3>See, </T3>Credit and Inventory Carrying Costs section of Appendix B).Because NSK reported an insignificant percentage of purchase price salesas identical merchandise, when compared to total U.S. sales, we did notcalculate margins based on these reported transactions. E. <T3>NTN Toyo Bearing Co., Ltd. (NTN): </T3>In order to meet the minimumreporting requirement of 33 percent (<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B),NTN had to report both identical and similar home market matches whichwe used in our price-to-price comparisons. However, NTN performs furthermanufacturing in the United States with respect to certain ball bearingsales. For purposes of these final determinations, we have not includedfurther manufactured merchandise in our calculation of United States price.For a full discussion of this issue, see the Alternative Reporting Requirementssection of Appendix B. Accordingly, we have used those non-further manufacturedU.S. sales with identical and similar home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., and delivered price to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for foreign inland freight (which included inland insurance), brokerageand handling (which included containerization), ocean freight, marine insurance,U.S. duty, harbor fees and merchandise processing fees, and U.S. inlandfreight (which included U.S. inland insurance), in accordance with section772(d)(2) of the Act. We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for credit expenses (<T3>See, </T3>Credit and Inventory Carrying Costs section of Appendix B),inspection fees, repacking in the United States, commissions, and indirectselling expenses (including product liability premiums, inventory carryingcosts, technical service expenses, inventory insurance, advertising, andall general indirect selling expenses) pursuant to sections 772(e) (1)and (2) of the Act. Because the quantity of the subject merchandise sold as purchase pricesales constituted a minimal percentage of NTN's total sales to the UnitedStates, we are disregarding these sales for purposes of these determinations.II. Spherical Roller Bearings A. <T3>Koyo: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. B. <T3>Nachi:</T3> Nachi reported that by volume more than 33 percent of itsU.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore,we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated purchase price and ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings.C. <T3>NSK: </T3>In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent, NSK reported identical home market matches. As noted above underthe Fair Value Comparisons section, NSK did not report the cost of productiondata for certain home market sales of spherical roller bearings. In addition,for certain U.S. sales, NSK made comparisons to identical home market productswhich were sold only to related parties in the home market, despite instructionsto NSK to report the first unrelated sale. When these home market saleswere dropped from our comparisons, less than 33 percent of U.S. sphericalroller bearing sales were compared to identical merchandise in the homemarket. Therefore, to reach the 33 percent threshold, we used, as bestinformation available, the higher of NSK's calculated margin or the highestmargin calculated for another company. We weighted this best informationavailable rate with NSK's calculated rate to find the estimated dumpingmargin. We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated customersin the United States. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings. D. <T3>NTN: </T3>NTN reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b. and deliveredprice to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustments wereidentical to those described above for ball bearings. III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A. <T3>Koyo: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. B. <T3>Nachi: </T3>Nachi reported that by volume more than 33 percent of itsU.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore,we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., c.i.f., and delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings, except that there were no purchaseprice sales of cylindrical roller bearings. C. <T3>NSK: </T3>NSK reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used these sales in our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated customersin the United States. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings. D. <T3>NTN: </T3>NTN reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used these sales in our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b. and delivered price to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings. Because the quantity of the subject merchandise sold as purchase pricesales constituted a minimal percentage of NTN's total sales to the UnitedStates, we are disregarding these sales for purposes of these determinations.IV. Needle Roller Bearings A. <T3>Koyo: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. B. <T3>NTN: </T3>In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent, NTN had to report both identical and similar home market matcheswhich we used in our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., and delivered price to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings. Because the quantity of the subjectmerchandise sold as purchase price sales constituted a minimal percentageof NTN's total sales to the United States, we are disregarding these salesfor purposes of these determinations. V. Spherical Plain Bearings A. <T3>Minebea: </T3>In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of33 percent (<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B),Minebea had to report both identical and similar home market matches whichwe used in our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on thepacked, f.o.b., U.S. shipping point prices to unrelated customers in theUnited States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for freightforwarding expenses, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight,and U.S. brokerage and handling expenses, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)of the Act. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts.We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for U.S. creditexpenses, technical service expenses, and indirect selling expenses (includingadvertising, warranty expenses, product liability expenses, inventory carryingcosts, and all general indirect selling expenses), pursuant to sections772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act. Minebea calculated the product liability expense based on the yearly expense.We recalculated this expense based on the period of investigation. Forinventory carrying costs, Minebea did not report the period between productionand transit in their calculation. We have included this period using informationobtained at verification for purposes of this adjustment. Since Minebea did not report U.S. sales made during the POI of certaintypes of spherical plain bearings which are included in the scope of theseinvestigations (<T3>See,</T3> Appendix A and Products Covered section of Appendix B), wehave used best information available for these unreported U.S. sales. Tocalculate the estimated weighted-average margin listed in the ``Continuationof Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice, we weighted thequantity of unreported sales using the margin found for NTN's sphericalplain bearings with the margin calculated for Minebea's reported sales.NTN's margin was used because it was the highest calculated rate for sphericalplain bearings (<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B). B. <T3>NTN: </T3>For spherical plain bearings, NTN reported that more than33 percent by volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products soldin the home market. Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with home marketidentical matches in our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b. and delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market sales or constructed value, where appropriate.The calculation of foreign market value for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>Koyo: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. B. <T3>Minebea: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B.C. <T3>Nachi: </T3>Petitioner alleged that Nachi's home market sales of ballbearings were made at prices below the cost of production (COP). Basedon the petitioner's allegation, we gathered and verified data on Nachi'sproduction costs for ball bearings. We calculated the COP on the basisof Nachi's cost of materials, labor, other fabrication costs, and general,selling, and administrative expenses. The COP data submitted by Nachi wasrelied upon, except in those instances when the costs were not appropriatelyquantified or valued. Those instances were: (1) Interest expense was adjustedto reflect the interest expense related to the current operations of theNachi consolidated entity; and (2) general expenses were increased to includeinventory write-offs which were incurred by the Nachi factory. In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market prices where there were sufficient home marketsales at or above the COP. We used constructed value (CV) as the basisfor foreign market value when there were insufficient sales at or abovethe COP. We calculated the foreign market value based on CV, where appropriate,in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. The CV included the materials,fabrication, general expenses, profit, and packing. In all cases: (l) Actualgeneral expenses were used, since these exceeded the statutory minimumrequirement of 10 percent of materials and fabrication; (2) the statutory8 percent minimum profit was applied; (3) imputed credit and inventorycarrying costs were included in selling expenses; therefore, interest expensereflected on the company books was reduced for a portion of the expenserelated to these activities in order to avoid double counting; and (4)all the changes noted under the COP were also made to those cost elementsin CV. We added U.S. packing. We deducted from CV all direct and indirectselling expenses up to the amount of the ESP offset. For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculatedforeign market value based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. We made deductions from the home market price,where appropriate, for rebates, inland freight, and home market packing.However, we disallowed the claimed freight expense on returns of merchandise.We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section773(a)(1) of the Act. For comparisons involving purchase price sales, we made adjustments tothe home market price, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses(including a bank transfer fee), inspection fees, technical services, warrantyexpenses, yen clause adjustments, and advertising, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15.For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for home market credit expenses,technical services (expenses incurred in testing bearings), and advertising,and we made an adjustment to the home market price for indirect sellingexpenses (including pre-sale warehousing, inventory carrying costs, pre-saledelivery expenses to warehouse, and all general indirect selling expenses),in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home market products usedin fair value comparisons are identical to the products sold in the UnitedStates, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandise were required.Nachi made a claim that it incurred direct advertising expenses on itssales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We are treating theseexpenses as indirect selling expenses because we verified that this advertisingwas not directed at the customers of these OEMs.  Nachi claimed personnel expenses incurred when rendering technical servicesas a direct selling expense. Employee salaries are nonvariable expensesand, as such, are not allowable as direct selling expenses. Therefore,we have treated these personnel expenses as indirect selling expenses.Nachi made a claim for warehousing expenses. We are treating these expensesas indirect selling expenses since they were incurred before the date ofsale reported by Nachi in its responses. (<T3>See, </T3>Selling Expenses section of Appendix B).For an explanation of the yen clause adjustment, <T3>see </T3>the Date of Sale section of Appendix B.D. <T3>NSK: </T3>Petitioner alleged that NSK's home market sales of ball bearingswere made at prices below COP. Based on the petitioner's allegation, wegathered and verified data on NSK's production costs for ball bearings.We calculated COP on the basis of NSK's cost of materials, labor, otherfabrication costs, and general, selling, and administrative expenses. TheCOP data submitted by NSK was relied upon, except in those instances whenthe costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. These were: (1)The cost of manufacturing for each bearing was adjusted to reflect thedepreciation expense on idle machinery; (2) certain non-operating incomeand expenses which were incurred by NSK were allocated to the subject bearings.These non-operating items included gains and losses on the disposal andsale of fixed assets, inventory disposals and write-downs, and raw materialsadjustments; (3) interest expense was increased to reflect the amortizationof bond issue expenses by NSK; and (4) interest income was adjusted toreflect only interest income accruing from short-term investments relatedto the current operations of NSK. In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market prices where there were sufficient home marketsales at or above the COP. We used CV as the basis for foreign market valuewhen there were insufficient sales at or above the COP. We calculated the foreign market value based on CV, where appropriate,in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. The CV included the materials,fabrication, general expenses, profit, and packing. In all cases: (1) Actualgeneral expenses were used, since these exceeded the statutory minimumrequirement of 10 percent of materials and fabrication; (2) the statutory8 percent minimum profit was applied; (3) imputed credit and inventorycarrying costs were included in selling expenses; therefore, interest expensereflected on the company books was reduced for a portion of the expenserelated to these activities in order to avoid double counting; and (4)all the changes noted under the COP were also made to those cost elementsin CV. We added U.S. packing. We deducted from CV all direct and indirectselling expenses up to the amount of the ESP offset. For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculatedforeign market value based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. We made deductions from the home market price,where appropriate, for home market packing. Since U.S. price is based onESP, we made further deductions from home market price, where appropriate,for home market credit expenses and commissions, and we made an adjustmentto the home market price for indirect selling expenses (including pre-saleinland freight, inventory carrying costs, advertising, and all generalindirect selling expenses), in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). We addedU.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)of the Act. Since all home market products used in fair value comparisonsare identical to the products sold in the United States, no adjustmentsfor physical differences in merchandise were required. NSK claimed rebates and discounts paid on home market sales as a directselling expense. These adjustments were revised on a customer-specificand, in some instances, part-specific basis. Based on the results of verification,some of these claimed expenses have been accepted as direct expenses; otherswere disallowed. (<T3>See, </T3>Rebates and Discounts section of Appendix B.) NSK's reported inland freight includes pre-sale transportation expenses.Because NSK did not provide information to break out the pre- and post-saleportions of the expense, we treated this entire expense as indirect. (<T3>See, </T3>Movement Charges section of Appendix B). E. <T3>NTN: </T3>Petitioner alleged that NTN's home market sales of ball bearingswere made at prices below COP. Based on the petitioner's allegation, wegathered and verified data on NTN's production costs for ball bearings.We calculated COP on the basis of NTN's cost of materials, labor, otherfabrication costs, and general, selling, and administrative expenses. TheCOP data submitted by NTN was relied upon, except in those instances whenthe costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. These were: (1)The costs of manufacturing each bearing were adjusted to reflect the depreciationexpense on idle machinery; (2) a loss on disposal of machinery incurredby NTN was allocated to the subject bearings; (3) interest expense wasincreased to reflect the interest expense paid by NTN on bonds; and (4)interest income was adjusted to reflect only interest income accruing fromshort-term investments related to the current operations of NTN. In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market prices where there were sufficient home marketsales at or above the COP. We used CV as the basis for foreign market valuewhen there were insufficient sales at or above the COP. We calculated the foreign market value based on CV, where appropriate,in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. The CV included the materials,fabrication, general expenses, profit, and packing. In all cases: (1) Actualgeneral expenses were used, since these exceeded the statutory minimumrequirement of 10 percent of materials and fabrication; (2) the statutory8 percent minimum profit was applied; (3) imputed credit and inventorycarrying costs were included in selling expenses; therefore, interest expensereflected on the company books was reduced for a portion of the expenserelated to these activities in order to avoid double counting; and (4)all the changes noted under the COP were also made to those cost elementsin CV. We added U.S. packing. We deducted from CV all direct and indirectselling expenses up to the amount of the ESP offset.For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculatedforeign market value based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. We made deductions from the home market price,where appropriate, for discounts, inland freight and insurance, and homemarket packing. Since U.S. price is based on ESP, we made further deductionsfrom the home market price, where appropriate, for home market credit expensesand royalty expenses, and we made an adjustment to the home market pricefor indirect selling expenses (including advertising, inventory carryingcosts, warehousing, product liability premiums, technical services, commissions,and all general indirect selling expenses), in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c).We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section773(a)(1) of the Act. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.16, we made furtheradjustments to the home market price, where applicable, to account fordifferences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise. For purposes of the final determination, we have treated a portion of theinland freight and insurance expense as an indirect expense, based on informationprovided for the record, to reflect pre-sale transportation expenses. Thisissue and our methodology are discussed in the Movement Charges sectionof Appendix B. We have also treated NTN's commissions as indirect expensesas these commissions were allocated over all home market sales.NTN made a claim for warehousing expenses. We are treating these expensesas indirect selling expenses rather than as direct expenses since the warehousingexpenses were incurred before the date of sale reported by NTN in its response.(<T3>See</T3>, Selling Expenses section of Appendix B). II. Spherical Roller Bearings A. <T3>Koyo: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. B. <T3>Nachi: </T3>Petitioner alleged that Nachi's home market sales weremade at prices below the COP. Based on petitioner's allegation, we gatheredand verified data on Nachi's production costs. We calculated the COP asdescribed above for ball bearings. We found that Nachi had sufficient homemarket sales above COP to use solely price-to-price comparisons. For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculatedforeign market value based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings. C. <T3>NSK: </T3>Petitioner alleged that NSK's home market sales were madeat prices below the COP. Based on petitioner's allegation, we gatheredand verified data on NSK's production costs. We calculated the COP as describedabove for ball bearings. We calculated foreign market value based on CV,where appropriate, as described above. For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculatedforeign market value based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings. D. <T3>NTN: </T3>Petitioner alleged that NTN's home market sales were madeat prices below the COP. Based on petitioner's allegation, we gatheredand verified data on NTN's production costs. We calculated the COP as describedabove for ball bearings. We calculated foreign market value based on CV,where appropriate, as described above. For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculatedforeign market value based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings except that no adjustment was made for differencesin the physical characteristics of the merchandise since we used only identicalproduct comparisons. III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A. <T3>Koyo: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. B. <T3>Nachi: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on the packed,delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings when foreignmarket value was compared to ESP. There were no comparisons to purchaseprice because there were no purchase price sales of cylindrical rollerbearings. C. <T3>NSK: </T3>Petitioner alleged that NSK's home market sales were madeat prices below the COP. Based on petitioner's allegation, we gatheredand verified data on NSK's production costs. We calculated the COP as describedabove for ball bearings. We calculated foreign market value based on CV,where appropriate, as described above. For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculatedforeign market value based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings. D. <T3>NTN: </T3>Petitioner alleged that NTN's home market sales were madeat prices below the COP. Based on petitioner's allegation, we gatheredand verified data on NTN's production costs. We calculated the COP as describedabove for ball bearings. We calculated foreign market value based on CV,where appropriate, as described above. For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculatedforeign market value based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings except that no adjustment was made for differencesin the physical characteristics of the merchandise since we used only identicalproduct comparisons.IV. Needle Roller BearingsA. <T3>Koyo: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. B. <T3>NTN: </T3>Petitioner alleged that NTN's home market sales were madeat prices below the COP. Based on petitioner's allegation, we gatheredand verified data on NTN's production costs. We calculated the COP as describedabove for ball bearings. We found that NTN had sufficient sales above itsCOP to use solely price-to-price comparisons. For these price-to-price comparisons, we calculated foreign market valuebased on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated customers in the homemarket. The adjustments were identical to those described above for ballbearings. V. Spherical Plain Bearings A. <T3>Minebea: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on the packed,delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions,where appropriate, for inland freight. We did not make an adjustment forhome market and U.S. packing since, as best information available, we haveconsidered packing expenses to be identical in both markets (<T3>see, </T3>Movement Charges section of Appendix B). Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we deducted credit expenses fromthe home market price. We also made an adjustment to home market pricefor indirect selling expenses (including advertising, inventory carryingcosts, and all general indirect selling expenses), in accordance with 19CFR 353.15(c). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.16, we made further adjustmentsto the home market price, where applicable, to account for differencesin the physical characteristics of the merchandise. We have recalculated home market credit expenses and home market inventorycarrying costs using the verified short-term interest rate and the numberof days in inventory (<T3>See, </T3>Credit and Inventory Carrying Costs section of Appendix B).In addition, we have excluded from our calculations one transaction whichconsisted of samples because we considered it to be outside the ordinarycourse of trade. B. <T3>NTN: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on the packed, deliveredprices to unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments wereidentical to those described above for ball bearings except that no adjustmentwas made for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandisesince we used only identical product comparisons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we made currencyconversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). For comparisons involvingESP transactions, we used the official exchange rates in effect on thedates of U.S. sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, asamended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currencyconversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Japan. Section735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) (i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports. Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on basket TSUSA categories, we requested specific data on shipmentsof the subject merchandise as the most appropriate basis for our determinationsof critical circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that company-specificcritical circumstances determinations better fulfill the objective of thecritical circumstances provision of deterring specific companies that maytry to increase imports massively prior to the suspension of liquidation.We have asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigations to supplymonthly volume shipment data from January 1986 through the present in orderfor the Department to base the critical circumstances determinations oncompany-specific data. We did not verify the shipment data provided byKoyo, and Minebea refused to provide such data on its ball bearing shipments(<T3>See, </T3>Critical Circumstances section of Appendix B). Minebea alsofailed to provide shipment data for all of its spherical plain bearings.Therefore, as best information available, we are assuming that importsof ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, spherical roller bearings,and needle roller bearings from Koyo have been massive over a relativelyshort period of time. We are also assuming as best information availablethat imports of ball bearings and spherical plain bearings from Minebeahave been massive. Based on our analysis of the monthly shipment data submittedby respondents and the use of best information available as discussed above,we have found that imports of the following classes or kinds of merchandisefrom the companies listed below have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time. 1. Ball Bearings_Koyo, Minebea 2. Spherical Roller Bearings_Koyo, Nachi, NTN, NSK 3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings_Koyo, NSK 4. Needle Roller Bearings_Koyo 5. Spherical Plain Bearings_Minebea, NTN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(B) aremet for the above companies and classes or kinds of merchandise.For the companies and classes of merchandise listed above, we then examinedrecent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currently no findingsof dumping of the subject merchandise by Japanese manufacturers, producers,or exporters in the United States. We also reviewed the antidumping actionsof other countries made available to us through the Antidumping Code Committeeof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. On July 19, 1984, as setforth in Council Regulation No. 2089/84, the European Economic Community(EEC) imposed antidumping duties on ball bearings with a greatest externaldiameter of not more than 30 millimeters from Japan. On June 24, l985,as set forth in Council Regulation No. 1739/85, the EEC imposed antidumpingduties on ball bearings with a greatest external diameter of more than30 millimeters from Japan. On February 5, 1987, as set forth in CouncilRegulation No. 374/87, the EEC imposed antidumping duties on casted orpressed steel housings fitted with ball bearings from Japan. As this constitutesa history of dumping of ball bearings from Japan, we find that the requirementsof section 733(e)(1)(A) are met with respect to ball bearings. With respect to the remaining four classes or kinds of merchandise, itis our standard practice to impute knowledge of dumping under section 735(a)(3)(A)of the Act when the estimated margins in our determinations are of sucha magnitude that the importer should realize that dumping exists with regardto the subject merchandise. Normally we consider estimated margins of 25percent or greater to be sufficient. (<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy</T3>(52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987).) However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the United States through a related company, we consider thatlower margins may be sufficient. (<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; CertainInternal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan</T3> (53 FR12552, April 15, 1988).) Since Koyo, Minebea, and NSK sell in the UnitedStates through related companies, and their margins are sufficiently high,we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(A) are met for thesecompanies with respect to the classes or kinds listed below. Therefore,the following chart sets forth our company-specific determinations withrespect to the existence of critical circumstances for each company andeach class or kind of merchandise from Japan.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <H1>  </H1><H1>Critical circumstances </H1> Ball bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Koyo <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Minebea <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Nachi <D>no. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NSK <D>no. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>no. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>no. </D></ITAG>Spherical roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Koyo <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Nachi <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NSK <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>no. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>no. </D></ITAG>Cylindrical roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Koyo <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Nachi <D>no. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NSK <D>no. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>no. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>no. </D></ITAG>Needle roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Koyo <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>no. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>no. </D></ITAG>Spherical plain bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Minebea <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>yes. </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>Except where noted, we verified the information used in making our finaldeterminations in accordance with section 776(b) of the Act.
