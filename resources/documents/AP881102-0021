Final figures for the July-September quarter aren't due out untilnext month, but James Barth, chief economist of the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board, said Tuesday that the nation's 3,048 Sandamp;Ls lostabout $2 billion.   That's substantial, but it's down significantly from losses of$3.6 billion in the previous quarter and $3.9 billion in the firstthree months of this year.   Sandamp;Ls, hard hit in depressed oil regions of the Southwest, aresuffering their worst year since the Depression. The industry lastearned a small profit in the first three months of 1987.   Barth, speaking at the U.S. League of Savings Institutions annualconvention, attributed shrinking losses to regulators' stepped-uppace of Sandamp;L rescues and closings, totaling 137 so far this year.   ``Losses, rather than being reported on the books of theinstitutions, are being transferred to the books of the (deposit)insurance fund,'' he said.   Also, because most of the rescue packages guarantee restructuredinstitutions against future loss as well as taking away past loss,there is no way of telling from industry numbers if losses in thoseinstitutions are continuing.   R. Dan Brumbaugh, a private analyst and former bank boardeconomist, said the new loss number does not necessarily indicatethe cost of cleaning up the Sandamp;L mess, estimated by regulators at $45billion to $50 billion, is getting better.   ``I would say the problem continues to grow,'' he said.   Moreover, he said, thrift institutions, as well as commercialbanks, are more vulnerable now to an economic downturn than at anytime in 50 years.   ``We have fragile institutions ... that could get significantlyworse even in a mild recession,'' Brumbaugh said.   Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate Bancorp inLos Angeles, said thrifts next year likely also face a one-halfpercentage point increase in long-term interest rates and a fullpoint increase in short-term rates.   Higher rates make it more expensive for thrift institutions toacquire funds for lending.   Thrift institutions in the past have struggled to remainprofitable during periods of rising rates, but James W. Christian,chief economist of the U.S. League, said currently solventinstitutions would remain stable because rates on about a third ofthe loans they hold fluctuate with the market.   However, Barth warned that insolvent institutions in Texas, wheremuch of the industry's losses are concentrated, would be twice asendangered by higher interest rates as solvent Sandamp;Ls.</TEXT></DOC>
