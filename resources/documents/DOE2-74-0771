<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0771 </DOCNO><TEXT>Many theories have been given to account for the high transition temperaturesin the oxide superconductors. While most are based on pairing, they differas to the origin of the attractive interaction that gives rise to thepairs and whether the pairing is weak or strong. If weak ({lambda} andless;-- 0.5), the energy range of the paring interaction must be wider thanis consistent with one mediated solely by phonons. With measurementson single crystals becoming available, giving data covering a wide rangeof frequencies and temperatures, it is possible to narrow down the possibleoptions. The data show that anisotropic 3D models are required. Observedisotope shifts indicate that phonons must play a role, but additionalmechanisms are likely necessary to account for the high T/sub c/'s. Thermal,magnetic and transport data are consistent with anisotropic Ginzburg-Landautheory near T/sub c/, with expected departures at low temperatures.</TEXT></DOC>
