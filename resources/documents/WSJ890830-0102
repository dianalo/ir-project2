To get a better measure of minorities -- traditionally the &quot;hard-to-count&quot; segment of the population -- the bureau for the first time has hired three minority agencies to carry out campaigns targeting blacks, Hispanics and Asian Americans for the 1990 census.    Mingo Group of New York is handling the black account; Castor GSandamp;B Advertising, also of New York, is focusing on Hispanics; and Muse Cordero Chen, a Los Angeles agency, will tailor ads for Asian Americans. WPP Group's Ogilvy andamp; Mather unit remains the lead agency for general census advertising.    Each of the agencies is working on ad campaigns that will run from January to May. The census begins in March.    &quot;We're hoping to do better counting these people than we've done in the past,&quot; says Peter Bounpane, assistant director of the Census Bureau. He says the undercount rate for the total population in 1980 was 1.4%. By contrast, the undercount rate for blacks was 5% or 6%. The rate was similarly high for other minority groups.    Mr. Bounpane says he hopes the minority communications experts will be able to drive home the point that census results are entirely confidential. Officials speculate that minorities avoid being counted out of unfounded fears that government authorities have access to the data. Illegal aliens, for instance, worry their names will be passed to immigration officials.    The Census Bureau isn't the only group struggling with this issue. The American Marketing Association in Chicago sponsored a case-study competition among college students on the problems of persuading minorities to take part in the census.    Winning teams from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville suggested for one that community leaders should be enlisted to promote the fact that census reporting is crucial for proper political representation.    Sales Cheer the Makers    Of 'Occasionless' Cards    GREETING CARDS aren't just for birthdays or holidays anymore. Alternative cards, those not tied to any specific occasion, are booming -- even to the surprise of manufacturers.    According to Packaged Facts Inc., the alternative-card segment of the greeting card market grew 25% last year. It also accounted for most of the industry's overall 5% growth, the New York-based research firm says.    Alternative cards include blank cards and cards with everyday jokes, such as those featuring the Ziggy comic strip character or drawings by Gary Larson, the Far Side cartoonist.    &quot;We had no idea the market would turn out to be this big,&quot; says John Sullivan, general manager of Hallmark Cards Inc.'s alternative card division. He says Hallmark, based in Kansas City, Mo., is readying a &quot;major&quot; new line of alternative cards that will be introduced later this year.    Industry executives point to a younger, more impulsive card buyer as a reason for the jump. Another factor is increased distribution of alternative cards at grocery stores, drug stores and mass merchandisers.    &quot;The size of the greeting card department in food stores has tripled in the last 10 years,&quot; says Ed Fruchtenbaum, vice president at American Greetings Corp. in Cleveland.    For the industry, it's a great bonus that the alternative segment isn't cyclical or seasonal. Alternative cards are less dependent on holiday sales and offer more opportunity for growth. Says Mr. Fruchtenbaum: &quot;There's a fixed number of birthdays in the world.&quot;    One Man's Luxury Is    Another Man's Waste    MORE THAN 75% of Americans think that it's a waste of money to buy a luxury car costing $40,000 or more, to gamble at a casino and to own a car phone, according to a study by Bruskin Associates, a New Brunswick, N.J., market research firm.    The study -- based on interviews with 1,000 men and women -- suggests not too surprisingly that household income is a key factor in the way many people rate the value of purchases and activities. For example, 38% of those with annual family income under $40,000 said that taking vacations in foreign countries is a waste of money; only 19% of those with family incomes greater than $40,000 felt that way.    Perhaps more surprising were some large differences of opinion even when the so-called luxury item costs just a bit more than simpler versions of the same product or service. A full 71% of families making $40,000 or less said imported beer is a waste of money; 59% of those making over $40,000 felt that way. Many respondents, but especially those with higher incomes, believe seeing Broadway shows, investing in the stock market or dining at expensive restaurants are worthwhile expenses.    Odds and Ends    THE SEVEN most common prefixes and suffixes in U.S. company names are Ameri, Nat, Mark, Star, Uni, Lead and Inter, according to Delano Goldman andamp; Young Inc., a New York naming specialist that conducted a broad search of business names and trademarks. . . . Word of mouth will have to sell Gentleman Jack, a new super-premium whiskey. The product, Brown-Forman Corp.'s first new whiskey since Jack Daniels was introduced 100 years ago, won't be supported by advertising. Officials hope the news will spread among patrons of fancy restaurants and selected liquor stores. </TEXT></DOC>
