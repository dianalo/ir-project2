Auden                                                                                                          Last fall, as armies prepared to go to war in the MiddleEast, a psychoanalysis of Saddam Hussein was spread thatmight have amused Sigmund Freud.   The Iraqi ruler reportedly had a dream in which theprophet Mohammed scolded him for pointing his missiles in thewrong direction. The next day, Robert R. Butterworth, a LosAngeles psychologist, dashed off a statement to the press.&quot;Sigmund Freud said dreams are repressed unconscious needs,wants and wishes . . .,&quot; said Dr. Butterworth, adding thatthe dream suggests Saddam Hussein might be belligerent partlybecause of an unconscious feeling of impotence. &quot;Theunconscious is difficult to fool,&quot; the psychologist declared.   While Dr. Butterworth's analysis may be debatable, itsorigins are clear. The ideas descend directly from thoseespoused by Freud almost 100 years ago. Indeed, searching forhidden motives to explain people's behavior is perhaps themost enduring legacy the Viennese doctor left to the 20thcentury.   &quot;It seemed to give a new and exciting explanation foreverything,&quot; writes Paul Johnson in his book &quot;Modern Times.&quot;&quot;Like Einstein and Marx, Freud gave the elite a sense thatthe world wasn't as it had seemed.&quot;   Starting in the 1890s, in a bid to cure &quot;nervousdisorders,&quot; Freud began describing what remains the mostcomprehensive and revolutionary theory of the mind everproposed. At its core was Freud's notion that the source ofhis patients' ills lay in the unconscious -- a shrouded realmof thoughts, fantasies, memories and dreams embedded inchildhood and radiating control over one's feelings andactions for life.   Freud theorized that by identifying and exploring pastexperiences and accepting their sovereignty over one's life,a person can gain relief from a wide range of emotionalproblems. Although Freud didn't discover the unconscious, hisinsight into its makeup was brilliant and original. &quot;Hisparticular contribution was to take a shadowy . . . poeticnotion, lend it precision, and make it into the foundation ofa psychology by specifying {its} origins and contents . . .and its imperious ways of pressing toward expression,&quot; writesPeter Gay, a psychoanalyst and Yale history professor, in his1988 biography &quot;Freud: A Life for Our Time.&quot;   Freud's concept of a dynamic and roiling unconscioushelped him father psychoanalysis, a radical therapy foruntangling past experiences. At various times during thiscentury, it has ruled psychiatry and psychology. It is thefoundation upon which stands most psychotherapy used fortreating millions of people for problems ranging fromdepression to anxiety. Even contemporary beliefs aboutchild-rearing flow directly from Freud.   Terms Freud invented, such as neurosis, ego, id,sublimation and inferiority and Oedipus complexes, are partof everyday language. His extensive writings -- a mountain ofbooks, essays and letters -- are the material for aburgeoning school of &quot;psychoanalytic&quot; criticism, which isproducing fresh views on art, literature, politics, historyand culture.   Yet 52 years after Freud died in London, having barelyescaped the Nazis in Austria, his theories continue to bechallenged. Psychoanalysis as a treatment for most seriousmental ills is considered by many a failure; its use islimited to those with plenty of time and money. The mostpassionate debates in psychiatry now are about the besttreatment for depression: the latest drugs or thepsychoanalytic techniques spawned by Freud -- or both.   But it is a tribute to Freud's lasting influence that hisideas can still arouse controversy as fiery as when he wasalive. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, a psychiatrist who presidedover an archive of Freud's writings 10 years ago, made hisreputation by questioning whether Freud honestly reportedobservations of his patients. Last February, a gathering ofthe American Association for the Advancement of Science heardsome of the strongest evidence ever assembled debunkingFreud, describing him as a poor scientist who based histheories more on instinct than on well-crafted research orreproducible findings.   &quot;Many of Freud's most essential concepts were based uponerroneous and now outmoded assumptions from 19th-centurybiology,&quot; says Frank Sulloway, a historian of science atMassachusetts Institute of Technology, who organized themeeting. &quot;Freud erected his psychoanalytic edifice on a kindof intellectual quicksand, which doomed many of his mostimportant theoretical conclusions from the outset.&quot;   As important, Dr. Sulloway argues, is that Freud'sevidence for many of his ideas -- his published histories ofsix patients -- is filled with exaggerated claims oftreatment success. Any scientist today who carried outsimilar embellishments of an experimental therapy would beseverely reproached or even dismissed as a fraud, Dr.Sulloway says.   Still, Dr. Sulloway, who has spent much of his careeranalyzing Freud's research, acknowledges that the breadth ofFreud's impact on Western society &quot;is hard to comprehend.&quot;Says Dr. Sulloway, &quot;The world is different because of him.It's precisely because his influence is so pervasive thatit's important to understand the strengths and limitations ofhis work.&quot;   The man who was born in Freiberg, Moravia, in 1856understood long before he died in 1939 that &quot;Freud&quot; meant nolonger just a man but also a doctrine around which stormsincessantly swirled. Even he had come to see his life on aloftier scale, saying, with typical poesy, that his missionwas to &quot;agitate the sleep of mankind.&quot;   Like many of his generation, Freud was captivated byCharles Darwin's explanation of the origin of man, writesPeter Gay. Freud was driven to medicine and then to neurologyby an intense curiosity about &quot;the nature of things.&quot;   But even as a youngster, writes Dr. Gay, Freud realizedthat the &quot;nature he most wanted to understand was humannature.&quot; As early as high school, he showed an &quot;unabashedinquisitiveness&quot; about the most personal details of friends'lives and was inclined to make &quot;psychological perceptions&quot;about them.   Once he became a physician, Freud was deeply frustrated bymedicine's inability to treat patients who suffered variousforms of &quot;hysteria,&quot; a common catch-all diagnosis foranxiety, stress, aberrant behaviors, multiple personalitiesand psychosomatic ills. At the time, nervous disorders werethought to be a byproduct of a physical illness. Freud soongrew to believe, perhaps instinctively, that the roots ofthese disorders lay elsewhere.   His concern led him to Paris in 1885, where he studiedbriefly with a neurologist who was pioneering the use ofhypnosis to treat hysterics. Freud at first was enthralled bythe curative powers of hypnotic suggestion, then grewdisenchanted by its limits. About half the patients couldn'tbe hypnotized, and the &quot;cures&quot; often were transitory. ButFreud became convinced that hysteria was a mental, notphysical, malady, an idea he never abandoned.   Several years later, Freud and his colleague and mentor inVienna, Josef Breuer, made a breakthrough. Dr. Breuer hadbeen treating a young woman for hysteria. The woman wasparticularly adept at storytelling, and when she reminisced,her symptoms abated. She called this her &quot;talking cure.&quot;   Dr. Breuer's tale of the woman, called Anna O., galvanizedFreud. He became certain that excavating episodes from one'slife could produce a catharsis, a venting of psychic steam,that was curative. The two men published their conclusions in1893, and Freud began encouraging all his medical patients touse the &quot;talking cure,&quot; saying, through free association,whatever popped into their minds while lying on a couch.   What he heard convinced Freud that he had located anentryway into the unconscious, and he set out to expand hisobservations into an all-encompassing theory. At the time,Freud was in his early 40s and desperate to make his mark inVienna. &quot;He was the oldest child of parents who doted on him,and he grew up expecting a lot from himself,&quot; says RoyGinsburg, a psychiatrist at Stanford University MedicalCenter in Palo Alto, Calif. &quot;Also, I'm sure being Jewish in alargely non-Jewish, apparently quite anti-Semitic societyspurred him on.&quot;   From what his patients were dredging up, Freud beganpiecing together the idea that a nervous disorder, a&quot;neurosis,&quot; resulted from the bottling-up of traumaticthoughts too painful to acknowledge.   &quot;That, to my mind, was his greatest achievement,&quot; saysRobert Berk, a psychoanalyst who teaches Freudian theory atthe Post-Graduate Center for Mental Health, a privatetraining institute in New York. &quot;The unconscious wassomething that had long been discussed, it was common coinfor philosophers and poets. But Freud identified theexistence of repression -- the fact that the human mind willforget, distort or deny real experiences in an effort todefend itself.&quot;   Says Mardi Horwitz, a research psychologist at Universityof California, Berkeley, who studies unconscious thinking:&quot;Freud's idea about repression was brilliant, and we now knowit was right. But what we're just finding is that theunconscious contains lots of things, such as memories andperceptions that aren't repressed. That's because the mindsimply can't consciously handle everything coming at it or itwould be flooded.&quot;   Indeed, what troubled Freud's contemporaries -- and stillriles many today -- was Freud's initial explanation that theunconscious was filled with repressed sexual wishes andfantasies that people experience when they are youngchildren.   &quot;It was an outrageous notion,&quot; Dr. Berk says. &quot;Childrenwere thought to be innocent, not sexual. Of course, we nowknow gratification of a sexual nature -- masturbating, forinstance -- begins very early in life and is very natural.&quot;   Freud's patients were mostly prim, upper-class folksliving in the Victorian era. Sexuality wasn't openlydiscussed; it was repressed. Critics argue that what Freudheard was an expression of the time and not universal in thehuman psyche.   Many of the women Freud treated, for instance, told him ofhaving been seduced by their father. Unable to accept thetales of incest, Freud decided the women only fantasized thesex. Later, he conceded that some women had been abused, butsaid either fantasy or reality could generate powerfulpsychic conflicts if locked away.   Freud buttressed the finding with still another remarkablefeat. He analyzed himself, digging like an archaeologist pastlayers of his own repressed memories. There he found that asa young child he had desired his mother. He was startled bythe memory of being aroused by seeing her naked. He alsorecalled feeling anger and hatred for his main competitor forhis mother's love, his father. This was the Oedipal complex,a notion that to this day can arouse near-violent reactionfrom people when, through therapy, they discover it in theirown lives.   &quot;Freud was unacceptable because he was unearthing forcesthat had been hidden forever precisely because they weretaboo,&quot; says Emmanuel Garcia, a psychoanalyst at theInstitute of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. &quot;The realquestion is not if the {Oedipal} urge exists, but how each ofus has dealt with it.&quot;   Even so, Freud's strength, say many of his supporters, washis willingness to modify his discoveries. Throughout thefirst decade of the new century, as he studied his patients,Freud expanded the list of unpalatable impulses beyond sexand aggression to include all sorts of beliefs, judgments,shame and guilt.   In 1899, with the publication of his book &quot;TheInterpretation of Dreams,&quot; Freud described exactly how therepressed impulses cause psychic damage. He found it bystudying his patients' dreams, which he called the &quot;royalroad to the unconscious.&quot; The dream book was tepidlyreceived, selling only several hundred copies. But later inlife, Freud called it his &quot;most significant work.&quot;   In it, Freud explained that dreams are distorted imagesthat result when repressed but powerful impulses -- themind's id -- surge toward consciousness only to be pushedback by the mind's protective defense system -- thesuper-ego, or conscience. This conflict, if never openlyidentified, can cause severe mental blocks -- neuroticbehavior such as the inability to form a lasting sexualrelationship, difficulty succeeding at work, unexplainedanxiety, even physical ills.   Joseph Weiss, a researcher at San Francisco PsychoanalyticInstitute, uses a modified version of the conflict theory ina new type of psychoanalysis. Dr. Weiss believes many peopleunconsciously yearn to resolve their conflicts so they cangain better control over their lives.   Dr. Weiss's technique, in which a therapist is moreactively involved than in Freud's original technique, isbased on the idea that the unconscious is filled with&quot;pathogenic beliefs,&quot; irrational but powerfully controllingideas that keep people from attaining desirable goals.   Even so, Dr. Weiss's view of his patient's problem is pureFreud. For it was Freud who explained why a young woman,ruled by a dominating father, would marry an abusive man. Thewoman, says Freud, is destined to repeat bad relationshipsuntil the original experience with her father is dredged upfrom her unconscious.   It is Freud that therapists, and even social commentators,rely on to understand why a successful investment banker, whogrew up feeling insecure, would commit fraud or trade oninside information. The behavior, which sabotages theapparent success, may be an effort to re-enact past feelings.Indeed, it is through Freudian detective work that theseemingly irrational in human behavior can be made clear andpoignant.   &quot;Freud's great contribution is his convincing claim thatwe are not completely the master of our own household,&quot; saysRobert Wallerstein, a Mill Valley, Calif., psychoanalyst andpast president of the International Psycho-AnalyticalAssociation. &quot;We are, Freud said, moved by forces of which weare unaware, residues of the past that deeply influence thepresent.&quot;   Dr. Weiss, and most psychotherapists, help patients get tothe source of the conflict by a powerful mental processcalled transference, which dazzled Freud when he stumbledonto it.   Freud encountered transference in treating a young womannamed Dora, who expressed an intense, irrational anger towardhim. Later, Freud realized that Dora's reaction wasreminiscent of her feelings toward her father and other men.It was &quot;a discovery destined to revolutionizepsychotherapeutic technique,&quot; says Peter Buckley, a New Yorktherapist.   Dora's anger caused her to terminate treatment beforeFreud could help her. But he later understood that throughtransference, the patient unconsciously begins to repeattroublesome behaviors from childhood with the therapist. Thetherapist's job, said Freud, was to carefully cultivatetransference so the patient could bring the original conflictto life and deal with it.   Most therapists today readily acknowledge the power oftransference. Keith Ablow, a resident in psychiatry, says hewas taken aback recently by a new client who told him intheir first session that he seemed like a &quot;low life.&quot; Dr.Ablow later learned that the woman had been abused by herfather, and that many of the men she gravitated toward wereabusive.   It is the power of this and other psychoanalytictechniques that gave Freud legitimacy by the 1920s. AfterWorld War I, Freud's therapy helped soldiers psychologicallydamaged by traumatic battle experiences. Soon, his vision ofthe unconscious pervaded European society.   In academic circles, the so-called Freudian world view --that one's history drives current action -- has been risingin popularity since then, and has surged in recent years.Today, many university scholars use the Freudian vision toteach critical thinking. At the University of Minnesota,Madelon Sprengnether says she teaches Shakespeare using&quot;psychoanalytic perspective as an interpretive tool.&quot;   Moreover, the understanding that experiences in infancyand early childhood can rebound through life has shaped ageneration of child-development experts, whose beliefs, inturn, have trickled down to parents, schools and day-careprograms.   Based in part on work by Freud's daughter, Anna, &quot;Nowthere's an emphasis on how the relationship between a parentand child illuminates healthy or deviant behavior later inlife,&quot; says psychoanalyst Arnold Solnit, director of YaleUniversity's Child Studies Center. &quot;Freud made us realizethat how one feels is as important in describing a humanexperience as are the facts of a person's life. Today, we paymuch closer attention to a child's feelings than even ageneration ago.&quot;   But if psychoanalysis as a philosophy is on the rise, itsusefulness as a medical tool remains clouded. Psychoanalysis-- free-association sessions several times a week --   exploded in the U.S. after World War II, but it began asharp decline by the 1960s as many psychiatrists becamefrustrated by their inability to treat severe mentalillnesses, such as manic-depression and schizophrenia.   Psychiatry then veered sharply toward a belief that muchof depression results from biochemical glitches in the brain.The evidence was that new medicines aimed at repairingdefective transmission of nerve signals between brain cellsrelieved depression.   The very recent popularity of the antidepressant drugProzac, sold by Eli Lilly andamp; Co., is swaying even staunchsupporters of Freud. Increasingly, mental-healthpractitioners believe that depression is a complex of biologyand psychology. There is some emerging evidence, however,that chronic neurosis can itself cause lasting biochemicalglitches. Thus, a compromise seems in the works.   &quot;These days, the thinking is that drugs can remove thepain of acute depression, but that therapy can help those whowant to get at the deeper cause,&quot; says Gerald Klerman, aresearch psychiatrist at Cornell University School ofMedicine.   Many scientists mapping the biology underlying humanthought criticize Freud's unsophisticated suggestions aboutthe brain's unconscious activities. In recent years, Harvardresearcher Allan Hobson has attacked Freud's dream theory.   Freud said the dream images result from repressedimpulses. But Dr. Hobson has shown that dream images are theresult of a natural and periodic firing of brain cells duringa certain segment of sleep. Dream stories are bizarre becausethe images are random.   &quot;I don't say these images don't have deeper meanings aboutourselves,&quot; Dr. Hobson says, &quot;but they don't necessarilyreflect a repressed idea seeking expression that only atrained psychoanalyst can decipher.&quot;   Psychoanalysts tell a story that suggests how Freud mighthave viewed the current criticism. One day, the story goes, acolleague, Sandor Firenczi, complained about the carping fromtheir contemporaries. Freud retorted: &quot;Don't worry so much,Sandor. Surely our opponents deride our theories by day, butthey dream according to them at night.&quot;   ---                  Philosopher of the Mind                                                                                                          Sigmund Freud's theory of the mind revolutionized people'sperception of themselves. His vision of the unconscious as adynamic reservoir of hidden memories, fantasies and pastexperiences that rule present behavior is the foundation formodern psychology, social analysis and efforts to map thebrain's workings.
