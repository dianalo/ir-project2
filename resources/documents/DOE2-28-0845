High order perturbationtheory is used for the calculation of the ionization cross sections ofboth the ground state and excited states. However, the above-thresholdionization is observed for more intensive fields. Disappearance of thefirst above-threshold ionization peaks with the laser field intensityincrease could be scarcely explained by the perturbation theory. Becausethere is no full coincidence between quantum-mechanical and classicalcalculations and it is not clear for what field frequencies and intensitiesthe classical mechanic is correct, the quasiclassical theory developmentis reasonable, and what is more, it is suitable for the description ofhighly excited atoms. The quasiclassical theory is convenient for analyticalsolution, but not for numerical calculations. Since the problem of electronmotion simultaneously in the Coulomb and oscillating electric fieldshas no exact analytical solution even in terms of the classical mechanics,some extra approximations in the quasiclassical theory should be usedtoo.</TEXT></DOC>
