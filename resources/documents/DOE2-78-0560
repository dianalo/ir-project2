Certain restrictions currently applyin Alberta which hinder eastern customers and western suppliers frommaking supply agreements; one is the disallowing of removal permits,which enable export of gas from Alberta, to those wishing to sell gasdirectly to residential, commercial, or small industrial customers; anotherrestriction is the limitation of removal permits to two years for limitedvolumes, unless the supplier can prove (possibly requiring a public hearing)that necessary reserves and pipeline capacity are available. Access totransportation is also limited, and controlled in a monopolistic fashion.The ramifications of these policies on the marketplace for natural gasis discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
