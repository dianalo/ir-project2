In a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia agreed with a lower court ruling last yearthat the Federal Salary Act is constitutional.   Members of Congress earn $89,500, although leaders in each houseearn slightly more.   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and five House Republicanschallenged the act's multistep procedure: establishment of a paystudy commission; the commission's recommendation to the president;a presidential decision setting the increase; and the chance forlawmakers to change the presidential ruling.   The lawmakers said the Constitution's intent was that Congressset its pay scale by passing a law, a politically risky system usedfrom the founding of the nation through enactment of the currentlaw in 1967.   The challenge also contended the act violated the constitutionalseparation of powers among the branches by delegatingdecision-making authority to the president in setting the pay.   The salary act determines pay increases not only for Congress,but also for judges and high-ranking executive branch officials.   Since the court threw out the challenge, it di not addresswhether a decision declaring the law unconstitutional would havewiped out salary increases for judges and administration officials.   The appellate court said the 1967 law is constitutional becauseit gives Congress the ultimate role of disapproving salaryrecommendations by the president.   The pay commission is established every four years, its membersappointed by all three branches. After the commission reports tothe president and the chief executive submits his figures toCongress, lawmakers have 30 days to disapprove the presidentialdecision. Otherwise, the president's figures take effect.   Referring to Congress' ability to change the president'srecommendations, the court said, ``Whatever the practicaldifficulties and political realities, Senator Humphrey and hisco-plaintiffs have readily at hand ... an `in-house' remedy. ...The availability of an internally available remedy to members ofCongress means that it would be an abuse of discretion for thejudiciary to entertain the action.''   In 1987, the commission recommended giving Congress a raise to$135,000. But President Reagan, citing the need to reduce thedeficit, recommended the $12,100 figure.   The opinion was written by U.S. Circuit Judge Kenneth H. Starr.Joining him were Circuit Judges Patricia Wald and Harry Edwards.   Challenging the law along with Humphrey were Robert Dornan,R-Calif.; Bob Smith, R-N.H.; Beau Boulter, R-Texas; Jack Davis,R-Ill.; and Clyde Holloway, R-La.</TEXT></DOC>
