Adelman, who was the Reaganadministration's arms control director, says the United Statesshould never negotiate a reduction in short-range nuclear missileswith the Soviet Union.   ``For two reasons,'' Adelman said Wednesday in an interview.``They have been an essential element in deterrence since the early1960s. No. 2, there is no way to verify whether the missiles willhave nuclear or conventional or chemical munitions.''   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has demanded that the UnitedStates negotiate reductions in the missiles with the Soviet Union.Kohl is also resisting U.S. and British efforts to more than triplethe range of NATO's Lance missiles to about 250 miles.   But Bush on Wednesday ruled out negotiations with the Soviets onshort-range nuclear missiles. The White House put the best face onthe dispute by calling it a sign of NATO's vitality.   Adelman, who was the U.S. arms control director from 1983 to1987, said the Bush administration should propose to Kohl that themissiles be modernized and then the U.S. arsenal of short-rangeweapons could be reduced by about 1,000 from its current level of4,500.   But Adelman, who was an enthusiastic supporter of the 1987treaty to ban U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles,said the United States should never negotiate to reduce or _another Kohl goal _ to eliminate the Lances.   ``Never,'' Adelman said. ``Never under any circumstance. It isunwise and it's unverifiable.''   He said the United States would comply with a ban on short-rangemissiles. But, Adelman said, ``we don't always know if the Sovietswould comply'' and it is impossible to distinguish between nuclearand non-nuclear tactical missiles.   Paul H. Nitze, a senior adviser on arms control in the Reaganadministration, told The New York Times this week that PresidentBush was making a mistake in refusing to open talks with theSoviets on short-range nuclear missiles.   Nitze said such negotiations would provide an opportunity toeliminate a large Soviet advantage.   Adelman said he disagreed, but added ``there is nothing wrong inhis speaking out'' on the subject.   Since leaving his post Adelman has been writing, teaching andserving as vice president of the Institute for ContemporaryStudies, a public policy research group in San Francisco.   With Bush's summit meeting with 15 allied leaders looming atmonth's end, efforts by Norway and Canada to broker a compromisedid not meet with immediate success. Through his spokesman, MarlinFitzwater, the president insisted the Lance missiles must beupgraded to deter Soviet attack.   Bush told visiting Norwegian Prime Minister Gro HarlemBrundtland that ``entering into arms control negotiations onshort-range nuclear forces with the Soviet Union would be amistake,'' Fitzwater said.   After a one-hour session in the Oval Office, Mrs. Brundtlandstressed a need to find ``common ground'' with Kohl.   Canada, meanwhile, approached NATO members with a compromisethat called for negotiations with the Soviets on short-rangenuclear weapons with the understanding all Lances would not beuprooted and the Warsaw Pact's edge in conventional forces would beerased. The deal would permit modernizing the missiles first.   Mrs. Brundtland told reporters in a White House driveway that asolution would be found before the May 29-30 summit or at leastwhen the leaders are gathered in Brussels.   But Fitzwater was dubious. ``We will continue to discuss it,''he said of the missile dispute, ``but we are very firm in ourposition.''   On Capitol Hill, members of Congress warned that the UnitedStates might reconsider keeping troops in Europe if West Germanypersisted in pushing for removal of the Lances.   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee told DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney they had serious concerns about the WestGerman position.   ``I think if the West German people have come to the conclusionthey can place more faith and reliance on Mr. Gorbachev's words andassurances than they can upon sound NATO strategy, than it would bevery difficult for me to continue to commit the size of the forceswe have in Europe under those circumstances,'' said Sen. WilliamCohen, R-Maine.   Another Republican, Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, said thatif the missiles were eliminated and the 324,000 U.S. militarypersonnel in Germany were placed at risk, the administration'spolicy should be ``that a substantial percentage of troops bebrought home and we allow West Germany greater responsibility oftheir defense.''   Cheney, who had come to Capitol Hill to discuss the fiscal 1990defense budget, cautioned against ``overdramatizing the nature ofthe current differences'' within NATO.   But Cheney said that if a NATO consensus called for noshort-range missiles, ``I as secretary of defense would havesomething of a stomach ache.''</TEXT></DOC>
