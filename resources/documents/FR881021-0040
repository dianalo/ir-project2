Thisproposal is based on observations made in the field and on scientific dataindicating that the Florida nursery strains are extremely unlikely to infectmature citrus trees and fruit in groves or to damage fruit. This actionwould remove requirements that appear to exceed what is needed to preventthe interstate spread of the form of citrus canker caused by the Floridanursery strains;(2) By allowing calamondin and kumquat plants grown from seeds or rootedcuttings in nurseries or groves outside the area of Florida where therehave been primary infestations of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strainsto be moved interstate under less stringent conditions than at presentand to all areas of the United States except commercial citrus-producingareas. This proposal would relieve what appear to be unnecessary restrictionson the interstate movement of plants that are highly resistant to citruscanker;(3) By prohibiting the interstate movement from Florida of budded or graftedcalamondin and kumquat plants, which may have been grown from rootstocksof plants susceptible to and capable of transmitting citrus canker. Thisproposal appears necessary to prevent the interstate spread of this disease;(4) By adding the species <T3>Clausena lansium</T3> (Lour.) Skeels (common name, wampi) to the listof articles regulated because of citrus canker, thereby prohibiting theinterstate movement of these plants from Florida. This proposal appearsnecessary to prevent the interstate spread of citrus canker because wampiplants in Florida have been found infected with the form of citrus cankercaused by the Florida nursery strains;(5) By reducing the area of Florida that is under special restriction becauseof citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Consideration will be given only to written comments postmarkedor received on or before November 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send an original and three copies of written commentsto Regulatory Coordination, APHIS, USDA, Room 728 Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Rd., Hyattsville, MD 20782.

Elder, Chief OperationsOfficer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, PPQ, APHIS, USDA, Room 661,Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, 301-436-6365.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Citrus canker is a plant disease caused by strains of the bacterium <T3>Xanthomonas campestris</T3> pv. <T3>citri</T3> (Hasse) Dye. The disease is known to affect plants and plantparts, including fruit, of citrus and citrus relatives (Family Rutaceae).It can cause defoliation and other serious damage to the leaves and twigsof susceptible plants. It may also make the fruit of infected plants unmarketableby causing lesions on the fruit. Infected fruit may also drop from treesbefore reaching maturity. Aggressive strains of <T3>Xanthomonas campestris</T3> pv. <T3>citri</T3> can infect susceptible plants rapidly and lead to extensiveeconomic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) established thecitrus canker regulations (contained in 7 CFR 301.75 and referred to belowas the regulations) in 1984 after plants at several central Florida citrusnurseries were found to be infected with previously undescribed strainsof <T3>Xanthomonas campestris</T3> pv. <T3>citri</T3>. These strains have come to be known as the Florida nurserystrains. Because little was known about these strains at that time, andbecause some strains of <T3>Xanthomonas campestris</T3> pv. <T3>citri</T3> are known to cause a very serious plant disease, the regulationsplaced severe constraints on the interstate movement of potential hostmaterial from Florida. Later, when trees infected with the Asiatic strainsof <T3>Xanthomonas campestris</T3> pv. <T3>citri</T3> were detected on citrus trees on residential propertiesand in a commercial grove near Bradenton, in Manatee County, Florida, thesame regulations applied.Over time, both research and observations made in the field yielded datasuggesting that there were important differences between the Florida nurserystrains and the Asiatic strains of <T3>Xanthomonas campestris </T3>pv. <T3>citri </T3>and the diseases caused by these strains.These differenceswere summarized as follows in a final rule published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 11, 1988 (53 FR 3999-4006, DocketNo. 88-001):<ITAG tagnum="21">The Florida nursery strains of the bacterium <T3>Xanthomonas Campestris </T3>pv. <T3>citri </T3>are associated primarily with outbreaks of citrus cankerin plant nurseries. They have been found only in Florida. Current informationsuggests that this form of citrus canker is pathogenetically and geneticallydifferent from the disease caused by Asiatic strains of citrus canker,and never has been found on fruit in a commercial grove.</ITAG>Because of these differences, we amended the regulations, by the finalrule cited above, to reduce restrictions on the interstate movement offruit from all areas of Florida except the area where there have been primaryinfestations of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains.At the same time, recognizing that many questions about the Florida nurserystrains remained unanswered, APHIS invited a blue-ribbon panel of plantpathologists to review all of the research pertaining to the Florida nurserystrains and to consider specific questions concerning the taxonomy andbiology of these strains. The panel met last March in Gainesville, Florida,and delivered its report to APHIS in April. The report was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 28, 1988 (53 FR 24296-24298, Docket No.88-100) as part of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that solicitedpublic comment on whether and how, as a result of the panel's report, weshould revise the regulations. Following are the options we asked the publicto consider:1. Reduce the quarantined area in Florida to include only that area wherewithin the past 2 years, there have been infestations of citrus cankercaused by the Asiatic strains.2. Reduce the restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articlesfrom all areas of Florida except that area where, within the past 2 years,there have been infestations of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains.3. Maintain the current regulations.We received 34 comments concerning these options from individual growers,nursery owners, grower and packing associations, other representativesof the citrus industry, and state government officials in Arizona, California,Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. Nine commenters supported Option 1; 14 supportedOption 2; and 11 supported Option 3.Based on the report by the blue-ribbon panel and a review of the currentcitrus canker eradication program, and after considering all the commentswe received concerning the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, we areproposing to revise the regulations in line with Option 2. We do not supportOption 1 because we know that the Florida nursery strains can, in somecases, seriously damage nursery plants, and because we believe that furtherresearch may be necessary to finally resolve the question of whether theFlorida nursery strains can infect and damage mature trees and fruit incommercial groves. Nonetheless, we believe the current regulations, designedto prevent the spread of virulent forms of citrus canker such as that causedby the Asiatic strains, go beyond what is necessary to prevent the spreadof the form of citrus canker caused by the Florida nursery strains. Fouryears after the form of citrus canker caused by the Florida nursery strainswas first detected in Florida, we still have not found it in commercialgroves, except in three instances where infected transplants had been movedto groves from infested nurseries. (In two of these instances, there wasno evidence that the disease had spread from these plants to other plantsin the grove. In the third case, the grove was not well maintained, andinspection revealed some local spread to sprouts from Swingle rootstock.In none of these instances was infected fruit found, and, after the infectedplants were removed, no additional infections were observed.) Researchand observations made in the field over the last four years suggest thatthe Florida nursery strains cause a form of citrus canker disease thatis different from and less serious than the form of citrus canker diseasecaused by the Asiatic strains. Option 2 would continue to provide protectionagainst the interstate spread of the form of citrus canker caused by theFlorida nursery strains while relieving what appear to be unnecessary burdenson those involved in the interstate movement of regulated articles.Specific proposed changes to the regulations are discussed below.Certificates for Interstate Movement of Regulated Fruit<ITAG tagnum="81">Current Requirements</ITAG>Regulated fruit from any area of Florida where a primary infestation causedby Asiatic strains has occurred is not eligible for interstate movementwith a certificate until 2 years after the last infested plant in the areahas been destroyed. Regulated fruit produced in other areas of Floridamay be moved interstate with a certificate to any area of the United States,including commercial citrus-producing areas, if the following conditionsare met:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The fruit is harvested from a grove of 10 or more regulated trees;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The grove producing the fruit has not contained any infested orexposed plants or plant parts within the past 2 years; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The grove producing the fruit has been found free of citrus cankeron two surveys, which must be conducted as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Between one year and 90 days before harvest begins, an inspectormust: examine all trees on the perimeter of the grove while driving bythe trees at a speed of not more than 2 m.p.h.; examine, while on foot,at least 12 trees in high-risk areas of the grove (such as the grove entrance,the perimeter of the grove, and areas where the movement of people andequipment is concentrated); and examine, while on foot, a minimum of fourmature trees or eight young trees in one randomly selected location inevery 10 acres of the grove, or, if the grove is less than 10 acres, examine,while on foot, a minimum of four mature trees or eight young trees in onerandomly selected location; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) No more than 90 days before harvest begins, an inspector mustwalk through the grove and examine: all trees on either side of the firstmiddle (between the first two rows) and every fourth middle thereafterthroughout the grove; and at least 12 trees in high-risk areas of the grove(such as the grove entrance, the perimeter of the grove, and areas wherethe movement of people and equipment is concentrated); and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) At least one of the two surveys must be conducted between 4to 12 weeks after a period of high temperatures and frequent rainfall likelyto cause a flush of growth on the trees to be inspected;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) The grove producing the fruit is at least one-half mile from anyproperty that has contained infested or exposed plants or plant parts duringthe past 2 years;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Within one-half to 5 miles of the grove producing the fruit, thefollowing plants have been destroyed:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) All infested plants; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Any exposed plants at high risk for developing citrus canker.Identification of plants at high risk for developing citrus canker willbe based on an evaluation all of the circumstances related to their exposure,including, but not limited to, the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) The stage of maturity of the exposed plants at the time of exposure;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) The size and degree of infestation to which the plants were exposed;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) The proximity of the exposed plants to the infested plants atthe time of exposures; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) The length of time the plants were exposed to the infestation;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(E) The strain of the bacterium to which the plants were exposed;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) During the past 2 years, any shipments of regulated plants receivedby the grove producing the fruit have come only from nurseries found freeof citrus canker on three surveys conducted by an inspector approximately30 days apart and not more than 90 days before each shipment, and everyregulated plant in the nursery must be examined on each survey. In addition,all regulated plants at all nurseries in Florida that contain regulatedplants must be examined by an inspector approximately every 30 days;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Properties within 5 miles of the grove producing the fruit weresurveyed and found free of citrus canker by an inspector at least one timeduring the past year as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) All properties that contain 10 or more regulated plants and thatare within 5 milies of the grove; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) All properties that contain one to nine regulated plants andthat are within one-half mile of the grove; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Twenty percent of the properties that contain one to nine regulatedplants and that are within one-half to 5 miles of the grove. The 20-percentsample must be distributed as evenly as possible over the area, with differentsamples inspected each year in a 5-year inspection cycle;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) All personnel, vehicles, and equipment are treated in accordancewith andSection; 301.75-12 (c) and (d) of this subpart upon entering thegrove producing the fruit; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(9) The identity of the fruit is maintained during picking, haulingto the packing house, and packing;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(10) The fruit is treated in accordance with andSection; 301.75-12(a)of this subpart and then waxed; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(11) The fruit is free of leaves, twigs, and other plant litter, exceptstems less than one-inch long that are attached to the fruit; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(12) The fruit is packed in containers marked with a United StatesDepartment of Agriculture stamp that says ``Certified under all applicableFederal or State cooperative domestic plant quarantines''; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(13) The fruit is to be moved under any additional emergency conditionsthat may be imposed by the Administrator under the Federal Plant Pest Actto prevent the spread of citrus canker; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(14) The fruit is eligible for movement under all other federal domesticplant quarantines and regulations applicable to the fruit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Changes</ITAG>We propose to continue to require that properties surrounding a producinggrove be free from the form of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains,but not necessarily from the form of citrus canker caused by the Floridanursery strains. Thus, the grove producing the fruit must be at least one-halfmile from any property that has contained plants or plant parts duringthe past 2 years that were infested with or exposed to the Asiatic strains;and, within one-half to 5 miles of the grove producing the fruit, all plantsinfested with the Asiatic strains and all exposed plants at high risk fordeveloping the form of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains musthave been destroyed. These requirements provide additional assurance thatfruit moved interstate with a certificate have not been exposed to theAsiatic strains, which can infect mature trees and fruit and lead to extensiveeconomic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas.However, because we have never found a primary infestation caused by theFlorida nursery strains in any commercial grove, similar requirements donot appear necessary to prevent the interstate spread of the form of citruscanker caused by the Florida nursery strains. If the grove producing fruitfor interstate movement with a certificate has not contained any plantsor plant parts during the past 2 years that were infested with or exposedto the Florida nursery strains, and if the grove has been adequately surveyedand found free of this disease, it is highly unlikely that fruit producedin the grove would be infested with the Florida nursery strains. The presenceon surrounding properties of plants or plant parts infested with or exposedto the Florida nursery strains could result, at most, in possible surfacecontamination of the fruit. Treating and waxing of the fruit would renderthese surface bacteria incapable of infecting susceptible plants. Therefore,we propose to remove the requirement that properties surrounding a producinggrove be free from the form of citrus canker caused by the Florida nurserystrains.To clarify that groves producing fruit for interstate movement with a certificatemust continue to be free of all strains of the bacterium that causes citruscanker, we propose to specify ``citrus canker (caused by any strain)''in applicable provisions. Thus, the grove producing the fruit must nothave contained any plants or plant parts, during the past 2 years, thatwere infested with or exposed to citrus canker (caused by any strain);the grove producing the fruit must have been found free of citrus canker(caused by any strain) on two surveys; and during the past 2 years, anyshipments of regulated plants received by the grove producing the fruitmust have come only from nurseries found free of citrus canker (causedby any strain) on the specified surveys.We also propose to discontinue requiring surveys of properties within 5miles of a producing grove. Records kept by grove owners and nursery ownershave provided satisfactory information on the location of exposed and potentiallyinfested plants. These records would allow inspectors to determine whetherproperties within 5 miles of a producing grove meet our requirements.In addition, we propose to change the procedure for the first grove surveyby requiring that it be conducted between May 1 and December 31, inclusive,during the year before harvest and not less than 90 days before harvestbegins. The period between May 1 and December 31, inclusive, is the mostlikely time of year for outdoor plants to express symptoms of citrus canker.Furthermore, because weather conditions by this time of year would haveproduced at least one flush of growth on the trees to be inspected, itdoes not appear necessary to retain the separate requirement that eitherthe first or second grove survey must be conducted 4-12 weeks after weatherlikely to cause a flush of growth on the trees. Therefore, we propose toremove this requirement.The prescribed surveys are the minimum level of inspection that must bedone; more intensive surveys would be acceptable.Finally, we propose to discontinue requiring the treatment of personnel,vehicles, and equipment entering the grove. This requirement does not appearto be necessary outside the area of Florida where primary infestationscaused by the Asiatic strains have occurred within the past 2 years. Althoughwe know that the Asiatic strains are capable of being spread by personnel,vehicles, and equipment entering a grove after being on a property infestedwith this form of citrus canker, there is no evidence that bacteria ofthe Florida nursery strains are spread in this manner. Moreover, thereare no groves or residential properties known to be infested with bacteriaof the Florida nursery strains.Other requirements pertaining to the interstate movement of regulated fruitwith a certificate would remain the same.Limited Permits for the Interstate Movement of Regulated Fruit<ITAG tagnum="81">Current Requirements</ITAG>At present, regulated fruit may be moved interstate with a limited permit,from any area of Florida, to any area of the United States, <T3>except </T3>commercial citrus-producing areas, if the following conditionsare met:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The grove producing the fruit has not contained any infested plantsor plant parts within the past year;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) In the grove producing the fruit, any exposed plants at high riskfor developing citrus canker have been destroyed. Identification of plantsat high risk for developing citrus canker will be based on an evaluationof all the circumstances related to their exposure, including, but notlimited to, the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) The stage of maturity of the exposed plants at the time of exposure;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The size and degree of infestation to which the plants were exposed;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The proximity of the exposed plants to the infested plants atthe time of exposure;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) The length of time the plants were exposed to the infestation;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) The strain of the bacterium to which the plants were exposed;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The grove producing the fruit has been found free of citrus cankeron surveys, which must be conducted as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) For groves of 10 or more regulated trees, an inspector must:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>A</T3>) Between one year and 90 days before harvest begins: examineall trees on the perimeter of the grove while driving by the trees at aspeed of not more than 2 m.p.h.; examine, while on foot, at least 12 treesin high-risk areas of the grove (such as the grove entrance, the perimeterof the grove, and areas where the movement of people and equipment is concentrated);and examine, while on foot, a minimum of four mature trees or eight youngtrees in one randomly selected location in every 10 acres of the grove,or, if the grove is less than 10 acres, examine, while on foot, a minimumof four mature trees or eight young trees in one randomly selected location;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>B</T3>) No more than 90 days before harvest begins: Examine all treesin the outer two rows of the grove while driving by the trees at a speedof not more than 2 m.p.h.; examine, while on foot, at least 12 trees inhigh-risk areas of the grove (such as the grove entrance, the perimeterof the grove, and areas where the movement of people and equipment is concentrated);and examine, while on foot, a minimum of four mature trees or eight youngtrees in each of two randomly selected locations in every 10 acres of thegrove, or, if the grove is less than 10 acres, examine, while on foot,a minimum of four mature trees or eight young trees in each of two randomlyselected locations:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>C</T3>) At least one of the two surveys must be conducted 4 to 12 weeksafter a period of high temperatures and frequent rainfall likely to causea flush of growth on the trees to be inspected;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) For groves of fewer than 10 regulated trees, an inspector mustwalk through the grove and examine every tree no more than 30 days beforethe beginning of harvest;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) The fruit is treated in accordance with andSection; 301.75-12(a)of this subpart;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) The fruit is free of leaves, twigs, and other plant litter, exceptstems less than one-inch long that are attached to the fruit;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) The fruit is to be moved under any additional emergency conditionsthat may be imposed by the Administrator under the Federal Plant Pest Actto prevent the spread of citrus canker; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) The fruit is eligible for movement under all other federal domesticplant quarantines and regulations applicable to the fruit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) Determines that fruit harvested from a grove of fewer than 10trees is to be moved interstate directly to a household, with the intentthat the fruit be consumed at, or by members of, that household.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Changes</ITAG>To clarify that groves producing fruit for interstate movement with a limitedpermit must continue to be free of all strains of the bacterium that causescitrus canker, we propose to specify ``citrus canker (caused by any strain)''in applicable provisions. Thus, during the past 1 year, the grove producingthe fruit must not have contained any plants or plant parts that were infestedwith citrus canker (caused by any strain); all exposed plants in the grovethat are at high risk for development citrus canker (caused by any strain)must have been destroyed; and the grove producing the fruit must have beensurveyed and found free of citrus canker (caused by any strain).For groves of 10 or more regulated trees, we propose to add a requirementthat, during the past 1 year, any shipments of regulated plants receivedby the grove producing the fruit must have come only from nurseries foundfree of citrus canker (caused by any strain). The nurseries would haveto be found free of citrus canker on three surveys conducted by an inspectorapproximately 30 days apart and not more than 90 days before each shipment.Every regulated plant in the nursery would have to be examined on eachsurvey. This requirement, which already applies to groves producing fruitfor interstate movement with a certificate, would help ensure that grovesproducing fruit for interstate movement with a limited permit are keptfree of plants that may be infested with or exposed to citrus canker.We propose to require only one survey of a grove of 10 or more regulatedtrees if the grove is outside the area of Florida where primary infestationscaused by the Asiatic strains have occurred. The survey would have to beconducted in the manner now prescribed for the initial grove survey andbetween May 1 and December 1, inclusive, during the year before harvest.This period is the most likely time of year for outdoor plants to expresssymptoms of citrus canker. Furthermore, because weather conditions by thistime of year would have produced at least one flush of growth on the treesto be inspected, it does not appear necessary to retain the separate requirementthat the grove must be surveyed at least once within 4-12 weeks after weatherlikely to cause a flush of growth on the trees. Therefore, we propose toremove this requirement. If a grove is outside the area of Florida whereprimary infestations caused by the Asiatic strains have occurred, is foundfree of citrus canker on the single survey proposed, and meets the otherrequirements pertaining to groves, it is very unlikely to yield fruit thatwould present a risk of spreading citrus canker interstate.We propose to continue to require two surveys of a grove of 10 or moretrees if the grove is located within the area of Florida where a primaryinfestation caused by the Asiatic strains has occurred. However, we proposeto require that the first survey be conducted between May 1 and December31, inclusive, during the year before harvest and not less than 90 daysbefore harvest begins. We would continue to require that the second surveybe conducted no more than 90 days before harvest begins. Survey proceduresin each case would remain unchanged. As explained above, the proposal toconduct the first survey between May 1 and December 31, inclusive, ratherthan between 1 year and 90 days before harvest begins, is based on thistime of year being most favorable for detection of citrus canker. Again,and for the reasons given above, we propose to remove the requirement thatat least one of the two surveys be conducted within 4-12 weeks after weatherlikely to cause a flush of growth on the trees.  The prescribed surveys are the minimum level of inspection that must bedone; more intensive surveys would be acceptable.  In addition, we propose to prohibit the interstate movement of regulatedfruit produced in groves that are within one-half mile of any propertywhere a primary infestation caused by the Asiatic strains has occurredwithin the past 2 years. This prohibition would apply to any size grove.Practically, however, it would affect only those groves within the areaof Florida where there have been primary infestations caused by the Asiaticstrains, since groves outside this area are more than one-half mile fromany property where a primary infestation caused by the Asiatic strainshas occurred. This prohibition appears necessary to prevent the interstatespread of citrus canker.  We propose to allow fruit produced in a grove of 10 or more regulated treesto be treated with soap and water rather than with chlorine or sodium o-phenylphenate (SOPP) if the grove is outside the area of Florida where primaryinfestations caused by the Asiatic strains have occurred. Specifically,this fruit would have to be thoroughly wetted and brush scrubbed for oneminute in a solution of water and soap, or water and detergent, sufficientto cause a visible foaming action. This treatment would be effective inreducing surface bacteria, if any were present on the fruit, to the extentthat the fruit would present a negligible risk of spreading citrus cankerif moved interstate to parts of the United States that are not commercialcitrus-producing areas. Fruit produced in the area of Florida where therehas been a primary infestation caused by the Asiatic strains would notbe eligible for interstate movement unless treated with chlorine or SOPP. We propose to stop requiring treatment of fruit produced in groves of fewerthan 10 trees if the grove is outside the area of Florida where a primaryinfestation caused by the Asiatic strains has occurred. These groves mustbe inspected, tree by tree, within 30 days of harvest. With only a fewtrees being individually examined, inspectors are able to look at the fruititself, the actual commodity to be shipped. Fruit found free of citruscanker on this survey could, at most, have only very low levels of bacteriaon its surface. Most growers with groves of fewer than 10 trees wash fruitbefore shipping it, which would make the bacteria count even lower. Evenwithout the washing, however, any surface bacteria present would not belikely to survive long. Given that this fruit may not be sold in commercialchannels, but must be moved interstate directly to a household, there wouldbe almost no risk of the fruit spreading citrus canker interstate.  Treatment with chlorine or SOPP would continue to be required for fruitproduced in groves within the area of Florida where a primary infestationcaused by the Asiatic strains has occurred.  Also, we propose to require all personnel, vehicles, and equipment to betreated upon entering any grove of 10 or more regulated trees within thearea of Florida where there has been a primary infestation caused by theAsiatic strains. Several infestations caused by the Asiatic strains havebeen traced to contaminated vehicles and equipment, and the form of citruscanker caused by these strains can be spread by people who have handledcontaminated material. Therefore, we believe this requirement is necessaryto prevent new infestations of citrus canker caused by Asiatic strains. Other requirements pertaining to the interstate movement of fruit witha limited permit would remain the same.  Fruit Treatments  We have already discussed our proposal to allow an alternative treatmentfor certain fruit. (See the discussion under ``Limited Permits for theInterstate Movement of Regulated Fruit''.)  We also propose to specify that the 200 ppm chlorine solution prescribedas a treatment for fruit, seed, and vehicles and equipment is a 200 ppmsolution of sodium hypochlorite. Sodium hypochlorite is the active ingredientin the chlorine solution labeled for this use.  In addition, we propose to require that fruit treatments be applied eitherat a facility owned by a person operating under a compliance agreementwith Plant Protection and Quarantine or in the presence of an inspector.This requirement is necessary to ensure that fruit is treated as requiredbefore being moved interstate.  Limited Permits for Interstate Movement of Calamondin and Kumquat Plants We propose to relieve some restrictions on the interstate movement of certaincalamondin and kumquat plants from Florida and to impose other restrictions. When the regulations were established in 1984, they did not allow the interstatemovement of plants from Florida, except with a permit for scientific orexperimental purposes.  In March 1987, however, based on research and field observations showingcalamondin and kumquat plants to be highly resistant to citrus canker,we amended the regulations (52 FR 7562-7564, Docket No. 86-361) to allowthe interstate movement of these plants, under certain conditions, to areasof the United States that are not commercial citrus-producing areas.  The regulations distinguish between calamondin and kumquat plants thatare ``greenhouse-grown'' and those that are ``container-grown.'' UnderandSection; 301.75-7(f), ``greenhouse-grown'' calamondin nursery plants thatare individually sealed in plastic bags before leaving the nursery maybe moved interstate with a limited permit to all areas of the United Statesexcept American Samoa, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Puerto Rico,Texas, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Under andSection; 301.75-7(g),``container-grown'' calamondin and kumquat nursery plants may be movedinterstate with a limited permit only to that area of the United Stateseast of the Mississippi River and north of an imaginary line formed bythe southernmost borders of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, andNew Jersey.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Changes  </ITAG>(1) We propose to eliminate the distinction between ``greenhouse-grown''and ``container-grown'' plants and to allow all calamondin and kumquatplants that have been grown entirely from seeds or cuttings to be movedinterstate to all areas of the United States except commercial citrus-producingareas. These calamondin and kumquat plants would be referred to as ``own-root-only''plants.In the current regulations, ``greenhouse-grown'' calamondin plants referto calamondin plants that are grown in sterile medium on raised benchesin greenhouses. These are own-root-only plants. ``Container-grown'' calamondinand kumquat plants are plants that are grown outdoors and that may be own-root-onlyor budded or grafted to other varieties of rootstock. The different rulesfor greenhouse-grown and container-grown plants were established as anadded precaution against the spread of citrus canker, based on the premisethat measures to control and monitor citrus canker are less effective inopen fields than in greenhouses. However, research and observations madein the field since these rules were established have confirmed that allown-root-only calamondin and kumquat plants, including field-grown plants,are highly resistant to citrus canker. (For further information, contactDomestic and Emergency Operations, PPQ, APHIS, USDA, Room 661, FederalBuilding, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.)(2) As noted above, calamondin and kumquat plants may be budded or graftedonto other varieties of rootstock. Because the rootstock may be a varietysusceptible to citrus canker, and because it is impossible to determinevisually what type of rootstock has been used, we propose to prohibit theinterstate movement from quarantined areas of calamondin or kumquat plantsthat have been budded or grafted, regardless of the variety of rootstock.(3) We propose to clarify our requirements concerning attached fruit byspecifying that calamondin and kumquat plants may be moved interstate withor without fruit attached.Calamondin and kumquat plants with attached fruit are no more susceptibleto citrus canker than calamondin and kumquat plants without fruit. Therefore,any calamondin or kumquat plants that otherwise qualify for interstatemovement under our regulations would present an extremely remote chanceof spreading citrus canker through infected fruit. The current provisionstating that ``greenhouse-grown'' calamondin plants ``will have no fruitattached'' is intended to ensure that plants moved interstate as ``individuallypackaged calamondin nursery plants'' are the small, immature plants thatcurrent andSection; 301.75-7(f) is intended to cover. There is no similarrestriction for container-grown calamondin or kumquat nursery plants, whichare valued as ornamentals because of their fruit. Under our proposal, plantswith or without attached fruit would be handled in the same manner, andattached fruit would require no special handling or treatment beyond thatrequired for the plants.(4) We propose to remove the requirement that calamondin and kumquat plantsmust come from a nursery that has had no citrumelo or <T3>Poncirus trifoliata </T3>plants since May 1, 1985. This requirementwas established in March 1987 as a safeguard against the spread of theform of citrus canker caused by the Florida nursery strains. At that time,we thought that citrumelo and <T3>Poncirus trifoliata </T3>were much more susceptible than other plantsto infection by the Florida nursery strains, and that keeping citrumeloand <T3>Poncirus trifoliata </T3>out of nurseries was essential to preventingthe spread of citrus canker. Since then, we have determined through researchand observations made in the field that many other plants are as susceptible.However, we have found that, in nurseries where susceptible plants aregrown, we have been able to detect citrus canker, when it was present,within 90 days and at very low levels_only a few plants out of tens ofthousands, sometimes millions. Thus, it does not appear that allowing citrumeloand <T3>Poncirus trifoliata </T3>to be grown in nurseries with calamondin andkumquat plants would present any additional risk of spreading citrus cankerinterstate.(5) We propose to allow cuttings for propagation to be taken from plantslocated either: (a) On the same premises; or (b) on another premises underthe same ownership; or (c) at a nursery owned by another person operatingunder a compliance ageement in accordance with the regulations.The regulations currently require that cuttings be taken only from plantslocated on the same premises. This requirement ensures that we can locatepotential sources of infection if citrus canker is detected either on thecutting or on the plant from which it was taken. However, we have determinedthat tracing could also be accomplished if cuttings are taken from plantslocated on another property under the same ownership.In order to qualify for interstate movement with a limited permit, calamondinand kumquat plants must come from nurseries that have not received materialfrom properties infested with or exposed to citrus canker. One of the primaryways we determine whether a nursery meets this condition is by reviewingrecords that the State of Florida requires nurseries to keep on the movementof plants and plant material to and from nurseries and on the locationof plants within nurseries. When adequately maintained, these records wouldallow us to trace potential sources of infection, if necessary, even ifcuttings were moved to a nursery from another property owned by the sameperson. We believe, therefore, that in nurseries where calamondin and kumquatplants otherwise qualify for interstate movement with a limited permit,we would have adequate means of tracing potential sources of infection,if necessary, even if cuttings were moved to the nursery from another propertyowned by the same person.Nursery owners sometimes wish to move cuttings to their nursery from anursery owned by someone else. If the nursery from which the cuttings weretaken also met our requirements for moving calamondin and kumquat plantsinterstate with a limited permit, the cuttings would present an extremelyremote risk of causing the interstate spread of citrus canker. Nurseriesowned by persons operating under a compliance agreement with us in accordancewith andSection; 301.75-8 have agreed to comply with our regulations. Noncompliancewould result in cancellation of the compliance agreement. Therefore, webelieve that nurseries producing calamondin and kumquat plants for interstatemovement may receive cuttings from another nursery owned by a person operatingunder a compliance agreement with us without increasing the risk of thecalamondin and kumquat plants causing the interstate spread of citurs canker.(6) We propose to require that, within the past 2 years, nurseries wherethe plants are grown must not have contained any plants or plant partsinfested with or exposed to citrus canker (caused by any strain). Currently,the regulations state that nurseries must not have received any exposedmaterial from any infested or exposed property. Because no time periodis specified, this restriction applies to nurseries that may have receivedexposed material at any time in the past. In light of the comprehensiveand successful nursery inspection program in Florida, we believe this restrictioncan be eased.The regulations already require nurseries where regulated plants, includingcalamondin or kumquat plants, are grown to have three negative inspectionsfor citrus canker. The inspections must be conducted at approximately 30-dayintervals and not more than 90 days before the plants may be shipped interstate.These surveys have been conducted since 1984 at all nurseries in Floridathat contain regulated plants. Our experience has been that, when citruscanker has been present in a nursery, inspectors have found the diseaseby the third survey, that is, within 90 days. We have found this to bean adequate inspection safeguard in connection with our requirements concerningthe interstate movement of regulated fruit. Nursery plants, however, maypresent somewhat more risk than fruit of spreading citrus canker. Therefore,to remove even the slightest chance that exposed or infested calamondinor kumquat plants could be moved interstate, we propose to require nurserieswhere these plants are grown to be free of plants or plant parts infestedwith or exposed to citrus canker (caused by any strain) for at least 2years before the plants may be moved interstate. We chose 2 years becausethis is generally considered to be the time during which citrus cankermay remain dormant.In addition to specifying 2 years, our proposal changes the word ``received''to ``contained'' to cover any infestations that originate in a nursery.Also, the proposal requires that the nursery must not have contained any``infested,'' as well as ``exposed'' plants or plant parts. The term ``infested''was inadvertently omitted from the current regulations.(7) The regulations require calamondin and kumquat plants moved interstateto display a waterproof, boldface-type statement that the plants are notfor distribution in certain areas of the United States, which are commercialcitrus-producing areas.We propose to require that the list of commercial citrus-producing areasshown on the statement include Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, aswell as American Samoa, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Louisiana, PuertoRico, Texas, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. In accordancewith the restrictions on moving regulated articles interstate with a limitedpermit, calamondin and kumquat plants are prohibited in all commercialcitrus-producing areas of the United States. These areas are listed inandSection;301.75-4 of the regulations, and include Guam and the NorthernMariana Islands. These two areas were inadvertently omitted from the currentlist of areas required on the waterproof, boldface-type statement.Also, we propose to require that the waterproof, boldface-type statementrequired on each individual package or plant also appear on shipping containers.When individual packages or plants are enclosed in shipping containers,the statement on the packages or plants is not visible. Requiring the statementto be displayed on shipping containers would help ensure that distributionrestrictions are observed and enforced.(8) We propose to prohibit the interstate movement of calamondin and kumquatplants from any area of Florida where a primary infestation caused by theAsiatic strains has occurred until 2 years after the last infested plantin that area has been destroyed. These areas are listed in current andSection;301.75-7(h)(2)(paragraph (b)(3) in our proposal). This prohibition is necessary becauseof the aggressiveness of the Asiatic strains.(9) We propose to require that calamondin and kumquat plants, other thanthose sealed hermetically in plastic bags at the nursery where they wereproduced, be completly enclosed in containers or in compartments of vehiclesduring movement through Florida. This would prevent accidental surfacecontamination of the plants after they have left the nursery.(10) We propose to add a definition for the term ``own-root-only.''The Area of Florida Affected by the Asiatic StrainsCurrently, the area of Florida where a primary infestation caused by theAsiatic strains has occurred within the past 2 years is identified as:All of Manatee, Pinellas, and Sarasota counties, and Hillsborough Countysouth of State Road 60. Hillsborough County has never had an infestationcaused by the Asiatic strains, and neither have most of Manatee, Pinellas,and Sarasota counties. When this area was originally identified, intensivewalking surveys had not been completed, and the boundaries were drawn toinclude a fairly large buffer area around the infestations. This was necessary,until the infested area could be accurately defined and the infestationsbrought under control, to ensure that fruit moved interstate to commercialcitrus-producing areas of the country did not present a risk of spreadingcitrus canker.Since 1986, when the Asiatic strains were first detected in this area,the number of new infestations has dropped from 266 residential propertiesand one grove in 1986, to 13 residential properties in 1987, to only 2residential properties as of August 1988, and these have been confinedto Anna Maria Island and a grove near the city of Palmetto (both in ManateeCounty). It is clear that the eradication program for the Asiatic strainsis succeeding and that the affected area is relatively small. Therefore,we propose to reduce the area under special restriction because of theAsiatic strains. The proposed area would be comprised of:(a) <T3>Pinellas County: </T3>South of a line formed by State Highway 694,from Redington Shores to the intersection of State Highway 694 and Interstate92, then along Interstate 92 to the eastern shore of Old Tampa Bay;(b) <T3>Manatee County: </T3>West of a line formed by Interstate 301 and Interstate75, then along Interstate 75 to the Sarasota county line; and (c) <T3>Sarasota County: </T3>The area south of the Manatee County line, westof Interstate 75, and north of State Highway 72 and County Road 789 tothe beach.This area is proposed based on the following considerations: the size andnature of the infestations; the distance that bacteria might naturallymove from the site of the infestations; and the proximity of citrus grovesand contiguous, residential properties on which citrus is grown and throughwhich citrus canker could be spread by people, vehicles, and equipment(such as lawn services) moving from one property to another.Addition of Wampi to the List of Regulated Articles.We propose to add the species <T3>Clausena lansium</T3> (Lour.) Skeels (common name, wampi) to the listof regulated articles. Wampi plants in Florida have been found infectedwith the form of citrus canker caused by the Florida nursery strains, and,because wampi is a member of the <T3>Rutaceae </T3>family, which includes many known hosts of the Asiaticstrains, there is good reason to believe that wampi may also be susceptibleto infection by these strains as well. Adding this species to the listof regulated articles appears necessary to prevent the interstate spreadof citrus canker.Certificates for the Interstate Movement of SeedCurrently, the regulations state that seeds may be moved interstate witha certificate only if, among other things, no infestation has been foundin the grove or nursery from which the seed originates.We propose to require that the grove or nursery be free of plants or plantparts infested with or exposed to citrus canker (caused by any strain)for at least 2 years. Seed produced in a nursery or grove that has beenfree of plants or plant parts infested with or exposed to citrus cankerfor at least 2 years would present an extremely small risk of spreadingthis disease interstate.MiscellaneousUnder the current regulations pertaining to interstate movement of fruitwith a certificate is a provision stipulating that all regulated plantsat all nurseries in the State of Florida that contain regulated plantsmust be examined by an inspector approximately every 30 days. These nurseryinspections are important because nurseries are where we have found plantsinfested with the Florida nursery strains. The surveys have proven to beextremely effective in detecting citrus canker, and we have then been ableto trace transplants to groves and take immediate action to protect thegroves. These inspections also provide information necessary for us todetermine whether regulated fruit, seed, and calamondin and kumquat plantsmeet requirements for interstate movement with a limited permit. Therefore,we propose to make issuance of any certificate or limited permit contingenton these inspections being conducted.We propose to define ``United States'' as ``all of the states of the UnitedStates, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, PuertoRico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and all other territoriesand possessions of the United States.''We also propose to make a number of editorial changes to improve the clarityof the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this proposed rulewould have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would notcause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; andwould not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.Regulated FruitWe have proposed several changes that would increase the amount of regulatedfruit that could be eligible for interstate movement to commercial citrus-producingareas of the United States: (1) Groves producing fruit for interstate movementwith a certificate would no longer have to be at least one-half mile fromproperties that have contained, during the past 2 years, plants or plantparts infested with or exposed to the Florida nursery strains; (2) withinone-half to 5 miles of these groves, the presence of plants infested withor at high risk of developing the form of citrus canker caused by the Floridanursery strains would no longer disqualify fruit for interstate movementwith a certificate; and (3) the area of Florida designated as having hadprimary infestations caused by the Asiatic strains would be reduced. Asa result, we estimate that all but about 10,080 of Florida's 600,000 acresof fruit-bearing citrus trees could produce fruit eligible for interstatemovement with a certificate, an increase of about 6 percent over the 1987-1988shipping season. Only a relatively small amount of the regulated fruitproduced on these acres would be moved interstate to commercial citrus-producingareas, however. Most regulated fruit grown in Florida is used to make juiceat processing plants in the state. Less than 20 percent is consumed asfresh fruit, and much of this is consumed in the state or is exported toforeign countries. Figures from the State of Florida Department of Citrusshow that in 1983-1984, the last complete season before Florida was quarantinedfor citrus canker, the amount of fresh fruit shipped to commercial citrus-producingareas of the United States was 4.3 percent of the fresh citrus fruit shippedto all states combined, or about 3 million \4/5\ bushel cartons. Furthermore,most of the regulated fruit that could become eligible for interstate movementwith a certificate if our proposed rule is adopted is now eligible forinterstate movement with a limited permit.We also have proposed several changes in survey requirements. As a result,some groves would need only one survey rather than two, and surveys ofproperties within 5 miles of groves producing fruit for interstate movementwith a certificate would be eliminated. In addition, the timing of somegrove surveys would be changed from between 1 year and 90 days before harvestto between May 1 and December 31, inclusive, during the year before harvest.The reduction in the number of surveys would decrease the regulatory burdenon state and federal offices responsible for conducting surveys of residentialproperties and commercial groves. Although the May through December timingproposed for some surveys would reduce the amount of time inspectors haveto complete the surveys, this should not present a problem since the overallnumber of surveys would be greatly reduced. The proposed changes in surveyrequirements would have very little, if any, economic impact on personsinvolved in growing, handling, or shipping regulated fruit interstate,or on the amount of regulated fruit moved interstate. We have proposed to remove the requirement that personnel, vehicles, andequipment be treated upon entering a grove producing fruit for interstatemovement with a certificate. However, we have proposed to add a requirementthat personnel, vehicles, and equipment be treated upon entering any groveof 10 or more regulated trees located within the area of Florida wherethere have been primary infestations caused by the Asiatic strains. Theseactions affect production expenses for those grove owners. However, thecost of disinfecting personnel, vehicles, and equipment is minor when comparedto overall production expenses, and adding or removing this requirementsshould have little economic impact on persons producing fruit for interstatemovement.We have proposed to require that groves of 10 or more regulated trees producingfruit for interstate movement with a limited permit obtain regulated plantsduring the year before the interstate movement only from nurseries inspectedand found free of citrus canker. This change would have little economicimpact on persons moving regulated fruit interstate with a limited permitsince all nurseries in the State of Florida are already being surveyedas proposed, and Florida law restricts the movement of plants from nurseriesfound to be infested. We have proposed to prohibit the interstate movement of regulated fruitfrom any grove that is within one-half mile of any property where a primaryinfestation caused by the Asiatic strains has occurred within the past2 years. This provision would apply to one commercial grove (the site ofa primary infestation in Manatee County) and 24,000 residential properties.However, no fruit is being moved from these properties now because Floridalaw already prohibits the intrastate movement of fruit from these properties.Therefore, our proposal would have no economic impact on persons movingregulated fruit interstate. We have proposed to allow a soap (or detergent) and water treatment forfruit produced in groves of 10 or more regulated trees located outsidethe area of Florida where primary infestations caused by the Asiatic strainshave occurred if the fruit is to be moved interstate with a limited permit.Washing citrus fruit with soap (or detergent) and water is standard practicein packing houses. Eliminating the need for chemical treatment with chlorineor SOPP would reduce the cost of processing this fruit. However, expensesassociated with fruit treatment are not a significant deterrent to theinterstate movement of regulated fruit produced in commercial groves. Therefore,we do not anticipate that the change in this requirement woud have anysignificant economic impact on persons moving regulated fruit interstatewith a limited permit. When fruit must be treated as a condition of interstate movement, we haveproposed to require that treatments be applied either in the presence ofan inspector or at a facility owned by a person operating under a complianceagreement. This action would not pose any additional economic burden onpersons moving regulated fruit interstate since all fruit treatments noware applied at packing houses operating under compliance agreements. We have proposed to allow certain regulated fruit to be moved interstatewithout treatment to parts of the United States that are not commercialcitrus-producing areas. This provision would apply only to regulated fruitproduced in groves of fewer than 10 trees located outside the area of Floridawhere there have been primary infestations caused by the Asiatic strains.This action would reduce the cost to many small entities of moving regulatedfruit interstate with a limited permit. At present, these entities taketheir fruit to a packing house for treatment. Often, the cost of treatmentmakes it too expensive for them to send the fruit to friends or relativesin other states. We anticipate that more small entities will move regulatedfruit interstate as gifts to friends or relatives if treatement is notrequired. Other individuals and businesses would be affected, however,since regulated fruit from groves of fewer than 10 trees may be moved interstateonly if it is sent directly to a household for consumption. Also, the amountof regulated fruit that would be shipped interstate in this manner wouldcontinue to be extremely small when compared to the amount of regulatedfruit shipped interstate in commercial channels. We have proposed to allow the interstate movement of regulated seed fromnurseries or groves that have not contained plants or plant parts exposedto or infested with citrus canker for at least 2 years. This action wouldhave very little economic impact on persons moving regulated seed interstatesince an insignificant amount of this seed is produced in Florida for interstatemovement. Furthermore, most of that is obtained from groves, which have,with few exceptions, been free of citrus canker. WampiWe have proposed to add the species Clausena lansium (Lour.) Skeels (commonname, wampi) to the list of regulated articles. This action should havelittle or no economic impact on persons who move regulated articles interstatesince very little wampi is grown in Florida, and at this time, we are notaware of any wampi being moved interstate.Calamondin and Kumquat PlantsWe have proposed to reduce restrictions on the interstate movement of own-root-onlycalamondin and kumquat plants grown outside the area of Florida where therehas been a primary infestation caused by the Asiatic strains. We also haveproposed to prohibit the interstate movement of grafted or budded calamondinand kumquat plants and all calamondin and kumquat plants grown in areasof Florida where a primary infestation caused by the Asiatic strains hasoccurred. We are not aware of any nurseries that grow calamondin and kumquat plantsin the area of Florida where a primary infestation caused by the Asiaticstrains has occurred.Approximately six nurseries produce container-grown calamondin or kumquatplants, nearly all of which are own-root-only. These plants are seasonal,specialty commodities sold as decorative house plants and for use as indoorlandscaping at shopping malls, office buildings, and other establishments.Although we expect sales of the container-grown plants to increase if thisproposal is adopted, we do not expect the increased sales to have a significanteconomic impact on nurseries or other businesses involved in the sale ofthese plants. This is because calamondin and kumquat plants account foronly a small percentage of these businesses' activities.Individually packaged calamondin plants are own-root-only plants. Theyare sold at many gift shops and roadside fruit stands as decorative indoorhouse plants. Primary purchasers are tourists buying souvenirs before returninghome from the quarantined area. The overwhelming majority of gift shopsand roadside stands selling individually packaged calamondin plants aresmall entities. Sales may increase if this proposal is adopted, but theeconomic impact would be minor as calamondin plants are a very small partof the inventory of these small entities.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determine that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This proposed rule contains no new information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
