In additionto the INF Treaty, the Senate could, prior to adjournment in the fall,be presented with a START treaty, a new accord, on strategic defenses,and new protocols on verification of nuclear testing which could clearthe way for ratification of the long-pending Threshold Test Ban and PeacefulNuclear Explosions Treaties. I hasten to add, however, that the oddsthat such a new dawn could break during the last year of the Reagan administrationare not more than 50/50. Whether 1988 is the occasion for such dramaticarms-control agreements will depend, of course, on unprecedented Sovietcooperation. Under Gorbachev, the Soviets have voiced an apparent willingnessto embrace arms-control concepts which just a few years ago would haveseemed unattainable. These include disproportionate Soviet reductions,on-site inspection, cooperative measures for enhancing national technicalmeans of verification, detailed data exchanges, high-level military meetings,discussions on doctrine and force postures, and important nuclear riskreduction measures. A word of caution is in order. It is too soon todetermine how many of these concepts can be translated into reality.The West must predicate its positions on Soviet deeds, not words. Nevertheless,the advent of Gorbachev, glasnost, and perestroika has undeniably improvedthe overall climate for the conduct of superpower relations.</TEXT></DOC>
