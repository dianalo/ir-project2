Depending on the meteorological conditions atthe site of interest it may be advantageous to combine wind and solarconverters to improve the system's performance. Especially when windand solar data are almost uncorrelated or anti-correlated a combinationof both converters resulted in a significantly smoother energy production.Systems with a renewable fraction greater than 70% are described. Hybridsystems are more complex than pure wind or solar systems, but at leastfor mid-European coastal regions a combination of wind and solar convertersresults in much smaller storage dimensions or higher renewable fractions,respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
