But while sorting out the actual impact may take years, financial planners, accountants and brokers already are assessing which investments now seem more attractive, which less.    One score card of the winners and losers was compiled by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Washington sponsored by major employee-benefit consulting firms. The institute surveyed 124 financial planners last fall, asking them whether demand for each of a number of investments would rise or fall in the wake of tax overhaul, and whether the change would be substantial. (The results of the survey are shown in the accompanying table.)    The big winners, in the planners' judgment, were cash-value life insurance and tax-exempt bonds. The losers? Individual Retirement Accounts and real estate.    Here is a rundown on how some of the major types of investments look in light of the new tax code.    STOCKS   The increase in tax rates on capital gains &quot;makes stocks a little less attractive,&quot; says Robert M. Heier, a financial planner in McLean, Va. The effective rate on long-term gains rises to 28% this year from 20% in 1986. Next year, preferential rates for capital gains disappear, with such income taxed at the same marginal rates -- 33% in the case of taypayers subject to the 5% surcharge -- as ordinary earnings.    Meanwhile, Mr. Heier says, &quot;Tax reform has worked very well for income investments.&quot; Income from taxable bonds and dividends from stocks used to be taxed at a top rate of 50%. The top rate drops to 38.5% this year and 33% beginning in 1988.    Within the stock market, many planners say they sense an increased preference among investors for stocks that pay dividends, now that the tax treatment of dividends is becoming closer to the treatment accorded capital gains.    The tax changes are good news for in-and-out traders. Short-term capital gains long have been taxed as ordinary income, so stock traders have had an incentive to hold stocks for at least six months to qualify for the lower tax rate on long-term gains. Now, that incentive is diminishing. Next year, it will vanish, as long-term and short-term gains are treated the same for tax purposes.    BONDS   Corporate bonds, by virtue of the decreasing tax on income, are a beneficiary of the new tax law. But the picture for municipal bonds is much cloudier. Municipal bonds are affected by several changes, some favorable, some unfavorable.    On the positive side, there are now &quot;very few other places to get tax-free cash flow,&quot; says Tom Ochsenschlager, a partner in the Washington office of Grant Thornton, an accounting firm.    Also, Congress severely restricted the supply of tax-free municipals that don't clearly serve a &quot;public purpose.&quot; Traditionally, so-called private-purpose municipal bonds, such as those used to fund housing or student loans, accounted for about two-thirds of the volume in the municipal market, Mr. Ochsenschlager notes.    Congress has now clamped a tight lid on the amount of such bonds a state and its municipalities can issue with tax-exempt status -- $75 per capita or $250 million, whichever is more. Next year the limit drops to $50 per capita or $150 million. With fewer tax-free, private-purpose bonds on the market, buyers may bid up the prices of those that remain, Mr. Ochsenschlager says.    But the new law also contains negatives for municipal bonds. For people who must pay the alternative minimum tax, the private-purpose variety is now subject to tax. And the lowering of tax brackets means that the shelter feature is less crucial than it once was.    Finally, more restrictive rules for bond holdings by banks and other financial institutions will reduce demand in that sector, possibly hurting prices for bonds. That could help new buyers but hurt existing bondholders.    &quot;Throw all these in the blender, throw it on high, and see what comes out,&quot; Mr. Ochsenschlager shrugs. But the poll of financial planners suggests that most planners think demand for those bonds that remain truly tax free will rise.    MUTUAL FUNDS   The major news here is that many investors are going to be taxed on phantom income.    Previously, mutual fund management fees and certain expenses were deducted from an investor's capital, lowering total return and thus reducing reported earnings. Now, such fees generally will be reported by funds as income to the fund holder. A person with a $10,000 fund holding might receive $400 in true dividends, plus an imputed dividend of, say, $150, representing management fees paid.    The shareholder can deduct the $150 on his income tax if -- and only if -- his miscellaneous itemized deductions exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. Otherwise, he will be taxed on money never received.    REAL ESTATE   Real estate investments have been hit hard. Limited partnership arrangements geared to sheltering income from tax suffer the most. But even individual real estate investments are hurt in two major ways.    First, the depreciation period, typically 19 years under previous law, was lengthened to 27 1/2 years for residential property and to 31 1/2 years for commercial property. Only straight-line depreciation is allowed under the new rules, whereas accelerated depreciation was sometimes permitted under the old.    Second, lower tax rates reduce the tax benefit of the large interest payments typically associated with real estate purchases. An individual who borrows $200,000 to buy a $300,000 building might pay, say, $1,600 a month in interest the first year. When the top tax bracket was 50%, such payments meant a tax savings of $800 a month, or $9,000 a year. Under this year's brackets, the maximum tax savings is about $7,400; next year, it drops to less than $6,500.    Small wonder, then, that most planners in the group's survey expect real estate investments to be hard hit. Some people expect values of existing buildings to decline, but others think values will hold, because few new buildings will be coming onto the market soon. Some optimists think the next couple of years could offer patient investors a chance to buy attractive properties at low prices.    LIFE INSURANCE, ANNUITIES   Both life insurance and annuities (which are often sold by insurance companies) got a boost from the new tax act -- not through what the law did, but through what it didn't do.    The cash-value buildup in a life insurance policy is tax-deferred and partly tax exempt. Congress considered yanking away that privileged tax status, but ended up leaving life insurance pretty much alone, at least for the time being.    Thus, &quot;insurance products are going to be more popular than ever,&quot; says Eli Warach, a tax specialist and attorney with Prentice-Hall Professional Information Group, a tax-book publisher. Particularly hot lately have been single-premium life insurance products, sold with an emphasis on their investment aspects.    Some insurance professionals caution, however, that a person who doesn't really need life insurance may be paying unnecessary charges by buying these products. In addition, life insurance typically involves heavy &quot;front end&quot; expense charges, or loads, primarily to compensate the salesperson.    Annuities, for their part, retain the chief quality that made them of interest to investors before the tax changes. The accumulating retirement fund typically isn't taxed as it builds up, but only when withdrawals begin, after age 59 1/2.    The penalties for early withdrawal from a tax-deferred annuity have been stiffened, to 10% of the amount withdrawn from 5%. That brings the annuity rules into conformity with the rules governing other retirement-oriented investments, like IRAs and Keogh plans.    COMMODITIES, COLLECTIBLES   Investments in tangible items, from art and antiques to coins and precious metals, haven't been greatly affected by the recent tax law changes. However, because most tangibles generate no income or tax benefits, the whole return to the investor is based on the potential capital gain. And, as noted, the tax treatment of capital gains is less favorable than it used to be.    ---   Mr. Dorfman reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                  A Shift in Demand   How financial planners think the new tax law will changeinvestment preferences              Demand                                  Stay at           Will Rise      Rise      Fall   Fall Sub-  Current       Substantially  Somewhat  Somewhat  stantially    Level    Cash-value life insurance                 34%       31%        7%          3%     26%    Tax-exempt bonds                 29        31        12           7      22    Annuities                 24        29        11           3      34    Taxable bonds                 12        29        22           5      32    Stocks       13        29        17           2      39    401(k) plans                 12        21        31           7      29    Defined contribution pension plans                  6        24        23           3      45    Defined benefit pension plans                  4        22        21           8      44    Real estate investments                  4        12        41          27      16    Money market funds                  3        18        15           3      60    IRAs                  4         6        46          36      13   Note: Based on responses from 124 financial plannerssurveyed in September and October 1986   Source: Employee Benefit Research Institute</TEXT></DOC>
