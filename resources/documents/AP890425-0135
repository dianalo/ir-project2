As a result of the finding, cash deposits or bonds to offset theprice advantage will be imposed on the imported uniforms, whichinclude tops, pants and belts.   If the preliminary finding is upheld and the U.S. InternationalTrade Commission determines that the lower-priced imports harm U.S.manufacturers, the Customs Service will be instructed to collectthe final anti-dumping duties.   The investigation began last November, when Century Martial ArtSupply Inc. filed a petition on behalf of the U.S. industry.   Imports of martial arts uniforms from Taiwan totaled $1.2million in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
