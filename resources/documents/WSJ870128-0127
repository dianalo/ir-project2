Now consider this: The U.S. has worked for months to overturn a federal court judgment because it upsets the Soviet Union. Today, U.S. government lawyers will appear at a court hearing in Los Angeles in an effort to rescind the judgment.    Here's what happened: In January 1985, Raphael Gregorian, a U.S. citizen whose company did business with the Soviet Union, sued the U.S.S.R., its Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia and the government-owned trade organizations Medexport and Licensintorg. (He also sued some American parties that aren't pertinent here.) The Soviet defendants refused to appear, and the court gave Mr. Gregorian and his company judgment against them by default.    Last November, after repeated attempts to resolve the case, Mr. Gregorian's attorney tried to take possession of Soviet assets in the U.S. to satisfy the court's judgment. This provoked an official complaint by the Soviet government. And when the Kremlin complained, American diplomacy responded.    The State Department's legal adviser, Abraham Sofaer, sent the court a letter explaining that the U.S. government would support forthcoming Soviet motions to overturn the judgment &quot;so that all relevant arguments can be heard.&quot; Mr. Sofaer advised that pending the court's decision on Soviet motions, &quot;further efforts to enforce the judgment would not be constructive.&quot;    At this point, Medexport and Licensintorg appeared in court to contest the default judgment. The other Soviet defendants still refused to appear.    The U.S. government then filed a &quot;statement of interest&quot; with the court last month. It makes painful reading:    &quot;Instrumentalities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have recently appeared and moved this Court to set aside the default judgment entered against them. . . . The United States supports these requests.&quot;    What reason did the State Department give for its support? &quot;The Soviets regard this litigation as a very serious matter and it has become a significant issue in bilateral United States-Soviet relations,&quot; the statement of interest says. &quot;Those relations are of special importance to the United States in maintaining a stable environment conducive to working bilaterally with the Soviet Union on critical world issues such as arms control.&quot;    More alarming is the sworn declaration of Thomas W. Simons Jr., deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Consider Mr. Simons's reasoning: &quot;Denying the Soviet Union an opportunity to present its views in court . . . can be expected to affect our bilateral relations with that country.&quot;    But the Soviets had denied themselves their day in court, and the American court had entered a default judgment, the usual penalty to deter no-shows.    Finally, Mr. Simons states: &quot;The {State Department's} Legal Adviser stated that if the Soviet defendants {Medexport and Licensintorg} were to appear, the United States Government would support appropriate motions by their counsel to reopen the default judgment.&quot;    In other words, it was in effect a swap, like guns for hostages or a journalist for a spy. The net effect is that in return for Medexport and Licensintorg appearing in court last November, months after the law required them to appear, the State Department agreed to support their efforts to contest the default judgment.    Like those other swaps, this one is ultimately damaging to U.S. interests. Paying for something the law requires only encourages lawlessness. Why should the Kremlin's wishes be put above our legal system?    In the Gregorian case, the Soviets claim sovereign immunity. It's one thing for the Soviets to claim immunity from suit but quite another for the U.S. government, under diplomatic pressure, to intervene in that claim. That's why Congress in 1976 enacted the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which, in the words of the House Judiciary Committee, was supposed to transfer &quot;determination of sovereign immunity from the executive branch to the judicial branch.&quot; According to the committee, &quot;The Department of State would be freed from pressures from foreign governments to recognize their immunity from suit and from any adverse consequences resulting from an unwillingness of the {State} Department to support that immunity.&quot; Simply put, the U.S. government may urge foreign governments to come to court, but it should refuse to assist their litigation.    The State Department should let our legal system work, not lobby it for the Politburo. Due process gives the Soviets the right to come to court, through appropriate private counsel, and make their arguments. By intervening in that process, the State Department disdains it.    The Kremlin has seen that disdain before. Instead of dismantling illegal Soviet barriers to communications between our two countries, the U.S. settles for cultural &quot;exchanges&quot; that let Soviet authorities control our contacts with their citizens and vice versa. As for Soviet jamming of our radio broadcasts, the U.S. hopes to pay for its right to broadcast by urging U.S. radio networks to carry Soviet programs.    The message is that U.S. diplomacy will bargain for something it has already paid for and pay for performance that is already due. That message, conspicuous in our mismanagement of the Helsinki human-rights accords and the Gregorian case, undermines the rule of law and our statecraft.    ---   Mr. Pearl is a lawyer in Santa Monica, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
