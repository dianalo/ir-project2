But the Democrats' national chairman called todayfor a positive party platform.   Paul Kirk, addressing Democratic platform drafters on MackinacIsland, Mich., said the party needs ``a pragmatic, principled andpositive statement that American people can read and reflect uponand say, `That's the kind of country I want my kids to grow upin.'''   As for the specifics that many groups are demanding the platforminclude, he said, ``I don't think we'll end up with the YellowPages, an ad for every organized group.''   Meanwhile, a pair of polls published today suggested theDemocratic ticket would be hurt if Jesse Jackson were Dukakis'running mate. A USA Today-CNN survey indicated Dukakis has a clearlead over Bush _ unless he picks Jackson as his running mate. Andan ABC-Washington Post poll suggested Jackson's presence on theticket would hurt Dukakis among key groups whose backing he needsto win in November.   Both Bush and Dukakis looked ready for a long hot summer leadingup to their respective parties' conventions. Although thepost-primary, pre-convention period traditionally marks a lull incampaign activity, the two rivals are indicating they won't waitfor formal nominee status to begin their battle.   ``There's no reason to wait till the World Series to startswinging,'' said Bush, in Texas to address delegates at the stateGOP convention on Thursday. ``This is a new ball game _ springtraining is over.''   The vice president criticized Dukakis' positions on a variety oftopics, saying the Massachusetts governor would raise taxes, plagueinnocent taxpayers with IRS audits, weaken national defense, besoft on crime and put forth an isolationist foreign policy.   ``My opponent is an articulate defender of a flawed worldview,'' said Bush. ``His views and values are too often ... out ofthe mainstream.''   Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach said ``it's clear thatthe vice president doesn't think his own record or vision can bringhim the votes he needs in November.''   ``Given where George Bush is in the polls, I think it's nosurprise that he's chosen to spend his time mudslinging and tearingdown,'' Dach said.   Late Thursday night on ABC-TV, Bush engaged ``Nightline'' anchorTed Koppel in combative debate, occasionally calling him ``Dan'' inslips harking back to the vice president's 9-minute faceoff lastJanuary with CBS' Dan Rather.   As Rather had, Koppel questioned Bush closely on his knowledgeof the clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran. Bush said, as he hasrepeatedly, that he knew little of the arms dealing while it wasgoing on.   In the midst of one pointed exchange, Koppel said to Bush that``I find your answer ... inconsistent.''   ``Well, that's your opinion,'' Bush said. ``You ask thequestions but you don't like the answer. What do you want me tosay?''   A series of recent nationwide polls suggested Dukakis had theedge in a faceoff with Bush, with some surveys putting the lead indouble digits.   The latest such survey, the CNN-USA Today poll, gave Dukakis a6-point lead over Bush, 45 percent to 39 percent.   Dukakis became the certain Democratic nominee on Tuesday, whenthe final four primaries of the season gave him the delegates heneeds for a first-ballot victory in Atlanta. Bush put away his GOPrivals months ago.   Three of those former opponents _ Kansas Sen. Bob Dole,television evangelist Pat Robertson and Rep. Jack Kemp _ werejoining Bush at a Republican ``unity conference'' today in Denver.   And the Atlanta Constitution reported in today's editions thatformer Dukakis rival Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. is planning toendorse Dukakis, possibly during a Dukakis campaign trip throughthe South next week.   Jackson was out of public view on Thursday, resting up at theposh La Costa resort outside San Diego. He held strategy meetingswith about a dozen top aides to map out his next moves.   The ABC-Washington Post survey, published in today's editions ofthe Post, said Jackson was the top choice of Democrats as a Dukakisrunning mate, but that his presence on the ticket would badly erodeDukakis' support among Southern Democrats, Reagan Democrats andindependent voters.   And Dukakis' lead over Bush in the USA Today-CNN survey wasreversed when Jackson was added on as a running mate. With Jacksonon the ticket, Dukakis' 6-point lead changed to a 7-point deficit.   The Post's poll of 656 Democrats, conducted May 19-25, had a4-point margin of error. The USA Today survey of 1,253 registeredvoters, was conducted June 6-9 and had a margin of error of 3percentage points.   The Massachusetts governor attended a victory bash Thursdaynight in Boston. He said he expected a ``tough and competitive''campaign.   In other campaign developments:   _California video magnate Stuart Karl was charged Thursday withillegally funneling money to the campaigns of Gary Hart and otherpolitical candidates. A federal grand jury indictment accuses Karlof conspiracy, false statement-concealment in a matter before agovernment agency, making an illegal corporate contribution to afederal candidate, making excessive contributions to a candidateand making a campaign contribution in the name of another.   _Dukakis' wife Kitty was released from Massachusetts GeneralHospital on Thursday, six days after undergoing spinal surgery.Mrs. Dukakis, 51, had two bone fragments taken from her hip andfused to a pair of ruptured discs. The ruptured discs had beenputting dangerous pressure on her spinal cord.</TEXT></DOC>
