The conservatorship, under which the federal ResolutionTrust Corp. will take over management of the thrift, wasimposed two years to the day after Southwest Savings enteredthe Southwest Plan by acquiring four insolvent Texas thriftswith $2 billion in non-cash assistance from the government.</LP><TEXT>   The Southwest Plan, before it expired in a storm ofcriticism at the end of 1988, was the program launched by thenow-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to staveoff further insurance-fund losses from failing Texas thrifts.Under the plan, scores of Texas thrifts were merged into 15institutions that received varying degrees of governmentassistance, including notes and income-tax breaks, to keepthem afloat.   For some of the new thrifts, such as First GibraltarSavings Association, the government assistance has led tohigh profits for their owners and prompted calls in Congressfor a review and possible restructuring of the deals. ButSouthwest Savings, which became Texas's third-largest thriftwith $5.4 billion in assets, wasn't destined to be among thesurvivors, and a second government intervention was widelyexpected.   The bulk of the assistance Southwest had received, or $1.5billion, was in income and capital guarantees to cover losseson $2.6 billion in assets held by the four thrifts itacquired. The government never came through with guaranteesto cover Southwest's own troubled loans and repossessed realestate, which proved to be the thrift's undoing.   By March 31 of this year, Southwest's tangible capital hadfallen to a negative $303.5 million, &quot;with no prospect ofreplenishment without federal assistance,&quot; the Office ofThrift Supervision said Friday when it appointed the RTC asSouthwest's conservator.   The RTC named Steve Deaton as managing conservator toreplace C. Todd Miller as the chief executive of the thrift,which has $3.9 billion in deposits and 69 branches acrossTexas.   The Office of Thrift Supervision was careful to note theaccomplishments of Mr. Miller's management, pointing out thatoperating costs had been reduced by almost $76 million duringthe past two years and that the thrift had sold almost $404.6million in repossessed real estate and other assets.   While in conservatorship, Southwest will continue to beowned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate and itsbeneficiaries, according to an RTC spokesman. The Office ofThrift Supervision will have to place Southwest Savings inreceivership before it is offered for sale or liquidated, theRTC spokesman said.   Southwest Savings has been another disappointinginvestment for Caroline Hunt, heiress of oil man H.L. Hunt.Through her Rosewood Corp. holding company, she has alsotaken sizeable losses in real estate and in her holdings ofFirst Executive Corp., the Los Angeles-based insuranceholding company.   In other RTC actions in Texas on Friday, the agency wasappointed receiver for the $68.7 million First Savings andamp; LoanAssociation of Borger and for the $178.9 million FirstFederal Savings and Loan Association of Conroe. New federalmutual associations, to be managed by the RTC, were formed toacquire certain assets and liabilities of each of theinstitutions.   The RTC on Friday also approved the sale of CornerstoneFederal Savings Association of Houston to Great SouthwestSavings of Houston at an estimated cost to the RTC of $24.3million. Great Southwest acquired all of Cornerstone's $83.8million in deposits and just over half of its $82.4 millionin assets.
