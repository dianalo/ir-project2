Official newspapers Wednesday reprinted a 1956 article by seniorleader Deng Xiaoping that focused on the party's efforts to adaptsocialism to fit China's needs, and its duty to set a moral examplefor the public.   Deng, responding to questions raised by a youth group, saidCommunist Party members were ``advanced elements among the commonpeople'' who can lead China down the ``happy road to socialism.''   The renewed call for party members to ``serve the peoplewholeheartedly'' is part of the party's effort to regain publicconfidence following massive pro-democracy protests this year.   Party hardliners, who ordered the army to crush the student-ledprotests on June 3-4, are blaming the demonstrations and violence onousted party leader Zhao Ziyang and a small group of dissidents itaccuses of promoting ``anti-Chinese,'' or unpatriotic, ideas.   There are no signs yet of the xenophobia of the 1966-76ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, when even tenuous contacts withthe outside world drew severe political persecution.   After a decade of openness, China's leaders appear unwilling tojeopardize foreign trade and international aid. They make only vagueattacks on Western democratic ideas.   But those attacks portray the Communist Party as the nation'sdefenders against a conspiracy to replace its customs and traditionswith Western culture and socialism with capitalism.   ``Today, restoration of capitalism in China can only turn thesocialist country into a dependency of the West. The Chinese nation,except for the traitors, will never agree to this,'' the People'sDaily said Tuesday.   State Council spokesman Yuan Mu on Wednesday accused ``someforeign powers'' of contributing to the pro-democracy movement andof stirring up a ``wave of anti-Chinese feeling.''   The party has justified its arrests of many Chinese dissidents bycharging that they opposed communism and rejected Chinese culture.   Dissidents such as astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who is in hiding inthe U.S. Embassy in Beijing, ``looked down on (China's) ancient landand our yellow-skinned countrymen to such an extent that they evendreamed of extinguishing the Chinese race,'' the Beijing Daily said.   The official commentaries blame Zhao, who is believed to be underhouse arrest, for corruption and have repeatedly criticized him forsupporting a controversial TV series broadcast last year, ``RiverElegy,'' that questions the superiority of traditional Chineseculture.   ``River Elegy taunted and condemned the Yellow River and theGreat Wall ... (and) went on to use yellow water, yellow soil,yellow beans, yellow rice and yellow skin as signs of China'sbackward and hopeless civilization,'' the Beijing Daily said.   The People's Daily, the official party newspaper, said the series``repudiates the achievements made by socialist China ... Whileeulogizing and beautifying Western or capitalist civilization.''   An author of the series, Su Xiaokang, is blamed in some accountsfor inciting the pro-democracy protests with Zhao's support.   But Su, who was arrested in June, said ``River Elegy'' wasintended to encourage ``enlightenment and help the Chinese peoplefind a way out for their country.''   The party's efforts to meld partriotism and party influence isaimed at recapturing the influence lost by the pro-democracyprotests and the resulting crackdown, in which hundreds werebelieved to have died.   The protesters' complaints of official corruption touched asensitive chord among the general public and posed a clear challengeto the party's moral leadership. Hundreds of thousands of peopletook to the streets to cheer the protesters and to voice their owngrievances.   Chinese say privately that few people are cooperating with partyofficials sent to work units to investigate supporters of theprotests.</TEXT></DOC>
