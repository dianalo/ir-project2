Those guidelinesare helpful because planning faces three basic challenges: politically-motivateddevelopment plans that may overrun resource limitations, the balancebetween citizen needs and the ecological imperative, and the legacy ofpast mistakes. Although the actual planning processes in place may lacksome of the elements, the main principles of effective water resourceplanning are well agreed. However, four obstacles stand in the way ofeffective planning: (2) lack of agreement among participants on practicaloperating principles, (2) misuse of local money-making opportunitiesby foreign contractors or consultants, (3) politically-motivated rapid,unplanned development, and (4) lack of decision power for planners inthe face of assertive resource owners and managers. Several directionsare outlined toward a resolution of the obstacles, including the reappropriationof responsible decision-making influence by planners and the supportby concerned professional groups of the planners' culture-change efforts.The use of a planning simulation gaming model is suggested as one partof this professional support.</TEXT></DOC>
