In Beirut, Shiite Moslem kidnappers holding at least twoAmerican hostages threatened to punish their captives inretaliation for the Israeli strikes.   Police said 35 people were wounded in the half-hour Israeliattacks, including civilians in a clinic. They said 12 Israelifighter-bombers and two helicopter gunships made seven bombing runs.   The main targets of the attack were training bases andammunition dumps of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the PalestineLiberation Organization near the port city of Sidon and the BekaaValley town of Mashgara.   Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon, is 25 miles south ofBeirut. Mashgara, which faces the forward lines of the Syrian army,is 16 miles east of Sidon.   The fundamentalist Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God,claimed responsibility for Wednesday's car bombing, which alsowounded eight Israeli soldiers and two Lebanese women.   The air raids were Israel's 16th into Lebanon this year. Apolice spokesman said on condition of anonymity that eight peoplewere killed and 15 wounded around Sidon and that seven were killedand 20 wounded in Mashgara.   The jets scored direct hits on a Hezbollah ammunition depot nearthe Palestinian refugee camp of Mieh Mieh on the outskirts of Sidonand set it ablaze, the spokesman said.   Two of the rockets slammed into a Hezbollah clinic attached toits main base in Mashgara, and two Lebanese physicians and threenurses were injured, the spokesman said.   ``Most of the wounded in Mashgara were civilians at theclinic,'' he said.   Wailing women beat their chests while workers pulled victimsfrom the rubble of Hezbollah's clinic. A child climbed on top ofthe debris to plant the party's red, white and green flag.   Ambulances with gunmen shooting into the air raced past, andflames shot up from the smoking arms depot.   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual guide,said the air raid targeted the clinic.   ``Our mujahedeen (holy warriors) strike at soldiers and theystrike at civilians. ... Our arm is longer than Israel's,''Fadlallah said in a sermon at a south Beirut mosque crowded withShiites.   Hezbollah is an umbrella group for Shiite militants believedholding most of the nine Americans and five other foreign hostagesin Lebanon.   Friday's threat to the hostages came in typewritten statementsin Arabic signed by the Islamic Jihad, the faction holdingAssociated Press Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson andeducator Thomas Sutherland.   A statement delivered to a Western news agency included aninstant color photograph of Anderson in a beard and T-shirt.   ``The criminal America must realize it will not get away withwhat it has done, especially in connection with the hostages wehold,'' the statement said.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman calledfor an end to violence between Israel and Lebanon and urgedLebanese kidnappers to free their hostages.   The police spokesman said the warplanes fired 18 rockets intotwo bases used by Hezbollah in Mashgara while the helicoptersstrafed the town and its surroundings. He said Syrian troops werenot involved.   Guerrilla defenders opened up with anti-aircraft fire as thejets released scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seekingsurface-to-air missiles. No planes were hit, he said.   The Israelis also hit two training bases run by PLO ChairmanYasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction in Mieh Mieh and thenearby camp of Ein el-Hilweh, he said.   Fawzieh Mattar, 37, said she saw the first rocket slamming intothe depot near Sidon.   ``The rocket shot straight through the gate. It caused a hugeexplosion accompanied by a big ball of fire, and several explosionsfollowed,'' said Ms. Mattar, a Palestinian who lives at Mieh Miehwith her parents.   She said several refugees evacuated the camp after Wednesday'scar bombing in anticipation of Israeli retaliation, but her familydidn't have any place to go.   Hiam Saleh, 18, said her father also refused to evacuate hisfamily of seven.   ``We stayed in an air raid shelter in the camp, but occasionallyI came out to watch the planes attacking,'' Ms. Saleh said. ``Veryfew civilians were wounded by shrapnel. Most of the casualties werecombatants manning the depot and Fatah base.''   Israeli gunners in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone ofsouth Lebanon also hammered the town and the nearby village ofLuwayzeh with 155 mm howitzers.   In Jerusalem, the military command said the raid was aimed at``Palestinian targets in the Sidon area and Hezbollah command postsin the villages of Mashgara and Luwayzeh.''   Israeli officials often charge that Hezbollah and the PLO arecooperating in guerrilla warfare against Israeli troops and alliedmilitiamen in south Lebanon.   The Jewish state vowed to retaliate for Wednesday's bombing, thedeadliest attack against Israelis in south Lebanon in 2{ years. InMarch 1985, a suicide driver detonated a car bomb, killing 12Israelis and wounding 14.   Israel pulled most of its army from south Lebanon in June 1985after a three-year occupation and carved out the 6- to 10-milesecurity zone to prevent guerrilla infiltration into its northernsettlements.   Police say 26 people were killed and 108 wounded in the previousIsraeli air raids this year.</TEXT></DOC>
