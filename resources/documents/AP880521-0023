(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A California congressman says Democraticplatform writers should be mindful that ``a significant wing'' ofthe party shares the Jackson campaign's view that Pentagon budgetsshould be pared by $200 billion over the next four years.   ``Either we're a party advocating peace or we're a partyadvocating war,'' Rep. Ron Dellums, representing both JesseJackson's campaign and his own views, told the party's platformcommittee Friday.   He proposed sharp cuts in military weaponry and calling homesome of the 325,000 U.S. troops in Europe. Fears of a land warbreaking out with the Soviets are a ``gross absurdity and greatwaste of resources,'' he said.   But two Democratic senators who are mentioned as possiblerunning mates for front-runner Michael Dukakis said the party muststand for a strong national defense.   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia said ``there is some reason for hope''for an era of improved relations with the Soviet Union.   ``But in terms of designing a U.S. defense strategy ... we mustacknowledge that under (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev, Sovietmilitary power has not gone down. (It) has increased,'' said Nunn,chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.   ``We must measure our defense commitment not against Sovietintentions, which can change overnight, but against Soviet militarycapabilities,'' Nunn said.   Sen. John Glenn of Ohio said the public was laboring under themisconception that breakthroughs in nuclear arms talks will freethe United States to cut the Pentagon budget.   Glenn said the truth was ``exactly the opposite. ... We may haveto spend more instead of less,'' at least in the short term, onconventional weapons.   But Dellums drew loud applause from the audience of 100 at theforum on defense policy with his call for reducing plannedincreases for the Pentagon. The military budget has doubled from$144 billion in fiscal 1980 to $299 billion for fiscal 1989.   ``I represent a point of view that is a significant wing of theDemocratic Party,'' said Dellums. ``I don't believe that we cantiptoe into the White House. ... I don't believe that we cancontinue to play the game of `Me too,''' on defense spending.   Bill Myrtetus of Ardmore, Pa., a Pennsylvania state Democraticcommitteeman and member of the platform panel, said that from whathe has heard back home, grassroots Democrats could have writtenDellums' speech.   ``People say cut the military budget,'' Myrtetus said after themeeting.   Both Jackson and Dukakis oppose the MX and Midgetman missilesand have sharply criticized the Reagan administration's StrategicDefense Initiative missile defense program. But Dukakis has talkedof bolstering conventional U.S. forces.   Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, a Senate candidate whomoderated the forum, told reporters afterward, ``We can't simply beagainst everything. We have to articulate a vision of what we willdo positively to defend this country.''   Nunn said, ``We have a worldwide commitment whether we like itor not. There's no one going to take our place in the free world.''   But Nunn added, ``The time is overdue for a review of therelative defense burden of the United States and our allies.'' Hesaid Japan should defend sea and air lanes within 1,000 miles ofits coast, and help Third World countries staggering under debts.   ``We should say to the Japanese: `It's your turn for a MarshallPlan,''' said Nunn.   The platform writers also heard presentations on terrorism,nuclear arms proliferation and other military and foreign policyissues.</TEXT></DOC>
