Kemp, who has already toured several public housing projects inan ambitious schedule, outlined a series of sharp turns away fromthe last eight years and said he's ``willing to be audacious'' inaddressing inner city problems.   He said his priorities include strong enforcement of last year'sfair housing law, the revitalization of what he called the ``ThirdWorld economies'' of inner cities and a hope to end homelessness inthe United States.   ``I believe that a dream must be recaptured for our urban citiesand for those people, urban and rural, who today live their lives inpoverty and despair,'' said Kemp, a former nine-term congressmanfrom upstate New York.   But members of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and UrbanAffairs were as impressed with his appearance as with what Kempsaid. His predecessor, Samuel Pierce, last testified in Congress inMarch 1985 as HUD became a battleground over Reagan era spending onsocial programs.   ``Snow, sleet or rain, I think it's very symbolic that I am heretoday,'' said Kemp, adding, ``We're all in the process of puttingaside partisan difference to see what works.''   He pledged to ``implement vigorously'' the law Congress passedlast year strengthening federal regulations against housingdiscrimination.   ``I am going to steward HUD into a new era of fair housingenforcement,'' Kemp said. ``We will try to end, to the extentpossible, discrimination in housing.''   Kemp also promised that President Bush will fully fund theMcKinney Act, which Congress passed last year over Reaganadministration objections, to provide housing for the homeless.   ``This, from a historical standpoint, is something that can nolonger be neglected,'' he said. ``I'm not going to approach thisfrom some 18th century laissez faire attitude ... I believe ourpriority should be to end (homelessness).''   A booster of enterprise zones, in which businesses would get taxbreaks for locating in certain areas, Kemp said he will push the petproject but bowed to opponents by saying, ``I don't think ofenterprise zones as a panacea.''   ``My mind is open,'' he told the committee. ``My door is open. Iwant you to know my heart will be open to solutions as well.''   Although most members of the committee lauded Kemp warmly,several urged him to seek more money for housing programs and saidthey'll judge his commitment by the bottom line in President Bush'sbudget.   ``Hope is no substitute for a positive program,'' said Rep. NancyPelosi, D-Calif. ``I will hold you to your rhetoric and your claimto do something about homelessness.''</TEXT></DOC>
