Vice President Dan Quayle gave reporters a preview of therhetoric to come by singling out Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell of Maine for blocking consideration of thecapital gains tax cut in 1989. &quot;You ought to call it theGeorge Mitchell recession, and I'm going to keep saying itover and over again because it's true,&quot; Mr. Quayle said.&quot;Those that have stymied our program are going to have to beheld accountable.&quot;   The White House strategy, however, is unlikely to satisfymany Republicans, who believe the president is endangeringhis own chances of re-election by ignoring the economy'sproblems. &quot;The notion of sitting back and doing nothing whilethe voters get angrier and angrier about a sagging economy issimply not going to play,&quot; said GOP Rep. Vin Weber ofMinnesota. And conservative activist David Keene argues thatthe president &quot;does not seem to have a real sense of where hewants to go.&quot;   The decision to do nothing until next year was reinforcedat a meeting of the president's economic advisers Friday. Atthe meeting, several presidential advisers argued that thebrouhaha over credit-card interest rates last weekdemonstrated the dangers of even suggesting measures to helpthe economy at the end of a congressional session.   White House officials have continued to attack a Senatebill to limit credit-card rates as preposterous, even thoughthe legislation came a day after President Bush himselfsuggested that rates should go lower. Mr. Bush said, &quot;Thatnever occurred to me that somebody was going to introducelegislation . . . I didn't think about it then. Maybe Ishould have.&quot;   At a lunch, Budget Director Richard Darman said &quot;theend-of-session psychology is frequently very poor inCongress.&quot; He argued that the State of the Union address,which will be given in late January or early February, is abetter time to set a strong economic agenda. &quot;In the generalpublic's mind there's a ritual, a rhythm of renewal . . . tothe State of the Union,&quot; he said.   Mr. Darman also argued that the problem was largely one ofpublic relations. &quot;I think that we have not yet done as gooda job as we should do in communicating effectively what it iswe're really for and why it really does make sense,&quot; he said.&quot;We're aware of the problem and we're working on it.&quot;   Much of the most intense criticism has come from the rightwing of the president's own party. Dan Mitchell, an economicanalyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, dismissesWhite House economic policy as &quot;taxes, regulation and easymoney,&quot; referring to the 1990 deficit reduction agreement,environmental legislation and Mr. Bush's calls for lowerinterest rates. &quot;Carternomics doesn't work any better forGeorge Bush than it did for Jimmy Carter,&quot; Mr. Mitchell says.   The president's top economic advisers have argued for sometime that the administration shouldn't try to fine-tune theeconomy, and instead should focus on long-term growth. Aslong ago as February 1990, the White House Council ofEconomic Advisers wrote that attempts to influence theeconomy in the short run &quot;can be detrimental to good economicperformance.&quot;   But the president's critics say he's failed to make eventhat case convincingly. He would do better, says Mr. Keene,&quot;if he were able to say with conviction that anything we dowill screw it up, and by God we are on the right course andnobody is going to change it.&quot;   Instead, the president's wavering has created theimpression that he doesn't know what to do. Presidentialscholar Fred Greenstein says the president appears to havebeen &quot;caught flat-footed by a hemorrhaging of domesticsupport.&quot; Mr. Greenstein asserts that while Mr. Bush soundedvery confident during the Persian Gulf war, when discussingthe economy recently he has lapsed into the shrill,fragmented syntax &quot;that betray this man when he's notcomfortable with himself.&quot;   Even if the president were to put forward an economicrescue plan now, he would likely be attacked for merelycaving in to political pressure -- as he has appeared to dorecently on other issues, including unemploymentcompensation, the civil rights bill and the cancellation ofhis trip to Asia. &quot;Whatever he does now is going to be seenas reactive,&quot; says GOP pollster Bill McInturff.   The president's indecisiveness has fostered publicbickering among his own advisers. Most notably, Housing andUrban Development Secretary Jack Kemp has said in interviewsand on television that he believes the president shouldimmediately begin pushing a tax cut through Congress.   Mr. Darman said his differences with Mr. Kemp were merely&quot;tactical.&quot; And, he said of Mr. Kemp: &quot;On balance, he hasbeen a net plus publicly for the administration, so I wouldnot want to be critical of him.&quot;   Vice President Quayle, meanwhile, plans to take hismessage on the road this week with a speech in Tennessee, andanother in Chicago later in the month. That message, he says,is that a capital-gains tax cut is &quot;a silver bullet&quot; thatwill &quot;create jobs and put America back to work.&quot; By blockingthe administration's proposal on grounds of fairness, Mr.Quayle adds, Democratic leaders in Congress are &quot;willing torisk keeping people poor because one person may get rich.&quot;   &quot;Congress has basically told us they're not going to passthe president's growth package,&quot; Mr. Quayle says. &quot;We'vebasically said, `OK . . . there's no use staying around. Yougo home, listen to the American people, and be prepared towork when you get back in January.' &quot;   ---   Michel McQueen contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
