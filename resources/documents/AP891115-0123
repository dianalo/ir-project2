SEARLES</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police began registering residents' semiautomaticassault weapons under a new city ordinance today, with opponentsthreatening a court fight.   Lawyer Duncan Cameron was the only person to register a weaponin the first hour.   ``I don't like registering my possessions, but the law requiresit,'' said the former chief Denver district attorney. ``I feel moresecure at night owning one of these.''   Police have received hundreds of calls from gun owners seekinginformation on the law. Owners have 60 days to register their guns.   The ordinance was introduced in the wake of growing gangactivity in the city and mass killings around the nation by gunmenusing such weapons. Denver's sensitivity to the issue washeightened earlier this year when a man with a submachine gunkilled two people and wounded three in suburban Littleton.   Police checked the serial number on Cameron's AK-47 lookalikerifle and ran a background check on him. He then paid his $30license fee and left.   Lt. Gary Walter, commander of the department's firearms bureau,said he could not estimate how many guns would be registered.``Maybe I'm optimistic, but I think the majority of the people aregoing to comply,'' he said. ``If the majority of the people comply,I think it will have an effect.''   But Cameron, 48, said he suspected many gun owners won'tregister their weapons for fear the City Council will declare themillegal in the future. The ordinance specifically bans the sale ofmore than 30 models of semiautomatic assault weapons. Federal lawcontrols ownership of fully automatic weapons.   Failure to register a weapon already owned _ or possession of aregistered weapon with a magazine having more than 20 rounds _ canbring fines of $100 to $999 and jail terms of 10 days to sixmonths. The weapon would be destroyed upon conviction.   A similar bill was defeated in the last session of theLegislature.   Gun owners turned out in force to lobby against the ordinance:297 people signed up to speak against it at a hearing; only 30asked to speak in support. The City Council passed the ordinanceNov. 6 on a 9-4 vote.   The Firearms Coalition of Colorado announced it will file alawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance.   George Nyfeler, National Riflemen Association's fieldrepresentative for Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, said his majorcomplaint with the ordinance is that it leaves too much``subjective interpretation'' of what constitutes an assaultweapon. He said it also gives police ``unrestrained authority.''   ``It scares the hell out of me and should scare the hell out ofevery citizen in Denver,'' Nyfeler said Tuesday.   Not so, said ordinance author and Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds.   ``I am hopeful a majority of people in Denver who currently ownthese weapons will understand the wisdom of getting these gunsregistered,'' Reynolds said.   ``It is a very strong conviction of mine that these weapons haveno place in our community. They are built as anti-personnel assaultweapons. We don't need them in an urban environment,'' she said.``I'm convinced it is a technically good bill and can be enforcedproperly.''   The ordinance specifies 23 models of rifles, seven of pistolsand three of shotguns and their variations. It excludes mostsemiautomatic sporting firearms.   After the Littleton shootings in March, Reynolds introduced aresolution declaring the council's intention to pass a lawrestricting or prohibiting the sale of semiautomatic weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
