The agreement Thursday resolved civil charges that includedinsider trading in more than 20 alleged fraud schemes and markedanother milestone in the government's crackdown on white-collarcorruption.   It also cleared the way for Drexel to plead guilty to six felonycounts and pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution in aseparate settlement of criminal charges with the Manhattan U.S.attorney's office.   Separately, Milken agreed today to set aside more than $600million in assets that could be forfeited if he is found guilty ofcharges in a sweeping fraud and racketeering charges that nameshim, his brother Lowell and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg.   The assets are being set aside under an agreement betweendefense attorneys and federal prosecutors, who could have sought tofreeze all of the Milkens' assets pending the outcome of theirtrials.   Michael and Lowell Milken _ who himself agreed to set aside $50million in assets _ also each agreed to post $1 million bailsecured by other assets in order to remain free pending trial.Newberg is scheduled to be arraigned April 25.   On Thursday, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder called the Drexelsettlement, reached after four months of often-bitter negotiations,``the most far-reaching relief ever obtained by the commissionagainst a major regulated entity.''   Drexel, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, agreed tosubmit to extensive monitoring by the SEC for three years; set up asecurities compliance watchdog committee and a disciplinary panel;and appoint a new chairman, general counsel, ombudsman andaccounting chief subject to SEC approval.   In addition, Drexel agreed to terminate all relations withMilken, who helped transform Drexel into a Wall Street powerhouseby peddling high-risk securities known as junk bonds, and to barits employees from direct or indirect business dealings with him.   The settlement also ensures Drexel's cooperation in any futuregovernment investigations.   ``We think it achieves everything that's needed for theprotection of the investing public,'' SEC Enforcement Director GaryLynch said. ``It will also give us the ability to bring otherpeople to justice that might not be brought to justice if we hadstayed at war for another three to five years.''   Milken could be rehired only if he is exonerated of all 98racketeering and fraud charges filed by the government in aseparate indictment that seeks $1.8 billion in forfeitures from himand two others.   Drexel and Milken have been the main government targets sincethe Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal of 1986. Boesky, now infederal prison, has been a leading source of evidence againstDrexel, Milken and others.   Drexel said in a summary of the agreement that it was paying thelargest penalties ever in a securities case and making``comprehensive and unprecedented structural changes'' that placethe private firm under tight scrutiny.   ``We expect that as a result of this settlement agreement andother steps we will take, Drexel will become the standard in thesecurities industry,'' said Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H.Joseph.   Drexel, which said it lost an estimated $2 billion in businessduring the government's investigation and spent hundreds ofmillions of dollars defending itself, also immediately named as itschairman John S.R. Shad, who started the Drexel probe during his1981-87 term as SEC chairman.   In addition, Drexel will pay $15 million in civil penalties, anamount already accounted for under the total $650 million inpenalties it has agreed to pay the government.   The 184-page SEC complaint filed last September described 21alleged fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986 and portrayedDrexel, Milken and others as systematic cheaters who engaged instock manipulation, insider trading and other frauds.   The pact still must be approved by U.S. District Judge MiltonPollack, who temporarily has been barred from any rulings in thecase while the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to hear adefense request to remove him because of an alleged conflict ofinterest.</TEXT></DOC>
