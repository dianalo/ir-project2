Their presence, which highlights Brazil's once closecommercial ties with the regime of Saddam Hussein, is a&quot;political embarrassment&quot; to Brazil at a time when it isfirmly supporting the economic blockade of Iraq, ForeignMinister Jose Francisco Rezek has said.</LP><TEXT>   Brazilian officials acknowledge the engineers' presence inIraq, but contend they were operating without thegovernment's knowledge and say they have no specificinformation on their activities.   &quot;We don't have knowledge of the project,&quot; says ForeignMinistry spokesman Jose Vicente Pimentel. &quot;The Brazilians arethere on a strictly private basis.&quot; But Mr. Pimentel says the&quot;very special treatment&quot; the group apparently enjoyed,including luxurious but isolated living conditions, couldindicate a military project of some importance to Iraqiauthorities.   Brazilian press reports say the group was helping Iraq todevelop a short-range missile, possibly based on the Piranhaair-to-air missile that Brazil unsuccessfully sought todevelop, and to improve the performance of Iraq's Soviet-madeScud ballistic missiles. There is also speculation that thegroup was helping Iraq develop an earth-orbiting satellitewith military applications, and a rocket launcher. How farthese projects have advanced isn't clear.   Brazilian officials say that until recently Brazilianswere free to work in Iraq, but they should now comply withBrazil's adherence to the embargo imposed against Iraq, ceasetheir work and leave the country. But there hasn't been anyresponse to Mr. Rezek's appeal to their &quot;patriotism,&quot;officials say.   &quot;Brazilians, including retired military {officers}, arecivilians like any others {and} have the right to workwherever they want,&quot; says Aeronautics Minister SocratesMonteiro. &quot;But at a time when the Brazilian government isproclaiming its support for the United Nations-sponsoredeconomic blockade against Iraq, Brazilian citizens areobliged to comply with this blockade.&quot;   The group, said to total about 23 engineers, is apparentlyheaded by retired Maj. Brigadier Hugo de Oliveira Piva,former director of Brazil's Aerospace Technology Center. Theengineers are said to have been in Iraq for several months.Other foreign engineers, possibly Soviet, French and Chinese,were believed to be working on the same project.   Individuals familiar with Brazilian and Iraqi militaryresearch doubt that the project was carried out without theknowledge of Brazilian authorities because of Mr. Piva's highrank. &quot;It's conceivable that the government is right, but itseems implausible to me that Piva would go and embarrass hisgovernment to help Iraq with its missile technology,&quot; saysGary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on NuclearArms Control, which tracks chemical, nuclear and missiledevelopment in the Third World.   At the Aerospace Technology Center, according to DavidDantzic, a researcher at the Wisconsin Project, Mr. Piva wasin charge of converting the Sonda IV, Brazil's latest spacerocket, into a missile large enough to carry a nuclearwarhead, and of secretly making nuclear weapon material byenriching uranium. Since his retirement, Mr. Piva has headedan engineering consulting firm called HOP (after hisinitials) and based in Sao Jose dos Campos, near Sao Paulo.Repeated telephone calls to HOP's offices and to Mr. Piva'shome were unanswered. According to Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Piva wasrecently in Iraq, but Brazilian press reports quote friendsof Mr. Piva saying he is in Europe.   While officials say Mr. Piva -- described by one magazineas a &quot;Brazilian Werner von Braun&quot; -- has the right to markethis scientific abilities, the newspaper Jornal do Brasilcommented that passing on information about the Piranhamissile, whose development Brazil abandoned for lack offunds, would &quot;constitute a serious case of espionage.&quot; Maj.Teles Ribeiro, a spokesman for the Aeronautics Ministry, sayshe doubts the Piranha would interest Iraq because it's verysimilar to the Sidewinder, a U.S. missile that Iraq couldalready have obtained.   The engineers' presence in Iraq once again focusesattention on Brazil's controversial defense program. In onlytwo decades, Brazil has become the Third World's largest armsmaker and exporter, but has roused ire in Washington becauseof what the U.S. considers indiscriminate selling tocountries, such as Libya, that are linked to internationalterrorism. Also, Brazil's failure to sign either the nuclearnonproliferation treaty or the Missile Technology ControlRegime has led to suspicion that it has a program to producenuclear-weapons material.   Last summer, West German documents suggested that Brazilwas using for military purposes West German nucleartechnology acquired for the power industry, and was renegingon some inspection terms. Brazil denies that such diversionis taking place. More recently, the Washington-based Councilon Hemispheric Affairs and the Wisconsin Project charged thatefforts by Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace company, topurchase an IBM supercomputer should be blocked becauseBrazil could use the computer to develop -- and disseminate-- nuclear-weapons technology. And two weeks ago, WisconsinProject officials warned that Brazil could use rocket motortechnology it is acquiring from a group of European companiesto develop an intercontinental ballistic missile.   But Mr. Pimentel, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, deniesthe allegations. &quot;We're the bad guy that on top of burningrain forests also sells arms to Iraq,&quot; he says. &quot;But this badguy hasn't sold arms to Iraq in two years and hasn't evensold spare parts for a year because Iraq doesn't pay. We wereone of the first countries to say we would stick to U.N.resolution 661 despite its economic costs.&quot;   Indeed, until Iraq's economic difficulties, it enjoyed aprofitable relationship with Brazil. Until the embargo,Brazil imported up to 160,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day. Itpaid for some of the oil with Brazilian goods. Among otherthings, Jornal do Brasil recently alleged, Brazil's previousmilitary government provided Iraq with a small quantity ofenriched uranium.   During the Iran-Iraq war, Brazil sold Baghdad about $3billion of hardware, including armored vehicles, tanks,rocket launchers and ammunition. Iraq's financial straitsafter the war were a major reason why two of Brazil's largestarmsmakers, Avibras Aerospacial S.A. and Engesa, filed forprotection from creditors this year.   But the Kuwait crisis could revitalize the troubled armsindustry. Engesa hopes to sign a $2 billion contract tosupply Saudi Arabia with heavy armored vehicles.</TEXT></DOC>
