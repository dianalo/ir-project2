If true, the charges would be a shockingindictment of the morality of American foreign policy. Butthey are false.   ABC has conjured up an image of Cambodia run by a flawedbut legitimate central government, a government abandoned byits Vietnamese allies, whose only concern is to prevent thereturn of the Khmer Rouge. In this Cambodia, the Soviet Unionplays no role (the words &quot;Soviet Union&quot; are not utteredthroughout the broadcast) and Chinese backing for theresistance seems dwarfed by America's.</LP><TEXT>   Of course, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful military force ofperhaps 40,000 armed men, and it certainly aspires to returnto power. But it is far from likely to seize it soon. Whatstrength the Khmer Rouge does have it receives from peopletoo young to remember its crimes, who are attracted by thenationalist appeal of Khmer Rouge propaganda against theVietnamese.   But ABC pays little attention to the Vietnamese role inCambodia. Nothing is said about the two-centuries old historyof Vietnamese expansion at Cambodia's expense or about thethousands of Vietnamese political and military advisersremaining in Cambodia, or about the Vietnamese troops who arereportedly still fighting there.   All that ABC chooses to say about the Vietnamese role inCambodia is that it is over. On screen, former CIA directorWilliam Colby substantiates the program's bald assertion thatthe Vietnamese have withdrawn from Cambodia. Since he leftthe intelligence agency, Mr. Colby seems to have lost accessnot only to classified cable traffic but even to newspapers.How else could he have missed the report on the front page ofthe Feb. 23 issue of the New York Times, in which EastEuropean diplomats said that one month after Vietnam's muchpublicized withdrawal from Cambodia, resistance successes hadcompelled Hanoi to reinject thousands of elite Vietnamesetroops to save Cambodia's western provinces for Phnom Penh?   The Vietnamese communists did not just leave behind agovernment &quot;in their own image&quot; as ABC puts it. Hanoi retainscontrol over it. That is the function of some of thethousands of Vietnamese advisers who work in governmentministries and Phnom Penh's armed forces, as well as theVietnamese ambassador's daily meetings with the Cambodiancabinet.   Nor, in a documentary concerned with exposing an Americanaid program of $20 million per year, is there any discussionof the lavish arming of Phnom Penh by the Soviet Union --$350 million in 1987, according to the U.S. Arms Control andDisarmament Agency, and probably considerably more now. Thesefacts make nonsense of Peter Jenning's extraordinarystatement about the Phnom Penh regime: &quot;The Defense Ministerknows that his troops, alone, without the Vietnamese, have areal problem fighting forces supported by two superpowers:the United States and China.&quot;   ABC notes that the communist leaders in Phnom Penh areformer Khmer Rouge. But it does not tell us that they areunrepentant former Khmer Rouge, complicit in enormousatrocities. The character of Phnom Penh leaders explains theregime's &quot;mistreatment of its political opponents,&quot; as ABCdelicately puts it. Amnesty International, more candidly,reported thousands of political prisoners in Cambodia in1987. Amnesty has also expressed concern about &quot;systematictorture,&quot; and executions of prisoners without trial.   ABC suggests that the noncommunist Cambodian resistance isengaged in military cooperation with the Khmer Rouge. Afterbroadcasting a denial of any cooperation by Gen. SakSatsuyak, military commander of the noncommunist KhmerPeople's National Liberation Front, ABC attempts to discreditthe denial with a film of Khmer Rouge and noncommunistsoldiers fraternizing at the town of Thmar Puok, after itscapture by the noncommunists. This is evidence of nothing: Asone Cambodian witness, human rights activist Kassie Neou hastold me, the Khmer Rouge controlled some villages near thetown, and some of their soldiers passed through Thmar Puokafter it was taken. Khmer Rouge and noncommunist soldiersfrom the same regions may spontaneously fraternize, eventhough their commanders do not.   Eager to make a case of direct American support for theKhmer Rouge, ABC leaves its &quot;smoking gun&quot; for the lastsegment. After continuous denials from Assistant Secretary ofState Richard Solomon that the American-run Cambodian WorkingGroup in Thailand, which coordinates Western support for thenoncommunists, has any involvement with the Khmer Rouge, ABCcuts to a hidden camera film of another American, DennyLaine, at a Bangkok cafe. Mr. Jennings says: &quot;This man knowsthe details -- Special Forces Colonel Denny Laine -- formermilitary attache at the Bangkok embassy. When he was still onactive duty in Thailand, he was assigned to the UN borderrelief operation. Where he had good access to the KhmerRouge.&quot;   But Col. Laine's secondment to the UN border reliefoperation and his access to the Khmer Rouge had nothing to dowith the Cambodian working group or the American militaryrole in Cambodia, as Mr. Jennings insinuates. Col. Laine wasassigned to UNBRO's Displaced Persons Unit, set up by theThais in response to foreign concern about human rightsabuses in the refugee camps. His visits to Khmer Rouge camps,like those of his fellow officers from Britain, Sweden andAustralia, were not connected with covert U.S. aid to theKhmer Rouge, but with trying to protect the human rights ofcivilians in Khmer Rouge camps. The deceitful insinuationabout Col. Laine's mission is a telling reflection on ABC'sprogram.   America's Cambodia policy is not, as ABC suggests, theBush administration's alone; nor has it been dictated by theneeds of alliance with China. The policy has bipartisancongressional support, most strikingly from Rep. StephenSolarz (D., N.Y.), one of the harshest critics of the Bushadministration's China policy.   How could ABC air such a misleading account of Americanpolicy in Cambodia? Part of the answer is the attitude ofproducer Leslie Cockburn, whose track record at &quot;CBS Reports&quot;and PBS's &quot;Frontline,&quot; was that of a committed leftideologue. But the blame here must be spread more widely, asMrs. Cockburn worked here in close cooperation with executiveproducer Tom Yellin and anchor Peter Jennings.   Hanoi's leaders are hoping that a propaganda campaign bytheir friends in the West will pressure Western governmentsto accept the Phnom Penh regime. Hanoi's hopes were realizedin Britain after the screening of John Pilger's &quot;Year 10&quot; onITV. It hopes for as much from tonight's program at ABC.   ---   Mr. Morris is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard's RussianResearch Center and is completing a book on the origins ofthe current war in Cambodia.</TEXT></DOC>
