Box 11430, Lexington, Kentucky 40575 hasfiled a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.326 (aircoursesand belt haulage entries) to its North Branch Mine (Potomac Division) (I.D.No. 46-01309) located in Grant County, West Virginia. The petition is filedunder section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows: 1. The petition concerns the requirement that entries used as intake andreturn aircourses be separated from belt haulage entries, and that belthaulage entries not be used to ventilate active working places. 2. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to use belt haulage entriesas intake aircourses in continuous and longwall mining sections. In addition,an early-warning fire detection system would be installed in the belt entryas follows: (a) A low-level carbon monoxide (CO) detection system would be installedin straight Mains, the rehabilitation belt entries, and at each belt driveand tailpiece located in the intake aircourse. The low-level CO systemwould be capable of giving warning of a fire for a minimum of four hoursshould the power fail; a visual alert signal would be activated when theCO level is 10 parts per million (ppm) above the ambient level and an audiblesignal would sound at 15 ppm above the ambient level. All persons wouldbe withdrawn to a safe area at 10 ppm and evacuated at 15 ppm. The CO systemwould be capable of identifying any activated sensor and for monitoringelectrical continuity and and detecting electrical malfunctions; (b) The CO monitoring system would initiate the fire alarm signals at anattended surface location. This reponsible person would have two-way communicationswith all personnel who may be endangered and can hear or observe the signalsand take appropriate action immediately. The responsible person would betrained in the operation of the CO monitoring system and in the properprocedures to follow in the event of an emergency or malfunction. In addition,the detector located at or near the section loading point would activatewhen the CO monitoring system initiates the fire alarm signals and wouldgive a warning that could be heard on the working section; (c) The CO monitoring system would be visually examined, at least onceeach coal-producing shift, and tested for functional operation weekly,to ensure the monitoring system is functioning properly. The monitoringsystem would be calibrated with known concentrations of CO and air mixturesat least monthly; (d) If at any time the CO monitoring system or any portion of the systemis deengerized for reasons such as routine maintenance or failure of asensor unit, the belt conveyor may continue to operate, provided the affectedportion of the belt conveyor entry would be continuously patrolled andmonitored for CO by a qualified person using hand-held CO detecting devices;(e) The details for the fire detection system would be included as a partof the Ventilation System and Methane and Dust Control plan. The DistrictManager may require additional carbon monoxide monitors to be installedas part of said plan to ensure the safety of the miners. 3. This plan would increase the quantity of air that can be supplied tothe face areas, and thereby provide increased protection to the minersagainst hazards created by accumulation of methane and other harmful gases,as well as respirable dust. Also, by using the belt entry as an intake,the velocity of air in the belt entry would be increased. This would providemore positive ventilation and reduce the possibility of methane accumulationin the belt entry. 4. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments  </ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
