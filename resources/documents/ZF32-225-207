Thisactivity was a facilitation of the business affairs of the Coalition to StopU.S.andP;  Intervention in the Middle East and therefore in violation of Section97.113(a).&quot;andM;The stations receiving the letters were told that they had 10 days to respondand then the FCC would &quot;determine what, if any, enforcement action isrequired to insure current and future rule compliance.&quot;andM;Freeman confirmed to Newsbytes that the citation letters were sent and saidthat three stations, including the originator WA3QNS, have been fined fortheir part in the dissemination of the material.andP;  Freeman explained that themessage asked recipients of the transmission to call a `900' telephone numberto &quot;register your voice&quot; in opposition to the war.andP;  The use of the 900 numberwhich brings revenue to the Coalition makes this message one which clearlypromotes business activity, according to Freeman.andM;Freeman also agreed with Clark's contention that the FCC letter holds thestation operator responsible for the content of material passed throughpacket switches.andP;  Freeman said: &quot;Amateurs asked to be allowed to provideunattended service and that was granted.andP;  This granting, however, does notremove from the station operator responsibility for material broadcast fromthe station.&quot;andM;Clark's Internet posting stated that his: &quot;W3IWI mail switch handles about10,000 messages per month automatically.andP;  There is no way that I can vouchfor every bit that passes through.&quot; Clark said that, if a policy of punishingretransmitters rather than just the originator is allowed to stand, it&quot;effectively kills packet radio.&quot;andM;In earlier comments to Newsbytes, Jim Warren, chairman of the upcoming SanFrancisco conference on Communications, Freedom andamp; Privacy, said that is ananalogy between the actions of packet switch operators and computer BBSsysops and that rulings that hold any operator liable for content of messagesmay have far-reaching implications.andP;  Freeman agreed with this analysis sayingthat he was sure that the letter would cause comment and, hopefully, a moreprecise understanding of the responsibilities of system operators.andM;(Barbara E.
