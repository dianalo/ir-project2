In a rush to complete its work before the recess that beginsFriday, Congress tackles a full plate of appropriations bills thisweek with the Senate trying to produce a defense package thatserves as a counterbalance to the House version.   In final action late Thursday, the Democratic-controlled Houseapproved a $295 billion defense bill that severely curtailsproduction of the B-2 stealth bomber, slashes $1.8 billion from theStar Wars budget and restores two planes _ the F-14D Tomcat jetfighter and V-22 Osprey _ that Bush planned to kill.   The last cut came as Alabama Republican William Dickinson joinedforces with Massachusetts liberal Democrat Barney Frank andsucceeded in eliminating all $100 million earmarked for theMidgetman missile.   ``Yesterday was not the House's most memorable moment,'' Bushtold reporters Friday. ``But we're going to keep fighting on forwhat we believe in.''   The president said he is counting on the Senate to produce abill that keeps White House defense priorities in order. Thechairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democrat Sam Nunnof Georgia, has given every indication he will do that.   ``We are watching the strategic position of the administrationunwind step by step on the floor of the House,'' Nunn said Thursdaynight as the House stripped all money for the Midgetman. ``It isimportant that we not emasculate this program.''   ``If the Senate does not come out with a reasonable budget onall strategic programs, then we are going to be going to conferencein a hopeless situation,'' he added.   To date, the Senate has followed the administration's line,approving an amendment that largely endorses the B-2 bomber programand makes a modest cut of $300 million from Bush's $4.7 billion B-2request.   On Thursday, the Senate narrowly turned aside an amendment tofreeze research and development of the Star Wars anti-missileshield. Bush has requested $4.9 billion for the Star Wars program.   Bush also expressed the administration's desire to work with thechairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Democrat Les Aspinof Wisconsin, who ``does not want to see the defense bill gutted,''according to the president.   Prior to committee action on the bill, Aspin urged hisDemocratic and Republican colleagues to accept Defense SecretaryDick Cheney's procurement budget without any add-ons.   ``While the budget may not be perfect, it's a darn good product_ especially given the 39 days Dick Cheney had to put ittogether,'' Aspin had told the procurement subcommittee, whichnarrowly accepted the chairman's argument.   But shortly after the House voted 261-162 to adopt the defensebill, Aspin assessed the situation.   ``We got a Michael Dukakis defense bill,'' the WisconsinDemocrat told reporters, referring to the Massachusetts governorwho lost the 1988 presidential election to Bush.   ``No Midgetman. No rail MX ... Big cuts in SDI, and slow up theB-2 bomber,'' Aspin said in reference to Dukakis' campaign pledges.   House and Senate conferees will meet after the August recess tocraft a final defense bill, which also includes $10 billion for theDepartment of Energy for a $305 billion package.   Another Armed Services panel member, Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.,said too much was being made of the House version which was merelya ``position in the process.''   The final defense bill will include some restrictions on the B-2but not the version adopted by the House, plus ``a flattening outof SDI money and resurrection of a small amount of funding forMidgetman,'' Spratt said.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said House-Senate conferees``could alter on the margins the decisions made yesterday, but thebroad outline of these decisions will survive.''   In other action this week:   _The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Tuesday onthe nomination of William Lucas as the nation's chief civil rightsenforcer. Bush's choice for the post has come under attack from theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People andother civil rights groups, who complain that Lucas lacks experience.   _The Senate considers a compromise savings and loan bailout billthat would balloon the federal budget deficit. A House-Senateconference committee finished work last week on the plan that wouldinvolve spending $166 billion, including interest, over the next 10years _ the vast majority of it from taxpayers. The conferencecommittee rejected Bush's complex plan to exclude $50 billion inrescue spending from the deficit, and senators warn thatRepublicans could block the arrangement in the Senate.   _The House and Senate consider bills expanding the government'sborrowing authority through Oct. 31 by $70 billion. The amount is atemporary extension of the $2.8 trillion debt ceiling.</TEXT></DOC>
