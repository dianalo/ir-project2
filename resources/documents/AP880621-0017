Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke said Monday thatbanks that lend conservatively more easily pull themselves out oftrouble than institutions with ``overly aggressive behavior.''   ``Growth for growth's sake, or growth without the resources toback it up, is a highly risky strategy because it leaves the bankexposed when the economy turns down,'' Clarke said in a speechMonday night to the American Bankers Association's Stonier GraduateSchool of Banking in Newark, Del.   ``In other words, when the economic tide goes out, you find outwho is swimming naked,'' Clarke said in a text of his speech thatwas released in Washington.   Clarke's comments came as the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency, which regulates 4,500 nationally chartered banks,released a report showing that problem banks that later recover aremore than twice as likely to comply with the instructions of bankexaminers as are institutions that fail.   The report found that poor policies, planning and managementwere about as likely to play a significant role in the failure ofclosed banks as in the decline of banks that later recovered _ 90percent and 88 percent respectively.   However, the ``rehabilitated'' banks were much more likely to atleast partially comply with regulators' orders, 86 percent versus41 percent, after financial weaknesses are first spotted.   The recovered banks were also more likely to change chiefexecutive officers than failed banks, 90 percent versus 76 percent.   Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office, said bankexaminers have taken note of the study's findings by looking moreclosely at the management practices of banks, even if they havegood earnings.   But she said Clarke believes the comptroller's office does notneed additional enforcement power to reduce bank failures. She saidthe agency prefers to work with bankers to improve their practicesrather than adopt a punitive attitude.   The study is being issued as bank and savings institutionsfailures have hit a post-Depression high. A record 184 commercialbanks _ half of them in the oil-drilling states of Texas, Louisianaand Oklahoma _ were shut down by regulators last year. Failuresthis year are running at about the same rate.   Many Sandamp;L failures in particular have been attributed to``high-flyers'' who pay high interest rates to attract deposits bymail from all over the country and then sink the money in high-riskreal estate deals and oil drilling ventures that later go bust.   In January, Clarke released the first phase of the study,examining 171 nationally chartered banks that failed between 1979and 1987. It showed that in most cases it took a combination of badmanagement and a poor economy to cause a bank to fail. Only 7percent of the failures were attributed to the economy alone.   The findings raise questions about how banks outside theSouthwest will fare if the national economy enters a recession nextyear or in 1990 as most economists expect.   The second phase of the study, released Monday, compared failedbanks to 38 healthy and 51 ``rehabilitated'' institutions of aboutthe same size and in roughly the same areas of the country.   Half of the healthy banks studied were in regions with depressedeconomies, but they weathered the storm, the study said, because``these bankers emphasized profitability and conservative lending,even at the expense of growth.''   The study said 74 percent of the failed banks pursued excessivehigh-growth strategies, while only 16 percent of the healthy banksand 40 percent of the declining banks that later recovered had suchstrategies.   In fact, all of the banks that dug themselves out of a holeabandoned fast growth on their way back up, the study showed.</TEXT></DOC>
