Gen. Prosper Avril.   Rockefeller Guerre, leader of the small Union of DemocraticPatriots party, was arrested at his home in the northern suburb ofDelmas and taken to police headquarters in Port-au-Prince, said hiswife, Huguette Guerre.   ``They said that this act was part of a round-up, that my husbandwas not the only one concerned,'' Mrs. Guerre told The AssociatedPress.   Independent station Radio Metropole said police confirmed thearrest.   Police did not say how long he would be held or why he wasarrested.   Guerre and opposition leaders Sylvio Claude and Louis Dejoie in ajoint statement Friday called for a general strike Wednesday andThursday which they said ``will have the force of a referendumagainst Avril.''   The three said they would boycott Avril's ``democratic forum'' onThursday in which government and political leaders are to discussthe powers of an electoral board that is to supervise futureelections.   They say Haiti's constitution already provides for anindependently appointed Electoral Council with total control overelections.   ``The Avril government is in the process of establishing adictatorship. It intends to arrest all leaders who are opposed tohis regime,'' Claude said after hearing of Guerre's arrest.   Conservative politician Hubert de Ronceray and the AutonomousCentral of Haitian Workers, the largest union, announced theirsupport for the strike. The union has called two successful strikesin the last three months.   ``The arrest (of Guerre) is outrageous and is an indication ofAvril's Duvalierist commitmen,'' Dejoie said in a telephoneinterview from his home in Puerto Rico.   Avril came to power in a Sept. 17 coup by rank-and-file soldierswho ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, demanding a return todemocratic rule. Namphy came to power in 1986 when former dictatorJean-Claude Duvalier fled to France.</TEXT></DOC>
