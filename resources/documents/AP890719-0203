(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker refused to answerquestions Wednesday in the federal tax evasion trial of two formeraides on grounds he might incriminate himself.   Bakker appeared only because his attorney failed to quash asubpoena compelling him to testify for the defense. He entered U.S.District Court before the jury returned from an afternoon break inthe trial of James and David Taggart.   David Taggart, 32, was Bakker's top personal aide, and JamesTaggart, 35, was the television ministry's interior decorator. TheTaggarts are accused of evading $487,000 in federal income taxesduring their years at PTL. Prosecutors say the two men diverted $1.1million in ministry funds to their own use.   Both were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at the televisionministry following Bakker's resignation in March 1987 followingrevelations of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.      Bakker and Richard Dortch, his former top deputy at thenow-bankrupt television ministry, are to go on trial here Aug. 28 on24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy.   As defense attorney Ben Cotten attempted to ask Bakker a seriesof questions Wednesday, the PTL ministry's founder took the FifthAmendment.   ``What was the PTL's policy on cash advance?'' Cotten asked.   ``On the advice of my attorney, I decline to answer on thegrounds my answer may tend to incriminate me,'' Bakker responded.   Questions about PTL policy on blank checks and about who hiredthe Taggarts in 1983 brought the same reply.   Asked if he would give the same answer to other questions, Bakkersaid, ``Yes.''   Prosecutor David Brown then asked Bakker whether he knew thedefendants, and asked him about David Taggart's employment contractand a bonus payment to him. Bakker again refused to answer.   Judge Robert Potter then released Bakker, saying, ``This courtwill not force him to testify.''   Asked later if he wanted to comment on his reasons for nottestifying, Bakker replied, ``No, the judge has asked that there beno comment.''   Bakker, accompanied by attorneys Harold Bender and George T.Davis, left in their car. Davis said in a telephone interview thatBakker's refusing to testify Wednesday did not mean Bakker would nottestify at his own trial.   Testifying earlier in the day, James Taggart described himself asan artist with no knowledge of several questionable financialtransactions mentioned during the trial.   ``A lot of these mistakes I'm learning in this courtroom,'' hesaid. ``I'm under a microscope and I'm learning.''   Taggart showed jurors large photos of some of his work. Heappeared relaxed and confident as he recalled the first time Bakkernoticed his design flair, at a party he and his brother held attheir house in 1981.   ``The interior was very theatrical and dramatic,'' Taggart said.   Taggart said he almost immediately became involved in theinterior design of PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat.   He said one of his first big assignments was decorating Bakker'svacation home in the Highland Beach, Fla., and that Bakker had onlyone request.   ``As soon I walk into it, I want to know James Taggart did it,''he recalled Bakker telling him. ``I want the theatrics and flair ofJames Taggart.''   By 1984, Taggart was chief interior designer.   He testified that Bakker placed great demands on him and put nolimits on how much money he could spend.   ``He trusted me,'' Taggart said. ``He confided in me.''</TEXT></DOC>
