Tokyo was one of the few to record a gain, while London eased and Frankfurt reversed its rally.    Tokyo share prices closed higher in moderate trading, helped by strength in food companies and retailers.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which declined 14.45 points Tuesday, rose 207.09 to close at 26864.09. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 11.57 to 2162.46. First section volume was estimated at one billion shares, up from 600 million a day earlier.    In early trading Thursday, the Nikkei had slipped slightly to 26859.00.    Retailers were higher on the back of Tuesday's report that consumer spending in Japan rose an inflation-adjusted 5.8% in February from a year earlier. Food issues were higher in part because of favorable reports concerning recently developed drugs by two food companies, Ajinomoto and Meiji Milk.    Traders said the market also got a boost from the perception among many investors that Japan's major brokerages will support the market any time the Nikkei index falls too far from the 27000 level.    One trader said the consumer spending report was encouraging both because it put to rest the notion that spending by high-income households is likely to slow soon, and showed spending by wage-earning families was up 4.4%.    Among retailers, Jusco gained 30 yen to 2,110 ($16.97), while Ajinomoto eased from its best levels but still closed 60 higher at 3,460 on reports the company and a cancer research center were granted a U.S. patent on an anti-cancer agent. One trader noted that many other food companies are conducting research into the kind of biotechnology that yielded Ajinomoto's medicine.    Among other food issues, Kikkoman was up 70 at 1,260, and Ezaki Glico rose 30 to 1,300.    Oil shares were sharply lower, as fears of further hostilities in the Persian Gulf eased. Showa Shell declined 20 to 1,200, Toa Nenryo fell 40 to 1,850 and Teikoku Oil was down 34 at 855.    Bridgestone surged 110 to 1,520. Traders said though there wasn't any news to affect the issue, it was aided by continuing interest in the U.S. marketing capability it got in acquiring Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber.    London share prices ended weaker, carried lower by a lack of buying interest and declines on Wall Street.    The Financial Times 30-share index finished down 10.3 points at 1419.4. Volume was a light 451.4 million shares, up from 419.4 million a day earlier. The 100-share index fell 12.1 to 1786.8.    Equities traded lower in a narrow range throughout the morning session, amid a lack of fresh news to move the market. Sentiment was hurt by Wall Street's turnaround late Tuesday from solid gains to a modest loss. Shares eased further on New York's opening with fresh losses and on slightly disturbing news about U.S. inflation trends. The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5% in March, the largest monthly gain since January 1987.    The market didn't react to news the U.K. public sector borrowing requirement, the most widely used measure of a government deficit or surplus, showed a deficit of about #3.79 billion ($7.18 billion) in March, compared with a revised surplus of #438 million in February and a deficit of #3.29 billion in March 1987. The data were in line with market expectations.    Allied-Lyons rose 4 pence to 409 ($7.74) on brisk volume, prompting speculation that Australia's Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. could be adding to its previously disclosed 7% stake in Allied-Lyons, dealers said.    Storehouse jumped 12 to 287, as unconfirmed rumors circulated that a takeover bid would be launched Thursday.    Burmah Oil eased 6 to 560 on profit-taking after this week's brisk rise on analysts' recommendations.    Sun Life Assurance Society rose strongly, up 45 at #11.25 ($21.29) on market rumors of a takeover bid, analysts said.    Share prices in Frankfurt closed broadly lower in calm trading.    Brokers traced the decline to rising interest rates, pushed up by weak U.S. bond prices, a technical correction following Tuesday's rally, and worries over the conflict in the Persian Gulf. The gulf tensions helped keep the dollar stable, but brokers said this strength is artificial and doesn't do away with the unit's fundamental weakness.    Electrical and automobile shares had the largest losses, while machinery issues were mostly higher.    Computer maker Nixdorf continued to plunge, following Tuesday's report that under new West German accounting rules, its 1987 earnings per share were lower than expected. It fell 14.80 marks to 509.20 ($305.83), giving up 5% in two days.    Siemens, West Germany's largest electronics group, slipped 4.20 to 349.50, while AEG, supported by Daimler-Benz's tender offer of 200 marks a share, was steady at 205. Daimler dropped 6 to 639. Auto maker Bayerische Motoren Werke also fell 6 to 515, while Volkswagen dropped 5 to 241.    But machinery stock Linde added 3 to 609, and MAN gained 1 to 171, supported by positive reports from the major industrial fair in Hanover.    Stocks closed lower in Paris, Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam; mixed in Milan; and higher in Stockholm.    In Paris, the decline across a broad front came in calm trading, pushed lower by technical factors and Wall Street's weakness. In Zurich, investors retreated to the sidelines, awaiting market direction. Trading in Brussels was moderate, but early gains were lost after release of the U.S. consumer price index, renewing inflation fears, which also affected Amsterdam. In Stockholm, equities broke a three-session losing streak.    Share prices closed higher in Singapore and Seoul, and ended lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei, Manila and Wellington.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                    % This                                Apr 19    Apr 18    Year    U.S. ....................... 237.4     238.6   +  3.5    Britain .................... 540.8     537.7   +  4.8    Canada ..................... 369.8     369.7   +  5.4    Japan ..................... 1273.2    1276.1   + 24.5    France ..................... 310.0     310.8   +  7.4    Germany .................... 169.8     168.5   +  8.5    Hong Kong ................. 1855.4    1826.7   + 12.8    Switzerland ................ 150.0     150.6   +  6.6    Australia .................. 289.2     288.7   + 11.5    World index ................ 455.4     455.9   + 11.6</TEXT></DOC>
