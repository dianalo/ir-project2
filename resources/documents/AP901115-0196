Gorbachev's poweris ebbing, leading U.S. officials to open lines of communication toother levels of the Soviet system.   Some U.S. officials are searching for ways to shore upGorbachev's beleaguered regime, while at the same time trying toposition the United States for a possible realignment of politicalpower in the Soviet Union.   ``The evidence is clear that power is now moving out of thecentral government to other levels, or even out of governmentaltogether,'' said one U.S. official who agreed to discuss theissue on condition his name not be used. ``The focus now is in therepublics.''   Another official said the administration is not worried - atleast not at this point - about the Soviets' ability to live up totheir international agreements or about any desire to change theirstrategic posture.   International confidence in the Kremlin's peaceful intentionswill be on display this week when President Bush, Gorbachev and theleaders of 32 other nations gather for the signing of a long-soughtagreement to reduce conventional forces in Europe and end themilitary faceoff that divided East and West throughout the ColdWar.   The Bush administration doesn't doubt the Soviet regime's will,one source explained, but added: ``The danger is that Gorbachev maylose the ability to make decisions and carry them through.''   That official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe United States is now working with reform leaders in the Russianfederation, the Baltics and elsewhere, partly in hopes of shoringup Gorbachev's political standing at home.   ``By helping the reform movement at various levels, we helpGorbachev,'' the official said. ``It gives us other access, moreinformation about what's going on, plus it's neutral-to-beneficialfor Gorbachev because we're supporting Gorbachev. It doesn'tundermine him.''   Fourteen of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics havedeclared sovereignty or, in a few cases, their intention to seekcomplete independence from Soviet rule. Boris Yeltsin, president ofthe Russian federation, which accounts for roughly half the Sovietpopulation, is threatening to institute his own reforms that couldestablish an economic system independent of the central government.   The deteriorating Soviet economy is at the root of much of thepublic's unhappiness with the central government.   In one sense, the shift of power away from the center ``is quiteconsistent with democratization,'' which the U.S. government hassupported wholeheartedly, one analyst observed. But he added thatit complicates Western efforts to support reform.   ``We recognize that imbalances and uncertainty can lead toinstability,'' the source said. ``There is a potential for a veryhigh level of frustration, public indignation, a volatile situationif economic deterioration continues.''   Demonstrators from both the left and right showed their angerwith Gorbachev and the economic calamity in Revolution Daydemonstrations Nov. 7 marking the 73rd anniversary of the RussianRevolution.   John Hardt, a specialist in Soviet affairs at the Library ofCongress, said Gorbachev does not appear in imminent danger. Heretains control of the police, the military and the KGB, the secretpolice agency responsible for state security, Hrdt noted.   ``The levers of power are quite clearly in Gorbachev's hands,''he said, adding that the Soviet leader was able to implementmassive military reductions and set a new course for Soviet policyin the Middle East, neither of which could be expected to garnerstrong support from the military establishment or governmentbureaucracy.   But Hardt acknowledged that Gorbachev is threatened by crisesrippling through Soviet society and that his popularity inside hisown country is extremely low compared to his status elsewhere inthe world.   ``Gorbachev's power is becoming more diffuse,'' said a StateDepartment official, also speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Butwe want to be careful not to sell him short. He's shown he canaccomplish a great deal, even against tremendous inertia andresistance.''   ``Time will tell,'' the source said, ``whether this master ofthe old political system can master the new'' one he has installed.   A source familiar with foreign policy strategy discussions atthe top levels of the administration said there does not appear tobe an imminent threat to Gorbachev.   ``There is no apparent challenger, no alternative, no reason toexpect military intervention,'' the source said. ``What is morelikely is that it will become harder for him to exert influence.   ``To a degree, that's a natural result of increasing pluralism,and we applaud that. But what's difficult is the institutionalstructures have not had much time to develop, and that makes for anunstable situation.''   The United States, several sources said, is continuing tosupport Gorbachev while trying to establish contacts at otherlevels, particularly where it can encourage economic reform andcreation of market forces.   ``Arms control agreements still have to be negotiated at thecentral government level,'' one source explained. ``But we canprovide technical cooperation and support economic activity at bothlevels.''   The Soviet republics are in some ways similar to the states ofthe United States in that they have government structures thatmirror the one in Moscow. Under Gorbachev's predecessors, theKremlin dictated practically all policy to the republics, but itclearly can no longer do that. Today, under pressure fromnationalists and malcontents in almost every republic, it isstruggling to keep the union from splintering along republic orethnic lines while it negotiates a new balance of power between thecenter and the republics.   The shift in power complicates the effort to back Gorbachev andhis reforms, one source said. ``No one has much experience inmaking changes of this sort.''   ``Gorbachev's ace in the hole is that he is the only Sovietleader who has made it on the world stage,'' said another official.``True, that doesn't put food on the table, but many realize theyneed the West if they're going to improve and modernize their ownsituation.   ``Much of the Soviet leadership recognizes this, even if theydon't like it. So Gorbachev has a strong card to play in foreignrelations.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance Sunday Nov 18</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
