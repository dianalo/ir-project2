At noon EDT, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season wascentered near 17.5 degrees north latitude and 59.5 degrees westlongitude, or 425 miles east of San Juan, Puerto Rico, rushingwestward across the Atlantic at 20 mph.   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Lesser Antilles fromGuadeloupe to the U.S. Virgin Islands, said the National HurricaneCenter in Coral Gables. A hurricane watch was in effect for PuertoRico, Dominica and Martinique.   ``It's very warm water. There's not anything in the atmosphereto cause it to break up, so basically it looks good for furtherdevelopment,'' said meteorologist Jesse Moore. ``Right now, it'saway from any land area, but it could affect the easternmostislands of the Lesser Antilles within the next 6 to 12 hours.''   Rainfall of 5-10 inches and tides 3 to 5 feet above normal werepossible.   South Florida could be in danger in three or four days fromDean, which is called a Cape Verde storm because it formed off thewest coast of Africa.   ``When we see a hurricane like that we realize that it has thepotential to move all the way across the Atlantic and threaten thesoutheastern United States,'' said hurricane center forecasterMiles Lawrence.   Chantal, the first hurricane of the season, was downgraded to atropical depression Tuesday night after hitting Texas near HighIsland, midway between Galveston and Port Arthur. It was blamed forat least two deaths.   Dean began Monday as the fifth tropical depression of theseason. It became a named storm Monday night when its winds reached39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes when their top sustainedwinds hit 74 mph.   Three other depressions have grown into named storms since theseason began June 1.</TEXT></DOC>
