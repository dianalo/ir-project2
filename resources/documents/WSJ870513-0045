The index shot up 76.46 points to close at 1773.81, up from Monday's 1697.35. The index plunged 28.46 Monday, 66.29 Saturday and 49.39 Friday.    Tuesday, 7.5 billion Taiwan dollars, or the equivalent of $231.2 million, of shares were traded, down from Monday's 8.1 billion Taiwan dollars.    Trading has been active since October, when the index breached the 1000-point barrier for the first time.    Tuesday's activity was tied to ample liquidity and low interest rates, analysts said. Savings interest rates stand at 5% for one-year time deposits, down from 6.25% last year.    Speculation is &quot;rampant lately, as we have too much money chasing too few shares,&quot; a broker said.    However, the activity also reflected investor confidence in the economy, analysts said. Last week the government said it expected the economy to achieve 8% growth this year, compared with last year's 10.5%. </TEXT></DOC>
