This methodis effective in load calculation for any input (meteorological) condition.Moreover, this method has enabled the detail theoretical calculationfor the cases where the heat intake by radiation through windows or lightingis stored in the building and thereafter acts as a cooling load, whereroom temperature is varied by intermittent operation of a conditioner,and for the stored heat at rising-up in the variation. Conventionally,such calculation could be made only by a brief estimation method. Thisis contributed to the introduction of weighted factors and computer calculation.In Japan, this method was named a dynamic calculation method, and theprogram HASP/ACLD. The practical application began in 1971. Various manualcalculation methods conventionally used have been considerably advanced.An calculation method in correspondence to the Energy Conservation law,and a manual calculation method based on the dynamic method have beengiven.
