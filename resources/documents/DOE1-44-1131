<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-1131 </DOCNO><TEXT>Papers are presented on high average power commercial excimer lasers,inductively stabilized excimer lasers, large excimer lasers for fusion,and advances in excimer laser lithography. Also considered are laserphotochemical vapor deposition, an excimer laser etching mechanism usinglaser-induced fluorescence measurements, the generation of subnanosecondexcimer laser pulses by means of stimulated Brillouin scattering in liquids,and excited state excimer spectroscopy. Other topics include amplificationin a XeCl excimer gain module of 200-fsec UV pulses derived from a collidingpulse mode-locked laser system, a multikilojoule narrowband XeCl laser,a long-pulse e-beam pumped excimer laser, and high order multiphotonprocesses observed with subpicosecond excimer lasers.</TEXT></DOC>
