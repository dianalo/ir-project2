(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A $65 million navigation satellitewas rocketed into orbit, joining the Air Force's network ofspacecraft that guide bombers, warships, missiles and ground troopswith precision accuracy.   The fifth of a series of Navstar spacecraft was boosted intospace Monday by a Delta 2 rocket. The satellite settled into anorbit reaching 11,000 miles high.   ``Everything appears to have gone very well with the flight,''said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.   After about a month of checkout by ground stations, the newNavstar will join the four earlier spacecraft in providing U.S. andallied military units information that allows them to pinpointtheir locations within 50 feet anywhere on Earth in any weather.   Planes, ships, submarines, tanks and field soldiers can tune inon the network's positioning radio signals with receivers as smallas a hand-held telephone. In some places the signals can beaccurate within 10 feet.   The 3,675-pound satellites also keep track of the speed ofmilitary vehicles within a fraction of a mile per hour and tellthem the time, accurate to within a millionth of a second.   Military users receive information from a coded channel.Civilian users such as operators of boats and private aircraft alsohave access to the system, but they monitor an open channelproviding less accurate information, to within 300 feet of theirposition.   Users must wait until one or more of the satellites is withinradio range, leaving occasional gaps in coverage. There will be nointerruption when the Air Force completes the 21-satellite networkby 1992. Launches are planned about once every two months.</TEXT></DOC>
