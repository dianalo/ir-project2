Hance Jr., principal accounting officer, as chief financial officer in the latest management reshuffling resulting from its takeover of First RepublicBank Corp.    Mr. Hance, 43 years old, succeeds Timothy P. Hartman, who was transferred to Dallas to become vice chairman of the new NCNB Texas National Bank. Mr. Hartman and Mr. Hance were among the chief architects of the First RepublicBank deal, which involved creative tax strategies, analysts said.    NCNB recently created NCNB Texas National when it agreed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to acquire certain assets and liabilities of the failed First RepublicBank of Dallas for about $210 million. The agreement gives NCNB 20% of the new institution, and the FDIC the remaining 80%.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NCNB closed at $27.875, unchanged. NCNB already has sent five of its top 10 executives to NCNB Texas National, and is expected to make a number of other senior management changes to accommodate the merger.    Mr. Hance joined NCNB in March 1987 and since then has been in charge of the bank holding company's financial division, reporting directly to Mr. Hartman. In the six years prior to joining NCNB, Mr. Hance was an audit partner at Price Waterhouse, in charge of the NCNB account. Analysts said Mr. Hance had been a low profile executive at NCNB but that his appointment makes sense because of his long experience with NCNB's accounting department.    First RepublicBank hasn't any connection with First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco. </TEXT></DOC>
