The recommendations, announced by a White House task forceheaded by Vice President Dan Quayle, are intended to helpmaintain U.S. leadership in biotechnology. A report releasedby the task force predicted that the annual U.S. market forbiotechnology products will expand to $50 billion in nineyears from some $2 billion currently.</LP><TEXT>   The panel recommended a more aggressive federal role inidentifying and financing biotechnology research that couldspin off new products in agriculture, medicine, energy andenvironmental protection. But otherwise, the panel stressed afree-market approach to attracting capital and scientifictalent to emerging biotechnology industries.   The task force urged a faster transfer of technology fromthe federal laboratories to the marketplace by expanding useof legal incentives that reward federal employees for thecommercialization of their inventions.   While basic sciences should continue to have top priorityin federal spending on biotechnology research, theadministration should pay more attention to promotingscientific work aimed at finding commercial applications ofscientific breakthroughs, the panel said. There was no hintin the report, however, that the government would raise moremoney to promote such a shift in emphasis.   The panel also urged the administration to continueopposing congressional attempts to reduce the pharmaceuticalindustry's incentives to develop cures for rare diseasesunder the Federal Drug Administration's Orphan Drug Program.The program gives a company that develops such a drug anexclusive right to market the product for seven years. Somelawmakers believe it is a give-away to industry, but thePharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group, saysthe program has led to the development of 50 effective drugsto cure rare diseases in the last eight years.   The panel also opposes legislation to create newregulatory structures for emerging biotechnology industries.</TEXT></DOC>
