Most coalitions showed incomplete osseous bridging.CT disclosed talar dysplasia, deformity of the tarsal sinus, and narrowingof the joint space. A posterior aspect of the subtalar joint was thesite of involvement in over half of the cases. Twelve children with normalplain films and no subtalar joint motion had only subtle CT changes ofjoint narrowing. To date, nonosseus, fibrous coalition has been confirmedsurgically in six. CT is essential in the evaluation of children suspectedof having subtalar coalition.</TEXT></DOC>
