MehilosandM;The Application System/400, IBM's line of midrange computers, has thepotential to greatly enhance PC environments.andP;  Rich in PC connectivityoptions, the AS/400 line not only allows corporate PC users to tap the powerof the AS/400, but it also creates an environment in which the two computerplatforms can work effectively together.andM;Vertical-market AS/400 software programs, from IBM and third-partydevelopers, have largely fueled the popularity of the AS/400.andP;  These verticalapplications include hotel management, law, manufacturing and construction.andM;An AS/400 system serves as a possible upgrade path for companies that haveoutgrown IBM's System/3X minicomputers.andP;  First time buyers considering anAS/400 system should make sure that an AS/400 software application isavailable that is ideal for their corporate needs.andM;Buyers within mainstream corporate environments should seriously considerLANs with powerful 25MHz or 33MHz PC servers before solely investing in anAS/400 setup.andM;Many companies use the AS/400 for primary business applications such asaccounting or billing, and use PCs for desktop applications such as wordprocessing and spreadsheets.andP;  In these companies, the AS/400 is likely to bepart of a network that can link to remote company locations, which enables PCusers to tap into the AS/400 network.andM;Several connectivity options exist for linking PCs to an AS/400.andM;Typically, an AS/400 is connected to 5250 terminals.andP;  The low-end AS/400system supports two to six concurrent terminal users, while the high-endsystems overlap IBM's more powerful line of System/ 370-architecturemainframes, supporting more than 250 concurrent users.andP;  The AS/400 operatingsystem, Operating System/400, contains an integrated relational database.andM;PC Support, IBM software that resides on both the PC and the AS/400, bridgesthe two architectures and provides many of the connectivity options.andP;  (Seediagram.)andM;One way to link single PCs to an AS/400 is through 5250 terminal emulation.andO;Local attachment is supplied via a PC 5250 adapter card, which is connectedby twin-axial cabling to the AS/400 Twinax Workstation Controller.andP;  RemotePCs can be linked through an AS/400 remote controller or a Synchronous DataLink Control (SDLC) card.andM;A hot key provides the ability to switch back and forth between PC and AS/400tasks.andP;  With PC Support, files can be transferred between the twoarchitectures.andP;  Users may find their PC programs contending with PC Supportfor DOS's 640K bytes, however, since PC Support uses various amounts of RAMdepending on installation specifications.andP;  This connectivity option saves thecost of a 5250 terminal and maximizes work space.andM;The growing number of PCs outside the workplace may increase the demand foranother way to link PCs to the AS/400: the AS/400 ASCII WorkstationController.andP;  This method allows the remote PC to dial in to the AS/400 systemvia a modem.andP;  Each controller has as many as 18 ports, and PC Supportprovides full ASCII terminal emulation.andM;An AS/400 can also be connected to an IBM Token-Ring Network.andP;  A Token-RingNetwork adapter is installed on the AS/400 and cabled into the Multi-stationAccess Unit, just like the remaining network nodes.andM;Whether the AS/400 is linked to a single PC or a Token-Ring LAN, additionalPC Support connectivity options exist, including virtual printing and virtualdisk sharing.andM;Virtual printing allows a PC connected to the AS/400 to print an ASCII fileon any of the AS/400 printers on the network.andP;  Printer access can bemaintained from the PC; programmers do not have to write any AS/400 code.andM;To use an AS/400 printer, a PC user must first create a one-line file.andP;  Tocreate a file named SAMPLE.PCS, for example, the user must type in PRNT3,,PRT22,,,,,,,,,.andP;  The 3 represents LPT3, one of AS/400's three virtualprinters, and PRT22 is an example of the AS/400 printer address.andP;  Positionalparameters between the commas control page layout and translation, but PCSupport defaults can also be used.andM;Next, the PC user enters CFGVPRT SAMPLE.PCS.andP;  A message will appear,acknowledging that LPT3 has been successfully assigned to the appropriateAS/400 printer.andM;The PC user then enters COPY FILENAME LPT3, and the file will beautomatically routed through the AS/400 for printing on PRT22.andM;Virtual-printing commands may be issued from a DOS batch program, and DOSwild-card characters are allowed.andM;PC Support provides only three virtual printers -- LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 -- butthe CFGVPRT command can be continuously issued with different .PCS files toassign AS/400 printers dynamically.andM;PC users connected to an AS/400 can also use AS/400 disk space as if it wereon the PC's fixed disk.andP;  PC Support allows the AS/400 disk space to appear asa DOS drive with directories.andP;  DOS file commands are supported, but only to alimited extent.andM;One note of warning: Any PC Support options requiring modification of theAS/400 should be thoroughly researched to ensure that applicationrequirements will be met.andM;In addition, although connecting to an AS/400 system holds plenty of promisefor PC corporate users, the functionality and prices of the different AS/400models, as well as the adapter and controller cards required for connection,vary greatly.andM;----------Gus W.
