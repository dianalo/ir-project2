The drop at GM may have been due to dealers moving some salesfrom early January to late December to inflate year-end numbers,analysts speculated. Strong truck sales helped bolster saggingautomobile sales industrywide.   The seven U.S. automakers said they sold cars and light trucks ona daily rate of 25,622 vehicles during the Jan. 1-10 period thisyear. During the same period last year, they sold cars and trucks ata daily rate of 24,252.   There were seven selling days in both periods.   GM was the only U.S. maker to show a decline during the period,as its car sales skidded 19.8 percent, to a daily rate of 6,801 inearly January this year compared with a rate of 8,481 during thesame time last year.   ``I think you're just seeing a payback from the end ofDecember,'' said analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. of NewYork. ``A few of the dealers probably called a few of the Jan. 3-4sales Dec. 31 sales (to boost year-end figures).''   David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York agreed,saying: ``Their sales were unbelievably good in late December andunbelievably bad in early January. If you add the two periodstogether and divide by two, things are about normal.   ``There was a lot of year-end window dressing in late December,''Healy added.   During the final 10-day period of December, GM reported a dailysales rate of 14,657 cars a day, more than twice the early Januaryrate.   Overall, U.S. automakers said they sold cars at a daily rate of15,283 during the first 10 days of the year, a 3.1 percent declinefrom a daily rate of 15,765 during the same time last year.   Car sales for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. rose during earlyJanuary, 13 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively.   Light truck sales among all the makers rose 21.8 percent to adaily rate of 10,339 during early January this year compared with arate of 8,488 last year.   Chrysler's light truck sales showed a 46.9 percent increase inearly January, climbing to a daily rate of 2,347 in 1989 from 1,598during the period last year. Chrysler-made cars sold at a rate of2,225 a day in early January this year, up from 1,998 daily rate ofa year before.   Ford said it sold trucks at a daily rate of 3,706 in earlyJanuary, 23.8 percent more than the 2,993 early-January rate lastyear.
