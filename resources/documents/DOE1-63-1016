Iron and aluminumfor compounds form compounds of low solubility product which may seriouslyaffect the heat transfer. Natural organic acids not adequately oxidizedcan accelerate corrosion tremendously. Considering these characteristics,treatment programs have been developed specifically for Brazilian waters.Success of these programs is due to &quot;high performance&quot; dispersants whichwork selectively on certain cations and allow corrosion inhibitors tofunction as efficiently as possible. This paper documents the chemicalcontrol program during a four year period at a crude refinery.</TEXT></DOC>
