In the most pointed airing to date of Israelifrustrations, military and political officials here saidIsrael can't continue to sit passively under the cumulativestrain of almost nightly missile attacks. They added thatIraq's promise to strike Israel with chemical weapons,repeated most recently on Sunday, makes the continuedinability of U.S. jets to erase the Iraqi missile threatparticularly untenable.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We are quite fed up with what's going on here,&quot; said AviPazner, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.&quot;Maybe we can do the job. Our main constraint is militarycoordination.&quot;   Until now, Israeli leaders have expressed confidence inU.S. warplanes to find and destroy the mobile Scud launchersin western Iraq. Israeli officials have vowed countless timesthat Israel would retaliate against Iraq, but at a time andplace that wouldn't interfere with the massive allied airstrikes now in progress.   But the comments in recent days of Mr. Pazner, DefenseMinister Moshe Arens and some Israeli military officersindicate that Israel's patience is spent.   &quot;Why shouldn't the coalition give the green light toIsrael to deal with the missile problem?&quot; asks one Israelimilitary official. &quot;The will to remove the problem is there.The ability, we believe, exists.&quot;   Iraq continues to launch Scuds against Israel, withanother coming last night. An Israeli army spokesman saidthere were no injuries.   In a meeting in the Israeli Parliament Sunday, Mr. Arenstold Israeli legislators that, &quot;Israel can contribute to theremoval of the missile threat on the condition that it isdone with total coordination with the U.S.&quot;   Yesterday, Mr. Arens told a group of U.S. Jewish leadersthat Israel knows within a three-square-mile area where thesurviving Iraqi missile launchers are located and has plansto knock them out.   Military officials noted yesterday that Israel doesn'thave a secret weapon it can deploy against Iraq's hiddenlaunchers. And they cautioned that Jordan, which has promisedto resist any incursions into its territory, could still posea problem if Israeli jets fly through its airspace to reachIraq.   But these officials said Israel's pilots and intelligenceapparatus have been focusing for months on these problems.Israel is confident, they add, that its military can hit manyof the launchers now menacing the country.   &quot;Israel knows the U.S. has planes in the vicinity when themissiles go off,&quot; said one Israeli military official. &quot;Wealso know the U.S. knows where the launchers are. But theyjust don't hit them.&quot;   This official questioned whether U.S. jets, equipped withtheir highly sophisticated bombs, are trying to hit themobile launchers from too high in the air. During the firstfew days of the war, he said, British pilots flying at loweraltitudes seemed to have more success against the launchersthan the Americans, who have limited such attacks in anattempt to minimize casualties.   Some Israeli officials also question why the U.S. hasn'tdeployed its Apache helicopters against the Scuds. OneIsraeli officer suggested that competition between the U.S.Air Force, which is mounting the Scud raids, and the Army,which possesses the Apaches, may explain why the choppershaven't been used.   Commanders of a U.S. armored division that recentlyarrived in Saudi Arabia have said that they have justreceived their first Apaches, and that a cargo ship loadedwith the helicopters had been forced to make an unscheduledstop in Malta.   Israel has withheld reacting to the Iraqi missile attacksso far, heeding American entreaties to stay out of the war.The U.S. fears that an Israeli attack could weaken theresolve of the Arab nations in the U.S.led alliance againstIraq.   In the missile attacks so far on Tel Aviv and Haifa, twoIsraelis have been killed and two have died of heart attacks.More than 200 people have been injured, and nearly 2,000homes and apartments have been damaged.</TEXT></DOC>
