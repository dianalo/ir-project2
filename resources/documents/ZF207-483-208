(system-level integrated circuit simulation)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Feltman, O.B.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Analog and logic simulators are inefficient for avoiding layoutproblems and assuring signal integrity in today's high-speedgallium-arsenide, CMOS, and TTL circuit technologies.andP;  Analogsimulators are too slow to make simulating an entire printedcircuit board practical and require time-consuming translation ofboard entities into capacitance, resistance and inductance models.andO;Logic simulators are only capable of verifying logical behavior.andO;Transmission-line simulation, a relatively new technology, usestools that extract the required data from a circuit board andanalyze it to detect and eliminate signal degradation problems.andO;The advantages of transmission-line simulation include the abilityto correct design problems before prototyping, less restriction onplacement and routing of critical signals, support for differentpackaging technologies, and total system-level analysis.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Transmission LinesSimulation of Computer SystemsCircuit DesignApplication-Specific Integrated CircuitsTestingMethods.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
