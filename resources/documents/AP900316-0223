FALLSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anheuser-Busch Inc. spends millions of dollarstrying to convince people not to drink the brewer's best-sellingbeers, and says it doesn't mind getting only goodwill in return.   ``We are a big part of society's desire to reduce abuse,'' saidSteve Burrows, vice president for consumer awareness and educationat the world's largest brewery, which commands 42 percent of thedomestic beer market. ``It's an area we feel we have aresponsibility to be in.''   The brewer is introducing another national advertising campaignabout responsible drinking Tuesday. This one's called ``Family TalkAbout Drinking'' and it joins 11 other campaigns the company isrunning.   Busch has pioneered an industry effort to promote sobriety anddistance itself from the beer-guzzling image. Moreover, it's justgood business to remind consumers not to over-indulge, saidBurrows, who has worked solely on alcohol awareness programs fornearly a year.   He has a staff of seven and estimates Anheuser-Busch already hasspent $1 million on the new ``Family Talk'' program.   Last year Anheuser-Busch spent as much on the Know When to SayWhen program, which encompasses all its alcohol-awarenessendeavors, as it did on the Michelob Dry rollout, Burrows said.   Although anti-drinking activists have accused some brewers ofusing the sobriety message as a public relations ploy, industryanalysts see no ulterior motives in the push by Busch and otherbrewers to combat alcohol abuse.   George Thompson, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.in New York, said it's a logical path to travel for Busch, whichhas introduced low-alcohol beer (L.A.) and no-alcohol brew(O'Doul's) in the last few years.   Thompson said Busch will never make money on those brands andlikely won't profit from its alcohol awareness programs either.   ``But it's not something they'll let up on,'' Thompson said.``They're not trying to impress people, they're trying to solve theproblem.''   Bob Weinberg, head of of R.S. Weinberg andamp; Associates, St. Louisresearch firm that tracks the brewery business, said a good testwas whether people recalled the brand name sponsoring responsibledrinking ads. He passed.   ``I'm not sure I can distinguish between the brewers,'' saidWeinberg, who is also a professor at Washington University. ``Themessage, I remember.''   The company doesn't expect to strengthen its already dominantposition in the beer industry with ``Family Talk.'' It may evenlose sales.   ``That's business that we will gladly lose,'' Burrows said.   Busch is targeting its ``Family Talk'' campaign at a specificaudience, going for the fathers in Sports Illustrated, the mothersin Good Housekeeping, and both in Newsweek and Parent.   Its message is mostly common sense. The ads invite readers totelephone a toll-free number to obtain guidelines that tell parentshow to be a role model, provide the facts about drinking anddriving, enforce rules and encourage positive friendships.   A six-person staff of expert advisers which helped develop theguides also advises starting discussions on the subject early, atabout age 9. The guides include sample dialogue to encouragebringing up the subject informally.   It may sound simple, but Roger Vogler, a clinical psychologistfrom Pomona Collge in Claremont, Calif., and a member of theadvisory board, says it's not.   ``My experience is that people are surprisingly uninformed aboutthings that may seem pretty obvious,'' Vogler said. ``A lot ofparents in my experience believe that they are there to enforce therules rather than facilitate their kids meeting their own needs.   ``We don't have a good format for teaching people how to parentin our society and I think parents need some help.''   Even before the ad campaign's debut, Burrows spread thetoll-free number by word of mouth through the brewery'swholesalers. He said there already have been hundreds of calls onthe number (1-800-359-TALK) set up for people to order free copiesof the guide packet.   Response has been so brisk, Burrows said, that Anheuser-Buschalso is planning to translate the package into Spanish.   Unlike its other programs, which feature celebrities and sportsfigures warning of the evils of alcohol abuse, ``Family Talk'' ismore subtle. The first ad features a small photo of anold-fashioned bicycle below the message, ``Talk To Your Kid AboutDrinking Before He Gets His First Set Of Wheels.''   It's a different, more low-key approach by a company that spendsmost of its advertising dollar on network sports programming.   As for the ever-burgeoning responsible drinking division atBusch, Burrows says it's not time to say when yet.   ``As we fine-tune this effort, if we see an opportunity, we'llcertainly seize it,'' Burrows said. ``We'll continue to address theissue and we're always looking for new ideas.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday March 19</NOTE></DOC>
