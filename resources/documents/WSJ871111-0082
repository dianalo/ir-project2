StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   A remark by President Reagan that he doesn't want a further decline of the dollar set off a rally by the U.S. currency yesterday that more than wiped out its sizable losses posted earlier in the day.    At about 9 a.m. EST, two hours before news reports of the president's comment hit the market, the dollar was at a record low of 1.6490 West German marks and a 40-year low of 133.22 Japanese yen. The drop was partly a reaction to a New York Times article quoting White House officials as saying the Reagan administration desired a further fall in the dollar.    By midday in New York, the dollar had risen more than 1.6% from its lows as traders bought the U.S. currency to cover short, or oversold, positions.    The rally pushed the dollar to its intraday highs of 1.6775 marks and 135.40 yen.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6668 marks, compared with 1.6595 late Monday, and 134.73 yen, compared with 134.15.    The dollar was quoted at 134.75 yen in early Tokyo trading Wednesday. The Bank of Japan was reported to be buying dollars to support the U.S. currency.    Traders said yesterday's rebound doesn't represent any change in the overall bearish market sentiment on the dollar. Some also said they don't believe Mr. Reagan's remark fully reflects administration policy on the matter. Still, dealers said the dollar was ready for a modest rebound after declining steadily for more than two weeks.    &quot;People were nervous about their short positions to begin with. They ran for cover as soon as they saw an indication for an uptick in the dollar,&quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said.    At yesterday's low, the dollar had fallen 9.3% against the mark since Oct. 22, when speculation began that the U.S. was willing to let the currency decline while it sought to spur the economy through lower interest rates after the stock market crashed. White House officials confirmed that speculation in statements last week.    Yesterday, in response to questions from reporters at the start of a White House meeting with Israeli President Chaim Herzog, Mr. Reagan said of the dollar, &quot;We're not doing anything to bring it down.&quot; He also said, &quot;I don't look for a further decline, don't want a further decline . . . from where it is right now.&quot;    Although traders then bought dollars aggressively, they said they didn't interpret the remarks as a change in administration policy. One bank trader said the president seemed to be expressing his &quot;personal opinion, not U.S. policy.&quot; The trader said the financial markets &quot;depend more heavily on (Treasury Secretary) Baker&quot; for guidance on administration policy.    Alfred Driever, vice president, foreign exchange, at Salomon Brothers Inc., New York, said he viewed the statement as &quot;nothing more than an effort to calm down the market.&quot;    Before Mr. Reagan spoke yesterday, the White House issued a statement disavowing the New York Times report about administration officials welcoming a lower dollar. The statement said the U.S. &quot;continues to cooperate closely with its G-7 allies to promote exchange-rate stability.&quot;    The G-7, or Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- agreed in February to pursue stable exchange rates and are believed to have set limits or trading ranges for major currencies.    Concern about holding oversold dollar positions over today's Veterans Day holiday in the U.S. and tomorrow's report on the September U.S. trade deficit also was partly responsible for the sharp reaction to the Reagan statement.    With many banks in the U.S. closed for the holiday, trading is expected to be light today, which also means it could be volatile. Tomorrow's report on the closely watched merchandise trade balance also could produce a large swing in the dollar's value.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 90 cents an ounce to $461 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 4.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $461.65 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Tuesday, Nov. 10, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
