In one recent sweep, police arrested 65 youths aged 11 to 14 for allegedly stealing an estimated $250,000 in merchandise.    In Hammond, La., a young woman and her boyfriend were abducted from an unguarded shopping-center parking lot. In a local wooded area, they were robbed and shot. The boyfriend died; the woman lives on, as a paraplegic.    In the Northland Mall outside Detroit, police tallied 2,083 crimes in 1985. Of these, 1,041 crimes were serious, including murders, assaults, rapes, robberies and car thefts. It could have been worse, police say, had it not been for the mall management's tough approach: Northland's guards receive 240 hours of police training and have full arrest power, which eliminates any waiting for local police to arrive.    Shopping malls are convenient -- for criminals as well as for consumers. Glistening merchandise, soothing music and climate-controlled, leafy walkways lure shoppers -- and relax their guard. The preoccupied crowds, in turn, lure shoplifters, car thieves, muggers and rapists. Though not as crime-ridden as inner cities, suburban malls aren't as safe as they look.    &quot;Middle-class America has enjoyed the notion that crime is something that happened to those over there, on the other side of town,&quot; says Charles Friel, the dean of the college of criminal justice at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. &quot;It's unnerving, but we're learning more and more that crime occurs in the nice places, like suburban malls.&quot;    Crime victims learn that the hard way. &quot;I never thought about crime there before. I assumed it was safe,&quot; says a victim of a sexual assault at an upscale mall. &quot;At night, you naturally feel it's safer than the streets because you're inside an enclosed area. But a lot of times, that just isn't the case. Now, I never go alone to a mall at night. It doesn't matter how safe it looks.&quot; Another woman says that whenever she goes to the mall alone -- day or night -- she brings her German shepherd to protect her when she returns to her car.    Despite efforts to beef up security, even some store employees have grown leery. At Rockaway Townsquare Mall, an enclosed regional center in Rockaway Township, N.J., with two fountains sparkling beneath a giant skylight and tree-lined concourses linking stores such as Sears and Macy's, a clerk at a health-food store comments, &quot;I wouldn't come here alone after 5 p.m. The place really changes.&quot;    But one Townsquare shopper doing what police say you shouldn't do -- putting her shopping bags on her car roof, hunting through her purse for her keys, opening the door and placing the open purse on the driver's seat, then going around to the trunk with her bags -- comments, &quot;I don't have the time to worry about crime.&quot;    No one tallies national statistics on mall crime or on mall-security litigation, and many such cases are settled out of court. Although malls' security offices usually keep track of complaints, mall owners aren't eager to publicize crime problems. And most police statistics are organized according to geographical grids that may or may not isolate crime rates at a given mall.    Moreover, &quot;there is no such thing as a typical mall,&quot; says Anthony Potter, an Atlanta security consultant. &quot;Each has an individual set of problems.&quot; Besides, he adds, &quot;A mall changes through the years, as demographics change, as crime in the area and society changes.&quot;    As crime spreads to the suburbs, malls, especially older ones in formerly white-collar suburbs, are increasingly vulnerable.    &quot;Where else will you find so many unattended women with money and with their minds in other places?&quot; asks David Green, a Hamilton, Ohio, attorney who has represented several victims of crimes in southern Ohio malls. &quot;Crime moves out where the people are.&quot;    According to a survey for the International Council of Shopping Centers, about 70% of adults regularly visit regional malls. And with video-game arcades, fast-food restaurants, movie theaters and parking-lot cruising scenes, malls also have become teen-age hangouts.    &quot;Malls are the new Main Streets of America, but they get more crime per capita than the old Main Streets used to,&quot; says Lawrence Sherman, a University of Maryland criminologist. Unlike Main Streets, where homes were scattered among shops and store owners were more likely to raise a hue and cry, &quot;malls are a no man's land,&quot; he says.    They certainly aren't safe havens, police records in some communities show -- though police say &quot;retail crimes,&quot; such as credit-card fraud and shoplifting, far outnumber crimes against persons. In malls, criminal rings see a low-risk, high-profit opportunity, says Police Chief Joseph Delaney in Paramus, N.J. They can make off with $25,000 of merchandise in a single afternoon of one-stop shoplifting -- risking perhaps a six-month sentence if caught. In a burglary or car theft, they might reap only $5,000 while risking perhaps a three-to-five-year sentence, Chief Delaney says.    In Paramus, 90% of crime occurs in malls. A police study shows 1,670 reported crimes at the malls -- including 79 assaults and 346 stolen cars as well as robberies and shoplifting -- in the first seven months of 1987. Chief Delaney expects Paramus's mall crime to increase 40% this year -- on top of a 20% rise last year -- partly because of an escalating drug problem.    In south Florida, one upscale mall was beset, from 1982 through 1984, with 10 sex offenses, 176 assaults, 64 holdups, 579 burglaries, 445 stolen cars and about 2,000 larcenies, including shoplifting.    In Minneapolis, more police calls come from a store in the Minnehaha Mall than anywhere else. Police Sgt. Bud Emerson says the mall &quot;is in a middle-class area, looks beautiful and is so clean you could eat off the floor.&quot; But with valuables and victims so concentrated, he says, &quot;you draw the people who need a victim.&quot;    Aside from crowds, a mall's greatest draw for criminals is its parking lot. A vast car-filled lot offers camouflage to criminals waiting for victims. &quot;The brigands are operating in fields beyond the moats and walls of the sheltered city,&quot; says Mr. Friel in Texas. Moreover, mall lots, close to highways, are tailor-made for smooth escapes; in cities, by contrast, thieves may have to double-park their getaway cars, then flee into a traffic jam.    &quot;We've had some incredible atrocities, like sexual crimes, in mall parking lots,&quot; says Joseph McNamara, the police chief of San Jose, Calif. He describes a recurring abduction scenario: A woman returns to her car but can't start it. A man appears, offering help. He opens the hood and, pretending to tinker with the engine, replaces the distributor cap that he removed while she was shopping. He then offers to test the car, takes the wheel, produces a weapon and drives off with his victim.    Some abductions are more straightforward. In 1981 at The Mall at 163rd Street in North Miami Beach -- a 150-store mall with a translucent, tentlike white roofing, attractive tree-lined walkways and a three-story atrium -- a woman was abducted from a parking garage at 11:15 on a weekday morning. As she was entering her car, a man with a gun accosted her. He drove her to a remote spot and robbed and raped her.    Last month, a 25-year-old woman, shopping on her lunch break, vanished from the middle-range Morris County Mall in Hanover, N.J. A few days later, her 1986 Firebird turned up in Palm Beach, Fla., but she is still missing. At the same mall in 1982, an 18-year-old woman was abducted and later found stabbed to death.    Inside malls, restrooms are the chief sites of sexual assaults and drug deals. Mr. Potter, the Atlanta consultant, says that until recently, many restrooms were in low-traffic, hard-to-lease areas. Now, he says, security-minded developers are putting them in more visible places.    The women's restroom at the glossy Paddock Mall in the horse-farm area of Ocala, Fla., is at the end of a meandering corridor secluded from the busy concourses. Late one afternoon in April 1984, a 26-year-old woman entered. An armed man lurking in a restroom stall robbed, sexually assaulted and attempted to rape her, according to depositions by the victim and others.    Theodore Franklin Adams, now serving a 20-year sentence for the assault, said in a deposition that he chose the Paddock Mall over the community college across the highway because the college had &quot;too many people and too many security guards.&quot; According to another deposition, the sole guard on duty was at the other end of the mall. The victim is suing the mall, alleging inadequate security.    A guard at the DeSoto Square Mall in Bradenton, Fla., allegedly learned of a 1983 parking-lot abduction only by happenstance. According to his deposition, he was listening to his police-band radio more than two hours after the abduction and heard the reports of officers who had been called to a nearby woods where the woman had been robbed and raped.    As more crime victims sue over lax security, many -- but not all -- mall owners are trying to fortify their sprawling premises. They are beefing up security forces, installing electronic surveillance, strengthening ties with police and ballyhooing crime prevention. Some malls in California, Georgia, Indiana and Minnesota have police stations on the premises.    Melvin Simon Co. of Indianapolis, which owns 60 malls, has a 24-hour police substation with 20 officers at its Southtown Mall in Fort Wayne, Ind. At Simon malls, some maintenance workers carry walkie-talkies to communicate with security guards. And Detroit-based Taubman Co. began a security-awareness program in 1985 for all tenants of its 19 malls nationwide.    Retailers at malls often hire their own guards in addition to paying, as tenants, for guards and other services in the common areas. Mall-industry publications brim with advice on security measures to limit liability. And security consultants report brisk business. Mr. Potter has been asked to serve as an expert witness in about 300 court cases over the past 15 years -- half of them in the past four years.    A fairly typical comment about mall security comes from Charles Leibler, the president of Equity Properties andamp; Development Co., which acquired the North Miami Beach mall only about six months before the 1981 abduction and rape. Compared with a decade ago, he says, &quot;we are spending lots of extra dollars today in such areas as security and lighting&quot; at the company's properties. Noting that The Mall at 163rd Street is adjacent to a high school, he comments, &quot;Other than the ordinary teenage exuberance, we have no problems.&quot;    Despite the crime statistics and the lawsuits, some mall owners stoutly deny there is any problem. They resist increasing security costs lest they discourage attractive tenants. And some fear that high-profile security will deter shoppers.    &quot;It's like a school with a drug problem,&quot; Chief Delaney says. &quot;They want to maintain the aura of safety.&quot;    At some malls, turnover is high among guards, who often are minimum-wage workers with scant training or pre-employment screening. Yet they police the equivalent of small towns and should be thoroughly familiar with mall clientele, tenants and physical layout, says Robert C. Villines, an Atlanta security consultant.    Though crime is rising in the Paramus area, the security force was pruned at the Bergen Mall after Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. acquired the 50-store, somewhat scruffy center earlier this year and asked its 19 security guards to accept a pay cut to $5.50 an hour from $9. The guards refused and were fired, according to the International Union of Police and Protection Employees. It adds that replacements -- less than half the original number -- were hired at the lower wage. Police were never told about the cutback, says Chief Delaney, who adds that he is perplexed partly because his statistics show crime at the mall up 23% from 1984 to 1986.    However, Stanley Sams, DeBartolo's director of security, says there is &quot;no foundation&quot; to the story of why the guards were fired and to reports of a cutback in security. He says that the guards were fired for incompetence and that the company, using contract as well as in-house guards, adjusts the levels of security to crime statistics and seasonal needs. &quot;There's more coverage now&quot; than before, he contends. And one retail manager does note some recent improvements, including a central information booth.    In some areas, civilians have acted on their own. The Guardian Angels, a vigilante group formed to fight crime on New York subways, patrolled mall parking lots in Tampa, Fla., late last year after a wave of abductions there. The Guardian Angels have been called by citizens to patrol malls in California and Texas as well as Florida, Curtis Sliwa, the president, says.    The extent of mall owners' liability for customers' safety is a thorny issue. Courts increasingly are siding with plaintiffs who can prove that mall managements ignored local crime rates in planning for security. &quot;The litigation of the mid-1980s is saying we have the duty to protect the customer,&quot; says James P. Brown, the security director at San Diego's Horton Plaza mall.    In June, for example, an Amite, La., court awarded $2.5 million to Tammy Willy, the survivor in the 1984 Hammond, La., shooting. The court ruled that Federal Realty Investment Trust, which then owned the mall but later sold it, and ISM Associates Inc., the mall manager, hadn't provided adequate security at the Town andamp; Country Plaza shopping center. One of Federal's insurers is appealing the decision.    In addition to tightened security, some experts see other ways to curb mall crime. &quot;Sometimes the best deterrent is an attentive clerk,&quot; says John May, Taubman's corporate director of operations. Others say another strong deterrent is the cautious, well-informed shopper.    &quot;Just spend an hour watching mall behavior, and you'll know why criminals can get what they want,&quot; says Ronald Haigh, a detective with the Rockaway Township, N.J., police force. He asks: &quot;Why can't mall shoppers use the same precaution they would, say, on 42nd Street {in New York} at 1 a.m.?&quot; Mr. Haigh suggests that malls join with police to conduct crime-prevention workshops for shoppers.    That might be too much for some mall owners. Many are still loath to acknowledge -- much less publicize -- the dark side of their sparkling utopias. Says Kathleen Philips, a Miami, Fla., attorney: &quot;It goes against what they're trying to do -- sell products in a seemingly safe paradise. They won't put a skull and crossbones there to deter business.&quot;    ---                 Crimes That Can Plague a Mall   Examples from police records covering the past three and ahalf years of crimes at The Mall at 163rd Street in NorthMiami Beach, Fla.   1.
