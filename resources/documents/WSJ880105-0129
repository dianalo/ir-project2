It was the international agency's 11th successive semiannual reduction in the rate since mid-1982, when the bank adopted a variable lending rate for its credits to Third World nations to support economic-development projects and structural economic adjustments.    The World Bank's variable lending rate is keyed to the bank's own borrowing costs in world capital markets, which declined slightly during the second half of 1987.    World Bank officials said the new 7.72% rate will remain in effect during the first half of 1988. In mid-1982, the rate was set at 11.43%. </TEXT></DOC>
