GIVEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texaco Inc. chieftains and Carl C. Icahn, thecompany's largest shareholder, come to their showdown Friday as thelast ballots are cast in a proxy fight that could lead to thebiggest corporate buyout in American history.   But the winner won't be known for weeks. It is expected to takethat long to sort out the proxy ballots.   Icahn, holder of 14.8 percent of Texaco's 243 million shares, isrunning with four allies for the five seats up for election to thecompany's 14-member board.   He is seeking the seats to pressure the company to letstockholders vote on his offer to buy the Texaco shares he does notalready own for $60 each, or about $12.4 billion. Adding the $1.2billion he already paid for his stake would raise the acquisitioncost to $13.6 billion, the biggest sum ever paid in a corporatebuyout.   Two weeks ago Icahn said if he lost, he would sell his stake and``go away,'' but in recent days he said he might try a hostiletakeover bid.   Voting has been going on since late May and ends officially atTexaco's annual meeting Friday in Tulsa, Okla.   In the last hours, it was widely believed there was no clearfront-runner. Several major institutions were reported to have casttheir votes for Icahn, while others were said to be leaning towardTexaco. Traditionally, individuals tend to vote for management, butvarious sources said it was impossible to assume anything this time.   On Wall Street, Texaco shares have traded near $50 a share,reflecting the market's skepticism that Icahn will be able to pullof the deal.   The annual meeting will bring to a head the latest phase of amonths-long war of nerves, invective, lawsuits, charges andcounter-charges between the nation's third largest oil company andthe wily takeover artist.   Texaco said that Ichan tried to force Texaco to buy out hisstake for an above-market price, a practice known as greenmail, andthat he tried to manipulate its stock. Icahn called the allegationa ``fairy tale,'' and said Texaco offered to pay him greenmail buthe refused.   Icahn, in turn, argued that Texaco's management``misappropriated'' corporate assets in California. Texaco calledthe charge a ``complete fabrication.''   Both sides have lawsuits pending against the other.   Icahn begain buying up Texaco shares last fall, while thecompany was struggling to overcome a $10.3 billion judgment heldagainst it by Pennzoil Co.   Pennzoil won the judgment when a jury ruled Texaco hadimproperly interfered with Pennzoil's deal to acquire part of GettyOil Co., then bought Getty itself. The ruling ultimately led toTexaco's filing for bankruptcy court reorganization in April 1987.   A December agreement by Texaco to settle with Pennzoil for $3billion was the keystone of the reorganization plan ultimatelyapproved by the court in April. But not without stiff oppositionfrom Icahn.   He battled against Texaco's management to strip antitakeoverprovisions from its charter.   Amid increasing acrimony, he accused Texaco management of``getting itself into this multibillion-dollar mess,'' then seekingto entrench itself at the shareholders' expense.   In turn, Texaco President James W. Kinnear and other topexecutives accused Icahn of seeking to bolster his own profits atthe expense of Texaco's other stockholders.   Icahn lost some of those battles, but won some others, at timeswith support from shareholders equally unhappy with the company'sperformance _ and particularly with the bankruptcy filing, whichresulted in the suspension of its dividend for one year.   As a result, Texaco agreed to include a vote on certain``corporate governance'' on the proxy ballot, including, amongothers, restrictions on the adoption of takeover defenses, ananti-greenmail provision and more participation by shareholders inchoosing directors.   It also talked up its restructuring plan, a major feature ofwhich was sales of $3 billion worth of underperforming assets.   But that was not enough for Icahn.   In February he announced his intention to run his five-man slatefor the board. At the time, Texaco's stock was selling near $38 ashare.   Icahn offered to withdraw his slate, if management took moresteps to raise Texaco's stock price. With an eye to restlessstockholders, management restored the $3 annual dividend and addedan additional $2 billion in proposed asset sales.   It also struck back in early May, accusing Icahn of violatingfederal securities laws and asking a federal judge to bar him fromusing his stock against the company.   Weeks of peace talks ensued, as Icahn sought to find a way todispose of his stake without depressing Texaco's price at the sametime.   After Texaco broke off the talks on May 25, he announced hisbuyout offer, which put a $14.6 billion value on the company.   But Texaco refused to let shareholders vote on the proposal,prompting Icahn to launch his proxy fight.</TEXT></DOC>
