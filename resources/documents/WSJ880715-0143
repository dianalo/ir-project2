Klein </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> Los Angeles  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The world's best female athlete, ever, sat in a booth at a Denny's restaurant just off the San Diego Freeway here last week, poking at a luncheon salad and musing about getting better.    &quot;Oh, I'm improving. No doubt about that. It's only a question of how much,&quot; says Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the world champion and record holder in the seven-event heptathlon, track and field's sternest test of female skill and endurance.    &quot;And when,&quot; chimes in Bob Kersee, her husband and coach.    &quot;When is next week in Indianapolis,&quot; says Joyner-Kersee.    &quot;Maybe when should be September in Seoul,&quot; says Kersee.    &quot;Maybe both,&quot; says Joyner-Kersee, to which her husband can only shrug in reply.    &quot;As long as we've been together, I suppose I should stop being surprised at what she can do, but she can still amaze me,&quot; says Kersee, whose usual style is not hyperbolic. &quot;Her performances are like a great opera or concert. I feel like I should be wearing a tux when I watch them.&quot;    &quot;That,&quot; laughs Mrs. J-K, &quot;would be about the first time since our wedding that you've worn anything but warmups.&quot;    Joyner-Kersee will take the track this morning at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Indianapolis in search of a berth in the Summer Games at Seoul, and, given the recent steamy weather in the nation's heartland, formal dress is not advised. Still, her triumph in the heptathlon is regarded as about as close to a formality as anything can be in sports. The same goes for the long jump, in which she shared the world's record of 24 feet, 5 1/2 inches until it was broken a month ago.    Joyner-Kersee won both events at the World Championships in Rome in September, accounting for two of the six individual gold medals captured by U.S. athletes there (three more firsts came in relay races). Those figures bespeak both a relative American decline in the Olympics' center-ring activity, and a unique opportunity for her. If she repeats her Rome performances in Seoul, look for her sleek, 5-foot-10 frame to grace Wheaties boxes.    That such lucrative commercial baubles haven't already come her way has been a topic of comment by those who believe that female athletes, and black female athletes in particular, have not reaped their just deserts in U.S. sport biz. It's a point that the Kersees are content to ignore for the present.    &quot;If the money comes, it'll come, but focusing on it now would be like thinking about the dessert before you've had the main course,&quot; says Kersee, no pun intended.    In fact, the 26-year-old Joyner-Kersee has been focusing on the main course -- an Olympic championship -- since she was a girl of 14 in rundown East St. Louis, Ill. She'd been something of a track prodigy, and had captured a national junior championship in the five-event pentathlon. But she says that the notion of pursuing the sport seriously sank in only while she watched the 1976 Olympics on television. &quot;Seeing it on TV made it real for me in a way that just competing hadn't,&quot; she recalls.    As one token of her new dedication, young Jackie gave up her part-time job selling popcorn in a movie theater. She also gave up cheerleading, a greater wrench. (&quot;It gave me a chance to be around lots of boys,&quot; she giggles). That left basketball and volleyball as well as track, but a girl has to do something to pass the time.    Joyner-Kersee was so skilled in the hoop sport that it won her a scholarship offer from sunny UCLA, which, being no dummy, she accepted with alacrity. Service on the track squad there brought her into contact with the lean, intense Kersee, an assistant women's-team coach (he's the women's head coach now), and it was he who persuaded her to concentrate on the heptathlon instead of the long jump, her high-school specialty.    &quot;The talent was there, and it would have been a shame to waste it,&quot; the 34-year-old Kersee explains.    &quot;No,&quot; says Joyner-Kersee. &quot;I went along because the heptathlon was less boring than just jumping,&quot; she says, grinning. &quot;I used to hate waiting around for the meet to end after my one little event was over.&quot;    Joyner-Kersee won the NCAA heptathlon in 1982 and '83, and was favored to win the lightly contested go in the '84 Olympics at Los Angeles. Several weeks before the competition, however, she pulled a hamstring, and while the injury wasn't disabling, it nagged. Still, she went into the 800-meter run, the event's final (and her weakest) segment, needing only to finish within 2.39 seconds of Glynis Nunn of Australia to win. She came up 0.33 second, and five points, short.    But the setback quickly became her point of departure. Training full-time under Kersee, whom she was to marry in 1986, she improved her techniques in such unfamiliar facets of her event as the high jump, javelin throw and shot put, while learning to control the exercise-induced asthma that had hindered her training in college.    At the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, she overcame a queasy stomach and seemingly capricious schedule changes to become the first women ever to top the 7,000-point mark by scoring 7,148 points in the heptathlon -- more than 700 above her Olympic total. A month later, in Houston, she added 10 points to that count. No other woman has come within 200 points of her score.    That J-K will better her mark -- at Indianapolis, Seoul or both -- is almost a foregone conclusion. Last year at the Pan Am Games in the Hoosier metropolis, she highlighted an otherwise blah track meet by tying the long-jump world mark with a leap more than a foot better than her heptathlon best. In May, she tied the U.S. record by running the 100-meter high hurdles, also a heptathlon event, in 12.61 seconds. Last month, at a meet in Irvine, Calif., she heaved the shot 55 feet, more than five feet farther than she had while setting the multi-event record.    &quot;Other people can get it all together once or twice, but Jackie can do it over and over, like someone playing a piano,&quot; marvels her brother, Al, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump. &quot;And every time she does it, it sounds sweet.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
