(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Lawrence Livermore nuclear weaponslaboratory was shut down today after an electrical transformer blewup in a fireball seen a mile away, touching off a series ofexplosions and fires.   The blasts and fires Thursday night at the laboratory, wherenuclear weapons are designed, followed a power outage that plungedthe 500-building complex into darkness, said laboratory spokeswomanSue Stephenson.   There were no injuries reported and the three fires were put outin about an hour, she said.   Most of the damage took place at the lab's main switchingsubstation, a long metal structure.   ``The windows were turned brown by the flames and firefighterschopped holes in the roof,'' said Stephenson, who estimated damageto the building at $250,000.   The fires began when the main transformer in the switchingbuilding exploded, sending an electrical surge into transformers atthe two other buildings, said Jay Davis, the lab's emergency dutyofficer.   The other explosions and fires were at power transmission boxesoutside two other buildings. Those fires also burned some nearbybushes.   Davis said that when the main transformer blew up, it sent up afireball that was visible from his home, about a mile away.   The fires were all several blocks from the high-securitybuilding where plutonium is stored and did not affect any sectionof the lab where nuclear materials are kept, Stephenson said.   ``They are safe and secure,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
