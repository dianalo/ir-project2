Background </ITAG>The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201<T3>et seq. </T3>(SMCRA) sets forth the general statutory requirementsgoverning surface coal mining operations and the surface impacts of undergroundcoal mining. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE)has implemented by regulations, the general requirements of SMCRA, andthe requirements specific to the States with approved regulatory programs.In the case of Tennessee, there is no approved State regulatory program.OSMRE directly regulates the surface coal mining operations in Tennesseethrough regulations contained in 30 CFR Part 942. This part was promulgatedon October 1, 1984 (49 FR 38892), and revised on May 29, 1986 (51 FR 19462).OSMRE, through the Division of Tennessee Permitting (DTP), has been developingcriteria for use in Tennessee in determining whether a proposed revisionto an existing coal mining permit is significant and therefore subjectto the public notice and hearing requirements of 30 CFR Part 774 as incorporatedby 30 CFR 942.774(a). In direct response to draft guidelines developedby DTP, Ms. Carol S. Nickle and Mr. Mark Squillace, representing four organizations(Environmental Policy Institute, Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation,Illinois South Project and Save Our Cumberland Mountains), filed a petitionfor rulemaking on February 19, 1986. Pursuant to section 201(g) of SMCRA,any person may petition the Director, OSMRE, ``to initiate a proceedingfor the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.'' The principal concernsof the petitioners are that the DTP failed to incorporate all of the petitioners'comments on earlier draft guidelines and that the guidelines are rulesand can only be implemented by following the requirements of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 <T3>et seq.</T3>). OSMRE published a notice on March 5, 1987, granting the petition for theFederal program for Tennessee and accepting the petitioners' proposed criteriain principle (52 FR 6827). In the decision on the petition it was notedthat section 511 of SMCRA requires the regulatory authority to establishguidelines for determining when a proposed revision to a permit is significant.As the regulatory authority in Tennessee, OSMRE is developing guidelinesfor use in that State. OSMRE would not develop such guidelines for Stateswith approved regulatory programs, because under 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) theregulatory authorities in primacy States develop such guidelines to reflecttheir own unique circumstances and interests. In granting the petition,for the Federal program in Tennessee, OSMRE decided to provide criteriafor review of permit revision applications in that State by rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Proposed Rule </ITAG>Under the provisions of 30 CFR 774.13, OSMRE, as the regulatory authorityfor surface coal mining and reclamation activities in Tennessee, is proposingcriteria to determine when a proposed permit revision is significant. Thesecriteria for significant revisions to permits, and the public notice andhearing requirements to which they are subject will both be detailed inproposed amendments to 30 CFR 942.774. Under the proposed amendments, OSMRE would review each administrativelycomplete application for a permit revision to determine if any of the proposedrevisions included in the application match the criteria proposed hereinas significant revisions. Should any one of the proposed revisions be foundto be significant, the permit application information requirements andprocedures of Subchapter G, including public notice, public participationand notice of decision requirements of andSection;andSection; 773.13, 773.19(b)(1) and (3), and 778.21, would be followed for the evaluation of the proposedrevisions in that application. OSMRE has gained considerable experience with significant revisions inthe review of revision applications received during the conduct of theFederal Program for Tennessee. This experience together with the commentletters received pursuant to the June 13, 1986 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice soliciting comments on this petition,and the concerns rulemaking expressed in the petition itself, aided inidentifying those revisions that would constitute significant revisions.Section 942.774 Proposed andSection; 942.774 would codify criteria for determinations ofsignificant revisions at 30 CFR 942.774 paragraph (c). Existing paragraph(c) would be redesignated as paragraph (d). Existing paragraph (b) containsmaterial on both revisions in general and significant revisions. The materialon significant revisions would be removed from paragraph (b) and addedto proposed new paragraph (c) which would consolidate requirements forsignificant revisions. The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(b) would contain general requirementsfor permit revisions. It would provide that any revision to the approvedmining or reclamation plan would be subject to review and approval by theOffice.The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c) would state that a significant revisionto the mining or reclamation plan would be subject to the permit applicationinformation requirements and procedures of Subchapter G, including notice,public participation, and notice of decision requirements of andSection;andSection;773.13, 773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21, prior to approval and implementation.Any proposed revision would be considered significant if it meets any ofthe specific requirements contained in andSection;andSection; 942.774(c)(1)through (c)(8).The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c)(1) would provide that revisionsresulting in adverse impacts beyond those previously considered, that wouldaffect cultural resources listed on or eligible to be listed on the NationalRegister of Historic Places, would constitute a significant revision.The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c)(2) would provide that any changesto an approved blasting plan which would be likely to cause adverse impactbeyond those previously considered, to persons or property outside of thepermit area, would constitute a significant revision. A proposal for achange in the blasting plan that expedites the reasonable course of miningand which is proposed only for that purpose, may in and of itself be considereda non-significant revision if there is no potential for injury to personsor damage to property outside the permit area.The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c)(3) would provide that a proposedrevision that would result in adverse impacts beyond those previously considered,affecting a legitimate water supply to which the requirements of 30 CFR816.41(h) apply, would constitute a significant revision. A proposed revisionthat is not reasonably expected to impact a legitimate or reasonable wateruse may be considered non-significant.The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c)(4) would provide that a proposedrevision which would require a new or updated probable hydrologic consequencesdetermination or cumulative hydrologic impact analysis as required under30 CFR 780.21(f)(4) or 780.21(g)(2) would be considered a significant revision.The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c)(5) would provide that a proposedrevision that requires a change in procedures for identification, disturbance,or handling of toxic- or acid-forming materials different from those previouslyconsidered, where the changes have the potential for causing additionalimpacts not previously considered (such as long-term environmental, publichealth or safety effects beyond the permit boundary), would be consideredsignificant revisions. A proposed revision to incorporate an equivalentor better, demonstrated and proven methodology for the identification,disturbance, or handling of toxic- or acid-forming materials from thosepreviously considered may be considered non-significant.The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c)(6) would provide that a proposedrevision which would result in adverse impacts on fish, wildlife and relatedenvironmental values beyond those previously considered, would be considereda significant revision.The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c)(7) would provide that a proposedrevision which provides for the addition of a coal processing facilityor any permanent support facility, where the addition of the facility wouldcause impacts not previously considered, would be considered as a significantrevision, except for a coal processing facility used exclusively for crushingand screening. The addition of coal processing facilities, such as a washplant, which have the potential effect of concentrating toxic materialsfrom the coal in the form of coarse refuse which must be disposed of byproper means would be considered a significant revision. The addition ofa temporary crusher, screener, or similar non-permanent facility whichdoes not concentrate coal wastes and that expedites the reasonable courseof mining may be considered a non-significant revision.The proposed rule at 30 CFR 942.774(c)(8) would provide that a revisionwould be considered significant if it involves a change in the postminingland use to a residential, industrial/commercial, recreation or developedwater resources land use, as defined in 30 CFR 701.5; except that a changeto a developed water resource not meeting the size criteria of the MineSafety and Health Administration (MSHA) standards at 30 CFR 77.216(a) neednot be considered a significant revision.Consideration of a proposed revision to an existing permit is not to beconfused with incidental boundary revisions. Under 30 CFR 774.13(d) theonly extensions allowed in the size of a permit area without requiringa new permit are incidental boundary revisions. Any other extensions tothe area covered by a permit are not considered revisions, and must bemade by application for a new permit.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.

The rule does not distinguish between small andlarge entities. The economic effects of the proposed rule are estimatedto be minor and no incremental economic effects are anticipated as a resultof the rule.National Environmental Policy ActSection 702(d) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act providesthat promulgation of a Federal program shall not constitute a major Federalaction under the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332.
