So why are the present problems atIBM not the fault of current management? The reason is that when IBM wasflying high in the 1970s and early 1980s, it already exhibited most of thedeep-seated faults that have now turned round to bite it.andP;  Users bought IBMequipment not because they loved IBM, loved the equipment, but because thecompany had achieved such critical mass that it seemed to be the onlycomputer company that could be guaranteed still to be around in 10 years'time.andP;  Users had seen RCA Corp quit the industry and Sperry and ICL Plcsubsequently phase out the RCA product line, had seen General Electric Cothrow in the towel, Xerox Corp drop out in 1975.andP;  If companies as big asthose couldn't be relied upon to stay the course, then the only safe bet wasa company as big and strong but one that also lived and died by computers.andO;And so, at the first convenient interval, the majority of Sperry, Honeywell,Burroughs users made for the exit and converted to IBM.andP;  There was a price topay - most of its competitors built smarter machines and had better software,but they were no longer safe.andP;  In 1975, Amdahl Corp arrived on the scene andquickly received a warm welcome from IBM users because over the next fewyears, IBM's price-performance curve improved at a much faster rate than ithad in the early years of the 1970s - but there was a downside.andP;  Users soonfound that enhancements were being made to new models of IBM's mainframes notbecause they offered any real benefit to the user but simply because theywould be difficult and time-consuming for Amdahl to imitate.andP;  Yet IBM hadthis strange delusion that users bought IBM because they loved the companyand really believed its products were the best available.andM;MediocrityandM;This was demonstrably not true: in the mid-1980s, IBM finally got around torunning six processors under a single copy of the operating system.andP;  Gosh!andO;Sperry, Honeywell and Burroughs had all been able to do that a decadeearlier.andP;  The fact has always been that IBM is dedicated to the excellentimplementation of mediocrity, so much so that when the company came up withthe good idea of creating a company within a company in the shape of theGeneral Systems Division, it had to be shut down and folded back into themorass when it overstepped the mark by coming out with a truly excellentmachine in the shape of the object-oriented System 38: the 38 was far toogood - it threatened the hegemony of the Data Processing Division andobsolete 370 architecture.andP;  And for the next six years, the machine wasstarved of resources, IBMers were forbidden to discuss the potential benefitsof object-oriented programming - indeed many of them took refuge in decliningto admit even that the thing was object-oriented.andP;  And then IBM made itsfatal mistake.andP;  It introduced the Personal Computer - in the mostcontemptuous way possible: the machine used the crippled version of the 8086chip, it had tiny capacity floppy drives, IBM was too mean to put in a fivecent reboot button or an acceptable-sized keyboard buffer.andP;  But the thing wasa step forward from the 8-bit CP/M machines that dominated the desktop and itgave third party software developers an accepted single target machine towrite for.andP;  And it was a phenomenal success.andP;  A year later IBM upgraded itwith a faster CPU, going to the full 8086 and put 600Kb floppy disk drives onit.andP;  And in 1983, it came out with a killer model, an 80286 machine with a40Mb hard disk.andP;  Well that was the plan anyway.andP;  But the original machinewith its crippled microprocessor was selling so well and was so cheap tobuild that IBM scrapped all the upgrade machines and simply stuck a 10Mb harddisk into the original, and grudgingly went to a 360Kb floppy.andP;  BetweenSeptember 1981 and September 1984, that's all it did.andP;  But as it had built itentirely from off-the-shelf parts, and it didn't move, it was a sittingtarget - and along came the clonemakers to eat IBM's lunch, as it so richlydeserved for the contemptuous way it had treated the customer.andP;  In a panic,it scrapped the planned 80286 machine and rushed out a version with changesto the architecture designed to trip up the clonemakers.andP;  Instead, it trippeditself up, was hopelessly backlogged for nine months and gave everycompetitor all the time necessary to come up with an acceptable clone.andM;Relative failureandM;The AT was a relative failure in IBM's terms, and that was the end of thecompany's golden age.andP;  The MS-DOS revolution had liberated the user from thetyranny of the proprietary operating system, and Unix, which ran oneverything from micros to supercomputers, was waiting in the wings to respondto the call for the same kind of vendor-independent architecture offered bythe Personal Computer.andP;  But IBM's entire top management has not only beeneducated to manage success, but is deeply imbued with the belief that IBM'sgolden age was the just reward for the unrivalled excellence of its products,instead of being born out of brutal market forces and user necessity.andP;  Andthe only response top and middle management can come up with is to applyband-aids - the ludicrously overblown Systems Application Architecture,pegged to an operating system, OS/2, introduced not because it was needed byusers but because it would trip up the clone market.andP;  SAA would have been agood idea in 1975: by the time it was introduced it was an irrelevance.andP;  Thesimilarities between Armonk and the Kremlin have been irresistible for years- the same obsessive secrecy, the same suspicion of outsiders, the samebelief in a creed that was founded on a myth.andP;  And the more John Akers triesto turn IBM around, the worse things seem to get - this year's devastatinglypoor figures have come after tens of thousands of IBMers have been persuadedto leave the company: all the tinkering that passes for restructuring seemsto have improved nothing.andP;  In desperation, IBM is turning for succour to itsarch-enemy, Apple Computer Inc - but is it prepared to contemplate therevolution in thinking necessary for success? It's hardly John Akers' faultthat IBM is where it is today - its plight is as keen as that of the SovietUnion: is it Mikhail Gorbachev's fault that he was brought up a communist,and that communism has been proved not to work?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
