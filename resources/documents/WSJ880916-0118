Barrett (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ARO BCY </IN><G> DEF JUS </G><DATELINE> PHILADELPHIA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seven former officials of United Chem Con Corp., a Lancaster, Pa., defense contractor, were indicted by a federal grand jury here for allegedly defrauding the Defense Department of more than $16 million between 1982 and 1987.    The eight-count indictment, announced by Tom Lee, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charges that Chem Con officials falsified payment requests and test results in connection with contracts to build cargo containers and fuse cables for bombs. The indictment also alleges that certain company officials conspired to evade tax payments and received illegal kickbacks from subcontractors. Mr. Lee said the defendants would be arraigned next week.    Separately, federal prosecutors in New York said that a former U.S. Navy official had agreed to plead guilty to charges that he conspired to accept bribes from both Chem Con and Wedtech Corp., a defunct New York defense contractor. Wedtech has been the focus of a massive government corruption investigation that so far has resulted in at least nine criminal convictions and guilty pleas, including the conviction of former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi.    According to prosecutors in New York, Richard D. Ramirez, former director of the Navy's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to receive $60,000 in bribes from Wedtech in exchange for helping the company obtain a $135 million contract to build pontoons. Mr. Ramirez also arranged to receive bribes of $120,000 from Chem Con in exchange for assisting the company in getting a $54 million contract to make cargo containers and other equipment, prosecutors said.    Both Chem Con and Wedtech received the contracts under a federal program that sets aside business for small businesses owned by minorities. Beneficiaries of the program don't have to bid competitively.    Chem Con, a closely held firm, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection and isn't operating, prosecutors said.    Prosecutors said the investigation of Chem Con isn't linked to a continuing nationwide inquiry into fraud and influence-peddling at the Pentagon. But they said the investigation of Chem Con's practices is continuing and could result in more indictments.    Among the Chem Con officials charged yesterday was the company's former president and chief executive officer, James B. Christian. Neither Mr. Christian nor any of the other people indicted could be reached for comment.    Maximum penalties for the defendants are prison terms ranging from 10 to 48 years and fines of $500,000 to $1.75 million, prosecutors said. </TEXT></DOC>
