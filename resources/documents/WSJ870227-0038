Glenfed, the nation's fifth-largest thrift, would increase its assets to $21 billion from the current $18 billion and receive Fresno-based Guarantee's 41 branches, mostly in the San Joaquin Valley, where Guarantee long has been the leading savings and loan. Norman Coulson, Glenfed's president, said the acquisition fills &quot;the one major gap in California&quot; for the 176-office Glenfed network.    But some analysts questioned the $33-a-share price it is paying for Guarantee. &quot;Maybe the bidding got carried away,&quot; said Alan G. Bortel, a San Francisco-based analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. He said that at Guarantee's expected earnings rate for 1987, it might take at least two years for the acquisition to eliminate the dilutive effect on Glenfed's stock.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Glenfed shares closed at $31.875, off 87.5 cents a share. Guarantee shares closed at $30.125, up $3.375 in national over-the-counter trading.    The two companies wouldn't say what other companies had submitted bids for Guarantee, although Mr. Coulson said Glenfed's offer won out by &quot;a hair's breadth&quot; over the nearest competitor. While a Guarantee spokesman said only that the company had been approached by &quot;more than half a dozen&quot; companies, analysts said that large California thrifts such as H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., Calfed Inc. and Great Western Financial Corp. probably were among them.    Guarantee's chairman, Lewis S. Eaton, and members of his family control about 40% of the thrift, and until recently hadn't shown any interest in selling. Mr. Eaton said he expects Glenfed to retain the Guarantee name for its San Joaquin Valley operations.    Mr. Coulson said Glenfed, parent of Glendale Federal Savings andamp; Loan, continues to study expansion in Florida, the Southwest and the Pacific Northwest.    He defended the price for Guarantee as warranted by the thrift's strategic location, its earnings outlook and the important role of its Gesco Corp. data-processing operation. Gesco, the nation's fourth-largest computer company servicing the savings and loan industry, probably was worth about $60 million by itself, the executive said. He also noted that in valuing companies, computer servicing operations carry far higher multiples than do thrift operations.    &quot;Next year this will look like a more than reasonable buy for us,&quot; Mr. Coulson said.    He noted that Guarantee's 1986 earnings were unusually low for the industry mainly because losses on options trading reduced net income by $13 million, to $8 million, or $1.31 a share. Net income was down 43% from 1985.    For its fiscal first half ended Dec. 31, Glenfed had net income of $63.5 million, or $2.91 a share, up 54% from a year earlier. Net income in the 1986 half included a charge of $3.2 million, while year-earlier results included a $7.8 million tax credit.    Glenfed said the number of its shares exchanged for each of Guarantee's 6.2 million shares couldn't be lower than 0.9677 of a share or higher than 1.1828 of a share. It said the acquisition will be accounted for as a merger on a pooling of interest basis.    Mr. Bortel, the Shearson analyst, said he expects Guarantee to earn $24 million to $25 million this year, but added that it &quot;needs to be earning about $37 million for this to be a nondilutive deal.&quot; The analysts said that &quot;over the next two years Glenfed is going to have to show what they can do with this acquisition.&quot;    Gerald Haims, an analyst with Los Angeles-based Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., said he believed Glenfed will benefit from the loyal nature of depositors in central California, &quot;who aren't just in hot-money jumbos and won't fly when the rates move.&quot; He said he expects Glenfed to earn about $5.50 a share for the year ending June 30, but added that earnings could exceed $7 a share in fiscal 1988, when Guarantee's results are included. </TEXT></DOC>
