In addition to this issue of limits on IRS use of subpoenaed material, the justices agreed to take up in the same case the question of when material is exempt from IRS subpoenas because of attorney-client privilege.    The questions are presented in a Justice Department appeal that represents the latest step in a battle between the IRS and the Church of Scientology, its leaders and its followers.    Since October 1984, the IRS has been trying to obtain records and files on Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and others that are part of the record of a trial in a California state court. When the state court refused to provide 13 documents, the IRS went to federal court to enforce its subpoena.    A federal judge in Los Angeles ordered five of 13 records turned over, but required the IRS to refrain from sharing the subpoenaed records with any other federal agencies unless a criminal prosecution is started.    The judge refused to enforce the subpoena on the eight other records, including taped discussions between Mr. Hubbard's attorneys and other lawyers for the church. The IRS argued that these records weren't covered by the attorney-client privilege, because the privilege doesn't apply to communications promoting fraud. But the judge said the IRS must have evidence apart from the tapes that the discussions involved fraud.    A federal appeals court in San Francisco affirmed both parts of the judge's ruling.    The Justice Department said both aspects of the ruling conflict with other rulings and may &quot;create severe obstacles&quot; for the IRS. Mr. Hubbard died in 1986. (U.S. vs. Zolin)   Gas Contract   The justices let stand a Louisiana state court award of $90 million in damages and $90 million in interest against United Gas Pipe Line Co. in a suit by Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co., a Middle South Utilities Inc. unit. The dispute was over curtailment of natural gas supplied by United Gas to its contract customers during the natural gas shortage of the 1970s. United Gas argued that it was forced by federal regulators to curtail gas shipments and thus shouldn't be held liable for failing to fulfill its supply contracts.    United Gas was acquired in June 1987 by LaSalle Energy Corp., but liability for the lawsuit remains with two Occidental Petroleum Corp. units that previously owned United Gas. (United Gas Pipe Line Co. vs. Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co.)    Hallmark Appeal   The high court left intact a preliminary injunction that bars Hallmark Cards Inc., a closely held, Kansas City, Mo., greeting card manufacturer and industry leader, from selling cards that resemble those of Blue Mountain Arts, a small Boulder, Colo., concern.    The justices refused to hear Hallmark's appeal of a federal appeals court ruling issued last May in Denver. The appeals court upheld a federal district judge's November 1986 order that, until a trial, Hallmark stop marketing 83 &quot;Personal Touch&quot; cards that resemble those of Blue Mountain, known for watercolor designs and emotional messages. (Hallmark Cards Inc. vs. Hartford House Ltd.)    Age Discrimination   The justices will review an Ohio pension system for public employees that permits retirement for workers who meet age and length-of-service rules, but that allows disability retirement -- which carries greater benefits for employees with fewer years of service -- only for employees younger than 60. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati said that the rule violates a federal law barring discrimination in employment based on age. (Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio vs. Betts)   Libel Review   The high court will also review a $200,000 damage award against the Journal News newspaper of Hamilton, Ohio, owned by HHC Holding Co. The award, in a libel case, included $195,000 in punitive damages. The high court must decide whether the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press requires an appeals court to review every factual issue in a libel case, or whether an appeals court should simply review a jury's decision that a newspaper acted with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of a news report. (Harte-Hanks Communications Inc. vs. Connaughton)   Vaccine Liability   The justices let stand the ruling of a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., reinstating a $10 million lawsuit against American Cyanamid Co.'s Lederle Laboratories unit for injuries to an infant girl allegedly caused in 1983 by the company's vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, or pertussis. The appeals court said that although the vaccine has Food and Drug Administration approval, it still is subject to state personal injury laws on defective products. The suit alleges that the vaccine's defect is its use of whole, rather than partial, dead pertussis cells. (American Cyanamid Co. vs. Abbot)   Other Cases   In other actions, the justices:   -- Agreed to decide whether the First Amendment free-speech guarantee protects the burning of an American flag as a protest. A Texas state court threw out a criminal conviction for a flag-burning that occurred during the 1984 Republican Convention in Dallas. (Texas vs. Johnson)   --Let stand the conviction of reputed Philadelphia mob boss Nicodemo Scarfo for conspiracy to commit extortion. He is serving a 14-year prison sentence and was also fined $150,000. (Scarfo vs. U.S.)    --Left intact the espionage and theft convictions of a former U.S. intelligence analyst who gave secret satellite photographs to a British magazine. The court rejected an appeal by Samuel Morison, who is serving a two-year prison sentence for leaking photos of a Soviet aircraft carrier to Jane's Defence Weekly. (Morison vs. U.S.) </TEXT></DOC>
