Representatives of 16 East German political parties,pro-democracy groups and social organizations holding their secondsession on the nation's future said Monday the summit was a sign ofboth hope and a possible danger.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Hans Modrow, theCommunist premier of East Germany, are to meet in Dresden onTuesday and Wednesday.   Kohl has made clear that his government seeks eventualreunification of Germany, which has been divided since 1945.   Modrow and many other East Germans, however, feel joining thetwo states would threaten the stability of Europe and result in a``sellout'' of East German land and industry.   Monday night in Leipzig, about 200 pro-reunification activiststried to disrupt a silent procession of about 200,000 peoplebearing candles to commemorate victims of past intolerance. Theywere hushed quickly.   Delegates to the East German talks said the Kohl-Modrow meetings``express the expectation that the visit will contribute to thebuilding of relations between East Germany and West Germany.''   They alwo warned, however, that Kohl's visit ``may in no caseput the sovereignty or state identity of either German nation inquestion.''   The broad forum includes Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi, aswell as Interim President Manfred Gerlach of the Liberal Democratsand pairs of representatives from the Neues Forum opposition groupand more than a dozen others.   Many of the small parties and citizens' movements arepositioning themselves for the forthcoming election campaign forparliamentary seats, as well as airing their views on how thenation should be reformed after four decades of Communistdomination.   East Germany's first free elections are set for May 6, a resultof the first forum held Dec. 7.   Under pressure from mass pro-democracy protests, East Germany inthe past two months also has ousted its hard-line leaders, openedthe Berlin Wall and other borders, and ushered in reforms.   In West Berlin, the opposition Social Democratic Party openedits national convention Monday, focusing on how the two Germannations should be brought together in the new age of open borders.   Party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel, who is likely to challenge Kohlin federal elections for the West German leadership a year fromnow, said East Germany must be allowed to find its own path.   Vogel appealed for a ``border-transcending solidarity'' toprevent further mass emigration from East Germany.   More than 300,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany in1989, many giving up hope that their state could rectify itsdaunting economic problems or institute democracy in the place ofStalinism.   The westward tide has ebbed somewhat since the borders wereopened Nov. 9 and East Germans were allowed to come and go as theypleased.   But Germans on both sides of the border fear that if visibleimprovement in the lives of East Germans is not achieved soon, theexodus will increase.   Gerlach, who was named interim president Dec. 6 after formerleader Egon Krenz was forced to resign, said the situation is``already critical.''   Gerlach said the basic supply of goods and services to thepublic is threatened after Jan. 1 if labor and distribution are notimproved by then.   An East German newspaper disclosed Monday that a new law ontrade unions to be presented to parliament will include a right tostrike.   Neues Forum on Monday urged both German states to ``recognizethe current borders in Europe.'' The appeal aims to fix the postwarterritorial order in Europe, thereby preventing formalreunification.   ``The major problems facing our world _ securing peace,improving the environment, social and economic issues _ are notsolvable by single states,'' the leading opposition group contended.   Gerlach conceded that despite resistance by both unofficialcitizens' groups and the parties represented in Parliament,reunification is forcing itself into negotiations.   ``There may be no formal negotiations, but in reality it isbeing discussed in both states,'' said Gerlach, who opposes anyunion with West Germany that would result in loss of East Germansovereignty.   The talks got off to a disorderly start, with hundreds of angrydemonstrators shouting outside the ground-floor conference roomwhere the party and citizen group representatives were assembled.Speakers inside couldn't be heard above the noise of protesterschanting through bullhorns that they wanted to be included at thetalks.   ``Anyone who tries to push his participation in this way is notacting in the interests of democracy,'' Gerlach said.   The participants agreed to include nine other groups at thetalks as representatives or observers.   Discussion of proposals for a new constitution and laws on themedia, political groups, campaign funding and other issuesconnected with the reform movement will be carried on state radioand TV, they decided.   They agreed to hold regular meetings Mondays through the interimperiod before elections. But the next regular session was set forDec. 27 in view of the Christmas holiday.   They also decided to meet Friday to discuss economic problemswith Deputy Premier Christa Luft.   Another new political party was founded Monday, adding to thedozens already in existence. The new group named itself Nelken, or``The Cloves,'' and said it would adhere to traditional Marxistprinciples.</TEXT></DOC>
