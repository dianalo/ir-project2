Phage-mediated intraspeciestransfer of antibiotic resistance markers occurs with a frequency of10{sup -4} to 10{sup -6} per recipient cell. The vector contains linearfragments of double-strained DNA of about 13.5 kilobase pairs, whichappear to be random pieces of bacterial DNA. As yet, neither inductionnor plaque formation has been observed. To the authors' knowledge, asystem of genetic exchange has not been described before for a memberof the sulfate-reducing bacteria.</TEXT></DOC>
