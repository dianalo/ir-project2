The satellite will orbit the Earth on a yearlong mission tostudy the lower atmosphere.   The Scout rocket, a four-stage, solid-fuel booster, rose in aplume of fire and smoke into a cloudless sky beneath a quarter moon.   The launch at 10:55 p.m. came 12 hours after an originaldaylight launch was postponed. Weather forecasters had predicted athunderstorm, which did not materialize.   Aboard the 522-pound satellite was equipment from NASA's GoddardSpace Flight Center in Maryland to measure the electric fieldoutside the craft.   Another experiment from the University of Texas will measure hotgases and ion winds surrounding the spacecraft.   The Italian space agency sent a device designed to measure dragforces on the orbiting satellite, and the West German space agencysent equipment to measure solar ultraviolet radiation and radiationof interplanetary and intergalactic origin.   The satellite, which will be monitored from a control room inRome, will make a complete loop around the Earth, above theequator, every 100 minutes.   Friday night's launch was the first from the Italian-run SanMarco Equatorial Range since 1974.   The range, 90 miles north of the port city of Mombasa, wasestablished in 1965 and has been the site of eight previouslaunches, all of them involving Scout rockets.   The University of Rome operates the range. Friday's launch wasconducted in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.   The San Marco platform, named for the patron saint ofnavigators, is three miles offshore and similar to those used inoffshore drilling.   The Scout rocket is one of the most reliable ones used by NASA.Friday night's launch was the 53rd success out of 54 attempts inthe past 20 years, NASA officials said.   The launch had been postponed from last week because ofmechanical problems.</TEXT></DOC>
