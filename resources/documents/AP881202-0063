North'sremaining challenges to Iran-Contra charges against him, but theReagan administration's refusal to release classified document couldstill scuttle the major charges.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell rejected the last of theformer White House aide's pre-trial motions. North had moved todismiss charges that he obstructed congressional inquiries intopress reports he was violating a ban on helping the Nicaraguanrebels, known as Contras.   Gesell's rulings capped a series of decisions on North's 37pre-trial motions that left intact 14 of the 16 charges against theformer National Security Council aide.   But major counts against North could be dropped if Gesell decidesthe defense cannot argue its case without classified documents beingwithheld by the Reagan administration.   President Reagan insists that the documents are being withheldfor national security reasons, and says the decision is not a ployto prevent North from going to trial.   ``The things we're blocking are the things that duty requires weblock,'' Reagan said Thursday. ``These are things that are nationalsecurity secrets.''   Asked if the move were a backdoor maneuver to keep the caseagainst North from going to trial, he replied: ``No, this issomething that from the very beginning we knew we would have to do.''   Reagan was questioned at the beginning of a meeting onforthcoming trade talks. Although he defended the decision towithhold documents from the trial, he backed away from his previousinsistence that North and his former boss, John M. Poindexter, areinnocent.   On June 27, Reagan had said: ``I believe in the innocence of thetwo men and I would like to see that established once and for all.''   On Thursday, Reagan said, ``At this stage I don't think I shouldcomment on guilt or innocence or anything of this kind. I think thelaw has got to take its course.''   Still, the decision to withhold classified documents could enableNorth's lawyers to claim that he is being prevented from presentinga full defense to the key allegation against him _ that he conspiredillegally to divert more than $14 million in profits from the Reaganadministration's secret Iranian weapons deals to the NicaraguanContra rebels.   North's lawyers claim that they need some 40,000 pages of secretdocuments to defend him. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, thespecial prosecutor assigned to the case, has indicated he canproceed without use of the classified information.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said heads of governmentagencies concerned with national security decided in July not torelease some material sought for the trial. He said Walsh indicatedat the time that he could prosecute North on the basis ofunclassified material.   North's lawyers, however, are insisting on use of the classifiedmaterial. Gesell today resumed closed hearings on defense objectionsto deleting classified material from 350 prosecution exhibits.   The secret materials bear most heavily on two charges relating tothe diversion _ conspiracy and theft of government property.However, North also could be tried on charges he made falsestatements to Congress and conspired to use a tax-exempt foundationfor a non-exempt purpose _ raising money for the Contras.   In a court filing made public late Thursday, Walsh disclosed someof the types of information that the Reagan administration ispreventing him from using. It includes the already widely publicizednames of several Central American countries, and the names ofofficials from those nations, involved in aiding the Contras.   Walsh's document also indicates that the administration is tryingto suppress the names of nations from which it tried to solicitsecret contributions for the Contras, including Saudi Arabia andSouth Korea.   Fitzwater said the White House has offered a briefing to U.S.District Judge Gerhard Gesell, who is scheduled to preside overNorth's trial, but had not received a response. Fitzwater said itwas ``up to the judge'' to decide if the classified material isrelevant to North's defense and, if it is, whether the indictmentsagainst him should be dismissed or he should be tried.   Gesell said recently that he would have little power to controlthe flow of information once the trial started, but noted that theWhite House had legal and constitutional means at its disposal toprevent disclosures.   Fitzwater said White House officials realized, when they heardthis, that Gesell had not been advised of the action that had beentaken in July.   Consequently, White House Counsel A.B. Culvahouse wrote Walsh aletter on the issue. Of the 40,000 or so pages sought by North, theadministration advised Walsh that ``there is information in thosedocuments that we know we cannot declassify,'' Fitzwater said.   Reagan, meanwhile, reiterated that he is opposed to apresidential pardon for North and the other Iran-Contra defendantswhile the criminal case is pending. He said pardons would leave them``under a shadow of guilt for the rest of their lives.''</TEXT></DOC>
