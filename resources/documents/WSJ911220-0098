Those charges included a new federal indictment, allegingthat BCCI secretly acquired control and influence over FirstAmerican Bankshares Inc., Washington, D.C.; Independence Bankof Encino, Encino, Calif.; and National Bank of Georgia,Atlanta.</LP><TEXT>   The plea agreement, Attorney General William Barr said ata news conference here, &quot;is the result of an intense andunprecedented cooperative effort involving federal, state andinternational law enforcement and regulatory agencies.&quot; At anews conference in New York, Manhattan District AttorneyRobert Morgenthau whose office indicted BCCI in July, saidimproved access to BCCI documents &quot;will expedite the balanceof the investigation.&quot;   The agreement means that no additional federal or statecharges will be filed against the bank, but it allowscontinued investigation of individuals associated with eitherthe bank or its parent, BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. Theliquidators needed the accord with U.S. authorities beforeproceeding with an orderly liquidation of the bank and itsassets.   Under the settlement, the U.S. assets of BCCI Holdings,which mostly consist of cash and other liquid investments ondeposit in New York, will be roughly divided into two. Half,or about $275 million, will be put into a fund to provideadditional capital to First American and Independence Bank.   As much as $5 million would be made available toIndependence Bank immediately, and $10 million will be usedto pay a fine imposed by a New York court and to compensatelaw enforcement agencies' costs. The Federal DepositInsurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve will decide whethermoney from the fund is needed, and will apply for it to theattorney general.   The other half of the U.S. assets will be put into a fundand distributed to depositors in other countries who lostmoney when the bank was seized by this past July 5 byregulators from several Western countries. There also will bea screening process to try to ensure that compensation isn'tpaid to people involved in criminal activity.   As part of the settlement, however, BCCI won't have to paya $200 million civil penalty assessed earlier this year bythe Fed for BCCI's alleged breaches of banking regulations.   The U.S. government thinks it has considerable leverage toensure that it gets the documents and cooperation it isseeking from the liquidators. The liquidators and foreigndepositors &quot;don't get a dime out of this plea agreementunless we're satisfied that we're getting the cooperation wewant,&quot; said Ira Raphaelson, the Justice Department's specialcounsel for financial institutions fraud.   The Bush administration had been eager to reach asettlement. It has been driven by fears for the well-being ofFirst American and Independence Bank, and wanted to ensurethat neither falters before next year's elections.   &quot;Without this agreement, it's clear that at least one ofthese banks, Independence, could have failed at any time,&quot;said Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.). That, he added, would haverequired &quot;an immediate taxpayer bailout.&quot;   But Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who heads the Housesubcommittee on crime, criticized the pact for not includingAbu Dhabi, whose rulers own a majority of BCCI and FirstAmerican. He added that &quot;nothing in the agreement clearlyaddresses missing, if not destroyed, documents.&quot;   Fred Davis, a lawyer at the New York law firm Shearman andamp;Sterling and a negotiator for BCCI's liquidators, said theliquidators faced a dilemma, in that providing furtherevidence to U.S. investigators before this agreement mighthave provided grounds for bringing further charges againstthe bank.   Despite yesterday's settlement, civil cases against theseized bank and its liquidators continue in various U.S.jurisdictions. Those litigants didn't seem to like the newsettlement. &quot;This is once again a monumental loss to thetaxpayers and citizens of the United States,&quot; said JamesDougherty, counsel for Lloyd's of London, the insuranceexchange, which is involved in civil proceedings against BCCIin Miami. &quot;The true amount of damage to the taxpayers wewould estimate would exceed $10 billion,&quot; he said.   The settlement, which was negotiated jointly by officialsfrom the Justice Department and the Manhattan districtattorney's office, also seemed to confirm the recentimprovement in cooperation between federal and stateinvestigators working on the case. Asked about his previouscriticism of the Justice Department, the 72-year-old Mr.Morgenthau joked with reporters &quot;I have a very short memory.It may be a sign of my age. We've had excellent cooperationin the past month -- I can't remember beyond that.&quot;   ---   Wade Lambert in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
