Linse, Division ofEconomic Analysis, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K StreetNW., Washington, DC 20581, telephone (202) 254-7303.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The live cattle futures contract currentlyprovides that delivery may be made at approved livestock yards in Peoria,Illinois; Omaha, Nebraska; Sioux City, Iowa; Dodge City, Kansas; Amarillo,Texas; and Greeley, Colorado. In addition, the existing terms of the futurescontract provide that delivery can be made at Joliet, Illinois throughthe December 1989 contract month. The amendment, which would eliminatePeoria, Illinois as a live cattle futures delivery point, has been proposedto apply all existing and subsequently listed contract months upon Commissionapproval. The CME bases its action on the view of its Live Cattle Committee thatPeoria, Illinois should be eliminated immediately from the list of deliverypoints for the live cattle futures contract because it appears that thedelivery facility at Peoria ``* * * is no longer a viable stockyard * **.'' In particular, the CME notes that, beginning on July 3, 1989, thePeoria Union Stock Yards reduced its live cattle market to sales on Mondaysonly. The CME also submits that, although the stockyards at Peoria willaccommodate futures deliveries on all other weekdays, long traders willbe extremely disadvantaged when disposing of cattle received on futuresdelivery at Peoria on days other than Monday because cattle buyers arenot likely to be present on any day except Monday. In addition, the CME notes that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)has advised the CME that its cattle graders will no longer be present eachday at the Peoria facility. The CME notes that, although USDA graders canbe made available in Peoria for grading futures delivery cattle on dayswhen such graders would not otherwise be present, making graders availablein Peoria on such days will involve an additional expense which will bethe responsibility of the short trader. The CME contends, accordingly,that this situation has the impact of making Peoria less economical asa delivery point than other existing delivery points for the futures contract.The CME also notes that annual saleable cattle receipts at the Peoria Stockyardhave been steadily declining over time, with annual cattle receipts falling78.3 per cent from 1976 to 1988. In support of its proposal to make the deletion of Peoria effective immediatelyfor all currently listed contract months, the CME notes that the recentreduction in live cattle sales at Peoria to one day per week affects allcurrently listed contract months and believes that this recent change inoperations ``* * * effectively eliminates Peoria as a viable delivery point* * *.'' Therefore, the CME believes it is necessary to implement the proposalimmediately to prevent any possible delivery problems with currently listedcontract months. The Division specifically solicits comment on the following questions:(1) To what extent, if any, will the deletion of the Peoria delivery pointaffect deliverable supplies for the CME's live cattle futures contractand the contract's susceptibility to price manipulation or market congestion?(2) What delivery problems, if any, are likely to result for either longor short traders if Peoria is retained as a live cattle futures deliverypoint? (3) If the Peoria delivery point is to be deleted, how should this changebe implemented? For example, should the proposal apply exclusively to newlylisted months or should it apply to certain currently listed contract monthsas well? If application to currently listed months is appropriate, shouldthis amendment be applied immediately with respect to all currently listedcontract months (<T3>i.e., </T3>commencing with the first contract month that expires afterthe date the CME implements the amendment)? Alternatively, should thisamendment be applied to only those currently listed contract months thatexpire after a specified time period following the implementation datefor the amendment and, if so, what such period is appropriate (<T3>e.g., </T3>all existing contract months that expire more than six monthsafter the implementation date)? Copies of the proposed amendment will be available for inspection at theOffice of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 KStreet NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the amended terms and conditionscan be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the aboveaddress or by telephone at (202) 254-6314. The materials submitted by the CME in support of the proposed amendmentmay be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act(5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR Part145 (1987)). Requests for copies of such materials should be made to theFOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariatat the Commission's headquarters in accordance with CFR 145.7 and 145.8.Any person interested in submitting written data, views or arguments onthe proposed amendments should send such comments to Jean A.
