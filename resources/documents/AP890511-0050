Before having embryos frozen, couples should legally documenttheir wishes on such questions as what to do with the embryos ifthe parents divorce or die during the process, said Dr. MichaelVergare.   Other issues include what should happen to stored embryos if thewoman enters menopause and can no longer be implanted with them,said Vergare, associate chairman of the psychiatry department atthe Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia.   Vergare spoke at a news conference and in an interview Wednesdayat the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.   Such ethical questions are beginning to appear in the nation'scourtrooms.   A Los Angeles-area couple on Wednesday sued a Norfolk, Va.,in-vitro fertilization center for refusing to release an embryothat was frozen 23 months ago.   The couple want to remove their embryo from the Jones Institutefor Reproductive Medicine so that a California doctor can attemptto implant it in the woman.   In another case, the divorce of a Tennessee couple has turnedinto a battle over custody of seven of the woman's eggs that arefertilized with her husband's sperm and kept in frozen storage. AKnoxville court has scheduled a hearing in July to determine if theembryos are ``joint property'' of Mary Sue Davis and Junior LewisDavis, or subjects for a custody decision.   Good embryo-freezing programs provide legal documents that dealwith such issues, as well as others such as what to do with embryosif the organization that is storing them goes out of business,Vergare said.   At his institution, couples are required to ponder the issuesbefore proceeding with the freezing, he said.   Embryo-freezing has become part of in-vitro fertilizationprograms, with which normally infertile couples can have childrenwith the help of egg-fertilizing in the laboratory.   Virtually every major city now offers programs withembryo-freezing, said Vergare, who is psychiatric consultant to theEinstein center's in-vitro program.   Babies born so far from frozen embryos have appeared generallyhealthy and normal, Vergare said. The technique has been usedsucessfully in animal husbandry for years, but whether it willprove to have long-term effects in people is unknown, he said.   ``Cows aren't expected to study algebra,'' he said.   In the case filed in federal court in Norfolk, Steven and RisaYork asked for $200,000 for alleged emotional damages and theimmediate release of their embryo.   Between August 1986 and July 1987, when the couple lived in NewJersey, Ms. York went to the institute four times to attemptin-vitro fertilization. Doctors managed to fertilize 12 of hereggs, and 11 of those were implanted without success, according tocourt papers.   The 12th embryo was frozen for future implantation, but theYorks moved to California and later notified Dr. Suheil J. Muasher,director of the Jones Institute, that they wanted to take thefrozen embryo to Los Angeles, where local doctors would implant it.   Dr. Howard W. Jones Jr., co-founder and president of theinstitute, said agreeing to the Yorks' request could set aprecedent by forcing the release of fertilized eggs to doctors whomight be unqualified to perform the procedure.</TEXT></DOC>
