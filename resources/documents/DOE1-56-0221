Thermodynamicand thermophysical properties were determined by adiabatic heat-capacitycalorimetry, comparative ebulliometry, densimetry, and combustion calorimetry.Vibrational spectra of quinoline and isoquinoline were assigned. Entropiesand enthalpies for the ideal-gas state from the calorimetric measurementsand from the vibrational assignments were derived and compared. Entropies,enthalpies, and Gibbs energies of formation were derived at selectedtemperatures between T{yields}0 and 1000 K. New density measurementsfor benzene are reported. 55 refs., 11 figs., 16 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
