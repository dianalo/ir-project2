(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Weapons charges against an attorney whoclaimed authorities entrapped him in a federally financedundercover drug investigation were dismissed Monday by a judge whofound governmental misconduct in the case.   The judge said law enforcement officers should not have filedfalse charges against an undercover sheriff's deputy so he couldhire attorney Robin Auld of Durango to represent him as part of theoperation.   Filing the false affidavits was ``an impermissible taint uponthe integrity and impartiality of the courts,'' Judge Richard Brownwrote.   Auld said he was ``very happy'' with Brown's ruling but didn'twant to comment further because of a possible appeal by KeithCross, the special prosecutor in the case.   A notice of claim seeking at least $1 million in civil damageshas been filed on Auld's behalf, but the attorney has not yetbrought a formal lawsuit. The government plan had called for theundercover officer to pay Auld in drugs for his legal services, andthen pressure Auld to ``set up'' drug traffickers in southwestColorado, testimony in previous hearings showed.   Auld, 43, refused to accept drugs but later took possession ofan Uzi machine gun, testimony showed. The prosecution charged hetook the gun as payment; Auld contends he kept it as collateral.   The gun belonged to the Durango Police Department on loan fromthe FBI, according to court documents.   Auld's trial was to have started next Monday in Durango.   Brown, who heard the case after 6th Judicial District judges inDurango disqualified themselves, said law enforcement officials mayhave committed perjury when they filed the false charges as part oftheir operation.   ``This court is not aware of any case or statute which sanctionsthe filing of false and perjured documents in an official courtproceeding as part of an undercover operation,'' Brown wrote.   ``The public has a right to demand and to expect that the courtswill do their utmost to remain impartial and to promote thepublic's confidence in the integrity of the courts,'' Brown said.   ``It takes guts but it's the right thing. He (Brown) wouldn'tput up with the corruption of court records,'' said Hal Haddon ofDenver, Auld's defense lawyer.   Cross, the special prosecutor, said he will appeal.   ``If this decision stands, it means the attorney never has toface a jury on fairly serious charges,'' Cross said.   Cross said he considered the false affidavits before he chargedAuld with theft by receiving and possession of a dangerous weapon.   ``In my opinion, there were no indictable offenses committed bythe DA or law enforcement officials,'' Cross said. ``There is noquestion that two documents filed and sworn to weren't true, but Ibelieve there is a difference in doing that and taking the standand perjuring themselves.''   The operation was conducted as part of a $70,000 drug programfunded by the federal government, testimony showed.</TEXT></DOC>
