After completediagnostic angiography, urokinase (200,000-750,000 units) was infuseddirectly into the basilar artery (two patients) or the involved vertebralartery (three patients). In three patients there was marked angiographicimprovement with nearly complete dissolution of the thrombus; however,only one patient improved clinically. Two patients had no change in theirclinical course. Two others became acutely worse, one because of intracerebralhemorrhage and one because of massive cerebellar infarction. This treatmentmay be of help in patients with basilar artery thrombosis who alreadyhave a grave prognosis.</TEXT></DOC>
