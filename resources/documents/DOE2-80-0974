<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-80-0974 </DOCNO><TEXT>Lists the measures taken to modernize and replace equipment at one ofthe most important machine building plants for the power industry inthe USSR. Emphasis is being placed on the introduction of modern, abrasion-resistant,corrosion-proof heating surfaces with a lower metal content (e.g. membraneeconomizers, ceramic packing), increasing service life of certain boilercomponents (to 200,000 h), increasing efficiency, reducing overall metalconsumption, introduction of microelectronics and microprocessors incontrol systems. Describes development and introduction of large steam-gasinstallations such as the 1100 MW PGU-1100 comprising two GTEh-150 gasturbines with a steam boiler with a capacity of 2650 t/h and steam parameters25 MPa, 545/542 C and a K-800-240 steam turbine. Great importance isplaced on the production of large steam boilers for export such as theTPE-217/VSO boiler with a steam generating capacity of 640 t/h for usewith 200 MW power units which is exported to India, and the TGME-206(for 200 MW power units) which is exported to Syria, Algeria and Iraq,although several problems are being encountered in connection with theplanned intensification of the export trade. Automated design systemsare being introduced to reduce the development period for new technologyand it is hoped that by 1990 45% of all design work will be automated.2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
