The dress fit, but some of the stitching along the zipper split open.    Janice Miller, a market researcher, was irked by the lining on a $200 Evan-Picone wool skirt she bought at Saks Fifth Avenue in Chicago. After one season of wear, the lining started to fray. Ms. Miller had to pay her tailor $30 to replace it.    Buttons are Ross Stemer's problem. The second time the corporate public-relations man wore a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt, the threads came loose and a button flew off. He lost a button on his London Fog raincoat the first time he put it on. &quot;It's distressing when you pay money for a top brand to have something like that happen,&quot; he says.    Complaints about &quot;better&quot; garments like these are on the rise. Seams are splitting, buttons are falling off and collars are puckering in the wash. &quot;You used to be able to assume that things that cost more might be better,&quot; says Peter Glen, a consultant to and critic of the retailing and fashion industries. &quot;That's not true anymore. Now the standard is poor quality.&quot;    Manufacturers, of course, disagree. &quot;All of the manufacturers try to provide a better-quality product to the customer,&quot; says C.B. Ross, a quality official at Capital Mercury Shirt Co. and former chairman of the quality committee of the American Apparel Manufacturers Association. &quot;The consumer has become more aware of problems that they have had all along.&quot; Mr. Ross says manufacturers haven't changed their rule of thumb of holding defective garments to less than 1% of the total produced, and he says they are still largely meeting that goal.    Complaining about a decline in quality has long been a favorite consumer pastime, but customers are becoming particularly vocal these days about poor workmanship in higher-priced lines, says Paul D. Campbell, a market researcher in Minneapolis who tracks consumers' attitudes for retailers.    One reason: Hefty increases in clothes prices have jolted people into paying more attention. During most of this decade, apparel prices rose slowly, because low-priced imports flooded into the U.S. and domestic manufacturers tried to stay competitive. But last year, the weak dollar and import restrictions on apparel from the Far East started pushing clothing prices up faster than inflation. Further big rises are expected as the weak dollar and strong global demand for wool boost fall and winter clothing prices. For instance, Hickey-Freeman men's wool suits now arriving in stores for the fall season cost 20% more than a year ago.    Higher prices aren't the only reason consumers are squawking. Some manufacturers are responding to rising labor costs and retailers' demands for quicker delivery by skimping on workmanship, materials or quality inspections to keep prices from rising even faster, according to apparel industry analysts.    This fall's offerings, for instance, may include more clothes made from blends of synthetic fibers and wool, instead of pure wool. &quot;A lot of manufacturers have become very sensitive to the impact of price increases,&quot; says Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at the Management Horizons retail consulting unit of Price Waterhouse. &quot;One way to keep prices within the expectations of their customers is to reduce the natural fiber content.&quot;    Bernard Wolford, an industrial engineer and principal with the consulting firm of Kurt Salmon Associates, calls such tradeoffs &quot;value engineering.&quot; But the result can be shoddier merchandise. Osra Noble, assistant manager of New York Cleaners in Washington, D.C., says more seams and hems these days are sewn with synthetic threads that unravel more easily when snagged than cotton threads.    Kurt Barnard, publisher of Retail Marketing Report, got a taste of value engineering when he went shopping recently for a Burberrys raincoat to replace one he bought 12 years ago. The wool lining in the new coat was flimsier than in Mr. Barnard's old coat, and the buttons weren't attached as well. But he says the coat probably would have cost $1,200, instead of the $800 the store was actually charging, if it had matched the old coat in quality.    In women's clothing, fit is becoming a big issue. Retailers and consultants say some manufacturers are having trouble adjusting to the new styles, which are supposed to fit closer to the body than the oversized and layered looks that were popular during most of this decade. The result: Women are finding arm holes that are too far forward or too far back, and darts that don't lead properly to the bosom, according to Marjorie Deane, a fashion consultant who publishes Tobe Report. &quot;Things just don't fit,&quot; she says.    World-wide manufacturing compounds the problem. Clothing from the same line often is produced in several countries, making it difficult for apparel companies to offer goods of consistent quality.    But the mindset of the fashion and retailing industries also is a factor, particularly in women's wear. Instead of focusing on quality, manufacturers and retailers tend to concentrate on trendy clothes with shorter life spans than in the past -- in both style and quality -- as a way to keep customers coming back.    Consider what Irwin Kahn, an industry consultant and dean of business and technology at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, says about how long clothes should last. &quot;If the manufacturer believes he is making fashion merchandise,&quot; Mr. Kahn contends, &quot;his concern should be for the season and not beyond it.&quot; That's because &quot;if it's truly fashion, it's going to be out of style&quot; the following year.    That attitude makes prices more dependent on designer names, new fabric colors or proprietary prints than on workmanship. &quot;I personally have had my hands on $150 dresses that from a manufacturing and engineering standpoint are better constructed than similar $300 garments,&quot; says Mr. Wolford, the apparel engineer at Kurt Salmon Associates. &quot;Ten or 15 years ago, paying a certain price for a certain type of garment had more predictability to it.&quot;    When times are good, retailers usually are more interested in hot-selling styles, too. They imitate popular goods, often choosing as manufacturers companies that can make them quickest -- not necessarily best.    Nowadays, though, women's clothing sales are weak and retailers are complaining to manufacturers more often about quality.    That's because clothes that don't sell must be marked down, cutting into retailers' profits, and some poor-quality garments don't sell as well as higher-quality clothes.    Partly to improve quality, retailers such as Dayton Hudson Corp. are ordering more private-label merchandise, which is manufactured to a retailer's specifications. The Marshall Field department store unit of B.A.T Industries PLC also has sales clerks in each of its stores try on clothes when they arrive so it can return garments that don't meet the chain's standards. &quot;What you see in the showroom isn't necessarily what arrives at the store,&quot; says Salvatore Ruggiero, the chain's fashion director. Sometimes the fabric isn't as heavy as the one buyers saw, he says, or the lining in sleeves of coats and jackets may be twisted so much that a garment can't be worn.    Another sign of the times is the way successful companies with reputations for quality are pitching their wares these days. Lands' End Inc., a cataloger in Dodgeville, Wis., fills its books with descriptions of manufacturing techniques that it says set its clothes apart from most store-bought merchandise. For instance, a recent catalog says the Lands' End T-shirt is made of &quot;beefy&quot; cotton jersey, with features such as &quot;taped shoulder seams that fight 'rip outs.'&quot;    In a message to customers in a catalog this year, the company's chairman and founder, Gary Comer, explains that prices of some imported goods have risen because of the weak dollar. &quot;We will never, ever take quality out of a product,&quot; he promises, &quot;as a means of holding price.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
