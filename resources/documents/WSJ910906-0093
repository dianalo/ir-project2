In a breakthrough for wind power, a Midwest utility and awind-power company tentatively plan to develop the firstmajor U.S. wind-energy project outside California.</LP><TEXT>   If a study over coming months shows the idea is practical,Iowa-Illinois Gas andamp; Electric Co. and U.S. Windpower Inc. planto jointly develop &quot;wind farms&quot; in or near Iowa to generatepower for area utilities, says Stan Bright, chairman,president and chief executive officer of Iowa-Illinois, whichis based in Davenport, Iowa. &quot;There's a lot of evidence thewind resource exists&quot; for the project, he adds.   The proposed joint venture initially would invest $200million to $225 million to obtain rights to place windturbines on agricultural land and to build enough turbines togenerate 250 megawatts of power, says Gerald Alderson,president of San Francisco-based Kenetech Co., U.S.Windpower's parent. After five years, the project may beexpanded to 500 megawatts -- the equivalent of a coal-firedgenerating plant.   The project would open a new frontier for wind farming,which employs clusters of huge propellers on towers to spingenerators and produce electricity. Until now, wind power hasbeen limited mainly to three windy passes in California. Overthe past decade, wind-turbine costs have plummeted while themachines' efficiency has risen. Recently, wind power hasbecome economically competitive with power from coal, oil andother fuels in many places that once weren't consideredpractical for wind farms. Sixteen states, including Iowa,have wind-energy potential equal to or greater thanCalifornia's, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.   The Iowa wind project will employ a new generation ofturbines that can produce electricity for about five cents akilowatt-hour, including initial capital costs, says Mr.Alderson. Energy experts say this new &quot;five-cent machine&quot;could do for wind energy what Henry Ford did for the car --it puts wind on a par with coal power, the cheapesttraditional alternative. Moreover, it makes wind powercheaper than coal power if air pollution and otherenvironmental costs are taken into account. Such &quot;hidden&quot;costs, which a growing number of states require utilities toconsider in long-term planning, are estimated to add at leastseveral cents a kilowatt-hour to the cost of electricity fromcoal.   &quot;From bids we've made in 1991, it's clear we'reapproaching the point where wind will be the energy resourcethat others have to beat&quot; to get utility contracts for newgenerating facilities, says Alexander Ellis, U.S. Windpower'svice president, marketing.   To be sure, wind energy isn't expected to become asignificant power source nationally for at least a decade.Most utilities regard it skeptically, because they &quot;are usedto generating plants that you can turn on and off&quot; whendesired, says Carl Weinberg, manager of research anddevelopment at Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., which has helpedpioneer wind power in California. But like hydropower, windpower &quot;has patterns that {utilities} can recognize and dealwith.&quot;   Indeed, at certain times during the summer, Pacific Gas,the nation's largest utility, gets up to 8% of its power fromthe wind. California wind farms now have a capacity of some1,500 megawatts -- enough for a city the size of SanFrancisco. About half of that goes to Pacific Gas, which mayincrease its use of wind power to the equivalent of severallarge nuclear-power plants as demand rises after 2000, saysMr. Weinberg.   Despite its advantages, wind power has had a turbulenttakeoff in California. In the early 1980s, state and federaltax incentives there inspired &quot;a lot of flaky, ill-advised&quot;wind-energy projects, says U.S. Windpower's Mr. Alderson.Rotor blades broke off some poorly designed turbines, rotorslost efficiency after getting encrusted with dead insects andsome were put at the wrong height to get the most out oflocal winds. The tax breaks ended in the mid-1980s, and awind industry shakeout followed. Worse, the problems hadgiven wind power &quot;an overall negative image&quot; among utilities,adds Mr. Alderson.   But U.S. Windpower and some other wind companies continuedto follow a steeply rising learning curve, says Robert H.Williams, an energy researcher at Princeton University.Unlike traditional power sources, wind energy involvesrelatively simple, cheap equipment amenable to cost-cuttingthrough mass production. Moreover, advances in wind-powertechnology have occurred rapidly due to the &quot;short timebetween design and field tests,&quot; he says. Wind-power costshave dropped by a factor of 10 since the early 1980s.   One advance, incorporated in U.S. Windpower's five-centmachine, is turbine-blade shapes developed in a project ledby the federal Solar Energy Research Institute. In tests, theblades squeezed up to 20% more energy from the wind thanblades now widely used, which are based on a design borrowedfrom helicopters. The machine also employs advanced powerelectronics that can help utilities stabilize voltage intheir grids even when the wind turbine isn't working.   The soul of the new machine is a variable-speed rotor,which spins faster as the wind picks up. That enables it tooperate without damaging stress at higher wind speeds thanthe constant-speed rotors found on most older machines,capturing more energy from the wind. Scheduled to go intoproduction in early 1993, the new 33M-VS turbine is beingdeveloped in a $20 million project by U.S. Windpower, PacificGas, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. and the Electric PowerResearch Institute, a utility-funded center in Palo Alto,Calif.   Even without the latest technology, wind energy has begunto win friends in the utility industry as a way ofdiversifying power portfolios to lessen fuel-price shocks,says Dan Juhl, founder of Minnesota Windpower Inc., aMarshall, Minn., company that is developing small windprojects with used California turbines.   Wind power also appeals to ranchers, who receive royaltiesfor wind harvested on their land by turbines that share spacewith grazing cattle. In California's Altamont Pass, windprojects have raised land values by up to $2,000 an acre,notes Pacific Gas's Mr. Weinberg.   But realizing wind energy's promise outside Californiawill require new power lines to carry electricity from hugewind farms in remote places to population centers. New lines,in turn, won't be warranted until huge projects withthousands of turbines are developed. Utilities aren'texpected to plow money into such projects until they &quot;havelots of experience&quot; with wind power, says U.S. Windpower'sMr. Alderson.   Thus, he predicts the 1990s will be a transition decadefor wind power, during which dozens of utilities develop&quot;relatively modest&quot; wind projects to gather data on how theywork. After that, he adds, wind power should explode,potentially contributing as much as 10% of the nation'selectricity by 2010 or so.</TEXT></DOC>
