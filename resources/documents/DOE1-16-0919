Experiments were conducted to determine if recoveryfrom radiomimetic drugs also resulted in elevation of ZPP. Daily injectionswith hydroxyurea and other cytotoxic drugs for 10 days caused ZPP elevationand a dose of radiation too low to cause ZPP elevation by itself causedZPP elevation when hydroxyurea was administered prior to irradiation.Friend leukemia virus also brought about an elevation of ZPP. However,not all factors that increased erythropoiesis brought about ZPP elevation.The elevated erythropoiesis in response to hypoxia and the enhanced erythropoiesisthat followed administration of folic acid to folic acid-deficient micewas not accompanied by ZPP elevation.</TEXT></DOC>
