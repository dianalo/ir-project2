And even if he did, they still would be better off, he said. Hebuys them from pet stores, where they're sold as food for pet snakes.;   Considering the alternative, the flying is probably OK with the mice, hesaid.;    &quot;They love it,&quot; Butler said. &quot;They don't bite me and don't run awaywhen I get them out of the aircraft.&quot;;    Even so, an animal rights supporteris skeptical.;    &quot;This is something we don't endorse and we don't approve,but it's not technically illegal,&quot; said Sgt. Cori Whetstone of the Society forthe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. &quot;It's a little stupid and unnecessary,and puts the mice in unnecessary risk. But it's not animal cruelty.&quot;;   Butler said he launches the mice-carrying planes several times a week from theoverlook and parks across the city. Guided by radio, the aircraft can stayaloft for several hours at a time.;    The longer they fly, the closer themice get to freedom. After a mouse has logged 50 to 60 hours of flight time,Butler turns it loose in the hills.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Daily News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910310  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  332  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 10, 199100070001,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
