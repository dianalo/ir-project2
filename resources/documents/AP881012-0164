HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A study of AIDS virus screening among militaryrecruits found that only one was wrongly identified as infected,discounting fears that too many people will be mislabeled if thereis widespread testing, a researcher said.   ``The public should know that if they choose to, they can doearly diagnosis of HIV infection cheaply, they can do it in alogistically feasible way and they can do it with a great deal ofaccuracy,'' said Dr. Robert R. Redfield of the Walter Reed ArmyInstitute of Research in Washington.   The latest findings, published in Thursday's New England Journalof Medicine, were based on the first 20 months of militaryscreening of all recruits. Just one of the 135,187 people testedfrom rural areas was misclassified as infected.   The test, which reveals the presence of antibodies formed when aperson is exposed to the AIDS virus, is used to screen donatedblood and also offered by public health agencies to check those athigh risk of the disease, such as homosexual men and drug addicts.   Many of those testing positive for the virus will go on todevelop acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a crippling of thebody's immune system that leaves a person prey to life-threateningcancers and infections. There is no cure.   Experts disagree over whether HIV screening should remainlargely voluntary or whether it should be expanded to includemandatory testing, in some situations, of people at low risk ofAIDS, such as hospital patients.   Opponents argue that, among other things, such broad testingcould falsely label many healthy people as infected. For instance,Dr. Klemens B. Meyer of New England Medical Center has suggestedthat of every 10 low-risk people with positive AIDS tests, nine ofthem might actually be free of the virus.   Redfield, who is one of the nation's most persistent advocatesof widespread testing, said the latest findings show this isuntrue. He believes doctors should routinely check for AIDS just asthey do for cancer, heart disease and other illnesses.   He suggests that AIDS screening be part of routine testing ofhospital patients, pregnant women, marriage license applicants andclients of venereal disease and drug abuse programs. The aim is tospot the HIV infection early, when its symptoms can often becontrolled and when carriers can be persuaded not to spread thedisease to others.   Dr. Harvey Fineberg, dean of the Harvard School of PublicHealth, said that while the latest data help build the case forwidespread screening, they are ``not sufficient to shift thebalance altogether.''   Issues of confidentiality of test results and possiblediscrimination against infected people still must be settled, hesaid. Promoting condom and spermicide use, fighting drug abuse andproviding clean needles are more economical ways to stop the spreadof AIDS.   Dr. Robin Weiss of the Institute of Medicine agreed that despitethe test's accuracy, it should remain voluntary, at least for now.   ``There is no overwhelmingly compelling reason at this moment toendorse mandatory widespread population screening,'' she said,``because the answer to the question, `What is the purpose of thetest, and what would you do with the results?' is unclear. There isno treatment. There is no way to ensure that people will changetheir behavior and not spread the disease.''   Others question whether commercial labs will perform the AIDStest as accurately as the military.   Dr. Lawrence Miike of the Congressional Office of TechnologyAssessment acknowledged the military's ``phenomenally high accuracyrate'' but added: ``I'm not worried about them. I'm worried aboutlabs that advertise, `Come get your HIV test.' I get calls frompeople who say they are the victims of false positives.''   Klemens agreed. ``The question is not how well the bestlaboratories can do,'' he said. ``The issue is how well mostlaboratories are performing, whether they will maintain thisperformance and whether it is good enough.''   To this, Redfield responded, ``I think it's an unusual time whenthe Department of Defense can do things cheaper, quicker and moreaccurate than the private sector.''   Redfield said the military testing has actually improved sincethe first 20 months of the program, and mistakenly false resultsare now probably only one in 1 million. He said the test costs $3per person, and the results are ready within three days.   There have been 74,809 cases of AIDS reported in the UnitedStates since June 1981, according to the Centers for DiseaseControl's Oct. 6 statistics, with 42,142 deaths, or 56 percent ofall cases.</TEXT></DOC>
