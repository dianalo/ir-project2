Neil Sinclair, a British lawyer for Mr. Parnes, said Guinness agreed to allow the stockbroker to retain &quot;a significant balance in respect of fees&quot; that he received from the big British brewer and distiller during the fight for Distillers.    Mr. Sinclair declined to specify whether the #2 million repayment was part of Mr. Parnes's fees or how much money he will keep. A Guinness spokesman declined comment yesterday.    As part of the settlement announced yesterday, Mr. Sinclair said, Guinness didn't request an extension of a freeze on as much as #3.69 million of Mr. Parnes's British assets. Guinness obtained the freeze from a British court earlier this month; it expired yesterday.    In its original request for the freeze, Guinness indicated it believed Mr. Parnes ultimately received some of the #25 million in suspect payments made by Guinness's former top management during or after the Distillers bid.    Mr. Parnes is in prison in Los Angeles, where he was arrested Sept. 30 for allegedly falsifying accounts related to the Distillers bid. Britain is seeking his extradition. Mr. Sinclair said the settlement with Guinness &quot;was in no way related to Mr. Parnes's arrest.&quot;    The British government is investigating whether an illegal share-support scheme helped Guinness succeed in its #2.53 billion, mainly stock bid for Distillers. </TEXT></DOC>
