Fukuzo Nagasaki, director of the semi-governmental Institute ofCetacean Research, said the 300 whales being caught by Japaneseships in the Antarctic this year are not enough to make an accurateassessment of whale stocks and should be increased to 825 nextseason.   Critics have charged that Japan is using the research program tocontinue its whaling industry despite a worldwide moratorium oncommercial whaling imposed in 1986 by the International WhalingCommission.   Japan officially ended its commercial whaling at the end of the1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 whales. The following season ittold the commission it would kill 875 minke and sperm whales forresearch purposes, which are permitted under the commission'scharter.   But strong opposition from international environmental groups andsome commission members led Japan to cut back the research program'sgoal last season to 300 minke whales. Japanese whalers actuallycaught 273 minkes during the year, officials say.   ``The sampling method we applied worked very well, so we are surethat this method can be applied to somewhat larger-scale research,''Nagasaki told reporters at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.``We are thinking of resuming our original plan from next year ifcircumstances permit.''   The whale meat obtained by Japan's research program is sold forfood, as permitted under International Whaling Commissionregulations.   The whaling fleet, made up of one mother ship and three catcherboats, is due to return to Japan from the Antarctic about April 20,he said.   The commission passed the whaling moratorium to allow whalepopulations to be studied without being hunted. The ban is to bere-evaluated by the commission next year, and Japan hopes itsresearch will show that some species, such as the smaller minke, areplentiful enough to allow a limited resumption of commercial whaling.   Current estimates of minke populations range from 400,000 to700,000.</TEXT></DOC>
