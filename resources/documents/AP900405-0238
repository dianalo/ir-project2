A big Northeast shopping mall developer intends to rebuild andexpand the chain starting with the purchase of Bonwit Teller storesin Boston and Buffalo, N.Y., from the current owner, which is inbankruptcy proceedings.   Under agreements announced in bankruptcy court Wednesday, BonwitTeller's parent L.J. Hooker Corp. will break up the chain and sellportions of it piecemeal. L.J. Hooker already liquidated its B.Altman andamp; Co. retail chain as part of its reorganization.   Judge Tina Brozman, who has been overseeing Hooker's Chapter 11bankruptcy proceedings, indicated she will endorse the agreements.   L.J. Hooker attorney Sheldon Hirshon said at a hearing that thecompany would have liked to sell as much of the Bonwit chain aspossible as a going concern, but a potential bid for 13 of the 16stores failed to materialize in time.   Hirshon told the court that Hooker accepted a $22 million bidfrom a consortium of investors, including an entity controlled byreal estate developer Donald Trump, for 5 stores in Boston,Buffalo, New York City, Manhasset, N.Y., and Short Hills, N.J.   The group will close Bonwit's flagship store in Manhattan'sTrump Tower as well as the Manhasset and Short Hills branches.   Consortium member Pyramid Cos., a shopping mall developer andowner based in Syracuse, N.Y., will run the Boston and Buffalostores under the Bonwit Teller name. Also, Pyramid affiliate BontelCorp. will have rights to the Bonwit Teller name and plans to openadditional stores in the future.   Robert J. Congel, Pyramid's managing partner, said the companywould open a new flagship store in Manhattan as part of a plan torebuild the chain. He said Pyramid is seeking a prime location onFifth Avenue.   ``We look forward with great anticipation to rebuilding andrevitalizing Bonwit Teller,'' he said.   Over the next three to five years, Pyramid plans to open BonwitTellers in its retail complexes in Providence, R.I., RocklandCounty, N.Y., Harrisburg, Pa., and Albany, N.Y. The first newBonwit Teller will be opened in October in Carousel Center, acomplex Pyramid is building in Syracuse.   Other members of the consortium are Trump Equitable Fifth Ave.Corp., owner of the commercial space in Trump Tower; PilevskyGroup, a New York property owner, and Prutaub, a venture thatoperates the Mall At Short Hills.   The other Bonwit Teller stores that will continue operating arein Cincinnati and Columbia, S.C. Hooker intends to keep thoserunning because they are located in Hooker-owned malls and closingthem could hurt mall business.   Hooker accepted four separate bids to buy the leases for theBonwit Tellers in Chicago, Oak Brook, Ill., Palm Beach, Fla., andTroy, Mich. All those stores will be closed.   There were no acceptable bids for leases on the stores in BalHarbour, Fla., Kansas City, Mo., Philadelphia, Jenkintown, Pa., andScarsdale, N.Y.   At a May 18 hearing, Hooker will try to dispose of the rest ofthe Bonwit Teller estate including the remaining store leases, thecorporate offices in New York and the distribution center inTotowa, N.J.   Hirshon, the Hooker attorney, said the company promised tovacate all Bonwit premises by June 30.   Bonwit Teller's roots go back to the 1880s when Paul J. Bonwitformed a partnership with Edmund D. Teller. The New York-basedretailer they began built a reputation over the years as an upscalestore specializing in women's fashions.   But in recent years the chain has run into trouble, partlybecause of stiff competition from smaller specialty apparel storesand a generally sluggish retail environment. The company hasstruggled financially since its acquisition by Atlanta-based L.J.Hooker in 1987.   Bonwit Teller lost $2 million on revenue of $149 million in 1988and lost $6 million on revenue of $158 million in 1989. For theyear ended Jan. 31, Bonwit Teller appears to have lost about $21million on $168 million in revenue, according to preliminaryfigures from L.J. Hooker.   The company's corporate parent, Hooker Corp., is based inAustralia. This past summer it went into ``provisionalliquidation,'' an Australian legal proceeding similar tobankruptcy. L.J. Hooker filed for protection from creditors underChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act in August.</TEXT></DOC>
