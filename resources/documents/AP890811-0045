Tim Black, head of the police organized crimebureau. ``These individuals put together a major conspiracy byknowing how to access airline computers to put travel itinerariesin the computer system.''   Investigators believe at least $7 million in airline ticketswere stolen, some during burglaries of travel agencies, Black said.   Arrested Thursday at their Phoenix-area homes were Jurgen ThomosSteinmetz, 31; Rolf Grosse Heitmeyer, 37; his wife, Annedore DoreHeitmeyer, 35; and Karl Heinz Bersuch, 37. Police said theHeitmeyers and Bersuch are citizens of West Germany.   They were booked into the Maricopa County Jail for investigationof conducting an illegal enterprise, conspiracy to traffic instolen property trafficking in stolen property, felony theft, moneylaundering and fraudulent schemes.   Steinmetz was being held on $1 million bond, Bersuch on$411,000, Rolf Heitmeyer on $343,000, and Mrs. Heitmeyer on$274,000.   Police also seized about $80,000 in cash, five vehicles, twohomes and their contents, all of which were believed to have beenpurchased with the proceeds of the stolen-ticket operation, Blacksaid.   Police said more arrests are possible.   The operation was based in Phoenix, but also had offices inHonolulu and Frankfurt, West Germany, police said. They would notsay whether any of those arrested had worked for an airline.   Police became aware of the operation in June after a Los Angeleswoman called to complain about a discount airline ticket she hadpurchased from a Phoenix travel agency that had advertised in anational publication. The undisclosed airline had rejected herticket because it was listed as stolen.   The ads offered ``guaranteed lowest fares'' on internationaldestinations, including Concorde flights, and listed a toll-freenumber.   A majority of the tickets apparently were accepted by theairlines, Black said.   An initial investigation in June resulted in the arrests of twoPhoenix-area men _ Prem Singh, 42, and Vijayant Shishodia _ and theseizure of $50,000 in cash.   Singh remained in the county jail Thursday under $137,000 bond,officials said. He is charged with fraudulent schemes and isscheduled for a pre-trial conference on Aug. 31 in Maricopa CountySuperior Court.   Shishodia has been released from jail and his status was notknown, officials said.   Black said the ticket operations continued as ``strong as ever''after Shishodia and Singh were arrested.</TEXT></DOC>
