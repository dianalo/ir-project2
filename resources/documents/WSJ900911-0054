As part of a broad study of metropolitan America for thePopulation Reference Bureau, University of Michigansociologist William Frey picked out those metropolitan areasexperiencing extra-large gains or losses in baby boompopulation. He defines magnet areas as those with the highestproportion of men and women ages 21 to 40 in their total 1985population and at least a 9.5% increase in this age groupfrom 1980 to 1985, the latest year for which such detailedfigures are available.   As of 1985, he calculates, almost one-third ofmetropolitan Denver's population consisted of adult boomers,and their number had grown more than 14% in the first half ofthe 1980s.   The Washington and Houston areas ranked just behind, withadult boomers constituting 31% of their 1985 population.Filling out the top 10 magnet list were the metropolitanareas of Austin, Texas; Atlanta; San Francisco; Dallas;Colorado Springs, Colo.; Portsmouth, N.H.; and Las Vegas,Nev. Adult boomers accounted for anywhere from 27% to 30% oftheir 1985 population. Of all the top 10 areas, Atlanta andDallas registered the biggest gains in boomers from 1980 to1985, almost a 20% increase in each case.   Mr. Frey notes that most magnet areas are importantservice centers with good job opportunities and attractivelife styles. He concedes that both Denver and Houston mayhave slipped in the ratings since 1985 because ofenergy-industry problems, but doubts they have dropped fromthe top 10 in percentage of boomers in their population.   The 10 top boomer losers -- with the smallest proportionof adult boomers in their total population and a boomerexodus from 1980 to 1985 of at least 5% -- were oldindustrial areas, such as Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pa.;Buffalo, N.Y.; Johnstown, Pa.; and Youngstown, Ohio. Adultboomers accounted for only 21% to 23% of the population ofthese 10 areas, and from 1980 to 1985, the number of boomersin a few districts fell as much as 15%.                                                                                                          Higher Outlays Backed   For Kids' Health Care                                                                                                          CHILD HEALTH emerges as a matter of increasing publicconcern.   A recent nationwide survey by the National Association ofChildren's Hospitals finds three in five Americans believingU.S. children today are worse off than five years ago; awhopping 29% believes kids are &quot;much worse&quot; off. Askedspecifically whether the U.S. should spend more on children'shealth care, 71% answer affirmatively while only 20% thinkthe country can't afford it. A surprising 59% say they wouldfavor a $100-a-year tax increase earmarked for better healthcare for uninsured poor children.   The poll found women more likely than men to saychildren's situation has worsened, but the two gendersequally favor spending more on children's health. Even amongself-identified conservatives, three in five support greaterspending in this field.   The association and other child advocacy groups arelaunching an &quot;I Care for Kids&quot; campaign to make child healthcare a bigger issue in coming elections.                                                                                                          Racial Gap Shrinks   On Premarital Sex                                                                                                          PREMARITAL SEX becomes ever more common, according to a1988 government survey of women 15 to 44.   Nearly three-fourths, 72.4% to be exact, indicate theybegan their sexual experience in nonmarital relations,&quot;continuing a long-term trend since at least the late 1950s,&quot;says William Pratt of the National Center for HealthStatistics. In the previous, 1982 survey, the figure was64.7%.   The recent rise has occurred mainly among white women. Ateach age, higher proportions of black women report premaritalsex experience, but this has long been true. Now, says Mr.Pratt, the black and white patterns are converging.   Sixteen percent of the 1988 respondents say they weremarried when having their first intercourse, while 12% hadn'tyet had sexual experience.   Along with the rise in premarital sex, the survey showsanother drop in age at first intercourse -- two out of fivehad begun sex before they were 18 -- and an increase in thetime between first intercourse and marriage. The almostinevitable result is a rise in the number of women who havehad multiple partners and in the number of partners each hashad.   Another survey, however, offers a different perspective.Writing in Society magazine, Tom Smith and colleagues fromthe University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Centerreport that the vast majority of Americans are monogamous, inthe sense of having had only one sexual partner, married orunmarried, during the preceding year. Only 18% of allsexually active adults in a large 1988 sampling weren'tmonogamous under this definition. Even among unmarried menunder 30, almost half specified only one sex partner duringthe previous 12 months.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          OVER HALF of black children under 18 and nearly one-thirdof Hispanic children live with only one parent, the CensusBureau reports. This compares with 19% of white children. . .. High school seniors who don't intend to go to college aretwice as likely to become smokers as those planning to go,say Ingrid Waldron of the University of Pennsylvania andDiane Lye of the University of Washington. They suggest thatfor the non-college-bound, smoking may compensate for lack ofsatisfaction in school status.</TEXT></DOC>
