Cause of the ignitionwas not determined, but the probable source was an oil furnace in thebasement of the small dwelling about 30 feet south of the tank that firstfailed. Investigators theorize that sleet that had frozen around thetank vents in the 20{sup 0}F weather prevents the vent on No. 3 fromoperating during the pumping. The sudden increase of heat when the largegasoline spill ignited caused Tanks 2 and 4 to rupture when pressurebuilt up faster than the vents could release it.</TEXT></DOC>
