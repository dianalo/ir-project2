 He was with a technician doing a software update on the voicemail system.andM;He noticed a lot of calls coming in - which was strange because it was afterworking hours on a Friday.andP;  He was there with no one else in the building.andO;The calls were coming in one right after another.andP;  When he answered the phonethe callers hung up.andM;He Plugged a phone in and heard a conversation in Spanish.andP;  He tested all 10incoming trunk lines.andP;  Two of them had conversations, in Spanish.andM;His first instinct was to disconnect the calls.andP;  But the callers called rightback.andP;  As he continued to listen he heard the callers touchtoning numbersafter they reached the voice mail system.andP;  He used a tape recorder to recordthe touchtones and disconnected the calls, but the calls kept coming.andM;He changed his tactics.andP;  Disconnecting the calls wasn't working.andP;  He wouldgather evidence and have the phone company trace the calls.andP;  He attached aprinter to the phone system to collect call detail information and left forthe evening.andM;When he came in on Saturday morning he found a call detail record showingdozens of international calls made on the phone system overnight.andP;  Forty ofthe calls were to the same area code - the 809 area code that serves theCaribbean.andP;  Other calls were to Ecuador, Mexico and Haiti.andP;  Some of the callswere over an hour.andM;Figuring he had enough evidence, the telecom manager reprogrammed the voicemail system so it wouldn't answer incoming calls.andP;  Then he got on the phoneto his long distance vendors, ATandamp;T, Sprint and a local long distance company.andO;Because it was a Saturday none of the long distance companies could doanything about tracing calls.andP;  But Sprint was able to give him a record of800 number calls right away.andP;  It turns out most of the calls came from NewYork City, especially the Bronx, and Pennsylvania.andP;  Sprint referred thetelecom manager to their security division.andM;The telecom manager, who doesn't want his name used, figures he was lucky.andO;&quot;We caught them real early,&quot; he says, &quot;we only lost $1,000 to $1,500.&quot;andM;A little sleuthing revealed the calls were made by people who called thecompany on its 800 lines, used the &quot;transfer to extension&quot; feature of thecompany's voice mail system and dialed 9 to get an outside line.andP;  The callswent through even though the company's long distance lines are restrictedbecause it was the voice mail system that was putting the calls through, nota telephone extension.andM;The telecom manager says there was no way for him to know this feature couldwork this way.andP;  The manufacturer was not sympathetic.andP;  They told him he isresponsible for learning how to use his system.andM;, I think they should give me the equipment already protected,&quot; says themanager.andP;  &quot;I shouldn't have to fix it after I get it.&quot;andM;The system was patched by blocking the number 9 as an entry after the&quot;transfer to&quot; feature is accessed.andP;  The telecom manager reports it was asimple thing to doandM;two minutes of a tech's time.andM;The fraudulent callers are persistent.andP;  They continue to call in on the 800number.andP;  Thirty or 40 calls were made right after the &quot;transfer to&quot; featurewas disabled.andP;  The company blocked 800 calls coming from the areas that aregenerating most of the abuse as a temporary measure.andP;  Legitimate customers inthose areas were alerted to the change.andM;&quot;It looks as though we will have to Pay the full bill for this,&quot; the telecommanager sighs.andP;  &quot;The long distance companies say it is a theft against mycompany.andP;  Yet they will have no incentive to go after these people if I pay -and they have all the records.&quot;andM;The telecom manager would like to prosecute the callers, but he has littlechance of success.andP;  Most of the fraudulent calls came from payphones in theBronx.andM;Even if he could pin down a few of the callers, chances are the cost ofprosecution would be much higher than any restitution he would receive.andP;  RamiAbuhamdeh of the Communications Fraud Control Association says if you'relucky the court may order the fraudulent caller to pay $50 a month or so foras long as he or she is on probation.andP;  It's usually not enough to even startpaying back the amount of the fraud.andP;  &quot;I don't know a lot about successstories for end users,&quot; he says.andM;Brian Bales, manager of CPE Security in Sprint's Corporate Security Groupsays your best bet for prosecution is through a task force put together by afederal law enforcement agency such as the US Secret Service.andM;A recent Secret Service investigation, called Operation Sundevil, resulted inthe seizure of computers and equipment responsible for about $50 million intelephone losses.andM;Even so, the chance of putting together a successful case are slim.andP;  ThePhiladelphia Inquirer lost about $100,000 to telephone fraud, but decided notto prosecute.andM;&quot;Forget catching the people who did it,&quot; says Linda Paris, the Inquirer'stelecom manager.andP;  &quot;We tried calling some of the apartments the calls camefrom.andP;  We found in most cases what sounded like sincere lack of knowledge ofwhat was going on.&quot; Paris suspects the fraudulent callers were using thedemarcation points in apartment buildings to place their calls.andM;What can you do to protect your phone system against fraud? The telecommanager at the western manufacturer removed the little-used DISA only to bedone in by a voice mail feature he had no idea existed.andP;  Linda Paris had theInquirer's system sewn up tight, but when the PBX software was upgraded thesafeguards were not replaced.andM;The only conclusion we can draw from these true stories is you can never betoo careful when protecting your phone system against fraud.andP;  We ran a bigarticle article on fraud in our May, 1990 issue.andP;  And we continue to run tipsand warnings in Dollar Savings Tips and News andamp; Scouting.andM;What You Can Do * Toll restrict all international calls.andP;  * Monitor yourcalls.andP;  Examine SMDR data promptly.andP;  * Turn DISA off at night.andP;  Better, don'tuse it at all.andP;  * Turn off your remote access port and use a return-dialingmodem.andP;  * Limit the number of access-code attempts, If the wrong code isentered once, kill the call or transfer it to an operator.andP;  * Be aware of&quot;dumpster divers&quot; who rifle your trash for access codes.andP;  Watch out forcleaners who steal codes off Rolodexes.andP;  * Use telephone company callingcards instead of DISA.andP;  * Check - Check!andP;  out unexplained increases ininbound 800 calls.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
