The commission recently granted the electric utility a $464 million rate rise, sharply lower than the company's $735 million request to help pay for its Plant Vogtle nuclear power plant. The commission's decision reflected the effect of excluding $951 million in &quot;imprudent and excessive&quot; costs associated with the construction of Vogtle Unit 1 from the rate base.    The $430 million charge would be the net effect of the disallowance, Southern said. The figure includes a $226 million after-tax charge that the company already said it would write off no later than January 1988. Southern said it would write off the $226 million after the total budget for the plant exceeded a self-imposed cap of $8.35 billion to reach $8.87 billion. Georgia Power, which owns 45.7% of the plant, had pledged not to pass on to ratepayers any more than $3.56 billion of its share of the plant's cost.    A Southern spokesman said the timing of any remaining charge will depend on the appeals process. Georgia Power has asked the commission to reconsider its ruling, but hasn't decided whether it will appeal the decision to a Georgia state court if the commission doesn't reconsider, the spokesman said.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Southern closed at $23.125, down 50 cents, in a broadly lower market.    (Revised WSJ Oct. 16, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
