John Wakeham, the U.K. secretary of state for energy,announced in Houston that approvals had been given fordevelopment to begin on two major North Sea projects that hevalued at #2.4 billion. Also, he said he expects 1991activity in the U.K. sector of the North Sea to surpass eventhe 1990 level, the previous record year.</LP><TEXT>   The projects given the green light by Mr. Wakeham and theU.K. Department of Energy are the Alba oil field, to bedeveloped by a consortium led by Chevron Corp., and the AmocoCorp.-operated Everest and Lomond fields. Everest and Lomondwill supply natural gas to a new pipeline system to be builtby the Amoco-led group.   Mr. Wakeham and Finn Kristensen, Norway's energy minister,were in Houston to speak at the annual Offshore TechnologyConference. Mr. Kristensen said he expects fast growth in theNorwegian offshore activity to result in $4.5 billion ininvestments this year. &quot;According to our latest estimates,the market will be in excess of $6 billion in the next fewyears,&quot; he added, noting that the Norwegian continental shelfnow represents the world's third largest offshore market,surpassed only by the U.S. and U.K.   At a news conference, Mr. Wakeham announced the new U.K.sector projects. With these, he said, 11 new developmentsestimated to cost a total of #3 billion, or more than $5billion, have been approved so far this year. That compareswith 18 projects valued at #4.8 billion, or some $8.2billion, approved in all of 1990.   The latest projects, Mr. Wakeham said, &quot;are a positiveindicator of the continuing potential&quot; of the U.K.continental shelf. In an interview, he also attributed therise in interest in the U.K. North Sea to &quot;a fair andbasically stable fiscal and licensing regime&quot; for the oilcompanies operating there.   The Alba field, some 140 miles northeast of Aberdeen,Scotland, holds the heaviest crude oil yet to be recovered inthe North Sea -- around 20 degrees gravity in the measurementused by the industry. Also, Mr. Wakeham noted, it's the firstof its type of North Sea field where the oil lies in a longshallow reservoir.   &quot;The latest technological advances in horizontal drillingwill be used&quot; to increase recovery from the reservoir whileusing fewer wells, said James E. McCormick, president andchief operating officer of Oryx Energy Co., which holds a15.5% working interest in the field. Horizontal drilling isan old technique that is now being widely used byDallas-based Oryx and others in developing certain oilfields. The borehole is drilled straight at the start, but itthen makes up to a 90-degree turn to run parallel to thesurface to cross more vertical oil-bearing sections.   Separately, a Netherlands unit of Unocal Corp., a memberof the Alba consortium, reported yesterday that the drillingof five horizontal wells sharply increased the flow of oilfrom its Helder field in the North Sea. It said productionjumped to 10,900 barrels a day from 4,200 as a result of theredevelopment program.   In London, Chevron UK, operator and holder of a 33.17%share of the Alba, reported the field has more than onebillion barrels of oil in place, with as many as 400 millionbarrels estimated to be recoverable. &quot;I believe that this isone of the largest oil fields that remains to be developed onthe U.K. continental shelf,&quot; said Charles Smith, Chevron'smanaging director.   In addition to Chevron, eight other oil companies areparticipants, including two units of Conoco Inc., severalother U.S. companies and Belgium's Petrofina S.A. Plans callfor development to be in two phases, with first-phaseproduction beginning in January 1994 and peaking at 60,000 to70,000 barrels a day.   Plans for the Everest and Lomond fields also includedevelopment of a gasgathering system for the central NorthSea. Amoco, the operator, estimated the cost of the projectat $1.7 billion.   The 255-mile-long pipeline will run from the Everest fieldto the U.K. mainland at Teesside. Gas from the Everest andLomond fields will be transported through the pipeline at arate of about 300 million cubic feet a day. The pipeline,however, will have a total capacity of about 1.4 billioncubic feet a day, allowing it to act as a gas-transportationsystem for gas fields yet to be developed in the centralNorth Sea, Amoco said.</TEXT></DOC>
