Tonight, Queen Elizabeth joins him for a party at MemorialStadium, the home of his baseball team, the BaltimoreOrioles. President Bush, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney anda host of other luminaries in business and government arescheduled to partake in his feast of ballpark franks,Maryland crabcakes and beef tenderloin.</LP><TEXT>   Yet just as Mr. Jacobs is ascending the pinnacle of socialand political life, two of his largest business ventures areheading the other direction. Like other highfliers in theleveraged buy-out binge of the 1980s, the New York-basedfinancier is encountering big problems in the tight-credit1990s. Two of his largest holdings, Memorex Telex N.V., theDutch computer company, and Triangle Pacific Corp., a makerof cabinets and flooring, are in trouble with theircreditors. Triangle has defaulted on $170 million of bank andjunk-bond debt, while Memorex said last week it expects todefault on loan agreements affecting about $250 million indebt.   While his ownership of the Orioles has thrust him into alimelight he says he prefers to avoid, Mr. Jacobs clearlyenjoys the schmoozing that goes along with owning a majorleague team. On the opening day of the 1991 season, Mr.Jacobs had Vice President Dan Quayle toss out the firstpitch. With the Gulf war freshly won, he also astutely hadDefense Secretary Cheney publicly introduced -- to athunderous ovation from the crowd. The night before, Mr.Jacobs feted Mr. Cheney and other Washington insiders at thehome of George Will, the political columnist and best-sellingauthor of books on baseball.   Mr. Jacobs's mission, claims James Cannon, a politicalacquaintance, is to get &quot;the important people of the countryand the world to know who he is.&quot; Says John McMullen, ownerof the Houston Astros: &quot;Nobody ever knew who he was until hebought a baseball team. He'd never have the queen withoutit.&quot; (This evening's stop on the queen's U.S. trip wasarranged by the State Department.)   Mr. Jacobs has studded the boards of Memorex and theOrioles with his political friends, including former SenateMajority Leader Howard Baker, former Cabinet members such asRobert Strauss and William Brock, and civil rights leaderVernon Jordan. Also on the Orioles board is the wife ofOklahoma Sen. David Boren, who, in 1988, appointed Mr. Jacobsto a Senate intelligence oversight committee. Mr. Jacobs isalso in the real-estate business with the family of CommerceSecretary Robert Mosbacher, another favorite baseball guest.   Mr. Cheney plays a doubly important role in Mr. Jacobs'slife. He reappointed the financier to the Defense AdvisoryBoard, a group of defense industry executives and others whoadvise the secretary on defense matters. And Memorex, whichMr. Jacobs acquired in 1986, has had critical businesspending before the Pentagon, notably bids for contracts toprovide advanced data-processing equipment.   In 1988, Memorex and five other computer vendorscomplained that the Navy's procurement system was biased infavor of International Business Machines Corp., an allegationthat congressional investigators confirmed. Memorex, whichhas 5% of the Navy's computer contracts, now is hopeful ofwinning more. A spokesman for Mr. Cheney says Mr. Jacobs hasnever discussed business matters with him.   For his part, Mr. Jacobs says he strictlycompartmentalizes his involvement in business, politics andsports. &quot;I have one ironclad rule,&quot; he says. &quot;I will nevertalk to any government official about any of my businesses.&quot;   At 53 years of age, the bespectacled, six-foot-threeinvestor is a man of many paradoxes. He is coolly unemotionalas he watches his own baseball team play, but he once stalkedout of New York's swank 21 Club when his hamburger twicearrived too well done for his medium-rare taste.   He claims to be media-shy but has befriended manyjournalists, including Katharine Graham, chairman ofWashington Post Co.; New York Times columnist Leslie Gelb;Los Angeles Times publisher David Laventhol; Wall StreetJournal managing editor Norman Pearlstine, and RobertBartley, the Journal's editor. Once, at a cocktail party, hecomplained about Orioles coverage to the publisher of theBaltimore Sun, whose parent, Times-Mirror Co., he serves as adirector.   &quot;I don't know an owner in baseball who's happy with thecoverage on the sports page of the local paper,&quot; Mr. Jacobssays.   In the late 1970s, his fund-raising prowess caught the eyeof William Brock, then the Republican Party chairman. Mr.Jacobs has not been among the heaviest donors to the GOP, buthe has pumped a healthy $155,000 into mostly Republicancampaigns since 1980. He says he would rather be known as acontributor of ideas than money.   Although almost all of his holdings that file publicreports are debt-ridden money losers, Mr. Jacobs says lastyear was his best ever in business, thanks to the success ofhis many closely held enterprises. His net worth last yearexceeded $500 million, according to sources close to Mr.Jacobs. But Morgan Guaranty Trust, one of Mr. Jacobs'sleading lenders, is so unhappy with the investor that it isconsidering not offering further corporate loan assistance inthe near future, according to individuals at the firm. AMorgan Guaranty spokesman declines to comment on Mr. Jacobs.Meanwhile, the bond market isn't displaying much moreconfidence. As of yesterday, Memorex bonds traded at between25 cents and 55 cents on the dollar.   The son of a Newton, Mass., real-estate investor, Mr.Jacobs graduated from Yale and its law school and got hisstart in 1968 in investment banking and later became aventure capitalist, investing in Texas oil just as petroleumprices began to soar in the early 1970s.   Then he jumped into the leveraged buy-out game. In 1984,he formed an LBO partnership with Peter G. Peterson, theinvestment banker and former Commerce secretary, thoughwithin two years it split apart over a variety of issues. Mr.Jacobs then formed his own company, E.S. Jacobs andamp; Co., wherehe hit on a powerful success formula: investing little equitywhile withdrawing significant fees.   In the $550 million LBO of Memorex in 1986, his equityinvestment totaled only $1.2 million. A year later, heacquired Telex for $900 million, putting in only $11 millionin equity and paying the rest with borrowed money. Then hemerged the two. As of December 1990, the merged company had$1.2 billion of long-term debt and negative shareholders'equity of $129.6 million.   But Mr. Jacobs nevertheless made money on the investmentimmediately, taking out $13.9 million in fees from Memorexand Telex in connection with the buy-outs, according topublic filings by the companies. Although the fees exceededhis equity investment, Mr. Jacobs says &quot;the fees we've takenare at the low end&quot; of what most investment advisers charge.In addition, a consulting arrangement with Memorex calls forthat company to pay him $700,000 annually.   But now, with a recession in full swing and loans hard tocome by, the combined company is struggling and badly needscash. Worse, demand is slipping for the kind of products itmakes: peripherals for IBM-compatible computers. In March,Memorex invited its 4,000 mid-level and senior managers tobuy several million dollars of new convertible bonds. Theplan was scrapped last month when lawyers advised Memorexthat it wasn't in the best interests of employees.   Mr. Jacobs had hoped to raise additional equity forMemorex abroad. Bondholders say they were told last week bySmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., which Mr. Jacobs hasretained to restructure Memorex, that year-long attempts toraise added equity abroad had so far failed.   Mr. Jacobs says he is considering putting more money intothe company. &quot;There is nothing wrong with the company thatmore equity on the balance sheet won't cure,&quot; he says. Mr.Strauss, the former Democratic Party chairman, who serves ona Memorex advisory board, says, &quot;Eli is creative, and I thinkhe'll make it.&quot;   The problems at Triangle Pacific, the cabinet and flooringcompany, stem from weakness in the housing market. &quot;No oneever thought there would be a 40% decline in housing startssince 1988,&quot; he says. Recently, Triangle defaulted oninterest payments on its $170 million of junk-bond debt, andon its bank debt. Although bankruptcy proceedings remain apossibility, Mr. Jacobs says, &quot;We fully expect this will berestructured outside of court.&quot; Smith Barney has also beenretained to restructure Triangle.   As in many other investments, Mr. Jacobs personally putlittle into Triangle. When he and partners acquired it for$200 million in a 1988 buy-out, their equity investmenttotaled only $8 million. He has already recovered part of hisinvestment by charging $4.3 million in advisory fees. Becauseof Triangle's troubles, Mr. Jacobs says he cut his $650,000annual consulting fee from the company by half in 1990.Moreover, his bankers forced him to put $10 million intoTriangle last year.   Another venture, Flagship Express Inc., anaviation-services company, paid Mr. Jacobs $1 million inadvisory fees and an annual consulting arrangement of$750,000 after he had obtained $52.8 million in financing fora 1989 purchase of the company. &quot;In relation to what we did{the fees} were fair and reasonable&quot;; the transaction wascomplex and took up much of his time, he says.   Other public ventures Mr. Jacobs has been involved withhave also run into problems. Mr. Jacobs sold his shares inJos A. Bank Clothiers in late 1988, losing $975,000 on thesale by his own count. A biotechnology firm in which he wasthe largest stockholder, Bio-Response Inc., never really gotoff the ground. In late 1989, the company filed forbankruptcy and liquidated, leaving nothing for shareholders.   Despite all the troubles at some of his most visiblecompanies, Mr. Jacobs says his overall track record isexcellent. By his count he has invested in more than 100companies in the last 20 years, and problem companies, hesays, &quot;have been a very small part of my portfolio.&quot; Hecharacterizes Memorex and Triangle as &quot;irritants&quot; that are&quot;disproportionate to the value of my investments.&quot;   &quot;Last year was the best year I ever had in business,&quot; hesays, although he declines to offer examples of successes.Some 90% of his companies, he says, are privately held anddon't report operating results. &quot;I intend to keep it thatway,&quot; Mr. Jacobs says. The companies range from a maker oftoys to a biotech firm and a cable television business, andthe people who run them say Mr. Jacobs generally has ahands-off management style unless an operation gets intoserious trouble, at which point he steps in.   Conspicuously intellectual, Mr. Jacobs peppers hisconversations with references to books on urban planning. (Heand architect I.M. Pei are friends.) While at Yale, Mr.Jacobs, who is divorced, was managing editor of the YaleDaily News. After two years in the Army, he went to Yale LawSchool, although he has never practiced law.   During a recent interview, he compared the new ballpark heis building for the Orioles to other &quot;stadia,&quot; promising thathis facility will combine the best in technology with thehomey atmosphere of Boston's Fenway Park, where Mr. Jacobswatched games in his youth.   How deep is his commitment to the Orioles? When Mr. Jacobsand his investor group bought the team from the widow of thelate Edward Bennett Williams in 1988, Mr. Jacobs sank verylittle of his own money into the $70 million deal, accordingto a member of the group.   On the horizon looms a new threat to Mr. Jacobs' regionalmonopoly on major league baseball. Nearby Washington, whichprovides about 25% of the fans at Orioles games, has beenwithout baseball since the Senators played their last game in1971. But lately, there has been talk of the city getting anexpansion club.   That could cost Mr. Jacobs not only some paying fans, but,significantly, many of his government guests as well.Promoters of a Washington franchise say Mr. Jacobs has beenlobbying other team owners against voting to permit theexpansion -- a claim supported by sources close to the leagueexpansion committee. Mr. Jacobs contends that he is &quot;strictlyneutral&quot; on the issue, and would even give a thumbs up forthe project if he were forced to cast the tie-breaking vote.   In the meantime, Washington's big wheels have no choicebut the Orioles in Baltimore. From the owners box, they cantake in an evening of baseball and, as it happens, view thebacklit Memorex Telex billboard hanging in the stadium.&quot;Nobody feels they are being had or taken if you invite themto a baseball game,&quot; says the humorist Art Buchwald, one ofMr. Jacobs's guests on opening day. &quot;It's more interestingthen inviting someone to visit your textile factory.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
