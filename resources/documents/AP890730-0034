The report of railroad workers' discontent over wages and workconditions came after hundreds of thousands of coal miners in theUkraine and Siberia walked off their jobs earlier this month overpoor living and working conditions.   Railroad director A. Zaitsev spoke of the strike calls in abriefing for Soviet journalists, Pravda said. The report did notsay when the strike might occur.   Pravda said a railroad strike would be an ``extraordinarilydangerous action, leading to a very real catastrophe for thenorthwest economic region.''   Another walkout following the coal miners' strike would add tothe economic chaos and could make strikes more attractive to otherdisgruntled Soviet workers.   The Pravda article said transportation strikes were prohibitedin many countries, intimating that officials would not tolerate awalkout.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sided with the striking coalminers against bureaucrats who he said were holding back reforms,and he promised broad improvements in their lives. Most returned towork.   In a speech July 19 on the coal miners' strike, Gorbachev saidthere had been calls for a railroad engineers' strike beginningAug. 1 and warned against it. Such a strike would damage efforts toreform the economy and improve conditions for everyone, Gorbachevsaid.   Pravda, quoting the Moscow-Leningrad railroad's newspaper, saida strike would shut down factories in the northeast Soviet Unionand cause ``chaos in our everyday lives.''   It said railroad workers complained they were not given adequatetime to eat during their shifts. It said they claimed unjust wagediscrepancies among workers at stations along the 375-mile route.   Pravda questioned why ``independent activists'' were makingdemands rather than the unions that represent the railroad workers.   Soviet unions long have done little but follow official policy,and workers have begun voicing their demands outside the officialunion structure.</TEXT></DOC>
