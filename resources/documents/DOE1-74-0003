The paper details the installation of low-flowwells across the plume to block flow of contaminants. This interdictionresulted in a serendipitous activation of the naturally occurring soilmicrobes in the sediments down-gradient from the well field. The netresult of the interdiction and microbiological activation was to effecta rapid and dramatic reduction in the hydrocarbon contaminants in theplume down-gradient from the interdiction well field.</TEXT></DOC>
