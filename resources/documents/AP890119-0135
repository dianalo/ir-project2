SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan leaves an America that'solder, eats less red meat, gives birth to fewer babies, is lesslikely to divorce and has 16,741,546 more residents than when hetook over the White House eight years ago.   The Census Bureau estimated the population at 246,879,546 as ofJan. 1 of this year. When Reagan took office in 1981, it stood at230,138,000.   That means an increase of 16,741,546 people in eight years. Or apopulation growth of 5,749 people-a-day under the Reaganadministration.   Just as well, because the extra wage earners will be needed tohelp pay a national debt which grew sharply over the period, risingfrom $994 billion in 1981 to an anticipated $2.87 trillion by theend of this year.   Reagan's California is still the most populous state, of course,and getting more entrenched every day. New York and Texas remainsecond and third.   But Florida, which ranked seventh in 1980, was up to fourth placeby 1987, having passed Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio on the way.   Many of those new Floridians are retirees. Americans are older, abit, on average.   In 1980, the median age of all Americans was 30 years. That meanshalf were 30 or older and half under 30.   By 1987 the nation's median age had risen to 32.1, despite allthe new babies contributing to the overall population growth.   Longer lives are a chief reason for the rising median age.   When the oldest president took office, national life expectancywas 74.2 years and 4.4 percent of the people were aged 75 and over.   By 1987, life expectancy was up to 74.9 and nearly 5 percent werein the 75-and-older age group. The nation's death rate fell from 8.8per 1,000 people in 1980 to 8.7 in 1987.   At the other end of the lifespan, infant mortality has declinedsharply, from 12.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 10in 1987.   Perhaps helping in this was the increase in physicians duringthis period. In 1980 there were 211 doctors for every 100,000Americans, while by 1985 that had climbed to 237 per 100,000.   The nation's birth rate has dropped during the Reagan years.   The National Center for Health Statistics reported that 15.9babies were born in 1980 for every 1,000 Americans. By 1987 that wasdown to 15.7.   The number of orphans has also dropped, from 52,000 children whohad lost both parents in 1980 to 30,000 in 1986.   Marriage seems to have grown somewhat less attractive during theeight-year Reagan span. In 1980 there were 10.6 marriages for every1,000 people. By 1987 that rate had fallen to 9.9 per 1,000.   The number of unmarried couples living together rose 63 percentto 2.6 million from 1980 to 1988.   At the same time, divorce has become less common, with the ratedropping from 5.2 per 1,000 in 1980 to 4.8 in 1987.   Overall, though, the majority of households still consist offamilies that include a married couple _ though the share slippedfrom 60.8 percent to 56.9 percent from 1980 to 1988.   The divorce rate has fallen _ even though the number of lawyersin the country grew from 542,205 in 1980 to 655,191 in 1985.   Crime offered fewer job opportunities for lawyers, too. Thereported crime rate fell from 5,950 per 100,000 people in 1980 to5,480 in 1986. But the populations of the federal and state stateprisons climbed from 315,974 in 1980 to 523,922 in 1986.   On a more individual front, Americans have made some changes intheir personal habits in recent years.   In 1980 U.S. residents ate an average of 157.2 pounds of redmeat. By 1986 than had fallen to 150.5 pounds.   At the same time fish consumption climbed from 12.8 pounds to14.7 pounds.   Americans eat a lot more chicken, 59.1 pounds, up from 50.1pounds in 1980. Grain consumption jumped from 116.9 pounds to 129.6pounds while the average for fresh vegetables went from 72.6 poundsto 79.4 pounds and fresh fruit rose from 86.7 pounds to 91.4 poundsper person per year.   Alcohol imbibing fell during the 1980 to 1986 period, from 29.3gallons to 27.6 gallons per capita, even though total consumption ofbeverages rose from 135.7 gallons to 140.3 gallons.   Soft drinks gained, from 37.8 gallons to 45.6 gallons over theperiod, while juices increased from 6.3 gallons to 7.3 gallons.There were modest declines reported in consumption of milk, coffeeand tea.   At another level, the United States grew during the Reagan years_ or at least came to assert an economic interest over millions moresquare miles than it did before Reagan.   On March 10, 1983, Reagan proclaimed an Exclusive Economic Zone,extending U.S. interests to the area 200 miles off the coasts. TheEEZ is not a claim to jurisdiction over territorial waters, but itamounts to an assertion of U.S. mineral and fishing rights withinthe entire zone. However, foreign ships and aircraft can still passfreely through the economic zone.   The EEZ totals 4.4 million square miles, larger than the nation's3.6 million square miles.</TEXT></DOC>
