The securities industry is in the limelight -- as are the aides of numerous high-ranking politicians -- because of a pair of scandals that have focused attention on the ease and nonchalance with which privileged information is often used by investors in Japan.    An exchange spokesman said a decision hasn't been made about whether to issue the letter or what it should say.    Aides of leading politicians of the Liberal Democratic Party, including aides to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and ranking members of his cabinet, have admitted to purchasing shares of Recruit Cosmos Co. before the company registered its shares to begin trading publicly over the counter.    Although there haven't been any accusations of insider trading in the case, questions have been raised over the way in which the shares were distributed to influential members of the financial community and to aides to powerful politicians in time for them to reap huge profits when the shares were registered and surged in value.    And this week investigations were launched into the surge in the price of Sankyo Seiki Mfg. Co. shares in unusually heavy trading ahead of the announcement of a tie-in with Nippon Steel Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
