CohenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AEGTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)AIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Coniston Partners, the investment firm seeking control of Allegis Corp., said it intends to begin soliciting shareholder consent today to remove the Allegis board.    Coniston, which owns 13% of Allegis common stock, said it delivered to Chicago-based Allegis a new consent plan that calls for the removal of all of Allegis's 16 directors and the election of a new slate of 10 directors. The group had previously called for the removal of 13 of the directors, and the election of six new nominees. Coniston said the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared its consent solicitation plan yesterday.    When the investor group first unveiled its plan to solicit shareholder consent late last month, Coniston said that if it were successful in its battle, it would retain the three incumbent Allegis directors who are non-management directors of the travel company's executive committee.    But Keith Gollust, a principal of Coniston, said yesterday that the group had changed its plan after hearing public statements by the three directors who said they stood behind the present Allegis management and board in objecting to Coniston's plans.    Coniston also said that if it succeeds in its fight to remove the Allegis board, it plans to proceed with the $60-a-share distribution to stockholders that the Allegis board approved last month. That recapitalization plan, which called for Allegis to borrow most of the $3 billion cost of the distribution, was intended by the board as a measure to ward off Coniston's takeover threats.    A spokesman for Allegis declined to comment on Coniston's latest announcement.    Coniston has said that if it succeeds in its battle, it would break up Allegis into its three principal businesses and sell or spin off those units. Allegis owns United Airlines, Hertz Corp. and a chain of Westin and Hilton International hotels.    To win a consent solicitation, Coniston needs to deliver consents representing a majority of the company's shares outstanding. It set yesterday as the record date for the consent. The previous record date was May 26. As of March 2, Allegis had 50.2 million shares outstanding.    Coniston said it seeks to nominate to the Allegis board Mr. Gollust, Paul Tierney and Augustus Oliver, the investment firm's three principals. Coniston also seeks to nominate David C. Miller Jr., president and chief executive officer of American Investors Inc.; Eben W. Pyne, a director of and consultant to W.R. Grace and Co.; David H. Strassler, former chairman of UA Columbia Cablevision; William C. Greenough, retired chairman of Teachers Insurance andamp; Annuity Association and College Retirement Equities Fund; Alan R. Gruber, chairman of Orion Capital Corp.; James J. Kerley, retired vice chairman of Emerson Electric Co.; and Fred R. Sullivan, chairman of Kidde Inc.    Allegis shares closed yesterday at $89.50, off 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
