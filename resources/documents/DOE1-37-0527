A method of sample preparationprocedure and AAS measurement is presented which allows the direct detectionof metals such as cadmium, lead, arsenic and mercury. The method wastested with standard reference materials and checked in Round Robin tests.More than 150 paper samples which are used in food packaging were analysedwith regard to their heavy metal content. In case of heavy metal traces,the values were compared with literature data. In order to evaluate theinfluence of heavy metals in packaging materials it is necessary to determinethe soluble part of the total amount of these metals in the packagingmaterial, which also can be done by means of our method. A comparisonof metal contents of selected foodstuffs with paper samples analysedby us showed that the consumer will not suffer an additional burdeningby migration of heavy metals from packaging materials into foodstuffs.</TEXT></DOC>
