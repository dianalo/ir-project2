In its announcement Wednesday, IBM said it is continuing todiscuss a similar licensing arrangement with U.S. Memories Inc.,the consortium launched in June to rebuild the American share ofthe world memory chip market.   IBM was the world's first company to announce volume productionof the 4 million-bit dynamic random access memory chip, known asthe 4-megabit DRAM.   The deal helps Micron, a Boise, Idaho-based company that mightnot have been able to come up with the design and processtechnology for the new generation of chips by itself.   It also benefits computer users by ensuring that there will beanother American supplier of the chips. IBM is the world's largestmaker of chips but uses its entire production internally. It alsobuys chips from outside suppliers, including Micron.   ``This agreement shows IBM's dedication to preserving Americansupplies of vital semiconductor components,'' Joe Parkinson,Micron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.   The only U.S. companies besides Micron that sell DRAMs on theopen market are Texas Instruments Inc., which has aresearch-sharing agreement in DRAMs with Japan's Hitachi Ltd., andMotorola Inc., which is closely allied in DRAMs with Japan'sToshiba Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
