Greenspan warned of growing signs of price pressures stemmingfrom such factors as the severe drought, tight labor markets andhigh industry operating rates.   ``The costs to our economy and society of allowing a moreintense inflationary process to become entrenched are serious,''Greenspan said in testimony today before the Senate BankingCommittee.   ``As the experience of the last two decades has clearly shown,accelerating wages and prices would have to be countered later byquite restrictive policies, with unavoidably adverse implicationsfor production and employment,'' Greenspan said.   That comment was an obvious reference to the severe 1981-82recession brought on by Greenspan's predecessor, former FedChairman Paul Volcker, as a way to fight the double-digit inflationthat plagued the country at the beginning of the decade.   Greenspan gave no indication that the central bank was planninganything close to the tight-money policies pursued by Volcker. ButGreenspan said that the Fed did intend to err on the side oftighter credit conditions rather than worrying that Fed policycould be too restrictive and thus harm long-run growth prospects.   ``The long-run costs of a return to higher inflation and therisks of this occurring under current circumstances aresufficiently great that Federal Reserve policy at this juncturemight be well advised to err more on the side of restrictivenessrather than stimulus,'' he said.   Greenspan's comments came in his mid-year report to Congress onthe central bank's conduct of monetary policy and its economicoutlook.   The remarks were not considered a surprise. Financial marketshave been expecting another slight tightening of credit conditionsin coming weeks because of continuing evidence that the U.S.economy is growing rapidly. The latest such information cameFriday, when the government reported that the jobless rate fell toa 14-year-low of 5.3 percent in June.   The tightening process has pushed a variety of interest rates,including mortgage rates, higher in recent months. Banks raisedtheir prime lending rate, which serves as a benchmark for manyconsumer loans, to 9 percent in May and many economists areexpecting another one-half percentage point increase in the primerate.   Immediately following the Oct. 19 collapse of the stock market,the Fed began an aggressive credit-easing process to insure thatthe market turmoil would not topple the country into a recession.   When Greenspan last appeared before Congress in February todiscuss monetary policy, he said that the central bank was stilleasing credit conditions. He said then that he believed the dangersof a recession or higher inflation were about equal.   But in today's report, Greenspan put the emphasis on fightinginflation. He confirmed that the Fed had taken a ``succession ofrestraining steps from late March through late June.'' Those moveshave pushed short-term interest rates up by one full percentagepoint. Greenspan said the moves were taken because the Fed was``well aware that it should not fall behind'' in resistinginflationary pressures.   In the mid-year report, Greenspan said the Fed was boostingslightly its forecast for economic growth this year, saying it waslooking for the gross national product to expand at an annual rateof between 2.75 percent to 3 percent. In February, the Fed had alower GNP growth forecast of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent.   The Fed said it was leaving its targets for monetary growthunchanged for 1988 but narrowing the growth ranges in 1989. Thetarget for one measure of the money supply, known as M-2, wasshrunk to an increase of 3 percent to 7 percent, instead of thegrowth of 4 percent to 8 percent being sought in 1988.   Greenspan, sounding very much like Volcker, warned that it wasabsolutely essential that Congress make more progress in reducingthe huge federal budget deficits. He said such a cut would be thesingle most important thing government could do to reduce thecountry's huge foreign borrowing needs.   Greenspan said the deficit reduction targets established in theGramm-Rudman budget balancing law were a good start, but he urgedCongress to go even further and aim ultimately for budget surplusessometime in the 1990s.   The country is enjoying a peacetime record of 67 continuousmonths of economic growth, but some economists have expressedconcerns that if the Fed tightens credit too much, the countrycould enter a recession next year.   Most of the economic downturns the country has suffered sinceWorld War II have come from Fed actions to raise interest rates inan effort to head off inflation.   Prominent economists testifying before the Senate BankingCommittee on Tuesday disagreed over whether inflation nowrepresents a threat to the economy.   Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, said that unless Congress and the new administrationmove to get control of the huge federal budget deficits, the Fedwill have no choice but to push the country into a recession tocool an overheating economy.   ``Inflation now is becoming too high and too firmly ingrainedfor the Fed to ignore,'' Dornbusch said. ``The longer the Fed waitsin initiating a fight against inflation, the more massive therecession that needs to be created to beat inflation back down tothe comfortable levels of the mid-1980s.''   However, Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton Universtiy,said he sees no signs that inflation is threatening to heat updespite the low unemployment rate and high operating rates in manyindustries.   ``The Fed must not be swayed by the inflation hysteria thatseems to sweep Wall Street about every two weeks,'' he said. ``TheFed must ignore this insanity.''</TEXT></DOC>
