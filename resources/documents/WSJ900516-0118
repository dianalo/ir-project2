Inflation last reached 9.4 per cent in April 1982, andhas climbed to its current level from a low of 3.3 per centin January 1988. The main components in the latest rise werethe introduction of a poll tax to finance local governmentsand the increase in duties on alcohol, tobacco, andgasoline.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   This report jogged my memory. Almost a decade ago,Margaret Thatcher radically increased Britain's value-addedtax (VAT) -- in effect, a sales tax -- while cuttingincome-tax rates. Inflation, as officially measured by theconsumer price index, immediately took a huge leap upward.Government spending on inflation-indexed welfare programsalso jumped, as did the costs embedded in many privatecontracts, while the trade unions promptly demanded (andoften got) compensatory wage increases.   I remember thinking at the time that this made no economicsense whatsoever. Now, reading the latest Reuters report, Icome to the firm conclusion that it still makes no economicsense whatsoever. After all, why should an increase (ordecrease) in a sales tax or excise tax be inflationary (ordeflationary), while a comparable increase (or decrease) inthe income tax is not? Why should a poll tax be inflationarywhile the property tax, which it replaced, was not? Whyshould my office rent go up -- there is an indexation clausein the lease -- if the government should decide to increasetaxes on alcohol and cigarettes?   How is it possible for any tax increase to beinflationary? After all, what a tax does is take money fromthe private sector and transfer it to the government'streasury. Why do we think that such a money transfer can beinflationary?   The answer is that we have forgotten the basics, as taughtin Economics 101. Inflation, we learn from the prescribedelementary textbook, is a monetary phenomenon. It occurs whentoo much money is chasing too few goods. And it is certainlythe case that when too much money is chasing too few goods,we get a rising price level. But it is an error in logic toreason backward and to assert that a rising price levelalways signals inflation -- i.e., that too much money ischasing too few goods. To the degree that we ignore the causeof a rise in the price level, we will be misled intomisguided policies (such as indexation) or an erroneousmonetary policy.   Practically all our economists work from oversimplifiedmodels that assume that the price level, as measured by theconsumer price index (CPI) or producer price index (PPI),accurately mirrors the state of inflation flowing from thegovernment's monetary and fiscal policy. This assumption canlead, and has led, to dangerous absurdities.   Recall the following actual case. Back in the early 1970s,the OPEC cartel sharply raised the price of oil, thereby ineffect imposing an energy tax on the American people. Sincethe costs of energy flow through the entire economy, theprice level, as measured by the conventional indexes, rosesharply. It seemed -- and was said as well as believed --that we were experiencing inflation, as a result of whichRichard Nixon was persuaded to commit the economic folly ofimposing wage and price controls. But, of course, what wewere experiencing was not inflation at all but a case ofinstant relative impoverishment. The OPEC tax resulted in allof us having too little money to purchase the &quot;normal&quot; basketof goods represented by the CPI.   It is certainly correct to think, as classical economicsasserts, that over time people would adjust to the neweconomic reality. Having to pay more for energy meant thatthey would consume less of it, and would -- at least for awhile -- have to consume less of other things as well. Thisis precisely what happened -- over time. But the adjustmentprocess does take time, since people don't instantaneouslyrevise their living patterns and spending habits. They arelikely to react to this kind of economic &quot;shock&quot; by savingless, dipping into past savings, and borrowing more.   So for several years, &quot;inflation&quot; was with us, only itwasn't inflation at all. Nevertheless, indexation -- whethercontractual or informal -- could make that increase in theprice level permanent. Central banks, in a modern democracy,have little stomach for a painful deflation of the pricelevel.   A similar situation could easily arise from other shocks,whether &quot;acts of God&quot; or of man. The price level may well bean adequate proxy for inflation over very long periods oftime. To look at the CPI or the PPI every month, as we nowdo, and to try to draw conclusions about the value of 30-yearTreasury bonds, is ridiculous. Nevertheless, our economists-- most of them, anyhow -- are busily engaged in thisexercise, and the financial markets, having no mind of theirown on this complex issue, tend to follow suit. For thecentral bank to jiggle short-term interest rates in the lightof these monthly numbers is equally ridiculous. We arefortunate that Alan Greenspan thinks so too.   What makes the whole business even more absurd, in fact aswell as theory, is that the consumer price index is revised,and its &quot;representative&quot; basket of goods made current, onlyintermittently over the decade. It is common for years topass before the Bureau of Labor Statistics can get around tobringing us up to date on how we are distributing ourpurchasing power among available goods and services, and howmuch we are spending on the total. The price level the CPIreports always lags well behind the reality. This would notbe so important were it not for the fact that the CPI isreported in tenths of one percent, and these small variationsin an anachronistic set of monthly statistics are seized uponby commentators and analysts as possibly signifying a trend.   It would be very helpful if our economists could come upwith some way of looking at inflation, thinking aboutinflation, and roughly measuring inflation (with no attemptat false precision) that was not linked to the current levelof prices. The monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, have madea truly noble effort to decouple inflation fromcontemporaneous perturbations in the price level, but&quot;monetarism,&quot; when put into practice, has run into seriousdifficulties. In an economy with a fiat currency, wherecredit is also &quot;money,&quot; and where computers can financetransactions by accelerating the &quot;velocity&quot; of money, theconcept of the &quot;money supply&quot; is slippery and amorphous.Though still a powerful conceptual tool, it seems to be mostuseful in retrospective explanations covering long periods oftime.   Perhaps, one of these days, our monetarists -- I see themas our only hope -- will come up with a new and superiormethodology. Until then, we would be well advised to lookwith skepticism at all those statistics about prices and&quot;inflation&quot; that constitute our daily economic news. And wewould be well advised, too, to try to cure ourselves of themischievous habit of indexing wages, prices, pensions, taxes,etc. to relatively short-term changes in the price level.   ---   Mr. Kristol, an American Enterprise Institute fellow,co-edits The Public Interest and publishes The NationalInterest.</TEXT></DOC>
