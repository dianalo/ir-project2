Southmark and one of its units own 62.5% of the health-care management concern, but the two companies have been feuding for months. Indicating that it wants to distance itself from its financially troubled parent, National Heritage has proposed restructuring by spinning off its two business units to shareholders.    Such action has been opposed by Southmark, a real estate and thrift concern that is operating under federal bankruptcy-law protection. Southmark officials have said they think National Heritage would dilute current shareholders by issuing large numbers of shares to employee stock ownership plans at the spun-off companies.    The restraining order was issued despite an announcement by National Heritage that it had abandoned the employee stock ownership plan opposed by Southmark. Southmark officials said the 30-day restraining order also prohibits the National Heritage board from several other actions, including changing the company's capitalization, amending its bylaws or taking any action that would affect Southmark's interest in the company.    Southmark has said it intends to seek proxies or shareholder consents to replace National Heritage's board at a National Heritage stockholders meeting scheduled for tomorrow in Dallas. To replace the board it needs 66% shareholder approval.    &quot;The fate of the company now lies with the outside shareholders,&quot; National Heritage Chairman James R. Gilley said. </TEXT></DOC>
