Need for Data CollectionThe Housing and Community Development Act of 1970, section 501, authorizesthe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to undertake suchprograms of research, studies, testing and demonstrations relating to themission and programs of the Department as he determines to be necessaryand appropriate. Under this authorization, the Division of Policy Studieshas been assigned the responsibility of studying shelters for the homeless.On July 22, 1987 the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act was signedinto law. The amount appropriated for the McKinney programs administeredby HUD was $195 million in FY 1987. An additional $280 million was authorizedfor FY 1988, of which $73 million has been appropriated. The HUD programsinclude grants to state, county, and local governments to renovate andoperate homeless facilities; funds to public agencies and private non-profitorganizations to develop innovative approaches to providing ``transitional''housing to move capable homeless persons to independent living; funds tostates for long-term housing for handicapped homeless; and additional fundingfor rehabilitation of single room occupancy dwellings for priority useby the homeless.As these programs begin, it is important for the Department to understandthe present and potential role of the HUD McKinney Act programs with respectto how shelters for the homeless address homeless issues. Since the programshave just begun, it is not possible to obtain in-depth evaluation resultsat this time. OMB, Congress, various HUD offices, and organizations addressinghomeless issues, however, have a major interest in whatever preliminaryinformation can be obtained over the next few months. Therefore, the Divisionof Policy Studies in the Office of Policy Development and Research (PDandamp;R)will study the role of the HUD McKinney Act programs in the context ofthe ability of a community to provide appropriate shelter and servicesto the homeless.Little is known about the impact and adequacy of such policies and expenditures,the characteristics of the homeless who have been helped by them, nor theextent to which they supplement private efforts to provide shelter forthe homeless.B. Purpose of Data CollectionA telephone survey of a national sample of shelter managers and sheltervoucher program managers is proposed in order to obtain information onthe operation and funding of the shelters and voucher programs, and thecharacteristics of those who use them.Most shelters are operated by private groups, but as noted in the precedingsection, considerable Federal funds have been allocated to support theiroperation. Voucher programs rely on a combination of funding sources. Thesurvey would gather data on the cost of providing accommodation for thehomeless and the source of funds for different types of shelters (Federal,state, local government, and private).Information will be gathered on demographic characteristics, extent ofshelter use, employment, mental health and alcohol/drug abuse.In order to assess the extent to which shelters are meeting existing needs,the survey will obtain statistics on shelter capacities, occupancy andturnaway rates. Eligibility criteria and availability of additional supportservices will also be examined for shelters and voucher programs.C. Existing InformationEarly references to shelter policies, funding, and user characteristicscan be found in ``A Report to the Secretary on the Homeless and EmergencyShelters.'' \1\<NOTE/> More recent references include the Congressional Hearingthat was held in support of the McKinney Act: ``Urgent Relief for the HomelessAct'' \2\<NOTE/>; and other Congressional Hearings such as: ``Homelessnessin America'' \3\<NOTE/>; ``Homelessness in America_1988'' \4\<NOTE/>; ``The Crisis in Homelessness: Effects on Children and Families''\5\<NOTE/>; and ``Effect of Our Nation's Housing Policy on Homelessness.''\6\<NOTE/> There have been few national probability samples of sheltersthat will allow generalizations to be made about the national situation.In 1984, HUD commissioned the first national sample of shelters and thiswill be a follow-up to that study.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, <T3>A Report to the Secretary on the Homeless and Emergency Shelters, </T3>1984,Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ ``Urgent Relief for the Homeless Act'': hearing beforethe Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development of the Committeeon Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, House of Representatives, One-hundredthCongress, first session, on H.R. 558, February 4, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ ``Homelessness in America'': hearing before the Subcommitteeon Housing and Urban Affairs of the Committee on Banking, Housing, andUrban Affairs, United States Senate, One hundredth Congress, first session,January 29, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ ``Homelessness in America_1988'': hearing before the Subcommitteeon Housing and Community Development of the Committee on Banking, Finance,and Urban Affairs, House of Representatives, One-hundredth Congress, secondsession, January 26, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ ``The crisis in homelessness: effects on children andfamilies'': hearing before the Select Committee on Children, Youth, andFamilies, House of Representatives, One hundredth Congress, first session,hearing held in Washington, DC, February 24, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ ``Effect of our nation's housing policy on homelessness'':hearing before the Ad Hoc Task Force on the Homeless and Housing of theCommittee on the Budget, House of Representatives, One Hundredth Congress,first session, January 21, 1988.D. Efforts to Identify DuplicationDiscussions with HUD staff, and an extensive search of the literature bothwithin the government and in the private sector, have revealed no comparablenationwide studies or surveys of the shelter situation that have been conductedwithin the last four years.The study that is most similar to that proposed here is a national Foodand Nutrition Survey conducted for the Department of Agriculture underOMB clearance number 0584-0360. This survey focused on meals served tothe homeless in soup kitchens and to a lesser extent meals served in shelters.Only twenty cities were included in this survey. It would not be possibleto produce national estimates on the variables of interest for our proposedsurvey from the data gathered by the Department of Agriculture survey.E. Consideration of AlternativesConsideration of alternative means of collecting the required data wasgiven. For the following reasons the current plan of research was retained.andbullet; The current plan of research maximizes comparability with the1984 study, thus allowing examination of trends over time.andbullet; The proposed survey will provide national estimates of shelterprovision, while localized studies would not.andbullet; A telephone survey is an economical means of gathering nationaldata.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Description of Information Collected</ITAG>A. Universe and Sampling Methods<ITAG tagnum="81">Frame Creation</ITAG>The shelter survey will use a two-stage sample design; first selectinga sample of counties or central cities, then selecting a subsample amongthe shelters located in those jurisdictions. The frame of counties andcentral cities will come from the Census Bureau's City/County Databookfrom the 1980 Census.No complete listing of shelters throughout the country is available. Therefore,for each selected primary sampling unit (county/central city) the contractorwill review the Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan (CHAP) and any otheravailable secondary sources of information on shelters in that jurisdiction.Some phone conversations may be made to CHAP authors or other relevantgovernmental and private sector agencies (including homeless referral centers)knowledgeable about area homeless shelters. From those sources, lists ofall shelters serving the homeless, and their number of beds, will be compiledfor the eligible first-stage communities.The most applicable SIC codes for shelters for the homeless are 8399_SocialServices Not Elsewhere Classified or 9531_Housing Programs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Definition of Eligible First-Stage Communities</ITAG>All counties in the United States with a population of 25,000 or more willbe eligible for this survey. If a county contains an SMSA central citywith a population greater than 250,000, the central city will be sampledseparately to insure adequate representation in the sample. The remainingportion of a county that contains an eligible SMSA central city will itselfbe eligible for selection, if the non-central city population exceeds 25,000.<ITAG tagnum="81">Definition of Eligible Homeless Shelters</ITAG>All shelters for the homeless and voucher programs that provide shelterto the homeless are eligible for inclusion in the survey, with the exceptionof:andbullet; Shelters or programs open less than 30 days during the past 12months;andbullet; Shelters used exclusively for juvenile runaways;andbullet; Hospitals;andbullet; Prisons; andandbullet; Detoxification centers located outside of a shelter.Specifically included in the survey are:andbullet; Shelters for adult men or women;andbullet; Shelters for families;andbullet; Shelters for battered women;andbullet; Transitional housing;andbullet; Boarding houses, welfare hotels, and single room occupancy (SRO)hotels primarily or exclusively used by the homeless that accept directclient payment;andbullet; Other shelters used to house the homeless; andandbullet; Commercial lodging providers that serve the homeless through voucherprograms and contractual arrangements.<ITAG tagnum="81">Sample Selection Methodology</ITAG>Sixty five first-stage units (counties/central cities) will be selectedwith probabilities proportional to size (PPS). The size measure will bethe maximum of the number of renters or 20 percent of the total population.Number of renters is considered in calculating the measure of size becauseit is likely to be more highly correlated with the presence of sheltersfor the homeless than is general population size. This correlation resultsfrom the tendency of the homeless to gather in more urban, densely populatedareas where most renters are likely to be found. There may, however, besome very large suburban counties with very small rental populations. Toprevent such counties from being excluded, and to control the variationin sampling weights, general population size is also factored into thecalculation of the measure of size. This approach should increase the accuracyof the survey estimates. (Nationally, about one-third of all householdsare renters.)Two hundred second-stage units (shelters and voucher programs) will beselected with probability inversely proportional to their first-stage unit'sprobability of selection, and all shelters and voucher programs thoughtto exceed a specified size will be selected with certainty. There willbe at least two additional size strata, with those in the larger stratumhaving a higher probability of selection whan the smallest size sheltersor programs. This procedure will ensure adequate representation of shelterswhich provide services to the greatest number of homeless. It will alsoprovide, to the extent possible, an equally weighted sample of shelterswithin these three size strata. This will maximize the precision of theestimates.B. Information Collection ProceduresAfter receipt of final information collection clearance, trained telephoneinterviewers will contact managers of approximately 200 shelters or voucherprograms for the homeless in 65 cities or counties nationwide. Sheltersand voucher programs will be sampled from a universe developed by reviewingCHAPs, other existing documentation, and lists obtained from the localareas. Interviewers will be trained to first identify the manager in orderto conduct the interview. Once contacted, interviewers will ask managersquestions to determine shelter or program characteristics, characteristicsof those served, capacity, and extent of use.Interviewers selected for this survey will have all undergone a rigorousand carefully planned training program that covers general techniques ofinterviewing as well as a session specifically designed to familiarizethem with and enable them to administer the Survey of Shelters for theHomeless.C. Pre-TestingDuring the month of August 1988, project staff will pretest this questionnairewith no more than nine shelter managers in cities not included in the sample.This pretesting and subsequent review may result in revisions to the draftquestionnaire.D. Expected Response RateA very high response rate (90% or more) is anticipated in this survey.This response rate is anticipated based on the 95 percent response rateachieved in the 1984 suvey. A high response rate was achieved across stratain 1984, and it is anticipated that similar rates will be achieved in thissurvey. Oversampling will be provided to allow for nonresponse and out-of-scopeshelters (e.g., shelter no longer exists). For a sample size of 200 and an estimated proportion of 50 percent, the95 percent confidence interval, excluding design effects, is 50 andplusmin;6.9 percent. At an estimated proportion of 10 percent, the corresponding95 percent confidence interval is 10 andplusmin; 4.2 percent, excluding designeffects.E. Sampling StatisticiansThe sampling approach for this survey was designed by David Marker andDavid Morganstein, sampling statisticians with Westat, Inc., and was implementedunder their supervision.Telephone numbers are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="14">David Marker (301) 251-1500</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">David Morganstein, (301) 251-1500</ITAG>F. Confidentiality ProvisionsTo ensure that the data collected are processed in a confidential manner,a set of standard procedures will be followed:andbullet; All project staff will sign an assurance of confidentiality.andbullet; Employees will keep completely confidential the names of all shelterrespondents, all information or opinions collected in the course of interviews,and any information about respondents learned incidentally.andbullet; Survey data containing personal identifiers will be kept in alocked container when not being used each working day in routine surveyactivities. Reasonable caution will be exercised in limiting access tosurvey data only to persons working on the project who have been instructedin the applicable confidentiality requirements for the project.andbullet; The project director and survey manager will be responsible forensuring that all personnel involved in handling survey data on the projectare instructed in these procedures, have signed the pledge, and complywith these procedures throughout the period of survey performance.andbullet; Special handling instructions not only will demand enforcementof the confidentiality of received questionnaires, but will assure strictcontrol of questionnaire whereabouts.To assure respondents of the confidentiality of the data collected, interviewerswill read the following statement before beginning each interview:<ITAG tagnum="21">Before I begin I'd like to inform you that your response is voluntaryand the information you provide will be treated as confidential and willonly be used in combination with other responses in statistical reports.No information other than city name will be published or released thatidentifies individual respondents or shelters with their responses.</ITAG>To ensure that the data will not be used in an inappropriate or unauthorizedmanner while in the care of the contractors, standard confidentiality procedureswill also be used. All the necessary information and documents relatingto computer data files will be kept in a file accessible only by projectanalysts under the supervision of the project director. Final analysisand reporting of the data will not contain identifying information suchas name, address, or telephone number.G. RemunerationNo remuneration of any kind is being offered to any respondents to theproposed survey.H. Tabulation and Publication<ITAG tagnum="81">Tabulation</ITAG>The data collected by telephone interview will be coded, key entered, andcleaned by the contractor. The resulting data file will be computer-processedby standard statistical software packages.A set of frequency distributions on all collected items will be made. Acritical examination of the quality of the data shall be prepared and sumbitted.It will include comment on accuracy, validity, response rates, extent ofmissing data, and known and potential biases. The contractor will alsoprovide a report that explains the methodology, identifies the number ofresponses and relative precents, and details the work performed under thecontract, including data and procedural recommendations.<ITAG tagnum="81">Publication</ITAG>HUD will use contractor provided information and additional tabulationsproduced by HUD analysts in preparing a report on homeless shelters.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Time Schedule</ITAG>The contract for the survey of shelters for the homeless was awarded inJune 1988 and is expected to be completed before the end of 1988. It isanticipated that interviews will be conducted in the August 22nd to September5th time period, assuming extensive modifications are not required followingpretesting, OMB and HUD reviews, and the instrument approval process. Deliveryof data file and documentation is expected approximately three weeks aftercompletion of interviews.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Outside Consultation</ITAG>A. Public ContactsIn addition to talking to members of various offices within HUD, the contractorhas discussed the issues with shelter managers and others concerned withproblems of homelessness to determine what information is readily availableand the terminology and units of measure commonly used.B. Identity of Informaiton CollectorsTelephone survey data will be collected by employees of Westat, Inc., 1650Research Blvd., Rockville, MD 20850.<ITAG tagnum="84">5. Respondents Burden</ITAG>The total respondent burden for this one-time data collection is 100 hoursbased on 200 respondents at one-half hour each. No special record keepingis required. Nearly all responses can be made by recall. A few questionsinvolve referral to readily available statistics on numbers of clientsusing shelter. There is very little variation in burden from one respondentto another since there are very few skip patterns, all of which are short.<ITAG tagnum="84">6. Sensitive Questions</ITAG>None of the questions deal with sensitive matters.<ITAG tagnum="84">7. Cost to the Federal Government</ITAG>The total cost of the proposed data collection to the Federal Governmentwill be approximately $55,000. This includes the cost of the sampling activities,developing the survey instrument, collecting data by telephone, and providingfrequency distributions and an edited data set on floppy diskette.<ITAG tagnum="84">8. Item Justification</ITAG>A. OverviewThe following section provides a description of questionnaire items inthe Survey of Shelters for the Homeless and a justification of the meansby which each of the questions support the overall research plan. Groupingsinclude: General shelter characteristics; eligibility and rules; characteristicsof users; manpower and cost; and administrative problems.The questionnaire is designed to capture such information as capacity,services provided, facilities included, extent of use, and staffing. Questionswill also focus on the type of person most likely to use a shelter. Thesecharacteristics include sex, family status, mental illness, employment,and other problems.B. Shelter CharacteristicsQuestions under this heading will provide general information about thecharacteristics of the shelter. To determine these, the following questionsare included:<ITAG tagnum="15">SH1-VP5.
