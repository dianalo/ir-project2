William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAdministration, was among those who wanted U.S. representatives tomake an official diplomatic overture to that effect at a UnitedNations-sponsored meeting that begins Monday in Geneva, theadministration officials said.   The proponents _ including Fred Bernthal, the assistantsecretary of state for oceans and international environmentalaffairs _ contended it would be a strong symbolic move for Bush tourge a convention of nations to develop a framework agreement onhow to combat the global warming trend known as the greenhouseeffect.   Bush promised during the presidential campaign last year that hewould be an environmental president and would call an internationalenvironmental conference to focus on tackling global warming.   However, Sununu and others took the position that the governmentis not yet ready to take such a step because more analysis isneeded on economic and other effects of the dramatic actions neededagainst global warming, officials said.   EPA spokesman David Cohen on Saturday said Reilly understoodSununu's cautious approach.   ``Basically he (Sununu) has been extremely supportive and he hassaid only that he has some questions that he wants answers,'' saidCohen, adding that Reilly believes the questions ``deserveanswers.''   Although the proponents felt it would show a positive approachand would cost little for the United States to stake out aleadership position on the idea, Cohen said Reilly believesSununu's position was ``extremely reasonable.''   However, other officials were known to believe Bush was missingthe boat at a chance to show environmental leadership.   Sununu's office did not return calls for comment on Saturday.   The idea being pushed would have been a formal U.S. statement toother nations, urging an international framework convention tonegotiate such matters as joint monitoring, research, and othercooperative efforts on global warming, said William Nitze, deputyassistant secretary of state for environment, health and naturalresources.   Nitze will represent the United States at the Geneva meetingthis week where a working group of more than 20 nations isdeveloping a report on response strategies to counter globalwarming. The working group, whose meeting will be chaired byBernthal, is part of the U.N-sponsored Intragovernmental Panel onClimate Change.   Other countries may take the official initiative to move towarda framework convention on global warming, but Nitze said thatabsent a decision from President Bush he will not be able to makeany commitment.   ``Politically there would have been an advantage to thepresident making a statement,'' Nitze said.   However, he said, ``The reason things are moving slowly on thisissue is that many people are concerned about the cost of reallyaddressing this problem.   ``For the United States to really do something to limitgreenhouse gas emission may require some rather expensive andpotentially disruptive policies,'' he added. ``There's a sense thatif we were really to try to reduce emissions by any percentage, wewould have to make some very major investments.''   The greenhouse effect is caused by burning of fossil fuels andother human activities that have loaded the atmosphere with gasesand increased world temperatures, scientific evidence has shown.   Many scientists say global warming will cause significant risingof the seas and radical weather and rainfall patterns with dramaticeffect on agriculture.   To turn around the trend would likely mean significant changesin everyday life, including finding alternatives to fossil fuelsfor automobiles and industrial use, creating dramatic impacts onthe petroleum industry.   Thus any U.S. position on global warming would havegovernment-wide implications, including in the departments ofEnergy, Commerce, Treasury, Agriculture and Defense and the Officeof Management and Budget.   ``Governor Sununu and others want to have a better grasp of whatrealistic options we could get people to accept before we startdown the road that could lead to a commitment,' said Nitze.</TEXT></DOC>
