Introduction </ITAG>This rule makes the Federal ``generic'' Underground Injection Control (UIC)program which is codified at 40 CFR Parts 124, 144 and 146, applicableto the Indian lands in the 41 States and territories listed below. TheAgency received very few comments on the proposed rule, and it is beingpromulgated almost precisely as it was proposed. (The Agency's responsesto the comments are incorporated into this preamble.) <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) authorizes and obligates EPA to regulateunderground injection activity on all lands in the United States, includingIndian lands. (EPA has adopted the definition of ``Indian country'' foundat 18 U.S.C. 1151, and set forth in full at 40 CFR 144.3, for the purposeof defining ``Indian lands'' for the Direct Implementation UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) program.) Section 1421 of the SDWA directs EPA to set minimum standards and criteriafor approval of State-developed programs. States may develop their ownprograms regulating their injection wells. EPA reviews the State programsand approves them pursuant to section 1422 or section 1425 of the SDWAif they meet the standards of section 1421. This is called granting primaryenforcement responsibility. If a State does not submit a program or ifa submitted program does not meet statutory and regulatory standards, theEPA directly administers a program for the State under the regulationscodified in 40 CFR Parts 124, 144 and 146. This is referred to as ``directimplementation.'' At the moment there are 34 full and 6 partial programsfor which a State has primary enforcement responsibility. EPA promulgatedthe Federal program for the direct implementation jurisdictions in Mayand November of 1984. (49 FR 20138 and 49 FR 45292) <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Indian Programs in States With Primary Enforcement Responsibility</ITAG>Because States generally could not or did not assert jurisdiction overthe Indian lands within their boundaries, Indian lands were not includedin the State-administered UIC programs. The Indian Tribes themselves couldnot administer a UIC program under the jurisdiction of the SDWA until the1986 Amendments gave them the authority to do so. Only the Federal EPAhad the authority to administer a UIC program for most Indian lands, butthere was disagreement about what type of program should be established.EPA announced four possibilities and solicited comments on them: 1. The current Federal UIC minimum requirements; 2. Requirements patterned after the approved program in the State wherethe Indian lands are located, to the extent consistent with EPA's authorityunder the SDWA; 3. A combination of the first two; or 4. A different program containing requirements that respond to the concernsof the affected Tribal government. These options were discussed in detail in <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices on September 2, 1983 (48 FR 40100) andMay 11, 1984 (49 FR 20340). Many of the industry commenters indicated apreference for the second option, a program consistent with the surroundingState. However, a State's legislative authority for its UIC program isoften broader than EPA's authority under the SDWA and therefore, many Stateprovisions could not be adopted by EPA for inclusion in a program on Indianlands. A hybrid program combining aspects of the State and Federal programwould not provide consistency. The permittee would have to contend withprovisions different from the State program and EPA would have to administerprovisions not found in the generic Federal program. On balance, EPA prefersto maintain consistency within the Federal programs unless specific deviationsare necessitated by local conditions or Tribal concerns. Tailoring a programrequires a great deal of work with the Tribe, State, and other affectedparties. EPA is open to future proposals for such tailoring. However, giventhe mandate of the 1986 SDWA Amendments to promulgate UIC programs forall Indian lands within 270 days from the date the Amendments were enacted,EPA believes extending the generic Federal program is the appropriate courseof action at this time for most Indian lands. Most Tribes have not actively sought special programs for the regulationof their wells. However, the Navajo, Ute Mountain Ute, and some other IndianTribes in New Mexico and Oklahoma did pursue special UIC programs. EPAhas worked with those Tribes to develop programs based upon the FederalUIC program, but containing some modifications and additions. Tailoredprograms for these Indian Tribes are published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>(and conforming amendments to descriptions ofprograms for their respective surrounding States are included in this rule).Modified programs may be developed for other Indian lands in the futureat the request of the Tribe. The 1986 SDWA Amendments allow Indian Tribes to apply for and assume primaryenforcement responsibility once EPA has promulgated regulations governingthat process. The status of primary enforcement authority will give IndianTribes additional opportunity for control and modification of the UIC programon their lands. Today's action does not preclude Tribes from applying forprimary enforcement responsibility.EPA is today extending the Federal UIC requirements to Indian lands inthe following States which have primary enforcement responsibility fornon-Indian lands:<ITAG tagnum="42">Alabama </ITAG><P>Arkansas </P><P>Connecticut </P><P>Delaware </P><P>Florida </P><P>Georgia </P><P>Illinois </P><P>Louisiana </P><P>Maine </P><P>Maryland </P><P>Massachusetts </P><P>Mississippi </P><P>Missouri </P><P>New Hampshire </P><P>New Jersey </P><P>North Carolina </P><P>North Dakota </P><P>Ohio </P><P>Oregon </P><P>Rhode Island </P><P>South Carolina </P><P>Texas </P><P>Utah </P><P>Vermont </P><P>Washington </P><P>West Virginia </P><P>Wyoming </P><P>Guam </P><P>Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands</P>These rules have been under development for several years, but they willtake effect 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. There is no retroactive application. A commenterwas concerned that mechanical integrity tests for all wells on these Indianlands would be scheduled immediately because he mistakenly assumed thatthese wells on Indian lands would be tested on the same schedule as thewells covered by the original Direct Implementation program. The five yearperiod within which all wells in the DI program must have an initial mechanicalintegrity test ends in 1988. Although all dates will be calculated fromthe effective date of this rule, it may be that wells on these Indian landswill be scheduled for mechanical integrity tests in fewer than 5 years.The five year period was chosen for the administrative convenience of EPA,and that of owners and operators because there were so many wells coveredby the generic regulations. It should not take five years to test the relativelyfew wells on these Indian lands. <ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Indian Programs for Direct Implementation States </ITAG>Most Indian lands in the States with EPA-administered programs were includedin those programs and thus already have operating UIC programs. The SenecaIndian lands in the direct implementation State of New York were not coveredby the UIC program administered by EPA because the Seneca Tribe had expressedinterest in having special regulations developed. However, recent contactswith the Tribe indicate that special UIC regulations are not currentlya priority of the Tribe. Therefore, the Federal UIC program is today promulgatedfor the Seneca lands. In eleven other Direct Implementation jurisdictions, no UIC program waspreviously promulgated because there did not appear to be any wells onthe Indian lands, and in some cases no Indian lands at all:<ITAG tagnum="42">District of Columbia </ITAG><P>Hawaii </P><P>Indiana </P><P>Kentucky </P><P>Pennsylvania </P><P>Tennessee </P><P>Virginia </P><P>Puerto Rico </P><P>Virgin Islands </P><P>American Samoa </P><P>Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Note the difference in treatment of these States in the May 11, 1984and November 15, 1984 preambles and those for which EPA clearly intendedto include Indian lands.) In some of these States Indian lands are being created where none existedbefore. For example, P.L. 100-89, August 18, 1987, recognized three Tribesin Texas for the first time. Therefore, EPA is today establishing UIC programsfor any Indian lands which now exist or may exist in the future in theseStates. Also, Indian Tribes are seeking to acquire lands in some of theseStates which may have the effect of converting some State-regulated wellsto Federal regulatory control. In the interest of consistency and to providefor future contingencies, it is appropriate to enact the programs coveringall present and potential Indian lands now. <ITAG tagnum="85">V. Indian Land Program for the State of Washington </ITAG>EPA is promulgating a Federally-administered generic program on Indianlands in the State of Washington, although the State of Washington assertedauthority over Indian lands within the State as a part of its originalapplication for primary enforcement authority. In a separate notice intoday's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA rejects the State's assertion. One Tribein Washington, the Colville, requested and received a ban on all injectionwells on the Colville Indian Reservation except for Class V wells. In theircomments on the proposed rule, the Colville endorsed the language EPA usedfor the ban. The Tribe also strongly disputed the State's assertion ofjurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="85">VI. Indian Land Program for the Wind River Reservation in the Stateof Wyoming </ITAG>A. Mechanical Integrity Testing Two commenters urged EPA to accept mechanical integrity tests (MITs) thatwere done on wells in the Wind River Reservation prior to the promulgationof this program. EPA has decided to accept well-documented MITs that meetEPA's standards as the initial MIT. Subsequent testing will be necessarybefore issuance of a permit, or within five years of the first test, whicheveroccurs first. B. Aquifer Exemption The SDWA protects all underground sources of drinking water, whether ornot specifically designated as such. The regulations define ``undergroundsource of drinking water'' very broadly as: an aquifer which supplies orhas sufficient capacity to supply a public water system; and either currentlysupplies drinking water for human consumption, or contains less than 10,000mg/l TDS; and is not an exempted aquifer. Under existing regulations, EPAmay exempt from the UIC program aquifers which have the capacity to supplypublic water systems and contain less than 10,000 mg/l TDS if they do notnow and could not in the future serve as a source for a public water supplyfor one of the reasons recognized in the regulations (40 CFR 146.4). Ownersand operators of injection wells may inject into an exempted aquifer. Some two hundred Class II wells, mostly enhanced recovery wells, are currentlyinjecting into aquifers with less than 10,000 TDS on the Wind River Reservationin Wyoming. There are currently eight separate oil and gas fields where injection ispracticed on the Wind River Indian Reservation. The formations receivinginjections are: the Darwin Sandstone (part of the Amsden); the Tensleep;the Crow Mountain (part of the Chugwater Group); the Phosphoria (also knownas the Park City); the Muddy; the Nugget Sandstone; and the Frontier. TheTensleep, Phosphoria, Nugget and Frontier are the major aquifers associatedwith injection activity, while the Darwin, Muddy, and Crow Mountain arerelatively minor water-bearing zones. Available data indicates that allof these aquifers contain water with less than 10,000 milligrams per literof total dissolved solids and therefore meet the definition of undergroundsources of drinking water (USDWs). Most of the aquifers in question serve as the injection zone for enhancedrecovery wells, and by their nature, are hydrocarbon producing zones. EPA'sresearch confirmed that the formations are not now used as sources of drinkingwater, and because of their hydrocarbon content are not expected to beused for these purposes in the future. The one salt water disposal wellis a converted oil producing well, and there is an active producing wellless than one-quarter mile away. The zone is part of a hydrocarbon-producingformation, thus eligible for exemption both because of the commercial producibilityof the oil and because the residual oil so contaminated the water in theaquifer that it is impractical to render it fit for human consumption.As a result, portions of these aquifers qualify for exempted aquifer status.The exemptions are approved as part of this program, allowing injectionoperations to continue without disruption. The boundaries of the exemptedaquifers are described in andSection; 147.2554. The only comment concerningthis exemption supported it. Exemptions are being made for the entire oil and gas fields affected. Thiswill allow for construction of additional Class II injection wells withinthe exempted areas without the need for future exemptions (although otherprogram requirements, including permitting, must be met). However, theexemptions are limited to the intended injection formations, and to ClassII injection. These exemptions will become effective at the same time as the program;30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="85">VII. Office of Management and Budget Review Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>The Administrator has determined that this is not a major regulation underthe terms of E.O. 12291 and does not require a regulatory impact analysis.This proposal would extend to a very small number of wells the Federalregulations already judged not to be major, even when applied to all injectionwells in the country. This regulation was submitted to OMB for review asrequired by Executive Order 12291. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The original proposal for the generic Federal program concluded that theFederal UIC program would not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. 605(b)). The extension of those generic regulations to a very fewowners and operators, of whom only some are ``small entitites'', will notchange the original assessment. Accordingly, I certify that this regulationwill not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 147 </ITAG>Indian lands, Underground injection.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 29, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
