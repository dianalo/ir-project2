Members of the genus <T3/><T3>Plethodon</T3> are also known as woodland salamanders. The Cheat Mountainsalamander (<T3>Plethodon nettingi</T3>) was first observed on Barton Knob in RandolphCounty, West Virginia, in 1935 and was described as a new species by Green(1938). Highton and Grobman (1956) considered <T3>P. nettingi</T3> to be a subspecies of <T3>P. richmondi,</T3> but later, Highton (1971) re-elevated <T3>P. nettingi</T3> to full species status. <T3>Plethodon shenandoah</T3> was first described as a subspecies of <T3>P. richmondi</T3> (Highton and Worthington 1967), and later consideredto be a subspecies of <T3>P. nettingi</T3> Highton (1971). Subsequent analyses of electrophoreticdata resulted in a determination of full species status for <T3>P. shenandoah</T3> (Highton and Larson 1979). The Cheat Mountain and Shenandoah salamanders are morphologically similar,small, slender <T3>Plethodons,</T3> reaching a maximum length of 11-12 cm (about 4\1/2\inches), generally with 18 costal grooves (vertical indentations that externallymark the position of the ribs) and dark gray to black bellies. The dorsum,or back of <T3>P. nettingi</T3> is dark, usually with a heavy sprinkling of brassyor silvery flecks. The dorsum of <T3>P. shenandoah</T3> is also dark, but in this species, there are twocolor phases, striped and unstriped. In the unstriped phase, the dorsumis uniformly dark and may have a few brassy flecks; the striped phase ischaracterized by a narrow red stripe down the back.As a general rule, woodland salamanders are found during the day underrocks and logs, or in rock crevices below the surface of the ground. Atnight, especially during rainy weather, they forage on the surface of theforest floor and occasionally climb trees or other plants for short distances(Pauley 1985, Jaeger 1978). The diet of the Cheat Mountain salamander,fairly typical for woodland salamanders, consists mainly of mites, springtails,small bettles, flies and other insects (Paulet 1980). There are no reportedobservations of mating for the Cheat Mountain or Shenandoah salamanders,but as in all other woodland salamanders, fertilization is internal andcomplete development takes place within the egg; in contrast with mostother salamanders, there is no aquatic larval stage (Conant, 1975). Eggsare laid in damp logs, moss, etc. Cheat Mountain salamander egg massescontaining 4-17 eggs have been found from May to August, with most observationsin June (Brooks 1948). Timing of reproductive activity is probably similarfor <T3>P. shenandoah</T3>.The Cheat Mountain salamander occurs in the Allegheny Mountains of easternWest Virginia, in Pendleton, Pocahontas, Randolph and Tucker Counties,in an area approximately 19 miles wide and 50 miles long (Pauley 1985),almost entirely within the proclamation boundaries of the Monongahela NationalForest. This species is found in forested areas above 3,120 feet, wherered spruce (<T3>Picea rubens</T3>) and yellow birch (<T3>Betula alleghaniensis</T3>) are or were the dominant tree species.Originally, red spruce forest covered nearly half a million acres in WestVirginia. Timbering operations around the turn of the century, in combinationwith wildfires caused by human activity, removed nearly all the red sprucein the state.The Shenandoah salamander is known only from north-facing talus slopeson three mountains in Shenandoah National Park, Madison and Page Counties,Virginia, at elevations above 3,000 feet (Highton and Worthington 1967).It is confined to pockets of soil and/or vegetative debris within the talus,where moisture conditions are favorable. Because, like all members of thePlethodontidae, these salamanders are lungless, sufficient moisture mustbe present for respiratory exchange to occur directly through the skin.However, competition with the red-backed salamander (<T3>Plethodon cinereus</T3>), which requires moister conditions than theShenandoah salamander, plays a major role in restricting the latter's range(Jaeger 1970, 1971, 1974, 1980). The Shenandoah salamander is classifiedas an endangered species under Virginia state law.In its Review of Vertebrate Wildlife in the <T4>Federal Registers</T4> of December 30, 1982 (48 FR 58454-58460) andSeptember 18, 1985, (50 FR 37958-37967), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceplaced both the Cheat Mountain and Shenandoah salamanders in Category 2,meaning that a proposal to list as endangered or threatened was possiblyappropriate, but that substantial biological data were not then availableto support such a proposal. Subsequently, the Service received a reportfrom Dr. Thomas K. Pauley, who had been contracted by the Service to investigatethe status of the Cheat Mountain salamander. The data presented in Dr.Pauley's report, along with other information assembled by the Service,including published reports by Dr. R.G. Jaeger on the Shenandoah salamander,indicated that a proposal to list both species was warranted. Accordingly,on September 28, 1988, the Service published a proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 37814) to list <T3>Plethodon nettingi</T3> as threatened and <T3>Plethodon shenandoah</T3> as endangered. With the publication of thisfinal rule, the Service now determines threatened and endangered statusfor these salamanders.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the September 28, 1988, proposed rule (53 FR 37814) and associated notifications,all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Comments wererequested from appropriate state agencies, county governments, scientificorganizations and other interested parties. Newspaper notices invitingpublic comment were published on October 15, 1988, in the Daily News-Record,Harrisonburg, Virginia, and the Inter-Mountain, Elkins, West Virginia.Six comments were received. Three of these, from the Virginia Natural HeritageProgram, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries and the NatureConservancy, Eastern Regional Office, fully supported the proposed listing.Another, from the West Virginia division of Parks and Recreation, alsosupported the listing, but strongly recommended continued fieldwork tolocate new populations and monitor existing ones. Monitoring will certainlybe a component central to the recovery effort for the Cheat Mountain andthe Shenandoah salamanders. Searches for new populations will also be importantto the recovery of these species, particularly for <T3>P. shenandoah, </T3>for which only three locations are known. Oftentimes,the increased attention received by species following listing stimulatesadditional research, resulting in an increased knowledge of the species'life history and distribution.Two comments from university professors, while supporting the listings,expresed concern that this action might curtail future research on thesesalamanders, particularly <T3>P. shenandoah. </T3>One respondent noted that the possibility of hybridizationbetween <T3>P. shenandoah</T3> and <T3>P. cinereus</T3> (not fully documented) could complicate protectionefforts. This writer raised the concern that legal protection might be``so rigid as to completely prevent the rational study of problems thataffect the species in question.'' With the publication of this rule, itis not the Service's intention to obstruct the acquisition of informationcontributing to our understanding of factors essential to the species'survival. Permits to work on these species are already required by theState agencies, as well as by the U.S. Forest Service (for <T3>P. nettingi</T3>) and the National Park Service (for <T3>P. shenandoah</T3>). The Service recognizes that the requirement fora Fish and Wildlife Service permit, in addition to those already required,may seem burdensome to the permit applicant. However, it is likely thatall of the above-mentioned agencies will use similar criteria in evaluatingpermit applications: i.e. the amount and types of information to be gainedby the proposed research and the critical nature of this information relativeto the species' recovery, weighed against the type and amount of proposed``take.'' Therefore Fish and Wildlife Service permit issuance decisionswill very likely concur with those already required by other agencies.This same respondent questioned whether additional U.S. tax dollars wouldbe spent unnecessarily on <T3>P. shenandoah</T3>, since it is already protected by its location onPark Service land. Fish and Wildlife Service funding of recovery, researchor protection efforts for <T3>P. shenandoah</T3> will be prioritized with the needs of other listedspecies and authorized only if deemed appropriate.In summary, while questions and concerns were raised by some commentors,all were in support of the listings, and no new biological informationwas presented.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations promulgated to implement the listingprovisions of the Act (50 CFR part 424) set forth the procedures for addingspecies to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangeredor threatened species due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Cheat Mountainsalamander (<T3>Plethodon nettingi</T3>) and the Shenandoah salamander (<T3>Plethodon shenandoah</T3>) are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification or Curtailment ofTheir Habitat or RangeHabitat modification is a primary factor threatening the continued existenceof the Cheat Mountain salamander. This species prefers cool moist forestswhere mature red spruce (<T3>Picea rubens</T3>) and yellow birch (<T3>Betula alleghaniensis</T3>) predominate. At West Virginia's latitude,these northern forest types occur only at higher elevations. The CheatMountain salamander is found only at elevations above 3120 feet (Pauley1985). Prior to the late 1800's, <T3>P. nettingi</T3> may have been more widely distributed in these highelevation areas. The timber boom began in West Virginia during the 1880's;forty years later, virtually all of the old-growth, high quality timberhad been stripped from the mountains in the eastern part of the state.Wildfires, some set intentionally to clear pasture, others resulting fromthe slash left from timbering operations, or from sparks from the stacksof steam locomotives, also contributed to the demise of spruce in the state(Clarkson 1964). Only one sizeable tract of virgin spruce, encompassingsome 200 acres, remains. Interestingly, one of the healthiest remainingpopulations of <T3>P. nettingi</T3> now occurs in this vicinity.Subsequent to the lumbering operations, the Cheat Mountain salamander somehowmanaged to survive, perhaps in small pockets of marginally suitable habitat.High elevation forests have since regenerated, and today, spruce and mixedspruce-northern hardwood forests cover an estimated 27,000-67,000 acresin West Virginia, roughly 10% of the area covered prior to the lumberingera (Bones 1978, Zinn and Sutton 1976). Although at present only 10% to15% of the red spruce in the state measure over 15 inches in diameter atbreast-height (dbh), smaller spruce are economically valuable in today'stimber market, and spruce timber sales are again occurring in West Virginia.The Cheat Mountain salamander's extirpation from one clearcut area hasbeen documented, and seven other populations that have been impacted bytimbering operations are likely to die out due to the hot, dry conditionsthat prevail in their habitat (T. Pauley, pers. comm.).In addition to timber cutting, access roads, hiking trails and pipelinerights-of-way bisect or limit the expansion of many <T3>P. nettingi</T3> populations. Such openings decrease soil moistureand increase soil temperature, thus presenting a barrier to these salamanders,which require cool, moist conditions. Due to genetic considerations, thesebisected ``half-populations'' may not be viable over the long term. Nearly40% of the populations Pauley (1985) found were bisected by or adjacentto roads or pipeline rights-of-way.Other activities that threaten Cheat Mountain salamander habitat includethe construction of ski resorts and coal mining. Within the range of <T3>P. nettingi</T3>, four ski resorts are in operation and an additionalone is presently being developed. Cutting of high-elevation forests forski trails, lodges and condominiums is ongoing as these resorts expand.One Cheat Mountain salamander population has already been subdivided byski slopes, and another presently healthy population is threatened by anadditional proposed ski resort and development. One historical populationoccurred on an area that is now developed as a ski resort (Pauley 1985).Although high elevation coal mining in West Virginia makes up only a smallpercentage of the total, high elevation coal deposits consist of low-sulphurcoal, which is becoming increasingly desirable, thus valuable, due to airquality considerations. Pauley (1985) reported five <T3>P. nettingi</T3> populations that have been severely impacted by surfaceor deep mining activities. One of these is likely extirpated and anotheris known to have been destroyed. Clearing and haul roads associated withmining activity broaden the scope of the impact of this threat of <T3>P. nettingi</T3>.Habitat of the Shenandoah salamander has been timbered and burned in thepast, which may have negatively impacted the species. At present, <T3>P. shenandoah</T3> habitat is protected from active modification, sinceit is located within the Shenandoah National Park. However, deteriorationof the talus areas in which it occurs could promote the incursion of <T3>Plethodon cinereus</T3>, its chief competitor, which could ultimatelylead to the extinction of <T3>P. shenandoah</T3> (see Factor ``E'' below).B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific or EducationalPurposesThese salamanders have no known commercial utility; however, in the past,considerable numbers of both species have been collected for scientificpurposes or as curiosities, by amateur collectors. It is debatable whetherunlimited collection can have any long-term effect upon salamander populations(R. Highton, University of Maryland, pers. comm.). Such impacts may beassessed through use of ``surrogate'' species (C. Pague, pers. comm.).Permitting requirements for collection of these species were mentionedabove.C. Disease or Predation There is no evidence that these salamanders are threatened by disease orpredation. D. Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms As mentioned above, collecting these salamanders already requires a permit,thereby providing limited protection from take. The habitat of both speciesalso receives some protection, since both Shenandoah National Park andMonongahela National Forest recognize <T3>P. shenandoah </T3>and <T3>P. nettingi </T3>respectively as species of concern. Despite this recognition,the habitat of <T3>P. nettingi </T3>is still threatened with destruction from a varietyof sources, as specified in (A) above, and <T3>P. shenandoah </T3>may be declining due to natural causes, as mentionedin (E) below. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued ExistenceThe existence of the Shenandoah salamander is threatened by a naturally-occurringphenomenon, competition with the closely related red-backed salamander,<T3>Plethodon cinereus </T3>one of the most abundant and common woodlandsalamanders. <T3>P. shenandoah </T3>is essentially confined to its few talus islandsby competition with <T3>P. cinereus. </T3>The species is able to survive there due to its highertolerance to dry conditions, relative to <T3>P. cinereus </T3>(Jaeger 1971). The talus in which <T3>P. shenandoah </T3>lives is in the process of disintegration. Organicmatter and the products of erosion accumulate in the less steep talus slopes,fragmenting them, decreasing their area and ultimately creating moisterconditions in which <T3>P. cinereus </T3>could possibly survive. As this process continues,<T3>P. cinereus </T3>is likely to invade the habitat now occupied by <T3>P. shenandoah, </T3>possibly resulting in the eventual extinction ofthe latter species. The Cheat Mountain salamander also experiences competition with <T3>Plethodon cinereus </T3>and with the mountain dusky salamander (<T3>Desmognathus ochrophaeus</T3>), which may limit the ability of <T3>P. nettingi </T3>to expand its range or re-populate areas previouslyoccupied. Pauley's survey work revealed one or both of these potentialcompetitor species present at 83% of the sites where he found <T3>P. nettingi, </T3>and their numbers exceeded those of <T3>P. nettingi </T3>at half of the observed population sites. Recent evidenceindicates that <T3>P. nettingi </T3>populations may actually be declining where thesecompeting species are present (Pauley, in prep.). The ability of <T3>P. nettingi </T3>to establish populations in unoccupied, suitable habitatappears to be limited. In an experimental effort to save a population,53 of these salamanders were removed from an area where habitat destructionfrom mining activities was imminent. These animals were carefully relocatedto another area of very similar habitat, soil type and temperature fromwhich all salamanders of other species found had been removed. Follow-upstudies over the past four years have as yet revealed no surviving <T3>P. nettingi </T3>from this transplant effort (T. Pauley, pers. comm.).The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the Service has determined to list the Cheat Mountain salamander <T3>(Plethodon nettingi) </T3>as threatened and the Shenandoah salamander<T3>(Plethodon shenandoah) </T3>as endangered. The Cheat Mountain salamanderis known from numerous populations within its limited range, and the managementof much of its habitat is under the jurisdiction of a Federal agency, theU.S. Forest Service. Although its habitat has already been considerablyaltered, proper habitat management should prevent this species from becomingendangered throughout its range. In contrast, although the Shenandoah salamanderalso occurs on Federal land (National Park Service), its population numbersare much lower and the management of its habitat does not appear to bethe major factor contributing to its endangerment or to its recovery. Thereasons for not designating critical habitat are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. Implementing regulations at 50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)state: ``A designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or bothof the following situations exist: (i) The species is threatened by takingor other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can beexpected to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or (ii)such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species.''In the case of these salamanders, the Service finds that a determinationof critical habitat is not prudent. Such a determination would result inno known benefit to the species. Nearly all of the known habitat of thesesalamanders is under the jurisdiction of Federal agencies (U.S. ForestService and National Park Service). Forest and park supervisors and otherinvolved parties are already aware of the occupied range of these species.Furthermore, both the Park Service and the Forest Service have their ownregulations which give high priority to protection of endangered and threatenedspecies. Thus, no benefit would accrue from designation of critical habitat.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibition against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperativeprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresagencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out arenot likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species. Ifa Federal action may affect a listed species, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal actions which could impact these salamanders would include landmanagement decisions on the Monongahela National Forest or Shenandoah NationalPark, and possibly, Federal permitting requirement for private actions,such as mining or recreational development. Such actions will require formalconsultation, unless the Sevice concurs in writing that the action hasbeen designed in a manner that eliminates adverse effects to these salamanders.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 setforth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to allendangered and threatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make itillegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United Statesto take, import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course ofcommercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreigncommerce any listed species. It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver,carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that was illegally taken. Certainexceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibitied activities involvingthreatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidential take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoologicalexhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with thepurposes of the Act. As mentioned above, the Service will promote the issuanceof permits for scientific research essential to the species' continuedexistence. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). <ITAG tagnum="74">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Bones, J.
