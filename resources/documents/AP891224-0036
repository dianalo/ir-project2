KISSEL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's no Christmas tree to brighten JesseCrabtree's living room, and the disabled coal miner has no holidaycheer this season.   ``He says, `Why get a tree if we don't have any gifts to putunder it?''' said Crabtree's wife, Edith.   Crabtree, 68, suffers from black lung disease _ caused bybreathing coal dust _ and has been hospitalized for two heartattacks and prostate gland surgery. He also was hurt in a 1976mining accident and now spends his retirement money on medicinerather than Christmas.   ``Now, Jesse just sits there in the bedroom, day in and day out,looking out the window. That's his life,'' Mrs. Crabtree said.   Crabtree blamed their economic plight on the bitter battlebetween the United Mine Workers and the Pittston Coal Group Inc. Aunion poster is taped to the wall near his bed.   Nearly 1,700 miners struck Pittston's coal subsidiary inVirginia, West Virginia and Kentucky on April 5, after working 14months without a contract. The walkout was prompted by Pittston'srefusal to participate in an industry agreement on how to fundcostly miners' retirement and health plans.   The UMW and Pittston failed Saturday in a last-ditch effort toreach a pre-Christmas settlement. Negotiations recessed with anagreement that both sides would return to the bargaining tableWednesday.   Mrs. Crabtree said she and her husband get $911 a month throughretirement benefits and black lung program payments. Their mortgageand medical bills alone exceed that.   ``We're making it from hand to mouth. We're poor but we'reproud,'' Mrs. Crabtree said. ``We had a little bit of savings putaway.''   For a while, the couple's Christmas dinner was uncertain.   ``I don't even know if I'm going to have a turkey or a ham,''Mrs. Crabtree said just before the president of a UMW local arrivedwith a 15-pound turkey.   ``She said she needed a turkey for Christmas. I told her itwould be no trouble,'' said Bethel Purkey from UMW Local 5815.   Crabtree is upset Pittston changed its pensioner health policy.After the old contract ran out, the policy began providing 80percent coverage after a $200 deductible. It had been 100 percent.   ``Pittston owes him and should pay his medical bills. They arethe ones that caused his problems,'' his wife said.   Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland said 80 percent coverage isa nationwide standard.   Cheryl van Tilburg, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross-Blue Shield inChicago, the nation's largest health insurer, said ``80-20 isdefinitely the norm for group coverage.''   Crabtree, a union miner for more than 37 years, also is upsetthe UMW worked for Pittston for 14 months without a contract. Hesaid it's possible the company would have continued full coveragefor pensioners if a contract had been reached.   ``If they had gone on strike then, they'd have a contract now,''Crabtree said. ``No contract, no work. If a fellow (strike breaker)wanted to go on in, you keep him from going. You can't have anyonegoing in while others are staying out.''   Mrs. Crabtree said a 100 percent health plan would give her oneless thing to worry about.   ``I'm 4 feet, 11 inches tall. He's 230-some pounds and I handlehim alone,'' she said. ``I take him to the doctor alone, pull thecar up to the garage. Don't ask me how I do it.''   One way she does it is by letting Christmas pass virtuallyunnoticed.   ``He needs me and he knows I'll be there,'' Mrs. Crabtree said.``Mister, I'll never let him down.''</TEXT></DOC>
