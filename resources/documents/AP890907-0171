The Polish union leader and Nobel Peace laureate, delivering aspeech in Bonn before about 1,000 people, also pleaded anew formajor Western investment to help stave off the collapse of Poland'sbattered economy.   In Duesseldorf earlier Thursday, Walesa welcomed U.S. proposalsto aid Poland, but said the United States and Europe should do farmore.   Poland's new Solidarity-led government is struggling to revivethe country's economy, weighed down by inefficient state companies,shortages of goods and a $39 billion foreign debt.   Walesa stressed that without major economic investment, reformcould be in jeopardy not only in Poland but elsewhere in EastEurope. He said Poles are ready to make sacrifices to attractWestern business investment.   He also addressed efforts by Poland and West Germany to forgecloser ties. Bitter feelings linger in both countries stemming fromNazi Germany's invasion of Poland 50 years ago, the start of WorldWar II.   Walesa, on the third day of a four-day visit, said he isoptimistic about intensifying West German-Polish relations. But hesaid the ``first basis'' for that is the ``inviolability of ourborders.''   ``We are concerned about a few voices in the Federal Republicrelating to the allegedly open question about the (western)border,'' Walesa said.   ``It would be useful, if this topic were no longer present in thebilateral relations.''   He called such discussion a waste of time.   Finance Minister Theodor Waigel and some other archconservativeWest German politicians have suggested former German lands now inPoland technically still belong to Germany because a peace treatywas never signed establishing the border.   Resentment continues among many West Germans about the forcedremoval of millions of Germans from the now-Polish lands after WorldWar II.   But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl reassured Poland thiscountry makes no claim to the lands and abides by the 1970 WestGerman-Polish treaty in which both countries pledged to respectexisting borders.   Walesa said he is not comforted when archconservatives in WestGermany say they are only pointing out a legal technicality.   ``If it is possible to interpret the situation in two differentways, then perhaps the situation should be changed,'' he said.   Walesa also said he was concerned by resentment among some WestGermans about ethnic Germans who came here from Poland and otherEast bloc nations seeking better living conditions.   A rise in ultraright sentiment in West Germany has been at leastpartly attributed to an increasing wave of refugees.   ``This emigration problem .... activates a wave of intoleranceand provokes nationalistic feelings. People, we must take charge andfind humanitarian solutions!'' Walesa said.   Kohl met with Walesa on Thursday and called for a new beginningin Polish-West German relations, calling this especially importanton the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II.   In Duesseldorf, Walesa was asked about proposed legislation inthe U.S. Senate that would provide aid of up to $300 million a yearand ease Poland's foreign debt burden.   President Bush has already proposed $100 million in U.S.assistance to Poland.   Although asked about the Senate initiative, Walesa insteadreferred to Bush's proposal, saying, ``What Bush did is in the rightdirection.''   ``This is not enough for the improvement of living conditions inPoland. It should be seen as having symbolic value, it should showpeople the way, it should animate people.''   Walesa asked again that the United States and other Westernnations invest $10 billion in Poland.</TEXT></DOC>
