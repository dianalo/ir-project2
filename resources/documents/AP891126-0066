The soldiers, many wearing gray wool army coats, gathered in anicy parking lot in southwest Moscow for the protest organized byShield, a group formed last month by troopers accusing the army ofhuman rights abuses.   Banners held aloft by the soldiers read: ``No to Violence andCruelty in the U.S.S.R. Army!'' and ``Life and Health to theSoldier!''   The rally coincided with recent articles in the Soviet newsmedia that have said the Red Army is falling behind PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.   ``The army is still in stagnation with corruption andnepotism,'' Lt. Vitaly G. Urazhetsev told the crowd. ``The army isthe place today where conservative forces are concentrated.''   Gorbachev's reforms could be doomed by a military coupengineered by ``Brezhnev-era generals and marshals,'' he said,referring to hard-line rule of the late President Leonid I.Brezhnev from 1964-1982.   Maria I. Kirbasova, who said she heads a committee of soldiers'mothers, told the rally that army conscripts are so gripped withfear they are afraid to speak out when they are beaten or sexuallyassaulted. She demanded that mothers be allowed to deliver food totheir sons, who she said are given the equivalent of only $2.60worth of food daily and receive a monthly salary of $11.34.   But Vladimir Savostin, an officer at the LeninMilitary-Political Academy, told the crowd the army turns boys intomen, ready to be independent and hard-working after they aredischarged. He said the soldiers have the full rights of everycitizen to seek justice.   The Soviet media have depicted a different situation. Among thearticles they have carried:   _ Lt. A. Shustov wrote in the literary journal Znamya that asoldier in his second year of service takes on the role of a``teacher.'' ``Often this so-called `teaching' is turned intotorture,'' he wrote. ``A young soldier sometimes ends his sufferingby shooting to death his torturer.''   _ A quarter of the soldiers drafted this spring had policerecords.   _ Standards of living for junior officers are close to thepoverty level.   _ privileges for children of VIPs in the army.   The protests against alleged military abuse has gained so muchmomentum that the armed forces' political department and branchesof the Communist Party Central Committee issued statements July 6denouncing the news reports. They said the reports were``undermining the authority of the armed forces, the prestige ofmilitary service, and the ties between the army and the people.''   Articles in the government-controlled press have said laxdiscipline has led to a caste system, alcoholism and harassment ofconscripts, including demeaning extra duty and physical abuse.   One case prominently mentioned was that of a Lithuanian soldiercharged with killing eight comrades in 1987. The soldier said heattacked the others after they had beat and raped him.   Virtually all men between the ages of 18 and 25 must serve atleast two years in the armed forces. The Red Army, with about 4million personnel, is undergoing a reduction of 500,000 soldiersthat Gorbachev ordered last December. </TEXT></DOC>
