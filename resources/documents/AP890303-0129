Two badly needed serums were located in out-of-the way parts ofIran and the Soviet Union, and with the White House getting theCustoms Service to waive normal clearance rules, were en route toSalt Lake City late Friday.   William Haast, director of Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at theUniversity of Utah's Research Park, maintains 1,000 exotic,poisonous snakes at the lab, which provides venom to healthorganizations and others for research and use in manufacturinganti-venins.   The 78-year-old man had been bitten nearly 150 times previously,and he thought he had built up immunity. Haast evidently did notinitially consider Thursday's bite by a Pakistani pit viper to beserious.   But he became ill and was in serious condition Friday at theUniversity of Utah Health Sciences Center, awaiting the rare serumsthat could give him a full recovery.   He already has been treated with massive doses of antivenin,including a shipment the Utah hospital obtained through an unusualairport relay involving a California zoo, a helicopter and a DeltaAir Lines jetliner.   Stephen Studdert, a special assistant to President Bush, said hegot a call Thursday night from an associate of Haast.   Studdert, who is from Salt Lake City, had given a speech thererecently describing Bush's ``kinder, gentler'' approach to humanproblems. An associate of Haast read an account of his speech,Studdert said, and called for help Thursday night.   Studdert said the White House switchboard relayed the call to hishome, and the associate, whom he did not identify, ``asked how wecould help. The serum could not be located in the United States,only in Iran and the Soviet Union.''   The presidential aide said he immediately set up conference callswith people around the United States and in other countries. He saiddoctors and other specialists advised the White House that theserums Haast needed were not available in this country.   What then transpired is an unusual joint-effort involving peoplein the United States, Iran and the Soviet Union, with planes rushingfor clearance and being met on airport runways by U.S. governmentemissaries seeking to protect the serum and get it delivered.   Over the next several hours, Studdert said in an interview, hearranged through U.S. government, medical and other private sourcesfor ``people-to-people, non-government'' contacts in Iran and directgovernment contacts between the United States and the Soviet Union.   Using an American interpreter who speaks Farsi, Studdert putHaast's representatives in telephone contact with serum specialistsin Iran, who located one of the necessary serums about two hoursfrom Tehran.   Studdert explained that two different serums were needed _ onefor young Pakistani pit vipers and another one for the older snakesof the same kind.   Then, he said, he put Billy Dale, a White House transportationoffice official, to work organizing the flight routes for deliveringthe serums.   Vials of the Iranian serum were flown by Luththansa to Frankfurt,where the flight was met by representatives of the U.S. ConsulGeneral's office and then transferred on an Air France flight toParis. The vial was then to be flown to New York's Kennedy Airport,picked up by a federal Drug Enforcement Administration helicopterand flown to LaGuardia and put on an America West flight scheduledto arrive in Utah Saturday afternoon.   Subsequently, Studdert and his colleagues located the secondserum _ the one for younger Pakistani pit vipers _ at the EnglishNational Poison Unit in London, and that a British Airways flightwas headed from London to Los Angeles with that package.   ``Doctors are going to go ahead and administer the serum from theLondon young-snake unit,'' he said.   In addition, another supply of the necessary serum was obtainedwith through the Tashkent Institute of Vaccines, workingcooperatively with the United States through the Soviet Institute ofHealth, Studdert said. That serum was put on an Aeroflot flight fromTashkent to Moscow and was being flown to Frankfurt for eventualshipment to the United States.   ``When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want todisturb the president,'' Studdert said. ``But I decided, this iswhat the president would have wanted us to do.''   ``We're not in the business of transporting pharmaceuticals,'' hesaid. ``But this was a case where the medical solution was notavailable in this country and we were happy to be able to play arole.''</TEXT></DOC>
