For many of them, springtime '89 will mean a second annual hikein mortgage payments _ 20 percent over a year ago on average _since that's when the bulk of U.S. homes are usually sold andmortgages originated.   This season also marks the first real test of interest-sensitiveadjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs as they're called, in an era oftightening credit. A government report issued earlier this weekshowed a 5.4 percent drop in housing starts last month, evidencethat rising rates are already having a major impact on the economy.Loan delinquencies could follow.   ``We haven't seen this before,'' said Robert Van Order, chiefeconomist for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co., or Freddie Mac.``ARMs became popular in the early 1980s at the national levelafter rates started to come down. This is the first period ofrising rates.''   Monthly payments on a typical $100,000 ARM taken out in April1988 are likely to rise at least $150 starting next month sincemost ARMs are tied to an index of one-year Treasury notes, whichhave risen about 2.5 percentage points from a year ago.   Interest rates, particularly short-term, have gone up over thepast two years in reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision tokeep a tighter rein on credit to prevent the economy fromoverheating and keep inflation in check.   Economists say they've already seen signs that that strategy isworking, and they predict that interest rates will ease by the endof the year. The sharp jump in payments of widely used ARMs willalso help to temper economic growth because it will limit manyhomeowners' discretionary income, they said.   ``People will find there's a lot of things they can do without.But they will want to hold onto their most worthwhile possession:their homes,'' said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the NationalAssociation of Realtors.   Twenty percent of all the 58 million owner-occupied homes in theUnited States are financed with ARMs, or about $800 billion of the$2.2 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt, according to industryestimates.   So far in 1989, ARMs have made up an estimated 55 percent of allmortgages granted. Economists, though, expect that level to declinebecause short-term rates have risen at a faster clip thanlonger-term rates, making ARMs far less attractive.   The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate conventional mortage averaged11.09 percent in April, up from 11.03 percent in March, while theinitial rate on an ARM averaged 9.40 this month, up from 9.09percent the previous month.   The typical ARM holder is someone who is relatively young andexpects to be moving up, as well as on, within a few years. Manypeople who take out these kind of loans also expect interest ratesto be heading south.   ``The adjustable-rate mortgage has ... kept the housing marketgoing at reasonably healthy levels for quite some time,'' saidRichard W. Peach, deputy chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation of America. ``Consumers have always been aware of therisks inherent with adjustable-rate mortgages.   ``Now the chickens have come home to roost and unfortunately wehave seen a worst case scenario for a borrower with an ARM.''   Homeowners who were drawn into the market by the artificiallylow ``teaser rates'' for the first year have seen the biggest jumpin payments.   A homeowner who got a $100,000 ARM with a teaser rate of 6.5percent two years ago would have had initial monthly payments of$819.46. In 1988 the rate likely went up 2 percentage points to 8.5percent, lifting the monthly mortgage payments to $986.11, or 20percent from the first year.   This year the rate is likely to go up another 2 percentagepoints to 10.5 percent, lifting the monthly mortgage payments to$1,152.78, up about $333.33, or 41 percent from the first year.   ``Mortgage payments have gone up a fair amount, but I don'tthink we're experiencing a crisis in the marketplace,'' saidStephen Ashley, president of Sibley Corp., a Rochester, N.Y.,mortgage company. ``I think we have seen a situation where thehome-buying public is now much more aware of the risks associatedwith ARMs.''   He and other lenders say that many consumers have been choosingfixed-rate mortgages, or adjustable loans that convert to a fixedrate mortgage during some period of the loan.</TEXT></DOC>
