TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The world may celebrate the end of theIran-Iraq war, but Israel will not.   Prominent Israelis say the 8-year-old war nearly eliminated thepossibility of united Arab military action against Israel, butpeace in the Persian Gulf could make Iraq's huge military machineavailable for such a campaign.   ``The moment this army becomes free there's a fear of war,''Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, a former head of military intelligence,said Tuesday on Israel radio.   Brig. Gen. Aharon Levran said in an interview: ``As long as thegulf war was raging, Israel could rest assured that the chances fora war here were almost nil. This security bonaza which Israelenjoyed up to now is probably coming to an end.'' Levran, retiredfrom the military, is an analyst at the Jaffee Center for StrategicStudies in Tel Aviv.   Statements of government leaders have been cautious, but oftenlaced with suspicion.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said on Israel Television he didnot believe Iraq or Iran was eager for a new war ``in the immediatefuture.''   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the right-wing Likudfaction of the coalition government, told reporters: ``We must bevery cautious from this moment.''   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left LaborParty and Shamir's political rival, declared: ``Iraq has built avery large army with over 50 divisions, with an air force... Thequestion is whether it will turn to rehabilitating its country orbe tempted to recapture its standing in the Arab world (byattacking Israel).''   The daily newspaper Hadashot said Israeli generals plan meetingsthis week to assess the possibility of Iraq or Iran turning itsmilitary forces against Israel.   It quoted unidentified Foreign Ministry sources as suggestingofficial concern that Iran might increase support for Hezbollah,its guerrilla ally in Lebanon, and encourage attacks on northernIsrael.   Largely because two hostile regional powers were fighting eachother, Israel has been able to reduce annual military spending by$600 million in the past three years.   Iraq moved closer to moderate Jordan and Egypt during the warand sent word through diplomatic channels that it would abandonopposition to a negotiated settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Analysts in Israel feel peace could change all that.   Iraq's peaceful intentions are considered suspect because of itshistory of sending troops to fight in past Arab-Israeli wars,including three of its seven army divisions in 1973.   ``I don't remember positive statements,'' Saguy said. ``Iremember all through the years that Iraq was a country which neversigned a cease-fire with Israel, and Iraq took part in all the warsso far.''   Expensive new defenses may be needed to counter the threat ofchemical weapons and long-range missiles widely used in theIran-Iraq war.   Israel and the United States are considering a $1.3 billionprogram to develop the Arrow, a missile designed to bring downincoming rockets carrying chemical or conventional warheads.   Zeev Schiff, a leading military commentator writing in the dailyHaaretz, criticized Israeli leaders for not taking advantage ofIraq's new moderation.   ``Iraq was ready for approaches on Israel's part,'' he wrote.``Egypt was willing to act as a bridesmaid. Due to one excuse oranother most of the Israeli leadership totally rejected thispossibility.''   Some observers feel Israel also missed a chance to develop adiplomatic initiative with moderate Jordan while much of the Arabworld was preoccupied with the Persian Gulf war. Instead, Israelsold weapons to Iran.   Although the extent of the dealing is unknown, the salesreflected the predominant Israeli view that non-Arab Iran posedless of a threat than Iraq, a traditional enemy.   ``We had an interest in selling for economic reasons and becausewe were worried about the fate of 30,000 Jews still living in Iran,not to mention Iraq being an enemy,'' said Yaacov Nimrodi, anIsraeli arms dealer and former Mossad intelligence official.   Joseph Alpher, acting director of the Jaffee Center, said in aninterview that one beneficial effect of peace in the Persian Gulfcould be a slowing of the Middle East arms race.   ``Countries like Saudi Arabia that have been seeking missilesand state-of-the-art combat aircraft will perhaps scale down theirarms purchasing, maybe not tomorrow but after a few years,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
