Unemployment sits at a 14-year low. The big congressional trade bill awaits a veto. And what ever happened to Richard Gephardt, the man who tried to become president talking tough about imports?    People certainly couldn't be blamed for pronouncing protectionism a dead issue.    They'd just be dead wrong.    Despite recent events, economic nationalism -- the new buzzword meaning &quot;America's economy for Americans&quot; -- is gathering strength.    The ostensibly free-trade Reagan administration has, on a case-by-case basis in the last 2 1/2 years, initiated or threatened twice as many actions against U.S. trading partners as in its entire first term. State and local governments from Pennsylvania to Hawaii suddenly want to control foreign purchases of American assets. And the threat of foreign competition so permeates U.S. politics that it will continue to influence policy regardless of who is in office.    &quot;We're bracing for a period of economic nationalism for the next five to 10 years,&quot; says Samuel Rosenblatt, president of the Association of Foreign Investors in America, a new lobbying group representing large foreign interests.    Normally, soft business conditions trigger protectionist feelings. But the U.S. economy remains strong after nearly six years of expansion. Now, according to pollsters, politicians and analysts, the driving force is a strain of fear in the national psyche that deepens as America's post-World War II economic dominance fades.    &quot;Americans are increasingly supersensitized to . . . losing control of our economic destiny,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst. &quot;Americans see Tokyo setting U.S. interest rates, and foreign firms pointing a finger at U.S. companies and causing them to tremble.&quot;    Democratic consultant Greg Schneiders blames &quot;a lot of complex emotional feelings against foreigners . . . being thrown in a single basket.&quot; People worry that &quot;foreigners are beating us in world markets, foreigners are coming in and taking away our jobs, that foreign investors are buying up America.&quot;    Evidence of the deep-rooted nature of current attitudes: 72% of Americans consider the nation's trade imbalance a serious national-security problem, and a majority see Japan as a greater threat than the Soviet Union, according to the political polling firm of Marttila andamp; Kiley. That's because a majority now believe that a country's economic power, not its military strength, most determines its influence. They perceive the U.S. as slipping badly.    &quot;America may be on the verge of a landmark debate challenging historic definitions of national security,&quot; concludes John Marttila, the polling firm's president -- whose partner, Thomas Kiley, advises Michael Dukakis.    Politicians have been quick to pick up on such sentiments despite the defeats of Democratic Rep. Gephardt and GOP Sen. Robert Dole, both of whom stressed trade problems. &quot;Short of body bags coming home,&quot; says Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman, losing economic control and jobs remains &quot;the most dramatic event&quot; to most Americans.    So Gov. Dukakis on the stump talks of &quot;a battle for the economic future of America,&quot; in hope of winning back to the party fold the blue-collar Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in '84. Vice President George Bush speaks of the need &quot;to stay competitive in this increasingly competitive marketplace.&quot; A candidate who looks like a wimp on the issue could suffer a voter backlash, Mr. Phillips figures.    Even the Reagan administration, an avowed foe of protectionism, feels compelled to respond. &quot;Some of our trade partners have taken heart from Congressman Gephardt's poor showing . . . hoping this will cause the administration to go easier on foreign unfair trade practices,&quot; Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said recently. &quot;That,&quot; he added, &quot;is wishful thinking.&quot;    The immediate outlook is for more &quot;piecemeal protectionism,&quot; a tactic already skillfully employed by the administration. During Mr. Reagan's first term, the government lodged only 10 complaints of unfair trading. Since late 1985, it has initiated or threatened 22 cases -- with the Europeans over pasta, salad oil, airliners, fruit, nuts, and meat; with Japan over computer chips, tobacco, leather, aluminum, beef, oranges and construction; with South Korea over insurance, cigarettes and movies. Other battles involved countries from Argentina to China.    In the Great Pasta War, the administration imposed 40% duties on European spaghetti and fancy pasta sold in gourmet groceries. The European Community retaliated against U.S. walnuts and lemons; the U.S. delayed a promised concession on semi-finished steel. Europe slapped duties on U.S. fertilizer, paper products and beef tallow, in a complicated tit-for-tat that finally involved several industries. It wound down only when the Europeans reduced their disputed pasta export subsidies.    More fights are brewing now, especially in the service economy. The administration has started pressing Korea to open up on insurance services and Japan on construction. Though the trade bill probably won't survive a veto, its content provides clues to budding conflicts: one over intellectual property like patents, another over financial services offered in the U.S. by big Japanese securities firms.    Commercial aircraft eventually may become the hottest potato. The U.S. government has demanded a halt to subsidies to Airbus Industrie -- a major Boeing Co. competitor -- by Britain, France, West Germany and Spain. If the demands are ignored, the U.S. could ban Airbus sales here or even deny landing rights to certain airlines from those countries.    &quot;The result (of such squabbles) is something I call ad hoc protectionism,&quot; says Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. He says import restrictions of some sort affected 9% of U.S. imports in 1981, but by 1986 it was 15%. The rise largely reflects so-called voluntary restraints on Japanese autos and foreign steel and increased restrictions on imported textiles.    State and local officials are devising their own defenses. When Britain's Beazer PLC launched its current bid to take over Koppers Co., Pennsylvania suspended Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., an equity partner in the proposal, from consideration for state business -- including a $150 million bond issue.    In Honolulu earlier this year, Mayor Frank F. Fasi proposed legislation designed to keep Japanese investors from &quot;buying our farms to build golf courses, and buying homes -- forcing values to unprecedented levels people can't afford.&quot; Real-estate agents say that because of big spending by Japanese wielding a mighty yen, a luxury home right on Kahala Beach might bring as much as $27 million. &quot;I don't think of myself as a protectionist,&quot; Mr. Fasi says, but that &quot;is more than the city is spending on the construction of a 200-apartment high-rise downtown.&quot;    Several states are trying, with mixed results, to use anti-takeover legislation against foreigners buying major companies within their borders. In the wake of Australian brewer Alan Bond's bid to take over G. Heileman Brewing Co., the Wisconsin legislature, in special session, rushed through a law to protect local companies from hostile takeovers by foreign holding companies. The law gave Heileman's board time to reach what it felt was a better deal with its suitor.    But an Ohio statute -- passed to help Federated Department Stores fight Toronto developer Robert Campeau -- was found unconstitutional for discriminating against foreign companies. Mr. Campeau eventually won out.    A concern that foreigners are taking away American jobs underlies much of the ferment over immigration law, says Mr. Schneiders, the Democratic consultant. Others see economic nationalism in the calls for Europe and Japan to pay more of their defense costs. In its national-security survey, Marttila andamp; Kiley found 84% of the public agreeing with the complaint &quot;While we spend billions to defend Japan and Europe, they are winning the economic competition and taking away American jobs.&quot;    Overseas corporations and their representatives predictably fear that rising public sentiment about foreign competition will lead to wanton bashing of their interests. &quot;The U.S.'s traditional policy of encouraging foreign investment is giving way to this flag-waving economic nationalism,&quot; worries Mr. Rosenblatt of the foreign investors' group. (He declines to name its sponsors; &quot;it's a sensitive question, you understand,&quot; he says.)    Others, however, argue that such sentiments -- properly harnessed -- can motivate Americans to compete more effectively. &quot;Economic nationalism can be a positive development,&quot; says David Smick, an adviser to domestic and foreign financial firms. He envisions it forcing the U.S. to develop the pride in manufacturing and exporting that has done so much for Japan. &quot;The U.S. is going through a transition period, but it doesn't have to be an unhealthy period,&quot; he says.    ---   'Ten years from now, who do you think will pose the greater threat to our national security then -- our military adversaries or our economic competitors?'
