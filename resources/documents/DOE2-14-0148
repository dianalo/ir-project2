<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-0148 </DOCNO><TEXT>A device was designed to solve a severe case of sand inflow into horizontalwells at the Athabasca Tar Sands pilot plant in Fort McMurray, Alta.The sand problem at this pilot resulted from a combination of three conditions:a fine-grained, cohesionless sand; the cyclic injection of steam; andthe production of steam, water, and high-viscosity bitumen. A new typeof filter, designed to overcome this problem, has application to thecontrol of solids in wells drilled in a variety of formations producingliquids or gas. It was first designed and tested in the laboratory witha physical simulator; then it was fabricated and tested in vertical wellsat the Athabasca pilot plant.</TEXT></DOC>
