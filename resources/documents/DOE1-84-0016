Three zones havebeen defined which make up the overall zone of mechanical disturbance:zone 1---a zone of fracturing; zone 2---a zone of significant straining;and zone 3---a zone of influence. The limits of these zones have beendefined based on domal salt and bedded salt and potash case studies andare presented as a first step in quantifying the limits of mechanicaldisturbance around underground openings in salt. It is emphasized thatultimate proof of the nature and extent of mechanical disturbance aroundopenings in salt and quantification of the significance of mechanicaldisturbance to salt repository performance will be established by detailedanalysis of the data collected during field testing at the actual repositoryhorizon. 111 refs., 4 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
