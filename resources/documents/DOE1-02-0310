The alloys were synthesized and subjected to x-ray analysis.The results of the identification of the x-ray pictures of the alloysobtained showed that these phases crystallize in the tetragonal systembased on the lattice of the starting TlInS{sub 2}. The solid solutionsin the title system were synthesized and the region of solubility ofTlDyS{sub 2} and TlInS{sub 2} was determined.</TEXT></DOC>
