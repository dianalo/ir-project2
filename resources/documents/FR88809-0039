(44 U.S.C. 1506)  The ACFR is proposing to amend its regulations by consolidating all informationon the availability of OFR publications in a new Subchapter D consistingof two parts, Parts 11 and 12. Information on subscriptions and officialdistribution within the Federal Government is presently dispersed throughoutChapter 1, with information located in 1 CFR 3.4, 1 CFR Part 7, 1 CFR 8.8,1 CFR 9.3, 1 CFR 10.4, and 1 CFR 10.14.  The consolidation of all regulations concerning the availability of OFRpublications provides a central, convenient source of information for usersor OFR publications. Additionally, future revision of these consolidatedregulations is simplified.  Some of the regulations consolidated in Subchapter D are out-of-date. TheACFR, therefore, proposes to revise these regulations. The regulationsare also restructured and reworded for consistency. Since several OFR publicationsare now available in paper, microfiche, and magnetic tape forms, some ofthe regulations are clarified to identify the specific form to which thetext applies. Also, present regulations provide that various OFR publicationsare distributed in the number needed, without charge to members of theGovernment for official use. The provision of these copies is based ona written request to the Director of the Federal Register, therefore, thisprocedure is included when applicable.   The availability of the slip laws and the U.S. Statutes at large is notcontrolled by the ACFR and therefore information on their availabilityis not included in the new Part 11. In addition to paper and microfiche,the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the CFR, and the United States Government Manual,are now available in magnetic tapes. The current prices and availabilityof these magnetic tapes are added in the new Part 11.  The monthly Federal Register Index and the LSA (List of CFR Sections Affected)are included with each <T4>Federal Register </T4>subscription and each official distribution.Statements to this effect have been added in the new sections 11.2 and12.1(e). Additionally, the monthly Federal Register Index and LSA (Listof CFR Sections Affected) are available as separate subscriptions. A regulationon subscription to the LSA (List of CFR Sections Affected) is added atandSection; 11.8. A regulation on subscription to the monthly Federal RegisterIndex is redesignated from 3.4(b)(8) to andSection; 11.8.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Affected by Court Decision or Act of Congress   </ITAG>The ACFR is interested in receiving comments on a proposed requirementthat an agency promptly publish a document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>when its regulations are rendered null and void,modified, or suspended by a court decision or an Act of Congress. Thisproposed regulation would satisfy the requirements of the Federal RegisterAct, (44 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), help maintain an orderly system of codification,and would be compatible with OFR's plans to fully implement a current updatedCFR data base.   The responsibility for keeping agency regulations current and consistentwith relevant Acts of Congress and court decisions rests with each agency.Failure of an agency to promptly remove, revise or suspend regulationsrendered ineffective by court decision or Act of Congress conflicts withthe purposes of the Federal Register Act. This proposed regulation willbe consistent with the Federal Register Act which charges the ACFR withregulating the supplementation of the CFR with a view to keeping the CFRas current as practicable. (44 U.S.C. 1510)   The Federal Register Act requires that the CFR contain agency regulationshaving general applicability and legal effect. Also, agency documents publishedin the CFR, as amended by documents subsequently published in the daily<T4>Federal Register </T4>are <T3>prima facie </T3>evidence of the text of the documents and of the factthat they are in effect on and after the date of publication. (44 U.S.C.1510). If an agency regulation has been modified, suspended or rendered ineffective,by court decision or Act of Congress, the FR/CFR system reflects the changeonly when the agency submits the change in a document for publication.This proposed rule would formalize the OFR's existing policy of requiringprompt publication of a document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> when an agency's regulations are rendered ineffective,modified or suspended by a court decision or an Act of Congress. In thisway, the affected public will be informed of the current regulations andthe FR/CFR system will be kept current in a logical, orderly manner.A practical consideration is the OFR's plans for a currently updated CFRdata base which would increase the efficiency of OFR operations and offerthe potential for Federal agencies to gain access to the most current textof the CFR. Changes to regulations would be entered on the CFR data baseby the OFR editors. In order to maintain an orderly and current schemeof codification, the OFR editors must be promptly made aware of any nullification,modification, or suspension of an agency regulation by court decision orAct of Congress.For these reasons, the ACFR proposes to add a new section 1 CFR 8.10 torequire that an agency promptly publish a document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> when its regulations are rendered null and void,modified or suspended by a court decision or an Act of Congress.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedure and Timing for Regular Schedule</ITAG>The Federal Register Act of 1935 provides for an official publication calledthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> in which all rules and regulations (of a Federalagency) shall systematically and uniformly be published. Under that Act,the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register (ACFR) is chargedwith regulating the ``manner and form'' in which the <T4>Federal Register</T4> shall be printed. (44 U.S.C. 1506(3)).The ACFR provided for a regular schedule for <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication in 1 CFR 17.2 Section 17.2(a) presentlyprovides that receipt of a document by the OFR in the ordinary course ofbusiness (8:45 a.m.-5:15 p.m.) is considered to be a request for publicationon the regular schedule, that is, 3 working days later.Before a document can be scheduled for publication, it must be reviewedto ensure that it meets publication requirements set out in 1 CFR ChaptersI and II. When documents are submitted late in the afternoon, the amountof time available for processing is severely decreased. As long as thenumber of documents submitted late in the day was small, this did not posea problem for the printing and overall production of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Experience now shows, however, that so manydocuments are being submitted late in the afternoon that assigning the3 day publication schedule for documents received late in the day is notpractical and does not allow efficient use of editorial and printing staffresources.This proposed rule would change the deadline for receiving documents forpublication on the regular 3 day schedule to 2:00 p.m. Documents receivedafter 2:00 p.m. would receive the next working day's regular publicationschedule. The 2:00 p.m. deadline would greatly improve the situation createdby a large number of documents submitted late in the afternoon and allowfor a more efficient production process.While the Administrative Committee recognizes that requiring receipt ofdocuments by 2:00 p.m. to qualify for OFR's regular schedule may requirecertain agency administrative adjustments, it believes that the overallbenefits justify this change.The ACFR has not provided in regulations for a regular schedule for SunshineAct documents in the past, although the OFR has historically afforded thesedocuments an expedited schedule. This proposed rule would formalize theOFR's longstanding policy of assigning a two day schedule for each correctlysubmitted notice of meeting issued under the ``Government in the SunshineAct'' (5 U.S.C. 522b(e)(3)). In accordance with the OFR's existing policy,each Sunshine Act document received before 4:00 p.m. is scheduled to bepublished two working days later. Each notice received after 4:00 p.m.is scheduled to be published three working days later.Sunshine Act documents are published in a separate section of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> under simplified formatting requirements. Thissimplified format allows an agency to present statutorily required informationin a clear and efficient manner while providing public notice as quicklyas possible. The OFR's abbreviated two day schedule is available becausethe simple, standardized format permits quicker processing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reinstatement of Expired Regulations</ITAG>OFR has received requests from agencies seeking to extend the effectivedates of rules after their expiration but prior to the annual revisionof that agency's CFR title. Agencies have proposed that they should bepermitted to reinstate rules by publishing a document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that would retroactively extend the effectivedate instead of promulgating newly effective rules in full text.The ACFR take the position this practice may not satisfy the legal requirementsfor rulemaking, is not conducive to maintaining an orderly system of codification,and is not compatible with OFR's plans to fully implement a currently updatedCFR data base. Therefore, OFR proposes to amend its regulations by addinga regulation delineating the process by which expired material should bereinstated.Retroactive reinstatement of lapsed rules is also inconsistent with theFederal Register Act. 44 U.S.C. 1510(a) defines the CFR as a codificationof documents having general applicability and legal effect. Once a regulationis superseded, revoked or expired, it lacks legal status as a viable sectionof the CFR and neither the regulation nor its effective date is eligiblefor amendment.The Federal Register Act obliges the ACFR to maintain an orderly schemeof codification. Logical, orderly development requires that a systematicapproach be employed in which expired regulations are removed and are reinstatedonly by means of complete republication.Furthermore, the practice of permitting lapsed regulations to be receivedretroactively would seem to run afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act(APA), 5 U.S.C. et seq. Such a shortcut to rulemaking does not allow interestedpersons to participate in the regulatory process. The APA requires thatagencies provide notice of rulemaking by means of publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and provide an opportunity for submission ofcomments (5 U.S.C. 553). In addition, a recent court decision has calledinto question the legality of retroactive regulations as infringementsof the right to due process of law. <T3>Mason General Hospital v. Secretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services, </T3>809 F. 2d 1220 (6th Cir. 1987).  In keeping the CFR data base current, obsolute regulations may be erasedfrom the CFR data base on the day of expiration. To restore this data,agencies should republish the full text in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>  For these reasons, the ACFR proposes to amend its regulations by addinga new 1 CFR 18.16 to require that expired regulations may only be reinstatedby publishing newly effective rules in full text in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Dates and Time Periods  </ITAG>In 1 CFR 18.17, paragraph (a) is revised in accordance with the OFR's currentpractice, to reflect the fact that many agenices now rely on computed dates.The OFR no longer expresses a preference for documents setting forth datescertain over documents setting forth time periods measured by a certainnumber of days after publication.  The ACFR is also interested in receiving comments on a new paragraph (c)that is being considered, which would require an agency to promptly publisha document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>announcing a new effective date in the eventan Act of Congress or court order establishes or changes the effectivedate of an agency's regulation. The ACFR holds that this regulation wouldsatisfy the legal requirements for rulemaking, relieve a presently existingburden on the public, help maintain an orderly system of codification,and be compatible with OFR's plans to fully implement a currently maintaineddata base.  The responsibility for keeping agency regulations current and consistentwith relevant Acts of Congress and court orders rests with each agency.The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., requiresthat agencies provide notice of rulemaking by means of publication in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. The ACFR takes the position that notice of achange to a regulation's effective date is an integral element of any rulemaking.Therefore, any change of an effective date due to Act of Congress or courtorder should be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>  The OFR has received agency rulemaking documents that contained effectivedates dependent upon Congressional action. Additionally, court orders occasionallyestablish or change the effective date of an agency's regulation. In eitherof these instances, the public is only made aware of the changes in effectivedates in a timely, convenient manner, if the agency publishes a <T4>Federal Register </T4>document. Clearly the public has an interestin knowing the date on which compliance with agency regulations becomesmandatory. In most cases, the public can rely on the FR/CFR system to supplythe effective date for any regulation.  In the past, the OFR has received a few agency documents, which containedboth an effective date dependent upon Congressional action and languageto the effect that persons interested in the effective date of the regulations,should call the agency's contact person. Such an added burden upon theregulated public is unhelpful and unnecessary when Federal Register publicationis available and required as the source of legal notice of rulemaking bythe APA.  Furthermore, a practical consideration includes the burden such a vagueeffective date places on OFR editors updating the annual CFR volumes. Whenagency documents refer the public to the agency for a regulation's effectivedate, OFR editors must call the agency to discover the status of each suchregulation prior to updating the yearly revision of the CFR volumes. Thus,the OFR as well as the public, must go outside the FR/CFR system to discoverthe current status of these regulations.  A second consideration is the OFR's goal to improve Federal agencies' accessto the most current text of the CFR. In order to implement this goal andmaintain an orderly scheme of codification, the OFR editors must know theeffective date of each regulation.  For these reasons, the ACFR proposes to amend 1 CFR 18.17 by adding a newparagraph (c) to require that an agency promptly publish a document inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>announcing a new effective date in the eventan Act of Congress or court order establishes or changes the effectivedate of an agency regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Updating Regulations  </ITAG>Some of the regulations in 1 CFR are simply out-of-date. The ACFR, therefore,proposes to remove or amend these regulations to reflect current publicationprocedures.  The ACFR proposes to make a nomenclature change in 1 CFR 2.3. The changecorrects the name of the OFR's parent agency to the National Archives andRecords Administration.  Some of the regulations in 1 CFR are gender specific. Sections that containgender specific terminology, 1 CFR 2.4, 1 CFR 5.3, 1 CFR 9.1, 1 CFR 16.2,1 CFR 16.3, 1 CFR 16.4, 1 CFR 17.4, 1 CFR 18.7, 1 CFR 20.1, 1 CFR 21.14,and 1 CFR 21.42 are amended to eliminate gender specification.  The title of ``The United States Government Manual'' is corrected in 1CFR 2.5, 1 CFR 9.1, the Part heading of 1 CFR Part 20, and 1 CFR 20.1.Also, the ``Federal Register Index'' and the ``LSA (List of CFR SectionsAffected)'' are added to the list of publications in paragraph (c) of 1CFR 2.5The ACFR makes minor technical changes to 1 CFR 3.2 and to the sectionheading of 1 CFR 3.3.The regulations at 1 CFR 5.2 and 5.3 are clarified by adding the phrase``filed for public inspection'' in place of the word ``filed'' in accordancewith the language and content of 44 U.S.C. 1503. 1 CFR 5.6 is also clarified.The categories of documents listed in 1 CFR 5.9 are clarified and expandedwhen necessary to reflect the current publication requirements of the OFR.In 1 CFR 6.5, the term ``index-digests'' is changed to ``indexes, digests''and the section is clarified. The OFR publishes both indexes and digests,but not index-digests. The term ``general applicability and current or future effect'' is changedto ``general applicability and legal effect'' in 1 CFR 8.1. This changeadopts the language used in 44 U.S.C. 1505 and is consistent with the ACFR'slanguage in 1 CFR 5.2. The language in paragraph (c) of 1 CFR 8.3 is clarified. The Code of Federal Regulations Index now contains the parallel tablesof authorities and rules described in 1 CFR 8.5. The ACFR proposes to updateand clarify this section to reflect current practice. The ACFR is clarifying the section heading of 1 CFR 15.4. This section'stext pertains to the reproduction and certification of copies of acts anddocuments. The ACFR is removing 1 CFR 15.5. Information on the availability of OFRpublications controlled by the ACFR has been consolidated in the new SubchapterD. The availability of the slip laws and the U.S. Statutes at Large isnot controlled by the ACFR and therefore, reference to their availabilityis removed. An addition to 1 CFR 16.2 provides that agency liaison officers shall beavailable to discuss documents submitted for publication with the OFR editors.This provision emphasizes the importance the OFR places on this aspectof the liaison officer's duties. The word ``agency'' is added to the text for identification purposes in1 CFR 16.2, 16.3, and 16.4. The OFR requires each agency requesting publication on the emergency scheduleto submit its request by letter. Therefore, 1 CFR 17.4 is revised by removingthe phrase ``if time permits''. The services provided in 1 CFR 17.5 in conjunction with the transmittalof documents by telecommunication are no longer needed due to the availabilityof expedited mail services. Therefore, this section is removed. The term ``unusual tabulations'' in 1 CFR 17.6, is changed to ``unusualor lengthy tables''. Additionally, a provision that the OFR staff willnotify an agency if its document must be assigned to a deferred scheduleis added to andSection; 17.6 to reflect the OFR's current notification procedure.The regulation on submission of an original document and copies at 1 CFR18.1 needs clarification and correction. The provision for documents printedon both sides in andSection; 18.1 does not reflect the current OFR practice.The ACFR proposes to amend section 18.1 to require that if an agency submitsa document printed on both sides, one of the copies sent by the agencymust be a collated, single-sided copy. Additionally, due to the availabilityof expedited mail services, paragraph (b) is out-of-date and is removed.The footnote to 1 CFR 18.1 is revised and updated. The footnote's referenceto a 1972 document is removed due to its age. The Director of the Federal Register's policy on combined category documentsis clarified in the proposed revision of 1 CFR 18.2. Some of the regulations in 1 CFR include the term ``rulemaking'' as twowords. The sections in the regulations that have rulemaking printed astwo words, 1 CFR 18.2, 1 CFR 18.4, the Part heading and table of contentsof Part 22, the undesignated Subpart heading above 1 CFR 22.5, 1 CFR 22.5,and 1 CFR 22.7 are revised to a one word spelling. In 1 CFR 18.3, a new paragraph (c) is added to clarify that receipt datesof documents are determined at the time a signed original and clear andlegible copies are received. Additionally, the ACFR proposes to amend section18.3(a) by removing the obsolete option of filing with the AdministrativeCommittee. A revision of 1 CFR 18.4 clarifies the OFR's format requirements. Languageis added to reflect the fact that the OFR does not accept press releasesfor publication in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The ACFR proposes to revise and make minor technical changes to 1 CFR 18.5.Obsolete copying procedures are deleted and paragraph (c) is revised andredesignated more appropriately as 1 CFR 18.3(c). An existing incomplete sentence is revised in 1 CFR 18.6. The ACFR revises 1 CFR 18.9 to require that documents conform to the currentedition of the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual in all mattersof style. Material on forms is included in 1 CFR 18.10. Obsolete material in andSection;18.10 is removed and a new provision added to provide that documents containingtabular material may be assigned to the deferred publication schedule.The inclusion of unusual or lengthy tables in a document occasionally necessitatesa deferred schedule as set forth in 1 CFR 17.6. The ACFR proposes to remove 1 CFR 18.11 because it does not reflect theOFR's current practice. The language in 1 CFR 18.12 is revised and simplified. Material reflecting the OFR's current procedures for the correction oferrors in documents is included in 1 CFR 18.13. A new paragraph (b) isadded reflecting the OFR's procedures for filing for public inspectionand ultimate retention of revoking or correcting letters. The ACFR proposes to remove 1 CFR 18.14 because it does not reflect theOFR's current procedures for correction of errors in documents. The ACFR proposes to remove superannuated material from 1 CFR 18.20. Provisionsfor agency actions by December 31, 1981 and April 1, 1982 are no longercurrent and are removed. Part 19, which is based upon two Executive Orders, has been amended byE.O. 12080. The ACFR proposes to revise the current authority citationfor Part 19 and 1 CFR 19.4 to reflect the addition of this Executive Order.The ACFR also proposes to add an informational footnote on the availabilityof the publication ``Specifications for Descriptions of Tracts of Landfor Use in Executive Orders and Proclamations'' to 1 CFR 19.1. The text of 1 CFR 20.1 is restructured. In 1 CFR 20.3, the ACFR proposes to remove the language requiring submissionon charts in duplicate and to clarify other language in this section. Itis not the OFR's current practice to require submission of charts in duplicate.To avoid unnecessary duplication, a phrase is added to 1 CFR 20.4 providingthat descriptions of administrative units common to most agencies willnot be accepted for publication in The United States Government Manual.In order to reflect current OFR procedures, it is proposed that 1 CFR 21.1be revised to require each agency that prepares a document subject to codificationto include words of issuance and amendatory language describing the preciserelationship of the new provisions to the CFR. The ACFR proposes to remove 1 CFR 21.4 and 1 CFR 21.15. Neither sectionreflects the OFR's current procedures. It is the practice of the OFR to accept an agency document that amendsmore than one title, or more than one chapter of the CFR. Therefore, theACFR proposes to remove 1 CFR 21.5. The text of 1 CFR 21.6 is restructured and language is added to clarifythe OFR's requirement that agencies must notify the OFR of the expirationof codified material. The ACFR proposes to add a new paragraph (c) to 1 CFR 21.8 to clarify thatchapter and subchapter assignments are made by the OFR, not by the agency.In proposed 1 CFR 21.11, the standard organization of the Code of FederalRegulations is revised to include a new example of paragraph designationsand a provision that any deviation from the standard designations mustbe approved in advance by the OFR. The reservation of numbers at the end of related parts or sections to allowfor future expansion is an agency option. Therefore, the ACFR proposesto revise the obsolete requirement for agency reservation of numbers at1 CFR 21.12 and makes the reservation of numbers optional. The OFR strongly discourages deviation from the standard organization ofthe Code of Federal Regulations described at 1 CFR 21.11. The ACFR proposesto remove 1 CFR 21.13 because it is not consistent with current OFR guidanceto agencies. The table of contents in a document must list appendix headings to thepart or subpart in addition to headings for the subparts, undesignatedcenter headings and sections in the part as described in 1 CFR 21.18. TheACFR proposes to update 1 CFR 21.18 by adding appendix headings to thepart or subpart to the list of items that shall appear in the table ofcontents. This revision reflects the OFR's current practice. The ACFR proposes to remove 1 CFR 21.22. The OFR's Document Drafting Handbookcontains guidance for agencies that need to reference between or withintitles. This functional handbook is the proper source of information andtechnical instruction for agencies on referencing between or within titles.The ACFR, therefore, does not need to regulate this procedure. The regulation concerning placing and amending authority citations, 1 CFR21.43, is clarified and corrected to reflect the current style used inpublishing the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The ACFR also clarifies 1 CFR 21.45. The examples in 1 CFR 21.52 are revised to reflect the OFR's format forauthority citations. It is no longer necessary to place the CFR citation referred to in 1 CFR22.6 in brackets. Obsolete language requiring the use of brackets is removed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Matters </ITAG>This is not a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291.
