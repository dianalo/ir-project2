Inc. also in St. Louis, &quot;Top IS executives are trying to foistthe [concept of the] CIO job onto their bosses before they are ready toaccept it.&quot;andP;  Many IS luminaries disagree with him, but, unlike the Peabody ISchief, were unwilling to air their views publicly.andM;John J. Davis makes a living placing IS executives in jobs paying more than$100,000 a year and helps clients create IS positions.andP;  He is not shy aboutvoicing his view of the state of the IS profession, saying, &quot;The CIO titlewas the creation of senior IS managers who are insecure about their careerprospects and who are trying to artificially extend their careers.&quot;andM;Kay Lewis Redditt, president of Cogni Tech Services Corp., an IS consultingfirm in Easton, Conn., raises another voice of skepticism.andP;  &quot;The notion thata single executive can straddle the business and technical worlds and effectan alignment between them is simplistic at best,&quot; she argues.andP;  &quot;IS mustchange, the executive suite must change, the whole corporation must change,to bring about such an alignment.&quot;andM;That's just it.andP;  Massive change is required, and change brings crisis,disruption and frustration.andP;  But it also brings opportunity for those who canadapt.andP;  Ask any IS pro who survived the transition from card to batch systemsand from batch to on-line systems.andP;  &quot;Many didn't make it,&quot; says Gary Gesme,current president of the IBM user group, GUIDE.andM;Now, IS organizations are being asked to adapt again, this time to a numberof cultural experiments, ranging from dispersal into the fabric of a businessto life in an independent profit center or spinoff (see &quot;The Selling of IS,&quot;July 1, p. 22).andP;  Some experts believe this current cycle of change threatensthe very existence of IS as a profession.andM;Not everyone feels that change would be bad.andP;  &quot;If we insist on looking at ISas a profession, then all we'll see are its limits,&quot; says Marilyn smith,second vice president and head of the Retail Information Services Departmentat The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Boston.andP;  &quot;Isn't it time werealized that our careers are with the company we work with?&quot;andM;This connection between career and the business itself may certainly be invogue, but making that connection intellectually may not be enough.andP;  ISmanagers also need to be aware of and understand, on a practical level, thestructural changes going on around them.andM;Many in IS, both upper management and rank and file, have already beendisplaced from their original home, the central IS department.andP;  Furthermore,some companies seem intent on washing their hands of IS managementaltogether, passing the work to outsiders.andP;  Houston-based Enron Corp., forexample, off-loaded its IS operation to Electronic Data Systems Corp. so thatit could concentrate on its gas and energy business.andP;  This off-loading trendstarted in the federal government and is now spreading to state and localgovernments, as well as into the commercial sector.andM;Some of the IS pros displaced in the off-loading trend are going to work forthe outside vendors themselves.andP;  For some, the shift can be positive.andP;  Theycould gain stock and benefits in a thriving professional services company andmore varied work assignments.andP;  Others will be considered unsuitable by thevendor community, and yet others will simply fail to adapt.andM;IS careers, those of CIOs included, are shaped by two distinct corporatecultures.andP;  One forms at companies that want to manage their IS workers.andP;  Theother arises at those that don't.andP;  In the first sort of company, technology,and by association technologists, are considered to be a capital asset,something integral to the business, which can give it an edge in themarketplace.andP;  Since technology becomes everybody's concern at such companies,the cultural walls between technical and nontechnical workers aren't veryapparent.andM;In the other type of company, by far the dominant group today, IS isconsidered to be more a cost than an asset, something separate from thefirm's main business.andP;  These companies seem unsure about where to put theirIS professionals and what to use them for.andP;  IS pros in these companies tendto be a management headache--and an expensive one to boot: an estimated800,000 COBOL programmers in the United States alone are doing little morethan maintaining old programs.andP;  Furthermore, in such companies, the culturalwalls are thick, which leads to suspicion and misunderstanding.andP;  Many suchcompanies are weary of carrying the benefits load for their IS employees.andP;  Anumber are exploring lower cost offshore options for getting their codingdone in such far-flung places as India, the Philippines and other countriesin the Asia/Pacific basin.andM;What will happen to these COBOL programmers?andP;  Some will go to work forvendors, some will move out into independent business units and others willsimply leave the business.andM;These programmers have been oriented more toward their profession than towardthe organizations they have worked for.andP;  This attitude--Have COBOL, WillTravel--has been a pattern for years.andP;  Know IMS or MVS and you can workanywhere.andP;  Who cares if it's oil, steel, food or cars, just so long as thetechnical resume gets more impressive with each step.andP;  With each refinementin skills will come promotion within the IS profession's self-regulatedworld.andM;This has been the pattern for years, but it has also been a trap.andP;  RodMonger, author, former academic and a consultant at the prestigious ResearchBoard Inc. in New York City, once described this IS career tree as the&quot;classic example of the Peter Principle&quot;--namely, that IS people rise to thelevel of their own incompetence.andP;  The skills that served the programmer wellmay be only marginally useful to the systems analyst, less so to the projectmanager who must coordinate people and resources, and virtually useless tothe IS manager who wants to project a business air.andP;  The problem, asPeabody's Price sees it, &quot;is that IS professionals are woefully short ofbusiness savvy at the time when they need it the most--today, as theiremployers begin to automate the management and revenue-creating heart of thebusiness.&quot;andM;Price, one of several CIO-level executives contacted independently of theCoopers andamp; Lybrand/DATAMATION survey, says that traditional applications, suchas payroll and accounting, are routine and well within the compass of ISworkers.andP;  &quot;But today's so-called mission-critical applications are different.andO;They demand a knowledge of the business at the initial designstage--expertise the IS organization usually doesn't have.andP;  It's no surprisethen, that companies are going outside their IS departments for such vitalsoftware.&quot;andM;Outsourced, Outspent and OutgunnedandM;&quot;Software companies are, even now, specializing in particular types ofinformation systems, such as cost accounting, logistics, manufacturing,marketing, planning and financial forecasting,&quot; says John Dearden, professorof business administration at Harvard University's Graduate School ofBusiness Administration.andP;  &quot;IS departments have neither the customer base norbreadth of experience to do this.&quot;andM;Researchers at both Alex.andP;  Brown andamp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore and INPUT Inc. inMountain View, Calif., say that total software development expenditures inthe United States were about $30 billion in 1988.andP;  Some $13 billion of thiswas farmed out to third parties, typically professional service companies,and the balance was handled internally by IS departments.andP;  &quot;The outsideportion will exceed the internal portion in the early 1990s, as the shift tofront office and mission-critical automation intensifies,&quot; predicts Alex.andO;Brown analyst Cato D. Carpenter.andM;Tim Pinette, a top flight technician and systems consultant at Unum LifeInsurance Co. in Portland, Me., is an example of one IS pro who has noticedthese changes.andP;  Foremost among these changes, he says, is outsourcing,end-user control of IS dollars and computer-aided software engineering (CASE)tools, which some believe hold the potential for reducing the number softwaredevelopers that are necessary.andP;  Taken together, these changes affect the ISprofession by reducing its potential for growth, for advancement into thebusiness side of house, he believes.andP;  In addition, he says, IS is beingoutgunned.andP;  &quot;Business people already outnumber IS workers by seven to one atUnum.andP;  That ratio is shifting to 10 to one,&quot; he says.andM;Control of the Purse StringsandM;Coupled with this outsourcing trend has been a shift in the locus ofresponsibility for IS within companies to independent business units and lineorganizations.andP;  The CIO survey shows that business unit managers are involvedin over 74% of strategic information technology planning sessions.andP;  And,according to INPUT, around 50% of all IS dollars are now controlled outsidethe IS organization.andP;  The Lexington, Mass.-based consulting firm Nolan,Norton andamp; Co. believes the number is even higher, more like 60%.andP;  In anyevent, end users are controlling the IS purse strings to an increasingdegree, and at the same time they are gaining independence from the ISorganizations in their own companies.andM;Harvard's Dearden warns that IS will never be the same again.andP;  He believesthat central IS groups will be dismantled, and the IS organization willwither away, as outside software specialists come to dominate the developmentof software and become the favored partners of business units.andP;  &quot;Theeconomics both of outside sourcing and decentralization are too compelling,&quot;he maintains.andM;Dearden does have one substantial caveat.andP;  Companies with large ISdepartments will not dismantle them.andP;  Instead, they will turn them intoindependent profit centers that must compete both inside and outside thecompany.andP;  These same companies may acquire professional service firms, justas General Motors Corp. purchased EDS.andP;  These software subsidiaries willconstitute an important part of the entire software market.andP;  But, as far asend users are concerned, dealing with these subsidiaries will be no differentfrom dealing with independent suppliers, Dearden explains.andP;  Turning the ISdepartment into a profit center or spinoff is &quot;the first step in aninevitable journey to oblivion,&quot; Dearden warns IS workers in smallerdepartments.andP;  &quot;With the exception of companies with large IS capabilities,there is no way in-house departments will be able to compete against softwarecompanies in the long run.&quot;andM;Hartog of Washington University agrees with much of Dearden's assessment, buthe feels that the consequences for the IS community aren't all dire.andP;  &quot;Thebest of the bunch will migrate to vendors and software companies and puttheir careers on a more professional, sounder basis.&quot;andM;Furthermore, he and others in academia are predicting a big shortfall ofcomputer science graduates by the year 2000.andP;  Alex.andP;  Brown's Carpenter addsthat the chronic shortage of programmers, systems designers andconsultants--especially project managers--will become more acute in thefuture.andP;  &quot;In a seller's market, these highly sought-after professionals aremore likely to gravitate to professional service companies, where there aremore visible career paths, attractive performance incentives, higher statusand varied work assignments.&quot;andM;While this situation may make IS pros feel better, it may not be good for thebusinesses they leave behind.andP;  If corporate IS organizations don't skim offsome of this cream, they'll become dangerously vulnerable and dependent ontheir vendors.andP;  The industry in a sense will have come full circle.andP;  Backbefore the advent of computer science degrees in the 1960s, corporationshired generalists and liberal arts graduates and turned them into techniciansand eventually IS directors.andP;  Many of them remained uncomfortable aroundtechnology and came to depend on their vendors, especially IBM.andM;Only those IS organizations with the necessary technical wherewithal to playwatchdog over advanced technology and, if necessary, build systems with suchtechnology will be able to play one vendor against another, says HerbMcCauley, vice president of information management at Harris Corp. inMelbourne, Fla.andM;Some companies are trying to improve the attractiveness of IS within theirbusiness by focusing more of the human aspects of the job.andP;  But sometimesthis meets with unintended results.andM;Smith of John Hancock, for example, is trying to integrate the ISprofessionals in her charge into business units, but many insist on bandingtogether in centralized groups to protect their status on the IS careerladder.andP;  When pressure has been applied, some of her technicians havedefected to nearby New England computer and telecommunications companies.andO;&quot;Our solution is a gradual process of educating and rotating IS workersacross the company.andP;  We're developing a much stronger human resourcesorientation, since it's people that are the issue here, not technology.andP;  Andcultures are the hardest things to change,&quot; she explains.andM;Washington University's Hartog warns that IS workers must be dispersed intothe operating areas or rotated within the first four or five years ofemployment or trouble will brew.andP;  The best place to start fostering a humanresources and employee development focus is at the initial recruitment stage.andO;&quot;Few companies are culturally prepared to do this at present,&quot; addsCogniTech's Redditt, &quot;but the number will grow, and these companies will showthe way to more competitive organizations.&quot;andM;In companies such as pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co. carefullyscreened talent is hired for entry level positions and moved among many jobsand physical locations throughout their careers.andP;  IS is an accepted startingpoint, but it need not be an end.andP;  Employees work for Lilly first and theirdepartment second, and this prevents the formation of the cultural walls thathave created much of the sensitivity within the IS profession.andM;&quot;At recruitment time, we hire for careers, not jobs,&quot; says Bruce McBratney,director of materials management development.andP;  Not all of Lilly's workers areinternally developed.andP;  The company does hire from the computer industry, butthe percentage coming from this source is small, say 5 to 10% of the total.andM;Companies with such homegrown cultures may be the best places to nurturebusiness-savvy technicians, but with their entry level orientation theyprovide no promised land for IS refugees.andM;Who will retrain these professionals so that they are fit to greet theemerging world of mission-critical automation?andP;  Will we be reading CIO gripesabout alienation for years to come, perhaps until the dataprocessingprofession as currently constituted just disappears?andP;  &quot;When I started out asa programmer in London in the mid-'60s, everybody was telling me that the DPprofession had no future,&quot; remembers Tony Vickers.andP;  &quot;They told me thatsoftware would end up creating itself.&quot;andP;  What Vickers has discovered insteadis that with every advance in technology more IS workers are required.andP;  &quot;It'sjust that they now work in different places in different organizations--inservice companies, not just in IS departments.&quot;andM;Maybe Vickers can be an inspiration to all programmers.andP;  He formed his ownprofessional services company with two other programmers in 1972.andP;  Today, hehas a $115 million business, Computer People Inc., with offices both in LosAngeles and in London, where it originated to serve the British market.andP;  Hismessage is that IS is evolving into a service business just like otherindustries.andP;  &quot;It's not so much a question of whether the IS profession willevolve,&quot; he concludes, &quot;It's mostly a matter of where.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
