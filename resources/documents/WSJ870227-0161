Crandall</HL><DD> 02/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   The American public has survived three years without Ma Bell providing complete end-to-end telephone service. When ATandamp;T was stripped of all of its local telephone companies on Jan. 1, 1984, many doomsayers predicted that this unseemly divorce would create chaos, lower the quality of service, raise rates and reduce the number of subscribers -- particularly among lower-income groups.    But the sky has not fallen. Telephone service apparently has not deteriorated, long-distance rates have continued to fall, and the percentage of Americans subscribing to telephone service has continued to rise -- even among lower-income groups.    The only apparent lasting ill effect from the greatest antitrust breakup since 1911 has been the substantial rise in local telephone rates. (See table below.) Since 1984, the cost of local service has risen more rapidly than the overall inflation rate. In fact, local rates have risen so much that the real cost of all telephone service, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has risen for the first time in decades.    But before you write your congressman, asking him to put the Bell Humpty Dumpty back together again, you might want to consider the cause of the local rate increases. They are not a result of the antitrust case, but rather a reflection of regulatory policies and competitive pressures that are beginning to wring the subsidies out of telephone pricing. In addition, they reflect the tendency of state regulators to allow rates to catch up with costs after a period of intense inflation.    More than 50 years ago, ATandamp;T was allowed to consolidate its monopoly over telephone service in return for submitting to federal and state regulation. After World War II, regulators responded to the rapid decline in long-distance costs by using the windfall to subsidize local service, rather than letting these lower costs be passed on fully to long-distance users.    This distortion in rates wasn't lost on a few eager entrepreneurs who saw how easy it would be to erect microwave towers and offer a dedicated private-line business service. After years of legal battles at the Federal Communications Commission, they were permitted to offer their dedicated service, but they realized that the real money was in switched, garden-variety long-distance service. MCI began offering just such a service in 1974, discounting steeply from ATandamp;T's rates, which had been elevated by regulators eager to subsidize local service. MCI owned no local telephone companies and could not have cared less about eroding this subsidy.    Had Congress and the FCC wanted to continue the flow of subsidies from long-distance to local service, they could simply have excluded competition from long-distance service. Both tried and failed. The FCC was reversed in court, and Congress failed to pass a &quot;Bell Bill&quot; that would have preserved ATandamp;T's monopoly. The era of competition in long-distance service had begun, and with it came pressures for more sensible cost-based pricing.    For a time, ATandamp;T resisted the new competition mightily, drawing regulatory fire and a spate of antitrust suits, including one filed by the Justice Department in 1974. In 1982, ATandamp;T settled the government suit by agreeing to spin off its local phone companies. No longer would it be allowed to use its control of local circuits to repel long-distance competitors. The decree also required the divested operating companies to develop &quot;equal access&quot; technology for all long-distance carriers and barred them from the long-distance business, equipment manufacture, and other advanced communications markets.    As a result of the divestiture, long-distance competitors, including ATandamp;T, now pay an access charge for originating and terminating their calls through the local operating companies. These access charges continue to be set by regulators at a level that subsidizes local service. This, of course, induces long-distance carriers to look for a variety of other ways to reach their customers, including private microwave relays and fiber-optic cables.    In order to reduce the incentive for long-distance companies to bypass the local companies through alternative distribution systems, the FCC instituted a fixed monthly &quot;subscriber line charge&quot; for residential and business subscribers. This charge, imposed in June 1985 at $1 a month, is now $2 a month for residential subscribers and $6 a month for multiline business customers. The charge is de signed to make subscribers pay for part of the fixed costs of the lines to their homes or businesses rather than adding these costs to the costs of long-distance service. This has allowed the FCC to reduce access charges to the long-distance carriers, which in turn pass their savings along to the consumer in the form of lower rates.    This exercise in rational pricing created a political firestorm in Washington, requiring the FCC to postpone its plans to increase the residential-subscriber charge to a level more in line with the monthly fixed costs. The $6 business charge remains. In other words, &quot;business&quot; can be forced to pay for services it consumes, but God forbid that government force a household to pay the full cost of its service. Nevertheless, a substantial revolution has occurred: Local telephone rates are being moved inexorably toward costs.    Given the above history, it isn't surprising that local telephone rates have risen and that long-distance rates have declined rapidly in recent years. It was not divestiture that caused this shift in relative rates, but the inevitable impact of technology, competition and a national regulatory commission that believed that rates should reflect costs. Had access charges to long-distance companies not been reduced, the long-distance carriers surely would have pursued bypass technologies more aggressively, which in turn would have required the local companies to raise other rates to cover their costs.    A further indication that divestiture is not to blame is the fact that local rates began to rise in 1981-82, not in 1984-85, when divestiture and the subscriber-line charges were implemented. This increase in local rates reflected a catching up with years of inflation during which regulators had tried to appease ratepayers by allowing utilities less than fully compensatory rate increases. As regulators squeezed telephone companies and other utilities, the ratio of market value to book value for their equities fell precipitously in the late 1960s and 1970s. In 1981-82, as inflation began to subside, real local rates were allowed to catch up a bit and the companies' market/book ratios recovered part of their 1970s losses.    The inflationary catch-up in telephone rates appears now to have ended. Interstate long-distance rates continue to fall dramatically and local rates are no longer rising very rapidly. The real cost of telephone service will resume its long-term decline. The antitrust suits are settled, and long-distance competitors are forced to battle ATandamp;T on a relatively level playing field. Technology continues to improve, and the FCC and some state regulators are even talking about the desirability of allowing competition in local services and phasing out local rate regulation.    Eliminating formal regulation of local rates would be useful for another reason. Such regulation provides local companies with an incentive to try to transfer the costs of other activities to local telephone service. This transfer, if successful, allows the local carriers to subsidize competitive ventures from local telephone rates. Until the potential for such cross-subsidies is eliminated, legislators and regulators will be reluctant to allow the divested Bell operating companies to enter long-distance markets or the markets for other telecommunications services.    The search is now on for some form of &quot;social contract&quot; to replace formal rate regulation. Once competition gets its foot in the door, the very rationale for regulation begins to crumble. Local regulators will be under intense pressure in the next few years to allow more local competition and less rate regulation.    ---   Mr. Crandall is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.    ---   REAL TELEPHONE RATES AND ATandamp;T STOCK VALUES, 1965-1986         Average    Interstate     Local       Telephone   Telephone    Telephone  Market/Book Ratio         Rates*      Rates*       Rates*    ATandamp;T    Sandamp;P 400 1965     147         N.A.
