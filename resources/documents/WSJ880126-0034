In his annual State of the Union address to Congress, Mr. Reagan tried to stave off the decline in influence that is widely expected to afflict him in his closing months as president. He attempted instead to portray achievements he seeks in the last year as a way to set the stage for presidents who will follow him.    &quot;I don't buy the idea that this is the last year of anything,&quot; Mr. Reagan told a joint meeting of the House and Senate, &quot;because we're not talking here tonight about registering temporary gains, but ways of making permanent our successes.&quot;    Though he attempted to strike a conciliatory tone with lawmakers, Mr. Reagan signaled that he is prepared to fight an immediate battle over the budget they just passed. The president pledged that he wouldn't sign any more cumbersome, catch-all continuing resolutions to fund the federal government, such as Congress sent him just before Christmas. And he said he would be sending back to lawmakers a list of what the White House considers several billion dollars of pork-barrel projects in that catch-all measure, asking that they be killed.    And Mr. Reagan proposed one immediate change in the budget process. He said that, instead of Congress passing its own budget blueprint before appropriating funds to individual agencies, lawmakers and the White House should start the process by signing a joint agreement &quot;that sets out the spending priorities within the available revenues.&quot;    Mr. Reagan also appealed for a new dose of aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels. A senior administration official said the president would ask Congress tomorrow for a significantly scaled-down amount of &quot;less than $50 million&quot; through July, of which about 10% would be military aid that probably would be held in reserve pending peace efforts. Mr. Reagan also urged quick ratification of the treaty he negotiated with the Soviet Union eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weapons and said he is &quot;within reach&quot; of a much broader pact cutting strategic arms by 50%.    In addition, the president called for a new emphasis on improving U.S. schools and for a new national commitment to a &quot;drug-free America.&quot;    In a separate legislative message issued last night, President Reagan asked Congress to approve a new program of tax-free bonds for lower- and middle-income families to save for college expenses. He also called for a reduction in the capital-gains tax, but a senior administration official said the unspecified reduction wasn't a legislative proposal but rather &quot;a goal of this president.&quot;    Mr. Reagan's speech was designed to kick off a triumphant final year in office, but a new poll suggests that his standing in public opinion hasn't recovered from the dive it took after the disclosure of the Iran-Contra affair. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 48% of those interviewed said Mr. Reagan was doing an excellent or good job, little changed from the 49% of a year ago and down from 59% at this time three years ago.    In the wake of the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, there appears to be particular unease over Mr. Reagan's handling of the economy. Just 34% said the president is doing an excellent or a good job handling the economy, down from 43% a year ago and 52% three years ago.    Mr. Reagan seemed to be trying to quell such uneasiness over the economy with his general assessment of the nation's condition: &quot;Tonight, then, we are strong, prosperous, at peace,&quot; he said. &quot;And we are free. This is the state of our union.&quot;    The president boasted that America's poor &quot;climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 years.&quot; But the percentage of the population in poverty during the Reagan years has remained far higher than during the Carter, Ford or Nixon presidencies.    Mr. Reagan acknowledged that maintaining economic growth requires coming to grips with the federal budget deficit. And that, in turn, requires a &quot;drastic overhaul&quot; of the budget process, he declared.    In their response, the Democratic leaders of Congress declared an end to the Reagan era. &quot;Over the last year, the course of America has begun to change,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia. &quot;The 'feel-good' slogans have gone flat with time.&quot; Mr. Byrd spoke of his view of government as a positive force. Voters, he said, are asking for &quot;government to build and not to tear down.&quot;    House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas outlined the specific legislation the Democratic leaders hope will get final congressional approval this year, including a trade bill and legislation dealing with elementary, secondary and vocational educational programs.    Mr. Wright, who often clashes with Mr. Reagan over Central American policy, also asked the president &quot;to give peace a chance . . . so long as there is any measurable progress toward solving that conflict at the table.&quot;    For the short term, Mr. Reagan pledged that he will use his veto pen often if necessary in his final year to keep federal spending in line with a deficit-reduction plan negotiated late last year with Congress. &quot;I can assure you, the bipartisan leadership of Congress, of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust our budget agreement,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. &quot;And this includes the swift and certain use of the veto power.&quot;    Beyond that, he criticized lawmakers for passing late one night in December a 1,000-page continuing resolution to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. He maintained that the resolution was laden with congressional pork, including spending for &quot;cranberry research, blueberry research, the study of crawfish . . . the commercialization of wild flowers&quot; and $500,000 so people from developing countries &quot;could come here to watch Congress at work.&quot;    The president said he will be sending such items back to lawmakers as &quot;rescissions,&quot; requesting that Congress reconsider and strike them out. Mr. Reagan said he would kill such projects himself if Congress would accede to his long-standing request for a line-item veto allowing him to strike individual items out of spending bills. In addition to appealing again for a line-item veto, Mr. Reagan called again for Congress to pass a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.    Similarly, Mr. Reagan renewed his appeal for a series of social-policy changes important to his conservative supporters. In a twist on his usual calls for ending abortions, Mr. Reagan pledged to work &quot;to remove barriers to adoption&quot; so that pregnant women will have an additional alternative besides abortion.    In his most general appeal for his philosophy of holding down the size of government, Mr. Reagan repeated a saying by the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu: &quot;Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish. Do not overdo it.&quot;    The president called again for an amendment allowing prayer in schools. And he urged the Senate to move &quot;quickly and decisively&quot; to confirm Judge Anthony Kennedy as a Supreme Court justice and to confirm 27 nominees he has nominated to fill vacancies in the federal judiciary.    The president broke little new ground on foreign-policy issues. He dwelt most extensively with his plea for aiding the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, arguing that America should aid the insurgents as foreign powers aided Americans during their war of independence.    But Mr. Reagan faces continuing public resistance to Contra aid, as the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates. In that survey, 57% said they oppose giving more military aid to the Contras, and just 30% said they favored such aid. The remaining 13% weren't sure.    The president does have strong popular backing for his other big foreign-policy initiative, the treaty he recently signed with the Soviet Union eliminating intermediate-range nuclear arms. The poll indicates that 67% of those surveyed, including 55% of those who consider themselves &quot;very conservative,&quot; favor Senate ratification of the treaty.    ---   John E.
