Fundamentally, performance assessmentis simply a method of expressing our knowledge about a site in a defensible,quantitative manner in terms of meaningful performance criteria. Oncedeveloped, these procedures can be utilized as tools to assist the CRPin resolving specific program issues. Conceptually, this involves theability to estimate site performance based on current information and,by postulating the effect of new information, estimate the changes inperformance estimates as a result of future program decisions. This providesa means of examining the probable outcome of alternative program decisionswithout actually carrying out these decisions. The probable results ofdifferent program decision paths can then be compared to determine theoptimum choice based on current information. The performance-based proceduresrely on the implementation of a general performance assessment systemto predict site performance. This system or framework must be at leastpartially in place in order to implement any of the performance-basedprocedures. Essentially this would involve identification of programrequirements, analysis of processes and characteristics that determinecompliance with requirements, development of a procedure to assess sitecharacterization and uncertainties, and development of models to estimateperformance. Although the framework needs to be defensible and repeatable,it need not include complex and sophisticated models. Rather, the modelsand procedures should be consistent with the level of available informationat any stage in the program. 65 refs., 54 figs., 12 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
