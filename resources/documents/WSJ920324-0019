Itis low tide on a winter night, when the slag dumped in thewater by nearby mines coats the beach of this North Sea port.Scraping madly in the frigid surf, the Dawes can skim threetons of cheap fuel -- worth about $40 -- before the tiderolls in.</LP><TEXT>   Paul, a slight youth with blistered hands and chappedlips, has been &quot;humping sea coal&quot; for only two weeks. &quot;Schoolwas a bore,&quot; he says, stooping in the dark for another loadof coal. &quot;Least now, I'm doing what suits me. Like Dad.&quot;   For generations in England's industrial cities, it wentsomething like this: Son left school at 14 or 15 and followedhis father into the steelworks, shipyard or coal pit. Today,after decades of decline, those traditional jobs are almostgone. Yet the old pattern persists. Working-class childrenleave school at the earliest chance: to join the dole queue,to train in dwindling trades or to do Dickensian jobs such assea coaling.   &quot;We're drifting into the backwaters of Europe,&quot; says JohnSaville, an economic historian at Hull University. &quot;If thingsdon't change, we'll become an ill-educated outpost withnothing to sell but our heritage.&quot;   The roots of this malaise go much deeper than the currentrecession (by some measures, the country's worst downturnsince the 1930s). England's rigid class structure, itsexclusive education system and its welfare state allreinforce a stagnant status quo. This may bode furtherdecline as Europe's economy integrates and jobs become morecomplex. About 70% of French youths, and 81% of WesternGermans, remain in full-time education at the age of 18. InBritain the figure is 36%. The proportion of British workerswith skills is below even traditional laggards such asPortugal.   Hartlepool, in England's northern rust belt, is a windowinto this country's resilient working-class culture. Acentury ago, this was England's third busiest port, thrivingon the export of coal, iron and other products. But thedecline of Britain's empire and trade gutted the industrialnorth. This city of 94,000 now is dotted with derelict docks,boarded-up shops and grim housing projects with unemploymentat 17.3%.   &quot;It's a pit,&quot; says 15-year-old Paul Weldon, echoing theview of many of his peers. A want ad in the local paper, fora gravedigger, attracts 120 applicants. Entertainment also isscarce. The last movie theater closed in 1983.   Yet the population here is relatively stable, andneighborhoods are almost village-like in their provincialism.With the cheapest compact cars in England costing almost$10,000, and gasoline $4 a gallon, few low-income families inHartlepool own cars. London, 250 miles away, is for most adistant place seen only on TV serials. Even the coal-miningtowns just five miles up the coast are viewed as alien turf,inhabited by &quot;pit yackers,&quot; so-called because their accentand slang are hard for Hartlepudlians to understand.   &quot;People here don't move from one street to the next,unless the bank takes their house,&quot; says Wayne Smith, sippinga pint of beer at the Red Admiral pub, as fellow drinkersindulge in renditions of &quot;Que Sera&quot; and &quot;Make the World GoAway.&quot;   Mr. Smith, who is 19 and unemployed, spent the day typinghis resume. But since he doesn't drive -- no family car topractice with, no money for lessons -- he's disqualified formany jobs, and also can't easily reach other towns. Yet hehasn't considered relocating. &quot;I'm not a traveling man,&quot; hesays. Apart from a soccer match in Newcastle, 25 miles north,he's barely left the county.   Such immobility is social as well as geographic. The&quot;accursed itch of class difference&quot; decried by George Orwellin 1937 still infects almost every aspect of life andlanguage. In a recent survey, two-thirds of Britonsidentified themselves as working class. Decades of Laborgovernment haven't changed this, nor have Tory declarationsthat their goal is the creation of a classless society.   If anything, inequality is widening. The top 20% inBritain now command 42% of the nation's total income, thebottom fifth just 8%. This isn't as stark as in America,where the top fifth possess 47%, the poorest just 3.9%, butit's the biggest gap in Britain since 1949. &quot;There has been areversal in one decade of the changes in the previous three,&quot;says Anthony Atkinson, an expert on income distribution atthe London School of Economics.   Social standing, though, is as much self-image as economicstatus. In Hartlepool, people are proud to be working class.Or upper working class. Or lower working class. Or &quot;scruffs&quot;or &quot;scroungers.&quot; The divisions within the working classnumber at least five.   &quot;I'm basically middle working class but my attitudes aremore upper working class,&quot; says William Adamson, a miner'sson who has been in and out of factory jobs. &quot;I mean, I makethe same money as me dad, but I wouldn't talk to him aboutthe latest news from Yugoslavia.&quot;   Reg Smythe, who grew up in Hartlepool's slums and went onto create the cartoon &quot;Andy Capp,&quot; widely syndicated in theU.S., says the working class used to differentiate itself byits shoes. The upper tier had &quot;proper shoes,&quot; the next rankhad boots, the next &quot;plimps&quot; (sneakers), and so on, to barefeet -- Mr. Smythe's group. &quot;We were the only ones who didn'thave anyone to look down on,&quot; he says.   Mr. Smythe left school at 14 and later moved to London,where he drew Andy Capp, which he regards as a documentaryportrait of working-class life. Now 74, Mr. Smythe has movedback to Hartlepool and finds little changed. The wealthydrink at the town's &quot;top end&quot; and poorer ones at the &quot;bottomend,&quot; even though there's no hill in Hartlepool. And whileindustrial jobs are mostly gone, the culture survives.   &quot;I can still go down to the Boilermakers' Club and get twoor three ideas just listening to the conversation,&quot; says Mr.Smythe, who still draws Andy Capp daily. &quot;The mindset'sexactly the same.&quot;   In a way, so is Mr. Smythe's. When regional boosters askedhis permission to dress Andy Capp in coat and tie forpromotional cartoons, Mr. Smythe refused. And though now awealthy man, living in Hartlepool's nicest district, heabjures &quot;the wine-and-cheese crowd&quot; and still regards himselfas working class.   &quot;It's like going to another country and thinking you canescape,&quot; Mr. Smythe says. &quot;You can't. You take yourself withyou.&quot;   If there is one institution that most clearly reflects andsustains class, it is English education. Though schools havebecome more democratic in recent decades, this is still asystem that winnows a chosen few, relegating the rest toinferior status. Students begin specializing at 14 and mustclear steep, exam-oriented barriers at 16 and 18. Only one infive students makes it to a university. Working-class kids,at often overcrowded and underfunded schools, can't easilycompete with students in better districts, or at schools suchas Eton.   &quot;Because we remain a class society, we make thistremendous distinction between the sheep and the goats,between the academic and the vocational,&quot; says Sir ClausMoser, warden of Wadham College at Oxford University. &quot;We sethurdles in front of children that most know they can't jump.&quot;   At the Manor School in Hartlepool, 80% end their academicstudies at 16. Out of a class of 150, only four, on average,make it to a university.   Teachers blame the system, but also a home environmentthat puts little emphasis on learning. In a school of 750students, only 10 parents attend monthly PTA meetings.Traditionally, with apprenticeships and jobs almost assuredat 16, there was little advantage to staying in school, andthis ethos persists. &quot;The attitude is still, `God made themhigh and low, and everyone knows his place,' &quot; says Pat Bell,a Manor School teacher. &quot;When I push clever students, theirparents complain that I'm only making them big-headed.&quot;   In her morning &quot;assertiveness&quot; class, 15- and 16-year-oldsdiscuss their plans for next year. Out of 25, all but twohope to work or train at low-skilled jobs. Asked if any haveconsidered business or professional careers, Julie Kidsonguffaws.   &quot;We're looking at the real world, aren't we?&quot; says the15-year-old, who wants to be a nanny. &quot;We know we aren'tgoing to make the grade. So why not get out of school and geton with it?&quot;   As she and her classmates see it, university is reservedfor &quot;posh kids&quot; who go to the right schools, &quot;get pushed bytheir parents,&quot; and inherit &quot;the creamy part&quot; of the jobpool. &quot;They can always go work for the family firm, can'tthey?&quot; one boy says. Another, whose father is unemployed,says he'd feel guilty staying in school &quot;instead of bringinghome money.&quot;   Yet asked to fantasize that they have the grades and fundsto do anything, the students don't change the jobs they'dseek: roofer, cleaner, clerk, pipe fitter.   Jackie Middleton, a teacher at the Brierton School, saysthat at age 11 or 12, some students still dream of becomingpop or sports stars. But by 16, fantasies don't cross theirradar screen. Even so, after hearing the list ofworking-class jobs her students say they're headed for, Ms.Middleton says they're shooting too high.   &quot;For a lot of them, when they finish their training, therewon't be jobs,&quot; she says. &quot;But why pour water on theirparade?&quot;   For young Hartlepudlians who can't find work, Britain'swelfare state buffers the unemployed from the bleak povertyof American inner-cities -- and of north England just ageneration ago. The region's dark, Satanic mills are mostlygone, as are its slums, cleared for suburban-style housingprojects. All Britons have access to free medical care. Anunemployed couple with two children receives about $160 aweek, plus free rent, free school meals, free medicine, even&quot;cold weather&quot; payments if the temperature falls below 32degrees for seven days in a row. While crime rates in thenorth are Britain's highest, the streets still are crowded atnight. There were no murders in Hartlepool last year. (InYoungstown, Ohio, a U.S. industrial city of identical size,there were 59.)   &quot;There's a real sense of belonging here,&quot; says MargaretRae, a benefits counselor in Hartlepool. &quot;People have a verytight network to fall back on.&quot;   Britain's safety net, though, has a sticky underside:long-term dependency. Because of the benefits structure, anunemployed parent of two in Hartlepool must find a job payingalmost $300 a week to improve on the dole. The few jobsavailable here typically pay $150 to $250 (there is nominimum wage in Britain). The result, says Ms. Rae, &quot;is thatthere isn't much incentive to find work. When people here getoffers, we often have to show them that they're better offsaying no.&quot; In the area she covers, 50% of residents arejobless, and most have been for 15 years or more.   Other social workers say that many men trained in tradesare reluctant to take service jobs, a disdain they oftencommunicate to their sons. The Rev. William Hall, who runs acommunity center near Hartlepool, takes this gloom one stepfurther. He believes Britain must accept that many citizenswill never find employment. Instead of job counseling, hiscenter offers ways for &quot;people to fulfill their potentialoutside of paid work,&quot; such as a &quot;tool library&quot; that lendssaws and hammers for home carpentry.   Margaret Thatcher's calls in the 1980s for an &quot;enterpriseculture&quot; have had scant impact. Laborers sought opportunitieselsewhere, only to end up where they started. Danny Graham,an unemployed steelworker, was one of many northerners whodecided to &quot;go down London.&quot; He and three friends found workpulling asbestos out of hospital walls. But they couldn'tfind affordable housing. &quot;So we parked me car behind theanimal lab at the hospital and slept in it. Two in front, twoin back.&quot; They lasted three weeks.   Entrepreneurship also hasn't taken root. Only 9% ofnorthern workers are self-employed. &quot;Enterprise culture?You're looking at it,&quot; chuckles Fred Medland, gesturing at awooden cart piled with bent baby carriages, an old sink andother junk. Mr. Medland is one of Hartlepool's &quot;rag andbones&quot; men, clomping down residential streets on horse-drawncarts, yelling for people to bring out old clothes or &quot;anyscrap iron]&quot; Collecting everything from rusted tricycles todiscarded artificial legs, the rag and bones men sell theirloads at local scrap yards, which crush or bundle the goodsfor reprocessing.   Mr. Medland, whose partner wears a frayed tweed suit hesalvaged from the refuse, typically earns $5 for a morning'swork. &quot;It's enough to keep me going until tomorrow,&quot; says the64-year-old former steelworker. He sleeps near his horse, ina stable perched on a plot known as the &quot;slag banks,&quot; wherethe now-closed steelworks used to dump waste metal.   For most rag and bones men, collecting scrap is a &quot;fiddlejob&quot; -- slang for unreported work that illegally supplementsthe dole. Such jobs, which include windowwashing or paintingand decorating, are an English mainstay, just one of the manyways that low-income people have always scraped by.   In a country where wages are similar to the U.S., butprices much higher, even those &quot;in work&quot; make do with less.Most smokers in Hartlepool roll their own cigarettes, muchcheaper than paying $3.80 for a regular pack. Nationwide,barely half of those polled in a recent survey listedtelephones and TV sets as items &quot;which all adults should beable to afford.&quot; Two pairs of all-weather shoes were deemedan unnecessary luxury by 26%. One-fifth said they didn't eatin a restaurant as much as once a month.   &quot;Struggling is a way of life,&quot; says Jean Clayton, asecretary earning $167 a week at Hartlepool's nuclear plant,as she and her daughter shop at the &quot;Queen's Nearly New DressAgency.&quot; Ms. Clayton went to work when her husband lost hisjob five years ago. The family hasn't purchased furniture ornew clothes since then.   Others save by growing food. At Easington, a miningvillage of back-to-back cottages near Hartlepool, residentsrent small gardens wedged between the main shaft and therailroad. &quot;For most of us, it used to be a hobby -- you know,growing the biggest cabbage for a show prize,&quot; says DougGray, a factory worker, tilling the sooty soil. &quot;Now, it's alittle extra at dinnertime.&quot;   The Easington mine dumps a mix of stone and slag straightinto the North Sea, adding to the deposits of &quot;sea coal&quot; thatthe Dawes family and others in Hartlepool collect for aliving. The land between the low and high tide mark, andanything on it, technically belongs to the Crown.   &quot;If the queen wants it, she can come and get it,&quot; says theelder Dawes, Thomas, sloshing through the sulfur-smellingsurf, amidst the refuse of the Industrial Age: rubber belts,bolts, rivets, bits of wire. Other men scurry through thedark, staking claims by standing their shovels in the densestrivulets of coal.   Working both tides each day, Mr. Dawes can make about$5,000 a year. He pays &quot;pocket money&quot; to Paul, who is thefourth of his sons to work there. &quot;They all come back to thebeach in the end,&quot; Mr. Dawes says. &quot;It's what they know.&quot;   The Dawes family lives almost rent-free in a subsidizedbrick house, in a project known as Rogues' End because of itsrampant crime. &quot;You have to keep an eye on your laundry line,so someone doesn't pinch your clothes,&quot; says Thomas's wife,Christine, who cleans part-time at a chemical factory.   In the evening, the family gathers around the TV withtheir four children still living at home; the other threelive less than a mile away. Mark, 25, has been seacoaling onhis own, and his face and clothes are streaked with grime.   After a dinner of egg and butter sandwiches, Thomas plucksthe tide chart from the top of the TV. &quot;High water's at 10past midnight,&quot; he says. Mark nods. Paul picks at the blisteron his middle finger. At 4 a.m., after a video and a shortsnooze, they'll gather their shovels for another shift ofsea-coaling. The Dawes's youngest child, 10-year-old Andrew,asks if he can come, too.   Christine goes to clear dishes. &quot;I'd always dreamed thatone of the boys would get off the beach and make something ofhimself,&quot; she says. &quot;But if you're working class, you justcan't move up, can you?&quot;   (See related letters: &quot;Letters to the Editor: We're AllRight, Jack&quot; -- WSJ March 24, 1992)   920211-0122</TEXT></DOC>
