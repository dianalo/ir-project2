Traders, analysts and economists surveyed by Dow JonesInternational News Service say the mark will be hurt byconcerns about the cost of German unification and evidence ofworsening German inflation. Political problems in Yugoslaviaand the beleaguered Soviet economy also are expected to hurtthe mark, traders say.</LP><TEXT>   However, enough uncertainty about the economic policies ofthe Group-of-Seven industrialized nations emerged from lastweek's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers tokeep the dollar from soaring, says Judy Rubenstein, vicepresident and trader at Bank of America in Los Angeles. Theseven nations are the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, Germany,Italy and Japan.   The G-7 summit conference in London in mid-July will bewatched for any clues that the leaders are worried that thedollar is pushing too high, Ms. Rubenstein says.   Average forecasts of market watchers polled show thedollar standing at 1.8135 marks at the end of July and 1.8505marks by the end of September. The dollar is also expected tofirm against the Swiss franc, while the pound is expected tolose ground against the U.S. currency.   The yen, however, is expected to buck the trend, with thedollar firming modestly to 139.50 yen by the end of July butfalling back to 138.88 yen by the end of September.   The yen, traders say, will hold its own against the dollardespite a likely cut in Japanese interest rates during thequarter. It may even gain against the dollar if U.S. economicdata prove disappointing.   The following table shows the average prediction of thedollar's level on July 31 and Sept. 30 compared with closinglevels in New York Friday.                                                                                                           Currency      NY          -    Forecast for    -    vs. Dollar    Friday      July 30       Sept. 30                                                                                                           D-Mark          1.8110      1.8135        1.8505    Yen           137.48      139.50        138.88    Pound           1.6215      1.6091        1.5717    Swiss Fr        1.5534      1.5686        1.5986                                                                                                          In Tokyo early Monday, the dollar was trading at 138.13yen, down a bit from Friday's close of 138.15 yen. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at 1.8130 marks, up from 1.8010marks at Tokyo's close Friday.   As more evidence of German inflationary pressure appearsand capital needs for reunification mount, market talk of aGerman interest-rate rise is intensifying -- despite commentsThursday from German officials that played down the notion.   Yet even a rise in German interest rates isn't expected toinfuse the mark with much strength, observers say. Any suchmove will be offset in traders' minds by rising Germaninflation, which would leave the mark's real yield unchanged.   Dollar buying, some traders say, could take the U.S.currency as high as 1.95 marks. But they add that such adollar rise would probably be followed by profit-taking.   For one thing, traders are wary of heading too far in anydirection for fear of what the U.S. and major Europeancountries may agree to do with their interest rates. Severalcountries, including France, Italy and Britain, would like tolower rates, but are reluctant to move far out of step withthe U.S. for fear of further boosting the dollar.   Central bank intervention against the dollar also willremain a key concern. The G-7 may decide on a strategy tothwart a further rise in the dollar at the July summitmeeting. If so, central banks could become moreinterventionist in coming months, particularly if the dollarcontinues its rise, traders say.   But &quot;central banks have lost a bit of credibility&quot; thisyear, says Ms. Rubenstein of Bank of America. They haven'tbeen able to affect markets, and may not want to spend themoney to intervene.   If central banks want to lower the dollar, Ms. Rubensteinsays, they would be more likely to ride a wave started byinterbank traders than to start their own. They will probablytake advantage of market doubts about dollar strength whenthey arise, she says, but they would be reluctant to trymoving the market on their own.   Also for discussion at the G-7 is the issue of aid to theSoviet Union. Germany, which is most exposed to the Sovieteconomy, stands to suffer most from its problems. Without arescue package, the mark could come under additional strain,and the other European Monetary System currencies willconsequently be hurt, Ms. Rubenstein says.   The political strife in Yugoslavia also is pressuring themark. The threat of civil war there heightens traders' doubtsabout how much the German economy stands to benefit in thenear term from the liberalization of its Eastern Europeanneighbors.   In contrast to the firm outlook for German interest rates,Japanese rates are likely to head down, market watchers say.Japan's Finance Ministry appears to be pushing for the Bankof Japan to lower rates late in the third quarter tostimulate the Japanese economy, they add.   But traders don't expect such a move to affect the market,where a rate cut has long been anticipated. By the time itfinally occurs, it will have been widely discounted, saidKeith Edmonds, an international economist at NatWest CapitalMarkets in London.   None of the traders surveyed expect the dollar tostrengthen against the yen over the third quarter. Yet thereis a sort of &quot;panic feeling&quot; in Japan about weaknesses in thecountry's economic infrastructure that could hurt the yenearly on, says Ms. Rubenstein. In particular, problems in thebanking and real estate sectors are fueling investor worries,she says.   A further bearish factor for the yen in the near term isthe scandal surrounding the resignation of the chairmen ofNomura Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co., two ofJapan's largest securities firms, says Nigel Rendell, aninternational economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London.   However, Kaoru Kijikata, chief corporate dealer at NipponCredit Bank in Tokyo, says fresh worries spurred by a U.S.credit crunch and continued depression in real estate priceswill take the dollar lower against the Japanese currency bylate September.   Scott Greene, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank JuliusBaer andamp; Co. in New York, expects the dollar to rise againstthe Swiss franc, as Switzerland's economic fundamentals andtax-law problems continue to wear away the franc's appeal.The yen will also be favored over the former haven currency,he said.   Edmonds from NatWest Capital Markets says the pound, whilesoft against the dollar, will gain slightly against the mark.But he adds that the firmness will merely be &quot;the calm beforethe storm.&quot;   He forecasts that renewed jitters in the fourth quarterover the Conservative government's shaky hold on power willundermine the currency. Also hurting the pound will be fearsthat the government will lower rates too quickly to win thenext general election, which must be held by the middle ofnext year.
