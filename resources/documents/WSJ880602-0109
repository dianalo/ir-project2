The huge joint-venture project, for which final agreement is expected to be reached by year's end after a feasibility study, could eventually be valued at more than $20 billion, said Charles E. Hugel, president and chief executive officer of Combustion Engineering.    Combustion Engineering and McDermott will lead a consortium -- including the Japanese concerns the Mitsui group and Mitsubishi Corp. -- which will provide financing for the entire project. &quot;This will be done with debt, not equity,&quot; Mr. Hugel said. The plants will use Siberian natural gas to produce intermediate petrochemical products that eventually will be turned into various products including rubber, specialty chemicals and additives for gasoline.    Separately, Occidental Petroleum Corp. announced it also agreed to set up a petrochemical consortium to produce a range of plastic products in western Siberia. Armand Hammer, chief executive officer of the Los Angeles concern, said the group is likely to include West German and U.S. companies and also will use the abundant local gas supplies. Once it is put together, probably by September, the consortium will negotiate details of the venture. He declined to give financial details.    The two announcements, made on the last full day of the superpower summit, illustrate the increasing interest among U.S. executives to do business with the Soviet Union. Soviet officials frequently have said that the current low volume of trade between the two superpowers is abnormal and should be greatly increased. They would like Washington to drop restrictive trade legislation.    In the Combustion Engineering venture, the Soviet Ministry of Oil Refining and Petrochemical Industries will take at least a 51% stake in the venture, as stipulated by Soviet law. Mr. Hugel said he hoped the first plant would be ready in 1991 and the two complexes, in the towns of Tobolsk and Surgut, could be finished by 1996.    Combustion Engineering, based in Stamford, Conn., will engineer and design the plants, while McDermott, an energy-services concern based in New Orleans, will be in charge of construction. Some of the parts to be used, such as control equipment, are likely to be taken from an earlier joint venture Combustion Engineering established in the Soviet Union last year, the first by any U.S. company.    Mr. Hugel said he expects as much as 45% of the plants' production will be exported onto world markets, to cover the investment costs and ensure hard-currency earnings that the U.S. companies can take out of the Soviet Union as profit. Under the Soviet joint-venture law, profits can only be repatriated in hard currency if they are covered by earnings from exports. </TEXT></DOC>
