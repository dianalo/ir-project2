The move came a day after WPP, a British marketing services concern, filed suit against JWT in Delaware state court charging the advertising, public relations and market research concern with withholding private JWT information from WPP while giving it to other potential acquirers.    WPP has offered to buy JWT's about 10 million shares outstanding for $50.50 a share, or about $515 million, if JWT agrees to a friendly transaction. JWT directors are considering the WPP bid and alternatives to it, including taking the company private in a leveraged buyout.    A JWT spokesman described the information sought by WPP as &quot;literally anything they wanted to look at -- talking to executives, looking at business plans&quot; and the like.    A WPP spokesman said WPP is considering the proposal.    In a letter to Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive officer, JWT Chairman Don Johnston said WPP would be given access to the information if it consents, in a confidentiality agreement, to buy JWT shares in the next two years only under an all-cash tender offer of at least $50.50 a share and that any such offer remain open until July 24 or the expiration date of any other tender offer for JWT shares.    JWT shares closed yesterday at $52.25, off 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Mr. Johnston said that in contrast, other possible suitors have been required to sign two-year standstill agreements prohibiting them from share purchases &quot;other than pursuant to a proposal approved by our board.&quot;    WPP, which already controls about 5% of JWT shares, currently has a $45-a-share tender offer in effect that has been rejected by JWT directors as &quot;inadequate.&quot;    As reported earlier, JWT has been talking to Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and at least two other concerns interested in organizing a leveraged buyout of JWT.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
