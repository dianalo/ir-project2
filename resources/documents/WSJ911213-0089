The actively traded February contract traded aslow as $358.20 before ending at $359.90, down $8.70. Volumewas heavy, at an estimated 70,000 contracts.   After taking a beating on Wednesday, December silver fellanother 8.8 cents an ounce to end at $3.822. The activelytraded March contract fell below an important technicalsupport area at $3.90 to end at $3.863, down nine cents.January platinum fell $6.90 an ounce to $361.80.   Gold's decline was the steepest since spot gold fell$29.80 on Jan. 17, just after Operation Desert Storm began inthe Middle East, according to the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold is traded.   But yesterday there wasn't a major world event to explainthe sell-off. Commodity funds and other speculators sold ontechnical indicators, analysts and traders said. The mainone: gold's inability to rise above $375 earlier in the week.   In the background, some fundamental developments alsosupported the bearish sentiment. The calming of tensions inthe Soviet Union reduced concerns that civil unrest woulddisrupt gold and platinum sales from the area, said WilliamO'Neill, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. Inaddition, reports that Russia is centralizing gold sales in aquasi-private organization indicates sales will continue, hesaid. Discouraging economic statistics at home and weak oilprices offer investors little incentive to hold gold as ahedge against inflation, he added.   Once precious metals prices began to decline, the selling&quot;started feeding on itself and became an avalanche,&quot; said IanMacDonald, vice president of precious metals at CreditSuisse.   Platinum and silver had already been floundering, he said,because as industrial metals they are particularly vulnerableto economic slowdowns.   Also, an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterdayabout filmless digital cameras that take photographs for useon a computer contributed to silver's weakness, said JimRiley, head trader at J. Aron, a division of Goldman Sachs andamp;Co. Silver is used in film processing.   Mr. MacDonald said silver's fall below $3.90 doesn't bodewell on a technical basis. But Ralph Mizrahi, commoditytrader at Prudential Securities, says strong demand fromsilver users emerged when the price fell below $3.90.   Traders are unsure of what to expect today. Mr. Mizrahiobserved, &quot;The {gold} market works so hard to get up $10, sowhen it loses it all in one day, people get exasperated andthrow in the cards.&quot;   Don Tierney, a precious metals analyst at FortuneCommodities, said that toward the end of yesterday's sessionit appeared selling based on anticipated margin calls came inand might continue this morning. But, he said he expectsshort-covering by the end of the day as traders take profitsahead of the weekend. Traders cover short positions, or betsthe price will fall, by buying offsetting contracts.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude-oil futures prices settled higher yesterdayin choppy trading. A late attempt to take profits wasovercome by continued covering of short positions and somefresh buying. Participants said the market finally appears tohave achieved at least short-term stability after its longslide. The bullish report that initiated the rise -- rumorsof another Soviet coup -- came Wednesday. Traders with shortpositions were forced to cover as prices rose. Separately,Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer was quoted by the officialSaudi Press Agency as saying Saudi Arabia isn't flooding theworld oil market with crude. Mr. Nazer said the Saudiswouldn't produce more than what has been agreed upon. TheSaudis currently produce at 8.5 million barrels a day. Therehad been speculation in the market the Saudis were pushingprices lower to help Western economies recover fromrecession.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Problems in the disintegrating SovietUnion continue to dominate grain futures markets. Yesterdayit was the country's failure to pay $40 million in freightcosts that kept ships from unloading their grain cargo inSoviet ports and chilled futures prices at the Chicago Boardof Trade. Some traders are worried that the U.S. graincompanies will delay additional shipments because ofyesterday's delay, cutting demand for grain. The price of thewheat contract for March delivery fell 5 1/2 cents to settleat $3.7775 a bushel, and the soybean contract for Januarydelivery declined 4 1/4 cents to $5.44 a bushel.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell again. Juice for Januarydelivery ended 1.05 cents a pound lower at $1.597. CelesteGeorgakis, senior analyst at Cargill Investor Services,attributed the decline to continued selling by tradersdisappointed by the warm spell in Florida during what shouldbe the beginning of the frost season. Also, the AgricultureDepartment on Wednesday boosted its U.S. orange crop estimateby 3% to 8.45 million tons. The revision was viewed asbearish, she said, even though the department's forecast forFlorida's crop, which is used to make orange juice, remainedunchanged. Market sentiment may improve, however, because offorecasts of colder weather next week, she said. PeterLeavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services Corp.of Bedford, Mass., said there's a 50-50 chance ofbelow-freezing temperatures reaching central Florida by themiddle of the week. But he added that temperatures need tofall well into the 20s before they damage oranges, and it'stoo early to tell whether that will happen. Temperatures ofabout 30 degrees can actually benefit the crop by improvingcolor and flavor, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
