Such queues are common enough at food and clothing shopsacross the Soviet Union, but the attraction here at theInternational Employment Agency is the hope of a job in theWest and an escape from all the lines.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Ulyanin, a 26-year-old house builder with a narrowface and a big fur hat, is one of nearly 300,000 people whohave signed up during the agency's first three months ofoperation. The agency is compiling a computer data base ofSoviet workers looking for temporary employment overseas. Itsfee: 5% of a worker's salary for the first six months of thejob contract.   &quot;I don't care where they send me,&quot; says Mr. Ulyanin.&quot;Africa or wherever, hard currency is hard currency.&quot;   The International Employment Agency is one of several newconcerns serving those looking for a way out of the SovietUnion. Although many population specialists discount thealarming possibility of waves of Soviets flooding across theborder into Finland and other countries, emigration hasbecome a national obsession here.   &quot;It used to be that the attitude to those who are leavingwas: You're a traitor,&quot; says Mikhail Maisky, a 27-year-olddoctor who hopes to emigrate to the U.S. within the year.&quot;Now, people you'd never expect it of are congratulating me.&quot;   Indeed, in the past it was typically the politicaldissidents or members of oppressed ethnic and religiousminorities who thought of leaving. Today apolitical peoplefrom plumbers to physicists are dreaming of distant lands.Their reasons range from fears of worsening crime and diseaseto political disillusionment or professional frustration. Therecent military crackdown in the Baltic republics and thegovernment's increasingly hard-line tone have only added tothe sense of urgency.   The stories of would-be emigrants reflect the myriad waysin which internal stresses are tearing their country apart.   In a small room in a communal apartment, up four flightsof dusty stairs reeking of urine, three young Leningradersshare tea and &quot;blini&quot; and discuss how to get out. &quot;I've heardthat South Africa is a good place,&quot; says Vasily Orlov, a27-year-old plumber. &quot;What do you think?&quot;   Mr. Orlov never thought of leaving until two years ago,when the local government said it was going to raze hismother's village to make way for a housing development and anest of new &quot;dachas&quot; for Communist Party bigwigs. &quot;I builtand repaired our whole house on our money, and the governmentsays it's not ours,&quot; he says. &quot;How can I live with such agovernment?&quot;   His friend Arkady Vinokurov, a slim 32-year-old, says hestopped working as a butcher six months ago because &quot;therewas no meat and nothing to do, and I didn't just want tosit.&quot; To earn a living, he started trading goods on the blackmarket. &quot;It's not because of bad products or a lack ofclothes that I want to leave, because you can get aroundthat,&quot; he says. &quot;It's that this system is anti-human.&quot;   People like Mr. Orlov, a Russian national with norelatives overseas, have no immediate prospects for leaving.Thus, they are counting on the passage of a new emigrationlaw, which would codify the right of people to leave freely.The law has been on the agenda of the Soviet Parliament for ayear. It still faces some opposition, mainly from themilitary and from hard-liners.   Even without the law, Soviet emigration has risen sharplyin the past two years. In the first 11 months of 1990, some382,000 people left, compared with 235,000 the year before,most of them for Israel and Germany. Estimates of potentialemigration in the first year after the law's passage rangefrom 500,000 to seven million. But at a recent conference onEuropean migration, Vladimir Shcherbakov, the Sovietdelegate, said sociologists in his country figure that only 11/2 to two million people will take advantage of the right toleave.   Western officials say they will keep an eye on whether thebill is implemented to allow free emigration or whetherSoviet authorities interpret some of its language as givingthem a continuing right to block some would-be emigrants.   Meanwhile, the lines at favored embassies remain long. TheGermans, for example, receive more than 500 people a day, andthe waiting line for an appointment is two months. Last year,Germany issued about 145,000 visas -- a 40% increase over1989 -- almost all to ethnic Germans. At the U.S. Embassy inMoscow, people line up in the snow at 8:30 in the morning toreceive applications.   And for every anxious passport applicant, there is a newscam to make the process easier or evade the restrictions. AtPushkin Square in Moscow, a young man works the long line ofpeople waiting to get into the McDonald's restaurant. Hehawks visa applications to any of a dozen countries for theequivalent of about $2.50; good places in line at the statebank and airlines offices go for as much as $17. Fakeinvitations to the West can also be bought -- at $370 a headfor a summer invitation to Greece, or $25 for an invitationto Turkey, where people can buy sheepskin coats to sellprofitably at home.   Rumors on the would-be emigre circuit say a bribe ofanywhere from $33 to $100 will get local policemen to changethe crucial nationality entry in a passport to &quot;Jewish,&quot;which makes emigration to Israel, the U.S. or Germany easier.The price for lawyers to fix up false birth certificates toprove Jewish or German lineage has risen to more than $300from about $8 in the past year. In Kiev, a Jewish husband orwife is called a &quot;raketo nositl,&quot; or rocket carrier, becausethey can carry a Ukrainian out, often for a fee.   Some Westerners hope that by shoring up the Soviet economythey can stop the outflow of people. But desperation arisesfrom other sources, too. &quot;The economic situation is part ofit, but our life isn't so bad,&quot; says Andrei Richter, apostgraduate student who lives in a four-room apartment inKharkov with his child and wife, her parents and his brother.   Mr. Richter had toyed with the idea of moving overseas inthe past, and he had traveled to the U.S. on an academicexchange. But &quot;everything changed last summer,&quot; he says, whennewspapers reported acquired immune deficiency syndromeinfections from unclean syringes had struck a number ofchildren. &quot;We have a 3 1/2-year-old daughter,&quot; he notes, &quot;andI don't want her to die because of dirty syringes.&quot;   Disillusioned scholars feel they need broader horizons.&quot;Until a year ago, we had a euphoria, a real feeling we coulddo something in this country,&quot; says Konstantin Akinsha, anart historian. &quot;Now, the majority of us have lost theseillusions and have real questions of what we can do.&quot;   This has led to a widespread fear that the country faces aserious brain drain. Some of the most inflated Sovietpredictions of potential emigration are used to whip up panicand use it to oppose the new law. KGB Chief VladimirKryuchkov accused the West in December of trying to encouragea brain drain.   Highly trained scientists may find the transition to lifein the West relatively smooth. But for the workers lined upat the International Employment Agency, getting out may proveto be just the first tough step. In general, Soviets havealmost no exposure to foreigners or foreign ways of life.   Some of the job applicants' questions reveal how deep thisisolation can be. As an intense young driver concludes alengthy discussion at the agency and prepares to leave, heturns and says with a shy smile: &quot;There's one last thing thatI'd like your advice on. Do you think I'd do better if Ishaved off my beard?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
