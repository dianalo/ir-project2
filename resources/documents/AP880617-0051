Judge Christopher French of Old Bailey's Central Criminal Courttold Ismael Sowan on Thursday that the sentence was the very leasthe could give for his ``extremely grave offences.''   Sowan, 28, was convicted Wednesday of storing explosives, riflesand grenades in his home in the eastern port of Hull.   In announcing the sentence Thursday, the judge said, ``we werereminded ... only yesterday of the appalling use to which thesematerials can be put.'' The reference was to a bombing in NorthernIreland that killed six soldiers and wounded 10 civilians Wednesday.   Sowan was arrested last August when police were investigatingthe shooting death of an Arab cartoonist, Ali Naji Awad Al-Adhami.   Although he was arrested in Hull, Sowan's trial was held inLondon at the Old Bailey court because cases involving security andterrorism usually are tried there and because Scotland Yard hadparticipated in the investigation.   Sowan testified that the weapons found in locked suitcases inhis bathroom belonged to Abder Mustapha, a known PLO guerrillasuspected of organizing Al-Adhami's murder.   Police said that Mustapha fled to the Middle East afterAl-Adhami was shot in the head. Sowan, a university researchassistant, is not a suspect in that crime, although he was a friendand associate of Mustapha.   After his arrest, Sowan claimed to be funneling informationabout Mustapha to the Israeli secret service Mossad. Officials atthe Israeli Embassy in London confirmed that Sowan was in contactwith them, and that he had told them that he had Mustapha's weapons.   British police and intelligence agencies said they did not knowabout the spying operation and did not receive information fromMossad about the weapons cache during the investigation.   David Cocks, Sowan's defense attorney, said the Israeli factormade his client innocent.</TEXT></DOC>
