Under the bill, which passed by voice vote Monday,consumers and businesses would have &quot;the ability to `just sayno' to unsolicited telephone advertisements,&quot; said Rep.Edward Markey (D., Mass.), an author of the legislation. Buta White House spokeswoman called the bill unnecessary, sayingthe number of complaints are small and that problems can beresolved through existing procedures.</LP><TEXT>   Under the bill, the Federal Communications Commissionwould establish a national clearinghouse to keep a list ofconsumers and businesses that don't want to receive &quot;junk&quot;facsimile messages or recorded telephone solicitationsdelivered by automatic dialing machines. Advertisers wouldhave to pay a fee for the list, but the service would be freefor consumers.   The FCC would set penalties for advertisers that ignorethe list and would establish technical and proceduralstandards for fax machines and automatic dialers.   Junk-fax problems have mushroomed with the boom infacsimile machine sales. Similarly, more and more consumershave been bombarded with unsolicited pitches from automaticdialers as telemarketers cut costs by reducing their workforces. Many of the consumer complaints have been directed atcomputerized dialing machines that tie up phone lines whilethe machines deliver their messages.   Just how far the bill can go is uncertain. The SenateCommerce Committee has sent to the Senate floor a separatetelemarketing fraud bill with a provision that requires theFederal Trade Commission to regulate automatic dialers,banning those that tie up consumers' phone lines. A Houseaide suggested that differences could be ironed out by aconference committee.   Separately, the Senate Commerce Committee approved byvoice vote a measure to allow telephone companies to providea &quot;video dial tone,&quot; carrying movies and othercable-television fare over the public switched network ascommon carriers without the need to obtain a cable franchise.Although the measure appeared to be a step forward for phonecompanies, it could hurt them as they push for the ability toown the content of video programming carried over theirnetworks.   The argument is somewhat academic because the phonenetworks currently aren't capable of carrying video signals.Although the phone companies had told lawmakers that theywould speed up installation of fiber-optics networks if theywere allowed to own video programming, the potential problemof phone companies using their monopoly phone service tosubsidize competitive video services outweighed any promisedbenefits.   The video dial-tone measure was substituted for a billthat would allow independent telephone companies into thecable business with limited ownership of programming. Thevideo dial-tone bill could be added to the cable legislation,but cable and consumer groups said they believe the measurekills the telephone companies' efforts to expand into cable.   The seven regional Bell companies face an additionalhurdle: They are barred from the cable business by theconsent decree that broke up the Bell System in 1984. Theseven Baby Bells wouldn't be allowed into the business untilthe consent decree restrictions are lifted.</TEXT></DOC>
