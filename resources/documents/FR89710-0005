Introduction</ITAG>On September 22, 1988, the Commission released to Congress the resultsof an extensive investigation into the default of the Washington PublicPower Supply System (``Supply System'').\1\<NOTE/> At the same time, it published Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 26100 (``Release''),\2\<NOTE/> which requested comment on several initiatives that weredesigned to improve the quality, timing, and dissemination of disclosurein the Municipal securities markets. The Release proposed for adoptionRule 15c2-12 (``Proposed Rule'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\3\<NOTE/> (``Exchange Act''), provided an interpretation of underwriter'sresponsibilities in municipal offerings (``Interpretation''), and solicitedcomment on proposals advanced by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board(``MSRB'') and other members of the industury to create a repository formunicipal disclosure documents.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Report on the Investigationin the Matter of Transactions in Washington Public Power Supply SystemSecurities </T3>(1988) (``Supply System Report'').

Rule 15c2-12</ITAG>The Commission proposed Rule 15c2-12, in part, under its authority in section15(c) of the Exchange Act to adopt rules and regulations ``reasonably designedto prevent [] such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, ormanipulative''.\5\<NOTE/> As indicated in the Release, the Proposed Rule was designedto establish standards for the procurement and dissemination by underwritersof disclosure documents as a means of enhancing the accuracy and timelinessof disclosure to investors in municipal securities. Specific provisionsof the Proposed Rule also were intended to assist underwriters in meetingtheir responsibilities under the general antifraud provisions of the federalsecurities laws, by providing them with a mandatory opportunity to reviewthe issuer's disclosure documents before commencing sales to investors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Rule 15c2-12, although denominated under Section 15(c)of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o), also was proposed, and is herein adopted,under the Commission's authority in Sections 2, 3, 10, 15B, 17, and 23of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78b, 78c, 78j, 78o-4, 78q, and 78w.In proposing Rule 15c2-12, the Commission recognized that, as a resultof efforts by the industry to improve disclosure, most issuers in offeringsabove $1 million prepare offering documents that are available to investors.The Government Finance Officers Association (``GFOA'') Disclosure Guidelines\6\<NOTE/> state, however, that ``[i]ssuers of municipal securitiesshould, in addition to preparing official statements, take appropriatesteps to further the avilability to the public of the information therein.''Among other things, the GFOA's Disclosure Guidelines encourage the disseminationof official statements to investors ``as early as possible.'' \7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ GFOA, <T3>Disclosure Guidelines for State and Local Government Securities </T3>(January1988) (hereinafter ``GFOA Disclosure Guidelines'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See </T3>Procedural Statement No. 3, ``Availability of Official Statementsto the Public and Delivery of Official Statements to Underwriters,'' Id.at 83.In responding to the Commission's request for comments, numerous issuersconfirmed that it was their practice to produce preliminary and final officialstatements in connection with an offering of bonds. Moreover, among frequentissuers, the quality of disclosure was reported to be quite good. The PublicSecurities Association (``PSA'') noted, for example, that most of thoseresponding to its survey of current disclosure practices in the municipalmarkets \8\<NOTE/> had rated disclosure in new issues as ``satisfactory'' and``very good''.\9\<NOTE/> It pointed out that 94% of those responding to the surveyrated ``content and completeness'' of disclosure documents in new issuesas ``satisfactory'' to ``excellent''. Nevertheless, the PSA reported thatthis very positive assessment of disclosure practices dropped sharply whenthe availability of disclosure was considered. Forty-five percent of thoseresponding to its survey rated ``availability of documents (preliminaryand final) in a timely fashion'' as less than ``satisfactory''.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>Public Securities Association, Municipal Disclousure Task Force Report:Initial Analysis of Current Disclosure Practices in the Municipal SecuritiesMarket,</T3> (June 1988) (hereinafter ``PSA Task Force Report'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Letter from Austin V. Koenen, Chairman, Municipal SecuritiesDivision, PSA, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Dec. 23, 1988).The views of the PSA generally correspond to the comments received fromissuers, underwriters, and investors. While most issuers are conscientiousabout providing adequate quantities of official statements in a timelyfashion, commentators indicated that there was a range of practices. Investors,in particular, have complained about the ability to obtain disclosure documentsprepared by issuers at a time that would permit review prior to makingan investment decision.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ <T3>See e.g.,</T3> Letter from Peter J.D. Gordon, Vice President and Director,Municipal Bond Division, T. Rowe Price, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary,SEC (Dec. 27, 1988). The PSA's survey also indicates that when disclosuredocuments are prepared, they are furnished to dealers prior to settlementof the transaction only 41% of the time. Respondents to the PSA's surveyreported that official statements are furnished to underwriters and dealersafter settlement of the transaction approximately 30% of the time. <T3>PSA Task Force Report, supra</T3> note 8 at III-14, 15.In addition, there is concern among underwriters that, in light of theirresponsibilities under the general antifraud provisions of the federalsecurities laws, greater opportunity should be afforded to review the disclosureof infrequent issuers, so that any problems in the disclosure documentsmay be detected before recommendations are made to investors. One association,representing bank municipal securities dealers, commented, for example,that in some geographic areas underwriters are able to examine officialstatements a week prior to the bid date for competitive offerings, whilein other geographic areas the preliminary official statements are not available,if at all, until after the bids are due.\11\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Letter from Richard L. DeCair, Executive Director, BankCapital Markets Association, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Jan.12, 1989). Similar comments were received from individual underwriterswho stated that even when preliminary official statements are distributedto potential bidders in competitive offerings, they may not arrive in sufficienttime to permit an appropriate review. <T3>See, e.g. </T3>Letter from Susan V. Dushock, First Vice President,Municipal Bond Department, and Walter J. Peters, Vice President and AssociateGeneral Counsel, Shearson Lehman Hutton, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary,SEC (Dec. 27, 1988). The Commission believes that Rule 15c2-12 will promote greater industryprofessionalism and confidence in the integrity of the municipal marketswithout unnecessarily burdening issuers. As suggested in the Release, andreflected in the comment letters, it has generally been the view of stateand local governments that regulation intended to enhance disclosure inthe municipal markets is beneficial, so long as it does not adversely affectthe capital-raising function of responsible issuers. In determining toadopt the Rule, the Commission is sensitive to the impact that the Rulemay have on efficient financing practices developed in the municipal market.In this regard, the Commission has attempted to take into account commentators'concerns that the use of certain financing techniques, including tax-exemptcommercial paper, variable rate offerings, and multi-mode issues,\12\<NOTE/> as well as limited placements to sophisticated investors,might be unduly restricted if the Rule is adopted as proposed. Accordingly,the Commission has provided exemptions in the Rule to facilitate such offerings,which generally do not raise the concerns sought to be addressed by theRule. Although the Commission has chosen to adopt Rule 15c2-12 at thistime, it encourages a continuing dialogue with members of all segmentsof the municipal industry. The Commission has specifically provided inparagraph (d) of the Rule, discussed later, that exemptions from any ofthe provisions of the Rule may be granted, upon written request, wherethe exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protectionof investors. The exemptive provisions in paragraph (d) are designed toafford immediate flexibility to correct unforeseen burdens. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ See discussion <T3>infra </T3>at note 81 concerning variable rate demand notes and multi-modeofferings. <T3>See generally, </T3>Amdrusky, <T3>Creative State and Local Financing Techniques, </T3>in <T3>State and Local Government Financing </T3>(Gelfand ed. 1987). A. Scopeof the Rule As indicated above, Rule 15c2-12 is being promulgated under the Commission'sauthority in section 15(c) of the Exchange Act as a means reasonably designedto prevent fraud. The Rule applies only to underwriters participating in``a primary offering of municipal securities with an aggregate principalamount of $1,000,000 or more''. In addition, the Rule contains exemptionsfor underwriters participating in offerings of municipal securities inlarge denominations that are sold to no more than 35 sophisticated investors,or have short-term maturities, or have short-term tender or put features.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Thresholds </ITAG>Proposed Rule 15c2-12 would have applied to underwriters participatingin an offering of municipal securities with an aggregate offering pricein excess of $10 million. The Commission proposed an initial thresholdof $10 million in an effort to assure that any costs that the Rule mightimpose would be offset by the potential protection to the largest numberof investors. Data supplied by the PSA indicated that if the proposed thresholdwere implemented, 25% of long-term bond offerings, accounting for 86% ofthe total dollar volume of such offerings, would be subject to the ProposedRule. The Commission also requested comment on whether some alternativelevel was more appropriate, including $1 million, $5 million, $20 million,or $50 million.\13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The Commission inquired about the costs that issuersand underwriters would experience if the threshold were set at alternativeoffering amounts, and invited comment about the quality and timelinessof disclosure provided at the alternative offering amounts. In addition,the Commission requested comment on whether the threshold should be basedupon the type of issuer, maturity, or complexity of the bonds being offered.Thirty-nine commentators expressed a view on the appropriate theshold forthe Rule. The alternative suggestions ranged from no threshold to $50 million.Eight commentators generally favored a higher threshold, while 29 suggestedlower thresholds, usually at the $1 million level.\14\<NOTE/> In particular, the PSA and the MSRB strongly recommendedthat the Commission move the Rule's threshold to $1 million dollars. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Many of the commentators conditioned their support forlower thresholds on appropriate exemptions for certain types of offerings.Some commentators, including the GFOA, that supported higher thresholdsfor governmental issuers, also indicated that lower, or no thresholds,would be appropriate for conduit offerings, which they reported have shownthe greatest degree of disclosure problems. Two commentators supportedthe proposed threshold. The comment letters expressed a strong sentiment that a substantial portionof both defaults and disclosure dissemination problems in the municipalsecurities markets occurred in offerings below the proposed threshold.The Bond Investors Association, for example, noted that of the defaultsoccurring in bonds issued between 1981 and 1985, 79% of issues and 40%of the dollar amount of defaults were in issues below $10 million.\15\<NOTE/> While there is not a direct correlation between economicdefaults and the adequacy of disclosure, many of the offerings below theproposed $10 million threshold are in types of securities that presenthigher risks to investors that should be highlighted in a complete disclosuredocument. In addition, a greater portion of offerings below $10 millionare by infrequent issuers, with whom the market is unfamiliar. The PSA,along with other commentators, noted that the quality of disclosure correlatesdirectly with the size of the bond issue. Generally, the larger the bondissue, the better the disclosure.\16\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission is persuaded that the structural safeguardscontained in Rule 15c2-12 will have added significance in offerings below$10 million. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Letter from C. Richard Lehman, President, Bond InvestorsAssociation, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Nov. 22, 1988). The BondInvestors Association indicated that it selected the five year period from1981 to 1985 to avoid most of the distortion created by the Supply Systemdefault in pre-1981 statistics. The period chosen also ignores the lastthree years in which the Association indicated that defaults are a futureevent for the most part. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ The PSA's Task Force Report on municipal securities statedthat only 5% of the 264 dealers responding to its survey found that theadequacy of disclosure was below satisfactory in negotiated offerings above$50 million. In contrast, 20% of the respondents found disclosure to beless than satisfactory in negotiated offerings of $10 million or less.<T3>PSA Task Force Report, supra </T3>note 8, Table 11A. <T3>See also, </T3>Forbes andamp; McGrath, <T3>Disclosure Practices in Tax-Exempt General Obligation Bonds: An Update,</T3>7 <T3>Mun. Fin. J. </T3>207 (1986). Apart from the actual quality of disclosure in offerings below $10 million,there was also concern about the perception that a high threshold wouldcreate among investors. Specifically, some commentators conjectured that if a $10 million thresholdwere utilized, it would result in a ``tiering'' of the municipal markets.\17\<NOTE/> They indicated that investors might view all offerings belowthe $10 million threshold as lacking the same quality of disclosure asthose subject to the Rule, and may have discriminated against such offerings.Accordingly, issuers offering securities in amounts below the thresholdmay have been required to pay increased underwriting spreads compared tosecurities subject to the Rule's safeguards.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Letter from John W. Rowe, Chairman, MSRB, to JonathanG. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Nov. 8, 1988); Letter from PSA.While the Commission has determined to lower the threshold to one milliondollars, it is sensitive to concerns that the Rule not impose unnecessarycosts on municipal issuers.\18\<NOTE/> Recent studies indicate that the large majority of issuers,84% of municipal securities offerings, including both competitive and negotiatedofferings, provide official statements.\19\<NOTE/> Even with the lower threshold, many commentators, includingthe MSRB and PSA, indicated that the Rule, as adopted, will not imposeunnecessary costs or force a majority of responsible issuers to departfrom their current practices. The commentators suggested that the Ruleshould, however, encourage more effective disclosure practices among thoseissuers that do not currently provide adequate and timely information tothe market. In this connection, support for a one million dollar thresholdalso was found in the comment letters from some issuers and issuer tradeassociations.\20\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ At the one million dollar threshold, the Rule will applyto 79% of all long-term bond issues, accounting for 99% of the total dollaramount of long-term municipal offerings. Release 53 FR at 37783. In 1988,approximately $23,358 million in short-term debt (less than 13 months)was offered. At the current threshold of $1 million, 99% of the dollaramount and 71% of short-term debt issues would be subject to the Rule.Source: IDD/PSA Database.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>PSA Task Force Report, supra</T3> note 8, at 84.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Letter from Earle E.

Deaton, National Council of State Housing Agencies, to JonathanG. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Dec. 22, 1988).In addition to requesting comment on whether the proposed threshold shouldbe revised, the Commission also invited comment on whether thresholds shouldbe implemented that distinguish among different types of offerings. A numberof the commentators suggested that most of the problems in municipal disclosurehad occurred in conduit offerings. In light of the low default rate ofgeneral obligation bonds, they argued that some distinction should be madeaccording to the type of debt being offered.The GFOA, among others, recommended that governmental purpose bonds shouldalternatively be exempt from the Rule's requirements or subject to a $25million threshold.\21\<NOTE/> In contrast, an almost equal number of commentators, includingissuers,\22\<NOTE/> objected to any distinction in applying the Rule. One issuernoted, for example, ``if disclosure is good and most responsible issuersare currently complying with reasonable guidelines, no harm is done inrequiring the 9% of government issuer's [sic] who are not making adequatedisclosure (according to the PSA Survey) to comply with the proposed rule,and therefore strengthen acceptance for all of us in the market.'' \23\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Letter from Jeffrey L.

Gunyou.After reviewing the comment letters, the Commission has decided not todraw a distinction between types of offerings in the Rule. In reachingthis decision, the Commission is mindful that there is a range of creditworthinessand risk associated with both governmental and conduit bonds that may varysignificantly according to the issuer.\24\<NOTE/> Moreover, while defaults may have the most severe impacton the value of a security, investors are more likely to be affected bythe exercise of call provisions or other terms of the offering. The MSRB,in its comment letter, emphasized that as offerings have become more complex,information concerning the structure of the offering has acquired increasedsignificance to investors. Thus, notwithstanding the relatively low defaultrate enjoyed by general obligation debt, the Commission believes that itis equally important for investors to receive timely and complete informationabout terms of the offering in all types of issues.\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ One commentator noted, for example, that only the generalobligation of an issuer of meaningful size, with full governmental powers,is likely to produce a distinct level of security to investors. Similarly,a ``conduit'' bond of a reporting company may have more in common withthe general obligation debt of a major city than either does with the bondsof an irrigation district or conduit bonds for a start-up retirement facility.Moreover, a government hospital may have the identical credit risk as ahospital owned by a not-for-profit organization. Letter from Robert DeanPope, Partner, Hunton andamp; Williams, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC(Jan. 31, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Although the Proposed Rule was published for commentat the same time that the Commission released the<T3> Supply System Report</T3> to Congress, the Proposed Rule was not aimedat preventing municipal defaults. While defaults may pose the most seriouseconomic threat to investors, the Commission noted in the Release that``no amount of increased review of offering materials by municipal underwriterswill prevent municipal defaults totally.'' 53 FR at 37781. The Commissionis aware that municipal securities, particularly general obligation bonds,have enjoyed a relatively low default rate, when compared to corporateofferings. In addition, as discussed in the Release, efforts by the industryhave improved greatly the quality of disclosure provided to investors inmunicipal securities.<ITAG tagnum="28">Several commentators provided statistics on the current default ratiosfor municipal securities by type of issuer. The GFOA stated that the defaultrate, by type of issuer, was as follows: conduit securities_1.2%; governmentalobligations (Supply System default included)_0.5%; governmental obligations(Supply System default excluded)_0.1%. It compared municipal default ratesto a corporate default rate of 1.1%.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Primary Offerings</ITAG>The Commission also modified the Rule to clarify that it applies only to``primary offerings'', a term that is defined in paragraph (e)(7).\26\<NOTE/> The Commission determined to restrict the scope of the Ruleto primary offerings in response to concerns expressed by commentatorsthat broader language in the Proposed Rule may have incorporated conceptsconcerning the registration of secondary offerings of securities underthe Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'').\27\<NOTE/> While, as discussed later, the Rule will apply to certainreofferings of municipal securities conducted pursuant to the conversionof a multi-mode issue,\28\<NOTE/> the Rule does not generally apply to secondary distributions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ The term ``primary offering,'' for purposes of Rule 15c2-12,is defined in paragraph (e)(7) to mean an offering of municipal securitiesdirectly or indirectly by or on behalf of an issuer of such securities,including any remarketing of municipal securities that is accompanied bya decrease in the authorized denominations of the securities to less than$100,000 or by an increase in the maturity of such securities to more thannine months.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ See discussion <T3>infra</T3> at note 81 and accompanying text.B. Requirements of theRule<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Obtain and Review ``Near Final'' Official Statement</ITAG>The Proposed Rule would have required that underwriters receive a copyof a ``near final'' official statement before bidding for or purchasingan offering of municipal securities. The Release states that the purposeof this provision was to assure that underwriters have received and availedthemselves of an opportunity to review an official statement containing``complete'' disclosure about the issuer and the basic structure of thefinancing, before becoming obligated to purchase a large issue of securities.The Proposed Rule identified specific information that could be excludedfrom the official statement at the time that the underwriter bid for orpurchased the securities. Specifically, the ``near-final'' official statementneed not have contained information regarding the ``offering price, interestrate, selling compensation, amount of proceeds, delivery dates, other termsdepending on such factors, and the identity of the underwriter.''Paragraph (b)(1) of the Rule requires any underwriter that bids for, purchases,offers, or sells, whether as principal or as agent, municipal securitiesin a primary offering, to obtain and review an official statement thatis deemed final by the issuer, except for the omission of certain information.Thus, in a competitive offering, an underwriter will need to receive acopy of disclosure documents prepared in conjunction with the offeringby the issuer, or on its behalf, before bidding on the issuer's securities.The Commission recognizes that in most negotiated offerings the underwriterhas a much closer relationship with the issuer and generally participatesin drafting the issuer's official statement. In negotiated offerings, theRule would require the underwriter to obtain a copy of the official statement,deemed final by the issuer, prior to the earlier of the time it executesthe bond purchase agreement or the first sale of the bonds. Generally,in negotiated offerings, bonds are offered to investors immediately followingthe pricing of the securities and the bond purchase agreement is executeda few days later. Consequently, for practical purposes, the underwriterwould need to have a copy of a ``near-final'' official statement at thetime of pricing.\29\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Furthermore, an underwriter in a best efforts offeringor remarketing that meets the definition of ``primary offering'' also wouldhave to comply with the provisions of the paragraph, unless it could takeadvantage of one of the exemptions discussed below.As adopted, paragraph (b)(1) contains modifications from the Proposed Rulethat are designed to reflect the views of commentators. In response tocommentators' suggestions, the Rule specifies that any determination concerningwhether the official statement provided to underwriters should be deemedfinal for purposes of satisfying the terms of the paragraph is made bythe issure. In changing this provision from the Proposed Rule, the Commissionwas persuaded that allowing the issuer to determine whether the officialstatement would be deemed final for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) will eliminateuncertainty as to how, and in what manner, an underwriter should ascertainthat the disclosure document is ``complete'' \30\<NOTE/> prior to its review of the document.\31\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Reference to a final official statement as a completedocument has been moved to the definition of ``final official statement''and, accordingly, will be applicable only to the final disclosure documentsrequired to be contracted for under paragraph (b)(3) and disseminated topotential customers upon request under paragraph (b)(4).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Some commentators suggested that use of the term ``complete''in the Proposed Rule implied substantive disclosure obligations concerningthe offering documents. The Rule was not intended to govern the contentof the offering documents. The Commission is aware that efforts by theindustry have produced disclosure guidelines that are widely followed inthe preparation of municipal official statements. The GFOA's DisclosureGuidelines were first exposed for comment in 1975 and have been revisedon several occasions, most recently in January of 1988. In addition, theNational Federation of Municipal Analysts has recently proposed draft disclosureguidelines that would provide guidance on disclosure for 17 separate sectorsof municipal securities. The Commission believes that both of these guidelineswill assist issuers in fulfilling their current obligations under the generalantifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Moreover, these guidelines,in conjunction with the underwriter's own disclosure experience, aid theunderwriter in satisfying its own obligation to assess the accuracy andcompleteness of key representations contained in the issuer's disclosuredocuments.Although paragraph (b)(1) requires the underwriter to obtain a copy ofan official statement that is deemed final by the issuer, the Commissionrecognizes that certain information frequently is omitted from preliminaryofficial statements. As provided in the Rule, the official statement requiredby paragraph (b)(1) need not include the offering price(s), interest rate(s),selling compensation, aggregate principal amount, principal amount permaturity, delivery dates, other terms or provisions required by an issuerof such securities to be specified in a competitive bid, ratings, otherterms of the securities depending on such matters, and the identity ofthe underwriter(s). The types of information that can be omitted also hasbeen modified based on comment letters that suggested a need for greaterflexibility with respect to disclosure concerning ratings, as well as creditenhancements and other information that may be specified by the underwriterin a competitively bid offering.The GFOA's Disclosure Guidelines suggest that ``the preliminary officialstatement should be as complete and accurate as possible''.\32\<NOTE/> The absence of the information specified above should notprevent the underwriter from soliciting indications of interest, so longas material information is supplied to potential investors prior to thetime that an investment decision is made. In this regard, the Commissionwishes to emphasize that, while the Rule requires that the underwriterobtain official statements which are deemed final by the issuer, exceptfor the omission of certain information, disclosure is a dynamic processand even substantial changes to the document required by paragraph (b)(1)may be necessary to comply with the federal securities laws at the timeof sale to investors.\33\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ Procedural Statement No. 2, ``Use of Preliminary andFinal Official Statements'', <T3>GFOA Disclosure Guidelines, supra </T3>note 6 at 81.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Although the Rule does not require the highlighting ofchanges that occur between the preliminary official statement and finalofficial statement, some commentators have suggested that this practiceis desirable. Hunton andamp; Williams, for example, recommended that alterationsand amendments suggested by the winning syndicate could more easily bebrought to the attention of investors by (a) noting information in thefinal official statement not appearing in the preliminary or (b) providinga special section that makes reference to such information in the finalofficial statement (other than ordinary completion of pricing data). TheCommission believes that these practices are beneficial to investors andwould encourage their use.By requiring the underwriter to receive information concerning the offeringat the time that it will most actively be engaged in selling efforts, theRule is intended to assist the underwriter in satisfying its responsibilitiesunder the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. As emphasizedin the Interpretation, by participating in an offering, an underwritermakes an implied recommendation about the securities. This recommendationimplies that the underwriter has a reasonable basis for belief in truthfulnessand completeness of the key representations contained in the official statement.Once the underwriter has received and reviewed the official statement,it will be in a better position to assess the accuracy of the disclosureand to make informed recommendations to investors. Moreover, since theissuer is responsible for the disclosure in the final official statement,it is the ultimate beneficiary of any objective review of its disclosureprior to sale.\3\\4\<NOTE/> In this regard, it is important to note that paragraph (b)(1)of the Rule need not prevent an underwriter from bidding on an issuer'ssecurities in a competitive offering, even when it determines that disclosureproblems exist, so long as the underwriter receives assurances that thedisclosure will be corrected.\3\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ The GFOA Disclosure Guidelines recognize the importanceof objective review of the issuer's disclosure. Procedural Statement No.5, ``Assistance by Issuers to Underwriters and Investors Inquiring aboutInformation'', states;<ITAG tagnum="28">Issuers, underwriters and investors are concerned that informationin official statements prepared by issuers be accurate and sufficient inall material respects. It has become common practice for underwriters andinvestors to assist in this effort by raising questions with issuers basedon reviews of official statements and upon other information to which theunderwriters and investors have access. Generally, the questions raisedwill relate to (i) possible information voids in an official statement,(ii) possible inconsistencies within the document, or (iii) possible inconsistenciesbetween the document and other available information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>GFOA Disclosure Guidelines, supra </T3>note 6, at 86.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ <T3>See </T3>Release, 53 FR at 37790, n. 94 (discussing the need for theunderwriter to provide in the underwriting agreement for the ability tocorrect inaccurate or incomplete disclosure).The comment letters indicate that many issuers routinely provide potentialbidders with preliminary official statements that would satisfy the requirementsof paragraph (b)(1). Nevertheless, some commentators were concerned thatthe requirement in paragraph (b)(1) might conflict with certain practicesused in connection with refundings and other interest rate sensitive offerings.While the Rule requires that the underwriter have disclosure documentsbefore it bids for, purchases, offers or sells the securities, the Commissionhas changed the definition of a ``final official statement'' in paragraph(e)(3), discussed below, to reflect the fact that adequate disclosure maybe made through the use of multiple documents. A similar philosophy wouldapply to the official statement required by paragraph (b)(1). Frequentissuers, for example, may be able to meet market windows for refundingsor other types of offerings by supplying a recent official statement, togetherwith supplementary information that contains the terms of the current offeringand highlights any material changes from the previous offering materials.Nevertheless, the Commission expects that the Rule will require greaterplanning and discipline by some issuers.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Distribute Copies of Preliminary Official Statements in Non-CompetitiveOfferings</ITAG>Paragraph (b)(2) of the Rule requires that, except in competitively bidofferings, an underwiter must send a single copy of the most recent preliminaryofficial statement, no later than next business day, to any potential customer,on request. As proposed, paragraph (b)(2) would have required that theunderwriter distribute copies of any preliminary official statement thatis prepared by the issuer, to any person upon request. The purpose of therequirement is to provide potential investors with access to any preliminaryofficial statement prepared by the issuer, at a time when it may be ofuse in making their investment decision. The Release noted that preliminaryofficial statements frequently are used as selling documents to large investors,but that practices among underwriters may vary. Commentators confirmedthat the current practice of providing preliminary official statementsto investors varies from firm to firm and may depend, in great measure,upon a number of factors, including the issuer, whether the offering isconducted on a competitive or negotiated basis, and the position of theunderwriter in the syndicate.The preliminary official statement is an important disclosure document,even though in some cases the information concerning the precise termsof the offering is incomplete and must be supplemented. Despite the importanceof the disclosure provided in preliminary official statements, the Commissionhas received comment from one major institutional investor which indicatesthat when preliminary official statements are prepared, only 70% arrivein time for the investor to conduct a professional review prior to thetime of purchase.\36\<NOTE/> Moreover, potential customers who are not institutional investorsmay not have access to either a preliminary or final official statementuntil several days following the sale of the securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ Letter from T. Rowe Price.While the Commission has chosen to require that preliminary official statementsbe provided by the underwriter, upon request, it has narrowed the originalproposal in several respects. As adopted, the Rule requires an underwriterin a negotiated offering to send a single copy of the most recent preliminaryofficial statement to any ``potential customer'' who requests a copy. Disseminationof preliminary official statements is beneficial for both issuers and investors.Nevertheless, paragraph (b)(2) does not require that issuers prepare apreliminary official statement for delivery to investors. If a preliminaryofficial statement is produced, however, and any potential customer requestsa copy, the underwriter would be required to send it by first class mailor another equally prompt means.In response to concerns expressed in the comment letters that the originalproposal would have placed unnecessary costs on underwriters, the Commissiondecided to limit the scope of persons to whom underwriters would be requiredto provide copies of the preliminary official statement to potential customers.In many cases, however, the commenters noted that it was their practice,as a matter of course, to honor such requests. The Commission believesthat a decision about whether to provide copies of such documents to personsother than potential customers \37\<NOTE/> should be left to the business judgment of the underwriter.\38\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ At the suggestion of the PSA, and others, the term ``potentialcustomer'' is defined in paragraph (e)(4) to mean a person contacted bythe participating underwriter concerning the purchase of municipal securitiesthat are intended to be offered or have been sold in the offering; anyperson who has expressed an interest in purchasing such securities; andany person who has a customer account with the participating underwriter.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Copies of preliminary official statements also frequentlyare available to anyone, upon request, from the issuer.The Commission also is modifying the Proposed Rule to except underwriterswho participate in competitively bid offerings from the requirements ofparagraph (b)(2). Many commentators suggested that the Proposed Rule wouldhave forced underwriters bidding competitively on offerings to incur thecost of reproducing preliminary official statements at a point in the sellingprocess when they may have had only limited access to copies of the preliminaryofficial statement and could not be assured of winning the competition.Moreover, underwriters were concerned about distributing preliminary officialstatements that they had no role in preparing and had not had a full opportunityto review. By limiting application of the paragraph to negotiated offerings,the underwriter only will have to provide copies of the preliminary officialstatement in those offerings in which it has had the opportunity to participatein the preparation of the disclosure document and will have the directability to recover any expenses incurred in providing copies of preliminaryofficial statements through sales of the issuer's securities.As stated in the Rule, the underwriter's obligation under paragraph (b)(2)arises ``from the time that * * * [it] has reached an understanding withan issuer that it will become an underwriter until a final official statementis available.'' Generally, the underwriter's formal contractural obligationto purchase the bonds will arise following pricing, at the time that itsigns the bond purchase agreement. Notwithstanding the fact that the underwriterhas not signed a document agreeing to purchase the bonds in a negotiatedoffering, its obligation under the Rule would begin at the time it hasreached an understanding with the issuer that it will offer the bonds,either directly, or by agreeing to join a syndicate.\39\<NOTE/> In many cases, this would mean that the managing underwriter'sobligation to provide copies of preliminary official statements will commenceat the point that it is chosen by the issuer pursuant to the request forproposal process. Once the underwriter's obligation is incurred, the Rulerequires that the underwriter continue to provide copies of the most recentpreliminary official statement, upon request, until the final officialstatement becomes available.\40\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ <T3>Cf.</T3> Rule 10b-6(c)(2)(ii) (17 CFR 240.10b-6(c)(2)(ii)) (defininga ``prospective underwriter'' to include one ``who has reached an understanding,with the issuer or other person on whose behalf a distribution is to bemade, that he will become an underwriter, whether or not the terms andconditions of the underwriting have been agreed upon'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ If a broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer reachesan initial understanding that it will offer an issuer's securities, andlater, for example, at pricing, determines not to act as an underwriter,its obligations under paragraph (b)(2) would cease. The Proposed Rule contained no definition of ``preliminary official statement,''although it suggested that a preliminary official statement was a document``prepared by the issuer for dissemination to potential bidders or purchasers.''Commentators expressed confusion about the relationship between a ``preliminaryofficial statement'' and the official statement required to be reviewedby underwriters pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of the Rule. The Rule nowcontains a definition of a preliminary official statement in paragraph(e)(6). The definition of preliminary official statement contains no descriptionof the disclosure content of the document. Instead, the term preliminaryofficial statement is defined only be reference to the issuer's intentionthat it be distributed to potential customers. Thus, a document (or setof documents) utilized to comply with paragraph (b)(1) need not be disseminatedpursuant to paragraph (b)(2), unless the document also is intended to be,or has been, disseminated to any potential customer.\41\<NOTE/> This definition is consistent with the purpose of paragraph(b)(2), the only paragraph in which the term is used, in that paragraph(b)(2) is designed to assure access by all potential customers to informationprepared by issuers for dissemination to prospective investors.\42\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ The Commission does not expect that an underwriter whodetermines that the preliminary official statement is inaccurate or containsmisleading omissions regarding the issuer, would provide copies to potentialcustomers, upon request, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Whether a document identified by an issuer as a preliminaryofficial statement meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) depends onwhether it is deemed final by an issuer, except for the information specificallypermitted to be omitted by that paragraph. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Receive Copies of Final Official Statements</ITAG>Paragraph (b)(3) of the Rule requires that an underwriter contract withthe issuer, or its agents, to receive sufficient quantities of the finalstatement to provide them to potential customers upon request and to complywith any rules of the MSRB. The purpose of the provision is to facilitatethe prompt distribution of disclosure documents so that investors willhave a reference document to guard against misrepresentations that mayoccur in the selling process. In addition, the paragraph, in conjunctionwith paragraph (b)(4), will assure that both investors and dealers in thesecondary market have greater access to information regarding the termsof the securities. As noted earlier, while the quality of disclosure has improved greatlyin the municipal markets, the PSA Task Force Report reveals that significantproblems exist in the distribution of disclosure documents. Currently,the MSRB's rule G-32 requires that, if an official statement is prepared,an underwriter participating in a primary offering of municipal securitiesmust make the official statement available to investors ``promptly afterthe date of sale of the issue but no later than two business days beforethe date all securities are delivered by the syndicate manager to the syndicatemembers.'' In addition, the GFOA's Disclosure Guidelines note that ``itis important for the official statement to be made available at such timeand in such quantity as will permit the official statement to be mailedexpeditiously by the underwriters in time for receipt by investors at orprior to settlement.'' \43\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ Procedural Statement No. 3, ``Availability of OfficialStatements to the Public and Delivery of Official Statements to Underwriters'',<T3>GFOA Disclosure Guidelines, supra </T3>note 6, at 83.Notwithstanding underwriters' current obligations under the MSRB's rules,the MSRB stated its concern that the task of distributing official statementsoften is relegated to a low priority by underwriters. By adopting paragraph(b)(3), which serves as a foundation for fostering compliance with therequirements of MSRB rule G-32, the Commission wishes to emphasize theimportance it places on the prompt distribution of final official statements.Under pararaph (b)(3), the underwriter would be required to contract withthe issuer or its agents to receive copies of the final official statementwithin the time periods mandated by the Rule. Generally, issuers will statein notices of sale for competitive offerings that the successful bidderwill be provided with a ``reasonable number'' of final official statements.Before bidding on a competitive offering, or as a condition to bidding,the underwriter would need to determine that it can comply with the termsof the Rule. Because the bond purchase agreement in a negotiated offering typicallyis not signed until a late point in the offering process, the underwriterwould need to be sure that contractural terms meeting the requirementsof paragraph (b)(3) are separately negotiated or are otherwise a clearcondition to its participation in the offering. Either the issuer or itsagent may be the party contractually bound to provide the underwriter sufficientcopies of the final official statement. In syndicated offerings, membersof the syndicate would need to assure themselves that provision has beenmade by the managers to comply with the terms of the Rule and may requiresuch an undertaking in the agreement among underwriters. Generally, the underwriter's responsibility would be satisfied under paragraph(b)(3) if it has arranged for sufficient quantity of the final officialstatement to be made available from either the issuer or a financial printerwithin the time periods stated in the Rule. While the Rule does not providerigid quantitative standards for the minimum number of official statementsthat would be required, the underwriter would need to obtain copies sufficientto comply with paragraph (b)(4) of the Rule and to satisfy MSRB rule G-32or any other rules adopted by the MSRB. Under current MSRB rule G-32, therefore,the underwriter would have to provide each investor a copy of the finalofficial statement no later than settlement. Also, as discussed below,paragraph (b)(4) generally requires that the underwriter provide copiesof the final official statement, upon request, to any potential customerfor a period of at least 25 days, and up to 90 days following the end ofthe underwriting period. Any contract with the issuer or its agents would have to provide that copiesof the final official statement will be delivered, at the latest, withinseven business days following the bond purchase agreement, and in sufficienttime to accompany or precede any confirmation requesting payment (``moneyconfirmation'').\44\<NOTE/> Apart from requiring that the underwriter contract to obtaincopies of the final official statements within a reasonable period of time,the Commission has chosen to leave the determination of the precise methodand timing of delivery to the MSRB. Moreover, if the MSRB determines thatspecific recordkeeping requirements are necessary to assure compliancewith this or other provisions of the Rule, it would be able to use itsauthority under section 15B(b)(2)(G) of the Exchange Act to adopt suchrules. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ The Commission is aware that in many cases underwritersprovide interim confirmations to investors, notifying them of the preciseamount of municipal securities purchased and the terms of the purchase.This interim confirmation is followed later by a money confirmation requestingpayment for the bonds purchased. The Rule requires only that the underwritercontract to receive copies of the final official statement prior to thetime that money confimations are sent to customers. (a) <T3>Definition of ``issuer''.</T3> In addition to comments on the mechanicalrequirements of paragraph (b)(3) of the Rule, the Commission received numerouscomments on the content of disclosure required in a final official statementand the persons who would be considered ``issuer(s)'' for purposes of theRule. The term ``issuer of municipal securities'' is used in the Rule toidentify the person from whom disclosure documents must be received, forpurposes of paragraph (b)(1), and with whom the underwriter must contractto obtain disclosure documents, for purposes of paragraph (b)(3). In responseto commentators' concerns that the Proposed Rule did not properly distinguishbetween governmental issuers and the private borrower in conduit offerings,the Commission has specifically defined the term ``issuer of municipalsecurities'' in paragraph (e)(4). Commentators had argued that, among otherthings, the conduit borrower is the economic beneficiary of the transactionand that review of information by the underwriter for purposes of paragraph(b) of this Rule should be focused on the conduit borrower. In light ofthese comments,\45\<NOTE/> the Commission has determined to clarify the Rule by definingthe term ``issuer of municipal securities'' to account for the multiplecredit sources that may be considered issuers for purposes of the Rule.\46\<NOTE/> As defined, the term encompasses both the governmental issuerspecified in section 3(a)(29) of the Exchange Act,\47\<NOTE/> as well as the issuer of any separate security, includinga separate security as identified in Rule 240.3b-5(a) of the Exchange Act.\48\<NOTE/> Accordingly, underwriters would be free to contract withany issuer, or its agent, that is in a position to supply the documentsrequired by paragraph (b)(3) of the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ Apart from the mechanical requirements of the Rule, theCommission notes that the actual disclosure responsibilities of the partiesunder the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws willdepend on the facts and circumstances in each case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ Under the definition in paragraph (e)(3), the issuerof a letter of credit would also be considered an issuer of the securitiesfor purposes of this Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(29).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ 17 CFR 240.3b-5(a).(b) <T3>Definition of ``final official statement''.</T3> The term ``final officialstatement'', which is used in both paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4), is definedin paragraph (e)(3) to mean a document or set of documents prepared byan issuer of municipal securities, or its agents, setting forth, amongother matters, information concerning the issuer of the municipal securitiesand the proposed issue of securities, that is complete on the date of deliveryto the Participating Underwriter. As adopted, the term ``final officialstatement'' contains several modifications from the Proposed Rule thatare designed to reflect the views of commentators.The term ``complete'' is used to indicate that the final official statementshould not be in preliminary form or intended by the issuer to be subjectto amendment after its delivery to the underwriters, except to take accountof subsequent events or to correct any errors that are discovered. Also,in response to suggestions from the American Bar Association,\49\<NOTE/> and other commentators, the date as of which the officialstatement must be complete has been changed from the time of the agreementto purchase the securities, to the time at which the final official statementis to be delivered to the underwriters. This avoids the problem that mightotherwise arise if events occur between the time of agreement to purchasethe securities and the date on which the final official statement is madeavailable to underwriters for dissemination pursuant to this Rule and therules of the MSRB.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ Letter from James H. Cheek, Chairman, Committee on FederalRegulation of Securities, and Robert S. Amdursky, Chairman, Subcommitteeon Municipal and Governmental Obligations, American Bar Association, toJonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Jan. 26, 1989).Another modification to the definition of final official statement in theProposed Rule relates to the use of multiple documents. In the ProposedRule, the term final official statement referred to a single document thathas generally been viewed by the industry as the final official statement.As noted in the Release, the Commission is aware that in competitive offeringsa preliminary official statement may be circulated to potential bidderswhich omits the information described in paragraph (b)(1). In some cases,the issuer will prepare a final official statement containing all the termsof the offering, while in other cases, pricing, underwriting, and otherinformation is appended to the preliminary official statement, which isthen regarded by the issuer as its final official statement.The revised definition of a final official statement specifically recognizesthat the issuer's final official statement may be comprised of one or moredocuments, ``not necessarily bound together in a single booklet.'' \50\<NOTE/> Thus, in the context of competitive offerings described above,the term would encompass a preliminary official statement coupled withpricing information. In addition, the term ``final official statement''would incorporate a group of documents, containing disclosure about theoffering, that collectively present an accurate description of its terms.Some commentators maintained that if an issuer had prepared a completedisclosure document for a recent offering, underwriters should be permittedto use that document, together with supplemental information updating thedisclosure and describing the terms of the current offering, to satisfythe requirements of the Rule. It was suggested that this procedure maybe appropriate in the context of certain ``wire deals'' and short-termofferings.\51\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ <T3>See</T3> Letter from the American Bar Association.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ As defined in paragraph (e)(3), these documents wouldconstitute a final official statement when combined. In order to meet therequirements of paragraph (b)(3), however, it would be necessary for theunderwriter to contract with the issuer for a sufficient quantity of thecombined documents for dissemination to investors.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Provide Copies of Final Official Statements to Potential Customers</ITAG>As adopted, paragraph (b)(4) of the Rule requires that underwriters providecopies of any final official statement to any potential customer, on request.Once it receives a request for a copy of the final official statement,the underwriter must send the copy no later than the next business day,by first class mail or another equally prompt means. The requirements inthis paragraph of the Rule differ from the Proposed Rule in two limitedrespects.  First, there no longer is a requirement that copies of the final officialstatement be provided to ``any person.'' Many of the commentators suggestedthat this requirement was too broad, and would have placed an unnecessaryburden on the underwriter. Accordingly, the Commission has limited theobligation of underwriters so that, consistent with paragraph (b)(2), theyneed respond only to requests for copies from potential customers.\52\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ As pointed out earlier, underwriters commenting on theProposed Rule informed the Commission that in many cases they routinelyrespond to requests for copies of documents, regardless of the source ofthe request. In addition, copies of final official statements are generallymaintained by the issuer. For example, Procedural Statement No. 3 of theGFOA's Disclosure Guidelines, ``Availability of Official Statements tothe Public and Delivery of Official Statements to Underwriters'', states``all parties other than underwriters who contact the issuer should receive,without charge, at least one copy of the official statement.'' <T3>GFOA Disclosure Guidelines, supra </T3>note 6 at 83. A second modification is the addition of specific time periods during whichthe underwriter must supply copies of the final official statement. TheProposed Rule would have required underwriters to supply copies of thefinal official statement, on request, for an indefinite period. Many ofthe commentators indicated that this requirement would have placed an unreasonableburden on underwriters and suggested that the Commission limit the deliveryperiod. Suggestions for the termination of the delivery obligation rangedfrom completion of the offering to the maturity or redemption of the bonds.If a municipal disclosure repository were created, commentators arguedthat the underwriters' obligation to distribute copies of the final officialstatement should terminate at the time the documents were available fromthe repository. After reviewing the comment letters, the Commission has decided to limitthe underwriter's delivery obligation to a period commencing with the availabilityof the final official statement and terminating at a maximum of 90 daysfollowing the ``end of the underwriting period,'' a term that is definedin paragraph (e)(2) of the Rules.\53\<NOTE/> Moreover, while the underwriter must supply copies of thefinal official statement to potential customers on request for a periodof at least 25 days following the end of the underwriting period,\54\<NOTE/> its obligation under paragraph (b)(4) will terminate afterthe 25-day period, if the final official statement is made available toany person from a nationally recognized municipal securities informationrepository (``NRMSIR'').\55\<NOTE/> If the final official statement is not available from a NRMSIR,the underwriter's obligation to deliver copies of the final official statements,upon request, would continue for the full 90-day period.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ The term ``and of the underwriting period'' differs fromsimilar terms utilized in MSRB rules G-11 and G-32. As used in paragraph(b)(4) of the Rule, the term identifies the period from which the underwriter'sobligation to provide final official statements to potential customersis measured. For issues that are sold prior to settlement with the issuer,the settlement date (i.e. the date the issuer delivers the securities tothe underwriter) would be the ``end of the underwriting period''. For securitiesthat are not sold by settlement, the underwriting period is defined toend when the underwriter sells its unsold balance of securities. The definitionrecognizes that generally in municipal securities offerings, until thesyndicate breaks, each underwriter is considered responsible for a portionof the unsold syndicate balance. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ During the underwriting period, the underwriter mustremain sensitive to developments that impact the accuracy and completenessof the key representations contained in the final official statement. Ifthere are material changes, the final official statement should be amendedor ``stickered'' to provide complete and accurate disclosure.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ The elements the Commission would consider in determiningwhether a particular entity is a NRMSIR are discussed in <T3>infra</T3> note 65. (a) <T3>Nationally Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repository.</T3>In the Release, the Commission solicited comment on the creation ofa central repository for municipal disclosure documents.\56\<NOTE/> Of the more than 60 comment letters the Commission received,45 commentators expressed a view on the concept of a central repository.Forty commentators supported some form of a central repository.\57\<NOTE/> The primary reason given for supporting the creation of oneor more central repositories was the need to have a readily accessiblecentral source of information on municipal bonds. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ The concept of a central repository for municipal officialstatements has been discussed by the industry for a number of years andwas specifically presented to the Commission in a proposal by the MSRB.<T3>See</T3> Letter from James B.G. Hearty, Chairman, MSRB, to David S.Ruder, Chairman, SEC (Dec. 17, 1987). As initially envisioned by the MSRB,participation in the repository by municipal issuers would have been mandatoryand information concerning new issues would have been made available ofinterested persons for a fee. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ The Commission received comments from a broad spectrumof entities on this issue. As indicated earlier, a detailed descriptionof the comments is included in the comment summary, which is availablein the Commission's Public File No. S7-20-88.  Even among the 40 commentators that supported the development of a centralrepository, there was a substantial difference of opinion on how it shouldbe implemented, what documents should be filed, and who should file them.A number of commentators argued that competing private organizations thatmeet government-imposed standards offer a better approach than a singlegovernmental or quasi-governmental service.\58\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Letter from J. Kevin Kenny, Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, J.J. Kenny Co., Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Dec.27, 1988).The Commission strongly supports the development of one or more centralrepositories for municipal disclosure documents.\59\<NOTE/> The use of such repositories will substantially increasethe availability of information on municipal issues and enhance the efficiencyof the secondary trading market. In this regard, the Commission welcomesthe recent announcement of the MSRB \60\<NOTE/> that it is prepared to establish and manage a central repositorythat would be funded both by the MSRB and user fees, and would providefor the collection and dissemination of official statements and refundingdocuments.\61\<NOTE/> The Commission understands that in conjunction with the adoptionof Rule 15c2-12, the MSRB intends to propose an amendment to its rule G-32,that would require underwriters to submit copies of final official statementsto the repository. Once the documents are received from the underwriter,the MSRB has indicated that the repository will function like a publiclibrary that stores and keeps an index of its documents. Private vendorswill be encouraged to utilize the MSRB's repository as a means of collectingdocuments for dissemination, in complete or summary form, to their customers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ The Commission notes that the creation of multiple repositoriesshould be accompanied by the development of an information linkage amongthese repositories. The advent of a linked repository system would affordthe widest retrieval and dissemination of information to the secondarymarkets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ Letter from John W. Rowe, Chairman, MSRB, to JonathanG. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 1, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ Under section 15B(b)(2)(J) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78o-4(b)(2)(J), any fees charged by the MSRB must be reasonable.Although the Commission supports the MSRB's recent initiative, it recognizesthe benefits that may accrue from the creation of competing private repositories.\62\<NOTE/> The Commission, therefore, views positively the recent statementsby disclosure services indicating their intention to acquire informationfrom the MSRB's repository, once created.\63\<NOTE/> Regardless of whether private vendors choose to utilize theservices of the MSRB's proposed repository, or to gather information independently,the creation of central sources for municipal offering documents is animportant first step that may eventually encourage widespread use of repositoriesto disseminate annual reports and other current information about issuersto the secondary markets.\64\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ For example, the Bond Buyer maintains a repository formunicipal securities information under the name ``Munifiche.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>See e.g., </T3>Letter from J. Kevin Kenny, Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, J.J. Kenny Co., Inc. to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June6, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ The Commission notes that the GFOA Disclosure Guidelinescurrently state: ``Submission of documents to a public or private centralrepository may be used as one part of accomplishing the purposes of disseminatingand preserving official statements, annual reports, information statements,releases, and escrow arrangements. [. . .] Issuers are strongly urged tosend, promptly upon availability, a copy of each document to a repository.''Procedural Statement No. 8, ``Dissemination of Information and ProvidingStatements, Reports, and Releases to a Central Repository,'' <T3>GFOA Disclosure Guidelines, supra </T3>note 6, at 91.The Commission believes that paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 15c2-12 providesan important incentive to underwriters that will further encourage thedevelopment of one or more central repositories. By submitting copies offinal official statements to any NRMSIR,\65\<NOTE/> the underwriter avoids the responsibility to deliver, uponrequest, copies of final official statements to any potential customerfor the full 90 day period specified in the Rule. In this regard, the provisionsof paragraph (b)(4) are consistent with the views of a significant numberof commentators who suggested that an underwriter's responsibility to distributecopies of the final official statement should terminate upon deposit ofthe documents in a central repository. At the same time, the Commissionbelieves that investors will benefit by having access to information directlyfrom underwriters during the twenty-five days after the end of the underwritingperiod, when the issuer's securities are most likely to be traded actively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ In determining whether a particular entity is a NRMSIR,the Commission will look, among other things, at whether the repository:(1) is national in scope; (2) maintains current, accurate information aboutmunicipal offerings in the form of official statements; (3) has effectiveretrieval and dissemination systems; (4) places no limits on the issuersfrom which it will accept official statements or related information; (5)provides access to the documents deposited with it to anyone willing andable to pay the applicable fees; and (6) charges reasonable fees.C. Exemptions.In addition to inviting comments about the specific provisions of the ProposedRule, the Release noted that there may be a range of credit risks and disclosureconcerns that vary according to the type of municipal bonds being offered,the presence of unusual or complex financing techniques, and the maturityof the securities. Moreover, the Release recognized that many offeringsof municipal securities are conducted in a manner that is akin to a ``privateplacement.'' In light of this practice, the Commission requested the viewsof commentators on whether exemptions from the Rule should be created for,among other things, offerings made to a limited number of sophisticatedinvestors or offerings of securities with short maturities.While the Rule is designated to emphasize the implemenation of responsibledisclosure practices, it is not intended to restrict access to the capitalmarkets by any issuer. Many of the commentators stated that, as a generalmatter, the Proposed rule would not have affected significantly the mannerin which they conduct offerings currently. There were, however, suggestionsthat some provisions of the Proposed Rule should be modified, or exemptionscreated, in order to accommodate certain offerings where application ofthe Proposed Rule would have created unnecessary hardships.The National Association of Bond Lawyers (``NABL''), along with others,commented that if the Rule were adopted as proposed, it may have impededthe use of certain efficient market practices. \66\<NOTE/> The exemptions contained in the Rule are designed to facilitatecertain of those offerings where the Commission believes that, given thesophistication of the investors and the alternative mechanisms developedby the industry to facilitate disclosure in connection with such offerings,\67\<NOTE/> the specific requirements of the Rule are not necessary toprevent fraud and encourage the dissemination of disclosure into the secondarymarket.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ Letter from Paul S. Maco, Chairman, Special Committeeon Securities Law and Disclosure, NABL, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary,SEC (Jan 31, 1989). Specifically, NABL noted that the Proposed Rule mayhave effectively eliminated: (1) tax-exempt commercial paper programs;(2) flexible mode and variable rate issues; (3) municipal short-term noteissues used as cash management techniques; (4) competitive bid local issueswhose only purchases are local banks and institutions, where bidding practiceis mandated by statute; (5) underwritten sales limited to sophisticatedinvestors and privately placed issues where purchasers conduct their owncredit investigation; and (6) ``subject to delivery of paper deals'' or``wire deals,'' where an advantageous rate may be achieved if satisfactorydisclosure and other documents are delivered prior to closing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ For example, the Commission notes that issues of tax-exemptcommerical paper generally prepare a commerical paper memorandum, containingdisclosure about the issuer, that is then used in subsequent roll-overs.A ``10b-5 certificate'' is usually obtained from the issuer's chief financialofficer on each roll-over date to assure the accuracy of the the issuer'sdisclosure. Similarly, commentators indicated that in traditional municipalprivate placements, many investors condition their purchases upon receiptof a placement memorandum containing complete disclosure about the securitiesbeing sold.After reviewing the comment letter, the Commission has determined to provideexemptions from the Rule for offerings of municipal securities in authorizeddenominations of $100,000, (1) that are sold in ``limited placements,''(2) that have maturities of less than nine months, or (3) that containprovisions that allow the investor to redeem or sell to the issuer or itsagent the securities at least as frequently as every nine months. In addition,the Rule would permit the Commission to grant exemptions that are consistentwith the public interest and the protection of investors. The Commissionwishes to emphasize that underwriters participating in offerings that areable to utilize an exemption from the Rule, nevertheless remain subjectto the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\68\<NOTE/> Moreover, any participating underwriter in a remarketingof securities initially offered in reliance upon the exemptions containedin paragraph (c)(3), when the remarketing is a primary offering as thatterm is defined in paragraph (e)(7), would be subject to the Rule, unlessthat primary offering qualified for exemptions under paragraph (c)(1) or(c)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ Underwriters also must be aware that separate MSRB provisionsmay be applicable, as well as state securities laws. For example, evenwhere the provisions of the Rule are not applicable, the MSRB may requiredissemination of final official statements, if they are prepared by theissuer. <T3>See, e.q., Disclosure Requirements for New Issue Securties: Rule G-31,MSRB Reports, </T3>(Sept. 1986) at 17 (indicating that rule G-32 appliesto both private and public offerings).A condition of each of the exemptions discussed below is the requirementthat the municipal securities be offered in authorized denominations of$100,000 or more. In choosing the $100,000 minimum denomination, the Commissionwas persuaded by the comments of NABL and others that, in this context,minimum denominations on the securities would not unnecessarily interferewith the ability of underwriters to sell securities to sophisticated investorsin situations where the investors currently obtain adequate information.\69\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ NABL suggested that use of a $100,000 minimum denominationwould assure that only sophisticated purchasers are sold bonds in offeringsnot subject to the Rule and would have the benefit of: (1) not interferingwith cost-savings financing programs using commerical paper, variable ratedemand notes, multimode securities and cash flow borrowings: (2) not requrieelaborate development of concepts such as accredited investor, safe harbor,restricted resale, etc.; (3) not adversely affect the institutional market,where investors are often loath to purchase (or are prohibited from purchasing)restricted or legended securities; (4) set the focus of the exemption onthe type of investors to be protected, not on the type or volume the issue(thus avoiding a complicated scheme of districtions among issuer type);(5) be applied easily in both the initial issueance and secondary marketcontext; and (6) preserve existing avenues of funding for municipal issuers,without imposing unnecessary costs.The term ``authorized denomination of $100,000 or more'' is defined inparagraph (e)(1) of the Rule. The definition recognizes that municipalsecurities currently are issued in registered form and that instructionsto the transfer agent are necessary to assure that securities sold in denominationsof $100,000 are not resold in smaller amounts. At the suggestion of thecommentators, the definition also is tailored to address the offering ofsecurities with original issue discount, such as zero coupon securities,by making the reference to the purchase price, rather than the principalamount of the securtities.\70\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ For zero coupon and deep discount securities, the termauthorized denomination is defined in paragraph (e)(1) based on the marketvalue of the security.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Limited Placements </ITAG>The Release requested comment on whether the Rule should contain some typeof ``private placement'' exemption.\7\\1\<NOTE/> The Release noted that the primary intent of the ProposedRule was to focus on those offerings that involve the general public andare likely to be actively traded in the secondary market. The absence ofa limited placement exemption in the Proposed Rule reflected the Commission'sconcern that, without transfer restrictions, municipal securities initiallysold on a limited basis to sophisticated investors could be resold to numeroussecondary market investors, who lacked the sophistication of the initialpurchasers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\1\ In 1988, approximately $2,716 million in municipalprivate placements were reported, amounting to 2.3% of total long-termbond offerings. These figures, however, are considered to underestimatethe actual issuance of municipal securities through private placements.Source: IDD/PSA Database. Comment was requested on whether, and in what manner, the Rule should distinguishbetween offerings sold to a limited number of investors and those involvingbroader sales and related efforts. The Commission inquired whether theRule should contain an exemption for offerings sold to no more than 10,25, 35 or 50 investors, and whether the exemption should look at the institutionalnature or sophistication of the investors. To avoid having securities thatare sold to sophisticated investors pursuant to a limited placement exemptionimmediately be resold in the retail market, the Commission inquired aboutwhether the underwriter should be required to assure that initial investorspurchase with investment intent, or whether holding periods or transferrestrictions should be required. Commentators discussing the issue almost unanimously favored an exemptionfrom the requirements of the Rule for offerings that are similar to traditionalmunicipal private placements. Nevertheless, there were a variety of opinionsgiven on how the exemption should be structured. Among other things, commentatorsdrew analogies to concepts developed under the Securities Act, includingproposed Rule 144A.\7\\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\2\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Act Release No. 6806 (October 21, 1988) 53 FR 44016(proposing Rule 144A). As some of the commentators noted, the federal securities laws have traditionallydistinguished between sales of securities to the general public and limitedofferings made to sophisticated investors. In general, offerings of securitiesto sophisticated investors are not required to comply with the more formaldisclosure regimen applicable to registered offerings, because of the investors'perceived ability to ``fend for themselves'' by demanding the disclosurenecessary to make an informed investment decision, and by having such knowledgeand experience to be capable of evaluating the merits of the prospectiveinvestment. Based in part on similar reasoning, the Commission has determinedto incorporate a conditional exemption in the Rule for offerings of securitiesthat are sold to a limited number of sophisticated investors in denominationsof $100,000 or more. Paragraph (c)(1) provides an exemption from the Rule for offerings soldto no more than 35 investors, each of whom the underwriter reasonably believesis not purchasing for more than one account and has such knowledge andexperience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluatingthe merits and risks of the prospective investment. As discussed above,the Commission was concerned that any securities offered pursuant to alimited placement exemption could immediately be resold to public investorswithout the benefit of the Rule's requirements. Accordingly, the Commissionrequested comment on whether, in conjunction with a limited offering exemption,any specific terms or restrictions, such as minimum holding periods, shouldbe imposed on securities offered in reliance on the exemption. A numberof commentators, including the PSA and NASACT, suggested that some limitationson resales may be appropriate. Commentators also indicated that currentpractice in many municipal private placements is to require letters ofinvestment intent.\7\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\3\ <T3>See also,</T3> Procedural Statement No. 6, ``Practices in Note andBond Sales; Private Placements'' <T3>GFOA Disclosure Guidelines, supra</T3> note 6, at 88 (indicating thatthe issuer should receive assurances that the transaction is in fact adirect placement).The Commission is aware that restrictions on resales of securities areof concern even to institutional investors who initially purchase securitiesas part of a buy and hold strategy, because they limited the institution'sability to resell securities in changing market conditions. Rather thanimposing specific transfer restrictions, the Commission has chosen to requirethat the securities be issued in relatively large denominations and thatthe underwriter have a reasonable belief that the securities are beingacquired by the purchaser for investment. Consistent with current practice, the Commission believes that an underwriterwill satisfy its obligation under paragraph (c)(1) if it obtains a statementindicating that the investor has purchased the securities with investmentintent. Furthermore, as suggested by the American Bar Association, in orderto maintain the integrity of the 35 person limit, the Rule requires thateach of the purchasers acquire securities for only one account. Finally,the Rule requires that the underwriter make a subjective determinationthat each investor have the knowledge and experience required to evaluatethe merits and risks of the prospective investment.\7\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that this procedure also is consistentwith the current practice in the municipal securities markets, where limitedplacements are generally made only to institutional purchasers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\4\ This differs from Regulation D under the SecuritiesAct, which provides that the issuer in private placements may presume thataccredited investors meet the purchaser qualifications. (a) <T3>Definition of Underwriter.</T3> Some commentators suggested that sincethe term ``underwriter'' in the Proposed Rule \7\\5\<NOTE/> was defined as a broker, dealer, or municipal securitiesdealer who participated in a ``distribution'' the Commission had createdan implicit private placement exception.\7\\6\<NOTE/> Specifically, they noted that persons selling securitiesin an offering that did not involve a distribution would not be subjectto the Rule. The word ``distribution'', which was used in the definitionof ``underwriter'' in the Proposed Rule, has been replaced with the term``offering''. This change is intended to clarify that a broker, dealeror municipal securities dealer may be acting as underwriter, for purposesof the Rule, in connection with a private offering. Unless the offeringmeets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1), the underwriter would be subjectto the requirements of the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\5\ The Proposed Rule defined ``underwriter'' to include``any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or offersor sells to, an issuer in connection with the distribution of, any security. . .'' The definition in the Proposed Rule paralleled the definition insection 2(11) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77b(11), with one modificationto more clearly reflect the terminology used in the municipal securitiesindustry for a customary distributor's or seller's commission. <T3>See</T3> Release, 53 FR at 37786, n. 58.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\6\ <T3>See generally</T3> Securities Act Release No. 6806 (October 21, 1988)53 FR 44016, at n.145 (discussing the term ``distribution'' in the contextof the definition of ``underwriter'' found in section 2(11) of the SecuritiesAct). <T3>But see</T3> Rule 10b-6(c)(5) of the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 10b-6(c)(5)(defining for purposes of that rule, the term distribution to mean an offeringof securities that is distinguished from ordinary trading by the magnitudeof the offering and special selling efforts and selling methods).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Short-Term Securities </ITAG>Another issue on which the Commission requested comment was whether anexemption should be provided for short-term debt. Of the commentators whoresponded to this issue, many distinguished between traditional short-termdebt, such as bond, tax, and revenue anticipation notes, which may be soldto a variety of investors, and tax-exempt commercial paper, which primarilyis sold in large denominations to institutional investors.\7\\7\<NOTE/> Commentators argued that imposition of the requirements ofthe Rule to tax-exempt commercial paper would seriously impact an issuer'sability to enter the market. The MSRB, along with others, also comparedshort-term municipal debt to corporate commercial paper that is exemptfrom the registration provisions of the Securities Act.\7\\8\<NOTE/> The MSRB noted that its own rule G-32 contains a specificexemption for tax-exempt commercial paper.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\7\ The Commission understands that concerns about reissuanceproblems under the federal tax laws have reduced true tax-exempt commercialpaper offerings in recent years. In 1988, for example, only 16 issues oftax-exempt commercial paper, amounting to $1,142 million were offered.This figure is up from 6 offerings in 1987, amounting to $65 million. Source:IDD/PSA Database.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\8\ Section 3(a) (3) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(3)exempts from registration ``[a]ny note, draft, bill of exchange, or bankersacceptance which arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds ofwhich have been or are to be used for current transactions, and which hasa maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusiveof days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewiselimited''.After reviewing the comment letters, the Commission has determined to providean exemption for offerings of short-term debt with fixed maturities ofless than nine months.\79\<NOTE/> As with the other exemptions, underwriters would only beable to use the exemption in those offerings in which the securities areissued in authorized denominations of $100,000 or more. The Commissionbelieves that the philosophy of the exemption is consistent with the exemptionin section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act.\80\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, the Commission does not want to imply a directcorrelation between tax-exempt commercial paper, as the term is used frequentlyin the municipal markets, and commercial paper offered pursuant to Section3(a)(3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ In 1988, 1,482 short-term bond issues (less than 13 months),totaling $23,125 million, were offered with par amounts exceeding $1 million.Four hundred ninety offerings above one million, with a total par amountof 6,246.9 million, had final maturities of less than nine months. Source:IDD/PSA Database.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ <T3>See generally,</T3> Securities Act Release 4412 (Sept. 20, 1961) 26FR 9158 (discussing short-term corporate debt).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Securities With Demand Features</ITAG>In addition to traditional short-term debt issues with fixed maturitiesof less than nine months, many issuers have utilized multi-mode bonds andvariable rate demand notes as a means of efficiently financing their operations.Variable rate demand notes have fixed maturities equivalent to long-termbonds, but provide the purchaser with the opportunity to tender the bondsto the issuer or a third-party liquidity facility at preset tender datesthat may be weekly, monthly, or annually. By offering variable rate demandnotes, or tender option bonds, the investor is able to reduce interestrate risk, while the issuer can offer short-term yields on long-term bonds.Variable rate demand notes, as well as tax-exempt commercial paper, maybe a component of multi-mode offerings that permit the issuer to convertoutstanding debt from short-term variable rates to long-term fixed rates.Investors are notified of the issuer's determination to exercise its conversionoption and typically are given the opportunity to redeem their securitiesat par or retain the securities in their converted form. Bonds that areredeemed upon conversion are generally offered pursuant to a remarketingagreement, with liquidity support typically provided by a third-party financialinstitution.Although the use of variable rate financing has declined in recent yearsin response to a flattening of the yield curve, the Commission recognizesthat variable rate debt remains an important method of financing for manyissuers.\81\<NOTE/> Some commentators expressed concern that applying the provisionsof the Proposed Rule to variable rate demand notes, or similar securities,might unnecessarily hinder the operation of this market, if underwriterswere required to comply with the provisions of the Proposed Rule on eachtender or reset date. To assure that these means of financing are not unnecessarilyaffected, the Commission has provided an exemption in Rule 15c2-12 thatpermits sales of variable rate demand notes and other flexible mode securitieswith effective maturities of less than nine months.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ Issuance of variable rate demand obligations peaked in1985, at $66,855 million (based on issues with a par amount exceeding $5million). In 1988, 903 issues were offered, with a total volume of $21,622million. Source: IDD/PSA Database.Paragraph (c)(3) provides an exemption for securities issued in authorizeddenominations of $100,000 or more that, at the option of the holder, maybe tendered to an issuer of such securities, or its designated agent, forredemption or purchase at par value or more, at least as frequently asevery nine months until maturity, or earlier redemption, or until suchsecurities are remarketed in a primary offering. Thus, variable rate demandnotes, tax-exempt commercial paper with an automatic roll-over feature,and tender option bonds with maturities or reset dates of less than ninemonths, would be eligible for the exemption. In multi-mode offerings, uponconversion to a fixed maturity of greater than nine months, the exemptionwould no longer be applicable and any primary offering of the securitiesby a remarketing agent would be subject to the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Exemptive Authority</ITAG>In addition to the express exemptions contained in paragraphs (c)(1), (2)and (3) of the Rule, paragraph (d) provides that the Commission may, uponwritten request, or upon its own motion, exempt any participating underwriterfrom any requirement of the Rule. The Commission recognizes that thereis a continuing evolution in financial products and the means of sellingsecurities. While the Commission believes that the exemptions containedin the Rule will accommodate those offerings in which current practiceis appropriate, without the need for the additional requirements of theRule, it is also aware that instances may arise where the objectives ofthe Rule can be achieved without strict compliance with its provisions.Paragraph (d) permits the Commission to exempt from the Rule underwritersparticipating in particular primary offerings of municipal securities,or classes of transactions, either unconditionally, or upon specified termsand conditions. In determining whether any exemption is appropriate, theCommission would consider whether such an exemption is consistent withthe public interest and the protection of investors. Among other things,the Commission would, in some cases, expect persons requesting an exemptionto demonstrate that the objectives of the Rule can be achieved using alternativeprocedures. In light of the fact that the Rule codifies, to a great degree,responsible industry practice, and the fact that the current exemptionsare designed to adequately accommodate financing techniques where departurefrom the specific provisions of the Rule is appropriate, the Commissiondoes not expect that exemptions will be granted routinely.\8\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\2\ In conjunction with the adoption of the Rule, the Commissionalso is adopting Rule 30-3(a)(48) of the Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 241.30-3(a)(48),which delegates to the Division of Market Regulation, the authority togrant exemptive requests under Rule 15c2-12. Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 26986 (June 28, 1989). The Commission expects that the Division willconsider any exemptive requests in light of the goals of the Rule and willsubmit such matters to the Commission for consideration as appropriate.Requests for exemptive relief, as well as interpretive and no-action adviceconcerning the Rule, should conform with the Commission's published proceduresand should be addressed to the Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation,Mail Stop 5-1, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549.The procedures to be followed in requesting no-action or exemptive reliefare outlined in Securities Act Release No. 5127, 36 FR 2600 (Jan. 25, 1971);<T3>see generally, </T3>Lemke, <T3>The SEC No-Action Letter Process, </T3>42 <T3>Bus. Law. </T3>1019 (1987).E. Transitional ProvisionParagraph (f) of the Rule provides an exemption from the provisions ofthe Rule relating to the dissemination of the final official statements,for remarketings of securities that were initially issued prior to July28, 1989, and where the underwriter has a contractual commitment to actas remarketing agent. The transition period applies only to paragraphs(b)(3) and (b)(4) of the Rule. The Commission does not believe there isa need for an exemption from the other paragraphs of the Rule, since disseminationof a preliminary official statement is only required if one is preparedand the information needed to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of the Ruleis information reasonably foreseeable as necessary to facilitate compliancewith the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws that werein effect at the time of the contract. In this regard, the Commission understandsthat it is common to provide in remarketing agreements that the remarketingagent will have access to the information necessary to comply with thefederal securities laws.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Interpretation of Underwriter Responsibilities</ITAG>In the Release, the Commission also included an interpretation of the responsibilitiesof underwriters of municipal securities under the general antifraud provisionsof the federal securities laws.\83\<NOTE/> In light of the practices revealed in the staff's investigationof the Supply System default, the Commission determined it was appropriateto articulate clearly the obligations of underwriters participating inmunicipal offerings. While the focus of the Interpretation was on activitiesof underwriters, the Commission recognizes that the primary responsibilityfor disclosure rests with the issuer.\84\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ The Interpretation was based on judicial and administrativedecisions applying the federal securities laws and did not address theresponsibilities of underwriters under the MSRB's rules or the provisionsof state securities laws. Underwriters should be aware that their responsibilitiesunder state securities laws may be different from those articulated inthe Commission's Interpretation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ Although the focus of the Commission's Interpretationwas on underwriter practices, issuers are primarily responsible for thecontent of their disclosure documents and may be held liable under thefederal securities laws for misleading disclosure. <T3>See, e.g. In re Washington Public Power Supply System Securities Litigation,</T3>623 F. Supp 1466, 1478-1480 (W.D.Wa. 1985), <T3>aff'd, </T3>823 F.2d 1349 (9th Cir. 1987); <T3>In re Citisource, Inc. Securities Litigation, </T3>694 F. Supp. 1069,1072-1075 (S.D.NY 1988); <T3>In re New York City Municipal Securities Litigation, </T3>507 F. Supp.169, 184-185 (S.D.N.Y. 1980). Because they are ultimately liable for thecontent of their disclosure, issuers should insist that any persons retainedto assist in the preparation of their disclosure documents have a professionalunderstanding of the disclosure requirements under the federal securitieslaws.The Interpretation applies to all offerings of municipal securities, regardlessof whether the offering is subject to the provisions of Rule 15c2-12. TheInterpretation emphasized the obligation of underwriters under the generalantifraud provisions of the federal securities laws to have a reasonablebasis for recommending any municipal securities. The Interpretation notedthat when the underwriter provides disclosure documents to investors, itmakes an implied representation that it has a reasonable basis for beliefin the accuracy and completeness of the key representations contained inthe documents.The Interpretation stated that the extent of review necessary for the underwriterto attain a reasonable basis for its belief in the accuracy and completenessof key representations in the final official statement will depend uponall the circumstances. The factors enumerated in the Interpretation were:the extent to which the underwriter relied upon municipal officials, employees,experts and other persons whose duties have given them special knowledgeof particular facts; the type of underwriting arrangement (<T3>e.g.</T3> firm commitment or best efforts); the role of the underwriter(manager, syndicate member, or selected dealer); the type of bonds beingoffered (general obligation, revenue, or private activity); the past familiarityof the underwriter with the issuer; the length of time to maturity of thebonds; the presence or absence of credit enhancements; and whether thebonds are competitively bid or are distributed in a negotiated offering.The Interpretation stated that, at a minimum, the Commission expects thatin all offerings underwriters will review the issuer's disclosure document(s)in a professional manner for possible inaccuracies and omissions.\85\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ In offerings where the issuer has not produced disclosuredocuments, including those that are exempted from Rule 15c2-12, the underwritermust take other measures to develop a reasonable basis for its recommendation.The Interpretation presented the Commission's view of the current responsibilitiesof underwriters of municipal securities under the federal securities laws.It did not create new standards of liability.\86\<NOTE/> Moreover, although the Interpretation was based on judicialdecisions and previous administrative actions, the Commission sought commenton the extent to which underwriters currently meet the standards articulatedin the Interpretation, and whether alternative formulations of the Interpretationwould be more appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ The Commission explained in the Release that the factorsset forth in the Interpretation do not change the applicable legal standardsagainst which the underwriter's conduct must be measured, or attempt toset an objective standard against which to measure recklessness for purposesof any scienter requirement under specific antifraud provisions. Release53 FR at 37789, n. 84.The Commission received comments on the Interpretation from all segmentsof the municipal industry. Most comments addressing the issue agreed thatthe Interpretation accurately reflected practices currently employed byresponsible underwriters of municipal securities. In light of the comments,the Commission remains convinced that the Interpretation correctly articulatesthe legal responsibilities of underwriters of municipal securities underthe federal securities laws. Nevertheless, the Commission has determinedto clarify and modify limited portions of the Interpretation to addressconcerns raised by commentators. Some commentators suggested additional factors that should be includedamong those enumerated in the Interpretation, while others disputed therelevance of some factors that were cited. In this regard, the Commissionwishes to further emphasize that the factors enumerated in the Interpretationwere not intended to be an exclusive list of factors bearing upon the reasonablenessof the underwriter's investigation. While the Commission believes that,as modified below, the factors cited generally will be relevant in mostofferings, any determination about the reasonableness of the underwriter'sinvestigation in a particular offering ``will depend upon all the circumstances''and will likely include factors not enumerated in the Interpretation asmodified.\87\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ Indeed, the factors that have been withdrawn below maybe relevant in particular circumstances.Similarly, certain factors specificially enumerated in the Interpretationmay not be relevant in some offerings.\88\<NOTE/> In this regard, the Commission had determined that the commentsgenerated in response to two of the factors enumerated in the Interpretationsuggest that these factors are sufficiently ambiguous so as not to be relevantin most offerings. Thus, the Interpretation is modified to the extent thatit indicates that the nature of the underwriting arrangement (<T3>e.g., </T3>best efforts or firm commitment) would generally be a signficantfactor in assessing the reasonableness of the underwriter's investigationin muncipal offerings. In addition, although the Commission included thepresence or absence of credit enhancements as a consideration that mightbe relevant in gauging the underwriter's investigation, it is apparent,based upon the comments, that there is a diversity of opinion among participantsin the municipal markets regarding the protection actually provided bycredit enhancements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ For example, the Commission stated in the Interpretationthat the fact an offering is nominally classified as competitively bidwould not be relevant to the scope of an underwriter's review, where thereis little uncertainty about the choice of underwriters or where other factorsare present that would command a closer examination.In the Commission's view, the presence of credit enhancements generallywould not be a substitute for material disclosure concerning the primaryobligor on municipal bonds.\89\<NOTE/> Several commentators, including analysts, investors, andinsurers, have indicated that even in credit enhanced offerings they relyupon disclosure concerning the primary obligor. In credit enhanced offerings,there is event risk, including default or the primary obligor, that mayimpair the value of the municipal bonds. Empirical evidence was providedby the Association of Financial Guarantors illustrating the discount imposedby the market on credit enhanced offerings, compared to offerings withsimilar ratings without credit enhancements.\90\<NOTE/> In light of these comments, the Commission wishes to emphasizethat the presence of credit enhancement does not foreclose the need fora reasonable investigation of the accuracy and completeness of key representationsconcerning the primary obligor. Accordingly, the Interpretation is modifiedto the extent that it suggests the presence or absence of credit enhancementsgenerally would be a significant factor in assessing the reasonablenessof the underwriter's investigation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ The Commission noted in 1987, in the context of an examinationof the financial guarantee markets, that: <ITAG tagnum="28">[w]hile the presence of a guarantor is a material factor that investorsmay wish to consider in determining whether to invest in a particular debtissue, the Commission does not believe that it can, in general, serve asa substitute for disclosure of material information regarding the offering.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Investors in public offerings of securities backed by insurance policieshave an interest in information allowing them to assess the financial resourcesof both the issuer and the insurer.

Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations</ITAG>Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act \91\<NOTE/> requires that the Commission, in adopting rules under theAct, consider the anticompetitive effects of such rules, if any, and balanceany anticompetitive impact against the regulatory benefits gained in termsof furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act.
