In addition, 63 percent of those polled by Newsweek magazinebelieve that Bush was more involved in the Iran-Contra scandal thanhe has said. And a larger number, 82 percent, now believe thatformer President Reagan was more involved than he has admitted.   Fifty-five percent want Bush to tell more of his role in theaffair, the survey found.   The poll, to be published in Newsweek's May 15 issue, found thatwhile 51 percent believe Bush should pardon North, only 34 percentbelieve he will. Sixty-six percent believe North should not beimprisoned.   A second poll by Time magazine and CNN found that 45 percent ofthose surveyed believe that Bush should pardon North, while 39percent said he should not. A majority of 53 percent, however, feltNorth should not go to jail; 32 percent thought he should.   Sixty-seven percent in the Time-CNN poll said they believed thatBush had not told the whole truth about his involvement in theIran-Contra scandal; 17 percent thought he had.   North was a key figure in the Iran-Contra affair, in whichfederal officials sought to sell arms to Iran to raise money forU.S.-backed Contra forces in Central America at a time whenCongress had stopped military assistance to the rebels.   On Thursday, North was convicted of shredding documents, failingto pay for a $13,000 security system at his home and aiding andabetting the obstruction of Congress in connection with thescandal. But he was found innocent of nine other charges.   The former National Security Council aide faces a maximum of 10years plus a fine of up to $750,000. His sentencing is scheduledfor June 23.   The Newsweek and Time-CNN polls both found Americans to bedivided on the jury's verdict, but the results varied widely.   In the Newsweek poll, 31 percent agreed with the verdict, 39percent thought it too harsh, and 19 percent thought it toolenient. In the Time-CNN poll, 47 percent agreed with the verdict,33 percent did not and 20 percent were not sure.   The Time-CNN telephone poll of 504 adults was taken byYankelovich Clancy Shulman on Thursday, the day North was convictedof three counts. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percent.   Newsweek's telephone poll was conducted by the GallupOrganization on Friday. It is a national sample of 500 adults andhas a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
