Thehigher prices helped some oil company stocks but contributedto declines in U.S. stock and bond markets.</LP><TEXT>   The steep rise in petroleum prices -- more than $1 abarrel for most crudes -- came even as some small oilexporters planned to try to follow leading members of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in raisingoutput. Trinidad, Malaysia and others were said yesterday tobe among those planning to increase output, to add to thehigher volumes already being produced by Saudi Arabia,Venezuela and some other OPEC nations.   Also yesterday, Mexico said its extra 100,000 barrels aday of oil exports will continue until the end of the year,rather than the end of this month as originally pledged.   However, most non-OPEC oil producers already are believedto be running flat out. There is considerable skepticismwhether any of them can produce much more oil, even in modestincrements. Also, there is doubt the new OPEC supplies canreplace all the oil lost from the embargo against Iraq -- orcan reach the oil market in time to fill the gap left by the4.3 million barrels a day of former Iraqi and Kuwaitiexports.   &quot;Temporarily, there is a lag between the cutoffs {of Iraqiand Kuwaiti oil} and the increased production,&quot; said Roger W.Gale, president of the Washington International Energy Group,a consulting firm. That gap is going to be showing up, hesaid, in reductions in volume in the oil market, where demandalready is rising seasonally.   The main concern among energy watchdogs for majoroil-consuming nations, such as the Paris-based InternationalEnergy Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy, is that thebiggest potential for tight supplies, and possibly shortages,will be during the winter peak-use period. It could start asearly as November as the heating-oil season gets under way incolder climates.   Heating oil, in fact, set yesterday's pricing pace. Inheavy U.S. futures trading, heating oil for October deliveryrose 4.87 cents a gallon to settle at 88.24 cents. Unleadedgasoline for October delivery settled at 95.07 cents, up 2.8cents a gallon.   The crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,which is similar to the benchmark West Texas Intermediate,jumped $1.66 a barrel to settle at $31.43 for Octoberdelivery.   Another wave of higher price postings swept through theoil fields, meanwhile, with refiners generally raising theprices they pay for West Texas Intermediate by $1.75 abarrel, to as much as $30.   The gains in U.S. prices followed jumps in Asia andEurope. Spot prices of Europe's North Sea crudes were up by$1 to $1.20 a barrel. Some trading officials said thisunderscores a shift from U.S. pricing leadership.   &quot;The driving force in the markets today is in Europe andin the Far East,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, London-based manager ofthe Shearson Lehman Hutton international energy desk. He saidstrong European currencies and a weak U.S. dollar -- thecurrency used to price and pay for oil -- make up one reason.Another, he said, is that European and Asian buyers expectsupply disruptions by the fourth quarter.   Many traders expressed surprise, nevertheless, at the highlevels oil prices are again reaching. Some look for a majorpullback, possibly as soon as today, similar to the$4-a-barrel drop that followed the August price surge kickedoff by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the resulting U.S.-Iraqarmed faceoff in the Gulf region.   Price corrections are sure to come if supplies proveadequate after all the talk of possible shortages. And thehigher prices are helping to bring on new supplies. Mexicowill continue its increased oil exports for the remainder ofthe year &quot;to take advantage of rising prices,&quot; Petroleos deMexicanos said in its announcement yesterday.   Charles A. Gargano, U.S. ambassador to Trinidad, said inan interview that Trinidad is considering a 5% to 10%increase in its production of some 150,000 barrels a dayafter his request to government oil authorities.   &quot;We have asked all our friends who are oil producers tohelp out the situation now,&quot; he said. Any output increasethere &quot;may be small,&quot; he said, &quot;but it's symbolic they arewilling to try to help.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
