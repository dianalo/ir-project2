Prepregnancy planning will help you deliver a full-term, optimumweight baby, says the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. Theorganization says that the infant mortality rate in the UnitedStates exceeds that of 18 other countries.   The foundation recommends a visit to the obstetrician before youbecome pregnant to detect and prevent problems that might affect thefetus in the earliest stages of development. It's particularlyimportant if you already have had a problem during a previouspregnancy.   You'll be screened for infections such as toxoplasmosis, rubella,cytomegalovirus or hepatitis B. If you test positive, you can followup with appropriate vaccinations or counseling.   Chronic health problems _ diabetes, hypertension, thyroid diseaseand epilepsy _ will be analyzed for risks to you or your baby. Forexample, if you are diabetic, you have an excellent chance todeliver a healthy baby without complications if you have continuousmedical care and keep your blood sugar under tight control.   Inherited or ethnically linked diseases like Tay-Sachs or sicklecell anemia may prompt a prepregnancy genetic screening. Women over35 also can look at options and weigh the age-related risk ofchromosome defects.   The workup also will include a discussion of lifestyle, diet andexercise, helping you develop new programs to change behaviors andhabits that may pose a threat to the fetus.</TEXT></DOC>
