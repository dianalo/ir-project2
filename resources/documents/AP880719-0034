At least two workers in the building escaped safely after thefire broke out about 8:20 p.m. No injuries were reported, saidBattalion Chief Bob Defeo.   On May 4, the worst high-rise fire in the city's history killedone man and injured 40 people at the nearby First Interstate bankbuilding.   ``There were some lessons learned in the First Interstatefire,'' said Inspector Ed Reed, who told reporters thatfirefighters quickly raced up 34 floors to get to the Union Bankfire before it could rage out of control.   In the First Interstate blaze, firefighters had had difficultyreaching the flames.   Monday's fire was declared extinguished shortly after 9 p.m.,said fire spokesman Jim Williamson. About 75 firefighters were atthe scene.   Michael Turner said he was working on the 35th floor when thefire broke out.   ``I was in our law library doing some research, and I felt twoexplosions which I thought was an earthquake,'' he said. ``When Irealized it wasn't an earthquake, I went back to my desk and thefire alarm went off.''   ``I went and found a co-worker. We looked out one of the windowsand saw flames coming up, and we got the heck out of there.''   The fire burned two offices on the 34th floor and 1{ offices onthe 35th floor, said Defeo, adding, ``This was nowhere near theInterstate fire. We got it in time.''   Before the fire was controlled, a television news helicoptercircled the tower and spotted flames coming from an upper-storyoffice and thick smoke coming from other windows.   The Union Bank tower is located within blocks of the FirstInterstate Bank building.   A sprinkler system was being installed at the First Interstatebuilding, but was not yet operating on the night the firedevastated the upper floors of the state's tallest skyscraper.   Alexander Handy, a 24-year-old maintenance worker, died after hebecame trapped in an elevator. Several people were trapped insidethe smoke-filled building for hours as firefighters worked torescue them.   The Union Bank building was equipped with sprinklers in thebasement and on the 30th floor, according to Fire Departmentrecords. It was built before the 1974 city ordinance requiringsprinklers in high-rises.</TEXT></DOC>
