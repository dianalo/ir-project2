It consistsof a cold storage tank, compressor, condenser, load heat source and chillerunit, etc. When a small amount of surface active agent is added as additivewith the indirect system, clathrate was generated 4 - 5 times fasterthan when no additive was used. This can be said as a nearly ideal clathrategeneration. In the case of the direct system, the rate was only 1.5 timesof the case where no additive was added. The effects of surface activeagents considerably differed depending on the types. No remarkable differencewas observed when the concentration of the surface active agent was 0.005- 0.1 wt%, which indicated that 0.01 - 0.1 wt% can be appropriate forthe cold storage material. Based on the result of the above experimentfor elements, a bench plant was designed, produced and has been in operation.(10 figs, 2 photos, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
