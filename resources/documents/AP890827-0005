Hilary has been missing for two years on Monday, since aWashington judge ordered her mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, tosurrender the youngster for unsupervised visits with her father.Morgan refused to comply and remains in jail on contempt of courtcharges.   Morgan claims that Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, sexuallyabused the girl. Foretich vehemently denies the allegation andcontends that his former wife is suffering from delusions.   While the parents' struggle continues, mental healthprofessionals are questioning whether Hilary can survive the ordealwithout emotional scars.   ``For any child, a separation from both parents on an abrupt andsudden basis is very harmful and could cause serious long-termconsequences,'' said Dr. Jerry Wiener, president of the AmericanAcademy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. ``There's no way thatshe could not be significantly affected from this experience, and Iwould think that any effects could not be undone.''   Constance Ahrons, a noted California psychologist in the field ofchild custody cases and author of the book ``Divorced Families,''said Hilary's separation from her parents could leave the childfeeling isolated, even under protective custody.   ``This is bound to have a profound effect on her,'' Ahrons said.``If she was close to her parents, she may feel abandoned. In a caselike this, the child is the most vulnerable because of her age andbecause she has no control in what happens to her.''   Linda Holman, Hilary's court-appointed attorney, declined to beinterviewed and said she refuses all media requests for interviewsconcerning this case. She said such interviews ``contribute to thelong-term negative impact on Hilary.''   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon has saidMorgan will remain in jail for contempt of court until shesurrenders Hilary.   A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals,the city's highest local court, ordered that Morgan be released.However, the entire court overturned that decision on Aug. 21 _Hilary's seventh birthday _ and ordered a new hearing on the casebefore the full court next month.   That same day, Foretich and about a dozen family members andfriends marked his daughter's birthday with a small ceremony on thesteps of the Capitol. Legislation passed by the House and awaiting avote by the full Senate would limit the length of contempt jailingsin the nation's capital and, in effect, free Morgan.   Later that same day, Foretich told The Associated Press he thinksHilary is suffering through an experience that could ultimately leadto an early death.   ``If my daughter is not brought back within the near future, itwill be too late. She will lose her ability to ever recover fromthis,'' he said. ``I knew her to be a resilient child, but at somepoint that resilience is going to fade. I don't want my daughter tobe an example, another statistic, of a teen-age suicide because shefeels abandoned by both parents and has been led to believe that herfather is a pervert and her mother is a crazy woman.''   Morgan did not respond to a written request for an interviewrelayed through jail officials.   However, Mary Froning, a child psychologist who treated Hilaryfor two years at her mother's request, said the only hardship thatthe young girl has undergone is being apart from her mother for solong.   ``Her ordeal is being separated from her mother, the only personin the world she trusts,'' Froning said. ``She is with the peopleshe chose to be with, so I have every reason to believe she issafe.''   Wiener, however, wondered whether the one-way communication thathe presumes Hilary receives isn't hurting the girl.   ``One presumes she is told positive things about her mother andnegative things about her father,'' Weiner said. ``That is notconstructive, not at all.''   Ahrons said she also was concerned that some problems couldresult from the girl acting as a fugitive to disguise her realidentity.   ``There are certainly possible problems with issues concerningher own identity,'' said Ahrons. ``It could have some effect on herlife. A profound effect? Who knows?''   Foretich has his own theory. ``At what point will Hilary cease toeven know who she is?'' he asked.   ``I mean, how many times has her name been changed, has her hairbeen colored? Does she even know who she is anymore? Her self-imagewill soon be destroyed, if it hasn't already happened.''</TEXT></DOC>
