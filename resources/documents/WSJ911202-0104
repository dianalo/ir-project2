The National Organization of Life and Health InsuranceGuaranty Associations, or Nolhga, said it is asking itsmembers to back a $3.55 billion bid by Altus Finance, a unitof French bank Credit Lyonnais S.A. That would clear the wayfor a quick resolution to the nation's second-largestinsurance failure, and shelve a rival bid by Nolhga forExecutive Life.</LP><TEXT>   As reported, Altus would buy most of Executive Life's junkbonds for $3.25 billion in cash. A French investor group ledby Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France would then investan additional $300 million and continue Executive Life undera new name.   In a statement, Nolhga explained its change of heart bysaying the benefits to policyholders under the revised Altusplan have improved &quot;very substantially.&quot; A Nolhga spokeswomansaid the plan would provide full reimbursement for 97% of allcovered Executive Life policyholders. The 47 state insuranceguaranty funds would have to pay about $1.8 billion to coverpolicyholder and annuity claims.   The spokeswoman said the guaranty funds have been asked toapprove the plan by Thursday, and noted that funds inCalifornia, Pennsylvania, Florida and Illinois have indicatedthey would back the bid. If the funds do not approve theplan, it is possible that Nolhga would revive its earlierbid, she added.   Any rescue plan must be approved by state Superior CourtJudge Kurt Lewin, who is overseeing the Executive Life case.</TEXT></DOC>
