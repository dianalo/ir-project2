Seymour,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Secretary for Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Narrative Statement for the Department of Transportation Federal AviationAdministration</ITAG>Explanation of Change:The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to revise the existingsystem of records, General Air Transportation Records on Individuals, DOT/FAA847, to add three additional routine uses and make editorial changes tothe rest of the system description.One routine use, (a), has been added to permit the disclosure of basiccertification information to the public upon request. Basic informationabout certificated airmen has historically been provided by the AeronauticalCenter systems managers of DOT/FAA 847, General Air Transportation Recordson Individuals. Such information is either given directly to public requestersor to FAA public affairs officers and other FAA employees who, in turn,release it to the media and other requesters. The information releasedpertains only to certificates, ratings, privileges, limitations, and othersuch information which historically has been considered in the public domain.Information which, if released, might constitute an unwarranted invasionof privacy (e.g., social security numbers, dates of birth, test score results,pending enforcement actions, etc.) is never released unless required orauthorized by some other provision of law.The second routine use, (b), has been added to make necessary records availableto the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for accident investigationpurposes. The NTSB investigates civil aircraft accidents to determine andreport publicly, the facts, conditions, and circumstances relating to eachaccident and the probable cause thereof. Currently, authorized representativesof NTSB have the explicit statutory authority to ``inspect, at reasonabletimes, records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities relevantto the investigation * * *.'' (49 U.S.C. section 1903(b)(2)). When theperformance of an airman or air traffic controller may have been a factorin an accident, NTSB should have access to medical records in the possessionof the FAA. Such access is proper and necessary to the NTSB's investigationso that a determination can be made whether any medical, physiological,or psychological conditions may have been causal or contributory to theaccident. Also, a determination by the NTSB that there were no such contributoryfactors is an important aspect of focusing on the probable cause. NTSB'suse of medical data in this fashion will be consistent and compatible withthe reasons for which the data are obtained.A third routine use, (c), has been added to permit disclosure of necessaryinformation about airmen to Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencieswhen those entities are engaged in the investigation or apprehension ofdrug law violators. This provision is considered compatible with the purposefor which these airman records are maintained in view of the recently-addedSection 609(c)(1) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1429(c)(1)).That section essentially mandates that the Administrator shall revoke thecertificate of any airman who is convicted of a crime under Federal orstate law relating to controlled substances, if the Administrator determinesthat: (1) An aircraft was used in the commission of the offense, and (2)the individual served as an airman, or was on board the aircraft, in connectionwith the commission of the crime. Since this 1984 amendment has now introduceddrug-related offenses as the basis for the revocation of airmen certificates,we believe that disclosure of airmen registry information is appropriatewhen it can be established that the law enforcement agency requesting itis engaged in a drug-related investigation or enforcement effort.Other routine uses will undergo changes. Six of the routine uses currentlylisted are strictly for internal use covered under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1)and are not considered routine uses. These will be taken out of the routineuse section. One of the routine uses listed duplicates one listed in theDepartment of Transportation prefatory statement of routine uses and assuch need not be listed again. It will be removed. The remaining routineuses will be rewritten for clarification.The following statements, which are written in compliance with the termsof the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix 1,entitled ``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records AboutIndividuals,'' (50 Federal Register 52738 (1985)), describe the revisedsystem.1. <T3>Purpose of system. </T3>The General Air Transportation Records on Individuals,DOT/FAA 847, contains a broad range of information, including informationused for issuance of airmen certificates, and on individuals against whomenforcement action has been taken, plus accident/incident and medical recordsinformation.2. <T3>Authority under which the system is maintained. </T3>5 U.S.C. 301,49 U.S.C. 1341(a), 49 U.S.C. 1429.3. <T3>Effect on individual rights. </T3>The information in this system isused in accordance with the purpose for which it was collected and in accordancewith the stated routine uses.

Basic informationin this file concerning the qualifications of airmen has traditionallybeen regarded as available to the public upon request. Examples of basicinformation about these individuals include the type of certificates andratings held, the date and class of latest physical, pilot's license number,and information relating to the status of the airmen's certificate; thatis, whether it is current or has been suspended or revoked for any reason.The file also serves as a repository for legal documents that relate toan individual's physical status or condition used to determine statisticallythe validity of FAA medical standards. These files are used to provideinformation for determining eligibility for airmen medical certification,for review of requests for exemption from medical requirements, and forreview of certificate denials. Also, the information in the system is usedto inform airmen of meetings and seminars conducted by the FAA regardingaviation safety.routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categoriesof users and the purposes of such uses: These records and information in these records may be used: a. To provide basic airmen certification and qualification informationto the public upon request. b.
