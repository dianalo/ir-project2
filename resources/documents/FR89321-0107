(Similar provisions are contained in Parts30, 40, and 72.) These requirements are necessarily general, for they mustbe applicable to a variety of nuclear fuel cycle activities. Over the years,the Commission staff has developed different types of guidance to supplementthe general requirements. These have taken the form of Regulatory Guides,Standard Format and Content documents, and Branch Technical Positions.In addition, applicants' and the staff's experience with applications andlicenses has evolved into a reasonable understanding of what informationshould be provided and what will be approved.Notwithstanding the supplementary guidance provided to expand and explainthe general requirements, there have been certain topics for which guidancehas not been provided at all, or provided in less than completely adequateform. The staff had been working on numerous suggestions and recommendations,made both inside and outside of the Commission, for improving the regulationof radioactive materials, especially after the January 4, 1986 accidentat the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation's uranium hexafluoride conversion facility.As one result of this accident, the NRC's Executive Director for Operationsestablished the Materials Safety Regulation Review Study Group (MSRRSG)in May 1986. The MSRRSG recommendations covering the licensing and inspectionprogram were not unique, and as mentioned above, were already in variousstages of consideration or implementation.One group of the MSRRSG recommendations dealt with administrative aspectsof NRC operations, including organizational changes, training, procedures,and schedules. Most of these were addressed as a part of the NRC reorganizationin April 1987. Others have been and are continuing to be pursued in thecontext of the new organization. The other group of MSRRSG recommendationsrelated to radiation and industrial safety concerns, e.g., nonradiologicalhazards, emergency preparedness, and radiography safety. The last two havebeen handled by separate rulemaking actions.During the same period of time that the MSRRSG report was being preparedand evaluated, the staff undertook a series of team assessments of operationalsafety at the major fuel facilities licensed by the NRC. These assessmentswere conducted by Regional and Headquarters NRC staff, as well as OSHAand EPA personnel in most cases, and FEMA in two of the assessments. Themost important safety issues identified as needing attention by licenseeswere in the areas of fire protection, chemical hazards identification andmitigation, management controls/quality assurance, safety-related instrumentationand maintenance, and emergency preparedness. These findings contributedto and support the staff's position on the MSRRSG recommendations. Likewise,the recommendations contained in the Lessons Learned Report from the SequoyahFuels Corporation accident (NUREG-1198) and the U.S. House of Representatives'Committee on Government Operations report, ``NRC's Regulation of Fuel CycleFacilities: A Paper Tiger,'' were consistent with the findings.As a first step toward making improvements in the identified areas of managementcontrols/quality assurance, requirements for operation, chemical safety,and fire safety, Branch Technical Positions have been prepared for guidance.It is the NRC's intent that the guidance will later be incorporated, alongwith other topics, in license application standard format and content documents.These documents in turn would be used in the preparation of standard reviewplans for the safety of major fuel cycle facilities. Branch Technical Positionsprovide guidance to applicants and licensees for preparation of applicationsfor licenses and conduct of operations and provide guidance for the staffin reviewing applications and inspecting facilities. However, Branch TechnicalPositions do not carry the force of regulation; and other equipment, facilities,and procedures may be acceptable for meeting regulatory requirements. Foreach of the Branch Technical Positions which follow, the background ofeach issue is described, including a definition of the issue and its generalapplicability. A discussion section includes the objectives of the BranchTechnical Position and the principles to be used. A position section describesspecific guidance but not methods of implementation at this time. Finally,references used in development of the Branch Technical Positions are listed.<ITAG tagnum="84">BRANCH TECHNICAL POSITION ON MANAGEMENT CONTROLS/QUALITY ASSURANCEFOR FUEL CYCLE FACILITIES</ITAG>I. IntroductionTeam assessments of operational safety at major fuel cycle facilities,which were conducted following the accidental release of uranium hexafluorideat Sequoyah Fuels Corporation in January 1986, identified management controlsas one of the most important issues needing attention by licensees. Inthe staff paper to the Commission (SECY-87-189), in which the team assessmentswere discussed, the staff concluded that fuel cycle licensees should specifymanagement controls programs covering all aspects of facility operations,including design and construction, procedures, maintenance, training, andaudits. The purpose of this Branch Technical Position is to describe amanagement controls/quality assurance program which licensees should useto improve operational safety.II. DiscussionThe purpose of management controls is to provide confidence that measurestaken to achieve safe, reliable facility operations remain effective andthat operations remain safe.This confidence will be obtained from a management controls program which:andbullet; Provides methods for seeking out and identifying items and activitiesimportant to safety and recognizes their potential significant failures.andbullet; Establishes procedures for tests and inspections, surveillance,and maintenance to provide protection against potential failures.andbullet; Provides feedback to confirm and verify program achievement andevaluates and assesses program effectiveness.The following are the essential items that should be included in the managementcontrols system. A discussion of each is provided.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Organization</ITAG>The organizational structure established by management for fuel cycle facilitiesshould provide for execution of the management controls functions.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Plant Safety Committee</ITAG>Management should establish a plant safety committee(s) or equivalent function,whose duties and responsibilities include matters such as review and approvalof operating plans and procedures, design changes, nonconformances andcorrective actions, audits, and training programs.(One of) the committees should have established procedures for systematicreview of proposed changes to procedures, equipment, tests, or processesto determine that such changes can be made by the licensee or whether NRCapproval is required.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Plant Procedures</ITAG>Licensees should have two basic types of procedures_administrative andgeneral plant procedures. Administrative procedures address the processof planning, administrative controls, and document issuance; and providerules and instructions on personnel conduct, preparation and retentionof plant documents, and interfaces among plant organizations. General plantprocedures prescribe the actions required to achieve safe operation andprovide instructions for the operation and maintenance of plant activitiesand support systems. General plant procedures should include measures forcontrolling chemical, radiological, nuclear criticality, and fire hazards.Licensees should provide management controls governing the establishment,maintenance, and use of all procedures.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Tests and Inspections </ITAG>Surveillance, tests, and inspections of items and activities importantto safety should be conducted in accordance with written procedures whichidentify requirements and acceptable limits. Pre-operational tests demonstrateplant operability and identify conditions adverse to safety. Tests duringoperations will verify and record the characteristics of various plantequipment and components. Surveillance, tests, and inspections, if required,should be performed to assure functionality of items and activities aftermodification or when corrective actions have been completed. Licenseesshould provide management controls governing the establishment, maintenance,and use of surveillance, tests, and inspections.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Audits </ITAG>Planned and scheduled internal and external audits should be performedto evaluate the application and effectiveness of management controls andimplementation of programs related to activities significant to plant safety.Audits should be conducted following approved procedures and instructions,and by qualified personnel who are not involved with the activity. Theaudit schedules and the audit personnel qualifications should be determinedby management. Audit results should be conducted and then reviewed by designated management.Deficient conditions requiring actions should be followed by management,and re-audited as necessary. Audit reports should be distributed to appropriatemanagement and organizations for review and information.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Training </ITAG>Training programs help to assure that employees have the necessary skillsand knowledge to perform the assigned duties safely. All employees shouldbe trained in their areas of responsibility and as applicable, in managementcontrols, nuclear criticality safety, radiological safety, chemical safety,and fire protection. Effectiveness of the training programs should be evaluatedperiodically.III. Position To assure confidence in the safe operation of fuel cycle facilities, thefollowing steps should be taken: A. Licensees should establish an organization responsible for developing,implementing, and assessing the management controls program for assuringsafe facility operation. B. Licensees should establish a plant safety committee(s) to monitor andoversee important plant activities and changes. The committee should include,as a minimum, management representatives from production, engineering,and safety functions. C. Licensees should develop written administrative and general plant procedures,including procedures for evaluating changes to procedures, equipment, tests,and processes. Such procedures should be reviewed, approved, and documentedin a manner approved by management. D. Licensees should establish and implement a surveillance, test, and inspectionprogram to assure satisfactory inservice performance of items and activitiesaffecting safety. Procedures which set forth the specified standards orcriteria and detailed testing steps should be developed. E. Licensees should provide for periodic independent audits to determinethe effectiveness of the management controls program. Management controlsshould provide for documentation of audit findings and implementation ofcorrective actions. F. Licensees should establish and implement training programs to provideemployees with the skills and knowledge to perform their jobs safely. Managementcontrols should provide for the evaluation of the effectiveness of trainingprograms against predetermined objectives and criteria.IV.

Introduction The Materials Safety Regulation Review Study Group (MSRRSG) recommendedthat the NRC expand its licensing and inspection procedures to ensure acomprehensive review of all aspects of fuel cycle licensees' activitiesimportant to safety. The MSRRSG concluded that this review should coverthe calibration, maintenance, and performance of all systems employed forachieving nuclear criticality safety, radiation safety, process safety,and confinement of radioactive or other hazardous materials. During the time that the MSRRSG report was being prepared, the staff conducteda number of team assessments of operational safety at the major fuel cyclefacilities under NRC jurisdiction. These assessments identified safety-relatedinstrumentation and maintenance as areas needing attention by licensees.Based on the MSRRSG recommendation and team assessment findings, a BranchTechnical Position on Requirements for Operation, which addresses instrumentationand controls and preventative maintenance and surveillance, has been developed.This position applies to all facility activities where nuclear criticalitysafety, radiation safety, process safety, and confinement of both hazardousand radioactive materials must be assured. Some licensees already utilize instrumentation and control systems andpreventative maintenance and surveillance programs to help assure safeoperations. The purpose of this Branch Technical Position is to addressthe use of these systems and programs and to assist all licensees in thedevelopment of comprehensive Requirements for Operation.II. Discussion Requirements for Operation are defined as instrumentation and control systemsand preventative maintenance and surveillance programs necessary for safeoperation of a facility to protect workers, the public health and safety,and the environment. Safety analyses of facility operations can be performedto identify both potential hazards and limiting specifications for theappropriate parameters of those operations which must be controlled. Instrumentationand control systems and/or preventative maintenance and surveillance programscan then be provided, and these systems and programs become the Requirementsfor Operation for the facility. Instrumentation and control systems provide the capability for monitoringoperational parameters that are important to safety. All instruments andcontrols required for safe operation should be failure-indicating or shouldbe backed up by other instruments and controls that can serve the samefunction. These systems also may initiate actions to help assure that acceptableoperating specifications are not exceeded. These actions may include automaticactivation of alarms, valves, ventilation dampers, or other safety-relatedequipment. Automatically activated systems should fail into a safe state.Preventative maintenance and surveillance programs provide means to monitoroperational parameters that are not suitable for direct control by instrumentationand control systems. Preventative maintenance and surveillance also areused to provide assurance that all instrumentation and control systemscontinue to function as required. Several examples to illustrate the development of Requirements for Operationfor typical facility operations and activities are described below. Theexamples include use of both instrumentation and control systems and preventativemaintenance and surveillance programs.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Process Systems </ITAG>A common process system is the conversion of low-enriched uranium hexafluoride(UF<T2>6</T2>) to uranyl fluoride (UO<T2>2</T2>F<T2>2</T2>) using steam. Two of the process safety controls are describedas Requirements for Operation. For purposes of nuclear criticality safety, the UO<T2>2</T2>F<T2>2</T2> must remain essentially dry (moderation control). To maintaindry conditions, condensation of steam in the presence of UO<T2>2</T2>F<T2>2</T2> must be prevented by introducing only superheated steam intothe preheated reaction vessel. Therefore, a Requirement for Operation isan instrumentation and control system to detect low steam or vessel temperatureand to automatically terminate flow of UF<T2>6</T2> and steam into the reaction vessel. For environmental protection, the UF<T2>6</T2> gas must be prevented from reaching and penetrating the processoff-gas system (filters). To accomplish this, the UF<T2>6</T2> gas introduced into the process vessel must be completely convertedto UO<T2>2</T2>F<T2>2</T2> powder. Therefore, a Requirement for Operation is an instrumentationand control system to detect a non-stoichiometric ratio of UF<T2>6</T2> to steam flows and to terminate flow of UF<T2>6</T2> and steam into the reaction vessel if an unsafe ratio is detected.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Auxiliary Chemical Systems </ITAG>An example of an auxiliary chemical system is the storage of chemicalssufficiently close to operations to create an uninhabitable environmentin the event of a tank rupture. To prevent tank rupture, the pressure ofthe tank must be controlled. Therefore, a Requirement for Operation isa pressure relief device to prevent rupture and/or to allow for controlledreleases. If other means to prevent tank rupture are not used, redundantsystems such as backup relief valves should be provided.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Fire Protection System</ITAG>Fire protection water should be available at all times to the facility.Both water pressure and flow are important to help assure that this wateris provided. Therefore, the Requirements for Operation are a low pressuredetection and alarm device and periodic water flow/pressure testing. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Ventilation and Effluent Control Systems </ITAG>Workers performing activities require protection against the inhalationof radioactive material (airborne contamination). For certain activities,a local exhaust hood with a face velocity sufficient to confine the airbornecontamination provides such protection. Requirements for Operation areperiodic measurement of the hood face velocity and administrative suspensionof the activity until the required face velocity is restored. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Utilities </ITAG>Power must be provided to certain safety systems at all times. An emergencygenerator is one way of assuring that power to the safety systems is maintainedif primary power is lost. Therefore, Requirments for Operation are periodicstartup tests and preventative maintenance of the emergency generator.III. Postion Licensees should perform safety analyses of facility operations to identifypotential hazards, operational parameters, and limiting specificationsfor these parameters. Based on the results of the safety analyses, licensees should establishand document the basis for Requirements for Operation. Licensees should establish programs for testing, calibration, and inspectionof all instrumentation and control systems to assure their reliability.Licensees should establish management controls to establish and monitorthe effectiveness of the Requirements for Operation programs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Branch Technical Position on Chemical Safety For Fuel Cycle Facilities</ITAG>I. IntroductionMost NRC fuel cycle licensees possess materials that are chemically hazardous,that pose some sort of non-radiological risk. In the past, the NRC hasbeen concerned mainly with radiological risks and has left the regulationof chemical risks to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and corresponding state-levelauthorities. While these agencies still have principal responsibility forchemical safety, several recent developments have led us to re-evaluatethe boundary between chemical and radiological safety and to reconsiderthe reach of the NRC's regulatory activities into the area of chemicalsafety.A fuller awareness has developed, particularly since the January 1986 accidentat the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation, that chemical and radiological riskscan compound one another and that in any case, many radioactive materialsare chemically hazardous. A chemical explosion in a fuel cycle facilitycould disperse radioactive material, just as the radiation environmentcould make it more difficult to respond to a hazardous chemical spill.In the Sequoyah accident, a uranium hexafluoride cylinder ruptured andexposed the cylinder's contents to water vapor in the air, leading to therelease of clouds of hydrofluoric acid vapor and uranyl fluoride particulates.The uranium hexafluoride and uranyl fluoride were radioactive, but themost serious problem was the release of highly corrosive hydrofluoric acidwhich, in fact, killed one worker. This is the best example of the typeof risk that this Branch Technical Position (BTP) aims to address.It has become clear that other federal and state agencies, even when havinglegal jurisdiction over chemical safety at fuel cycle facilities, are inpractice inclined to leave NRC licensees to the NRC. OSHA, for example,has responsibility for a huge number of workplaces but deploys only a modestnumber of inspectors. A draft Memorandum of Understanding between the NRCand OSHA recognizes this situation and makes provision for the NRC's inspectors,who visit all fuel cycle licensees regularly, to assume more responsibilityfor identifying unsafe working conditions and alerting the appropriateOSHA regional offices. A somewhat similar situation exists with regard to toxic wastes, air pollutants,and other environmentally-hazardous chemicals. EPA and its state-levelcounterparts have jurisdiction over these materials, but the NRC has moreof a presence in fuel cycle facilities and can help to ensure that themany federal environmental regualtions are followed. The Federal WaterPollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances ControlAct, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and LiabilityAct (a.k.a. ``Superfund''), and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-KnowAct have created a whole new framework for regulating the environmentalimpact of fuel cycle facilities, going far beyond the concentration limitsof 10 CFR Part 20 for radionuclides release to the environment. In the aftermath of the Sequoyah accident, the Materials Safety RegulationReview Study Group recommended that the NRC evaluate the scope of its regulatoryauthority over chemically-harardous substances and work with other responsibleagencies to ensure that there are no regulatory gaps. Four categories ofchemical risks were defined in order to clarify the NRC's responsibilities.The categories are:<ITAG tagnum="15">A. Radiation risk posed by radioactive materials, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">B. Chemical risk posed by radioactive Materials, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">C. Plant conditions that may directly or indirectly affect radiationrisk, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">D. Chemical risk posed by nonradioactive materials.</ITAG>The first three categories are the NRC's direct responsibility. NRC isnot the primary responsible agency for the fourth category and has no intentionof formulating regulations in this area, but will work with OSHA, EPA,and other agencies as appropriate, to help ensure that fuel cycle licenseesconform to all federal regulations. The purpose of this BTP is to describeactions to control the first three categories of risks.II DissussionThe four basic categories of risks listed in the Introduction require somefurther definition, both to help licensees better understand the materialsof concern in this BTP and to better match the risk categories with existingfederal regulations. The general category of ``chemcial risk,'' for example,can cover the risks posed by many different types of hazards. Some chemicalspose a risk to workers; others pose an environmental risk; some pose both.Some chemical risks could have acute consequences, such as a worker dyingin a fire or explosion. Other risks could have chronic consequences, suchas a worker suffering health effects from long-term exposure to a carcinogenicmaterial. The following paragraphs define categories of risks, suggestsome practical examples from fuel cycle facilities, and identify applicablefederal regulations to which licensees are subject. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Radiation Risks Posed by Radioactive Materials </ITAG>These risks are already explicitly subject to NRC regulation and are nota subject of this BTP. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Chemical Risks Posed by Radioactive Materials </ITAG>One type of chemical risk posed by radioactive materials is the risk thata radioactive material may be the cause of a severe chemical accident.This would cover risks posed by radioactive materials that are explosive,flammable, highly reactive, or handled under high temperatures or pressures.An example would be the risks involved in handling uranium hexafluoridecylinders. Uranium hexafluoride is a highly reactive chemical known toreact rapidly with water, inlcuding the water vapor in normal air, to producehazardous hydrofluoric acid vapors and uranyl fluroride particulates. Anaccidental release of uranium hexafluoride would pose an acute threat tothe safety of nearby workers. Uranium hexafluoride is normally stored andtransported in airtight cylinders. The tendency of uranium hexafluorideto expand dramatically when heated means that a cylinder filled beyondnormal limits poses a significant danger of rupture or explosion, whichcould cause direct injury to workers in addition to releasing hazardousgases. Another radioactive material that could pose chemical risks of this typeis uranyl nitrate. Uranyl nitrate is normally in a strong solution of nitricacid, so a spill could cause serious acid burns or, if a strong base isstored nearby, lead to violently exothermic reactions. Furthermore, whenuranyl nitrate is overheated it can release toxic nitrogen oxides. NRC is the principal agency responsible for the safety of radioactive materialshandled in fuel cycle facilities, whether radiation safety or chemicalsafety. But some existing federal regulations on chemical safety may beapplicable to radioactive materials. OSHA regulations in 29 CFR 1910, 101-.120cover safety procedures that should be followed in handling flammable liquids,compressed gases, and some other types of hazardous materials. A second type of chemical risk could be posed by the chemical toxicityof some radioactive materials. The concern of this BTP is the possibilitythat some radioactive compounds may be more toxic because of their non-radioactivecomponents than because of the radioactivity. For example, 10 CFR Part20 limits for soluble natural uranium are based on its chemical toxicity.Insoluble natural uranium is less toxic chemically, and the 10 CFR Part20 exposure limits for insoluble natural uranium are based on its radiationhazards. Many chemicals are more hazardous than insoluble uranium as airbornetoxins, and a few are more hazardous even than soluble uranium. If thesechemicals were present in radioactive compounds, the airborne exposurelimits of 10 CFR Part 20 could well be less stringent than existing federalregulations on occupational exposure to airborne chemicals, such as 29CFR 1910.1000.A third type of chemical risk would be the risk to the environment or topublic health and safety posed by a large, accidental release of a radioactivematerial with dangerous chemical properties. The radiation hazards arisingfrom an accidental release of radioactive material are covered by existingNRC regulations, but in some cases, the chemical properties of the releasedsubstance may pose more of a risk than its radiation properties. For example,an accidental release of uranium hexafluoride would generate a plume ofhydrofluoric acid when the uranium hexafluoride reacts wtih airborne watervapor. The hydrofluoric acid would probably be a greater hazard to nearbyresidents than uranyl fluroide, the radioactive byproduct of the accident.As another example, a spill of solvent extraction organic (normally a solutionof tri-butyl phosphate in dodecane) could cause serious local water pollutionunrelated to the amount of uranium it contains. Existing EPA regulations would apply to an accidental release of chemicallyhazardous radioactive materials. 40 CFR Parts 116-117, derived from theFederal Water Pollution Control Act of 1978, identifies chemicals thatcan be hazardous water pollutants and establishes requirements for reportingreleases to the EPA. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations, 40 CFRParts 702-799, would govern licensees handling certain types of toxic chemicals.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Plant Conditions Which May Directly Or Indirectly Affect RadiationRisk </ITAG>This category of risk covers plant conditions related to the presence ofhazardous chemicals on or near a fuel cycle site that could affect radiationsafety. One concern would be the risk posed by the presence of flammableor explosive chemicals near radioactive materials or near essential facilitiesfor the control and containment of radioactive materials. If a flammableor explosive chemical were involved in an accident under these circumstances,the dispersal of radioactive material or loss of control over radioactivematerial could make the accident much more serious than would otherwisebe the case. This concern would apply not only to flammable or explosivechemicals that are possessed by the fuel cycle licensee, but also to suchchemicals in the possession of others that are located sufficiently closeto the fuel cycle facility, such that a major fire or explosion could affectthe safety of licensed material. The safety regulations of 29 CFR Part 1910 would apply to the storage andhandling of flammable or explosive materials, but the possibility thatradioactive materials could be involved in a fire or explosion would haveto be reflected in a fuel cycle licensee's emergency plan and operatortraining procedures. Risks may also be posed by the proximity of toxic chemicals or inert gasesto essential areas of a fuel cycle facility. Accidental release of suchchemicals could render the control room, the emergency operations center,or other essential areas uninhabitable. NRC Regulatory Guide 1.78 discussesthe precautions that would be appropriate for protecting a reactor controlroom from hazardous chemical fumes. Similar considerations shoud be appliedto fuel cycle licensees. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Chemical Risks Posed by Nonradioactive Materials. </ITAG>Chemical risks at fuel cycle facilities that do not involve radioactivematerials either directly or indirectly are strictly considered to be subjectto EPA or OSHA regulations, not NRC regulations. These hazards are notthe subject of this BTP. The Memorandum of Understanding with OSHA indicatesthat, in the future, NRC inspectors will make more of an effort than previouslyto assess licensee compliance with OSHA regulations and to inform OSHAof possible incidences of noncompliance. III. Position To help ensure that chemical hazards do not endanger the safety of workersor members of the general public, the following steps should be taken byfuel cycle facility licensees: A. Licensees should identify all chemical risks of the types discussedin Sections II. B and C above, which are posed by materials in their facilitiesor in the vicinity of their facilities. Licensees should determine thequantities of all the chemicals identified. For purposes of making a complete identification, hazardous chemicals shouldbe considered to be any included in the following sources:<ITAG tagnum="16">29 CFR 1910.101-.120 for flammable and explosive materials, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">29 CFR 1910.1000-.1500 for occupational toxins, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">40 CFR Parts 116-117 for substances hazardous if accidentally releasedinto the environment, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">40 CFR Parts 702-799 for toxic substances subject to the 1982 ToxicSubstances Control Act, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">40 CFR 261.31-.33 for hazardous wastes, and Material Safety Data Sheets.</ITAG>B. Licensees should determine that proper facilities, equipment, and proceduresare employed for the safe storage and handling of all hazardous chemicalsin their possession. All operators should be trained in procedures forthe safe handling and disposal of hazardous chemicals in the licensee'spossession. C. Licensees should determine that proper procedures are in place and properfacilities and equipment are available for measuring the extent of, mitigatingthe consequences of, and otherwise dealing with any potential accidentalrelease of hazardous chemicals. These procedures, facilities, and equipmentshould be described in the licensee's emergency plan. Procedures shouldbe in place for notifying the EPA and any responsible state or local agenciesof such a release. All operators should be trained in procedures for respondingto an emergency involving hazardous chemicals. Licensees should determinethat proper procedures are in place and that proper facilities and equipmentare available for dealing with a release of radioactive material causedby fire, explosion, or other accident with nonradioactive materials. Theseprocedures, facilities, and equipment should be described in the licensee'semergency plan. Accidents involving hazardous nonradioactive materialslocated or transported nearby but not on the fuel cycle site should alsobe considered, even if such materials are not in the possession of thelicensee. The proximity of major depots of hazardous chemicals should beconsidered in evaluating the possible impact on hazardous chemicals onthe safe operation of the fuel cycle facility. The management controls, conditions required for operation, and fire protectionmeasures discussed in other BTPs may be used to help accomplish these chemicalsafety goals. <ITAG tagnum="84">Branch Technical Position on Fire Protection for Fuel Cycle Facilities</ITAG>I. Introduction Any application for a license to possess and use licensed materials ina fuel cycle facility must provide information showing that the applicant'sproposed equipment, facilities, and procedures are adequate to protecthealth and minimize danger to life or property. In the area of fire protection,the staff has in the past generally accepted compliance with local buildingcodes and proof of insurance as sufficient fire protection informationfor approval of license applications. In addition, ad hoc measures havebeen taken in response to the staff's inspection findings relating to specificfacilities. Following the January 4, 1986, accident at the Sequoyah Fuels Corporationuranium hexafluoride conversion facility, however, the NRC undertook amajor review of the operational safety of fuel cycle facilities. Both therecommendations of the Materials Safety Regulation Review Study Group andthe independent staff action to assess operational safety at each of 12major fuel cycle facilities licensed by the NRC led the staff to the findingthat fire protection is one of the most important safety concerns. This finding, coupled with the experience of the applicants and the staffin their respective roles of operation and of regulation of fuel cyclefacilities, permits the formulation of this Branch Technical Position (BTP),which should provide guidance to the applicants on meeting the approvalrequirements of NRC regulations insofar as fire protection is concerned.The objective of this BTP is to provide guidelines for a fire protectionprogram at each fuel cycle facility that would be acceptable to the staffas having the necessary elements to ensure protection of health and tominimize danger to life and property. These guidelines should not be consideredall-inclusive, and nothing should preclude a licensee from adopting a programthat is prudent and employs the latest techniques of fire protection thatmeet or exceed the guidance in this BTP. II. Discussion <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Fire Protection Concept </ITAG>Accidental fires and consequent explosions, apart from being threats tohealth, life, and property by themselves, are potential causes of unplannedradioactive releases at a fuel cycle facility. The concept of fire protectionpresented by this BTP consists of implementing measures to achieve a balanceamong the following desired results: andbullet; Prevention of fires; andbullet; Detection of fires; and andbullet; Containment and suppression of fires. A discussion of these three levels of fire protection follows: <T3>1. Fire prevention</T3>: Fire prevention measures at a fuel cycle facilityshould start with the design of the buildings, structures, systems, components,and processes involved in the storage, handling, and processing of theradioactive materials and chemicals used in the processes. The processesshould be designed and physically laid out so as to minimize the possibilityof overheating, over-pressurization, and leakage; and the confluence ofcombustibles and ignition sources except by design. Even with the mostwell-designed facility, prevention of fires depends to a great extent onfollowing good housekeeping practices and operating personnel scrupulouslyfollowing safety instructions. <T3>2. Fire detection: </T3>The best fire prevention measures may occasionallyfail, in which case an effective fire detection system should detect theoccurrence of fire and activate alarm systems so that personnel evacuationand fire containment and suppression measures may start promptly. The typeand location of the detectors depends on the type of hazard.<T3>3. Containment and suppression of fire: </T3>Containment of fire inits area of origin and prevention of its spread to new areas and new combustiblesis the first step to be taken upon detection of a fire. This is achievedby activating systems such as barriers, ventilation dampers, exhaust fans,and drainage pumps to prevent migration of gases, hot combustion products,and flammable liquids to new areas. Fire suppression activity should startat the same time as barrier systems are activated. The media employed inthe suppression and the means of their delivery to the fire source andto heated areas and substances depends on the plant area and the processesand equipment protected. The concerns for nuclear criticality safety, chemicalsafety, and the danger to personnel from non-life supporting extinguishingmedia such as carbon dioxide, should all be taken into account in planninga fire suppression system.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Building Construction</ITAG>Buildings, structures, components, and processes in a fuel cycle facilityshould be designed to protect the health of plant personnel and the publicand minimize the danger to life and property during normal operation, aswell as during abnormal situations such as fires and explosions. The followingdiscussion lists desirable features in the design and construction of afacility. It is recognized, however, that a number of fuel cycle facilitiesalready exist and are in operation, and these facilities may not have allof the desirable design and construction features.1. The buildings should be designed and constructed using components ofnoncombustible and heat and fire resistant materials, as far as practicable.Assuming failure of a fixed fire suppression system, the structural barriers(including walls, roofs, floors, doors, and penetrations) surrounding aplant area of high hazard of fire should be constructed so as to confinethe effluents of fire for a sufficient duration for fire suppression measuresto be applied. Such structural barriers should also possess adequate fireratings so as not to propagate fire to adjoining areas. ASTM Standard E-119,``Fire Test of Building Construction and Materials,'' which defines fireratings, ASTM Standard E-84, ``Surface Burning Characteristics of BuildingMaterials,'' and local and national building codes may be consulted.2. Suspended ceilings and their supports, insulation for pipes and ducts,and sound-attenuating materials should be non-combustible and should nothinder effective functioning of the fire suppression system. Concealedspaces should be devoid of combustibles, as far as practicable.3. Electrical wiring and their supporting components such as conduits andcable trays, servicing essential components, including fire protectionsystems, should be protected against fire. Non-fire propagating insulatedelectrical cables should be used in areas of high fire hazard, as far aspracticable.4. Provision should be made for protection of the plant from lightningdamage.5. Exits from the various plant areas should be strategically located soas to facilitate orderly evacuation of personnel, with minimum exposureto fire products and radioactive releases.6. The plant areas should be designed so that fire fighting personnel alongwith their equipment may access them with minimum hindrance.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Ventilation System</ITAG>The ventilation system should be designed to isolate affected areas duringfire accidents and to provide channels for exhausting fire products, throughfilters if necessary, to outside the plant. NFPA Standard 90-A, ``Air Conditioningand Ventilation Systems,'' may be consulted on ventilation design for fireprotection.Where a ventilation system is required to prevent the release of radioactivematerial to the atmosphere, all materials of construction and all filtersfor the system should be fire resistant. High efficiency HEPA filters shouldconform with Underwriters' Laboratories Standard UL-586, also designatedANSI B 132.1.If a heat removal system such as a water spray system is required for thefinal filter plenum, it should operate automatically (with manual override)upon abnormal rise of the effluent temperature. The water distributionsystem for the water spray system should be in addition to and separatefrom the fire water distribution system. Provision should be made for periodicoperational performance checks of such systems.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Fire Detection and Alarm Systems</ITAG>1. Provision should be made for fire detection and alarm systems consistingof fire and smoke detectors, signalling devices, and audible and visibleindicators of fire at various appropriate locations in the plant, as wellas at a central constantly attended monitoring station. Such monitoringstations should constantly have available information on the status andfunctioning of the fire detection and alarm systems and of the installedfire suppression systems, including a zone indication of the origin ofan alarm. Provision should be made for the periodic testing of these systems.Fire detection systems should comply with the requirements of Class A systemsas defined in NFPA 72D, ``Standard for the Installation, Maintenance, andUse of Proprietary Protective Signalling Systems,'' and NFPA 72E, ``AutomaticFire Detectors.''2. Manual fire alarm actuators should be installed throughout the plantat locations which are readily accessible, including exit passageways.3. Actuation of any fire suppression system, such as flow through a sprinkler,should initiate visual and audible alarms.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Fire Suppression Systems</ITAG>Manually actuated or automatic fire suppression systems should be installedin all plant areas having significant fire hazard. The selection of a specifictype of system should take into account the severity of the hazard, typeof activity performed in the area, nuclear criticality concerns, consequencesof fire (e.g., risk of radioactive release), and consequences of spuriousactuation of the suppression system. Provisions should be made for theperiodic testing of the systems. The following subsections provide generalguidance on the selection of a system:1. Automatic water sprinkler coverage should be provided in areas of significantfire hazard, except where nuclear criticality or other hazards specificallyobviate their use. NFPA 13, Installation of Sprinkler Systems, providesguidance for selection and design of sprinkler systems.2. Plant areas having significant fire hazard and not protected by automaticwater sprinkler systems should be protected by other systems employingfire suppression agents such as inert gases, carbon dioxide, halogenatedhydrocarbon gases, and high-expansion foam. Guidance on carbon dioxideand halon systems are provided in NFPA 12 and 12A, respectively. Guidanceon the selection and design of foam systems are provided in NFPA 11 and11A.3. Selection of all gaseous suppression systems should take into accountprotection of personnel, possible pressurization of the enclosure protected,and possible adverse reaction with pyrophoric materials.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Manual Fire Fighting Equipment</ITAG>1. Portable fire extinguishers, suitable in capacity and in the type ofsuppression agent used, should be available throughout the plant wherespecific types of fire hazards exist. The number of such extinguishersand their location should be guided by the severity of the hazard, theoccupancy of the plant area, and ready access in an emergency. Guidanceon the selection and use of portable fire extinguishers is provided inNFPA 10.2. Standpipe and hose systems should be provided for the protection ofall process and non-process areas. The hose outlet locations should bereadily accessible. Guidance on standpipe and hose systems is providedin NFPA 14. <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Fire Protection Water System </ITAG>1. Adequate supply of water for the installed fire protection systems shouldbe assured. Additional supply of fire fighting water that may be neededby an outside fire department should be planned for in consultation withthem. Compatible connections should be provided for outside fire departmentuse. The fire water distribution system should be designed and constructedfor high reliability. NFPA 24, Standard for the Installation of PrivateFire Service Mains and Their Appurtenances, should be used for guidance.2. A collection system should be provided for the drainage of water usedin fire suppression and fire fighting. Nuclear criticality concerns, sampling,confinement, and retrievability of the drainage should be taken into accountin the design and construction of the system. <ITAG tagnum="81">H. Emergency Lighting and Communications </ITAG>1. To facilitate evacuation and fire fighting in the event of a power failure,provision should be made for emergency lighting powered by an alternatesource. 2. An emergency communication system, including portable transceivers,should be provided. <ITAG tagnum="81">I. Training </ITAG>In order to extract maximum benefit from a well/designed fire protectionsystem, the personnel monitoring and operating the system should be trained.The training for non-fire fighting personnel usually takes the form ofdrills to ensure orderly evacuation, use of hand-held fire extinguishersand fire alarm devices, and the importance of good housekeeping. Facilityemployees assigned fire fighting duties, such as members of an organizedfire brigade, should receive appropriate training. NFPA 1001, Fire FighterProfessional Qualifications, may be consulted for guidance as to the elementsof the training. Local fire department personnel who may be summoned tofight fires in the facility should be provided orientation training onthe facility and its processes. Whenever practicable, facility fire fightingpersonnel also should receive training with the local fire department infire fighting methods. <ITAG tagnum="81">J. Fire Emergency Plans </ITAG>Fire emergency plans should be drawn up in consultation with the localfire departments, taking into account those departments' existing equipment,distances from the plant, and their training in fighting fires involvingradioactive materials and chemicals in the facility. III. Position <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Fire Protection Program </ITAG>Licensees should establish and maintain a fire protection program for thefacility. The overall management of the program should be under the directionof a senior level individual, who has been given the authority and staffassistance to implement measures relating to fire protection throughoutthe facility. The program should include provisions for audits of the effectivenessof the program. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Fire Protection Equipment </ITAG>The selection, installation, and use of the fire protection equipment andsystems should be appropriate for the plant area protected and should conformwith or exceed the requirements of NFPA and other national codes and standardscited above (see B. Discussion) and also those cited in the references.The equipment should be maintained and tested periodically, as appropriate,to ensure reliability of operation in an emergency. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Fire Hazard Analysis </ITAG>For both existing and new facilities, licensees should perform a fire hazardanalysis for each plant area and for the facility as a whole. This analysisshould account for the combustible and the radioactive materials in thearea, their heat content, the processes performed in the areas that havepotential for fire or explosion, and the potential sources of ignition.It should consider credible scenarios by which a fire can occur and thecapabilities of installed fire suppression systems, portable extinguishers,and other fire fighting measures that the management may summon (e.g.,outside fire departments). The objective of a fire hazard analysis wouldbe to detect deficiencies in the fire protection program or otherwise todemonstrate that the facility has in operation fire protection systems,that can handle all credible fire scenarios. The fire hazard analysis shouldbe periodically reviewed and updated as necessary. Any deficiencies identifiedas a result of an analysis should be corrected by a judicious balance offacility modification and enhanced fire protection measures. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Fire Emergency Plans </ITAG>Licensees should establish fire emergency plans for each area of the facility.Such plans assign responsibilities to individuals and include measuresto ensure orderly evacuation of personnel, shutting down operations, activatingbarrier systems, summoning fire fighters, controlling small fires, andcontrolling release of radioactive material. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Training </ITAG>Licensees should have a training program for an adequate number of personnelto perform assigned duties during a fire emergency. This program also shouldprovide for periodic retraining and drills. Evacuation drills should beconducted for all facility personnel. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Administrative Controls </ITAG>Licensees should establish fire safety procedures aimed at minimizing firehazards such as for transit and storage of combustibles in the plant, generalhousekeeping, and maintenance work such as welding and torch cutting.
