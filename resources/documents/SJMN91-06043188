Penney -- that have signed on with Maryland-based Rouse Co. to create agiant retail plaza in downtown Oakland.;    But financing for what could be a$360 million construction job has not yet been found, and Emporium may now bein no condition to contribute to the project.;    &quot;The assumption is (CarterHawley Hale) will be able to somehow continue long term, but maybe not,&quot; saidAlbert Aguiar, a retail marketing consultant. &quot;If Carter Hawley Hale saidwe're going to go out of business, that would be a pretty substantial blow todowntown Oakland.&quot;;    City officials were cautious Monday about the impact ofthe retailer's troubles.;    &quot;We're simply looking at it now as a legalprocess that they need to go through in order to get some breathing space . .. and hopefully come back stronger,&quot; said Mona Lombard, a spokeswoman for theOakland Office of Economic Development and Employment. &quot;We're hoping that if(the chain does) remain open, that Oakland would remain one of the stores theyinclude.&quot;;    A Carter Hawley Hale spokesman would not discuss what Monday'sfiling would mean for the Emporium's future in Oakland.;    Already, Emporium,as Oakland's lone major department store, contributes an important portion ofthe city's sales tax base. But the store is equally significant as a partnerin the proposed Rouse project -- seen as the key to downtown's turnaround.;   Nordstrom officials have said they will build a store only if there are threeother major retailers in the project.;    &quot;There really could be a dominoeffect if (Emporium leaves),&quot; Aguiar said.;    But Robert Kahn, a Lafayetteretail industry consultant, said he wasn't as concerned.;    &quot;Since (the Rouseproject) is three or four years off, you have to wait and see what happens inthe bankruptcy,&quot; he said. &quot;It may very well be that Carter Hawley Hale comesout of this Chapter 11 healthy, healthier than it is today.&quot;;    Rouseofficials did not return calls for comment.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BARRY WITT, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Oakland  </CITY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910212  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  399  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday February 12, 199100043188,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
