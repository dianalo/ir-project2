(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim and Tammy Bakker say salary figuresused by the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of PTL wereexaggerated, and in any case it is not up to the government to setsalaries for ministers.   ``Grossly inflated figures have been given for our personalincome and then used by the PTL trustee to continue to discreditus,'' Bakker said in a news release sent from his home in PalmSprings, Calif.   The IRS revoked PTL's tax-exempt status Friday and saidcontributions to the financially troubled television ministry areno longer tax deductible. An IRS report in December concluded thatthe Bakkers and their aides profited excessively from donationsmade to the ministry.   ``Whether you agree on how much we should or should not havebeen paid, never before in history has the federal government setthe salary of a minister of the gospel,'' Bakker said. ``Just asnever to my knowledge has the United States government appointedthe head of a church ministry, as it has now done at PTL.''   The Bakkers apparently were referring to David Clark, thecourt-appointed bankruptcy trustee for PTL.   ``I could not believe when I heard the trustee say on a recentPTL telecast that my income alone for 1987 was $2,977,018, when infact, Tammy and I together took home $200,554 from PTL that year.In the last three years, he said we made over $8,000,000, when,according to our accountant, together we took home an average of$531,000 per year for those three years _ 1985, 1986 and 1987,''Bakker said.   Bakker also disputed the Internal Revenue Service's conclusionthat much of PTL's Heritage USA theme park operations werecommercial, rather than ministerial.   The Bakkers also repeated that they wanted to return to save theministry they founded. They left the ministry following revelationsof a sexual encounter between Jim Bakker and a former churchsecretary.   On April 15, when PTL officials told him they couldn't raise the$5.7 million needed by May 7 to comply with the bankruptcyreorganization plan, Judge Rufus Reynolds said, ``It looks like theend of the road'' for the ministry.   ``It's definitely a liquidation,'' said Reynolds, the federalbankruptcy judge who is handling the case. ``It's just a matter ofhow orderly a liquidation.''</TEXT></DOC>
