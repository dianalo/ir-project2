A mine exploded 90 minutes later on a railroad line about a milefrom the three-story hotel, slightly wounding two more people, saidofficials at the Windhoek State Hospital.   The explosions occurred on the day the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization said it would begin a voluntary cease-fire.SWAPO has fought a long guerrilla war against South African controlof the territory, also known as Namibia.   South Africa's government-run broadcasting network said ananonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility for the hotelbombing on behalf of SWAPO. The guerrilla group normally attacksmilitary targets or white residential or shopping areas.   Louis Pienaar, the territorial administrator appointed by SouthAfrica, blamed SWAPO and accused it of violating the pledge of atruce. He did not explain why the guerrillas would bomb a hotelpatronized by blacks.   SWAPO and other black groups have warned of a possible whitebacklash in Namibia because of preliminary South African proposalsfor independence elections that probably would result in governmentby the black majority.   The Continental Hotel was severely damaged by the explosion atabout 7 p.m. Witnesses said several parked cars were hurled acrossthe street.   Firefighters needed more than 90 minutes to bring the blazeunder control, The explosion apparently occurred near the hotelentrance, witnesses said.   Police spokesman Kerri du Rand said officials feared thebuilding could collapse. He said one black man and one white manwere killed, but he did not comment on the races of those injured.   A correspondent for the South African Broadcasting Corp. at thescene said the bombing was ``one of the biggest explosions Windhoekhas experienced.''   SWAPO has said its guerrillas would stop launching attacks inthe territory as of Thursday as their contribution to a regionalpeace initiative.   South African commanders have not formally endorsed the trucebut have said their forces will not initiate offensive actionagainst SWAPO.   SWAPO has been fighting since 1966 in a bid to win independencefor South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.   On Tuesday, South Africa said it has pulled all its troops outof Angola, where it was fighting alongside rebels in their battleagainst Angola's Marxist government and its Cuban allies. SouthAfrica, Cuba and Angola had been observing a cease-fire in Angolasince Aug. 8.   SWAPO was not included in peace talks involving those threecountries and U.S. mediators, and is not bound by any of theagreements they have reached.   The South African military reported Tuesday it had killed 14SWAPO insurgents the previous week and that the guerrilla groupshad launched several sabotage attacks. But the military said therewere no new attacks reported Thursday.   The South African military has said it expects Angola to use itsinfluence to keep SWAPO rebels at least 150 miles north of theNamibian border. SWAPO has not said publicly if it will abide.   SWAPO has its main bases in southern Angola, from which itlaunches attacks into northern Namibia.   South Africa has administered Namibia for 73 years, despiterepeated United Nations resolutions since 1966 calling forindependence in the territory.   South Africa says it will begin withdrawing from Namibia on Nov.1 and allow the territory to hold independence elections June 1 ifCuba pulls its 50,000 troops out of Angola by the latter date.   Several rounds of peace talks have failed to achieve a mutuallyacceptable date for Namibian independence and the complete Cubanwithdrawal from Angola. More talks are planned Monday inBrazzaville, Congo.</TEXT></DOC>
