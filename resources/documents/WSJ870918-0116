StewartStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., who faces the threat of a federal indictment for insider trading, has retained as co-counsel former U.S. Attorney Robert B. Fiske Jr., a partner at Davis Polk andamp; Wardwell. The move surprised some other lawyers involved in what promises to be the first major trial in Wall Street's unfolding insider-trading scandal.    Until now, Mr. Freeman's lead lawyer had been another former U.S. attorney, Paul Curran, a partner at Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays andamp; Handler. Mr. Curran will remain as co-counsel, the first time in recent memory that two former U.S. attorneys have shared the same client.    Mr. Freeman, of course, is no ordinary client. Not only is he a leading figure on Wall Street, but his fate is inextricably tied to the well-being of Goldman Sachs, one of the Street's most prestigious securities firms.    Insider-trading charges against Mr. Freeman and two former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. arbitragers, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor, were dismissed in May after the government's request for more time in the case was denied. It was the first major embarrassment for the government in its campaign against insider trading. But government prosecutors have vowed to seek a new indictment of the three arbitragers that would contain broader charges. Goldman Sachs and the three men have denied any wrongdoing.    Mr. Fiske is expected to function as lead counsel, even though one person close to Goldman Sachs said that &quot;we're going to let the two of them work out their relationship.&quot; Others close to Mr. Freeman's defense team have tried to defuse widespread speculation that Mr. Curran is being pushed aside. &quot;People at Goldman Sachs, and Bob Freeman are entirely satisfied with Paul's performance,&quot; said one person involved in the case. It would be &quot;entirely unfair&quot; to speculate that Mr. Curran's status was being diminished, he added.    Why, then, the addition of one of New York's leading criminal defense lawyers? Some people close to Goldman Sachs said that there were reservations within Goldman Sachs about Mr. Curran's expertise in criminal securities matters. &quot;In a life-and-death situation, you want the best,&quot; said one person close to Goldman Sachs.    Indeed, Goldman Sachs earlier approached Mr. Fiske for Mr. Freeman's defense, but was rebuffed because Mr. Fiske was already representing former Kidder Peabody chairman Ralph D. DeNunzio, whose role in the scandal has also been under investigation. Mr. DeNunzio hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing. People familiar with the matter said Mr. DeNunzio has waived any conflict-of-interest objections to having Mr. Fiske represent Mr. Freeman.    Other criminal lawyers are skeptical that the defense of Mr. Freeman can accommodate two generals of such stature as Messrs. Fiske and Curran. &quot;It can't work,&quot; said one. &quot;How can you have two former U.S. attorneys with one client?&quot;    Mr. Fiske, who was in Washington yesterday for testimony on Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, declined to comment. He was appointed Manhattan U.S. attorney by President Ford and served in that post until 1980, personally trying cases against heroin trafficker Leroy &quot;Nicky&quot; Barnes and labor figure Anthony M. Scotto. Since returning to Davis Polk, he defended Babcock andamp; Wilcox in litigation arising from the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster and was co-counsel for the National Football League in the antitrust suit filed by the U.S. Football League.    Mr. Curran, who had been Manhattan U.S. attorney from 1973 to 1975, said he was &quot;delighted&quot; by the move. He and Mr. Fiske will &quot;share responsibility&quot; for the case, he said. &quot;I'm not being pushed aside,&quot; he added. &quot;There is plenty of work in this matter.&quot;    The addition of Mr. Fiske isn't expected to produce any dramatic change in Mr. Freeman's defense strategy. Still, &quot;a fresh eye&quot; on the matter &quot;can often lead to a different view of the case,&quot; said one criminal lawyer. And some observers noted that Kidder Peabody's addition of criminal lawyer Gary Naftalis led to a settlement of insider-trading and other charges against the firm without any criminal charges being filed. Kidder is a unit of General Electric Co.    People close to Goldman Sachs, however, said there has been no talk of a settlement with the government with respect to Mr. Freeman or the firm. </TEXT></DOC>
