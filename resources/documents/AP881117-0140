An official at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said theState Department confirmed two Afghan diplomats did not return tothe Afghan capital of Kabul, but would not say more about theirwhereabouts. He spoke on condition of anonymity.   Other U.S. officials, also speaking on condition of anonymity,confirmed both diplomats had defected to the United States.   No spokesmen were available at Afghanistan's Mission to theUnited Nations. A receptionist said they were out of the office.   Sources at the United Nations said the defectors were a deputyforeign minister named Lanikwal, and a diplomat named Kamal.   Afghan Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Sharq was in New York lastweek for talks with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar andother officials.   In April, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed a U.N.-mediated accordin Geneva, with the United States and Soviet Union signing asguarantors.   Under the accord, the Soviet army began withdrawing fromAfghanistan on May 15, with half of their about 100,000 troops outin August.   The Soviet Foreign Ministry said early this month that it has``suspended'' the withdrawal because of attacks by U.S.- andPakistan-backed guerrillas, who have rejected the pact.   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
