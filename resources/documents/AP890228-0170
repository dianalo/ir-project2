Panicked children aged 4 to 10, some with blood streaming downtheir faces, ran screaming and sobbing from the school, a teachersaid. A blackboard in one classroom still listed Tuesday's subjectfor discussion: ``The War.''   Five of the children were critically hurt when rockets explodedwithin 25 yards of their school, only yards from a guerrilla base.In addition, eight other people were wounded in the raid on thebases by six fighter-bombers.   The guerrilla casualties were members of the Democratic Front forthe Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist group that is part of thePalestine Liberation Organization, said a police spokesman, whocannot be identified under briefing rules.   Five of the wounded were militiamen of the leftist DruseProgressive Socialist Party. They were manning a post near Ainab, amountain village 9{ miles southeast of Beirut.   The air strike coincided with the front's 20th anniversary andcame five days after the guerrilla group lost three fighters in anattack on Israeli-backed militiamen in south Lebanon.   The spokesman said the Israeli warplanes struck at 11:28 a.m. andalso hit bases belonging to Syrian-backed guerrilla factions nearthe Druse villages of Shemlan, Aitat and Baysour.   The fighter-bombers swooped down through clear skies for at leastthree bomb and rocket runs in what an Israeli military spokesman inJerusalem said was a raid on a headquarters of the front.   Palestinian, Druse and Shiite Moslem fighters fired anti-aircraftguns at the raiders from positions in the mountains and aroundBeirut airport, but no hits were reported.   ``All our planes returned safely, and the targets weredestroyed,'' the Israeli spokesman said.   The children were wounded by shrapnel and glass shards when tworockets exploded within 25 yards of Ainab's government-sponsoredelementary school on the second floor of a two-story house.   In one classroom, the youngsters were discussing the war as partof Tuesday's lesson when the jets screamed in, an instructor said.   ``All of a sudden glass started spraying the room,'' said teacherRaja Jaber, who suffered head wounds. ``There was panic everywhere.The children started screaming as blood streamed down their faces.One of them cried, `Miss, it hurts!'   The tree-ringed guerrilla base _ a two-story stone house and twoolive-green tents _ took several direct hits.   Suheil Natour, a spokesman for the front, told The AssociatedPress the guerrilla faction will ``step up ... military strikesagainst Israel's occupation forces.''   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said the front's attackThursday was ``another example of the inability of the PLO tofulfill its declared statement of stopping terror.''   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said in Washingtonthat the Thursday incident and Israel's air strike underscored aneed for security arrangements to protect Israelis and Lebanese.   ``We deplore the loss of life and needless suffering of innocentpeople on both sides,'' he said.   The U.S. designated contact with the PLO, Ambassador RobertPelletreau, criticized the Thursday raid as having a negative impacton the 2-month-old U.S.-PLO dialogue and on prospects forIsrael-Palestinian talks.   However, Redman said the State Department is still examiningwhether the Thursday raid showed PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat brokehis promise in December not to engage in terrorism, which led theUnited States to begin direct meetings with the PLO.   The Israelis have charged that guerrilla raids launched sincethen have undermined that declaration. The PLO says Arafat'srenunciation of terrorism does not include halting attacks onmilitary targets in Israel or Israeli-occupied territory.   The Israeli raid was the third on targets in Lebanon this year.By police count, at least 128 people were killed and 356 wounded in25 Israeli air raids on Lebanon last year. There were no casualtiesreported in the two raids earlier this year.   In Beirut, rival Lebanese military forces on both sides of thedividing Green Line on Tuesday reopened a crossing linking theChristian and Moslem sectors that was closed for five years.Pedestrians and motorists streamed across the Port Crossing, whichzigzags through the war-ravaged harbor area.   Two other crossings in the center of Beirut have long been chokedby traffic and three other gateways in downtown Beirut and itseastern suburbs remain closed.</TEXT></DOC>
