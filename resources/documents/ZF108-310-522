 The program facilitates the users' login and provides themwith menu choices for executing applications, DOS commands, or shelling toDOS with an minimum of 7.8K of overhead.andP;  Keyboard security is alsoavailable.andM;Requirements: Menu Manager claims to support any version of NetWare and DOS.andM;Test Environment: NetWare 386 3.0 with a Compaq Systempro 80386 server, IBMPS/2 Model 70 80386 node with PC-DOS 4.0, and Epson Equity II 80286 node withMS-DOS 3.30.andP;  The IBM network node includes an EGA display and MicrosoftMouse.andP;  The Epson network node includes a monochrome display.andP;  Both nodeshave 640K bytes of memory.andP;  Menu Manager Network Version 4.1 was tested.andM;Adding menu software to your network should not just make life easier forusers, it should make life easier for the network administrator as well.andO;Amtec Menu Manager meets this requirement by taking advantage of the NetWareenvironment in which it is running and by offering a hierarchical-menuinterface for developing user menus.andP;  The menu programming language is easyto understand should you decide to edit or create menus outside of MenuManager.andP;  The programming language also includes dynamic macros that areevaluated only when the menu is accessed by a user.andP;  With macros, you cancreate a single menu file that actually performs like a customized menu foranyone who executes it.andM;From the network user's point of view, the attractive menus created throughMenu Manager will make the network essentially invisible.andP;  Menus can becreated so that directory trustee rights are evaluated for the user before anitem is displayed in his menu, so he won't be frustrated by inadvertentlytrying to get at something to which he has no access rights.andP;  Since the menusare compiled, they respond faster than menus that are interpreted atexecution.andP;  In addition, the user has an added sense of security with his ownwork since he can lock his keyboard at any time with the touch of a button.andO;Without having to log completely off the network, he can ensure that no onewanders into his office and accesses his secure data.andP;  Users will also likethe fact that mouse controls can be implemented through Menu Manager forprograms that don't include mouse support.andM;Network users with hard drives may choose to install Menu Manager on theirlocal drives to provide easy access to persons tools and applications.andP;  Afterlogging onto the network Menu Manager, they can press a single key to swap totheir local menus without jeopardizing network security.andM;One For AllandM;When you buy the Network Version, you may install it only once on only oneserver.andP;  The Amtec diskette has embedded information to keep track of howmany times you have installed it.andP;  The main inconvenience to this type ofsystem is that any backup of the original diskette will be unusable.andP;  If youdiligently make backups and store your originals before installing softwareas most companies recommend, you will soon discover that Menu Manager cannotbe installed from backups.andP;  If you take the lazy man's approach to softwareinstallation and buy the appropriate number of licenses for the number ofservers on which you will install the software, but then open only one set ofdiskettes and attempt to install each server from the same diskette, you'llagain find it doesn't work.andP;  The good news is, once you have installed thesoftware on a server, the number of users is not limited by Amtec.andP;  Inaddition, you may copy the files to any workstation with a hard drive thatconnects to the installed server.andP;  Network users may then swap to a localmenu system from the network menu system.andM;Aside from the above inconveniences, Amtec's installation routine is abreeze.andP;  All you have to do is tell it the floppy drive name and thedestination network drive and directory name.andP;  The specified directory iscreated and the appropriate files are copied there are to the SYS:LOGINdirectory.andM;Defining Users and MenusandM;The MAKEMENU command accesses a menu-driven program to define menus and, forsecurity on local hard drives, user profiles.andP;  User profiles include name,password, initial directory, and start-up menu.andP;  For the networkinstallation, user profiles are taken from the NetWare definitions that youdefine through the NetWare SYSCON utility.andP;  The start-up menu and initialdirectory must be defined in each user's login script; the MANAGERenvironment variable should also be set.andP;  In addition, each user'sAUTOEXEC.BAT file must be changed to execute the Menu Manager command LOGON,which was automatically installed in SYS:LOGIN.andM;The LOGON command offers parameters to define which server to log onto.andO;Since Menu Manager offers a function key with which users can quickly logonto other servers, a parameter can be set to disable this feature at logon.andO;Yet another LOGON option may be set to specify the amount of time a node mayremain inactive before the screen saver blanks the screen.andP;  After theAUTOEXEC.BAT file at each workstation has been changed and users' loginscripts edited, Menu Manager will be available for any network user.andM;I wanted to install the software on the local hard drive for the Epsoncomputer, so I copied the required files from the network drive and from theoriginal distribution diskette as the documentation explained.andP;  I set up theappropriate drives for users and menus, and ran the MAKEMENU command todefine the user profiles for those people allowed to use the local harddrive.andM;I ran only into one problem in the installation process, but it was easy toresolve.andP;  When I tried to log on as SUPERVISOR (or any other user name), Icontinually received an error on the network node.andP;  When I looked to theAmtec documentation to resolve the problem, I discovered the manual did notinclude an index.andM;I noticed a chapter called &quot;Error Messages&quot; in the table of contents, butcould not find the error I was receiving.andP;  Referring to my NetWasredocumentation, I discovered that I needed to run the command sET ENCRYPTEDPASSWORDS OFF on the server.andP;  I didn't see any other way around the problem,but at least this corrected the error.andM;Of course, the system isn't of much use without defining menus, so let me getback to the MAKEMENU utility.andP;  This utility can be accessed through thecommand line or through a function key after you have logged onto the serverwith Menu Manager.andP;  The hierarchical menus step you through the process ofdefining menus in an orderly fashion so that each option is defined as itwoudl appear in the menu source file.andP;  For a first-time user, this is awelcome feature--you are assured not to miss an available option, and optionsare not offered unless they are compatible with the current definition.andM;For example, when you first define a menu item, a list of functions that canbe associated with that item is offered.andP;  These functions include displayinga help message, prompting for user input, and invoking another menu, to namethree.andP;  If you choose the function to prompt for user input then the functionto invoke another menu will not be offered in the list of functions for thattiem any longer.andM;These hierarchical menus will familiarize you with the source file format sothat when you become proficient enough that the menus seem cumbersome, youcan call up your favorite ASCII text editor and create the menu source filesquickly by hand.andP;  You will just need to familizarize yourself with theprogramming terminology associated with all the information the menu hadprompted you for.andM;The manual is organized in a fashion that is handy for creating new menusthrough a text editor because the source file commands are defined in theorder in which you would find them in a menu file.andP;  The first commanddocumented is the SCREEN command that indicates the start of a menu sourcefile and the name of the first menu.andP;  While having commands organized in thedocumentation like this is useful when you are creating a new menu, it is notvery useful when you are trying to edit an existing menu.andP;  If all you want todo is figure out how to add a prompt for user input to a menu, you must firstread through the commands section to familiarize yourself with the filestructure.andM;One menu source file can actually contain several menus belonging to the samemenu tree.andP;  The menu items in any source file can access a menu within thesame source file or call a new source file.andP;  This simplifies maintenance bykeeping the number of files small.andM;When defining menu items with MENUMAKER or any text editor, you may defineitems to invoke a menu within the same source file, to call a different menusource file, to execute a program, to shell to DOS, or to terminate the MenuManager program.andP;  When a program is executed or an option shells to DOS, MenuManager may be swapped out of memory.andP;  This leaves about 7K bytes of memoryoccupied by Menu Manager, as opposed to its usual 96K bytes.andP;  This isespecially recommended for terminate-stay-resident (TSR) utilities.andM;When I invoked a TSR from a Menu Manager menu using this option, everythingcontinued to work well, and the TSR was available while menus were displayedor other processes were running.andM;I also employed this feature to execute the DOS CHKDSK command so that Icould discover how much memroy Menu Manager actually left free forapplications.andP;  CHKDSK reported all but about 7.8K bytes free.andP;  Because MenuManager reserves this amount of memory, it does not have the problem found inother menu utilities of failing to return from batch programs because theyinvoke a secondary command processor.andP;  In fact, the Menu Managerdocumentation recommends that you employ a \BATCH directory and executeapplications throgh batch files defined there.andP;  By doing this, you have onlya single file to edit when you need to change the method with which anapplication is invoked because, for example, you've upgraded the application.andO;In addition, this method requires that only a single search drive beinstalled on the server for faster execution of commands.andM;Security FeaturesandM;Several flags may be applied to menu items to ensure system security.andP;  Theseinclude the ability to prohibit DOS shells from within programs and optionsto restrict any menu item's use.andP;  Because many applications include theability to shell to DOS, thus providing users with greater access to networkdrives than you may want them to have, you may flag the menu item to prohibitDOS shells.andP;  The Menu Manager documentation warns that some applications maynot function correctly when this flag is set, but encourages you to try it ifyou want the added measure of security.andP;  I tried this option on one menu itemthat I created.andP;  The menu item successfully invoked my Zedit word processorso that I could not shell to DOS without receiving an error message.andM;In addition, a security flag may be set to restrict use of a given menu item.andO;This flag may be set so that the user has to reenter his password to accessthe option or so that he has to enter a specific password defined just forthat option.andP;  With a password attached to an item, administrators and usersdon't have to worry that an unauthorized person might find an unoccupiedcomputer where someone has previously logged onto the server with access tosecure files.andP;  By forcing a password, only the same user who originallylogged into the system or users privileged to know the password can executethe menu item.andP;  The security flag may also be set so that only members ofspecified groups or specified users have access to menu items.andP;  This methodof security could be used to ensure that only the system administrator hadthe ability to execute a menu item to terminate the Menu Manager.andM;One last measure of security is provided for the network user's own peace ofmind.andP;  Users may lock their keyboards and require that their password beentered before any other keyboard activity.andP;  Unfortunately, this cannot beinvoked when the user is in the middle of another program executed by MenuManager or when he has a DOS shell from within the menu software.andP;  Thekeyboard lock is only available when menus are displayed on the user'sscreen.andM;As Little Work As PossibleandM;With all of the features Menu Manager offers, there is one that is probablythe most beneficial to system administrators.andP;  That feature is dynamicmacros.andP;  Dynamic macros provide the ability to create a single menu sourcefile that will appear to be customized for each particular user.andP;  Among themacros that are evaluated when the menu is executed are three that return thecurrent user name.andP;  One returns the full name defined by the NetWare SYSCONutility, another returns the logon name, the third returns the first eightcharacters of the logon name.andP;  These macros can be entered, for example, tospecify the user's name in a menu title or to specify a customized batch fileto be executed when a menu item is selected.andP;  Dynamic macros can also returnvalues specified in environment variables, different forms of the currentdate, current drive, current directory, file server name, and logical orphysical workstation numbers.andP;  Macros allow you to retrieve information onthe fly to determine the workstation on which Menu Manager is being executedand what user is executing it.andP;  With the environment variables, you can evendefine NetWare groups to which a user belongs so that specific menus can beshared by every member of a group.andM;I defined a login script for users belonging to a group called CAD thatdefined the environment variable GROUP to be CAD.andP;  When the menu item&quot;Programs&quot; is selected from the generic main menu, it evaluates the dynamicmacro @ENV@GROUP to determine the next menu.andP;  For those users in the CADgroup, the next menu is &quot;CAD Utilities&quot;.andP;  Within this second menu, the optionCAD executes the computer-aided-design package that everyone is required touse.andP;  Since everyone in the group is not required to use the same texteditor, an Editor option evaluates the user name to determine what program toinvoke.andP;  When anyone selects the Editor option, the menu evaluates theeight-character logon name macro to change to the user's home directory andexecute the EDITOR.BAT.andP;  This batch file invokes each user's favorite editorand is maintained by the user.andP;  Because the initial directory was changed tothe user's home directory, this ensures that each user creates files bydefault in his own working directory.andM;Another time-saving feature is the ability to create menu items that are notdisplayed if a user does not have the appropriate trustee rights andsecurity.andP;  This means that you don't have to prepare menus for group managersseparate from the menus that other group members will use.andP;  You can defineitems to which only the group managers have access in the general menus youcreate for each group, and these items will not appear on the screen foranyone other than the group managers.andM;More StuffandM;System administrators will have fun editing the colors and attributes ofitems on the screen of any Menu Manager product.andP;  They will also probablyfind the online manual handy since it helps troubleshoot problems at anynetwork node without having to tote the manual around with them.andM;And the fun doesn't stop there.andP;  Menu Manager offers system administratorsthe ability to verify user input, to create customized help screens for themenus they create, and to send a message of the day to a specific user or toall users.andP;  User input verification can force users to enter a nonexistentfilename or directory or to specify an existing file or directory.andO;Customized help screens can be implemented to explain just what is requiredof the user at any point in the menu structure.andP;  With the message of the day,you can remind people to clean up their files if they are hogging too much ofthe hard disk space, or you can notify everyone of upcoming maintenance thatwill require the file server to be down.andP;  These features make systemmaintenance less of a headache.andM;Menu Manager also offers the ability to meter software so that only thenumber of users licensed or otherwise allowed to use an application canaccess it at the same time.andP;  This is also useful for ensuring that a userdoes not attempt to execute communications software to access a server'smodem if someone else is already running that software.andM;Some of the nice features that will also appeal to network users include theability to swap to a separate menu system on a local hard drive and theability to project mouse buttons and mouse movement.andP;  The mouse projectionoption can be assigned to any menu item when the menu is created, so a mousecan be used to some extent even with programs that weren't written to supportmouse input.andP;  When I invoked a calendar utility that did not support a mouse,I was able to move the mouse to reposition the cursor within the calendarscreen rather than using the cursor keys.andP;  By projecting the mouse buttons, Iwas able to press the leftmost button rather than the andless;Enterandgt; key on thekeyboard, the rightmost button for the escape key, and both for the firstfunction key.andM;One area of the application available to both users and system administratorsthat did not particularly appeal to me was function keys.andP;  Since these aren'twell documented, I certainly did not find them as easy to implement as otheroptions of the Menu Manager software.andP;  In fact, I found most of the functionkeys annoying.andP;  One function key offers access to the MENUMAKER utility onthe network.andP;  While users certainly need access to this utility to maintaintheir own menus on local hard drives, they do not need, and in most casesshould not have, access to it on the network drive.andP;  If the function keyswere better documented, this may not have been a problem.andM;Big Things in SmallandM;PackagesandM;I was surprised by the range of features offered by this menu utility,considering that it came on a single floppy disk and didn't promise a slew ofadd-on functions.andP;  I was pleased that the package offered the ability toproject mouse buttons and movement into programs that didn't support a mouseand that users could maintain a personalized menu system on their local harddrives separate from the network menus.andP;  However, what is most impressiveabout the Menu Manager software is the extent to which it is able to useinformation already defined for NetWare (such as the user names andpasswords), especially its ability to evaluate this information on the fly sothat macros can be used to create generic menus that actually performspecifically for an individual's or group's requirements.andP;  According to thepresident of Amtec, Simon Downey, my complaint about the function keys willbe fixed later this year in release 4.3 (they decided not to release 4.2)when Amtec adds programmable function keys, and all upgrades are free.andP;  Amtecalso plans to release a NetBIOS version later this year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
