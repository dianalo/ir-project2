Human platelet membranestreated under alkaline conditions (pH 11.5) exhibited a selective andcomplete loss of high affinity agonist binding as measured by the paritalagonist [{sup 3}H]-p-aminoclonidine and full agonist [{sup 3}H]UK 14,304in direct binding studies. The binding parameters for [{sup 3}H]UK 14,304are as follows: for control platelet membranes, the K/sub d/ was 0.88+/- 0.17 and nM and the B/sub max/ was 280 +/- 20 fmol/mg compared to1.89 +/- 0.34 nM and 75 fmol/mg for pH 11.5 treated membranes. For [{sup3}H]p-aminoclonidine, the data for pH 11.5 treated membranes is as follows:B/sub max/ = 100 +/- 20 fmol/mg, K/sub d/ = 3.4 +/- 0.1 nM, comparedto control membranes: (best fit with a two site fit) K/sub d1/ = 0.7nM, K/sub d2/ = 8 nM, B/sub max1/ = 76 fmol/mg, B/sub max2/ = 198 fmol/mg.The {alpha}{sub 2} antagonists, [{sup 3}H]yohimbine, was used to assessthe presence of the receptor.</TEXT></DOC>
