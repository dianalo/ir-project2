But Pentagon suppliers are worried that the adjustmentwill be short-lived, as a result of a new system being usedto calculate the rate of the payments. The new plan containssome &quot;very, very significant negatives,&quot; Lockheed Corp.Chairman Daniel Tellep said in a recent interview.</LP><TEXT>   The brouhaha over &quot;progress payments&quot; -- the Pentagon'scustomary method of contract financing, whereby a certainpercentage of a contractor's expenses are paid for prior tocompletion of the pact -- cuts to the heart of the industry'sconcerns about its financial condition.   Last year alone, military contractors wrote off more than$2 billion from losses on fixed-price agreements andcorporate restructurings. Meanwhile, changes in the law haveforced companies to stop deferring their tax payments untilcompletion of a contract, further draining their cash. All ofthis has happened, of course, while the defense budget hasbegun to shrink.   The procurement process has, in many ways, become &quot;akilling field to the viability of our industry,&quot; BernardSchwartz, the chairman of electronic-equipment maker LoralCorp., warned a Senate Armed Services subcommittee a fewmonths ago.   Specifically, he said, the average internal rate of returnfor the industry is 6.6%, while the average cost of capitalis between 10% and 12%. &quot;In a purely financial sense,&quot; hesaid, &quot;those companies which invested billions of dollars inthis country's next-generation defense capability would havebeen better off to put their money in long-term governmentsecurities.&quot;   The change taking effect today will raise the level ofprogress payments to 85% from 80%, where it has stood sinceOctober 1988. On its face, it is a step that will reduce theneed for borrowings and, therefore, is being welcomed warmlyby the contracting community.   &quot;Even a difference of 5% is significant,&quot; said LeRoyHaugh, vice president of procurement and finance at theAerospace Industries Association, a Washington-based tradegroup. &quot;We see no reason in principle why it shouldn't gohigher,&quot; he added.   But many are worried that the level could actually golower again. That is because the Pentagon has adopted a new,complex formula by which progress payments are tied toshort-term borrowing rates. &quot;The way we see the rates going,we'll be right back to 80% by next April,&quot; said Dave Koonce,director of financial analysis for Martin Marietta Corp., whois monitoring the issue for the industries association.   A Defense Department spokesman said the Pentagon officialsresponsible for the new policy declined comment.   Mr. Koonce vowed that the industry would keep pressingahead with its case to set the level of payments at 85% orhigher, without any caveats. &quot;If they're really concernedabout the health of the industry, he said, &quot;you have towonder why they've attached these strings.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
