The total installed power of 300 GWecorresponds to 11% of the total generating capacity and contributes morethan 16% of the worldwide electricity production. Fifty of these nuclearpower plants, with an aggregate 28 GWe, have been built in developingcountries, where they contribute 7% to the electricity requirement. Withrespect to installed power, the growth of nuclear power lags behind theplans made ten years ago, because some developing countries have stretchedout their nuclear power programs for the next decade. This is due tovarious reasons. In some cases, the availability of alternative energieshas reduced the use of nuclear power. In other cases, the delay has beendue to funding and to the long planning and construction periods. Themain problem facing the developing countries, however, is financing nuclearpower plant projects in the light of the high capital costs of nuclearpower plants.</TEXT></DOC>
