In an unusual decision, the agency said it would file a friend-of-the-court brief with the Texas Supreme Court, urging it to accept Texaco's requested appeal of the mammoth verdict on an issue involving tender offer regulations. The agency said it would file the brief the week of July 20.    &quot;It's very favorable news for Texaco,&quot; said George Leisure, a partner in the New York law firm of Donovan Leisure Newton andamp; Irvine. &quot;It's quite a feather in their cap to have that kind of help.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texaco closed at $39.375 a share, up $1.50, on volume of 1.5 million shares, making it the sixth-most active issue. Also in Big Board trading, Pennzoil shares fell $4, to close at $78.875.    At issue is a technicality -- but one that goes to the heart of the case. Houston-based Pennzoil won its court judgment in 1985 after convincing a Houston jury that it had a binding contract to buy a 42% interest in Getty Oil Co., and that White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco had unlawfully interfered with that agreement by later purchasing all of Getty Oil for itself. But from the beginning of the case, Texaco has claimed that if Pennzoil did have a contract, the agreement violated a federal tender offer regulation, and was therefore null and void.    The regulation -- SEC Rule 10b-13 -- prevents anyone from arranging the private purchase of a company's shares while the buyer has a tender offer outstanding. Part of the Pennzoil merger transaction with Getty Oil involved an agreement to purchase the 12% of the company held by the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu, Calif. That agreement was entered into while Pennzoil still had a tender offer outstanding for Getty Oil's shares. Getty Oil lawyers have complained that Pennzoil used the tender offer as an unfair form of leverage -- as a &quot;gun to the head&quot; -- during merger negotiations with Getty Oil.    The SEC's decision &quot;clearly establishes a much broader avenue for relief for Texaco, both in the Texas Supreme Court and ultimately in the U.S. Supreme Court,&quot; said Steven Feirson of the Philadelphia law firm of Dechert Price andamp; Rhoads, which represented Getty Oil. Despite the seemingly hyper-technical nature of the issue, he added, the SEC's willingness to take a position makes that matter &quot;more than simply a litigant's posturing.&quot;    &quot;There's no question this gives the issue the prominence it deserves,&quot; added Michael Schwartz of the New York law firm of Wachtell Lipton Rosen andamp; Katz, which represents the Getty Museum. &quot;As to how it will affect the outcome of the appeal,&quot; he said, &quot;no one can determine.&quot;    Texaco, which has been operating under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy-law protection from creditors' lawsuits since April, was restrained in its reaction to the SEC decision, saying only that it was &quot;pleased and encouraged.&quot; Pennzoil, for its part, expressed confidence that the lower-court decisions upholding its verdict would withstand Texaco's appeals. And Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University constitutional law professor representing Texaco in the case, said it was impossible to say how strongly the SEC's brief would aid Texaco's case -- if it helps at all. Texaco, Mr. Tribe asserted, has no standing to assert the Rule 10b-13 argument because it wasn't a shareholder of Getty Oil.    The commission, in a letter to the companies, said only that it would file a brief urging the Texas court to hear Texaco's appeal on the 10b-13 issue. But when asked whether the SEC's brief would take the same position as Texaco has on the matter, Charles Cox, acting SEC chairman, replied, &quot;I'd say you are on the right track.&quot;    Pressed again, he confirmed, &quot;You have basically got the right view of (the commission's position).&quot; But he emphasized that the SEC will limit its brief to the narrow issue of how Rule 10b-13 should be applied in the Texaco-Pennzoil battle over Getty Oil.    &quot;It involves the interpretation of the specific rule,&quot; Mr. Cox said. &quot;It isn't as though it addresses the whole scope of what's going on in the Texaco-Pennzoil matter. It's a point of securities law that we felt is worthwhile to stress.&quot;    A source close to the SEC said the brief will contend there was a violation of Rule 10b-13. The five-member commission decided, apparently by a unanimous vote, to submit an amicus brief before Chairman John Shad left to become ambassador to the Netherlands. &quot;I don't recall that there was any difference of opinion,&quot; Mr. Cox said.    The SEC never enters state trial-court proceedings and only rarely steps into state supreme courts, agency attorneys said. The last occasion was in March 1985, when the SEC filed a brief in Delaware Supreme Court, opposing Household International Inc.'s so-called poison-pill defense against hostile takeover bids. Customarily, the agency takes stands on regulatory issues in federal court cases.    &quot;Generally, we deal at the appellate level, and the higher the appellate level, the more likely we will appear,&quot; said Daniel Goelzer, the SEC's general counsel, in explaining why the commission didn't act sooner in the long-running Texaco-Pennzoil case. Commissioner Edward Fleischman added that the &quot;issue had to get refined&quot; by a lower-level Texas appeals court before the commission could get involved.    The Texas appeals court rejected Texaco's argument that Rule 10b-13 rendered any Pennzoil-Getty contract unenforceable. Among other things, the court found, Pennzoil could have obtained an exemption from the rule. In court filings, however, Texaco claims that the SEC has only twice granted exemptions to Rule 10b-13 and in cases with circumstances that differed vastly from Pennzoil's agreement with Getty Oil.    In its court briefs, Pennzoil has dismissed Texaco's 10b-13 argument as &quot;elaborate and strained,&quot; claiming that under a hyper-technical application of the law, Texaco's own agreements in its acquisition of Getty Oil violated the same rule. Pennzoil also has claimed that Texaco raised the issue insufficiently during the trial to create an appellate case from it.    Even if the SEC brief doesn't squarely support Texaco, it is bound to give the company some public relations value. Calvert Crary, a litigation analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New York, pointed out that the state attorneys general of New York and Delaware have previously filed briefs claiming that the judgment ignored certain principles of New York and Delaware law that were applied in the Texas case. &quot;These courts can't apply anyone else's law other than their own,&quot; Mr. Crary asserted, &quot;and they can't apply that very well.&quot;    Pennzoil has accused Texaco of soliciting briefs from outside parties as part of a public-relations campaign. </TEXT></DOC>
