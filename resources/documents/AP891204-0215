(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   During the Great Depression, Eudora Weltycaptured the many guises of poverty through her camera's lens.   And despite the despair, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author founda natural joy as Mississipians washed laundry by hand, tended abootleg still or slaughtered hogs.   Unlike other photographers who chronicled the era, such asWalker Evans and Dorothea Lange who intentionally illustrated thepain and bitterness of the period, Welty's photographs aren't amisery index of any sort. The Southern writer found almostuniversally pleasant emotions in her unposed subjects.   Her 1930s photographs _ taken as she traveled Mississippi as apublicity agent for President Roosevelt's Works ProgressAdministration _ provide solid evidence of the joy and pride shesaw among even the most poverty-stricken residents of the nation'spoorest state.   Welty, 80, says her favorite face is that of a middle-age womanstanding with hands at her side in a tattered sweater. The portraitis the first to appear in both of Welty's photography books.   ``It shows such a marvelous character,'' she said. ``These weretaken in the Depression when everybody had absolutely nothing. Andshe looked so valiant and courageous, dignified and completelyself-possessed while she was so poor _ and in an old sweater fullof holes.''   ``One Time, One Place,'' a book of 100 black-and-whitephotographs published in 1971 by Random House, focused exclusivelyon Welty's Depression era pictures.   Her new book, ``Eudora Welty Photographs,'' recently publishedby the University Press of Mississippi, features 226black-and-white images _ many included in the first book. Theyextend into the '50s and across the globe. However, the '30sphotographs of poor Mississippians still dominate in both quantityand quality.   Other photographs include architecture of the South and otherAmerican and foreign regions Welty has visited and portraits ofsuch writers, painters, musicians and sculptors as Katherine AnnePorter, V.S. Pritchett, Elizabeth Bowen, Eddy Sackville-West,Lehman Engel, Hubert Creekmore and Jose de Creeft.   Welty, author of ``The Ponder Heart,'' ``Losing Battles'' and``The Optimist's Daughter,'' for which she won the Pulitzer in1972, said it was fiction that provided her with the mostproductive tool for dissecting every dimension of a humanpersonality.   But in her Depression-era photography, she hopes viewersconcentrate on the faces of her subjects and not just theoverwhelming poverty. ``I think they need to see the face in themidst of the poverty _ see the situation in reality and yet see thecharacter, the human being,'' she said.   ``Eudora Welty Photographs'' sells for $49.95. It includes asix-page foreward by novelist Reynolds Price and a 16-pagequestion-and-answer interview with Welty on when, why and how shetook the photographs. The interview was conducted by Hunter Coleand Seetha Srinivasan of the University Press of Mississippi.   Welty insists she isn't a photographer and a review of thetechnical quality of her work will miss her point altogether. Shecalls her pictures ``snapshots,'' a kind of community ``familyalbum.'' She used a simple Eastman Kodak with bellows at first, andlater a more sophisticated Rolleiflex.   She tutored herself in the art of photography and never thoughtof publishing the ``snapshots'' at the time. She notes, forexample, that many photographs inside buildings are underexposedbecause of her ignorance about light. Her picture-taking diminishedafter she lost the Rolleiflex on the Paris sabway in 1951.   ``They keep fussing at me at the University Press when I say I'man amateur, but I am,'' she said. ``I was interested in mysubjects, not my expertise.''   There are considerably more black people in the book than hadbeen shown in other collections and more than one would expect fromwhite photographers traveling the South. Welty says that issomething that couldn't be duplicated today, because in the 1930sthere was ``more trust'' between blacks and whites _ and the trust``dates'' the photographs more than anything else.   It was easy then for a moderately affluent white person to talkwith an impoverished black stranger and ask to take his picture.Today, suspicion and overtones of exploitation would prevent suchencounters, she said.   ``I didn't ever approach anybody and say `Stand still, I want totake your picture.' It was all done on a human basis, with commoncourtesy,'' Welty said. ``What I would usually say was `Do you mindif I take your picture doing just what you're doing now.' ... Ididn't pose anyone. I didn't say stand here and do this. That's whyI think the pictures are so good. They are just doing what they'redoing.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Dec. 15-17</NOTE></DOC>
