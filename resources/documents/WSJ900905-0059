The funding was pumped into Brookfield Development Corp.,BCE Development's chief operating subsidiary, to allow workto continue on construction projects. However, some of themoney has been used by BCE Development to meet debenturepayments and other debt obligations. By the end of the firstquarter, C$358 million of the credit had been used up.   &quot;They {BCE and Carena} have the right to say `We don'twant you using {the money} for other things like debenturepayments,'&quot; said BCE Development's president and chiefexecutive officer, Gordon Arnell.   The company said Brookfield is its only source of fundsfor meeting its debt obligations. Mr. Arnell said thecompany's next debenture payment comes up in October and theboard will meet then to decide what to do.   The company said that if Brookfield's support iswithdrawn, &quot;the company will present to debenture and othercorporate debt holders a plan to restructure theirobligations.&quot; Mr. Arnell said he doesn't think the company isfacing bankruptcy. He said the company would hope to developa debt restructuring plan that its creditors would agree tovoluntarily.   The company also said in the statement that, given &quot;thefurther deterioration in the real-estate markets since thebeginning of the year, a further asset provision may berequired.&quot; BCE Development took a C$550 million write-down onits real-estate assets in the fourth quarter of 1989.   &quot;It's not to say these things are going to happen,&quot; Mr.Arnell said of the company's gloomy statement. &quot;We want toput people on notice that these things are possible.&quot;   The company said it expects its previously reported rightsoffering of Brookfield shares to go ahead as planned. Underthe proposal, Carena and BCE would convert up to the fullC$500 million of their credit facility into equity. The twocompanies are also considering a proposal to convertcapitalized interest that has accrued under the creditfacility, the company said. This would result in about C$600million of equity being subscribed for by Carena and BCEunder the offering.   BCE Development also reported yesterday a first-quarterloss of C$38.1 million, or 26 Canadian cents a share. It saidthat, until it completes the rights offering, it willcontinue to operate at a loss.   On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, BCE Developmentclosed unchanged at 24 Canadian cents.</TEXT></DOC>
