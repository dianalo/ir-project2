 vendorsto develop and introduce networking products adhering to international OSIstandards.andM;However, GOSIP 1 has not forced the spate of products necessary to build anoperational interworking environment with heterogeneous systems and networks.andO;Full-functioning internetworking will have to wait for GOSIP 2, 3, andbeyond.andP;  Products compliant with the limited GOSIP 1 will allow minimalinternetworking--simple file transfer and X.400 messaging--but even theseproducts have no formal interoperability testing proof.andP;  Ad hoc solutionsmust make up the deficits in GOSIP specifications.andM;The most significant trend in automating organizations today is distributedprocessing, or placing computer-processing power in locations closer to itsuse--desks, workgroups, and departments--as opposed to using a large centralmainframe.andP;  Computers' remarkable increase in power and reduction in costhave propelled the rise of distributed computing and its enabler, computernetworks.andP;  Computer network products are required to connect the many typesof computer environments for information access and sharing.andP;  Thisrequirement applies not only to government but commercial and educationsectors.andP;  Organization-wide networks are growing because of the productivitygained by access to information on computers spread across sites.andM;Corporations realize the challenge posed by competitors using networks tocreate competitive advantages.andP;  For these corporations, survival is at stakein the ever-quickening and more demanding markets of the 1990s.andP;  The U.S.andO;government is driven by debt-reduction measures to be more productive withlarge investments in existing computer systems from many vendors.andO;Departments and agencies are forced to increase services with the samespending constraints.andM;The internetworking demand will continue to increase dramatically as one ofthe computer industry's fastest-growing segments.andP;  The major nonproprietarychoices are the TCP/IP and OSI protocols.andP;  No single internetworking standardwill ever prevail--IBM's SNA and other proprietary solutions will alwaysexist.andP;  However, OSI will eventually become the dominant nonproprietarysolution by 2000.andM;History Begins with OSIandM;The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) became involved in1979 in setting U.S.andP;  government-wide networking standards based on the OSI'sstandards.andP;  By choosing international standards, NIST hopes to encouragevendors to produce products that satisfy government needs while meeting therequirements of a world market.andM;The first ISO standards were completed in 1984 for the session and transportlayers.andP;  Even before these first standards were completed, quick developmentof interoperable products was clearly impossible because the standardsincluded incompatible options, classes, and subsets and failed to make hardimplementation choices.andP;  The breadth of the early OSI standards and the manystandards that followed precluded any hope for interoperable products fromdifferent vendor implementations.andM;NIST tackled the problem of finding an interoperable, practical subset of OSIstandards that could be implemented within reasonable time and resourcecosts.andP;  The OSI Implementors' Workshops were established by NIST (then calledthe National Bureau of Standards), bringing together interested vendors.andM;The OSI Implementor Agreements are the basis for GOSIP FIPS.andP;  GOSIP, authoredby a group of government representatives from 19 federal agencies, is thestrongest driving force for OSI products in the U.S.andP;  because of the lack ofmarket demand for OSI in the private sector, where the major resistance stemsfrom their scarcity, their failure to be proven interoperable, and TCP/IPcompetition.andM;TCP/IP products have matured for more than 10 years in to a widely acceptedinterworking solution.andP;  Their features and problems are well known.andP;  TCP/IPproducts connect most computing environments providing basic file transfer,electronic mail, terminal emulation, and network management.andP;  If networkbuyers need a mixed-vendor internetworking solution, TCP/IP products arereadily available.andM;Proven OSI products, on the other hand, are not abundant, with the exceptionof the widely available X.25 products, which are necessary but not sufficientfor interworking.andP;  OSI's Message-Handling Services (MHS) X.400 products;Manufacturing Automation Protocol products; File Transfer, Access, andManagement (FTAM); and Virtual Terminal products are available in variousforms from several vendors.andM;The lack of OSI products and the increasing popularity of TCP/IP products hasled to a demand to extend TCP/IP products' functionality rather than wait forthe richer OSI products, as is evident in Simple Network Management Protocol(SNMP).andP;  SNMP has taken a strong lead over OSI network-managementprotocols--a lead that will only be slowly relinquished over the next severalyears.andM;The features and functions of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol may also beextended, because X.400 is too complex, bulky to implement and use, andprobably more expensive to operate.andP;  Furthermore, TCP/IP protocols andapplications may soon come under control of U.S.andP;  standards bodies such asANSI.andP;  These actions will extend TCP/IP's life to the point that OSI maynever completely replace it, but will be another enduring thorn of complexityin the side of users who desire simplicity through standards.andM;GOSIP in ActionandM;Many large government agencies have developed and are implementing OSImigration plans; major network purchases should occur in late 1990 and 1991.andO;Many government-sector network suppliers and defense contractors have startedusing OSI products; systems integrators and aerospace firms are leading theway.andM;GOSIP will let vendors release products available to the general market.andO;Most network vendors announced GOSIP-compliant products available in the U.S.andO;in August 1990.andP;  GOSIP is helping to create a competitive arena where networkbuyers will have choices of products to fill their needs.andM;In Infonetics Research Institute's study, &quot;OSI: User Requirements and BuyingPlans,&quot; potential OSI network buyers indicated that their strongest concernwas interoperability of different vendors' products--or, rather, the lackthereof.andP;  Interoperability of multivendor computing systems is the promise ofand the genesis for the GOSIP and OSI standards efforts.andP;  Network buyers wantproof that products from various vendors will work together as promised.andP;  Onevendor's products' adherence or conformance to the standard is no guaranteethat the conforming software will interoperate with another vendor'sstandards-compliant product.andM;NIST spearheads U.S.andP;  interoperability efforts, primarily through OSI-net'stesting and registration of announced products.andP;  OSInet is an organization ofU.S.andP;  users and suppliers trying to solve the interoperability testingproblem.andM;The purpose is to perform one-time vendor-to-vendor testing of OSI products.andO;Records of successful test results will be registered in a database availableto network buyers, especially the U.S.andP;  government.andP;  Such testing wouldideally occur as part of the normal product-development cycle.andM;Although all 20 vendor members of OSInet will probably become part of theregistration service, the initial vendors involved are IBM, Unisys, Digital,NCR, Xerox, RETIX, Touch, The Wollongong Group, Hewlett-Packard, and ControlData.andP;  The vendors hope the service will reduce product costs, shortendelivery schedules, instill confidence in multivendor internetworking, and,finally, sell more products.andM;The OSInet testing and registration process begins when testing parties(typically two vendors) privately, voluntarily, and bilaterally agree toperform certain interoperation tests.andP;  NIST develops the interoperabilitytest suites, which consist of applications programs.andP;  Out of the 80 testsavailable for X.400, 23 will be used for GOSIP MHS.andP;  The GOSIP 1 FTAM suitehas about 30 tests.andM;Leading the ChargeandM;While FTAM provides data accessibility across mixed-vendor environments, twoother protocols are leading the OSI charge: X.400 and X.25.andP;  The X.400messaging standard is becoming the transport or gateway between mostproprietary electronic-mail systems used within and between corporations.andO;Most U.S.andP;  and European electronic-messaging services are based on or providegateways to X.400.andM;One important business justification for buying X.400 products or services isElectronic Data Interchange (EDI).andP;  Many organizations now electronicallycommunicate business documents, such as purchase and sales orders, proposals,and contracts, saving time and labor while providing and receiving betterservice in the process.andM;X.25 continues to grow as one of the standard wide-area transport methods fordigital networks.andP;  The most widely used OSI protocol, X.25 forms the basisfor private packet-switching products as well as many public value-addednetworks such as Tymnet and Telenet.andP;  X.25 is an OSI protocol with its ownmarket independent of other OSI protocols.andP;  As with many protocols, X.25began outside of OSI, and today's buyers are not particularly concerned thatX.25 is an OSI product.andM;Vendor IssuesandM;Vendors are faced with the dilemma of where to spend their resources, themost valuable of which is product development staffs.andP;  For larger vendors(and many smaller ones as well), hard choices must be made between TCP/IP andOSI product development.andP;  If a vendor chooses to develop only TCP/IP productstoday, can the vendor survive without supporting important government andEuropean OSI markets?andP;  Will customers judge such a vendor as notforward-looking and not buy its TCP/IP products?andM;This choice has not been made by any major player.andP;  All larger vendors thatoffer TCP/IP products have strategies--though not always products--formigration to OSI.andP;  The largest of these vendors include IBM, DEC, Unisys, HP,ATandamp;T, Sun, and NCR.andM;The problem is knowing when to redeploy TCP/IP development resources to OSIefforts.andP;  Only the largest companies, if any, can afford to support bothefforts fully.andP;  this problem has opened the door for smaller companies suchas Retix (Santa Monica, Calif.) and Touch (Campbell, Calif.) to develop OSIapplications and protocols that can be ported to other vendor environments,saving large amounts of development effort.andP;  Some vendors have specialized inTCP/IP, such as The Wollongong Group (Palo Alto, Calif.), which offers aTCP/IP-to-OSI migration path with its software products.andM;Most large computer companies have customers with an installed based of theirproprietary protocols to support--and strategies are in place for migratingthese to OSI over time.andP;  The biggest winner in the OSI products race willprobably be DEC.andP;  DEC's customers will gradually replace DECnet Phase IV withDECnet-OSI (also known as DECnet Phase V) over the next few years.andP;  DEC's OSIrevenues may not match IBM's in the long run, but DEC has the possibility ofbecoming the industry leader in OSI networking.andP;  DEC will deliver OSItransport-and network-layer products in DECnet-OSI this year.andP;  DEC haddeveloped its MAIL-bus product to be X.400-compliant.andM;Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, Calif.), an OSI pioneer, has been on a course toeventually provide OSI and IBM SNA products since 1982.andP;  HP will continue tosupport its proprietary network for existing customers and also offersTCP/IP.andM;Unisys has also developed OSI network products to combine its own independentprorietary systems, which originally came from Burroughs and Sperry.andM;NCR recently announced its complete networking strategy with OSI as a keyingredient in its Open Cooperative Computing Architecture.andP;  NCR has alsoannounced NCR Tower OSI networking for Unix environments.andP;  Several other LANvendors have announced GOSIP products, including IBM, DCA, Banyan, 3Com, andNovell.andM;GOSIP BuyersandM;Some network buyers in the government, or closely allied with them, aretrying to buy GOSIP-compliant solutions.andP;  Aerospace firms that perform a lotof government work, such as Boeing, and large systems integrators, such asEDS, are trying to put together GOSIP-comliant network environments.andP;  Thesecompanies would probably not be on the GOSIP bandwagon if they did not dependon the government for so much of their business.andM;If purchasers are careful, and especially if they don't need to mix vendors'equipment, certain environments can be GOSIP-compliant today or within sixmonths, depending when products ship.andP;  Probability of a GOSIP-compliant,mixed-vendor environment operation by the end of 1990 is slight; it dependson which vendors are involved and how much effort is needed to achieveinteroperability in that environment.andP;  It also depends on whether the fullseven layers if GOSIP protocols and applications are involved in theparticular environment.andM;A government facility that must be completely GOSIP-compliant has far feweroptions, and those choices will be much more expensive than the alternatives.andO;GOSIP will make a difference with nongovernment buyers because more OSIproducts will be available from more vendors.andP;  As far as their own networksolutions go, public-sector customers will not adopt GOSIP just for the sakeof adopting a particular standards profile.andP;  They will purchase products thatsolve their own particular problems cost effectively, and their choice isunlikely to be a purely GOSIP-compliant solution.andP;  They have greater choicein standards-based products.andM;The big winner for GOSIP contracts will be the large-systems integrators.andO;This group includes not only companies like EDS (Plano, Texas) and CSC (SanDiego, Calif.), but also most of the large vendors such as IBM, DEC, Unisys,and NCR.andP;  In many cases, small companies with OSI specialties will be calledon to supply parts of the GOSIP compliance, including Touch, Retix, and TheWollongong Group.andP;  Internetworking companies such as cisco (Menlo Park,Calif.), Vitalink (Fremont, Calif.), Wellfleet (Bedford, Mass.), Proteon(Westboro, Mass.), and others will supply routers needed in the migrationprocess to handle OSI and other protocols simultaneously.andM;The Promise of OSIandM;GOSIP requirements in the U.S.andP;  and Europe are the major external forces thathave caused early development of OSI products.andP;  Without GOSIP, many vendorswould not be spending as much development resources on OSI products today.andO;However, the demand for products that provide cost savings or competitiveadvantage will drive the OSI market.andP;  Although GOSIP has spurred OSI productdevelopment, much work is needed.andP;  The promise of OSI will be realized inthis decade with the advent of choices of mature products in the marketplace(1991-92), a critical mass of installed OSI products in corporations thatwill provide their promised productivity and savings (1993-95), enoughcorporations adopting OSI technology to benefit by communicating with theirvendors and customers through EDI (1991-96), and second - andthird-generation OSI products providing performance and distriburedapplications (1993-96).andM;Michael Howard is president of infonetics Research Institute (San Jose,Calif.), a research and consulting firm specializing in networks andtechnology.andM;Michael Dortch, author of Sybex's &quot;The ABCs of Local Area Networks,&quot; writesand consults about information networks.andP;  He is based in San Francisco.andM;Exploring OSI inandM;a TCP/IP ContextandM;Everyone involved in computing networks encounters more than a fair share ofconfusing acronyms and collections of initials.andP;  Now, software known by anewly popular set of letters helps combine the power of TCP/IP and OSI.andO;ISODE is the ISO Development Environment, a suite of programs that brings anumber of benefits to applications developers, users, and managers.andP;  ISODE isa combination of OSI-Compliant development tools and actual applications, allof which cn be used over existing network implementations which are based onTCP/IP.andM;With almost five years of globespanning development effort and an aggressivepromulgation strategy behind it, ISODE appears to offer advantages to allthose exploring OSI within a TCP/IP-based context.andP;  At the very least, ISODEseems unlikely to become just another mildly interesting set of capitalletters.andM;ISODE is an &quot;openly available&quot; implementation of the OSI model's upperlayers, says Marshall Rose, a key ISODE developer.andP;  Originally, ISODE'sdevelopers simply wanted a stable environment for applications development.andO;Because the lower layers of the OSI model were not welldefined or widelyavailable, the ISODE team decided to implement the upper layers of the OSImodel on a more stable foundation--TCP/IP.andM;Today, ISODE also includes prototype implementations of OSI-compliantdirectory services based on the X.500 standard, File Transfer, Access, andManagement (FTAM) services, and virtual terminal support.andP;  Developers can useISODE to design and build new OSI-compliant applications, while users andmanagers can use ISODE's included applications &quot;out of the box,&quot; says Rose.andM;ISODE in DetailandM;Written entirely in C with no modifications to the software kernel, ISODE canbe run on virtually every available Unix environment.andP;  ISODE has been portedto other environments, including DOS and Digital Equipment's VMS by others,but these versions are not as widely tested or available as ISODE for Unix.andM;ISODE will be included in the next release of Berkeley Unix, according toRose.andP;  This packaging will help give Berkeley Unix a full seven-layerimplementation of OSI while it may help promulgate ISODE as it popularizedTCP/IP years ago.andP;  With ISODE, builders of Unix networks can run &quot;pure&quot;TCP/IP, run OSI-compliant applications over TCP/IP, or establish linksbetween TCP/IP-based as well as OSI-based networks.andM;Running OSI applications over TCP/IP is not unique, Rose points out.andP;  Thedocument that specifies the techniques, Request for Comment 1006, has existedfor some time, and Unix vendor Retix (Santa Monica, Calif.) has offeredproducts based on this document for at least a year.andM;ISODE's included, ready-to-run applications and its developers' cooperationwith other developers and vendors make it unique.andP;  ISODE represents a&quot;reference standard&quot;--a consolidation of the conformance testing andinteroperability experiences of previous parties into a single, coherentimplementation of OSI-compliant applications over TCP/IP.andM;Multiple ContributorsandM;and BeneficiariesandM;Developers are not the only parties interested in ISODE's features andbenefits.andP;  Some vendors have already integrated ISODE into their products.andO;Most recently, Cray Research (Minneapolis, Minn.) announced OSI-compliantproducts based on ISODE for its XMP supercomputer.andM;Users and managers are interested in using ISODE for pilot implementations ofOSI applications.andP;  An ambitious example is the &quot;white pages&quot; (networkdirectory) pilot project being run by NYSERnet, a nonprofit consortium ofeducational and research institutions.andP;  Performance Systems, a company basedin Reston, Va., is under contract to NYSERnet to provide network services.andM;Rose and colleague Dwight Kass began developing ISODE in January 1986 asresearch project at Northrop's Research and Technologies Center (PalosVerdes, Calif.)andP;  The latest version of ISODE includes contributions from morethan 20 participants from Europe, the Pacific Rim, and the U.S., Rose says.andM;&quot;To meet one of our deadlines, we had one period of about 10 days wheredevelopment went on 24 hours a day,&quot; Rose recalls.andP;  &quot;I'd work on the code forapproximately eight hours, then send it to Australia, where the localdevelopers would work for eight hours before sending the code on to the U.K.andO;After eight hours' more work there, the code came back to me, and the cyclerepeated itself until we met our deadline.&quot;andM;Widely Open AvailabilityandM;Purchasers pay a one-time fee that covers materials and duplication costs,and they pay no licensing fees to use ISODE.andP;  In exchange, they agree not tohold ISODE's developers responsible should problems arise with the software.andO;This &quot;open availability,&quot; which differs from public-domain softwareagreements, lower costs, frees users from restrictions, and encouragescontributions to the software, according to ISODE's developers.andM;Five international distribution sites will send ISODE on computer tape andprinted documentation to anyone who sends in a check.andP;  It is also availableover international X.25-based packet-switched networks via FTAM or over theInternet via FTP.andP;  The U.S.andP;  distribution site is the Univ.andP;  of Pennsylvania,Dept.andP;  of Computer and Information Science, Moore School, Attn.: ISODEDistribution, 200 S. 33rd St., Philadelphia, Pa.andP;  19104-6314.andP;  The price forversion 6 of ISODE (released January 24, 1990) is $375.andM;A GOSIP GlossaryandM;Association Control Service Element (ACSE) provides services to applications,setting up relationships or associations between communicating applications.andO;ACSE supports all GOSIP applications except the 1984 X.400.andM;Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP), like TCP/IP, uses the datagram methodto route network messages by including addressing information in eachmessage.andP;  Efficient for LAN's, CLNP is preferred in the U.S.andP;  for X.25,whereas connection-oriented messaging is favored in Europe.andM;Connectionless Transport uses the datagram method, as does UDP from theTCP/IP suite, to send network messages by including addressing information ineach message.andM;Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS) allows the Transport layer tobypass CLNP when a single logical X.25 subnetwork is used.andP;  CONS is optionaland does not obviate the requirement for CLNP.andM;Electronic Data Interchange (ANSI X.12) is the standard protocol forelectronic exchange of business documents such as purchase orders, bills oflading, and invoices.andM;End-System-to-Intermediate-System (ES-IS) protocol provides capabilities forhosts (end systems) and routers (intermediate systems) to find one another onthe network.andP;  ES-IS reduces or eliminates the requirement to build staticES-IS routing tables manually.andP;  ES-IS does not handle router-to-routerprotocols; IS-IS does.andM;Fiber Data Distributed Interface (FDDI) is the ANSI standard specifying atoken-passing network that transmits data at 100Mbps over a fiber-optic,dual, counter-rotating ring.andM;File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM) allows network users to transferfiles and access remote files and records in mixed-vendor computingenvironments.andP;  FTAM also includes certain management functions for creatingand controlling access to remote files.andP;  GOSIP 1 has two categories of FTAMsystems: Full-purpose systems support positional file transfer (includingsimple file transfer), and limited-purpose systems support simple filetransfer and management.andP;  FTAM extensions for GOSIP 3 and beyond add errorrecovery, concurrency-control capabilities, and support for new documenttypes.andP;  Other possible additions are full file transfer and access and a filedirectory service.andM;Intermediate-System-to-Intermediate-System (IS-IS) provides dynamic routingbetween routers (intermediate systems).andM;Integrated Services Digital Network allows integration of data, voice, andvideo over the same digital links.andM;Link Access Protocol, Balanced (LAPB) is the link-level protocol used by X.25and ISDN.andP;  LAPB is a suset of High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC).andM;Message-Handling System is based on the CCITT X.400 suite of protocols andprovides electronic messaging between multivendor systems.andP;  The 1984 X.400provides capabilities for handling, transferring, and forwarding messages andis best suited for large hosts and public data networks.andP;  The 1988 X.400defines a new OSI-style architecture using X.500 Directory Services.andP;  Itsupports new message-content types and fits into PC environments.andM;Network Management identifies fault, accounting, configuration, security, andperformance management.andP;  Because a full network-management standard will takeseveral years to complete, an Interim standard will be specified.andM;Office Document Architecture (ODA) provides a common architecture and formatdescription for office documents used by various applications.andP;  ODA formatscover word processing, spreadsheets, simple graphics, fax, and compounddocuments.andM;The Presentation Layer provides for translation of data formats amongmultivendor environments.andP;  The primary task is to ensure that datarepresentation is understood by communicating parties.andM;Remote Operations Service Element supports interactive applications in adistributed, open-systems environment.andP;  It is a principal service fordistributed processing in multivendor environments.andM;Reliable Transfer Service Element (RTSE) provides a reliable transfer serviceto applications.andP;  By recovering from network failures, RTSE minimizes theneed for retransmission.andP;  RTSE is an optional service for the 1988 MHS.andM;Session Layer 5 sets up and manages dialogues (sessions) betweencommunication users.andM;Subnetwork Dependent convergence Facility operates the CLNP over X.25.andM;Transport Layer provides reliable, end-to-end data transport betweencommunicating users.andP;  Class 0 (TP0) provides the simplest transport serviceand is used primarily with CONS.andP;  X.400 requires TP0 for use over X.25 publicdata networks.andP;  Class 4 (TP4) provides the most complex set of transportservices, including multiplexing, error detection, and erro recovery.andM;Virtual Terminal Protocol allows terminals on a multivendor network to accesshosts using a multitude of terminal types and terminal characteristics.andO;GOSIP 2 includes Telnet, Transparent, and form profiles.andP;  Other profiles willbe added in later GOSIPs.andM;X.25 is the standard for wide-area, public-packet switched networks.andM;X.400 Message Handling System is the CCITT recommendation defining the familyof Message-Handling System protocols.andM;X.500 Directory Services provide lookup capabilities for applications.andP;  MHSX.400 can use X.500 to find names and addresses.andP;  Security applications canuse X.500 to determine privileges and access rights.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
