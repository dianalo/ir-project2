(Moorpark, Calif.)andO;and the Plus Passport, from Plus Development Corp. (Milpitas, Calif.) are twoexamples of this type of removable drive.andP;  Both have a maximum capacity of 40megabytes.andM;These removable Winchesters are relatively fast, and they offer goodprotection against contamination of the disk's surfaces.andP;  But they'reexpensive because you have to buy the entire drive mechanism with each disk.andO;The initial setup cost for the Ad-Pack is $580, including disk receptacle,adapter, and cable; each 40-megabyte disk costs $539.andP;  For the Passport theinitial setup is $648 and each disk is $795.andP;  Bottom line: If you expect toneed more than one disk cartridge, the Bernoulli or Sysgen drive willprobably cost you less in the long run.andM;Brier Technology (San Jose, Calif.) provides another variation on theremovable-storage theme.andP;  Brier shipped the first units of its supermicrofloppy, the Flextra, in September.andP;  Brier's drive ($750 to $950) cancram 25 megabytes of data on what looks like a standard 3-1/2-inch floppydisk.andP;  The difference is that special signals embedded in the disk's magneticsurface permit more precise positioning of the read/write mechanism, whichallows denser recording of data.andP;  Brier expects to ship a 50-megabyte unitbefore the end of this year.andP;  You can expect to pay about $20 retail for a25-megabyte disk and $35 for a 50-megabyte disk.andM;Graphics: a voracious storage appetiteandM;However, if you work with a lot of graphic images, even the 40- and50-megabyte capacities of these magnetic-storage options will be taxed.andO;Images have exponentially greater storage requirements than the largelytextual material most people deal with now.andP;  For example, an 8-1/2-by-11-inchimage scanned at a resolution of 300 dots per inch and with 256 shades ofgray will occupy about 8 megabytes of disk space, says Ken Milburn, agraphics consultant in Mill Valley, Calif.andP;  Add color, and you can triple thespace required.andM;For storage needs that run to the hundreds of megabytes, many people arelooking to a technology called magneto-optical.andP;  It is the only type ofrewritable optical storage now available.andP;  A single magneto-optical disk,which looks like a large audio compact disk encased in a cartridge, can storeas much as 325 megabytes of data per side.andP;  The recording surface is firstheated with a laser, then subjected to a magnetic field that switches bits onor off.andP;  The changed magnetism can be read by a laser as data.andM;Sony Corp. of America and Ricoh Corp. were the first to make these drives,but the adoption of standards will attract other vendors.andP;  Standards arecurrently being developed for consideration by the International Organizationfor Standardization and the American National Standards Institute.andM;Cost and speed are the biggest draw-backs of this technology.andP;  The drivescost $4,500 to $6,500 each (plus $200 to $300 per data cartridge), and theyaccess data at about half the speed of fixed hard disks of similar capacity.andO;Many industry analysts believe magneto-optical storage will get faster andcheaper, but not soon.andP;  &quot;It'll be 8 to 10 years before this technology cancompete with magnetic storage,&quot; says Disk/Trend's Porter.andP;  Until then, amagneto-optical drive is useful mainly in archival applications, where itcompetes against the storage cost and access time of paper or microfiche.andM;For strictly archival applications, a new option called Digital Paper may bethe least expensive of all.andP;  Developed by the British firm ICI PLC, thenonrewritable storage medium is a specially coated, flexible polyestermaterial.andP;  Iomega Corp. has been working with ICI to create a Digital Paperversion of the Bernoulli Box.andP;  Iomega expects the hybrid units, which willstore 1.2 gigabytes (1,200 megabytes) on a 5-1/4-inch cartridge, to beavailable before the end of this year.andM;By 1993, predicts Iomega, data storage on magnetic media will cost about $3per megabyte, and magneto-optical storage will cost just 16 cents permegabyte.andP;  But the company expects that Digital Paper drives will store datafor half a cent per megabyte.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
