BarrettStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MCICTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   William McGowan, chairman of MCI Communications Corp., returned to the office five months after undergoing a heart transplant. Mr. McGowan will share power with MCI's vice chairman in a new &quot;office of the chief executive,&quot; the company said.    Mr. McGowan, the driving force at the Washington-based telecommunications concern, will reassume responsibility for long-term strategy. V. Orville Wright, the vice chairman, said that he and Mr. McGowan will &quot;share equally&quot; in all long-term planning. Bert Roberts Jr., president and chief operating officer, will continue to run day-to-day operations, said Mr. Wright, who has been acting chief executive officer since April. Mr. McGowan suffered a heart attack last December.    For now, Mr. McGowan's return to work seems likely to muffle discussion of who might succeed him. His successor &quot;isn't even an issue that's on the table,&quot; said Mr. Wright.    Mr. McGowan's resumption of an active role should also quiet some concerns about the company's leadership and direction. But MCI officials and industry analysts predict Mr. McGowan, 59 years old, will face difficult battles for new business as the company attempts to reverse recent setbacks.    Mr. McGowan plans to work &quot;almost every day,&quot; Mr. Wright said. But the two men expect to share the chief executive's role indefinitely so that Mr. McGowan &quot;will have more latitude to take time off and rest,&quot; Mr. Wright, 67, added.    With Mr. McGowan back, recent speculation about MCI voluntarily merging with another phone company may also subside.    &quot;It's rather unlikely that he would want to report to&quot; another chief executive, said John Bain, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Mr. McGowan was unavailable for comment.    Regardless of Mr. McGowan's formal job description and the power-sharing arrangement, he will again wield vast influence as chief strategist at MCI, analysts said. &quot;When he's there, he dominates the company,&quot; said Harry Newton, a former MCI consultant who publishes Teleconnect, a New York-based trade journal.    Mr. McGowan's most immediate challenge is coming up with ways to attract new business without aggravating persistent price-cutting in the long-distance telephone industry. Mr. Wright said MCI is planning to introduce new services and expand its network, but he declined to elaborate.    &quot;Nobody can survive a price war for much longer,&quot; said Mr. Newton of Teleconnect. &quot;They need to do something with product innovation.&quot; In 1986, MCI had a net loss of $448 million, and operating earnings so far this year generally have lagged or barely matched levels for the comparable year-ago periods.    Mr. McGowan also will spearhead planning on regulatory matters and competition for major contracts, Mr. Bain of Shearson Lehman predicted.    The company recently called for the further deregulation of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., its major competitor, as a means of easing price cutting. MCI is also competing for a share of the $5 billion contract to replace the federal government's phone system. </TEXT></DOC>
