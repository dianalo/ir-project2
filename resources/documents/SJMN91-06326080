Dell, a specialist in fireresistant landscapes in Santa Barbara. However, Dell warns, &quot;No landscapingwill guarantee that a house won't burn down.&quot; In addition to meeting thecriteria developed for fire safety, many of these plants are drought tolerantand easy to care for -- important factors in these times of little water andless time, Dell says. The plants are available at most nurseries.;   Thesespecies are divided by zones, with Zone One closest to the house, and ZoneFour lying farthest away from the residence. The highly successful SantaBarbara Firescape Demonstration Garden is based on this zone planting concept.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  A GUIDE TO PLANTS FOR USE IN A FIRESCAPE: WHICHONES TO CHOOSE, WHY THEY WORK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Landscape  </MEMO><TEXT>  ZONE ONE;   Zone One is the area right around the house. From a fire safetystandpoint the smartest thing you could grow here would be nothing at all. Anyshrubbery near a structure, especially under the eaves, is a fire hazard. Theyoften ignite and carry the fire up into the eaves and into the attic.;  Still, plantings around a house add a lot to its attractiveness and it's clearthat this zone will have to be a compromise. The key here is to use plantsthat are less flammable, keep them watered and pruned, and rely on the firstthree zones to do most of the work of keeping the fire away.;   There arehundreds of plants that would probably be acceptable in Zone One. Some of themore common ones are listed here. Also included is a list of species youshould definitely avoid planting near the house, because of their extremeflammability.; ACCEPTABLE; Agapanthus africanus  Lily of the Nile; Arbutusunedo  Strawberry Tree; Buxus microphylla japonica  Japanese Boxwood;Ceratonia siliqua  Carob Tree; Cercis occidentalis  Western Redbud; Citrusspecies  Orange, Lemon, etc.; Feijoa sellowiana  Pineapple Guava; Ligustrumtexanum  Texas Privet; Macadamia varieties  Macadamia; Magnolia species Magnolia; Metrosideros excelsus  New Zealand Christmas Tree; Myoporum laetum Myoporum; Nerium oleander  Oleander; Olea europea  Olive; Persea americana Avocado; Pittosporum species  Pittosporum; Purnus species  Wild Cherry; Punciagranatum  Pomegranate; Pyracanthe species  Firethorn; Rhamnus alaternus Italian Buckhorn; Schinus molle  California Pepper; Schinus terebenthifolius Brazilian Pepper Tree; Simmondsia chinensis  Jojoba; Tecomaria capensis  CapeHoneysuckle; NOT ACCEPTABLE; Acacia species  Acacia; Bougainvillea species Bougainvillea; Cedrus species  Cedar; Cortaderia species  Pampas Grass;Cupressus species  Cypress; Dodonaea species  Hopseed; Eucalyptus species Eucalyptus; Gelsemium sempervirens  Carolina Jessamine; Hakea suaveolens Hakea; Juniperus species  Juniper; Pennisetum species  Fountain Grass;Phormium species  New Zealand Flax; Pinus species  Pines; ZONE TWO;   Thiszone, the greenbelt, is planted with low-growing herbaceous ground covers thatare very fire-resistant. You'll recognize that many of the plants on this listare succulent, meaning they store water in their tissues. This, of course,makes them more fire resistant. Like the Zone Three plants, they're low infuel volume, so there is less stuff to burn. This zone, properly maintained,has the potential to bring a fire to a screeching halt before it reaches yourhouse. Over the years, some of these plants build up a lot of dead materialunderneath the still-juicy green foliage. This can ignite and spread the fire.Certain plants, like the hottentot fig, must be removed and replantedperiodically to eliminate this hazard. The greenbelt species include:;ACCEPTABLE: Highly fire retardant; Aptenia species  no common name;Carpobrotus edulis  Hottentot Fig; Crassula argentea  Jade Plant; Delospermaalba  White Trailing Ice Plant; Dietes vegeta  Fortnight Lily; Drosanthemumfloribundum; V. roseum  Ice Plant; Lampranthus spectabilis  Trailing IcePlant; Malephora crocea  Ice Plant; Pelargonium peltatum  Ivy Geranium; Sedumspecies  Stonecrop; Moderately fire-resistant; Arctostaphylos species Manzanita; Baccharis pilularis Twin Peaks  Dwarf Coyote Brush; Carissagrandiflora  Natal Plum; Coprosma Verde Vista  Mirror Plant; Gazanialeucoleana  Trailing Gazania; Myoporum parviflorum  Myoporum; Osteospermumfruticosum  Trailing African Daisy; Phyla nodiflora  Lippia; Scaevola MauveClusters  Fanflower; Trifolium fragiferum  O'Connor's Legume; Vinca major, V.minor  Periwinkle; ZONE FOUR;   Farthest from the residence is Zone Four,which consists of thinned native vegetation. Looking at the list you will seethat some natives must be eliminated because they are just too flammable tohave around.;   Others have a high kindling point and are OK in small numbers.Reduce the density of these plants to one specimen spaced every 20 to 40 feet,and keep them clear of dead branches and overgrowth by pruning them annually.;  Clearing Zone Four of so much vegetation will leave the soil exposed topossible soil erosion, especially on steep slopes. Consider the tradeoffbetween fire safety and erosion control, and plan to either leave existingplants in the most susceptible areas, or to plant a cover of Zone Three plantsunder the remaining natives.;   This latter strategy may compromise the firesafety aspect of the planting but also reduces the possibility of a massiveerosion problem, the other bugaboo of living in the chaparral-urbaninterface.;   These are not the only suitable varities, but rather are onesthat have been used with success in the past and are generally considered goodchoices.; ZONE FOUR; ACCEPTABLE PLANTS: thin, prune to reduce fuel; Alnusrhombifolia  White Alder; Arctostaphylos species  Manzanita; Ceanothus species Mountain Lilac; Garrya species  Silktassel; Heteromeles arbuitfolia  Toyon;Malosma laurina  Laurel Sumac; Platanus recemosa  Western Sycamore; Quercusagrifolia  Coast Live Oak; Quercus dumosa  Scrub Oak; Rhamnus californica California Coffeeberry; Rhamnus crocea  Buckthorn; Rhus integrifolia  LemonadeBerry; Rhus ovata  Sugarbush; NOT ACCEPTABLE: Remove these hazardous plants;Adenostoma fasciculatum  Chamise; Artemisia californica  Coast Sagebrush;Eriogonum fasciculatum  California Buckwheat; Salvia species  Sage; The nativevegetation in your area will probably not include all of these plants and willprobably include others not listed here.; (*) Source: &quot;Landscaping forWildfire Protection&quot; by Owen E.
