Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., said U.S. officials, in a verbalcommunique delivered through the International Red Cross two weeksago, offered U.S. aircraft and military honor guard to pick up theremains.   Rowland, along with Reps. Bob Smith, R-N.H., and FrankMcCloskey, D-Ind., has been lobbying State Department officials topursue an offer made to the congressmen by a high-ranking Cambodiandiplomat during the lawmakers' visit to Southeast Asia in January.   Cambodian officials said they were willing to release theremains, but have insisted that U.S. officials receive them, not anintermediary. Rowland said American diplomats had been reluctant topursue the remains question with Cambodia because the United Stateshas no formal diplomatic ties with the Communist regime.   But the congressman said last week that the State Departmentsent the message offering the honor guard and transportation aftertwo high-ranking members of the House Armed Services Committee _Reps. Bill Nichols, D-Ala., and G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery, D-Miss. _also applied pressure on the administration.   David Lambertson, deputy assistant secretary of state for eastAsian and Pacific affairs who has been handling the Cambodianremains issue for the administration, did not return telephonecalls Friday.   A State Department official who spoke on the condition ofanonymity said the Red Cross has ``succeeded in engaging the PhnomPenh regime on this issue (on behalf of the United States) and wehope its going to work itself out.''   ``We are encouraged,'' said the official, who refused to discussdetails of the talks or confirm that U.S. military escorts andaircraft have been offered.   Rowland, Smith and McCloskey in late March sent a telegram toTep Henn, Cambodia's ambassador to Vietnam, saying they would pickup the remains and personal effects. Tep Henn, in a telegram datedApril 21, responded that he found the congressmen's message``encouraging,'' but set no specifics for turning over the bodies.   The congressmen sent another telegram to the ambassador lastweek confirming the State Department's offer and suggesting earlyJune as a possible time for a transfer.   Some have questioned whether Cambodia can have 80 soldiers'remains since the Defense Department estimates that only 82soldiers were lost in Cambodian terrority during the war. No U.S.remains have ever been returned by Cambodia.   The identified remains of 179 U.S. soldiers have been returnedfrom Southeast Asia since 1973 _ 152 from Vietnam, 25 from Laos andtwo from China, according to Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagonspokesman.   The congressional group also hopes to win the release of aColorado man who was arrested in Cambodian territory one year ago.No reason was given for the arrest of Sterling Brian Bono of LasAnimas, and it was not known why the Vietnam veteran was in theregion.</TEXT></DOC>
