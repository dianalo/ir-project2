By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the Constitution's CommerceClause gives Congress the power to strip state governments of theirconstitutional immunity against private lawsuits.   The decision will force Pennsylvania to defend itself against alawsuit by Union Gas. Co. aimed at recovering the clean-up costs thecompany owes the federal government.   Officials from Pennsylvania and 17 other states had told thehight court that a ruling against Pennsylvania could expose statesto $100 billion in Superfund clean-up costs.   Hazardous coal tar from an abandoned Union Gas facility beganseeping into Brodhead Creek near Stroudsburg, Pa., after state floodcontrol officials struck the deposit during excavation in 1980.   Federal environmental officials worked with Pennsylvania to cleanup the problem, at a cost of about $1.4 million.   The federal government then sued Union Gas to recover part of themoney, invoking the Superfund law _ also known as the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.   Union Gas, in turn, sued Pennsylvania. Its lawsuit accused thestate of negligently contributing to the discharge of the hazardousmaterial.   The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruledthat 1986 amendments to the Superfund law eliminated the states'constitutional immunity in such cases and the suit could go forward.   The appeals court said the Constitution's Commerce Clause allowsCongress to eliminate such immunity.   Today, the Supreme Court agreed.   Writing the court's main opinion, Justice William J. Brennan saidthe Superfund law ``renders states liable in money damages infederal court,'' and added that ``Congress has the authority torender them so liable when legislating pursuant to the CommerceClause.''   He was joined fully by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.Blackmun and John Paul Stevens and, in part, by Justice Byron R.White.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to dismiss the suitagainst Pennsylvania. They said the state's immunity should prevail.   Pennsylvania officials, with the support of 17 other states, saidthe appeals court ruling wrongly exposed them to great financialburdens.   Federal environmental officials have listed some 22,000 hazardouswaste sites with clean-up costs approaching $100 billion, the stateofficials said.   Supporting Pennsylvania's appeal were New York, California,Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri,New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina,Utah, Vermont and West Virginia.   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Union Gas, 87-1241.</TEXT></DOC>
