But it ruled that the former ownersare entitled to financial compensation, though Bonn doesn'thave to pay the property's full value.   The landmark decision clarifies the legal status ofroughly one-third of the former East Germany's land and amajor slice of its industry. The ruling could help speed newinvestments into eastern Germany's faltering economy.   The constitutional court upheld a provision in Germany'sUnity Treaty, under which owners of property and factoriesseized by the Soviet military government just after World WarII were denied the right to reclaim their property. Thedecision doesn't affect other claims on smaller businessesnationalized by Communist East Germany after 1949,particularly in the early 1970s.   The Treuhandanstalt, the agency in charge of privatizingstate-run companies in eastern Germany, announced a twobillion mark ($1.13 billion) commercial paper program, thecountry's largest yet. The agency said this will allow an&quot;innovative, flexible and cheap&quot; means of raising short-termfunds to finance its restructuring of the east's economy.                                                                                                          PANDA SEEKS PARTNER IN CHINA                                                                                                          Panda Motors Corp., a U.S.-registered company owned by theSouth Korea-based Unification Church of the Rev. Sun MyungMoon, dropped plans to produce cars in China and is seeking apartner to focus on making parts, the Kyodo news agencyreported. The $1 billion project, which Beijing touted inlate 1989, planned output of 300,000 cars a year, 10 timesthe total produced in China in 1990. But Panda only waslicensed for exports.                                                                                                          ISRAEL WARNED ON UNEMPLOYMENT                                                                                                          Israel's central bank warned that thousands of Israelis,including many new Soviet immigrants, may leave the Jewishstate unless soaring unemployment is stemmed. The Bank ofIsrael reported to parliament that the jobless rate -- 9.7%in the 1990 fourth quarter -- could rise to 14% to 18% infive years if steps aren't taken to create jobs. This isbased on the assumption that one million Soviet Jews willarrive in Israel by 1995 and that 450,000 will join the workforce. Also, 150,000 Israelis are expected to reach workingage by 1995.                                                                                                          THE IRISH PATIENTLY WANT UNITY                                                                                                          Four of every five Irish citizens hope for a unitedIreland but would accept a delay if this would help bringpeace to British-ruled Northern Ireland, a poll found. Only25% of the Irish Times newspaper survey's respondents favoredamending the Irish constitution to remove sovereignty claimson the entire island. Repeal of those provisions could bediscussed as part of all-island political talks to begin nextTuesday on returning some self-government to NorthernIreland.                                                                                                          AFRICA'S PURSUIT OF DEMOCRACY                                                                                                          President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda pledged to movetoward a multiparty system, saying his nation's constitutionwill be amended within a month. Meanwhile, President AndreKolingba of the Central African Republic ordered his nationalassembly to prepare legislation legalizing oppositionparties. The two countries are the latest in Africa to beginshifting from one-party rule.                                                                                                          KOHL FAVORS BERLIN OVER BONN                                                                                                          German Chancellor Helmut Kohl finally backed Berlin ashome to federal government, rather than the former WestGerman provisional capital of Bonn. &quot;It is right, in thereunited Germany, to have the capital and seat of governmentagain in Berlin,&quot; Mr. Kohl said. Parliament is expected todecide the issue in June. The treaty made Berlin the capitalbut didn't tell government agencies to move.                                                                                                          EC MAY ENTER U.K. TAKEOVER ROW                                                                                                          The European Community Commission may become embroiled inan ownership row between Britain and France. It is said to bepreparing to ask London for more data on the way it handlestakeover bids by foreign state-owned companies.   The move follows a complaint by Credit Lyonnais, backed byother French companies, alleging bias by Britain. If thecommission isn't satisfied with Britain's response, it canlaunch a legal challenge. The case stems from Britain'ssubjecting takeover bids by state-owned companies to closerscrutiny, to prevent back-door nationalization.   The EC Commission may ask whether Britain's policies arediscriminatory, which British officials deny, saying similarscrutiny would apply to takeovers by U.K. state-ownedcompanies, though most of British industry has beenprivatized.   The politically charged case highlights the growing debateabout competition policy as the EC moves toward a singlemarket after 1992. Britain argues that state-controlledcompanies have easier access to capital and are at leastpartly sheltered from competitive pressures.

Rich countries that want to protect the world'senvironment should pay poorer Asian nations to preservetropical rain forests and limit pollution, the AsianDevelopment Bank said in its annual Outlook report. . . .Though Pretoria has followed a hands-off policy for severalyears, the last laws allowing racial segregation in SouthAfrican universities will be scrapped during parliament'scurrent session, the education minister said.</TEXT></DOC>
