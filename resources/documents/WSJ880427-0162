In 1970, the total U.S. daily newspaper circulation of 62.1 million was equal to about 98% of the households counted in the census of that year. By 1980, daily circulation had edged up to 62.2 million, according to Editor andamp; Publisher's Yearbook. But that amounted to only 77% of U.S. households at the time. The figure is now 70%. At the current rate of decline, daily newspaper circulation in the year 2000 will be less than 60% of households.    Still, several demographic trends suggest a resurgence for newspaper circulation. Interstate mobility, for example, has recently begun to fall as the baby-boom generation settles down. People who stay longer in a community are more likely to subscribe to the local paper.    Rising educational levels may also play a role. The percentage of adults who are college graduates has been rising; well-educated older people have by far the highest propensity to read daily newspapers.    The Labor Shift   Toward Small Business   FURTHER EVIDENCE of the growing importance of small business: More than half of all private-sector employees now work for companies with fewer than 100 employees. As recently as 1980, according to tabulations of employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), only 48% of the workers in private industry were employed by such small companies.    According to the latest figures, companies that employ 1,000 or more employees had 12.5 million workers in 1986, 9% fewer than in 1980. But in the same period, the employment ranks at companies with fewer than 100 workers jumped by 17%, to 41.1 million. Companies with 100 to 1,000 workers had 26.6 million employees in 1986, 11% more than in 1980.    So, out of a total increase of 8.7 million workers in companies of fewer than 1,000 employees, nearly 70% of the growth was in small concerns with fewer than 100 workers.    Employment trends vary widely depending on the industry. The BLS data show that work in manufacturing companies declined the most -- by 1.8 million jobs between 1980 and 1986, with 71% of the loss coming from companies with 1,000 or more employees. It's no surprise that the mining industry also lost jobs, mostly from the largest firms.    The biggest employment growth came in the service sector and retailing, which together accounted for 77% of all new private-sector jobs since 1980. Service firms in every size class had employment gains.    For Data Fanatics,   Heaven Is Here   THE 1988 EDITION of the Statistical Abstract of the United States has recently become available. Among the 1,425 tables of data:   --There are over five million children under age five whose mother works full time. Two-thirds of these young children are cared for either in their home or at another home, and that care is provided by a relative more than half the time. Child-care centers take care of fewer than one preschool child in three of full-time working mothers.    --Nearly 30% of American workers work on weekends. But they must be taking some time off during the week because the average number of hours spent at work per week is still only 38.7. A majority of retail workers work on weekends, but only about one in 10 manufacturing workers does so.    --More than half (53%) of people age 85 and older who are not living in an institution see or talk to one of their children every day; 63% of them have at least one child less than 30 minutes away. People between 65 and 74 see their children less often, and the kids live farther away; only 40% see or talk to their children every day and only about half of them live within 30 minutes.    --The age distribution of AIDS cases has been remarkably constant between 1981 and 1987: 47% of the cases occur between the ages of 30 and 39, and about 21% are between ages 40 and 49. But the geographic distribution is changing. Prior to 1985 the vast majority of the cases were reported in New York and California. But those states now account for less than half of the new cases. Between 1985 and 1986, the incidence of AIDS increased most rapidly in Texas and Illinois. </TEXT></DOC>
