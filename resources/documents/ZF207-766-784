 Dot matrixprinters are going the way of the daisy wheel, sputtering to a gruesome endat the hands of lethal lasers.andP;  You're thinking that there's nothing newunder the dot matrix sun, and that you may as well skip this section and turnto the real news.andM;Wrong.andM;It's laser printers that are making the dot matrix market so intriguing thisyear.andP;  More to the point, it's the price of lasers that's affecting the dotmatrix printer profoundly.andP;  Laser prices are falling rapidly, and not becausetheir vendors are hacking off vital features.andP;  The 4-page-per-minute HPLaserJet Series IIP (reviewed in this issue) broke the $1,500 barrier withoutlosing any of the capabilities you've come to expect from Hewlett-Packard.andM;Assuming that the new HP IPP's $1,500 list price will shrink to a streetprice of about $1,000 (or about $1,200 with the bottom paper tray most userswill opt to buy), dot matrix printers are going to be squeezed into a rathernarrow price range.andM;That's good news for the buyer, because high-end 24-pin dot matrix models arealready lowering their prices to remain competitive.andP;  Street prices for thesemachines run from about $500 to $1,500.andP;  At the low end, 9-pin dot matrixprinters can't get much cheaper than $150 to $200 (the Epson LX-810 has astreet price of around $175), so companies are piling on features andupgrading construction to attract customers.andM;IT'S ALL IN THE PAPER HANDLINGandM;Undoubtedly you've wondered whether low-end lasers will spell doomsday fordot matrix printers altogether.andP;  Well, don't start digging the grave justyet: dot matrix printers can still pummel lasers in many arenas.andP;  Indeed, dotmatrix printers can handle multipart forms with ease and fussy labels withouta meltdown.andP;  Those with color options make color printing affordable, andwide-carriage models handle monstrous paper up to 16 inches wide.andP;  Try thatwith a laser.andM;So what's your buying strategy for 1989?andP;  If you need a printer with one ofthe matrix-only functions listed above, or if your work is in a heavy-volumeenvironment where speed is a priority, you may still want to buy a high-end24-pin workhorse.andP;  If not, skip straight to a low-end laser and buy one ofthe sturdy new low-end 9-pin models to handle your forms, quick draftprinting, and other nonlaser jobs.andP;  The combined price of the two printersshouldn't be more than the price of one laser just a year ago.andM;The dot matrix sections--monochrome and color--include any printer whosespeed can be measured in characters per second.andP;  That means you'll find9-pins, 24-pins, and ink jets here.andP;  As you read the reviews in this section,you'll notice a few other new developments.andP;  Whereas sophisticated paperhandling used to be an extra on dot matrix models, nowadays even low-end9-pin models have to include it to remain competitive.andP;  Many machines have&quot;zero tear-off&quot;--the printer advances the paper so that you can removefinished output, then backs it up so that you can start printing at the topof the page without losing a single sheet.andP;  And paper parking allows you toprint on single sheets while loaded fanfold paper is retracted; press onebutton and the printer will lock the fanfold back into place.andM;HIGHER IQandM;This year, companies don't stop at paper handling when they try to puttogether a tempting package.andP;  Check out models with multiple paperpaths--front, back, top, bottom--to see if they can make your life anyeasier.andP;  Control panels are becoming better conversationalists, withintelligent LCD windows that flash messages in English rather thanmumbo-jumbo code.andP;  Even front panels with lights or buttons are becoming morestraightforward.andP;  Printer IQ is rising in more ways than one; some printerscan spit out status sheets detailing their current emulation or printsettings to eliminate guesswork.andM;Output quality continues to make progress, but this year's samples stillaren't going to knock you off your feet.andP;  The day when we'll look at a 24-pindot matrix printout and guess that it came from a laser is still far off.andO;Characters are looking darker and sharper than before, but it's not uncommonto see horizontal lines running across the scanned photo in the PC Labs test.andO;For your perusal, we've included samples of the halftone image in our guidesto monochrome dot matrix printers and color dot matrix printers, not becausewe think you should print scanned-in photos with dot matrix machines, but tomake it easier for you to see how different printers handle graphics.andM;Some of the best black-and-white output comes from dot matrix printers withcolor options, so don't forget to give them a look-see.andP;  You'll find thisgroup in our section on color dot matrix printers, and our Printer Guide willshow you output from PC Labs' color test.andP;  Although these printers arefunctionally identical to their noncolor cousins, we've set them apart forthe sake of comparison.andM;Dot matrix printers may be improving, but we never said they were perfect.andO;Noise levels are still headache-inducing on many machines.andP;  But at leastwe'll have something new to write about dot matrix printers next year, wehope.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
