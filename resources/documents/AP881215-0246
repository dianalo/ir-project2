On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forheating oil rose 1.86 cents Wednesday to settle at 51.13 cents agallon, after falling 0.93 cent on profit-taking Tuesday. Othercontract months were up more than a penny.   Prices were higher Monday and Friday on the arrival ofsub-freezing temperatures in the Northeast. The weather remainedcold on Wednesday, and parts of the region were hit with snow.   Andrew Lebow, a senior energy analyst with E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc, said Wednesday's ``heating oil market ...was supported by anticipation of colder weather in the Northeast.''   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchangeWednesday, January unleaded gasoline, which fell 0.90 cent onTuesday, rose 0.42 cent to settle at 43.72 cents a gallon.   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $16.37 a barrel, up 37 centsfrom Tuesday, when it fell 6 cents.   Lebow said the markets also got a boost from reports thatnon-OPEC oil producers Colombia and Norway would be willing to cutproduction if the cartel sticks to an output-slashing pact ratifiedlast month.   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesagreed to keep daily crude production at 18.5 million barrels tohelp prop up sagging worldwide oil prices.   ``Overall, the traders' sentiment seems to be changing. They'remore optimistic OPEC is going to cut production, and there's no signto lead to the contrary,'' said Lebow.</TEXT></DOC>
