Such a strike would use a land-attack variant of the Navy'sTomahawk cruise missile, equipped with a non-nuclear warhead, thatwas first declared fit for use in war in March 1986.   Use of the unmanned Tomahawk is ``a preferred contingency''because of the missile's accuracy and the fact that no pilots wouldbe endangered in bombing runs, the sources added.   The sources, who insisted on anonymity, agreed to discuss theLibyan situation after two Navy F-14 Tomcat jets shot down twoLibyan jet fighters Wednesday in a confrontation over theMediterranean Sea.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in discussing the conflictat a Pentagon briefing, flatly dismissed suggestions the F-14s wereairborne as part of U.S. preparation for mounting an attack on thesuspected chemical weapons plant. Libya says the plant makespharmaceuticals, not chemical weapons.   President Reagan said last month his advisers were consideringsuch a military strike.   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Reagan nowopposes a U.S. military strike against the plant because it wouldcause an international furor that might harm other U.S. interests.The Post cited an unnamed senior administration official who saidReagan was heeding the advice of European allies, particularlyBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that a military responsewould be unhelpful.   The British government said Wednesday night, meanwhile, that ithas confirmed beyond doubt that the plant in dispute was built toproduce chemical weapons.   ``We have been in contact with a number of countries to make thepoint that we have independent information on the Libyan chemicalwarfare programs,'' said a British Foreign Ministry spokesman whospoke on condition of anonymity. ``This information shows that theplant is very large and that there is no doubt it is intended forchemical warfare production.''   Meanwhile today, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleyconfirmed a Los Angeles Times report that Libya has attempted someback-channel contacts with the United States recently, but sherefused to define the substance of the messages or say how they weretransmitted.   The Times, quoting unidentified officials, said the overtureswere rejected because they failed to address U.S. complaints thatGadhafi's regime supports terrorism. It said the most recent Libyancontact came less than 24 hours before the fighters clashed over theMediterranean.   Mrs. Oakley stressed that Libya is well aware that Belgiumrepresents U.S. interests in Tripoli, and should use that channel ifit has any messages to send to the administration.   ``There have been several efforts by Libya over the past year tosend messages to the U.S. government through variousintermediaries,'' she said. ``... The problem is not one ofcommunication; the problem is the policy and the conduct of thegovernment of Libya, their policy particularly in support ofterrorism.   Carlucci said the F-14s were on a routine training flight, morethan 600 miles from the Libyan plant and 70 miles off Libya's coast,when they were approached ``in a hostile manner'' and fired in selfdefense.   ``What he didn't say was that if orders came to attack thatplant, we probably wouldn't use airplanes,'' said one defenseofficial. ``We can use the Tomahawk now.''   The United States wants to prevent Libyan strongman MoammarGadhafi from starting large-scale production of chemical weapons,particularly given Libya's past support of terrorist organizations,the sources said.   The administration is now trying to isolate Libya diplomaticallyand gain the cooperation of allies in denying Libya access toWestern supplies and technology said to be needed for the plant.Secretary of State George P. Shultz plans to address the issueduring an international conference on chemical weapons that opensSaturday in Paris.   ``There won't be any military action before then,'' said oneofficial.   ``But the contingency planning no longer focuses on bombingruns,'' said another source. ``The Tomahawk is mission-capable andwe have the digitized navigation data (for the missile) needed tofly a strike.''   The new plant is situated about 35 miles inland from the coastalcapital of Tripoli. The conventional land-attack model of theTomahawk has a range of 700-plus miles, meaning cruise missilescould easily be launched by either submarine or surface ship againstthe Libyan facility.   When the United States staged a bombing raid over two Libyancities in 1986, it did not have enough conventional Tomahawksavailable to mount the attack. One Air Force F-111 bomber and twoaviators were lost in those bombing runs, which were in retaliationfor alleged Libyan involvement in the bombing of a West Berlindiscotheque frequented by American servicemen.   The Tomahawk is a flying torpedo with short stubby wings and asmall tail fin. Powered by a jet engine, it can fly at extremely lowaltitude just below the speed of sound and is almost impervious toair defenses on the ground.   The missile finds its way with an advanced navigation system andsensors that allow it to follow a pre-programmed computerized map inits memory.   he conventional variant of the Tomahawk costs roughly $1.5million and has never been fired in a conflict. The Navy to date hascertified 35 of its submarines and 23 surface ships to deploy withthe Tomahawk; eventually 100 submarines and 91 surface ships are tocarry the weapon.   According to one Pentagon source, ``the accuracy is such that wecan put a Tomahawk through the goal posts on a football field aftera flight of 500 to 700 miles.''</TEXT></DOC>
