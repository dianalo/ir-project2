The banning is the harshest step taken by the government under its 20-month-old state of emergency. It will all but shut down the United Democratic Front, or UDF, the largest anti-apartheid coalition, and various community, youth and student groups. The regulations also will force the country's largest black labor federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, or Cosatu, to confine itself to labor issues and stay out of politics.    Anti-apartheid leaders predicted the ban will further radicalize the country's 26 million blacks, whose exclusion by the country's five million whites from the central government has made the newly restricted organizations the blacks' only means of political expression. Opposition groups have little choice but to move underground and become more militant, they said.    Two of the country's anti-apartheid leaders, Albertina Sisulu of the UDF and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said the government's action is tantamount to &quot;a declaration of war&quot; against the black opposition. &quot;The government's idea of reform is to smash all effective possible political opposition in the country, no matter how peaceful and lawful, and to rule with a jackboot,&quot; Archbishop Tutu said. Later yesterday, police also issued orders restricting the individual actions of Mrs. Sisulu and several other UDF leaders.    The government said its action was designed to create a peaceful environment under which to proceed with efforts to reform apartheid. Adriaan Vlok, the minister of law and order, said: &quot;I believe that if we succeed in curbing the . . . activities of radicals and revolutionaries in our country, it will lead to a greater stability, to peace, and people will come forward to . . . negotiate with us, to work with us, to better the economic propects of our people.&quot;    The bannings seem timed to stifle black opposition prior to nationwide municipal elections in October. Blacks will be able to vote for their own township councilors, as well as for representatives to the National Statutory Council, a proposed multiracial body that is to advise the government on constitutional changes.    All of the groups covered by the new regulations oppose black participation in local government structures and the council, saying that those who do participate are being co-opted by the apartheid system. They also dismiss the government's reforms as attempts to fine-tune apartheid rather than eliminate it.    The regulations don't ban the affected organizations outright; they can continue with their administrative and bookkeeping functions. But the legislation apparently prohibits them from, among other things, opposing the system of black local government or Pretoria's efforts to negotiate with black moderates; advocating election boycotts; campaigning for the release of political prisoners; calling for disinvestment, sanctions or other measures against South Africa; and organizing commemorations on days with historical significance to the black struggle.    &quot;The result will be, particularly in the labor sector, widespread dissatisfaction among our members, and the government will be forced to use more iron-fisted repression,&quot; said Frank Meintjies, spokesman for Cosatu, which has positioned its 750,000 members at the front of the anti-apartheid struggle. &quot;The end result is going to be conflict, fear and uncertainty.&quot;    Pretoria's action comes two months after the chief of security police, Lt. Gen. Johan van der Merwe, said the government was considering action against various &quot;radical&quot; organizations, including the UDF and Cosatu, which he claimed were acting under orders of outlawed organizations to incite blacks. Yesterday, Mr. van der Merwe quoted Oliver Tambo, exiled president of the banned African National Congress, or ANC, as saying in 1986 that &quot;we had succeeded to create mass democratic organizations&quot; such as the UDF and Cosatu. (Normally, Mr. Tambo, as a banned person, can't be legally quoted in South Africa.)    In ongoing treason trials involving UDF and union leaders, the government is trying to establish a link between the ANC and UDF. The UDF and Cosatu deny they were formed in response to an ANC call to make South Africa &quot;ungovernable.&quot;    At a Johannesburg press conference yesterday, leaders of the affected organizations noted that Pretoria's 1960 banning of the two leading liberation movements of the time, the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress, had prompted both groups to set up exile organizations and form military wings that have waged an anti-government terrorist campaign ever since.    &quot;The government is trying to close all space for the full operation of the democratic movement,&quot; said Seth Mazibuko, an official of the Release Mandela Campaign, which is now apparently prohibited from calling for the release of jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners. &quot;Our fear is that other organizations will open up underground or beyond the country's borders.&quot;    In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the U.S. was &quot;appalled&quot; by Pretoria's crackdown, which he called &quot;a giant step backward.&quot; &quot;By acting to outlaw the non-violent political activity of these organizations, the South African government has dealt a severe blow to efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to South Africa's problems,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
