An ``all clear'' track signal near Boston's Back Bay Station hasbeen changed to require inbound trains to brake to 30 mph, Amtrakspokeswoman Sue Martin said Thursday.   A control system will automatically stop trains that are notslowed, she said.   Amtrak said in a statement that engineer trainee RichardAbramson 41, of Trumbull, Conn., and chief engineer WillisCopeland, 53, of Bethany, Conn., would be ``removed from engineservice.''   But Martin said the suspension was from all duties without payuntil the investigation is completed.   ``This is a pretty routine procedure,'' Martin said. ``Any timethat we suspect that an employee or employees may have contributedto an accident, then they're routinely suspended pending aninvestigation. This does not mean that they're guilty.''   The new yellow and green signal was installed just west ofRuggles Station, about a mile and a quarter from Back Bay Station,Martin said.   The signal was previously green-only, permitting the engineer toreach the maximum legal speed of 100 mph.   ``We've basically taken a step that will add an extra layer ofprotection,'' Martin said.   If the engineer does not apply enough brake pressure to slowdown after passing the signal, an automatic control system willbrake the train and bring it to a complete stop, Martin said.   Amtrak also said it was telling its employees that only federalauthorities can remove train recorders that monitor speed andbraking.   Amtrak officials inadvertently prevented a clear reading of thetape by recording on it an electronic tone to mark the last fivemiles of the trip, federal investigators have said.   The Night Owl, traveling at more than twice the speed limit,derailed and slammed into a crowded commuter train, injuring 267people.   The probe, Amtrak said, is focusing on ``what, if any,responsibility they (the engineers) may have had in the cause ofthe derailment.''   The National Transportation Safety Board also is investigating.The NTSB is focusing on whether the engineers were negligent intheir operation of the train or whether, as the engineers maintain,the locomotive brakes were malfunctioning.   The Night Owl was traveling at 110 mph at some point in themile-and-one-fifth stretch of track before Back Bay Station,according to ``black box'' data retrieved from a tape in thelocomotive's cab.   The maximum speed up to a point about a half mile from thestation was 100 mph. Near the station, the speed limit was 30 mph.   When the 10-car train derailed along a curve, it was traveling77 mph, more than twice the speed limit.   A review of the information taken from the data recorder showedthat the engineers applied the brakes at least once before thecrash, the NTSB said.   If the investigation finds that Copeland and Abramson were notresponsible for the accident, they will return to work and theirback pay will be restored, Martin said.   Both engineers were hospitalized as a result of the accident.Copeland was released from Boston City Hospital on Dec. 17.According to Martin, he was transferred to a hospital in New Haven.Boston City would not confirm the transfer. Abramson was releasedfrom St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
