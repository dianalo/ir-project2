This difference between the macroscopiceconomic indices and the energy consumption is due to the transformationof the industrial structure, changes in types of product manufacturedin various industries, increased efforts for energy saving, and highervalue-added products. The transformation of the industrial structurewas caused by a reduced weight of steel, chemical, and other material-orientedindustries and an increased weight of manipulation and assembly industries.The efforts for energy saving have achieved an about 30% to 50% energycut in manufacturing industries from 1973 to 1984. The causes of highervalue-added products include implementation of rationalization in variousindustries and relatively increased demand for higher value-added productsand services. The difference between the macroscopic economic indicesand the energy consumption will still continue in the future.</TEXT></DOC>
