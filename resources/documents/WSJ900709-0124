Yourexample of Robert McNamara's lying to Congress about the dealto remove missiles from Turkey does not vindicate thepractice of lying. In &quot;Vietnam: A History,&quot; Stanley Karnowreveals that Mr. McNamara also lied to Congress over Americaninvolvement in the South Vietnamese naval operations that ledto the Gulf of Tonkin incident. This pattern of deceit by theexecutive branch led to the passing of the War PowersResolution, the type of clumsy regulation that the Journalfrequently argues against.   The best way to prevent this type of regulation is tofacilitate truthful communication to the public of executiveoperations where propriety is in question. In this manner,information can act as a catalyst for democracy to checkspecific executive policies. This type of check is moreefficient than the long-term regulations resulting fromcongressional dissatisfaction with duplicitous and deceitfulexecutive communications. Testimony before congressionalcommittees not only informs the committee members but also isa process to mobilize the check of democracy.</LP><TEXT>   Mark D. Robins   Chestnut Hill, Mass.   ---   Once again you mounted your bully pulpit to put forthanother Alice-in-Wall-Street-Land argument based on patentlyabsurd analogies.   Notwithstanding the fact that the Iran-Contra affair andthe Cuban missile crisis are about as historically analogousas the invasion of Grenada and the bombing of Hiroshima, youhave gone off the deep end in using such an analogy toattempt to exonerate Mr. Poindexter for his management rolein a scheme in which millions of taxpayer dollars weremisdirected, and from which the profits are still missing.
