We won't feel really good until we launch again.&quot;    Nearly one year after the Challenger shuttle exploded 73 seconds into its flight last Jan. 28, killing all seven astronauts aboard, the U.S. space program still is struggling to recover. There is progress, but it is slow and painful. And some question how quickly the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will be able to rebound from the damage to U.S. space exploration.    &quot;In terms of any sort of rational plan for the future, I don't see it yet,&quot; says New York Rep. Bill Green, the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that handles NASA funding.    NASA insists that it has the right stuff to recover. &quot;Morale is up,&quot; says Richard Truly, the agency's associate administrator for space flight. At the Kennedy Space Center here, where 2,200 workers were laid off because of the accident, limited rehiring has begun for a scheduled shuttle launch early next year. And at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., engineers are working feverishly to redesign the booster-rocket joint that doomed the Challenger.    But few rank-and-file workers believe the next shuttle launch will occur February 1988, as NASA has announced. Doubts persist about the safety of the proposed fix for the booster rockets. The joint redesign, which calls for 15 different changes, already is behind schedule. And NASA officials have come up with 200 other changes that must be made before shuttle flights resume.    Meanwhile, major programs for unmanned space exploration are years behind schedule. The year 1986 had been trumpeted by NASA as &quot;the year of space science,&quot; when an array of sophisticated planetary probes, as well as the superpowerful Hubble Space Telescope, were to be launched from the shuttle. But then the Challenger exploded -- less than two hours before scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., were to hold a final, triumphant news conference on Voyager 2's &quot;'fly-by&quot; of Uranus.    Not only have the launch dates for the unmanned spacecraft been delayed by the grounding of the shuttle fleet, but the careers of many engineers and scientists have been crippled. Some have left and recruiting will be more difficult. &quot;Think about a fresh young engineer coming out of school,&quot; says Richard Terrile, a planetary astronomer at the lab. &quot;You can work for NASA and spend 10 years digging yourself out of a hole . . . or you can work for a computer or technology firm.&quot;    As seen here at the Florida center, the struggling to climb out of the hole goes beyond NASA itself.    A major worry has been the psychological impact of the explosion, especially on the space workers and their children. Most of Brevard County, Fla.'s 49,000 schoolchildren witnessed the disaster, says Lloyd Soughers, superintendent of schools, and he says, &quot;Many are still affected by it.&quot; Layoffs at Kennedy Space Center also fueled anxiety. &quot;We have children whose parents were both laid off,&quot; says Mr. Soughers.    William McGuire, who runs the employee assistance program at the Kennedy Space Center, says in the days after the accident, a few workers showed symptoms of shock -- one had a numb arm, another chest pains for no apparent reason and a third was afraid to return to work. To help relieve stress, he set up a hotline for the first few months after the accident; the &quot;KSC Careline&quot; received 150 to 200 calls.    Resentment still lingers toward the media. Ms. Dixon, the Kennedy Space Center veteran, complains that after the accident, &quot;the press just crucified us.&quot; Reporters swooped down on the space centers, sometimes camping out on the front steps of officials prominent in the investigation. &quot;One time,&quot; recalls a Marshall official, &quot;a bunch of reporters chased (former center director) William Lucas into his garage as he returned from work.&quot;    There also has been an economic price. Following layoffs at the Kennedy center, sales of single-family dwellings in northern Brevard County were down about 50% last year from 1985, says Joseph Catrambone of the Titusville Chamber of Commerce.    Business dropped sharply at area motels, which would have been sold out for the 14 other shuttle launches planned for last year. In Cocoa Beach, Donald Homol, owner of the Sea Missile Motel, has cut room rates $5 to attract customers. Mr. Homol, who sports a gold necklace with a diamond-studded shuttle, has a sign outside his motel that says, &quot;Stay here. Help me pay my bills.&quot;    Beer distributors on Florida's &quot;Space Coast&quot; say beer sales went up but premium beer-sales declined. Overall business dropped at many bars. &quot;We used to get a couple of parties a week, for birthdays, anniversaries, retirements,&quot; says Eileen Byrne, whose uncle owns The Pub, which is frequented by space center workers. Now parties are much rarer, she says.    There are signs that both the people and the economy may be recovering. NASA officials and local mental-health professionals say the Kennedy work force recovered relatively quickly from the accident, but that employees were troubled for months about layoffs. Those fears seemed to ease after the major space-center contractors said their layoffs last September would be their last. And Lockheed Space Operations Co., the contractor responsible for preparing the shuttle for orbit, plans to rehire 90 workers this month; another 700 to 800 will be rehired this summer, if the schedule holds.    &quot;I don't think we'll ever get over the explosion,&quot; says Eleanor Robalewski, a bus driver who ferries workers around the sprawling Florida facility. But, she says, &quot;Everybody is ready to get things going again.&quot;    Public interest in the space program appears the strongest in years. Attendance rose 19% last year to 2.1 million people at the Kennedy visitors' center, Spaceport USA, where &quot;The Dream is Alive,&quot; a film about flying on the shuttle, with the late Challenger astronaut Judith Resnik, has been playing. In Huntsville, Ala., a state-run Space Camp for youngsters, including an imaginary shuttle trip, is setting new attendance records.    The Marshall center in Huntsville and the Johnson Space Center in Houston weren't hit as badly as Florida's Kennedy center because they have been involved in redesign work for the shuttle. At Marshall, where officials were severely criticized for both failing to fix the flawed booster-rocket joint and pushing for a launch in cold weather, the center is setting up a strengthened safety organization led by Alex McCool. Before the accident, the office had 107 people. Now it has 137, with 195 planned by the end of this year.    In addition, James R. Thompson, Marshall's new director, is credited with creating a more open, informal atmosphere than the rigid, militaristic one that prevailed under his predecessor, Mr. Lucas. On Christmas Eve, for example, he invited everyone who was working up to his office for cookies and doughnuts.    Nevertheless, Mr. Thompson says, &quot;Just being open in my personal style won't necessarily give me a more reliable launch vehicle.&quot; He adds, &quot;We have something to prove, not only to NASA but to the country. We've been to our knees before, and gotten up.&quot;    The challenge this time is especially formidable; the National Research Council, a National Academy of Sciences group monitoring the booster redesign, has raised strong concerns about the complexity of the booster redesign, and about whether all the needed safety changes can be made to the shuttle before the first launch.    Many in NASA say that lingering self-doubts, while antithetical to the NASA &quot;can do&quot; tradition, are constructive and will help ensure a return to safe flight. Officials are well aware, says Charles Henschel, a launch recovery director at the Kennedy center, that NASA &quot;can't afford to lose another one.&quot;    ---           NASA's Tentative Launch Schedule for 1988    Date          Orbiter          Payload    Feb. 18       Discovery        NASA tracking satellite    May 26        Atlantis         Pentagon payload    July 28       Columbia         Pentagon payload    Sept. 22      Discovery        NASA tracking satellite    Nov. 17       Atlantis         Hubble Space Telescope   Source: NASA</TEXT></DOC>
