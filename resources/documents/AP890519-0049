(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge has lifted the ban onlogging large tracts of virgin forest but chastised the agency thatadministers them for failing to plan for the protection of a rareowl.   In a major defeat for environmentalists, U.S. District JudgeHelen Frye ruled Thursday against challenges to the Bureau of LandManagement's timber sales plans for the forests of western Oregon.   Pending any further appeals by the environmentalists, the BLMsaid, the ruling clears the way for sale of 337 million board feetof timber that has been tied up in legal challenges since lastsummer.   Frye said the agency's decision not to update the timber plans``was arbitrary and capricious in light of the new, significant,and probably accurate information that the planned logging ofspotted owl habitat raises uncertainty about the ability of thespotted owl to survive as a species.''   Nevertheless, her hands were tied by an amendment to a budgetresolution in Congress that prohibits challenges to the agency'splans, Frye said.   The amendment was pushed through Congress by Sen. Mark Hatfield,R-Ore.   ``At this point, it appears that Sen. Hatfield's legalshenanigans that placed the BLM above the law have worked,'' saidAndy Kerr, conservation director for the Oregon Natural ResourcesCouncil, a co-plaintiff in the case.   Frye's ruling lifted an injunction that had prohibited thelogging of old-growth forests within 2.1 miles of spotted owl nests.   The injunction grew out of a lawsuit brought by the resourcescouncil, the Portland Audubon Society and other environmentalgroups.   Kerr said the groups would appeal the ruling, while pushing forthe listing of the spotted owl under the Engangered Species Act bythe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which estimates there are 2,000to 3,000 pairs of the species left in the Northwest.   Ed Ciliberti, spokesman for the BLM, said his agency would beunable to proceed with the timber sales until Fry signs a summaryjudgment, and said the threatened species recommendation couldforce the BLM to reconsider its plans.   ``I think frankly we're pleased that she's ruled the way shehas,'' he said, ``but I think a substantial statement will have towait until our lawyers review the opinion.''   A timber industry representative said it was too soon for hisside to celebrate.   ``We need to figure out what the ruling means before we canstart dancing,'' said Jim Geisinger, president of the NorthwestForestry   The continuing budget resolution passed by Congress ``prohibitsa judicial challenge to existing timber management plans, butallows a judicial challenge to particular BLM activities on acase-by-case, site-specific basis,'' Frye wrote in her 73-pageopinion.   She noted that the Audubon Society's challenge ``does not seekjudicial review of an activity of the BLM based on site-specificnew information, such as the discovery of a bald eagle nest or anarchaeological `find' or a blow down of timber on a particular salelocation.''   ``They can't challenge our management plans, they have tochallenge individual sales,'' Ciliberti said.   Frye had dismissed the lawsuit in April 1988. But last June the9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction and as a result,the BLM had to cut its planned timber offerings for the year by onethird.   The appeals court returned the case to Frye, who issued apreliminary injunction Feb. 9 that reaffirmed the logging ban.</TEXT></DOC>
