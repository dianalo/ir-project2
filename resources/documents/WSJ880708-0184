Bosch last year sold its 9.3% stake in Borg-Warner Corp. for about $350 million. Chairman Marcus Bierich said profit this year is likely to remain around the level of the past two years, excluding last year's extraordinary gain, while sales are expected to increase about 6% to 27 billion marks ($14.88 billion).    In the first five months of 1988, sales climbed 6.4% from a year earlier, to 11.1 billion marks. In 1987, sales rose 6.5%, to 25.37 billion marks from 23.81 billion marks.    Mr. Bierich said Bosch wants to help Daimler-Benz AG acquire a 30% stake and control of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., the state-controlled aerospace concern. Bosch will either sell its 4.6% stake in MBB to Daimler-Benz or participate in a capital increase, he said.    Daimler-Benz has said that coverage against losses from MBB's stake in the Airbus Industrie consortium is essential to any agreement, and the government is expected to provide a guarantee against Airbus losses. &quot;Released from Airbus and managed according to market principles, MBB is an interesting enterprise,&quot; Mr. Bierich said. Separately, Siemens AG said it will hold on to its 9.32% stake in MBB. </TEXT></DOC>
