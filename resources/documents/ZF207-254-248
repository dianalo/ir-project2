Little in Cambridge, Mass.andM;Sherry believes that although offices will never completely desert their mostbasic form of communication, image processing &quot;substitutes information flowfor paper flow and, as a result, changes the way work is managed,&quot; he said.andM;According to Sherry's research, the amount of paper-based information hasdoubled in the last 19 years.andP;  This amount will double again in six years, hesaid.andM;Image processing won't necessarily reduce the amount of paper in an office,but it will put more effective controls on paper flow, he said.andM;Image processing helps perform many of the same functions for the office thata technique called &quot;just-in-time&quot; (JIT) provides for the manufacturing plant,Sherry said.andM;The JIT methodology used in factories controls manufacturing processes in aseries of tightly linked, integrated steps.andP;  In the same way, imageprocessing can integrate the various processes that govern office paperwork,Sherry said.andM;JIT differs from the manufacturing methodologies that preceded it in that itis a &quot;pull-through&quot; process; that is, workstations request data only whenthey use it.andM;JIT also emphasizes quality control and puts decision-making in the hands ofthe operator of each workstation.andP;  Finally, JIT is used to determine the mostefficient work flow to increase manufacturing throughput without increasingthe capacity of each workstation.andM;Likewise, image processing can increase processing speed in an office,whether or not it increases an individual worker's productivity, Sherry said.andO;&quot;You save 95 percent of the time, which is movement of paper from desk A todesk B,&quot; he said.andM;Like a JIT manufacturing system, an office image processing system canautomatically transfer a task executed on one workstation to the nextavailable worker in the process, saving on the amount of time that paperspends sitting in workers' in-boxes.andM;While the information is being transferred, &quot;the system knows what's going oneverywhere,&quot; Sherry said.andP;  Managers can get an immediate snapshot of thestatus of any particularly piece of &quot;paper&quot; or quickly catch any delays inthe system.andM;With image processing controlling the paper flow, if there is a problem,&quot;everyone knows who is the problem,&quot; Sherry said.andP;  Workers tend to balk atsuch methods of scrutiny, which they see as Orwellian, he said.andP;  &quot;It's all inhow you use it,&quot; he added.andM;For example, if a manager spots repeated delays coming from a workstation, heor she can examine the work that has been done, pinpoint the problem, thendiscuss ways to remedy the situation with the employee.andM;In addition, image management of documents can improve employees' enjoymentof their jobs by helping to eliminate paper-shuffling tasks.andM;&quot;By automating the uninteresting parts of jobs and eliminating papermovement, employers enable employees to do more interesting work,&quot; Sherrysaid.andM;Like the incorporation of JIT at a factory, the installation of an imagingsystem in an office will likely cause changes in the work flow, Sherry said.andO;The process will become more streamlined as unnecessary steps are eliminated.andM;And, in some cases, paper-shuffling procedures can be shifted from sequentialto parallel processes.andP;  If two employees need to perform independent tasks onthe same document, those tasks can be performed simultaneously.andM;Sherry said that, as a result of image processing, corporations may findthemselves with fewer levels in the hierarchy, because streamlined paperprocessing will require fewer middlemen.andM;The increased information available to workers will also give them morecontrol over their work flow, as well as improve the quality of their work,Sherry said.andM;With image processing, managers &quot;have different tools available to them,&quot;Sherry said.andM;Finally, users of both JIT and document image processing put a high value onthe reliability of their systems.andP;  The streamlined processes that they createmean each step in the process must maintain a productive pace.andM;Although image processing systems, like manufacturing systems, can go awry,&quot;they can't go very awry, which is very nice,&quot; Sherry said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
