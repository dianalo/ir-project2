Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said.   ``We are working to try to get the Israelis and the Palestiniansto a dialogue,'' she said. She declined to say whether theadministration thought Palestinians could agree to negotiate withIsrael without a green light from the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   The PLO Central Council, at the end of a two-day meeting Mondayin Baghdad, Iraq, rejected Baker's proposal for implementing anIsraeli election plan on the West Bank and in Gaza.   ``The PLO and the PLO alone has the right to name thePalestinian side to any talks with Israel, whether they bePalestinians inside the occupied territories or outside,'' theCentral Council declaration said.   The Israeli plan, and proposals by Baker and Egyptian PresidentHosni Mubarak to implement it, provide no direct role for the PLOin talks with Israel.   Under Baker's framework, however, Egypt is consulting with thePLO about the Palestinians who would arrange the elections withIsrael. Shamir objects, meanwhile, to Mubarak's effort to includetwo Palestinians who had been deported from the West Bank.   Spokeswoman Tutwiler said Baker ``is still engaged'' withIsraeli and Egyptian officials about the election proposal.However, she added: ``If, in the end, the parties in the area arenot prepared to pursue peace then progress will not be made. Wecannot produce progress on our own if the parties do not have thewill to move ahead.''   Under Shamir's proposal, Palestinians chosen in the ballotingwould make arrangements with Israel for five years of limitedself-rule to be followed by wider negotiations on an overall MiddleEast settlement. Egypt and Jordan, which held Gaza and the WestBank for 20 years, would participate in the talks.   The PLO has denounced the proposal as a device to preclude theestablishment of a Palestinian state. U.S. policy opposes statehoodfor the Palestinians while calling on Israel to relinquishterritory in return for peace.   Spokeswoman Tutwiler said Baker was not discouraged by the PLOCouncil's action. ``Obviously, the Palestinians have to find a wayto respond positively and to move forward,'' the U.S. officialsaid. ``They should have an interest in pursuing peace in arealistic way. ... We do not consider any of these statements to beanybody's last words.''   Baker's five-point proposal includes a three-way meeting inWashington with Israelis and Egyptians before theIsraeli-Palestinian talks. Also, Israel would meet withPalestinians only if it was ``satisfied'' with the composition ofthe delegation.</TEXT></DOC>
