Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said satellites ``are basic tools forhumanity in the search for solutions to hunger.'' But, according toa report he released on existing and future remote sensingcapacities of Earth satellites, funding for the primary U.S.satellite program, Landsat, is uncertain at best.   Hall said the study, ``Satellite Technology and World FoodSecurity,'' ``provides clear evidence that any loss of oursatellite capability will directly affect our ability to avertfamine.   ``This report makes clear the crucial role of the U.S. satelliteLandsat in monitoring food production. The food security communityhas not spoken loudly enough in support of Landsat as Congressdebated its precarious future.''   Hall, who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger,issued the Congressional Research Service study in conjunction withWorld Food Day, which takes place Monday. The study had beenrequested by Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, the committee's formerchairman who died in a plane crash in Africa.   The study said the world's population could nearly triple to 14billion in the next century. And with satellites playing afront-line role in helping predict weather, crop failure andeventual famine, the United States must decide whether it willcontinue building and operating satellites such as Landsat or relymore heavily on foreign data, the report said.   To monitor agricultural and environmental conditions, the UnitedStates primarily uses data from civilian polar orbiting satellitesand from the Landsat program, which has two aging satellites inorbit and a replacement under construction.   United Nations world food groups use data from U.S., EuropeanSpace Agency, French, Japanese and the Soviet satellites.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans aMission to Planet Earth program in the 1990s that will usesatellites to study the Earth's natural systems. But the plan couldcost $15 billion to $30 billion over a 20-year period, and nobudget is yet available, the report said.   Hall said the NASA plan ``must also include activities that willincrease understanding of Earth's capacity to produce sufficientfood.''   The government in 1985 turned over to a private company, Eosat,operation of Landsat 4 and 5. Eosat also received a $250 millionsubsidy and was to build two more satellites.   But Congress and the White House debated funding for thefollowing three years and the Commerce Department announced earlierit had no money to operate the satellites.   The satellites were given a reprieve in June when President Bushsaid he would approve new funds for Landsats 4, 5 and 6. However,the source of that funding is unclear as Congress works on adeficit-reduction package for fiscal 1989.   A July 1991 launch is planned for Landsat 6. But Landsats 4 and5, which have been operating beyond their expected lifetimes, couldcease operation before that time, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
