The usual approach is to decompose the overall probleminto smaller, more manageable subproblems, with an effort to establishcoherence by proper integration of these so as to achieve system objectives.The subsystems are themselves fairly complex, and their management byhumans is either impossible or impractical. The emphasis is on high degreeof automation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts and knowledge basedsystems provide attractive techniques to support the high level of knowledgeor expertise required in achieving successful system integration. TheBoeing AI Center is studying the problems associated with this task.To achieve effective integration, there is a need to define architecturesand organizations which incorporate different control regimes so as toaccount for the diversity of the subsystems. The authors are currentlyinvestigating the usefulness of the blackboard framework in managingcomplex environments. They explore the space station safety advisor forexperimenting with subsystem automation and integration in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
