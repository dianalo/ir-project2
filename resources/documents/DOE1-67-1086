<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-1086 </DOCNO><TEXT>A single-cell Lagrangian model has been developed for calculating theionization and expansion dynamics of high-density clouds in magneticfields or in magnetically confined plasmas. The model was tested by meansof data from magnetospheric barium cloud experiments and approximatelyreproduced such global characteristics as expansion rate, stopping radius,stopping time, and magnetic cavity lifetime. Detailed calculations wereperformed for hydrogen clouds associated with the injection of frozenhydrogen pellets into tokamak plasmas. The dynamic characteristics ofthe cloud expansion, such as ionization radius, stopping time, lifetime,oscillation frequencies, and amplitudes, etc., are computed as functionsof the magnetic field strength, the background plasma temperature, andthe cloud mass. The results are analyzed and compared with experimentalobservations.</TEXT></DOC>
