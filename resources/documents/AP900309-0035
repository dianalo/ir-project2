(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With a stroke of his pen last fall,President Bush invited people fleeing countries where populationcontrol is accomplished by forced abortions and sterilizations toseek asylum in the United States.   But a Chinese family that is apparently the first to accept thatinvitation is beginning to wonder whether it was made sincerely.   The order enabled Li Jin Lin and his family, who previously hadbeen separated and threatened with jail, the right to live and worktemporarily in the United States.   Their application to live here permanently, however, is bound inred tape.   Government officials refuse to say what's holding the case up,but the family's lawyer, Kathleen Rimar, said she is beginning todoubt Bush's commitment to protecting Chinese refugees.   ``These four Chinese people came here right at the worst time,''Rimar said. ``They seem to be the testing case for whether this isgoing to work. So far, I think the executive order isn't doing verywell.''   Bush's directive allows foreign nationals who are fleeing forcedabortion or sterilization policies to apply for political asylum inthe United States.   The directive, though not specifically for Chinese, was part ofa Nov. 30 order allowing many Chinese citizens to remain in theUnited States indefinitely after the June massacre of pro-democracydemonstrators in Beijing.   Bush made the order while vetoing stiff sanctions against China.   Li, a 37-year-old machinist, and his 34-year-old wife, Wang SaiZhen, fled the city of Fuzhou after Ms. Wang became pregnant withthe couple's second child. She had undergone several abortions andwas told another would endanger her life.   The couple and their 19-year-old nephew, Chun Kong Cheung, madetheir way to Canada and paid smugglers about $1,500 each to getthem into the United States, according to the government.   Immigration officers caught them in Albany last March and sentLi back to Canada, allowing his wife to stay temporarily because ofher advanced pregnancy. When Li and his nephew tried to cross theborder again in October, they were thrown in jail.   Li staged a hunger strike and said he would rather serve prisontime in the United States than risk death or sterilization if hewere forced to return to China.   Anti-abortionists took up the cause.   The Rev. Paul Schenck, a local minister involved in OperationRescue, brought the case up with aides to Vice President DanQuayle. Then came Bush's order protecting Chinese refugees.   ``In a very direct sense, (the order) means lives saved,''Schenck said. ``In a broader sense, it equates abortion as one ofthe tools of a repressive government. The same attitude that wouldbring the Chinese government to run over protesters with tanks isthe same malevolence that would lead them to kill nascentchildren.''   Things have improved for the Lis. The Immigration andNaturalization Service allowed them to remain in the United Stateswhile their asylum application was decided. They were freed fromjail, received work permits and settled in New York City.   But the State Department has yet to rule on their asylumrequest, submitted last year, and the regional immigration courtthat must hear their case is in the midst of a reorganization _meaning it may be months before the uncertainty is resolved, Rimarsaid.   John J. Ingham, district director of the INS, said he was notfree to comment on the case. Nat Kingsley, a State Departmentspokesman, said the department's policy is not to comment onindividual asylum cases.</TEXT></DOC>
