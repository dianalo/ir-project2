The Communications Workers of America, which reprsents about130,000 ATandamp;T workers, did not release a breakdown of its nationwidestrike-authorization vote.   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which isnegotiating jointly with CWA and represents an additional 40,000employees, is conducting a separate vote. Strike authorization isexpected.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph's contracts with the two unionsexpire at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday. A company spokesman said he washopeful a new, three-year agreement would be reached this week andthere were indications the unions might not immediately call astrike even if the two sides remained far apart at the deadline.   ``It is routine for the rank-and-file union members to give theleadership such authorization,'' ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said.``It doesn't mean there will be a strike. We look forward to a hardweek, a challenging week of bargaining and are still optimisticthat a settlement can be reached with the unions without a workstoppage.''   A CWA statement stressed that a strike ``is only one of severaltactics to achieve a fair contract.''   Among those tactics is a nationwide labor boycott of ATandamp;T'slong-distance service, a move the unions say will cost the companyupwards of $10 million a month.   The boycott plan calls for the nation's unions and relatedorganizations, which predominately are ATandamp;T customers, totemporarily switch their long-distance calls to non-union USSprint. The unions and the AFL-CIO also have said they will urgetheir major suppliers to boycott ATandamp;T as well.   If ATandamp;T and its unions appear close to an agreement, the unionslikely would agree to negotiate for a day or two past thecontract's expiration.   If, on the other hand, the two sides remain far apart, CWAPresident Morton Bahr and IBEW President John Barry have the powerto decide whether to strike immediately or to implement the boycottplan in hopes of pressuring ATandamp;T into concessions.   Although negotiators have been meeting since March, ATandamp;T has yetto present a formal offer. That should come early this week.   Union officials have said the two sides remain far apart onthree major issues: employee contributions to health insurance, payand job security.   ``At this stage, ATandamp;T has yet to seriously address issues ofconcern to our members, particularly the issue of employmentsecurity,'' Bahr said. ``Management is pushing a package ofsweeping, unacceptable medical cuts and other proposals whichattack seniority.''   Barry issued a statement promising unity among the unions, whichwere bitter rivals at this stage of contract talks three years ago.   ``Together our members are determined to win jobs with justiceand a contract worthy of the skills and productivity of ourmembers,'' he said.   In 1986, CWA struck ATandamp;T for 26 days but the company was able tokeep half of its manufacturing plants open because the IBEW agreedto work provided its members were given any added benefits CWA wonthrough its strike.</TEXT></DOC>
