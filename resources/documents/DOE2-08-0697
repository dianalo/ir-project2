<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-08-0697 </DOCNO><TEXT>By including the electric dipole operator among the generators, the sp(6,R) algebra of the nuclear symplectic model is extended to the semidirectsum algebra wsp(6, R) = w(3) sp(6, R), where w(3) is a Heisenberg-Weylalgebra spanned by three pairs of boson creation and annihilation operatorsand the unit operator. The mathematics of the extended model is studiedin detail and techniques are provided to perform numerical applicationsof the latter. The wsp(6, R) irreducible representations realized inthe model are shown to be positive discrete series ones, which can belabelled by their lowest weight. The branching rule and the raising operatorsfor the wsp(6, R){contains}sp(6,R) chain are obtained. Various basesare constructed in the carrier space of a wsp(6, R) irreducible representationand the corresponding matrix representation of the generators are determined.For this purpose, use is made of a Dyson boson relization of wsp(6, R).Finally, the choice of a physically relevant wsp96, R) irreducible representationand of a phenomenological collective Hamiltonian in the enveloping algebraof wsp(6, R) is reviewed. copyright 1988 Academic Press, Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
