Waite was on his fifth mission as personal representative ofArchbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie when he dropped from sightJan. 20, 1987, in Moslem west Beirut.   He was last seen leaving the seaside Riviera Hotel at 7:30 p.m.to meet the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers of two Americans.   In England, Waite's family observed the birthday quietly,praying for his safe return.   His wife Frances and brother David had an ``entirely private''meeting with Runcie at Lambeth Palace, the archbishop's residence,a church spokeswoman said.   David Waite said the family believes his brother is alive. ``Ourfaith takes the pressure out and we can relax in the knowledge thatat the right time Terry will be released,'' he said.   On the night he disappeared, the policeman's son who became aspiritual leader's personal emissary told his Druse bodyguards hedid not want them to escort him to the clandestine meeting.   Well-informed sources said Waite was driven to the home of aShiite Moslem physician who had acted as go-between. He apparentlywas to make contact with representatives of Islamic Jihad, whichholds U.S. hostages Terry A. Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.   Waite never returned.   Nothing has been heard of him since. No group claims to holdhim, the British government says no ransom demands have been madeand there have been no photographs or videotapes from thekidnappers to prove he is alive.   Other Western hostages freed since, however, have reportedseeing a man believed to be the bearded, 6-foot-7 Briton in anunderground prison.   Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt claimed Waite was held by thepro-Iranian Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella group forkidnappers holding most of the 18 missing Westerners. Hezbollahdenied it.   Many rumors circulated after Waite's disappearance. He wasreported ill, released, killed, wounded while trying to escape andsmuggled to Iran.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
