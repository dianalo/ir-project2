The order marks the first time in recent history that a sophisticated Western jetliner, instead of a Soviet-built plane, was ordered by an East bloc airline.    The Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, cleared the order June 15, provided the planes are maintained in the West. Cocom, which consists of Japan and most of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization members, clears transfers of sensitive technology to Soviet bloc countries. The purchase contract was signed Friday. The twin-engined planes, which carry a sticker price of $60 million each, will be equipped with General Electric Co. CF6-80 engines.    It isn't known how Interflug is financing the purchase. Banking sources in Frankfurt, West Germany, said they offered financing to Interflug and were told the airline planned to pay cash. But there have been rumors in West Germany that the sale was linked to a one billion mark ($556.8 million) credit being arranged for East Germany by a consortium led by Deutsche Bank AG. Aides to Bavarian Governor Franz Josef Strauss denied any such link and said Interflug secured its own financing. Lufthansa, West Germany's flagship airline, will maintain and overhaul Interflug's Airbuses, according to a recent contract between the two carriers.    Lufthansa, which operates 10 A-310s, also will help train Interflug crews. </TEXT></DOC>
