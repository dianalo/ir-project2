No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricanearound noon.   For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearingbranches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper throughthe air.   The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston'sairport and aircraft parked on its fields.   The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across thecity. Skies brightened, the winds died down and people waited foran hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived.   All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami InternationalAirport.   Flights from the Cayman Islands, reportedly next in the path ofthe hurricane, arrived in Miami packed with travelers cutting shorttheir vacations. ``People were running around in the main lobby ofour hotel (on Grand Cayman Island) like chickens with their headscut off,'' said one man.   A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was movingwest at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. It saidJamaica would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would causeflash floods and mud slides.   ``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said BobSheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.   ``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across thatisland, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerfulhurricane,'' he said.   Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico,Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issuedMonday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the CaymanIslands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for theDominican Republic.   High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingstonovernight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and litteringstreets with branches.   Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding upwindows in preparation for the hurricane.   The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of themountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as muchdamage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urgedresidents to seek higher ground.   Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people wereevacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation'ssoutheastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush theisland.   In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay,Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken variousprecautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of thehurricane.   Lt. Ken Ross, a spokesman, said the Navy station at Guantanamoreported that as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the brunt of the storm appearedto be passing southeastern Cuba. ``They have reported maximum windsof 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots,'' said Ross. ``But there areno reports of injuries or damage.''   The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved to``Condition Two,'' meaning electrical power usage was cut back toonly essential uses and ``all non-essential personnel sent to theirbarracks.''   The storm also skirted Puerto Rico without causing any damage tomilitary facilities, Ross said.   Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the CaymanIslands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veernorthwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Residents of theneighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, wereurged to ``rush all preparatory actions.''   The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans couldexpect high waters and large waves ``which may undermine buildingsalong the beaches.''   ``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue tomonitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the serviceadvised.   Forecaster Hal Gerrish on Sunday described Gilbert ``certainlyone of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a longtime.''</TEXT></DOC>
