After months of sleeping wherever he could -- bushes, cars, inthe back of derelict taxis in a parking lot -- and living in the rotatingchurch homeless shelter program in Los Altos called Alpha Omega, Brown hasfound a home in Mountain View, on a quiet, tree-lined street close todowntown.;   &quot;The first day I woke up here I stayed at home all day; I don'tcome out,&quot; said Brown, his accent rich with the tones of his native St. Kittsin the Caribbean. &quot;At the shelter you have to leave by 7.30 a.m., and I lookup and it was 10 a.m. I say, 'This is my place. What am I worried about?' Irolled back over, I sleep in my bedroom, I roll over again and sleep in theliving room. I sleep all over the house.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYSTO FORMER SHELTER DENIZEN, A ROOF OVER HIS HEADMEANS MORE THAN JUST PROTECTION FROM ELEMENTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  First of two articles  </MEMO><TEXT>     It's been a long, strange trip back from despair for Brown, 57, who after adevastating personal tragedy lost his job as a cook with Air France, his homeand his will to succeed. But after years of &quot;swimming around on the bottom&quot; --as Brown puts it -- he's now back up and has high hopes for the future. He hasa two-bedroom, one-bath home that costs him $800 a month, furniture, a steadyjob as a chef for the priests at St. Joseph's in Mountain View, a TV set,heat, more friends than he can count on both hands, money in his pocket --&quot;not enough, but some,&quot; he says -- and his work helping other people who havehit bottom. This, he says, gives him the greatest joy of all.;   &quot;Maybe inanother year I be so far up I won't look down to see where my shadow used tobe,&quot; he said.;   I first caught up with Brown exactly a year ago when he wasliving in the Alpha Omega shelter and thrilling other residents and churchvolunteers with his culinary abilities. He had impressed me as a fine personstruggling with some inner demons, and I had been captivated by his warmth andgood nature. The photograph accompanying my story about the shelter last yearshowed Brown in his chef's uniform grinning from ear to ear and hugging avolunteer. It had caught a fine moment in his life -- he told me later -- whenhe had just learned that he had a job.;   This Christmas I thought it was timeto catch up with him again to find out which side of his personal battle hadtriumphed -- whether he had sunk or swum.;   Even though the photograph from ayear ago showed Brown smiling, he was still emerging from the dark tunnel thatwas his life. His personal tragedy haunted him, and he credits the shelter andall the people who helped him for turning his fate around.;   &quot;It wassomeplace where you can keep your pride, retain your dignity. The shelter gaveme the ability to fight back. I try to pass that on. If I see a homelessperson on the streets and I think he be serious about getting back, I tellhim, 'Man, you come with me, I show you a great place!' &quot; Brown said.;  Brown's rise from the bottom, unfortunately, is not typical of homelesspeople. Tom Pamilla, executive director of Community Services Agency inMountain View, who oversees the Alpha Omega shelter program, said the needincreases each year and that the agency has to run very fast just to stay inplace. This year, for example, the agency saw 1,000 more people than in 1990who were in need of food, clothing and shelter.;   The Alpha Omega program isa bright spot, but even there, success is often elusive.;   &quot;It depends onyour definition of success,&quot; Pamilla said. &quot;Everyone who goes into thatprogram gets a strong dose of care; they're treated with dignity. That's thesuccess I look for. But how many of them get a job? How many get an apartment?I don't know, maybe half.&quot;;   Mary Burkhardt, development director of CSA, hasa slightly more optimistic estimate of 60 percent, although she was quick toadd that any statistic would be a guess because it is often difficult keepingtrack of residents once they leave. As the shelter enters its third year,however, Los Altos residents continue to support the program not just withtheir money -- it is run entirely on donations -- but also with their time.;  &quot;Prior to the shelter we were wringing our hands. We knew the homeless wereout there, but we didn't know how to reach them,&quot; Burkhardt said. &quot;Thisprogram actually allows us to help them with things like getting them in touchwith drug and alcohol programs or helping to do a resume. There's a personalcontact there.&quot;;   The shelter has made many of the wealthy volunteers searchtheir souls. &quot;There are a lot of pitfalls. You sort of live and die withthem,&quot; Burkhardt said. &quot;You live and die with their problems. Those problemsbecome yours.&quot;;   &quot;We have had some failures. I'm sure those people werelaughing at us behind our backs, but who cares? I'd rather err on that sidethan turn my back,&quot; she said.;   The Los Altos program -- which has athree-prong administration including CSA, 12 churches and the volunteers --has inspired other communities. Cupertino and Sunnyvale churches have openedtheir own shelter program, as has the Willow Glen area of San Jose. Burkhardthas advised a proposed homeless shelter in Marin County's Tiburon, though theplans were thwarted by residents who didn't want homeless people in theircommunity, and communities in Colorado that were thinking of starting churchshelters.;   The shelter program is funded entirely from the church collectionplate. Burkhardt estimated that each church needs $1,000 a month for suppliessuch as toilet articles, socks, underwear, coffee, sleeping bags and beddingfor the 15-person shelter. Another key to its success has been the support ofthe city council, Burkhardt added.;   As a graduate, Brown has become amainstay of the shelter program. He has an uncanny knack for spotting homelesspeople who sincerely wish to turn their lives around and has become one of theshelter's most intuitive screeners.;   Not all rosy;   His purpose now, hesays, is to help others. He has taken several people into his home and hassuffered as a result of his kindness -- one man he helped repaid him byrunning up a large phone bill, then leaving. Brown has not been able to gethis telephone reinstalled.;   But the rip-offs are balanced by theappreciation, and Brown has a pile of thank-you notes from elderly shut-ins inLos Altos and Mountain View, whom he cooks for at Thanksgiving and Christmas.Another friend whom he urged to seek help for her drug addiction recentlycompleted a treatment program and sent him a note:;   &quot;I just hope you knowthat you gave me the best thing anyone could have given me (a chance). . . . Ihave to learn to live life one day at a time, it'll work better that way,especially for my state of mind. I am no longer as angry as I used to be,&quot; shewrote.;   He recently invited a battered woman and her two children to livewith him because they had no place else to go.;   &quot;You can't save everybody,&quot;Brown said. &quot;You're lucky if you can pull yourself out of the mud. We are alldrowning slowly -- society is taking care of that -- but I've got ninesisters. If I turn down a woman who needs help I could never come home again.They'd never let me in.&quot;;   A fresh start; When she first arrived at hishouse, Brown told her, &quot;The past cannot come in here -- you leave that at thefront door.&quot; She and her kids have been there for a week, and Brown is waitingto see how it turns out.;   Brown said his brush with the bottom has changedhis values forever. &quot;When I was working for the airline, I was making moneyand I don't look at society,&quot; Brown said. &quot;I was living high on the hog. I nolonger work for these middle-class things. I'll make it OK, but I don't havethe same attitude again.&quot;;   Whereas before Brown may have wished for fancierpossessions, he is now happy with the furniture that has been donated to himby friends: a sofa-bed, a dining-room table and four chairs, mismatched lamps,and a couple of bookcases.;   &quot;I got everything I need!&quot; he beamed.;  Symbolic, perhaps, of his newfound life is the mailbox outside his frontporch. On this he has proudly and sturdily taped his name, like stamping hisexistence on the neighborhood, proof even to himself that this is now home.;  &quot;I walk up and down the street,&quot; he said, &quot;and people call to me by name. I amtheir neighbor!&quot;;   NEXT WEEK: Two other Alpha Omega shelter residents telltheir stories.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Those wishing to donate to the sheltermay send checks to Community Services Agency, 204 Stierlin Road, Mountain View94043, marked for Alpha Omega shelter.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Carole Rafferty column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911225  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,631  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 25, 199100360252,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
