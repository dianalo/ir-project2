While the people at these &quot;drug&quot; companies seem to be ableto condone almost 500,000 American deaths each year as a partof the cost of doing business, I cannot. We will not purchaseany Kraft, General Foods or other subsidiary products ofthese death merchants. Someone has to tell them, &quot;Hell, no]We've had enough]&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Dave Johnson   Vice President, Operations   Microware Associates   Arlington, Texas   ---   I had to laugh when your March 28 article &quot;TobaccoConcerns Are Hopeful About `De-Nicotined' Cigarettes&quot;mentioned that a spokesman for Philip Morris claimed thatcigarettes &quot;are the most highly regulated consumer product inthe country.&quot; On the contrary, words like &quot;exemption&quot; and&quot;grandfathered-in&quot; apply more to tobacco products thananything else in this country. After all, what other industrycontinues to get away with the annual genocide of almost500,000 Americans each year?   DeWayne Baumgartner   Fort Worth, Texas   ---   My reaction to the story of the new ad campaign fromPhilip Morris now under way in Tampa and Arizona was one ofbeing insulted. Philip Morris is insulting everyone'sintelligence.   Since the earliest medical studies on the effects ofsmoking and health it has been widely reported that numerouschemical and organic compounds in cigarette smoke -- directto the smokers, secondhand to nonsmokers -- cause emphysemaand lung cancer. We now have that master of PR non-speak,Philip Morris, test-marketing a de-nicotined cigarette andfeigning to not actively promote this fact as a health claim.Will the hidden persuading intent of these ads attempt tomake cigarette use seem less of a health hazard under theguise of offering the &quot;niche&quot; smoker a product being comparedwith decaffeinated coffee, a product that is medicallyaccepted as healthier than normal coffee?
