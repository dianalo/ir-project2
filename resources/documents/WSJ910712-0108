Alcoa was also charged with disposing of causticmaterials in manholes at the plant without a permit in June1988.   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams heralded thecriminal penalty as the largest ever in a hazardous-wastecase, surpassing the $3 million levied against UnitedTechnologies and the $1.15 million against Eastman Kodak Co.However, analysts dismissed the fine as pocket change for thealuminum giant, especially because Alcoa will not pay cleanupfees. In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,Alcoa shares were quoted at $69.375, up $1.375.   Alcoa said the fine had already been covered by the $50million it pledged last month to spend for environmentalremediation at the Massena plant. The amount was accountedfor as part of a charge against 1990 fourth-quarter earnings.   Still, the guilty plea, reached after months ofnegotiations, comes as a setback for Alcoa Chairman Paul H.O'Neill, who has made environmentalism and worker safety toppriorities. &quot;Alcoa has a clear environmental policy which wasnot followed in this instance,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said in astatement. &quot;With this unfortunate episode behind us, we cannow turn our full attention to meeting our environmentalobligations.&quot;   Alcoa has been operating its Massena facility, whichincludes an aluminum smelter and extrusion plant, for 87years.   The current fines aren't the only payments Alcoa isexpected to make in Massena. Alcoa, along with ReynoldsMetals Co. and General Motors Corp., which also have plantsin Massena, are funding a study that will assess furthercleanup penalties under state and federal superfund laws.   ---   MONEY CAN'T BE LAUNDERED in a safe deposit box, appealscourt rules.   Keeping money from criminal activity in a bank safedeposit box doesn't constitute money laundering under thefederal statute, the Chicago federal appellate court ruled.   In what is apparently the first appeals court decision onthe issue, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that aconvicted Milwaukee crack dealer's use of the box to storemoney didn't violate the law.   Under the statute, money laundering is a transaction inwhich a criminal attempts to conceal &quot;the nature, thelocation, the source, the ownership or the control&quot; ofillegally gotten money. &quot;The placing of money and orwithdrawing of money from a safe deposit box where no recordis made and no interest is paid . . . cannot be considered a`banking transaction,' &quot; the court wrote in an opinion byJudge John L. Coffey.   The U.S. attorney's office in the eastern district ofWisconsin had argued that the word &quot;transaction&quot; should bebroadly interpreted to include all kinds of money transfersin and out of a financial institution. It had argued that noone reasonably would keep large amounts of cash in a safedeposit box unless he was trying to hide it.   Defense lawyer Michael L. Chernin argued that moneylaundering must involve a change in the nature of the moneyin an attempt to hide it, as in turning cash into a cashier'scheck to disguise its origin.   ---   FDIC LOSES CASE brought by MCorp unit.   In a pretrial summary judgment, a federal judge ruledagainst the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in a dispute withan MCorp subsidiary stemming from the banking company's 1989collapse.   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Porter ruled that regulatorsviolated federal banking law by refusing to return all $17.1million in federal funds lent by the subsidiary, MBank NewBraunfels, to the flagship Dallas bank after the Dallas bankwas declared insolvent in March 1989. The FDIC argued thatthe New Braunfels unit was entitled to only 80% of its funds,or the amount creditors would receive if the Dallas unit wereliquidated.   Because regulators allowed unaffiliated MBank Dallascreditors to recover 100 cents on the dollar, the moveviolated the National Bank Act's edict to treat all creditorsalike, Judge Porter wrote.   In February, Judge Porter ruled against regulators in asimilar lawsuit filed by MCorp, which is now operating underbankruptcy-court protection. MCorp charged that regulators'actions caused the failure of 12 otherwise solvent banks. Atotal of 20 of MCorp's 25 banks were seized and later sold toBanc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio.   Judge Porter has asked the parties in both lawsuits tosubmit briefs on damages.   A spokesman for the FDIC said it is likely that the agencywill appeal the decision. &quot;We disagree with the judge'sruling,&quot; the spokesman said. An appeal of a similar ruling inan unrelated Texas bank case already is pending before thefederal appeals court in New Orleans.   ---   RACKETEERING GUILTY PLEA entered by president of fabriccompany.   Bernard Korostoff, 66 years old, the president and ownerof Kaye Mills International Corp., pleaded guilty to onecount of racketeering. Mr. Korostoff admitted he conspired tocommit bank fraud with Michael Weinstein, the founder andchairman of Coated Sales Inc., a now-defunct New Jerseytextile company that declared bankruptcy in June 1988.   Mr. Korostoff is the sixth official associated with CoatedSales to plead guilty to various counts of bank, securities,and stock fraud in a widespread government investigation. Headmitted to drawing up false invoices showing that KayeMills, based in New York, had purchased fabric from CoatedSales. These sales never took place, but Coated Sales usedthe invoices to obtain funds from Midlantic Commercial Co.and to inflate sales figures in corporate reports. Mr.Korostoff said that Mr. Weinstein paid him a commission of1.5% of the amount reported on the false invoices.   In Oct. 1990, as the federal investigation was beginning,Mr. Korostoff insisted that he had done nothing wrong. OnWednesday, however, he described the racketeering scheme indetail. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and$250,000 in fines.   Mr. Korostoff's attorney, Arnold Burns, of the New Yorkfirm Proskauer Rose Goetz andamp; Mendelsohn, declined to commenton the plea, saying only that sentencing would probably bepostponed until after Mr. Weinstein's trial, which isscheduled for September.   ---   NOTED: Chief Judge Charles Clark of the 5th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals in New Orleans said this week that he willretire next Jan. 15 and return to private law practice inJackson, Miss.
