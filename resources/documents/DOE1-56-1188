The experimentally determined mass transfer coefficients (Sherwoodnumbers) confirm well-known correlations, as well as the statements ofthe Levich-type description of falling film heat and mass transfer, thatis, the damping of the turbulence not only near the wall but also inthe vicinity of the film surface. So, the assumption that the bulk andthe surface temperatures of the film are equal, owing to undamped eddytransport, is not correct. The experimentally determined heat transfercoefficients deviate from the experimental data of Blangetti, the latterdetermined in film condensation of 1-methoxy-2-propanol-water azetrope(MWA). This discrepancy is due to the thermal entrance effects in theexperiments of Blangetti and will be discussed in Part 2.</TEXT></DOC>
