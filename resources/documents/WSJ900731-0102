But despite the ubiquitous slogan -- on banners draped athearings and on buttons pinned to blazer lapels -- lawmakersare pushing criminal statutes that won't have much effect onanyone associated with the savings-and-loan debacle of the1980s.</LP><TEXT>   Life prison terms for &quot;Sandamp;L kingpins,&quot; stiff new mandatoryminimum sentences for other &quot;Sandamp;L violators,&quot; new criminalstatutes for obstructing government regulators -- these arejust a few elements of what's being presented as a punitivepanacea on Capitol Hill.   &quot;Whether bank robbers steal their loot with a pistol orwith a pencil, they should serve hard time,&quot; declares SenateJudiciary Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.).   What Sen. Biden and other lawmakers fail to stress intheir get-tough admonitions is that the proposed new criminaloffenses and penalties wouldn't apply retroactively. Thatmeans that any criminal acts committed before President Bushsigns new Sandamp;L enforcement provisions -- which he would do atthe earliest this fall -- wouldn't be covered by the newlaws.   &quot;It is misleading to justify new criminal penalties on thenotion that they will be used to punish the people whoallegedly caused these losses,&quot; says John Villa, a Washingtonlawyer. &quot;New criminal statutes and increased penalties do notapply retroactively to past conduct&quot; under the constitutionalprohibition of &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws.   Lawmakers are creating &quot;a smokescreen to shift theculpability for the Sandamp;L mess from the Congress and onto a fewunscrupulous businessmen,&quot; says Sen. William Armstrong (R.,Colo.), the lone dissenter in the Senate's 99-1 vote on thethrift enforcement measures. &quot;The fact is the Sandamp;L mess . . .was not primarily the result of wrongdoing of a few thriftexecutives, but of a collapse of a thrift system establishedby and overseen by the Congress.&quot;   Robert Davis, a senior Justice Department official in theReagan administration who now practices privately in Dallas,says Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also deserves blame fororchestrating news conferences announcing Sandamp;L indictments --an effort to counter Democratic charges of lax Sandamp;Lprosecution. &quot;He's distorting things; criminality had to dowith only 5% of the losses,&quot; says the lawyer, citing anestimate used by some private consultants. Mr. Thornburghputs the figure at 30%, while civil regulators say it's 50%or 60%.   In contrast to the criminal counterparts,civil-enforcement measures moving through Congress could havea Draconian impact. Such provisions as those expandingprosecutors' ability to freeze and forfeit personal assets ofofficers and directors of failed thrifts &quot;could destroysomeone who made bad {but not criminal} business decisions,&quot;says David Baris, executive director of a Washington tradeassociation that represents bank and thrift directors.   To be sure, proposed funding authorizations for the hiringof hundreds of federal agents and prosecutors would enablethe Justice Department to chip away at mountainous backlogsof financial fraud cases. And certainly, were there ever arepeat of the Sandamp;L blow-out, lawmakers would be lambasted ifthey hadn't increased criminal penalties.   But given the likely future state of the thrift industry-- greatly consolidated and more rigorously regulated -- thebulk of the proposed criminal legislation appears to be morebackward-looking rhetoric than substantive cure or deterrent.   Some provisions approved by the House Judiciary Committee-- such as a ban on obstructing regulators -- createredundant criminal statutes for acts already prosecutableunder existing fraud law.   Other measures are entirely bureaucratic in nature. Boththe House and Senate legislation would establish a FinancialInstitutions Fraud Unit within the Justice Department tocoordinate Sandamp;L fraud prosecutions. The department createdsuch a unit on its own months ago.   Prosecutors are happy about proposals to strengthenprocedural weapons in financial fraud cases, such as the pushto expand the applicability of the federal anti-racketeeringlaw to bank and thrift fraud.   But some of the new legal weapons aren't well suited tothese crimes. At the Justice Department's behest, lawmakersin the House and Senate have proposed to expand wire-tapauthority to investigate thrift crime. But prosecutors andagents privately admit that such surveillance is rarely, ifever, possible in cases that typically involve recreatingintricate paper trails long after suspicious transactionshave occurred.   The Justice Department vehemently opposes a House proposalto create a bi-partisan national commission to investigatethe causes of the Sandamp;L crisis and propose solutions. &quot;Such acommission would not . . . make any meaningful contribution,&quot;but would result in considerable second-guessing ofenforcement efforts, charges James Richmond, the department'srecently named special counsel for financial fraud.   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), prime sponsor of theHouse legislation, defends the commission as a cornerstone ofrestoring the thrift industry and preventing future crises.The panel, he says, will enable all involved &quot;to move forwardto solve rather than snipe.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
