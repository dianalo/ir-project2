The two states are promoting themselves as ideal locations for a new kind of spaceport that would serve as the launching pad for privately financed space shots. Space Services and a handful of similar companies that launch satellites and space probes are the target clients.    Hawaii has been quickest off the mark. Its prime site is 11,000 acres of farmland on the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii. The state plans up to four launch pads and expects to be in business by 1992; the spaceport probably would be operated jointly by the state and private companies.    Hawaii's big advantage is geography: Because it's closest to the equator, launches from Hawaii require less fuel than from other parts of the U.S. And, says Mr. Slayton, &quot;The neat thing about Hawaii is, you can go in any direction without worrying about where your (rocket) stage is going to impact, because you've got ocean everywhere.&quot;    Florida Gov. Bob Martinez says a private spaceport in his state could piggyback on the Cape Canaveral infrastructure. He's asked the legislature for $500,000 to study the project. Playing the state's own geographical card, Jon Peck, the governor's spokesman, says, &quot;It's a lot easier to get to Florida from Michigan or Texas than it is to get to Hawaii from anywhere.&quot;    Firms Must File Report   To Sue in Minnesota   ATTENTION, out-of-state companies doing business in Minnesota: If you want the right to sue someone in Minnesota at a future date, say to enforce a contract or collect a past-due debt, a little paperwork needs attending to right now.    A new law requires nonresident corporations to file a one-page &quot;business activity report&quot; laying out the extent of the company's local assets, sales and other activities. Officials say they want to know whether any of these out-of-state companies should be paying local income taxes. Companies that already file Minnesota taxes are exempt.    If the company doesn't file the annual report within 3 1/2 months after its calendar or fiscal year ends, it loses the right to sue. The law is patterned after a four-year-old New Jersey statute, which is about to be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.    In the New Jersey case, a Florida corporation was told it couldn't foreclose on a New Jersey home mortgage because it hadn't filed a business activity report. The state's Supreme Court subsequently ruled that the Florida company could renew its access to the state courts by filing the required report and paying any overdue taxes and penalties. The state has appealed that ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.    Dale Busacker, senior tax manager in the Minneapolis office of the Ernst andamp; Whinney accounting firm, says states will be watching closely to see how the Supreme Court rules. &quot;If the court reverses (the New Jersey Supreme Court), I'd look for every state in the country to enact something like this,&quot; he says.    Denver Pollution Panel   Urges Fireplace Ban   THE WOOD-BURNING fireplace, symbol of everything warm and cozy, is under challenge in Denver. Air-quality officials say the fireplace is a major contributor to Denver's infamous &quot;brown cloud,&quot; a noxious blanket of pollution that settles over the city in the winter.    Last week, Denver's Metropolitan Air Quality Council voted overwhelmingly to recommend that local governments in the area ban construction of open wood-burning fireplaces in new and existing homes. A proposal requiring that existing fireplaces be converted to natural gas or put out of commission when property is sold passed narrowly. The council also is recommending that the state grant tax credits for the fireplace conversions.    The fireplace industry is burned up. The Wood Heating Alliance, a Washington-based trade group, says it would cost as much as $400 million to convert Denver's 270,000 fireplaces.    But Steven Howards, the air quality council's executive director, says fireplaces may be to blame for as much as 25% of Denver's cold-weather air pollution, much of it tiny particulate matter considered especially hazardous to health. He says the housing industry already is shifting gears, installing gas fireplaces in about a third of the area's new homes.    Local governments in the metropolitan area will have the final say on the ban. But several of the council's past proposals -- such as mandatory wood-burning bans on high-pollution days -- are now part of life in Denver.    Shortage in Job Skills   Is Seen for California   CALIFORNIA FACES a potential mismatch between the skills of its population and the job requirements of its high-tech economy.    Hispanics and Asians will account for three-fourths of the increase in California's labor force between now and 1995. But Hispanics and Asians, plus blacks, aren't holding higher skilled jobs in proportion to their population numbers. Workers on the low end of the job scale must move up if the state is to support sophisticated industry, says the Palo Alto-based Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy.    &quot;Unless the occupational profile of California's minority groups begins to change dramatically,&quot; the center says, &quot;the state's future labor force may not possess the needed skills and training to staff the jobs produced by an increasingly technological economy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
