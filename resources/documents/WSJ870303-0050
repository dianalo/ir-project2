SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM LABOR WNEWSAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp., which just a year ago scrapped cost-of-living allowances for salaried employees and switched to raises based on merit alone, now is making its 1987 merit-pay formula far less lucrative.    The No. 1 auto maker will give merit raises in the form of lump-sum payments, rather than rolling them into employees' base pay as has been done in the past. That means next year's base salaries will be the same as this year's, which is in effect a salary freeze. The change would preclude increases in pensions and various benefits that are determined as a percentage of base salaries. Approximately 109,000 white-collar workers in the U.S. and Canada are affected.    Besides changing the form of merit raises, the company also is reducing the size of the merit-pay pool to 3.5% of the salary payroll from 5.5% last year.    A GM spokesman confirmed the changes, saying they &quot;are being made so we can be competitive&quot; in costs. He said employees are being notified this week. He said that GM also had made &quot;technical&quot; changes in its overtime policy for salaried workers, but that he didn't know whether this would reduce overtime payments. One employee, however, said his supervisor told his group that employees would have to work longer hours to qualify for overtime payments, and that they would no longer receive time-and-a-half for that overtime.    The changes are likely to further damage morale in the company's middle-management ranks. For years, GM was noted for treating its white-collar employees well in terms of pay and benefits, but recently morale has been battered by GM's poor financial results and market performance, by the expensive buyout of dissident director H. Ross Perot, and by the company's sweeping cost-cutting campaign. GM is in the process of slashing its white-collar work force 25%, and many employees fear for their jobs.    What is more, there is already wide resentment within GM over the bonuses being paid to about 5,000 executives and top managers for last year. Other salaried and hourly workers aren't getting profit-sharing payments because of GM's lackluster 1986 performance. GM notes that executives put a high proportion of their total compensation at risk under the bonus plan, and that the bonuses are less than those paid a year ago. But those explanations haven't satisfied many at the company, and the merit-pay news won't ease the situation.    &quot;This takes morale and throws it right out the window,&quot; said a 20-year GM veteran, who noted that his supervisor notified his group of the changes yesterday afternoon. &quot;It affects everything. It affects your life insurance for your spouse, it affects your stock savings, your retirement . . . . But (GM Chairman) Roger Smith is still going to get his million bucks.&quot;    A year ago, when GM last changed the pay system for salaried employees, it essentially took the money earmarked for cost-of-living allowances and put it in the merit-pay pool. But by reducing the size of the merit-pay pool to 3.5% of the payroll from 5.5%, GM is in effect keeping the cost-of-living money instead of distributing it in the merit pool.    Before last year, salaried employees were eligible for both an inflation adjustment and a merit raise. GM's hourly workers still receive cost-of-living adjustments, and the company said Friday they would get a cost-of-living-adjustment pay increase of five cents an hour for the current quarter.    By paying the merit raise as a lump sum, GM would be applying to salaried workers the changes it negotiated with hourly workers in 1984. In that contract, the United Auto Workers accepted lump-sum payments in place of a guaranteed annual raise incorporated in the base wage.    Concern about the merit-pay raises has been mounting among GM white-collar workers in recent weeks. While the timing and size of merit raises for the salaried workers can vary depending on job ratings, employees generally get the increase once a year, at the same time every year. For example, a high-performing employee who started working at GM in January could expect a merit raise every January.    But when no GM employees received merit payments in January and February, rumors about impending changes began to spread. Several salaried employees said this was the first time they could remember that the merit-pay plan wasn't in place at the beginning of the year. &quot;In previous years, they would make that determination in December,&quot; said Richard Shattuck, bargaining chairman of UAW Local 1869, which represents about 100 salaried workers at GM's Technical Center in suburban Detroit.    &quot;I've been at the design staff for 20 years,&quot; said Mr. Shattuck, &quot;and this is the first time we've known a delay like this.&quot;    The GM spokesman said the lump-sum payments would begin April 1.    The change in GM's merit pay could generate more interest among salaried workers in affiliating with the UAW. But the union already has made a concerted effort to organize GM's white-collar workers during the past few years, a time of tumult in the auto industry, with little success.    Separately, GM said William P. MacKinnon, 48 years old, resigned as vice president in charge of the personnel administration and development staff, to pursue &quot;other career opportunities.&quot;    GM said he will remain a GM vice president for a limited period to &quot;assist in an orderly transition and to handle certain other assignments.&quot; A GM spokesman said his successor hasn't been selected.    Mr. MacKinnon wasn't available for comment, GM said. </TEXT></DOC>
