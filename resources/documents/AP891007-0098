In a weekend session called to tackle pressing budgetarymatters, the Senate sent President Bush a spending bill containingthe art limitations on a 91-6 vote. Bush is expected to sign themeasure.   The House four days ago voted 381-41 to adopt the same spendingmeasure, a compromise fashioned by a House-Senate conferencecommittee.   The funding prohibition _ which constitutional lawyers sayappears to be the first restriction on federal art assistance basedon content _ also was a compromise. Conservatives wanted a stricterban, while liberals argued that any limits would inhibit artists.   The bill forbids the National Endowment for the Arts and theNational Endowment for the Humanities to finance works thatendowment officials believe ``may be considered obscene.'' Itspecifically precludes subsidies for art depicting sadomasochism,homoeroticism, child exploitation or sex acts between people.   To deny the money, however, those officials would also have toconclude that a work lacked serious literary, artistic, politicalor scientific value.   Final passage came as Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., lost alast-ditch fight to toughen the restrictions. The Senate rejected,62-35, his proposal to add prohibitions against federal aid for artthat depicts, ``in a patently offensive way, sexual or excretoryactivities or organs.'' They then adopted the art restrictions inthe bill on a voice vote.   Helms argued that the government should not subsidize art thatmany people find offensive, and that his proposal _ using languagefrom a Supreme Court decision _ would prevent that.   ``No artist, no citizen has a right to intrude into taxpayers'pockets,'' Helms said.   Critics of the Helms restrictions said they would amount tocensorship and noted that only about 20 of 85,000 federal artsgrants have caused major controversy over the years.   ``In a free society, we must not yield to the appeals of theknow-nothings,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``We must notembrace the calls for censorship.''   When the fight began last summer, Helms had sought to bangovernment assistance for obscene or indecent art, includingportrayals of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, child exploitation andsexual acts between people. He also wanted to bar federal grantsfor works that belittle any religion, race, ethnic group, age groupor handicap.   Current federal law permits the National Endowment for the Artsto finance projects that ``in the experts' view foster excellence,are reflective of exceptional talent, and have significantliterary, scholarly, cultural or artistic merit.''   Conservative crticism earlier this year of two federally backedarts exhibits sparked action in Congress. The endowment spent$15,000 for a show that featured an Andres Serrano photograph of acrucifix in urine, and $30,000 to display photographs by the lateRobert Mapplethorpe that pictured children in suggestive poses andhomosexual acts.   House liberals thwarted a conservative effort last summer toeliminate or severely slash the endowment's $170 million budgetbecause of the exhibitions, settling for a symbolic $45,000 cut inthe agency's financing for this year.   The Senate, however, adopted Helms' original provision on a July26 voice vote, toning it down in another vote Sept. 29.   Many lawmakers complained that the controversy left them in apolitically ticklish position: vote for the restrictions or be leftvulnerable to election-year charges of supporting federallyfinanced pornography. With conservatives aggressively pursuingstrong restrictions, liberals were pressured into acceptinglimitations in some form.   The restrictions are to last one year. A commission establishedby the legislation will study the endowments' decision-making inawarding grants and whether standards for qualifying works areneeded.   The endowment is also ordered to give Congress a 30-day warningif funds will be granted to the Southeastern Center forContemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., which showed the Serranopicture, and the Institute for Contemporary Art at the Universityof Pennsylvania, which exhibited the Mapplethorpe photographs.   The $11.2 billion measure for the Interior Department, culturaland other programs is for fiscal 1990, which began Sunday.   The legislation also extends for another year a ban on theleasing of offshore tracts for oil and gas drilling; imposes newrestrictions on lobbyists who seek federal money for clients; andallows lumber companies to cut timber on federally owned land inthe Northwest while protecting areas inhabited by the rare spottedowl.
