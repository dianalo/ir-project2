Manuel A. Noriega, a newspaper reportedtoday.   The covert operation has ``no restrictions'' other than an orderprohibiting Noriega's assassination and could involve U.S. troops,the Los Angeles Times reported, citing unidentified sources.   ``It is an unimpeded effort to try to topple Noriega,'' onesource told the Times. ``We're going into it with the understandingthat there may be loss of life, though the effort will be not tokill anyone.''   President Bush said at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., beforeleaving for Houston today that he would neither confirm nor denythe report.   ``If there was a covert operation, would I discuss it, ever? Itwouldn't be covert if I even referred to it, so there will be nosuch discussion of anything, which means I am not confirming nordenying,'' he told reporters on Air Force One.   Vice President Dan Quayle also declined to comment directly onthe report today. But when asked if it was proper for the UnitedStates to try to get involved in an effort to oust Noriega, hereplied:   ``It's certainly proper for the United States to state thepolicy very clearly, and that policy is that the sooner Noriegaleaves power, the better off the people of Panama are going to be,the better off the people of Central America are going to be. ...''   Asked if the administration and Congress were still coordinatedon the effort to get Noriega out, Quayle said: ``The policy onPanama and other issues are very closely coordinated with theCongress. This president insists on consultation and he has goneout of his way to consult with Congress on this and other matters.''   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since he wasindicted on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988 by federalgrand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla.   ``What it boils down to is that we want him alive in the UnitedStates or dead,'' one source told the Times.   Sources told the newspaper the CIA believes disgruntled officerswithin the Panama Defense Forces are willing to collaborate in theoverthrow.   The operation has been dubbed Panama-5 _ a referrence to pastactions against Noriega _ and reflects a renewed commitment by theBush administration, which drew criticism following the failed Oct.3 coup attempt by dissident Panamanian military officers.   Administration officials presented the plans for the operationto Senate and House intelligence committees three weeks ago, theTimes said.   During the failed October coup, the Bush administration said itshands were tied by a 13-year-old executive order banning U.S.involvement in the assassination of foreign figures.   Last month, the Justice Department was assigned to make clear aseries of Ford administration executive orders regardingclandestine action, the Times reported.   A clarification memo was written by William P. Barr, assistantattorney general in charge of legal counsel, sent to CIA DirectorWilliam H. Webster and finally delivered to the House and SenateIntelligence committees, the newspaper said.   According to the Times, the memo paves the way for more activeU.S. involvement in coup attempts not meant to result inassassination but that could result in death.</TEXT></DOC>
