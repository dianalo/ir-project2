Members of a committee formed by the academy's Institute ofMedicine declined at a news conference to put the blame on anyparticular administration or segment of the health community.   ``I think this is something that has evolved over time,'' saidBailus Walker Jr., professor of environmental health and toxicologyat State University of New York in Albany and president of theAmerican Public Health Association.
