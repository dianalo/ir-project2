Hundreds of people were reporteddead in a ruthless crackdown on dissent.   The crackdown kept demonstrators off the streets for a secondday today. Pro-democracy activists were reported going underground.   Government spokesman Kyaw San said troops killed 67 people,wounded 34 and arrested 100 ``in the course of the government's lawand order restoration work'' in Rangoon and three other areasTuesday and today.   That brought the official death toll to at least 144 peoplekilled since Saw Maung seized power Sunday to quell a countrywideuprising against 26 years of authoritarian rule.   But independent accounts say more than 200 people have beenkilled. And some Western diplomats in Rangoon put the number deadat up to 400.   ``At Rangoon General Hospital, there were 200 corpses on Mondaynight and that was only one hospital,'' said one diplomat, whoestimated there had been as many as 400 deaths in all.   He said trucks loaded with bodies were seen after the height ofthe shooting earlier in the week.   In the heart of Rangoon today, troops conducted house-to-housesearches following a rocket attack against two key governmentbuildings.   Gunfire was heard throughout the night but there were noprotests _ almost daily occurrences in Rangoon in recent weeks _ assoldiers patrolled the city.   ``They seem to have subdued the protesters pretty much,'' said aBangkok-based diplomat. ``It's a peasant army ... Their attitude isthat they have to follow orders. They trust their officers.''   The diplomat said students, who have spearheaded the uprising,were going underground and might resort to guerrilla tacticsagainst the 186,000-member military.   One opposition leader, a student, said street protests had beencalled off to avoid bloodshed. He and the diplomats spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Open confronation between the army and protesters would be like``a peashooter against a tank,'' another diplomat in Bangkok said.   The authorities have been ``incredibly ruthless when you lookover the past month. It's breathtakingly, breathtakingly callousbehavior,'' the diplomat said.   State-run Radio Rangoon said Saw Maung was chosen prime ministerby the nine-member government, or State Law and Order RestorationCouncil, which he named on Tuesday. He also holds the posts ofdefense and foreign minister.   Only Minister of Health Pe Thein was a civilian, and at leastsix ministers were among the 18 senior officers who mountedSunday's coup with Saw Maung. The broadcast also said localmilitary leaders will serve as top government officials in theirareas.   Saw Maung is considered a right-hand man of toppled presidentSein Lwin, who was widely blamed for earlier suppression of dissent.   Bloody rioting forced an end to Sein Lwin's presidency, whichlasted 16 days until Aug. 12. He had replaced Ne Win, who ruledBurma since a 1962 military coup but stepped down in July.   Ne Win is widely believed to be the power behind Burma'sgovernment.   Saw Maung said he mounted his coup, unseating civilian PresidentMaung Maung, to halt the country's social chaos and ensuredemocratic elections.   Maung Maung, Burma's first civilian leader in 26 years, hadgiven in to opposition demands to hold elections and to theestablishment of a multiparty system.   A sticking point was the opposition's demand for an an interimgovernment before the elections.   Today, the government spokesman cited more than a dozenincidents in Rangoon involving bloody confrontations betweenlooters and troops. A Japanese Embassy official quoted a Rangoontelevision report saying citizens had attacked at least threepolice stations in the city and taken away more than 10 guns.   Similar incidents were also reportedly occuring in other areasof Burma, the official said.   Radio Rangoon reported five separate incidents Tuesday in whichsecurity forces killed 59 people, including looters, and injuredseveral others.   In one case, troops killed 14 people when civilians assaulted amilitary truck in an eastern section of Rangoon, the radio said.   Troops on Monday killed at least 100 people protesting the coup.   Senior opposition leaders issued a statement Tuesday appealingfor talks with Saw Maung to resolve the country's deepening crisisand criticizing the military's crackdown on dissent.   Burma has been in turmoil since students rioted last Septemberagainst isolationist government policies that have crippled theeconomy.</TEXT></DOC>
