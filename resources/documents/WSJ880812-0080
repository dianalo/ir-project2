With time running out for legislative action in the election season, the bill's chances of becoming law are cloudy. The measure hasn't yet come up in the Senate and faces an almost certain veto by President Reagan. But as elections approach, the vote symbolically highlights the difference between the parties on the issue, with Democrats voting overwhelmingly for the bill and Republicans overwhelmingly against.    The legislation, passed by a vote of 244-132, would end all U.S. investment in South Africa, requiring corporations and individuals to divest their holdings. Imports from South Africa would be banned, except for certain minerals, publications, and goods from black-owned companies. Most non-agricultural exports to South Africa would be barred also. The measure is far more stringent than the sanctions passed over Mr. Reagan's veto in 1986, which ended new investment and selected imports.    Supporters argued that stiffer sanctions are needed because the South African regime has consolidated power and hasn't made significant reforms since the 1986 sanctions took effect. Opponents asserted the legislation would hurt black South Africans by slowing the economy and forcing out U.S. corporations that have offered better pay and working conditions to blacks than South African corporations.    The measure moved to the House floor yesterday after the White House sent two high-ranking officials to Capitol Hill to urge House members to put off the vote until September, after Congress recesses for the Republican convention and its late-summer vacation.    National Security Adviser Colin Powell and Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Chester Crocker met with House supporters of the bill and said it was complicating their negotiations for getting South Africa to end its illegal occupation of neighboring Namibia. In exchange, Cuba would agree to withdraw about 50,000 troops from Angola, north of Namibia.    Rep. Ronald Dellums (D., Calif.), the sponsor of the bill and a longtime supporter of sanctions, said he offered to put off the vote if Mr. Reagan would allow the bill to become law. But he said Mr. Powell and Mr. Crocker balked at such a promise.    Other supporters were angry at the White House moves, suggesting they were motivated less by the Angola-South Africa negotiations than by a desire to avoid highlighting Republican opposition to further sanctions just before the Republican convention next week.    &quot;When it comes to black Americans and black Africans, {the administration doesn't} want to give them their basic rights,&quot; said Rep. Tony Coelho (D., Calif.).    The bill now moves to the Senate. Aides to the Senate leadership said they probably won't have time to bring up the legislation before Congress ends its session in early October, but added that House passage increases political pressure to consider it. Even if it does pass, the bill currently doesn't have the Republican support needed to override a veto.    The measure also includes provisions banning most cooperation between U.S. and South African intelligence agencies, and prohibiting energy companies from doing business with the country. In addition, the president would be required to push other allies to impose sanctions. The 1986 act only encouraged the president to take such action. </TEXT></DOC>
