Boesky, the one-time stock baron at thecenter of Wall Street's fraud scandals, is pumping iron and growinga beard at a California prison, a published report says.   Boesky also is deeply tanned and jogs daily on the outdoor trackat the minimum-security federal prison camp in Lompoc, Calif.,Manhattan inc. magazine reports in its July issue.   The 52-year-old former speculator in April completed one year ofa three-year sentence for pleading guilty of conspiracy to lie tothe Securities and Exchange Commission in connection withallegations of insider trading.   Boesky paid the SEC $100 million in alleged ill-gotten profitsand penalties in late 1986 to settle charges he used illegal insideinformation to profit on securities deals.   He was eligible for parole in March, but declined to apply. Afederal judge recently rejected his appeal for a reduced sentence,and his earliest possible release date based on good behavior isApril 4, 1990.   Quoting unidentified visitors to Boesky, Manhattan inc. said theconvicted arbitrager whose confessions have spawned several otherWall Street fraud prosecutions has grown a full white beard and is``impressively muscled.''   ``Boesky works out every day at the outdoor weight area Lompocprovides inmates, and he has built himself up substantially,'' themagazine said. ``He jogs daily on Lompoc's makeshift track.''   The magazine said that Boesky's bodybuilding ``is probably inpart to insure that he is able to defend himself'' because he fearedfor his safety when he entered the prison 15 months ago.</TEXT></DOC>
