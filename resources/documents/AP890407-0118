No casualties werereported.   Pakistan did not immediately respond. This country gives refugeto more than 3 million Afghan war refugees and Moslem guerrillasfighting to overthrow President Najib's communist government.   The attack came after the guerrillas' government-in-exileordered more intense fighting in response to Najib's announcementof a unilateral cease-fire to mark Islam's holiest month ofRamadan, which began Thursday.   Moscow added the missiles with their range of 100-175 miles tothe Afghan arsenal last November. They were paraded through Kabulat the time, and Pakistan warned they were capable of hittinghitting Pakistani territory.   Government troops have been firing Scud missiles at Jalalabad,where their fellow soldiers are engaged in an intense battle forthe city with Moslem guerrillas. Kabul is 120 miles west of thePakistan border.   In the Afghan capital Thursday, state radio said nine civiliansand one soldier have been killed during the past 24 hours in abarrage of rebel rocket fire on Jalalabad, 45 miles west of thePakistan border.   The rebels' Afghan News Agency said in a statement that 80Afghan soldiers were killed in fighting around Jalalbad in the pastthree days.   Kabul Radio also blamed rebels for the deaths of three peoplewhom it said were killed when rockets hit the eastern garrison townof Khost, several miles from the Pakistan border. The radio reportsaid government troops killed 148 guerrillas in retaliatoryfighting.   It is impossible to verify either sides' claims.
