It consisted of three parts: Part I, PrecautionaryArea; Part II, Eastern Approach; and Part III, Southern Approach. As required by the 1978 amendments to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act(PWSA), 33 U.S.C. 1223(c), the Coast Guard initiated a port access routestudy on April 16, 1979 (44 FR 22543) to evaluate potential traffic density,traffic patterns, waterway use conflicts, and the need for safe accessroutes in the Chesapeake Bay Entrance area. The Notice of Study Resultswas published on July 22, 1982, at 47 FR 31766. That study concluded thatthe existing TSS in the approaches to the Chesapeake Bay was adequate forthe foreseeable future. The completion of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) dredging projectin the Thimble Shoal Channel necessitated suspension of the Southern Approachlanes of the TSS. After dredging, the Thimble Shoal Channel accommodatesvessels with drafts exceeding the water depths in the Southern Approachlanes. On June 3, 1988, the Coast Guard notified IMO that the SouthernApproach lanes would be suspended effective October 15, 1988, and thata Port Access Route Study would be opened. Mariners were notified of thissuspension in Local Notice to Mariners No. 29/88 dated July 19, 1988, andby Notice to Mariners No. 31 dated July 30, 1988. A system of safe waterbuoys now directs vessels to naturally occurring deeper water in the vicinityuntil an amended traffic separation scheme is implemented. A Port Access Route Study was opened on July 12, 1988 (53 FR 26282). Conductedby the Fifth Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, VA, the study was openedto evaluate the need for vessel routing measures in the approaches to ChesapeakeBay. The area studied encompassed the approaches to the Chesapeake Bay,including the TSS. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Study </ITAG>The study, performed in accordance with the PWSA (33 U.S.C. 1223(c)(3),involved contacts with other Federal agencies, state government officials,and representatives of a wide variety of interests in the area. Interestedparties were asked to submit their comments by October 11, 1988. Commentswere also solicited through the Local Notice to Mariners. In addition,comments were specifically solicited from 165 companies/marine interests.<ITAG tagnum="84">Uses of the Area </ITAG>The entrance to Chesapeake Bay controls access to two of the largest U.S.ports, Hampton Roads and Baltimore. The ports handle all types of commoditiesin break bulk, container, bulk liquid and solid form. Hampton Roads isthe only port in the nation which permits the importation of spent nuclearfuel rods for reprocessing. Both ports are coal export centers and in 1984,69% of the U.S. coal exports transited the Chesapeake Bay entrance. The waters in the study area are used for both commercial and governmentnavigation as well as military exercises and training activities. The NavyFiring Range at Dam Neck conducts beginning and advanced training on varioussized large bore rifled guns. U.S. Army anti-aircraft training is alsoconducted within the study area. The largest naval base in the world, U.S.Naval Base, Norfolk, is in this area. Additionally, recreational and commercialfishing is extensive because of the proximity of the Gulf Stream.<ITAG tagnum="84">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) Dredging Projects </ITAG>Over the last decade, coal has been carried in larger vessels that requiredeeper water to navigate safely. These deep-draft vessels (drafts over45andmin16;) may be restricted in their ability to maneuver and may requiremore sea area to navigate safely. In order to stay competitive with othercoal exporting countries, the U.S. has undertaken several dredging andchannel improvement projects in the Chesapeake Bay and Hampton Roads areato accommodate larger colliers. Between Cape Henry and Baltimore, eight channels (Cape Henry, York Spit,Rappahannock Shoal, Craighill, Brewerton, Craighill Entrance, Fort McHenryand Curtis Bay) will be deepened to 50 feet below mean low water. Thisproject is scheduled to be complete in 1990. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-662 dated November17, 1986, authorized the deepening of the Thimble Shoal, Newport News,Craney Island Reach, Norfolk Harbor Reach and the Entrance Reach Channelsto a depth of 55 feet below mean low water. Thimble Shoal Channel providesthe only means of entrance and departure for deep-draft vessels callingon Hampton Roads and ports along the James River. Thimble Shoal Channelwill connect deep water at the entrance to Hampton Roads with deep waterat the entrance to Chesapeake Bay. Phase I (deepening of the outbound laneof the Thimble Shoal, Newport News and Norfolk Harbor Reach Channels to50 feet) was completed on October 15, 1988. The COE also plans to dredge an ``Atlantic Ocean Channel'' connecting deepwater at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay with deep water in the AtlanticOcean. As currently planned, the Atlantic Ocean Channel, in the vicinityof the Southern Approach lanes, will be completed in 1992. The 1300andmin16;wide channel will be constructed in two phases: Phase I will dredge a 650andmin16;wide, 60+andmin16; deep outbound lane; and Phase II will dredge a 650andmin16;wide, 60+andmin16; deep inbound lane. <ITAG tagnum="84">Study Data </ITAG>Vessel traffic density data for the study area was obtained from the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers <T3>Waterborne Commerce of the United States </T3>for the Baltimore andNorfolk Districts, and from the Maryland Port Administration, VirginiaPilot Association, U.S. Navy and the Hampton Roads Maritime Association.The study also considered historical data obtained from the National WeatherService on weather conditions, including wind and tidal information, waveclimate of the Atlantic Ocean Channel and vicinity, and seasonal conditions.The Coast Guard also reviewed environmental studies of the area conductedby the COE. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments </ITAG>Seven letters acknowledged receipt of the study notice but had no comments.Six letters were received with comments or suggestions pertaining to thetemporary buoy system, the proposed Atlantic Ocean Channel, and the SouthernApproach lanes. The following issues were addressed in the comments: Two commenters recommended retaining the Eastern Approach to the TSS. Two commenters discussed use of the Atlantic Ocean Channel when Phase I(dredging of the outbound lane to 60+andmin16;) is completed. Two commenters felt there was a continuing need for a southern approach.Two commenters addressed the proximity of the Dam Neck Firing Zone to theSouthern Approach lanes. Commander, Naval Base Norfolk, stated that hewill work with the COE to relocate the boundary of the firing range. One commenter recommended installation of a RACON on the first inboundeastern and southern approach TSS buoys. <ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Conclusions </ITAG>1. The number and size of vessels calling on Chesapeake Bay ports is expectedto increase as the dredging and port improvement projects are completed.2. There is a need for a deep-water route for vessels with drafts greaterthan 45andmin16;. 3. There is a continuing need for the Southern Approach vessel trafficlanes, but the present configuration is not adequate. 4. There is a continuing need for the Precautionary Area and Eastern Approachparts of the TSS and the present configuration is adequate. 5. A system of safe water buoys directing vessels to naturally occurringdeeper waters will meet the needs of vessels normally using the SouthernApproach lanes until a new configuration is implemented. <ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation </ITAG>The Study recommended that the Coast Guard widen and lengthen the SouthernApproach of the TSS to incorporate the proposed 1300andmin16; wide AtlanticOcean Channel as a deep-water route. It is anticipated that the Coast Guardwill initiate rulemaking and seek IMO approval to reconfigure the SouthernApproach as recommended.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 7, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">R.T.
