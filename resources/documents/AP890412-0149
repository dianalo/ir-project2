ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet-born conductor Mstislav Rostropovich,tearfully hailing a new era of artistic freedom in his homeland,announced Wednesday he will return to the Soviet Union for aconcert tour with the National Symphony Orchestra next February.   It will be his first visit to the Soviet Union _ except for abrief, unnoticed stopover in the Moscow airport a few years ago _since he fled into exile with his wife, soprano GalinaVishnevskaya, in 1974. They were stripped of their Sovietcitizenship four years later.   Rostropovich, 62, a world-renowned cellist who has been musicdirector of the National Symphony since 1977, told reporters at theKennedy Center he was ``very excited and very nervous'' aboutvisiting the homeland where he formerly was reviled and harassed bySoviet authorities.   He and Soviet ambassador Yuri Dubinin, tears streaming downtheir faces, embraced after the news conference. Dubinin hintedbroadly that if Rostropovich gave a signal, the Kremlin would bewilling to initiate the process of restoring his Soviet citizenship.   But Rostropovich carefully avoided giving any indication of hisfuture intentions, choosing instead to lavish praise on SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform policies.   ``The Soviet people have so much more freedom, so much moreglasnost, than before Mr. Gorbachev,'' he said. ``For artisticfreedom, there has been enormous change.''   Rostropovich acknowledged that he had once vowed never to returnto his homeland until there were major changes in the Sovietsystem. But he said Wednesday that Gorbachev's far-reaching reforms``give me the moral right to go there.''   After the National Symphony completes a two-week tour of Japanin late January and early February, Rostropovich and the 103-memberorchestra will fly to the Soviet Union for two concerts in Moscowand two in Leningrad in about a week.   Although the concert programs for the Soviet tour wereundecided, Rostropovich said his first choices were AntoninDvorak's double concerto for cello and orchestra, with himself atthe cello, and Dmitri Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, a powerfulmusical denunciation of the political and human rights abuses ofthe Stalin era.   It was unclear Wednesday whether Rostropovich's wife would jointhe Soviet tour.   Dubinin said the tour will be ``a very, very important page forhis biography, for development of cultural exchanges ... and fordeep changes in our society and our relations with the UnitedStates.''   The ambassador said the issue of restoring Rostropovich'scitizenship was ``a special question'' which ``depends now on thewill of Maestro Rostropovich whether to begin the procedure.''   Dubinin added: ``Let's hope the time will come when all the(legal) decisions will be taken according to the wishes of MaestroRostropovich.''   Stephen Klein, the orchestra's executive director, said it wasonly on Monday that he received the formal invitation fromGosconcert, the Soviet performing arts agency, for the NationalSymphony to make the tour.   Although such a trip had been rumored for months, the orchestraplayers were not given the official news until Rostropovich mountedthe podium in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall for their regularWednesday morning rehearsal.   Klein said he considered it highly unlikely that Rostropovichwould seek to regain his Soviet citizenship and to return homepermanently, leaving his lucrative job at the National Symphony,his concert recitals and recording commitments.   In an emotional speech to orchestra members, Klein said,Rostropovich noted that many of his Soviet contemporaries _including Shostakovich, pianist Emil Gilels and violinist DavidOistrakh _ had died. He told his musicians that ``you have becomemy family.''   Rostropovich's troubles with Soviet authorities began when andhis wife took Soviet author Alexander Solzhenitsyn into their homeafter the 1970 Nobel Prize winner was kicked out of the Sovietwriters' union and deprived of his apartment.   The couple's concerts and foreign tours were canceled, allrecording sessions were halted and they suffered a total blackoutin the Soviet press. After Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,intervened with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, the couple obtainedexit visas, fled to the West in 1974 and decided to stay.   Rostropovich's rehabilitation began in 1987 when Sovietauthorities allowed his sister, Veronika, to fly to Washington toattend festivities marking the conductor's 60th birthday.   In January, the government newspaper Izvestia urged restorationof the couple's citizenship, and a senior member of the Sovietforeign ministry said in February that authorities would review thecases of people stripped of their citizenship. Last month, afavorable documentary on Rostropovich and his wife was broadcast onSoviet television.</TEXT></DOC>
