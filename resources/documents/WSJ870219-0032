District court Judge Claude Hilton dismissed civil claims filed by the government last July against all five men and Boeing, which also was named as a defendant in the suit.    The Justice Department alleged that the payments, which totaled $485,000 and were made in 1981 and 1982, &quot;created a conflict of interest situation&quot; and shouldn't have been billed to the government as part of the normal practice of passing on business costs. The government, however, didn't allege that the former Boeing executives did anything to benefit the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer or its military contracts.    In his ruling, Judge Hilton said the payments weren't intended to supplement the government salaries of Melvyn Paisley, assistant Navy secretary for research, engineering and systems, or the other former executives. The judge also ruled that Boeing &quot;repeatedly disclosed&quot; making severance payments to former executives, as well as the fact that some of the payments were calculated on anticipated financial losses by individuals in the future.    The government's suit alleged that in some cases, Boeing calculated the payments based on the employee's anticipated &quot;assignment&quot; or the length of his &quot;tour&quot; with the Defense Department.    In his ruling, however, the judge concluded that severance payments were standard practice for Boeing officials who left the company for public service. He also said that some of the defendants' superiors in the government were aware of and approved the practice, and that the payments &quot;created neither the appearance of nor an actual conflict of interest,&quot; because none of the individuals was &quot;in a position in the government to provide preferential treatment to Boeing.&quot;    A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said the decision was under review and department officials hadn't decided whether to appeal.    The suit accused Mr. Paisley of improperly receiving $183,000 when he retired from Boeing in October 1981.    The other individuals named in the suit were Lawrence H. Crandon, identified in the suit as an official of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Air Command and Control System; Thomas K. Jones, a former deputy undersecretary of defense for strategic and nuclear forces; Herbert A. Reynolds, former deputy director of space and intelligence policy in the office of the undersecretary of defense for policy; and Harold Kitson, a former Navy deputy assistant secretary for command, control, communications and intelligence.    A Justice Department official said that except for Messrs. Paisley and Crandon, the officials have left their government jobs.    &quot;The outcome of the trial has vindicated our position that there was no wrongdoing whatsoever involved in the severance payments to these five individuals and that they have carried out their government duties honorably and responsibly,&quot; a Boeing spokesman said.    In Washington, another Boeing spokesman said that Mr. Jones is the only defendant who has returned to work for the company, but the company didn't describe his new title. </TEXT></DOC>
