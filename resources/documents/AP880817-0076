Authorities said they provided the first automobile and the bulkof the 420,000 marks ($227,000) the robbers demanded to prevent anyharm to the two captive bank employees, and had planned to pursuethe getaway car.   Then, in a statement issued 24 hours after the robbery began,police in Gladbeck said they had ``lost contact with the gunmen andtheir victims.''   The statement said the bank robbers switched cars twice afterfleeing the scene with their hostages late Tuesday.   In the first, the gunmen rushed into a restaurant and demandedthe keys to a high-powered BMW, which they used as part of theescape. Details of the second car change were not included in thepolice statment, which added that the fugitives presumably had leftthe Gladeck area in central Germany.   The gunmen had burst into a bank early Tuesday in this town 50miles north of Cologne and held police at bay for 14 hours beforefleeing with $65,000 stolen from the bank and an additional$162,000 provided by authorities.   ``It doesn't matter whether we give them 300,000 marks or amillion. Our foremost concern is the hostages,'' police spokesmanKlaus Fechner said.   Fechner said the robbers had threatened to kill their hostages,a 34-year-old man who worked as a bank teller and a 23-year-oldwoman who worked as a customer service representative.   The gunmen fired warning shots through windows of the building,but no injuries were reported.   Negotiators had continued to try to persuade the two gunmen tosurrender, but they refused, demanding the getaway car theyeventually used at the start of the escape.   Police officials said they had intended to follow the Audi sedanand arrest the two men, but lost contact after the two car changes.</TEXT></DOC>
