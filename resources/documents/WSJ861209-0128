All Nippon is the first Japanese customer for the A320, which is expected to make its first flight next March and to enter service in 1988.    In Toulouse, France, Airbus said All Nippon chose the A320 to replace its 14 Boeing Co. 737s in use on domestic routes. Under terms of the transaction, the Japanese carrier will acquire 10 planes starting in September 1990, Airbus said. All Nippon intends to operate the planes in a 164-seat, all-economy layout.    In Tokyo, All Nippon said it hasn't yet chosen between CFM International S.A.'s CFM56-5A1 engine and International Aero Engines AG's competing V2500 model. CFM International is a joint venture between General Electric Co. of the U.S. and Snecma of France; International Aero Engines is a consortium comprising Rolls-Royce Ltd., United Technologies' Pratt andamp; Whitney Group unit, Japanese Aero Engines Corp., MTU Motoren andamp; Turbinen Union Muenchen G.m.b.H. and Fiat Aviazione S.p.A.    Excluding yesterday's agreement, Airbus said the A320 has attracted 236 firm orders and 133 options from 13 airlines and leasing companies. Airbus competed for the sale with Boeing, which was offering its new 737-400 planes, and with McDonnell Douglas's MD-88 twin-jet.    The European consortium's only other Japanese client is TOA Domestic Airlines, which operates 11 Airbus A300 wide-body aircraft.    Airbus is owned by Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    ---   Mitsui Orders Five MD-11s   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft Co. unit said it received an order for five MD-11 aircraft, with a total value of about $500 million, from Mitsui andamp; Co. Ltd. of Japan.    The order is subject to a decision by McDonnell Douglas to go ahead with production of the new airliner. As reported, the aerospace concern has said it must have orders for a total of 20 MD-11s from two airlines, one domestic, before launching the program. Last week, the company received an order for nine of the planes, valued at nearly $1 billion, from British Caledonian Airways.    However, McDonnell Douglas has said its board could change the criteria for going forward with the program. The board meets the last week of this month. The company said a decision is expected soon, but it wouldn't elaborate. The MD-11 is a successor to the DC-10.    Mitsui, the giant Japanese industrial and trading concern, markets McDonnell Douglas aircraft in Japan and other Asian nations and said it would lease the MD-11s to airlines there. </TEXT></DOC>
