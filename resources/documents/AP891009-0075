Delegates told reporters they chose Rezsoe Nyers as president ofthe Hungarian Socialist Party after key reformists reluctantlyshelved their reservations to avoid a possible split within theparty.   Nyers, who is considered a moderate, will lead the party duringthe campaign for the first free national elections in 41 years.   The selection was expected to exacerbate anxieties among somereformists who want a clean break from the past and who worry thatthe new party will not differ substantially from its predecessor.   Tension was reported following a decision by delegates Sunday tocontinue allowing party politics in the workplace. It has been acommon practice for communists to hold meetings and conductpolitical courses for employees in the workplace.   Reformers associate it with the indoctrination practices oftraditional Marxist-Leninist communist parties.   Along with Nyers, the top candidates to lead the new party werePremier Miklos Nemeth and Imre Pozsgay, both reformers. UnlikeNyers, they supported keeping politics separate from the workplace.   Nyers was chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, orCommunist Party, which was disbanded Saturday at the congress andreplaced by the Socialist Party. Founding documents describe thenew party as one with Euro-Communist and Socialist leanings,committed to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy.   In a vote today earlier taken by a show of hands, delegatesoverwhelmingly approved a manifesto calling for ``a constitutionalstate based on a multiparty system, where the source of power isthe will of the people expressed in free elections.''   The Socialist Party was described as ``an organization in theMarxist spirit ... totally committed to democracy.''      All members of the old party are automatically members of thenew one and can continue to remain so by stating their agreementwith its democratic principles.   The document creating the Socialist Party said it supports theconcept of private and state property and ``the development of a... multiparty parliamentary democracy.''   The move was the latest of a number of bold reforms in Hungary,which with Poland is in the forefront of democratic reform in theEast bloc.   But the initial euphoria of reformers seeking to create a partywith wide popular appeal was dampened when the congress endorsedkeeping politics in the workplace.   Of about 1,200 delegates present for Sunday's balloting just 107_ including Pozsgay, Nemeth and Foreign Minister Gyula Horn _ votedagainst the measure. There were 34 abstentions.   Free national elections are to be held by June, and theSocialist Party will remain in power at least until then.   But the new tensions could create a conflict between the partyand the government, which Nemeth leads.   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Nyers andNemeth ``aren't talking to each other.''   Even before the workplace vote, Deputy Premier Peter Medgyessyhad urged the new party to stop interfering in government businesspending the national elections.   In other developments Sunday:   _ A ranking Communist conservative, former Politburo memberJanos Berecz, defied Saturday's decision by the congress to createa new party. He said the old party should should continue to existuntil the rank and file decides on its fate.   Robert Ribanszki, another opponent of change, said he planned toorganize a plebiscite among the party's 720,000 members.   _ Officials at the congress said the hard-line Communist EastBerlin leadership _ embittered over Hungary's decision to allowEast Germans free passage to the West _ had expressed itscongratulations at the party's transformation.   Spokesman Emil Kimmel refused to elaborate, telling reportersthe text of the East German message would be published today, alongwith one from Romania, a Soviet bloc country that has previouslycondemned Hungarian reforms.   He also did not say whether the Soviets had sent congratulations.</TEXT></DOC>
