The interaction between the ions and {sup 4}He atomsis expressed in terms of the structure factor and quasiparticle operatorsof the quantum liquid. This model Hamiltonian is solved by a variationalscheme. On the basis of the nonparabolic energy-momentum spectum of thedressed ions, an explanation is given for the linear temperature dependenceof the ion effective mass observed in the experiments. The study revealssome interesting aspects of the interaction between classical particlesand quantum fields.</TEXT></DOC>
