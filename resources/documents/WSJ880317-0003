The uptrend accelerated as investors bought issues similar to the targets, in hopes that those issues, too, might attract an acquirer.    By the close, the Nasdaq industrials had climbed 2.96 points to 391.67, and the Nasdaq 100 index of the biggest OTC stocks was up 4.21 points, or more than 1%, to 360.84. The big-stock index had been off most of the day, but turned up after 3 p.m. Eastern time.    About 59.2 million Nasdaq shares traded at higher prices yesterday, and 36.3 million declined. Nasdaq volume of 141.8 million shares exceeded turnover of several recent slow days.    Western Auto Supply jumped 6 to 18 1/2 yesterday after Sears Roebuck said it agreed to buy 52.3% of its stock from officers and directors at $19 a share, with plans to buy the rest at the same price by March 22.    Investors' interest in stocks of other auto-parts retailers and distributors, many still foundering from October's price collapse, turned into near mania. In this vein, Crown Auto was offered $7 a share; the tiny OTC auto-parts concern had been selling around 6 1/4.    Yesterday, Trak Auto, a middle-size OTC parts company, jumped 2 1/2 to 13 1/2. Jiffy Lube International, which has been rising on takeover rumors for several weeks, rose 5/8 to 10 3/4.    Among other OTC auto supply and service concerns, Republic Auto Parts rose 7/8 to 7 1/2; Action Auto Stores was up 3/8 to 7 3/8.    Some trucking companies also were caught up in yesterday's search for takeover possibilities. That included American Carriers, which last month rejected a $15-a-share offer from one potential acquirer. Yesterday American Carriers, a small concern, rose 7/8 to 6 5/8 on 97,900 shares.    Among prices of some of Nasdaq's biggest truckers, Yellow Freight climbed 2 1/4 to 31 1/8, and Roadway Services rose 1 to 33.    The day's biggest gainer was Arthur D. Little, the market research and consulting concern, which rocketed 61%, or 20, to 53. The company announced that it is considering a management proposal that a new employee stock-ownership plan buy, at $57 a share, all of the common outstanding and not owned by Memorial Drive Trust, which owns about 70%. The issue is usually lightly traded, and yesterday only 7,700 shares changed hands.    Unibancorp, a Chicago-based bank holding company, climbed 6 1/2 to 28 after Old Kent Financial, a Grand Rapids, Mich., bank holding concern, agreed to acquire its stock for Old Kent shares it valued at about $32 each. Old Kent slipped 1/2 to 24 1/8.    While takeover attempts were boosting prices of many stocks, Henley Group jumped 1 3/4 to 25 5/8 because it plans to break apart some of its units. About 1.6 million shares of Henley changed hands on the news that its Wheelabrator unit would separate from the company and own Henley's investment in Wheelabrator Technologies and other refuse-to-energy assets. Wheelabrator, which also trades on Nasdaq, slipped 1/2 to 21 7/8 on the news.    But Wall Street's biggest excitement yesterday centered around Intel, the big OTC electronics concern, and whether International Business Machines intended to begin manufacturing a chip that Intel currently supplies.    Apparently a securities analyst told several Intel investors that IBM was making such a move. Throughout the day securities analysts argued the issue over news wires, in internal reports, and in discussions. In the afternoon, an Intel spokeswoman said the company has a contract to supply IBM through 1990 with &quot;substantial portions&quot; of the chips, known as 80386 microprocessors, and that while IBM holds the right to manufacture a portion of those chips, it isn't believed to be making any.    By the close, Intel dropped just 1/2 to 31. About five million shares traded, making it the day's most active issue. </TEXT></DOC>
