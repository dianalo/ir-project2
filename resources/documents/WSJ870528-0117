The cases come in anyway; you do what you can.    Here's how an official of the Communist Party neatly lays out the legal dimensions of a Yugoslav lawyer's work space:    &quot;We are for democracy,&quot; says Vladimir Stambuk, &quot;but not just for democracy's sake. Freedom of speech is one thing. Expressing political opinions against the existing system is another thing. The most democratic system cannot live in anarchy.&quot;    Mr. Stambuk, the executive secretary of the central committee of the Serbian Communist Party, sits at a desk in the party's skyscraper speaking rapidly in English while another man, who isn't introduced, takes down his every word.    &quot;What is really true,&quot; Mr. Stambuk says, &quot;is that very few things have been forbidden.&quot; Referring to a current case, he says: &quot;On this latest book, it is publishable except for three pages attacking Tito. In the U.S., you would not accept that a president should be thrown mud upon.&quot;    An American lawyer might argue that point. Nicola Barovic won't. He is counsel for the defense in the case against the book written by a dissident political scientist. Mr. Barovic well knows that the law in a Communist state protects the revolution first, the individual second. In every civil-rights case here, the best defense is obstinate optimism.    &quot;The district court banned the book,&quot; Mr. Barovic is saying. &quot;We appealed to the Supreme Court. It sent the case back to the district court. Now we're appealing a second time.&quot;    He has come in out of the Belgrade murk late one afternoon to sit in Slobodan Perovic's office and discuss tactics.    &quot;This man wrote that the Serbian nation in Yugoslavia is suppressed,&quot; Mr. Perovic says across a desk piled with papers. He is co-counsel for the defense. Both men are 36 years old; both chain-smoke.    &quot;So you defend two ways,&quot; says Mr. Barovic. &quot;You say it's true, and then you say it doesn't matter. It's private opinion.&quot;    Mr. Perovic rolls his chair back. Leather creaks. &quot;There have been many cases like this,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe 20 a year about books. Ten years ago, all these writers would have gone to prison.&quot;    &quot;That's a step ahead,&quot; Mr. Barovic says, optimistically.    In Communist countries, for the most part, defense lawyers who take political cases keep their heads down. Westerners who sit in on trials sometimes find it hard to tell the difference between the defense and the prosecution. But in Yugoslavia, law is a private enterprise, and the defense defends. Lately, a dozen or so men and women have gone so far as to proclaim civil rights their specialty.    &quot;I'm for free speaking,&quot; Mr. Barovic says. &quot;Speak anything you want. If it's nationalism or Nazism, no society is in danger from free speaking. A person has a right to say what he thinks.&quot;    That's what he thinks. Judges and prosecutors, of a different mind, have been known to give civil-rights lawyers trouble for saying what they think -- by accusing them of thinking what their clients say. Still, the state does send along lots of business.    This nation of diverse, cantankerous minority groups prosecutes Jehovah's Witnesses who don't want to join the army and Moslems who make nationalistic noises. It prosecutes Serbs who offend ethnic Albanians, Albanians who offend Serbs, and Montenegrins who offend both. It has prosecuted two Croats who gave interviews to foreign journalists, and two Bosnians who wore their beards Chetnik-style. (The Chetniks ran a resistance movement in World War II; they didn't get along with Tito.)    In this swirl of ethnic and regional rivalries, Yugoslavia opens 500 political cases a year, well ahead of its tamer East European neighbors. The state charges more than 90% of the people it arrests with &quot;verbal crimes.&quot; These range from singing disruptive songs to possession of dangerous poetry. The guilty face up to 10 years in prison under a 1959 &quot;hostile propaganda&quot; law brought in as a &quot;corrective influence on vacillating citizens.&quot;    Mr. Barovic, who once spent a few weeks at the University of Virginia reading up on McCarthyism, handled a memorable hostile propaganda case two years ago. He tells about it over a pepperoni and cheese pizza at a popular Belgrade restaurant.    &quot;The whole population was complaining about inflation and prices. The doctor did what everybody else was doing.&quot; Dr. Djrdje (pronounced Georgie) Vasic, the sole gynecologist in the Serbian town of Valjevo, complained in his bedroom to his girlfriend. &quot;She repeated it and, little by little, it got to the right ears.&quot; Dr. Vasic was nabbed.    He hired a lawyer, dropped him, then found Mr. Barovic. &quot;He was told I had no ties to the police. Clients like that.&quot; In court, the defense took two tacks. &quot;First, he wasn't an enemy, so he couldn't be hostile. Second, he had never said what they said he said.&quot;    Under questioning, seven of 11 witnesses disavowed affidavits the police had coaxed them to sign. Then, Mr. Barovic came upon a nice tidbit: the doctor's girlfriend had jilted him for a policeman. The whole case, suggested the defense, was a lovers' spat. The judge gulped, then reduced the charge to &quot;spreading false rumors.&quot; Dr. Vasic drew a six-month suspended sentence.    &quot;When you're a lawyer,&quot; Mr. Barovic says, &quot;you do anything to save your client from prison.&quot;    But in countries like this, a lawyer can't do anything much. The law says every defendant has the right to counsel and must be told of it. Many aren't. Even when told, a prisoner can't call a lawyer for three days after his arrest. All through the investigation, until the indictment appears, the lawyer can't see his client alone. If the crime is deemed a threat to state security, the lawyer can't get a look at the evidence until just before the trial begins.    The Yugoslav constitution spurns separation of powers. The judiciary is neither independent nor independent-minded; all but a few judges belong obediently to the Communist Party, which tends to trumpet a defendant's guilt as soon as the police arrest him.    Recently, a member who didn't think too highly of the party's performance sued it for back dues. The trial had to be postponed while the courts searched for a judge who wasn't blatantly biased. Lawyers in political cases have no such luck. They always ask the judges to disqualify themselves. The judges never do. They follow Tito's dictum on legality: poor judges, he once said, &quot;cling to the letter of the law like a drunkard to a fence.&quot;    Civil rights grow sparser in Yugoslavia as one moves south. The lawyers of Belgrade have only begun to venture into Kosovo, where Serbs and Albanians quarrel without rest. Tanja Petovar took her first case there last summer.    &quot;I got it in Stockholm,&quot; she says, working late in her office one night. &quot;A Kosovo emigre hired me to defend his father-in-law, a poor, illiterate man in prison because of his relative's political activity abroad. They charged him with hostile propaganda. You can apply it to anything.&quot;    Miss Petovar, who is 42 years old and took up law only five years ago, traveled to Kosovo with the same trepidation a New York lawyer might once have felt on the road to Alabama.    &quot;I didn't speak Albanian. I was in a city where I didn't know anybody. I was scared.&quot; The old man had already been indicted. She saw his file, then asked to see him -- alone. The police said no.    &quot;It was against the law. I protested to the president of the court. He gave us two hours. For the first time in years, a defense lawyer was able to speak freely with a client. The local lawyers I met told me that if they did what I did, they would be disbarred.&quot;    The court rewarded her client for this achievement with a five-year sentence. &quot;He was punished,&quot; Miss Petovar says, &quot;because he took a Belgrade lawyer.&quot;    The lawyer went home untouched -- protected, perhaps, by pedigree. Miss Petovar's father, now retired, was a general of the army and a vice minister of defense. Several of her colleagues have backgrounds equally imposing. Yet background didn't protect Srdja Popovic, a prominent lawyer who was charged with &quot;spreading false rumors&quot; at a political trial and was disbarred for a year. And Vladimir Seks had no pedigree to begin with.    &quot;They wanted to eliminate me as a defense lawyer,&quot; he says, resting his glasses on a pile of Vogue magazines in an anteroom at the home of Nicola Barovic. &quot;Eventually, they succeeded.&quot;    Mr. Seks, whose face is deeply lined at age 44, started out in Croatia as a public prosecutor. In 1972, he brought an unheard-of case against the security police for opening mail. The police forced him to resign, then charged him with hostile propaganda. He fought that case, while working as a defender, until 1985. Then he lost it, went to prison for seven months and was disbarred for 10 years.    &quot;I can't earn my bread and butter at the moment,&quot; he says.    But Mr. Seks's defeat coincided, not necessarily by coincidence, with his role in what has been the civil-rights lawyers' greatest source of hope. He joined Mr. Barovic, Miss Petovar and others in the 1984 defense of six Belgrade intellectuals against the most serious charge of counterrevolutionary activity.    Their sin was to meet in a tiny, book-filled Belgrade apartment to hear Yugoslavia's renowned dissident, Milovan Djilas, talk about nationalism. The police raided, and the state prepared a show trial.    One of the defendants, Pavlusko Imsirovic, returns to the scene of the crime one night (his friend, the owner, is away) to check for plumbing leaks. Mr. Barovic comes along, sits on the bed, opens a bottle of brandy and relives the defense.    &quot;Our tactic,&quot; he says, &quot;was to make the trial last as long as possible. We had observers from all over the world. The bigger the publicity, the smaller the sentence. We objected to everything. The judges had to withdraw to consult 248 times. It ate time like mad.&quot;    After three months of it, the prosecution caved in. It reduced the charges to hostile propaganda. Three of the six were released. It was the first time in Communist Yugoslavia that anyone accused of plotting to overthrow the state went free.    &quot;I think, really, we won that case,&quot; Mr. Barovic says.    Mr. Imsirovic, a veteran dissident, was one of those cleared. He knows now precisely what he will do if the police take him in again.    &quot;I will behave just like in American movies,&quot; he says. &quot;As soon as they lay a hand on me, I'll say, 'I want my lawyer.' That's all. Nothing else. 'I want my lawyer.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
