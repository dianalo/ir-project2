By a 13-0 vote, its directors adopted a popular anti-takeover device known as a poison pill.    But International Paper didn't figure on the wrath of some big shareholders.    &quot;We think poison pills are a bad idea,&quot; says Peter Clapman, an attorney for the College Retirement Equities Fund. CREF isn't an idle kibitzer; it is one of the stock market's biggest investors, with more than $25 billion of assets. It also owns 850,000 shares, or about 1.8%, of International Paper. And CREF officials are crusading against poison pills this year.    In a closely watched test case April 14, International Paper holders will vote on a CREF proposal that could ultimately dismantle the company's poison pill. Institutional shareholders are mounting similar challenges at more than 50 major corporations later this spring. &quot;This is going to be one of the biggest issues at annual meetings this year,&quot; predicts Dan Birch, a proxy solicitor at D.F. King andamp; Co.    Both sides see the poison-pill issue as part of a much wider debate about corporate control. &quot;We don't think managements should insulate themselves from shareholders with a lot of anti-takeover provisions,&quot; says James Martin, chief investment officer at CREF. &quot;Poison pills are just one item on a long list. This happens to be one area where we can get management's attention.&quot;    But institutional investors may be too powerful already, argues Martin Lipton, a New York lawyer who frequently helps companies defend against takeovers. He observes that banks, pension funds and other institutions typically own 40% to 60% of most major companies. The top 200 institutions alone invest more than $1 trillion, according to trade publication surveys.    &quot;These institutional shareholders already control most big corporations,&quot; says Mr. Lipton, a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen andamp; Katz. &quot;They have moved to a short-term philosophy where they routinely back raiders. They don't give management time to implement changes.&quot;    Until a few years ago, poison pills didn't even exist as a possible battleground between institutional investors and management. In 1983, though, lawyers devised the rudiments of a poison pill while helping El Paso Co. respond to a takeover bid by Burlington Northern Inc.    Since then, more than 300 companies have adopted poison pills, including many of the largest U.S. businesses. &quot;It helps give us a level playing field against corporate raiders,&quot; says Ron Soltman, assistant general counsel at Hospital Corp. of America, which adopted a poison pill last year. &quot;It makes sure our shareholders can't be stampeded.&quot;    Poison pills work by giving shareholders the right to buy additional securities at very attractive prices if their company is the target of a hostile bid. That effectively &quot;poisons&quot; the company to a raider by greatly increasing the overall purchase price. Otherwise, though, these rights have little value. And they can be redeemed at a token price if management wants a friendly acquisition to proceed.    Many companies prefer to call poison pills by their formal name of &quot;shareholder rights plans.&quot; Poison pill &quot;is a disaster of a name,&quot; complains Mr. Lipton, who objects to its grim image. Even worse, he says, the term &quot;poison pill&quot; was thought up by Martin Siegel, the one-time Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. investment banker who has since pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges. But other terms &quot;don't have the same catchy sound as poison pill,&quot; Mr. Lipton concedes.    To managements, a poison pill is a quick, easy anti-takeover defense to install. The state Supreme Court in Delaware, where many companies are incorporated, ruled in 1985 that adopting a poison pill is a normal business judgment and needn't be approved by shareholders. Most other anti-takeover measures require holder approval, which isn't always forthcoming.    Not surprisingly, some shareholders argue that poison pills deny them their role, as owners of a company, in evaluating any takeover bid. A few small holders filed suits in 1985, unsuccessfully trying to block poison pills. This year it is the institutions -- with their huge portfolios full of poison-pill stocks, and with their ability to take on a major legal battle -- that are leading the fight.    &quot;Something like a poison pill changes the rules of stock ownership in a very disturbing way,&quot; asserts CREF's Mr. Clapman. &quot;Managements stop being accountable to shareholders.&quot;    Similar objections are made by several other institutions sponsoring resolutions against poison pills this year. These include the California Public Employees Retirement System, the California State Teachers Retirement System, and the Wisconsin Investment Board.    CREF and its allies argue that poison pills hurt stock prices too, by making takeovers more difficult. They cite a study last October by Gregg Jarrell, who was then chief economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It examined 245 poison pill programs, and found that companies' share prices fell an average 1.7%, relative to the market, during the two-day period when a company's poison pill was introduced.    But that study may be flawed, companies with poison pills argue. At Pitney Bowes Inc., for example, a spokesman says share prices may bounce back afterward, as holders decide the poison pill isn't so bad. Pitney Bowes's own share price has climbed considerably since its poison pill was introduced, he observes.    CREF and the other institutions aren't trying to do away with poison pills in one step. Rather, they want companies to hold a vote next year on whether to rescind their poison pills. That way, CREF explains, it can pick up some middle-of-the-road votes this year from holders who feel they should be consulted on poison pills, even if they ultimately are willing to accept them.    Whatever the institutions' strategy, companies generally don't like it. &quot;Our pill serves a legitimate purpose,&quot; says a spokesman for AMR Corp., the holding company for American Airlines. &quot;It gives our board sufficient time to evaluate a takeover and make sure it's beneficial for all shareholders.&quot; Still, says the AMR spokesman, &quot;this isn't a make-or-break issue for us, because we aren't a likely takeover candidate.&quot;    At International Paper, sparks have flown ever since CREF filed its poison-pill proposal last Oct. 30. &quot;We are the first one to come to a vote this spring,&quot; says International Paper spokesman William Greener. &quot;A lot of people will be watching us.&quot; What's more, International Paper has been trying to shore up its takeover defenses for years, amid intermittent rumors that it might be an acquisition target.    As SEC filings show, the tussle between International Paper and CREF started far in advance of next month's vote. International Paper began last December by challenging CREF's proposal as &quot;contrary to New York law.&quot; The poison pill was a dividend to holders, it said, and couldn't be rescinded. In a letter to the SEC, International Paper asked if it could simply omit the CREF proposal from its proxy material this spring.    CREF's lawyers offered to amend their proposal to make clear they were talking about rescinding the poison pill only in the sense of redeeming International Paper's shareholder rights, rather than rescinding the original dividend itself. In a jab typical of the feuding between the two organizations, CREF's lawyers wrote that it was &quot;perfectly clear&quot; what rescind meant, if International Paper and the SEC would only look in Webster's dictionary.    International Paper next faulted CREF for not disclosing that some of its trustees, as well as those of a related organization, the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association, also were directors of companies that had enacted their own poison pills. That's &quot;simply irrelevant,&quot; CREF replied. It said these trustees didn't figure in the CREF decision to campaign against poison pills.    International Paper says it can't comment on its next move until after its board approves the final proxy statement this week. &quot;But you can bet we'll be screaming and hollering after that,&quot; says a source close to International Paper.    Ordinarily, when management opposes a shareholder resolution, that would be decisive. Proxy specialists say most shareholder resolutions contested by management do well if they achieve even 3% of the vote. That is the minimum needed in order for the resolution to be reintroduced at the next annual meeting.    But the resolutions against poison pills seem to have much wider backing. Other institutions such as Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, Alliance Capital Management Corp. and Batterymarch Financial Management Corp. say they generally will vote against poison pills as well. Says Mr. Birch, the proxy solicitor: &quot;The institutions are pretty much against the pill.&quot;    On the other hand, individual holders are almost certain to vote with management, proxy specialists say. Anticipating this split, CREF and the California funds say they have deliberately targeted companies with high institutional ownership -- generally 50% to 80% of total shares. International Paper, for example, was 59% institutionally owned as of last Sept. 30.    Neither side will predict how voting is likely to go. But proxy specialists suggest that institutions could win big minorities, even if their proposals don't carry. One possible outcome, says proxy solicitor Donald Carter, is that institutions win a majority of shares voted but less than 50% of total stock outstanding, because many holders don't vote. In that case, says Mr. Carter, the head of Carter Organization, &quot;It's unclear who really wins.&quot;    Jose Arau, principal proxy officer for the California PERS fund, says: &quot;We'll be happy even if we get 20% to 30% of the overall vote. We think that will send a signal to management.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
