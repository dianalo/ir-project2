Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.) said yesterday's action was probably the panel's last on judges, indicating that confirmation for two key appeals court nominees, Pamela Rymer and Judith Hope, and 12 other court nominees is highly unlikely.    There has been fierce partisan fighting over the judge nominations, with Republican senators threatening to hold up other legislation until the committee moved on the appointments.    The nominations of Ms. Rymer to the appeals court in California and of Mrs. Hope to the important appeals court in Washington, D.C., have been pending since last April. Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), who has often complained about stalling tactics by the Democrats, said he was disappointed neither woman would probably be confirmed. </TEXT></DOC>
