The federal court in the eastern district of Michigan dismissed Rochester Midland's claim against two former employees, Daniel R. Mesko and Roger A. Mesko. Rochester Midland, which produces chemical products for water treatment, solicits sales by performing laboratory analysis on water systems for existing and potential clients. Part of its laboratory work was referred to a company called Water-Wise Inc.    Rochester Midland alleged that, while they were still employed by the company, Roger Mesko became an officer and stockholder of Water-Wise and Daniel Mesko became a salesman for Water-Wise, in violation of their employment contracts with Rochester Midland. The company also alleged that the Meskos solicited business from Rochester Midland's customers and that they used the company's confidential information and trade secrets to aid their efforts.    To state a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, known as RICO, a plaintiff must allege conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, thereby causing injury to the plaintiff's business or property. Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff decided that Rochester Midland had failed properly to allege such a pattern. He ruled that a pattern of racketeering activity doesn't exist where there is just a single illegal scheme, even if several allegedly illegal acts are performed in furtherance of that scheme.    The court said Rochester Midland's complaint also failed to establish the factor of continuity necessary to sustain a claim under RICO. The court determined that the illegal scheme was well-defined but short in duration. Furthermore, the court said, the racketeering activity was likely to end when the objective was achieved, thereby decreasing the likelihood of attracting organized crime.    -- BNA Daily Labor Report</TEXT></DOC>
