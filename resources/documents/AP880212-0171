(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York investor Donald Trump mayseek up to 24.9 percent of MCA Inc., the parent of UniversalStudios, the entertainment conglomerate said Friday.   It has been speculated for more than a year that MCA would be atakeover target, but until now no suitor has emerged.   Some analysts have long contended the company's stock wasundervalued. But it was believed a hostile takeover would bedifficult because MCA is ruled with an iron hand by Lew Wasserman,the last of the old-line movie moguls.   Wasserman, 74, has been with MCA and its forerunner, Music Corp.of America, since 1936.   In a brief announcement, MCA said it had been notified by Trumpthat he owns 375,000 of the company's shares and may seek toacquire 24.9 percent.   MCA has 77.1 million shares outstanding.   MCA's announcement came after the stock market closed, but thecompany's stock already had jumped by $5.25 per share to $45 onrumors that a takeover bid was in the offing.   Like most other companies, MCA's shares took a beating in thestock market crash and never fully recovered. In the past year,their highest price was $64.50.   Trump spokeswoman Norma Foerderer in New York said she had nocomment.   MCA takeover speculation peaked in mid-1987 when Wasserman washospitalized for a prolonged period after what was to have beenroutine surgery to remove a polyp from his colon.   However, Wasserman did return to the helm of the entertainmentgiant after five weeks, reportedly with his corporate powerundiminished.   To dissaude suitors, MCA last July adopted a ``poison-pill''permitting stockholders to buy new shares at half price if ahostile bidder acquired more than 20 percent of MCA or made anunsolicited tender offer for more than 30 percent.   Wasserman's control comes more from the respect he commands thanfrom the stock he controls.   Wasserman owns 6.9 percent of MCA's stock and controls another8.9 percent through a series of trusts, including those of thefamily of MCA founder Jules Stein.   From its beginning as a Hollywood talent-booking agency, MCA hasgrown into a powerhouse in producing movies, televisionprogramming, records and toys.   It operates a successful backlot tour of Universal Studios here,is building one in Florida and has agreed to build one in Japan. Inall three locations, it would be competing with theme parks by itsarch-rival Walt Disney Co.   MCA also is involved in book publishing, retail and mail-orderbusinesses.   In 1987, MCA earned $137.9 million, or $1.97 per share, adecrease of 9 percent from a year earlier when it netted $150.9million, or $1.97 per share.   The decline would have been even more dramatic except that the1986 results already were depressed by a $50 million writeoff tocover bills it was unlikely to collect from independent televisionstations that had used MCA programs.   Trump, who made his fortune in New York real estate, is buildinga casino empire with two hotel-gaming houses already in AtlanticCity, N.J., and a permit pending for a third one.   Trump also is seeking to gain total control of AtlanticCity-based Resorts International Inc. He already owns 90 percent ofthe company's voting power.   In addition, Trump in the past has acquired stakes in takeovertargets and later sold them for a handsome profit.</TEXT></DOC>
