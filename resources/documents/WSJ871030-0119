BishopStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Scientists suffered a setback in their attempts to uncover the cause of Alzheimer's disease, the premature senility and loss of memory that afflicts more than a million elderly Americans.    Three teams of scientists in Boston reported that new experiments failed to confirm a theory they had put forth last February, that a certain type of genetic defect underlies Alzheimer's disease. The theory, and the evidence supporting it, generated considerable excitement and publicity at the time.    As a result of the new experiments, other explanations for Alzheimer's disease will have to be sought, the scientists said. Most of the researchers are connected with Harvard Medical School and its hospitals in the Boston area. They reported their latest and disappointing discoveries in this week's issue of Science magazine.    The research that was widely hailed earlier this year involved studies of the genes of families afflicted with an inherited form of Alzheimer's disease. Such &quot;familial&quot; Alzheimer's disease accounts for only 10% of cases but, because it is so similar to the common &quot;sporadic&quot; form of the disease it is thought that both forms have a similar cause.    In February, the scientists reported they had pinpointed the approximate location of a defective gene that seemed linked to familial Alzheimer's disease. It lay in the same region of genetic material that is involved in Down's syndrome, the form of mental retardation once known as mongolism.    Down's syndrome is known to be caused by an abnormal duplication of a fragment of genetic material. Since the Alzheimer's disease gene is in the same genetic fragment, they theorized, Alzheimer's disease also might be caused by an abnormal duplication of a gene. The theory was bolstered by the fact that the same genetic fragment contains a gene for a protein called the amyloid B protein and excess amounts of this protein are found in brain tissues of Alzheimer's patients. Perhaps, they speculated, duplication of the amyloid B gene was the cause of Alzheimer's disease.    In the new experiments, the researchers probed carefully through the genes of Alzheimer's disease patients and failed to find any evidence that the genetic fragment or any of its genes, including the amyloid B protein gene, are abnormally duplicated. The amount of genetic material containing the suspect genes isn't any greater than in healthy people and less than in Down's syndrome patients, they reported.    The experiments are unrelated to a more optimistic finding reported a week ago. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh said they found evidence of an inherited abnormality in the blood cells of several Alzheimer's disease patients who were related. This indicated the family is haunted by a defective gene that might be the cause of their common affliction. Discovery of the gene might lead to new insights on how Alzheimer's disease comes about. </TEXT></DOC>
