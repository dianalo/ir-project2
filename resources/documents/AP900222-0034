The cost-cutting measures were worked out in the last few weekssince Bush's budget proposal was sent to Congress, Justicespokesman David Runkel said Wednesday.   The proposed budget would have forced the FBI to cut more than400 agents from its workforce of more than 10,000, probably throughattrition, to finance an estimated $42 million in additionalovertime expenses.   A new law passed by Congress last year increases the overtimepay for federal law enforcement officers, including FBI agents.   Under the new plan to pay for the overtime costs, the FBI willstagger the hiring of 338 new agents provided in the 1991 budget toinvestigate organized crime, drugs and white-collar fraud, said anFBI official.   Their hiring will be spread out over the 1991 fiscal year tosave money, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The FBI also will postpone the purchase of some new equipment, theofficial said.</TEXT><HEAD>Cavazos Sticks With Troubled Loan Program</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos says hewill continue supporting federally guaranteed loans for students inprivate vocational and technical schools even though their defaultrate is 37 percent.   ``I want to make it clear that in no way does the Secretary ofEducation advocate stepping away from support of guaranteed studentloan programs for proprietary schools,'' Cavazos told a SenateAppropriations subcommittee Wednesday.   However, Cavazos said the administration was determined to crackdown on institutions with high rates of default.   Proprietary schools are privately owned institutions that teachtrades such as electronics or auto repair.   Overall, counting loans for regular college attendance, therewere 1.9 million defaults in the guaranteed student loan program in1989, and the projected number this year is 2 million.   Cavazos was testifying on President Bush's educational budgetrequest of $25 billion, up more than $500 million from the 1990budget. He noted the federal contribution is about 6 percent of thenation's total expenditure of $353 billion for the current schoolyear.</TEXT><HEAD>Official Says Nuclear Arms Plant to Remain Idle Until Summer</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rocky Flats weapons plant in Colorado,closed indefinitely late last year for safety and managementimprovements, is unlikely to resume full production until at leastJuly, a senior Energy Department official says.   The plant, situated about 16 miles northwest of Denver, is thesole supplier of plutonium triggers for U.S. nuclear warheads,which are vital to maintaining the nuclear weapons stockpile.   Neither the Energy Department nor the Pentagon has said how longRocky Flats could remain out of service before the arms stockpilewould be jeopardized.   The plant also was closed for a few months in 1988 after aworker was contaminated by radioactivity.   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had said shortly after thelatest shutdown that he hoped Rocky Flats would resume productionby February, but the contractor that runs the facility says itneeds more time to install new safety procedures and retrainworkers.   Adm. J.M. Barr, the deputy assistant energy secretary formilitary application, said Wednesday that one of the key plutoniumprocessing facilities could be ready to resume operation by the endof June.   Barr said current plans called for the full resumption of RockyFlats production sometime between July and September, although thatwas subject to revision.   Barr told the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety,which is monitoring progress toward resuming operations, that hewould have a more specific target date ``very early in April.''   Barr stressed that the final decision to resume productionrested with Watkins, who in recent weeks has pledged to subject theplant overhaul to a full review by independent observers.   Rocky Flats has been plagued by a variety of operating andwaste-handling problems in recent years.</TEXT></DOC>
