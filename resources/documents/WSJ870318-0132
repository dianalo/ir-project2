Consolidated Energy, which is majority-owned by Consolidated Oil andamp; Gas Inc., also of Denver, said Consolidated Operating defaulted on a principal payment of $10 million due to First Interstate Bank of California, a First Interstate Bancorp. unit, and RepublicBank Dallas, a unit of RepublicBank Corp. The company said it sought an extension to make the payment, but it was denied. The loan originally was made in October 1985 to refinance debt. Consolidated Energy owns 99% of Consolidated Operating.    The Chapter 11 filing, which allows the partnership to continue operating while it works out a plan to pay debt, didn't list assets and liabilities. But Samuel Butler, president of Columbus Energy Corp., managing partner of both partnerships and a unit of Consolidated Oil andamp; Gas, said the value of the oil and natural gas properties owned by Consolidated Operating Partners &quot;substantially exceeds&quot; the $46.3 million it owes the banks. Other debt totals about $530,000. The company said it plans to file a reorganization plan within 90 days.    A spokesman for Consolidated Energy Partners said management doesn't expect that the bankruptcy-law filing will have a significant effect on the energy partnership because the collateral on the loans is the energy properties owned by Consolidated Operating Partners. In the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, Consolidated Energy Partners posted a net loss of $5.1 million on revenue of $6.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
