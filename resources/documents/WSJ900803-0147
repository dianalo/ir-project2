The Nikkei index of 225issues, which was off 197.67 points Wednesday, fell 592.81 to30245.18, the market's sixth decline in the past sevensessions.   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index continued its declineand ended the morning session at 29953.47, down 291.71points. Earlier, it had been off more than 500 points.</LP><TEXT>   Fallout from the Mideast situation blanketed the world'sstock markets, most of which posted steep declines because ofconcerns about the potential economic effects. London shareprices finished a dismal session sharply lower and at theday's minimums, on the heels of Iraq's invasion and theaccompanying repercussions from higher global oil prices.   At one point in Tokyo, the benchmark index plunged belowthe 30000 mark, as the currency and bond markets alsoweakened, but stocks recovered as selling was absorbed.Program buying linked to indexes helped prices reboundmoderately from intraday lows. Trading volume was light, withabout 400 million shares changing hands in the first section,down from 439.9 million shares on Wednesday. The Tokyo StockPrice Index, or Topix, of all first section issues, whichfell 5.88 points Wednesday, dropped 31.25 to 2215.43. Thesecond section index, which added 13.93 points a day earlier,rose 8.13 to 4444.39, on volume estimated at 37.74 millionshares, up from 37.216 million shares Wednesday.   Analysts said the decline was prompted by worries that theconflict in the Middle East might lead to steep increases inthe price of crude oil, which in turn could raise costs forJapanese manufacturers. Japan relies on imports for roughlytwo-thirds of its energy needs and is the world's largestimporter of crude oil. Only 6.6% of Japan's oil imports comefrom Kuwait, but the fear among investors in Japan is that bytaking control of Kuwait, Iraq will be in a stronger positionto persuade other oil-producing nations to raise theirprices. The dollar's rise on the yen, sparked by safe-havenbuying as an inflation hedge on the Iraq-Kuwait news, alsoswayed stock market sentiment, traders said.   To forestall the threat to the market of the possibilitythat higher oil prices could translate into inflation,analysts said, the Bank of Japan might raise interest rates.Most analysts attributed the poor performance of the Tokyoexchange in recent weeks to investor fears that central bankofficials might make good on hints about another increase inthe discount rate, the interest rate that the central bankcharges on loans to financial institutions. Before newsreports of the Iraqi incursion, many observers believed thestock market had declined enough to discount the potentialeffect of a rate change. Now they aren't so sure.   &quot;If you'd asked me yesterday if this market could slip toits April low, I'd have told you definitely not,&quot; JamesVestal, an economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Co., said.&quot;It's difficult to see why the market should sell itself offin the absence of some sort of external shock. But now we'llhave to wait and see.&quot;   &quot;Basically, everything is pointing in the direction ofhigher interest rates,&quot; Russell Jones, an analyst withUBS-Phillips and Drew International Ltd., a Britishsecurities concern, said. &quot;If crude oil reaches $25 a barrel,its very hard to see how the Bank of Japan can avoid puttingthe {discount rate} up again.&quot;   The dreary outlook is further clouded by concerns that theIraqi incursion may result in a withdrawal of Kuwaitiinvestments from the Tokyo market. One of the world's largestinvestors, the Kuwaiti government has more than $100 billioninvested overseas, about $8 billion of this in Japan,according to the Japan-Kuwait Friendship Society.   Morihiko Iida, a senior strategist at Morgan StanleyInvestment Trust Co., believes the Tokyo market will shakeoff jitters about oil prices and rebound within two or threeweeks. He said the market's afternoon rally demonstrates itsresilience.   Peter Tasker, a strategist at Kleinwort Benson Co., aBritish securities company, wasn't so upbeat. &quot;You'd have tobe very, very optimistic to come and buy in this market now,&quot;he said. &quot;I see no indication that the downtrend isfinished.&quot;   Trading volume has been off nearly two-thirds since theTokyo market plunged nearly 28% in the first quarter, andnews of the Iraqi move helped keep Japan's already sluggishinvestors out of the market. &quot;With all the other negativesaround, investors are saying, `Here's even more reason to siton your hands,'&quot; Stuart Matthews, an analyst with Barclays deZoete Wedd Securities (Japan) Ltd., a British brokeragehouse, said. &quot;There's a lot of uncertainty and a lot ofrisk.&quot;   The risk of higher energy prices has a strongpsychological effect on Japanese investors, analysts said,because of the national trauma stirred by oil crises in the1970s. Sharp increases in crude oil prices in 1973 and 1974triggered severe inflation in Japan and forced Japanesecompanies to restructure their manufacturing operationssignificantly.   Teikoku Oil rose 60 yen to 1,360 yen ($9.24), Nippon Oilrose 40 to 1,430 and Mitsubishi Oil was unchanged at 1,320.   Interest was strong in high-priced blue chips, led bygains in Nintendo, which ended at 31,200, up 1,800. NipponTelegraph andamp; Telephone rose 20,000 to 1.06 million.Seven-Eleven rose 90 to 8,790.   Nippon Mining rose 27 to 919, Mitsubishi Mining was up 4at 735, Mitsubishi Metal advanced 19 to 880, and SumitomoMining added 10 to 1,560. Asahi Diamond closed at 3,000, up10.   Domestic stocks sensitive to interest rates, particularlyshipbuilding, construction and steel, were much lower.Ohbayashi Corp. lost 30 to 1,500, Nippon Hodo fell 100 to3,580, Maeda Construction was down 70 at 2,010, and Kajimafell 30 to 1,690. Taisei Corp. fell 40 to 1,160, and ShimizuCorp. sank 40 to 1,840. Nisshin Steel fell 13 to 805,Kawasaki Steel was down 9 at 509, and Daido Steel fell 8 to870.   In London, excluding the oil sector, stocks were knockedbroadly lower, as the market interpreted the events in thePersian Gulf to mean that higher oil prices would boostBritain's inflation rate, now 9.8%, and keep British baseinterest rates at least at current 15% levels. Wall Street'ssharp decline also was a drag on the London market,commentators said.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell34.5 points to 2304.5, which also was the intraday low andwell below the opening peak of 2347.9. Volume was a brisk561.5 million shares, compared with 419.2 million shares aday earlier, though 77 million shares of Thursday's totalwere traded in British Petroleum alone. The Financial Times30-share index lost 41.4 to 1811.4.   While the prospect of higher oil prices helps correct thebalance-of-payments shortfall in Britain, Paul Harrison, avice president at Salomon Brothers International in London,said it &quot;does little to alleviate the pressure on inflation.&quot;Moreover, the government has said evidence of lower inflationis needed before the pound enters the exchange-rate mechanismof the European Monetary System, which now could be delayed,he said.   But market watchers generally said they didn't see anypanic selling during the session. The major performer wasBritish Petroleum, which advanced 21 pence to 361 pence($6.70). BP shares were viewed as most vulnerable to anysupply disruptions in the Middle East. Kuwait's investmentarm owns a 9.9% stake in BP.   Shell Transport andamp; Trading added 13 to 496, on robustvolume of 14 million shares. Enterprise Oil rose 8 to 676,Ultramar gained 7 to 349, and Lasmo advanced 17 to 461.   Sectors sensitive to interest rates were severelydisrupted, with building and property issues hit hardest.Land Securities shed 17 to 513, British Land skidded 16 to292, Tarmac dropped 10 to 260, Hammerson lost 14 to 685, andTrafalgar House retreated 12 to 283.   British Aerospace rose 5 to 564, because of the increasedtension in the Mideast. The company supplies arms to theregion and is the main contractor for the Al Yamamahagreements with Saudi Arabia.   Elsewhere, stock prices retreated broadly in Paris,Frankfurt, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid, slid on thin tradingin Zurich, and tumbled across the board in Amsterdam, all onworries about the Iraqi military action's effect on oilprices, inflation and interest rates. Brussels prices fell,though most oil stocks there fared well on the Kuwaiti news.South African gold stocks closed sharply higher.   Share prices closed higher in Sydney and Manila, and lowerin Taipei, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and Wellington. TheSydney stock market surged after the government unexpectedlyeased domestic interest rates, and the Mideast news helpedpropel gold and oil shares. Stocks plummeted in Hong Kong andfell sharply in Singapore and Taipei on the invasion report.Manila equities were buoyed by speculation that gold willrise, because of the Iraqi move. Wellington prices fellsharply in continuing fallout from Wednesday's jump indomestic interest rates.
