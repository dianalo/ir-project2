The legislation, which was passed by the House of Commons last month, is designed to reduce personal income taxes and increase corporate taxes. It is expected to be one of the last major pieces of legislation to be enacted before Prime Minister Brian Mulroney calls an election this fall.    The government estimated that corporate taxes will increase 10% over the next five years as a result of the elimination of various tax preferences and loopholes. It also estimated that the number of profitable corporations not paying tax will be reduced by 50%.    The legislation also is expected to reduce income taxes for 85% of Canadian households. It cuts to three from 10 the number of personal tax brackets. And to make the tax system &quot;fairer and more progressive,&quot; the legislation converts personal exemptions and many deductions to tax credits. The new personal income tax rates are 17% on taxable income under 27,500 Canadian dollars (US$22,190), 26% on taxable income from C$27,501 to C$55,000 and 29% on taxable income over C$55,000. A typical provincial government adds 55% tax to the federal rates.    Some tax analysts have criticized the legislation for being less ambitious than the 1986 U.S. tax act, which made bigger cuts in personal tax rates. Except for the switch to tax credits from exemptions and deductions, the legislation doesn't fundamentally change the tax system, said Arthur Drache, an Ottawa tax consultant. He said most of the revisions involve changes in rates and elimination of loopholes, which can be done in the government's annual budget.    Canadians have reacted skeptically to the government's claim that the tax changes were designed to provide greater fairness to the system, particularly for low income taxpayers. A recent poll said 60% believe wealthy Canadians will benefit most from the revisions.    The government's scope for tax cuts was limited by its big spending commitments. Government spending in Canada amounts to 46% of gross domestic product compared with 37% in the U.S.    As a planned second stage of tax reform, the Canadian government is trying to get provincial support for a new national sales tax that would replace existing federal and provincial sales taxes. &quot;We have made some progress, but there is a great deal more to be explored,&quot; said Finance Minister Michael Wilson. Mr. Drache said he doubted the government would get a new national sales tax. &quot;Everybody agrees the current sales tax system is lousy,&quot; he said. But he said &quot;no one can agree on how to change it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
