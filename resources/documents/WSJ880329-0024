The Houston energy-development concern said the equity partners in the transaction reached an impasse with proposed lender, Prudential Capital Corp., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N.J., during final negotiations.    PSE said it and its equity partners, investment partnerships formed with institutional investors by the FPL Energy Services Inc. unit of FPL Group Inc., a Miami utility holding company, have initiated negotiations with another lender. Talks are continuing with Prudential Capital, PSE said, although &quot;it appears unlikely that the parties would be able to close the proposed loans.&quot;    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, PSE was unchanged at $4.375 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
