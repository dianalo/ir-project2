At a luncheon reception for Kitty Dukakis hosted by theDemocratic National Committee, Dukakis spoke of a North Carolinawoman who approached him and promised her support.   Dukakis said he asked the reason for the endorsement and wastold: ``Your wife smokes.''   ``I don't have to tell you what kind of first lady she is goingto be,'' Dukakis said as his wife stood at his side. ``Anon-smoking first lady,'' he added, winning laughter from the crowd.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   Dukakis, known for his thriftiness, tried in vain Wednesday toreturn a gift T-shirt because he said it was too big.   After an anti-drug rally in Conyers, not far from the conventioncity, the trim Dukakis was presented with a shirt bearing the logoof the local Boys Club. As he held it up for photographers, Dukakisglanced down at the tag.   ``I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth,'' he said, ``but I'dlove to wear this this afternoon when I'm working out in PiedmontPark. It's an extra large and that's a little big on me. If you'vegot something a little smaller I could wear it.''   Organizers of the event looked on awkwardly, as did Dukakis'wife, Kitty, who also received a shirt from the local Girls Club.   Dukakis kept the shirt.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   At a made-for-TV convention, the Dukakis campaign has floodedThe Omni arena with made-for-TV signs.   Gone are the placards the campaign has used for more than ayear. They were predominantly white with blue lettering that read:``Mike Dukakis for President.''   The new signs match the red, white and blue colors of theconvention rostrum. The have large lettering reading, ``DUKAKIS,''and a smaller tag line that reads ``President '88.''   And they come in two sizes.   Two people are needed to wave the larger signs effectively,while a lone supporter can handle the smaller models.   All told, 1,000 of the larger versions have been distributed onthe Omni floor, and 20,000 of the smaller models.   Another Dukakis sign is to be unveiled Wednesday night asDukakis is nominated for the presidency. It says: ``Duke. DukeDuke.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   After spending five days in steamy Atlanta, Dukakis and hisrunning mate, Lloyd Bentsen, will hit the campaign trail togetherfor three days.
