U.S. District Judge Richard Owen slapped a new injunctionTuesday on Taiwanese businessman Fred C. Lee, but denied aSecurities and Exchange Commission's request to hold him incontempt for trying to transfer the money overseas earlier thismonth.   Lee, 38, was accused by the SEC last month of making $19 millionin stock profits by illegally trading on inside information heallegedly bought from Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., 24, a rookieanalyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.   The SEC got a temporary restraining order at the time, freezingthe assets of both men. It has demanded the pair return the $19million plus triple damages for a total of $76 million, thesecond-largest insider trading case since the record $100 millionIvan Boesky scandal broke nearly two years ago.   In court filings this week, the SEC also provided new detailsabout the case, asserting Lee maintained contact with several younganalysts and tried unsuccessfully to recruit one at First BostonCo. to join his alleged scheme.   The filings further asserted that Lee talked with Wang at leastonce daily by telephone and traded through dozens of accounts inother names, including one in the name of Lee's Zen Buddhist priest.   Sworn statements by six of Wang's colleagues contained in theSEC filings indicated he was intimately familiar with much of theirwork and sometimes may have pumped them for information.   In the court proceeding Tuesday, the SEC claimed Lee hadattempted to withdraw ``several million dollars'' from accounts hehas at Standard Chartered Bank in lower Manhattan.   Lee was accused of sending a letter through his Hong Kong lawyerto Standard Charter's Hong Kong branch last week in an attempt totransfer the funds.   Owen granted the government's request for the preliminaryinjunction, but did not find Lee in contempt of court, as the SEChad requested. He also extended for two weeks the temporary orderfreezing Wang's assets.   Lee, who maintains residences in Hong Kong, Taiwan and theUnited States, has indicated through his lawyer, Michael Perlis, hewould fight the SEC accusations. Wang's attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin,has not divulged how his client would respond.</TEXT></DOC>
