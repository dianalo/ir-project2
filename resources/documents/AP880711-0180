Its rapidpopulation growth, outstripping Soviet Europe's, is making thistraditionally Moslem area the new Soviet heartland.</TEXT><BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ASHKHABAD, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The hot evening air was laden withyellow dust from the Kara Kum Desert when dark-eyed Murad Khydyrovwas born in a maple-shaded hospital and swaddled in a long whitecloth.   Delivered by midwife Maria Trafimova, the infant, one of 120,000born each year in the arid, oil-rich Soviet republic of Turkmenia,tilted his nation's demographic balance a bit more away from theSlavic North and toward the Moslem South.   Sprawling over an area half the size of the continental UnitedStates and peopled by more than 47 million inhabitants drawn from arich, multi-hued palette of ethnic groups, Soviet Central Asia isnow riding a demographic boom that is making it the country's newheartland.   Soviet Tadzhikistan alone has more than 30,000 bemedaled ``heromothers'' with 10 or more children each. In Turkmenia, children 14and younger are 40 percent of the total population, and a majorityin some areas. Uzbekistan's overtaxed schools work double shifts.   Exactly when Central Asians will outnumber their Europeancountrymen is in dispute. But an Asian majority that is largelyMoslem in customs and rural in lifestyle is forming. As it does, itpresents difficult problems for the Kremlin leadership, which forseven decades has been dominated by Slavs and other urbanizedEuropeans.   Despite its demographic dynamism, Central Asia wields littlepolitical clout on the national scene. None of its natives sits onthe Politburo, the Communist Party's ruling body, nor do CentralAsians wield heavy responsibility in the Moscow-based centralgovernment.   At the same time, the region _ from the blond-tinted deserts ofTurkmenia to ``the roof of the Soviet Union,'' the glacier-lacedpeaks of the Pamirs in Tadzhikistan, _ is wrestling with thedemands of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for economic and socialchange.   Statistics show ``perestroika,'' the Kremlin's campaign fornational economic renewal, is making slow headway in the fiverepublics of Soviet Central Asia _ Turkmenia, Tadzhikistan,Kazakhstan, Kirgizia and Uzbekistan.   ``Before the revolution, the beys and emirs ruled here,'' saysKhodzhimakhmud Umarov, an official of the State Economic Instituteof Tadzhikistan. ``After the revolution, the people kept onreceiving orders. Most are villagers and their psychology isattuned to the command economy.''   Gorbachev is pushing for tougher educational standards, butCentral Asia has always lagged behind the rest of the country inschooling and continues to do so.   The Kremlin wants to mobilize all labor resources, but there aremore idle hands in the new Soviet heartland than anywhere else, andthey show little inclination to move where the jobs are: the frigidRussian North and Siberia.   Central Asia faces burgeoning underemployment due to te rapidpopulation rise, and a cautious program launched last year topromote ``family planning'' as a means of slowing population growthhas run into opposition from many traditionally minded women.   In Turkemenia, implantation of intrauterine contraceptivedevices is free. ``The technology exists,'' says the healthminister, Kurban B. Chagilov. ``What we have to do is spread theknowledge and overcome the repugnance.''   ``Abortion and contraceptives are regarded here aschild-killing,'' says Dr. Yakub T. Tadzhiev, a prominent Tadzhikpublic health specialist. ``It's almost unheard of for rural womento use contraceptives.''   Clashes between old and new are common in Central Asia. Marxismco-exists here with Islam and Sufi mysticism. Rampant corruptionand criminal clans not only survive but flourish.   Rockets bearing cosmonauts shoot skyward from the BaikonurCosmodrome on the desolate steppes of Kazakhstan, making CentralAsia the Soviet gate to space. But a lack of water mains in manyareas forces families to draw their drinking water frommicrobe-infested irrigation ditches.   Colossal state-of-the-art dams in mountainous Tadzhikistangenerate 15 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to drivesprawling industrial complexes. But in the lush emerald hills, abride can still be bought for up to $16,000.   Decades of atheistic propaganda by the party, government andstate-sponsored Znaniye (Knowledge) Society, as well as thesubjugation of the Islamic clergy to the state, have failed toshake the faith of millions of Central Asians.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
