The Austria Press Agency quoted unidentified law enforcementofficials in Eisenstadt near the border as saying the East Germanscrossed into Austria overnight individually or in small familygroups.   That marked a change from recent mass escape attempts.   Hungary announced Friday that it would increase its contingent ofborder guards because they have been overwhelmed by up to 500escapees at a time.   The flight of politically and economically disenchanted EastGermans into Austria began after Hungary tore down most of thebarriers on its side of the border in May. The move was welcomed inthe West as a sign of liberalization in Hungary, one of the Sovietbloc's most reform-minded countries.   But it has led to tensions with East Germany, which has declinedto follow the East bloc reform movement, which began in the SovietUnion.   West German officials estimate that since July 5,000 East Germanswith little chance of legal travel to the West have used Hungary _ aWarsaw Pact ally that they can visit freely _ as an illegal transitpoint to the West.   West Germany, which welcomes all East Germans immigrants, hasexerted pressure on Hungary as well, calling for a humane solutionto the problem.   Hundreds of East Germans also are refusing to leave West Germandiplomatic property in Budapest, Hungary; Prague, Czechoslovakia;and East Berlin, unless they are guaranteed safe passage to WestGermany.</TEXT></DOC>
