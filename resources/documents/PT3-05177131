These compositions are widely used, for example, as sealing materials,      coating materials, and adhesives in the fields of building industry,      engineering industry, electrical industry, etc. </PAR><PAR>  The above-mentioned conventional room temperature curing organopolysiloxane      compositions have, however, defects that after the curing the rubber      strength is weak and the durability against acid compounds and basic      compounds is poor. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a room      temperature curing composition which, after the curing, is high in rubber      strength and excellent in chemical resistance. </PAR><PAR>  The present room temperature curing composition comprises (A) an      organopolysilethylenesiloxane whose both ends are blocked with hydroxyl      groups, represented by the following general formula andlsqb;Iandrsqb;:      ##STR2##      wherein R.sup.1 to R.sup.4, which may be the same or different, each      represent an unsubstituted or substituted monovalent hydrocarbon group      having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and n is an integer of 10 or above </PAR><PAR>  and </PAR><PAL>  (B) at least one compound selected from the group consisting of      organosilanes and organosiloxanes having two or more hydrolyzable groups      in the molecule. </PAL><PAR>  The composition can form a cured product high in rubber strength and      excellent in resistance to acids, alkalis, and the like. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In the present invention, the organopolysilethylenesiloxane used as a base      component is represented by the above general formula andlsqb;Iandrsqb; and as apparent      from the general formula, the both ends of the molecular chain are blocked      with hydroxyl groups. </PAR><PAR>  In the general formula andlsqb;Iandrsqb;, each group of R.sup.1 to R.sup.4 is a      substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10      carbon atoms and examples thereof are a lower alkyl group having 8 or less      carbon atoms such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, and a      butyl group, a cycloalkyl group such as a cyclohexyl group, an alkenyl      group such as a vinyl group, an allyl group, a propenyl group, and a      butenyl group, an aryl group such as a phenyl group, a tolyl group, and a      naphthyl group, an aralkyl group such as a benzyl group and a 2-phenyl      group, and a group formed by substituting part or all of the hydrogen      atoms of these groups by halogen atoms or cyano groups such as a      2-cyanoethyl group, a 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl group, a      6,6,6,5,5,4,4,3,3-nonafluorohexyl group, a chloromethyl group, and a      3-chloropropyl group. These groups of R.sup.1 to R.sup.4 may be the same      or different. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, R.sup.1 to R.sup.4 preferably each represent a      group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, particularly preferably a lower alkyl      group having 8 or less carbon atoms or a phenyl group. </PAR><PAR>  In the general formula andlsqb;Iandrsqb;, n is an integer of 10 or over, preferably an      integer of 10 to 5,000, and most preferably an integer of 10 to 1,000. In      conjunction with such a value of n, the viscosity of the      organopolysilethylenesiloxane of the component (A) at 25.degree. C. falls      to 25 cSt or over, preferably in the range of 25 to 1,000,000 cSt, and      most preferably 1,000 to 100,000 cSt. </PAR><PAR>  Organopolysilethylenesiloxanes particularly preferably used in the present      invention are:      ##STR3##      wherein, in the above formulas, n is an integer of 10 to 5,000. </PAR><PAR>  The above organopolysilethylenesiloxanes may be used singly or as a mixture      of two or mcre. </PAR><PAC>  Components (B) </PAC><PAR>  In the present invention, in combination with the above      organopolysilethylenesiloxane, an organosilane and/or an organosiloxane      having at least two hydrolyzable groups in the molecule is used. The      hydrolyzable groups act as reaction active sites to cause a crosslinking      reaction to take place between the hydroxyl groups of both ends of the      molecular chain of the organopolysilethylenesiloxane and the organosilane      or the organosiloxane. Examples of such a hydrolyzable group include an      alkoxy group such as a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, a propoxy group, a      methoxyethoxy group, and an ethoxyethoxy group; an acyloxy group such as      acetoxy group, a propionoxy group, and a butyloxy group; an alkenyloxy      group such as a propenyloxy group and an isobutenyloxy group; an iminoxy      group such as a dimethylketoxime group, a methylethylkotoxime group, a      diethylketoxime group, a cyclopentanoxime group, and a cyclohexanoxime      group; an amino group such as an N-methylamino group, an N-ethylamino      group, an N-propylamino group, an N-butylamino group, an N,N-dimethylamino      group, and an N,N-diethylamino group; an amido group such as an      N-methylacetamido group and an N-ethylacetamido group; and an aminooxy      group such as an N,N-dimethylaminooxy group and an N,N-diethylaminooxy      group. </PAR><PAR>  Besides these hydrolyzable groups, the substituent bonded to the silicon      atom includes an unsubstituted or substituted monovalent hydrocarbon group      having 1 to 10 carbon atoms like those mentioned for R.sup.1 to R.sup.4 in      the general formula andlsqb;Iandrsqb; </PAR><PAR>  Specific examples of the organosilane and the organosiloxane having at      least two hydrolyzable groups mentioned above are the following: </PAR><PAR>  The organosilane includes, for example, an alkoxysilane such as      methyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane,      3,3,3-trifluoropyrutrimethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, and      tetraethoxysilane, and a partially hydrolyzed product thereof; a      trioximosilane such as methyltris(methylethylketoximo)silane and      vinyltris(methylethylketoximo)silane; an acetoxysilane such as      methyltriacetoxysilane, ethyltriacetoxysilane, phenyltriacetoxysilane,      6,6,6,5,5,4,4,3,3-nonafluorohexyltriacetoxysilane, and tetraaectoxysilane;      an isopropenoxysilane such as methyltriisopropenoxysilane,      vinyltriisopropenoxysilane, phenyltriisopropenoxysilane,      6,6,6,5,5,4,4,3,3-nonafluorohexyltriisopropenoxysilane, and      tetraisopropenoxysilane; a triaminosilane such as      methyltris(diethylamino)silane and vinyltris(dicyclohexylamino)silane; an      amidosilane such as methyltriethylacetamidosilane,      phenyltrimethylacetamidosilane, and vinyldiethylacetamidosilane; and a      trifluoroethoxysilane such as methyltris(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)silane,      vinyltris(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)silane, and      tetrakis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)silane. </PAR><PAR>  The organosiloxane includes, for example, an aminoxysiloxane such as      1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1,3-dipropyl-5,7-bis(diethylaminoxy)cyclotetrasiloxane      and      1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1-propyl-3,5,7-tris(diethylamioxy)cyclotetrasiloxane. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, among the above-mentioned organosilanes and      organosiloxanes, particularly vinyltriethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane      and a partially hydrolyzed product of these,      methyltris(methylethylketoxime)silane, methyltriacetoxysilane,      vinyltriisopropenoxysilane, and      1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1-propyl-3,5,7-tris(diethylaminoxy)cyclotetrasiloxane      are preferably used. </PAR><PAR>  These organosilanes and organosiloxanes may be used singly or as a mixture      of two or more and generally it is preferable that they are used in an      amount of 0.5 to 25 parts by weight, particularly 1 to 10 parts by weight,      per 100 parts by weight of the organopolysilethylenesiloxane of the      component (A). If the amount to be blended is less than the above range,      sometimes the composition gels during its production or storage or the      elastomeric body obtained therefrom will not exhibit the intended      properties. On the other hand, if the amount to be blended exceeds the      above range, the degree of shrinkage becomes large when the composition is      cured and the elasticity of the cured product tends to lower. </PAR><PAC>  Other Ingredients </PAC><PAR>  The present composition may be blended with a surface active agent having      at least one fluorine atom in the molecule (hereinafter referred to as a      fluorine type surface active agent), thereby the stain resistance can be      remarkably improved. That is, the cured product made of the present room      temperature curing composition blended with a fluorine type surface active      agent can effectively prevent dust or the like from adhering to the      surface thereof. </PAR><PAR>  As the fluorine type surface active agent, any fluorine type surface active      agent can be used so long as it has at least one fluorine atom in the      molecule and for example an amphoteric one, an anionic one, a cationic      one, and a nonionic one can be used. In the present invention, specific      examples of the fluorine type surface active agent that are preferably      used are the following: </PAR><PAR>  Amphoteric surface active agents represented by the following general      formulas (a) to (e):      ##STR4##      wherein, in the above formulas, R represents a monovalent organic group,      for example, a monovalent hydrocarbon group, e.g., an alkyl group having 1      to 8 carbon atoms such as a methyl group and an ethyl group and an aryl      group such as a phenyl group and a tolyl group; A represents a      hydroxyalkyl group or an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and n, m,      k and q are each a positive integer. </PAR><PAR>  Anionic surface active agents represented by the following general formulas      (f) and (g): </PAR><EQU>  C.sub.n F.sub.2nandplus;1 SO.sub.3 M and                          (f) </EQU><EQU>  C.sub.n F.sub.2nandplus;1 COOM,                                   (g) </EQU><PAL>  wherein, in the above formulas, M represents a hydrogen atom or an alkali      metal atom such as a sodium atom and a potassium atom, and n is a positive      integer. </PAL><PAR>  Cationic surface active agents represented by the following general      formulas (h) and (i): </PAR><EQU>  C.sub.n F.sub.2nandplus;1 SO.sub.2 NH(CH.sub.2).sub.m N.sup..sym. R.sub.3      X.sup..crclbar., and                                      (h) </EQU><EQU>  C.sub.n F.sub.2nandplus;1 COONH(CH.sub.2).sub.m N.sup..sym. R.sub.3      X.sup..crclbar.,                                          (i) </EQU><PAL>  wherein, in the above formulas, X represents a halogen atom and R, m, and n      have the meaning defined above. </PAL><PAR>  Nonionic surface active agents represented by the following general formula      (j): </PAR><EQU>  C.sub.n F.sub.2nandplus;1 SO.sub.2 NR(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.p H (j) </EQU><PAL>  wherein p is an integer and R and n have the meaning defined above. </PAL><PAR>  In the present invention, among the above surface active agents, amphoteric      surface active agents are preferable and in particular amphoteric surface      active agents represented by the above general formula (b) are preferably      used. The most preferably used amphoteric surface active agent is one the      surface tension of the 0.01 wt. % aqueous solution of which is 60 dyn/cm      or less. The composition with which such a surface active agent has been      blended is useful as a sealing agent, a coating agent, or the like in the      field of building industry. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, these fluorine type surface active agents are      used singly or as a mixture of two or more and generally it is desirable      that the fluorine type surface active agent is blended in an amount of      0.01 to 5.0 parts by weight, particularly 0.1 to 2.0 parts by weight, per      100 parts by weight of the component (A). If the amount is less than 0.01      part by weight, the intended effect of the stain resistance will not be      secured to an adequate extent while if the amount exceeds 5.0 parts by      weight, after the curing, the adhesion and the hardness and the mechanical      strength of the sealant tend to lower. </PAR><PAR>  In the present composition, it is preferable to blend a curing catalyst in      order to effect the curing effectively at room temperature in the presence      of moisture. As the curing catalyst, curing catalysts conventionally used      for condensation curing organopolysiloxane compositions can be used and an      organotin compound such as dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin octoate,      dibutyltin dimethoxide, and tin dioctoate, a titanium compound such as      tetraisopropoxy titanate and a guanidyl group containing silane such as      tetramethylguanidylpropyltrimethoxysilane can be exemplified. </PAR><PAR>  Generally it is desirable that the curing catalyst is blended in an amount      of up to 5.0 parts by weight, particularly 0.1 to 1.0 part by weight, per      100 parts by weight of the component (A). If the amount is too excessive,      not only the period for the formation of a coat becomes several seconds,      which is quite short, lowering the workability, but also disadvantages      such as a color change at the time of heating will occur sometimes. </PAR><PAR>  Further, in the present composition, so long as the purposes of the present      invention of, for example, improving the rubber strength after the curing      are not damaged, additives that are conventionally used this type of      composition can be blended. For example, a reinforcing agent such as fumed      silica, precipitated silica, carbon powder, titanium dioxide, aluminum      oxide, quartz powder, talc, sericite, and bentonite, a fibrous filler such      as asbestos, glass fiber, and organic fibers, an oil resistance improver      such as potassium methacrylate, a colorant, a heat resistance improver      such as red oxide and cerium oxide, a cold resistance improver, a      thixotropic agent such as polyethers, a dehydrating agent, an adhesion      improver such as .gamma.-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and a fire retardancy      improver such as platinum compounds may optionally be blended as required. </PAR><PAC>  Room Temperature Curing Compositions </PAC><PAR>  The present room temperature curing composition is obtained as a one-can      room temperature curing composition by uniformly mixing the above      components in a dry atmosphere. Also, the component (A) and the component      (B) may be separately packaged to make the composition into a two-pack      type thereby allowing them to be mixed when needed. </PAR><PAR>  When the present composition is exposed to air, the crosslinking reaction      proceeds by the moisture in the air and cures to form an elastomeric body.      The elastomeric body is high in rubber strength and excellent in chemical      resistance. </PAR><PAR>  The present composition is useful as a sealing material and a coating      material in building and civil engineering industries, also as an adhesive      and a sealing material for electric and electronic parts, and as an FIPG      material in automobile industry and also useful for a gas separating      membrane represented by an oxygen enrichment membrane. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLES </PAC><PAR>  Now the present invention will be described with reference to Examples,      wherein all the parts quoted represent parts by weight and all of the      values of the viscosity were obtained at 25.degree.

After allowing      them to stand for 16 hours at room temperature, all of them cured to      transparent elastomeric bodies. </PAR><PAR>  They were further allowed to cure for maturing for 2 days at room      temperature and physical properties of the cured products were measured in      accordance with JIS K-6301.
