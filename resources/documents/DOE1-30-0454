<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-0454 </DOCNO><TEXT>During the past several years, a program of high-frequency radiowave studiesof the high-latitude ionosphere has been developed. Studies are now beingconducted on the formation and motion of high-latitude ionospheric electrondensity irregularities, using a sophisticated high-frequency radar systeminstalled at Goose Bay, Labrador. The radar antenna is also being usedto receive signals from a beacon transmitter located at Thule, Greenland.This information is providing a better understanding of the spatial andtemporal variability of high-latitude propagation channels and theirrelationship to disturbances in the magnetosphere/ionosphere system.</TEXT></DOC>
