When the races were held on weekdays, I taped them on my VCR. I was thrilled by the prospect of 44-year-old Dennis Conner, who in 1983 had lost the cup (the only loss in 132 years), recapturing it and bringing it back home.    When Stars andamp; Stripes rounded the first buoy well ahead in the first race of the final series, I felt the kind of pride I generally associate when I watch American teams participate in the Olympics. But by the time Mr. Conner captured the series 40, I couldn't avoid the feeling that there was a certain unfairness to it all.    Kookaburra III and Stars andamp; Stripes both represented multimillion-dollar syndicates and years of planning for a shot at the cup. Already, Kookaburra officials are talking about a $35 million venture aimed at bringing the cup back to Australia in 1990.    Mr. Conner's crewmen were mostly amateurs, while Kookaburra's were well-paid professionals. But most of the money went into design and technology. For Stars andamp; Stripes, the process began three years ago when three of America's best designers collaborated to create the fastest 12-meter boat. Their design combined a raised bow, a keel and rudder change, and a plastic hull coating. In 1983, the Australians won the cup largely because of an innovation of their own: the winged keel. This time, both boats had winged keels. Next time, all competing boats probably will have plastic hull coatings. And so on, and on.    The disproportionate role of technology is overwhelming athletic competition. Even though Dennis Conner was clearly the superior sailor, both against Kookaburra III and against New Zealand's boat, Kiwi Magic, in the semifinals, technology was the real champ of the America's Cup. Mr. Conner and his crew probably would have won had the only criteria been sailing skill and physical endurance; if so, it would have made for a more satisfying result. But as it is, we will never know.    True sport -- and sailboat racing is very definitely a sport -- relies on skill and endurance to produce a winner. With that in mind, technology should be shared evenly by all competitors; the human factor should take priority.    Consider, for example, the idea of a pole-vaulter with a superior pole, unavailable to anyone else, or a baseball team with bats that propel the ball farther than conventional bats. Professional golf has barred the use of clubs that provide an unfair advantage, and those of us who are Redskin fans will remember the heated debates over the composition of Mark Mosley's square-toed kicking shoe, which proved, notwithstanding Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry's claims to the contrary, to be fully within football regulations.    Twelve-meter racing, though, seems to be immune from these considerations. Down under, the only thing that was established for certain was that American technology, when put to the test, is superior to that of the Aussies. That's a comforting thought, but somehow it's just not enough.    ---   Mr. Boyd lives in Alexandria, Va.
