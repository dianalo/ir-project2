<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-36-0751 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple procedure using point sources is described for the calibrationof portable high-resolution gamma-ray detectors used in field surveys.The point source data are fitted by empirical equations that are usedto calculate efficiency for field applications. Two models for the distributionof radionuclides are treated: a thin surface-film model and a verticallyhomogeneous model. The success of the procedure has been demonstratedby field applications in plots where the levels of contamination areknown.</TEXT></DOC>
