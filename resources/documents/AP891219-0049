Unconfirmed reports have put the death toll at up to 400 and onewitness was quoted as saying he saw helicopters fire on crowds inthe city of Timisoara.   Romania has virtually sealed its borders in an apparent attemptto prevent details from emerging of the unrest, which a Hungariannewspaper said had spread to two other Transylvanian cities _ Aradand Brasov.   The unrest is the most serious since November 1987 in thecountry whose leaders have refused to stray from orthodox Communism.   State-controlled Romanian media have made no mention of theunrest, and Western reporters have been prevented from entering thecountry. Most reports have come from travelers leaving Romania orfrom news agencies able to reach residents by telephone.   In Timisoara beginning on Saturday, thousands of people haveviolently vented rage at hard-line President Nicolae Ceausescu forhis intolerance and the hardships he has forced Romanians to endure.   Greek dental students, who had been attending school in thecity, said late Monday after crossing into Yugoslavia that they hadseen soldiers shoot indiscriminately at protesters, ``killingdozens.''   The students said they heard protesters shout ``Freedom!''``Down with Ceausescu!'' and ``Bread!''   A Western resident of Timisoara who crossed into Yugoslavia toldThe Associated Press that the extent of the weekend violence was``horrifying'' and that he saw several corpses on the streets.   ``Tiananmen is nothing compared to Timisoara,'' he said,speaking on condition he not be further identified. At least 500people were killed in June when Chinese troops crushed thepro-democracy movement in Beijing.   Budapest radio said a caller from Timisoara _ 30 miles from theHungarian and Yugoslav borders _ this morning reported renewedgunfire but that the phone then went dead.   The radio quoted a Hungarian who said he had several physicianrelatives working in Timisoara hospitals. He said he talked to themby telephone and estimated from their reports that between 300 and400 people were killed in the city by troops, with 250 bodies takento one hospital.   About 20 percent of the dead and wounded were ethnic Hungarians,others ethnic Romanians, he told the radio.   That would substantiate other accounts trickling out of thecountry that the protest grew from a few hundred ethnic Hungariansdefending a local pastor into a massive demonstration againstCeausescu's harsh policies.   Romania's crackdown drew protest from other countries includingHungary, which has long been at odds with Bucharest over thetreatment of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarian minority in Romania,most of whom live in Transylvania.   A Yugoslav who said he traveled to Timisoara Saturday night wasquoted as telling the Belgrade daily Politika that crowds in thecity were fired on from helicopters.   ``I was stopped at approach to Timisoara by soldiers, holdingguns at point-blank range, but they let me through,'' RadoslavDencic was quoted by the daily as saying.   ``The same night bursts of automatic weapon fire could beheard,'' he said. ``Crowds were even shot at from helicopters.''   A Yugoslav trucker, Frank Zemberi, said he passed throughTimisoara early Tuesday and saw two large fires raging in distantparts of town.   ``Countless'' tanks were parked on the outskirts of Timisoara,Zemberi said, but the city itself appeared calm, with five armoredvehicles parked in the center and a number of police vans cruisingthe streets.   A Yugoslav traveler said Monday he saw two people killed inTimisoara. Traffic into Romania was virtually halted on theYugoslav, Hungarian and Bulgarian borders, and Austrians and WestGermans were informed that, with few exceptions, they were notallowed to enter.   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Monda that security forceshad taken full control in Timisoara, Romania's fourth-largest citywith 350,000 residents.   Hungary's Radio Kossuth quoted an unnamed resident of the cityas saying things were calm during the day, ``but at night it's likeduring the war.   ``All main intersections have roadblocks, everybody is stoppedand checked and people are not allowed to leave town except inextreme cases,'' the radio quoted the resident as saying.   The Hungarian daily Magyar Hirlap today quoted unidentifiedtruck drivers as saying Arad, some 60 miles north of Timisoara,``is ringed with tanks and traffic is detoured.'' It assertedwithout any specifics that there were also clashes in Arad andBrasov.   Col. Janos Pal of the Hungarian border guards was quoted assaying crowds in Curtic, between Arad and Timisoara, broke intolocal Communist Party headquarters on Sunday and burned documents.   In a broadcast Monday on West Germany's Radio Bremen, WilliamToetoek, an ethnic German writer from Romania, quoted witnesses inTimisoara as saying between 300 and 400 demonstrators were killedin the unrest.   The bloody clashes were a sign of contempt for Ceausescu, whohas ruled Romania since 1965, stifling dissent with a vast secretpolice force and stubbornly resisting reform.   While other East bloc countries end or relax one-party Communistrule, Ceausescu's government has maintained strict control ofsociety and the economy and continues to harass and jail itscritics.   Ceausescu's crash industrialization programs and drive to repaythe country's entire $11 billion foreign debt have causedwidespread shortages and rationing of basic foods.   The unrest was the most serious since a protest march by 10,000workers in Brasov in November 1987. Ceausescu did not comment on itand on Monday traveled to Iran for a state visit. His his wife,Elena, the second most powerful person in the country, stayedbehind.   The unrest apparently began after hundreds of members of thecountry's ethnic Hungarian minority formed a ``human chain'' Fridayto prevent the attempted eviction of the Rev. Laszlo Toekes, whohas championed their rights, said Mihnea Berindei, vice chairman ofthe Paris-based Romanian League for Human Rights.   The Protestant clergyman, harassed for months by authorities fordefending ethnic Hungarians against alleged officialdiscrimination, took refuge with his wife in his church on Nov. 2after masked assailants tried to attack him, Berindei said. He saidToekes' whereabouts were not known Monday evening.</TEXT></DOC>
