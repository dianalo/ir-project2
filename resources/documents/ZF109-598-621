(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Rhys, David; Richards, Marcus; Tollet, Andrew; Stanley, D.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>LETTERS Your dBase IV review (in issue 140) was the most amusing thing I'veread for yonks.andP;  Don't get me wrong -- it was a fine review, although I wishthat magazines would review supposedly 'relational' databases against Codd'srules -- not just giving a score (such as &quot;4 out of 12, average&quot;) butproviding a proper discussion of the issues.andM;No, it was the beautifully deadpan reporting of the discovery of structuredtechniques and their relation to defect-free development that I liked.andO;Heaven knows, I've met people in the mainframe world that see the structuredtechniques as a &quot;new, untried, approach&quot; but when the structured testing ofmodules appears as an innovation, I really begin to despair!andM;I suppose that it confirms my prejudices.andP;  PC (MS-DOS) software developmentis about where mainframe development was back when the IBM 360 started -- andfor similar reasons (paramount importance of response time and executablesize in a physically limited environment).andP;  PC software got away with it whenapplications weren't demanding and everything was single-user andsingle-tasking.andM;Now that software is multi-user (on LANs) or even multi-tasking as well(Windows 3.0, OS/2) there's no room for 'unprofessional' practice.andO;Businesses are beginning to rely on their LAN systems in place of mainframes-- I suggest that any PC software developer who wishes to stay employed hadbetter learn about structured techniques (or even formal methods) prettysoon.andM;David Rhys Address suppliedandM;Peter Jackson replies: you have a fair point; Ashton-Tate's implementation ofa rigorous development and testing environment for dBase IV 1.1 was overdue.andO;And to be fair, the review did say that the regime now in place was &quot;gooddevelopment practice&quot; and that its lack had contributed to the problems ofdBase IV 1.0.andM;However, one of the major problems for PC software developers in buildinglarge and complex packages is a historical one.andP;  Most of the softwareindustry standards in the PC world were developed by one or two peopleproducing the whole package from the ground up.andM;Lotus 1-2-3, dBase II and WordPerfect were all written in this way, forexample.andP;  But that's no longer possible given the complexity of today'spackages: nowadays, it's common for development teams to be separatedfunctionally -- with one group working on printer drivers, one on screenhandling, and so on -- and geographically, across several cities or states.andO;The team might also be split across several companies, as is the most famouscase with Microsoft and IBM sharing OS/2 development.andM;Controlling such a divided development effort is something new for PCsoftware companies, and bolting together the products of different teams withdifferent programming styles, even if the modular interfaces arewell-defined, can have unpredictable results on the performance or size of tefinal package.andP;  Then any required changes to the code again have to be brokendown and farmed out to the separate teams.andM;You're right to say that structured methods, and perhaps even formal methods,are needed to stop these ad hoc development efforts running into the mire.andO;As Ashton-Tate has proved, the PC industry's enduring informality will causemajor problems unless it can be tamed.andM;CAPTION CONVERSATIONandM;With reference to the photograph of dBase IV in Letters, issue 142, I'd liketo make the following points regarding your caption: &quot;dBase IV 1.1: inferiorto SQL when retrieving data in the server environment&quot;.andM;First, SQL is a fully integrated component of dBase IV version 1.1.andP;  Thesyntax of the language allows SQL statements to be embedded in dBaseprograms, as is common with many other procedural languages and 4GLs.andP;  SQLstatements can also be composed and issued from the dot prompt for immediateexecution.andM;The connection to the server environment to which you refer will be madeavailable with the dBase IV Server Edition, which has entered beta testingthis week.andP;  This product will provide access to remote SQL databases in atrue client/server architecture.andM;I hope this clarifies the confusion in your letters page over the place ofSQL in the dBase product.andM;Dr Marcus Richards dBase Product Manager Ashton-TateandM;FROM 7 TO 700andM;I had to laugh when I read the story in issue 143 about IBM and its gang of700.andP;  People in the mainframe world will remember IBM and the Seven Dwarvesand this 'initiative' seems to be simply a re-run of that.andP;  After threeyears, IBM has finally woken up to the fact that it needs to make MicroChannel a genuinely open standard that interested parties can cleave to --and make money from.andP;  Maybe soon the best-selling PS/2 won't be an ATanymore.andM;I've got no financial interest in which architecture wins -- EISA or MCA --but at least now IBM has come clean and recognised that it can't doeverything on its own.andP;  That's got to be be for the better of everyone.andM;D Ringer London NW1andM;GOING SOLOandM;May I think you for the 'Excellent' review given to our company in yourcurrent issue.andM;We'd appreciate it if you'd advise your readers of just one fact.andP;  Betweenthe time of our reviewed course and publication of your review we've changedour policy: we'll now run the course even if there's only one participant atno additional charge.andM;This, we hope you'll agree, makes our courses -- which you reviewed as'Excellent' -- even better value for money.andM;Andrew Tollet Managing Director ABT UpminsterandM;AMSTRADS OLD AND NEWandM;I recenlty read your report on the new Amstrad 3000 series.andP;  It was more thana little critical of the PC2386 compared with the PC3386 SX.andP;  I own a PC2386and have little complaint with regard to speed.andM;After undergoing some maintenance from Dictaphone (because of intermittentboot failures), I now have the current version of the main PCB board and thelatest specification of the Seagate ST277R -- the ST277R-1 (this latest modelis rated at 28ms access time, determined as 29.16ms under SpinRite).andM;Both replacements make a good deal of difference in terms of performance, andthe former (according to the engineer) improves hardware compatibility.andM;In terms of expansion, it's harder to install any more disk drives because ofthe lack of the necessary bays within a 2386, and of course to service it, itmust be totally disassembled (but that's Dictaphone's problem).andP;  Theexpansion slots, in my opinion, would have been better off at the back of themachine, like on the SX version.andM;On the other hand, a major drawback of the SX is the processor daughterboardwhich, as you point out, won't allow adequate heat dissipation (a fault noshared by the 2386).andP;  Also the IDE controller -- which, the engineer tellsme, is cached -- will cause problems with the major hard disk utilities, andnecessitate removal of the case to disable the cache (if this is possible).andM;But in terms of performance, my 2386 and SX are probably well matched, andslightly weighted in favour of my DX.andM;A current production model of the PC2386 should have been used to make acomparison with the new PC3386 SX model.andM;D Stanley Worthing West Sussex</TEXT></DOC>
