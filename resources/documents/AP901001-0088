The Frenchmen were among hundreds of Westerners believed held atkey military and other installations Saddam fears might be attackedby the West.   It was the second gesture by Iraq toward France in as many days.On Sunday, Saddam complimented French President Francois Mitterrandfor offering ``positive'' ideas to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis.   The Iraqi agency, monitored in Nicosia said: ``President SaddamHussein has issued orders to allow some French guests to leave Iraqin the company of Mr. Gilles Munier, the president of theAssociation of Franco-Iraqi Friendship.''   INA, the report added, ``has learned that nine Frenchmen areincluded in this humanitarian gesture.''   Foreigners, mainly Westerners, were banned from traveling afterthe Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent annexationof the oil-rich emirate.   As of late last month, 4,200 Westerners remained in Iraq andKuwait, including an undetermined number being held at Iraqimilitary installations.   In Sunday's message, Saddam softened his confrontational standin the gulf crisis, calling for replacing the language of ``threatsand warnings'' with a dialogue. However, he again linked anysolution to an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories.   The United States has rejected that proposal, insisting on anunconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.   But Mitterrand, in a speech before the U.N. General Assemblylast week, stressed the need to resolve other issues, although hedemanded an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.   He also suggested a simultaneous withdrawal of the Iraqis fromKuwait and the U.S.-led multinational force from Saudi Arabia.   In his message to Arabs and Moslems released by the officialmedia on Sunday, Saddam said he intended to initiate contact withParis. He said Mitterrand's ``initiative'' could be developed toserve as a foundation for a settlement in the gulf.   But Britain and France responded that there would be no dialoguewith Iraq until Saddam's troops are out of Kuwait.   The Frenchmen to be released were identified by INA as: BoubanJean Ive, Frank Ouzeau, Gerard Wisat, Laurant Lucal, ChristopheCorrisier, Akbar Ali Ramadan, Din Mahmoud Taki, Hassan Ali MansourHusseun, and Dorneau Michel Henry Paul. The names weretransliterated from Arabic.</TEXT></DOC>
