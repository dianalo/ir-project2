Korean newspapers, quoting government sources, said theSouth Korean government selected GE, based in Fairfield,Conn., over British Aerospace PLC of Britain as the mainmanufacturer of a telecommunications satellite to be launchedin 1995.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman for GE Aerospace, the Valley Forge, Pa., unitthat competed for the business, said the company had not beennotified that a contract had been awarded but was optimisticabout its chances.   Notification is expected by the beginning of this week,spokesman Jim Tierney said.   South Korean officials were not available for comment.   The reports said GE was favored over British Aerospacebecause of the U.S. firm's cheaper bid price, its experiencewith broadcasting satellites and its willingness to transfertechnology to South Korean companies.   GE has launched about 35 commercial satellites since 1975for both domestic and overseas customers.   Mr. Tierney said that if GE won the contract, it wouldmanufacture the satellite at GE Aerospace's Astro-Spacedivision in East Windsor, N.J.   GE would not hire additional workers for the project butwould instead use the plant's existing work force, which isbeing pared to about 2,500 from 3,100 as part of acompanywide restructuring.</TEXT></DOC>
