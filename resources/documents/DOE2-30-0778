<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0778 </DOCNO><TEXT>The investigation of stimulated emission causing transitions from theB(1) pi sub u state of sodium to the overlapping 2(1) sigma(+) sub gelectronic state has been continued. A new method of estimating the Franck-Condonfactors has been developed which instead of fitting the molecular potentialcurves with Morse functions, estimates the V(r) dependence by interpolationfrom given potential curves. The results for the sum of the rates fromone vibrational level in the upper state to all the levels in the lowerstate show good agreement with the previous method, implying that curvecrossing by stimulated emission due to photons from the oven is an importantmechanism in sodium.</TEXT></DOC>
