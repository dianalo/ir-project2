The fighting came a day after the Christian forces of Gen.Michel Aoun repelled a ground attack on Souk el-Garb, a mountainstronghold outside Beirut. It was the first ground assault in fivemonths of fierce artillery and rocket exchanges between Christianforces and Syrian troops allied with Druse militias.   Police reported three people killed and 12 wounded in today'srenewed shelling exchanges between Aoun's forces and the Syrianarmy.   The new casualties raised the overall death toll since fightingbroke out March 8 to 736 killed and 1,896 wounded by police count.At least 37 civilians were killed and 120 wounded during shellingbetween midnight Saturday and midnight Sunday.   Police said the hilltop presidential palace, where Aoun has anunderground headquarters bunker, was repeatedly hit today by Syrianmortar and rocket fire. But a police spokesman said there were nocasualties and that Aoun and his aides were safe.   The spokesman, who cannot be identified in keeping withregulations, said the Syrians were massing troops and armor in acentral mountain near Douar, 11 miles northeast of Souk el-Gharb.   ``They're bringing in T-62 tanks and dozens of mortars ofvarious calibers to positions overlooking Douar,'' he said.   Douar is a major Christian military position beside the mainroad through the mountains from the Syrian-held Bekaa Valley ineast Lebanon.   Today's movements triggered fears the Syrians were planning anew attempt to punch into the Christian enclave.   Souk el-Gharb, which lies 15 miles southeast of Beirut, wasagain hit by Syrian shellfire today.   Police said 25 Syrians, 20 Druse militiamen and 25 Palestinianswere killed Sunday in the Souk el-Gharb fighting and in skirmishesalong Beirut's dividing Green Line. The Lebanese Army said four ofits men were killed and six wounded. They were no immediate reportsof casualties today.   Aoun's aides said his forces were bracing for another assault.   ``We're ready to take them on again,'' an Aoun aide said asmortar and tank fire hit the town, abandoned by civilians six yearsago.   The mountaintop garrison, under siege by Syrian-backed Moslemforces since 1983, controls a network of roads that twist throughLebanon's central range into the Christian heartland.   If Souk el-Gharb fell, it would leave the way open for a Syrianground offensive into the beleaguered Christian sector.   Aoun said his U.S.-trained 8th Brigade, reinforced by the 10thCommando Brigade, repulsed a four-pronged attack on Souk el-GharbSunday by 2,100 Syrian regulars, Palestinian guerrillas of theradical Syrian-backed Fatah-Uprising faction and the DruseProgressive Socialist Party militia.   Aoun, the army commander and leader of a Christian Cabinet,controls an estimated 20,000 troops opposed by about 40,000 Syrianregulars and their Moslem militia allies. Aoun is also backed bythe 6,000-member right-wing Lebanese Forces, the main Chrisitanmilitia.   The recent fighting is the latest round in a 14-year-old civilwar.   Today's bombardment began sporadically around dawn andintensified by midday into sustained barrages on Christian eastBeirut and north along the coast. Aoun's artillery retaliated byopening up on Syrian gun positions in west Beirut.   A Syrian militiary spokesman in Damascus denied that any Syrianforces were involved in Sunday's fighting at Souk el-Gharb.   Syria's military headquarters in Lebanon said in a statementthat ``nationalist forces'' allies to Syria mounted the assault.   The Druse party claimed its men staged a ``hit-and-run attack''on the Christian base.   But Aoun's headquarters said the Syrians threw most of their41st Brigade into the combined assault with the Moslem irregulars.   ``They suffered a resounding defeat,'' Aoun said in a victoryspeech broadcast by Christian radio stations Sunday.   Both sides have been locked in heavy artillery duels sinceThursday, firing hundreds of thousands of shells and rockets thathave devastated much of Beirut.   Rescue teams used an overnight lull to remove civilians trappedin wrecked buildings. Hundreds of cars smoldered in streetslittered with broken glass and rubble. The acrid smoke from scoresof apartment buildings that burned all night wafted through thealleyways.   Dazed residents cautiously emerged from their shelters aftersome had been underground for four days. Long lines formed outsidethe few bakeries that opened. Sandbagged supermarkets were crowded.   An estimated 85 percent of Beirut's 1.5 million people have fledin recent weeks as the fighting intensified.   Syria's troops are in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate. Aoun maintains they betrayed that mandatewhen they sided the Moslems in the war.   Syria refuses to negotiate with Aoun, who has vowed to drive theSyrians out of Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
