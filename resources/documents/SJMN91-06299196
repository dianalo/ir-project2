The line blocks harder forhim because of who he is.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DEFENSE WARY OF MCMAHON  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  49ers Notebook  </MEMO><TEXT>     McMahon sprained his right knee against Washington on Sept. 30. The offensehasn't scored a touchdown since, and the Eagles have lost all three gamesMcMahon has been out.;   McMahon will play with a brace on his right knee,which will probably hamper his mobility. The 49ers defensive linemen hope itdoes. They haven't had a sack for two straight games.; ETC.: Seifert said hethought defensive end Pierce Holt, who has a ligament strain in his rightknee, would miss the next two games but that he didn't think surgery was apossibility. Seifert also said it was doubtful that Kevin Fagan, MichaelWalter or Brent Jones would play this week.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN KILLION, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911025  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  169  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 25, 199100299196,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
