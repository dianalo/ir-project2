Under sections 311 and 312, facilities required toprepare or have available a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for hazardouschemicals under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and its implementingregulations must submit the MSDS (or a list of the hazardous chemicals)and inventory forms to the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC),Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.On August 4, 1988, EPA published a notice which clarifies the reportingdates for facilities in the non-manufacturing sector which were coveredby the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazard CommunicationStandard as of June 24, 1988. This notice clarifies the reporting datesfor facilities in the construction industry which were covered by the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standardas of January 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>1.

For allestablishments except those in the construction industry, OSHA's August1987 revised HCS rule became effective on June 24, 1988. On that same date,the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stayed the applicationof the revised HCS rule to the construction industry at the request ofconstruction industry representatives. After considering the merits ofthe construction industry challenge to the revised HCS rule, however, theThird Circuit vacated the stay. This ruling became fully effective on January30, 1989. In a recently published <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (54 FR 6886, Feb. 15, 1989), OSHA announcedthat all provisions of the revised HCS rule were in effect in all segmentsof industry as of January 30, 1989.Sections 311 and 312 of Title III of SARA apply to the owner or operatorof any facility which is required to prepare or have available a materialsafety data sheet (MSDS) for a hazardous chemical under the OSHA HCS. Section311 of Title III requires that owners and operators submit an MSDS foreach hazardous chemical at or above threshold amounts at the facility ora list of such chemicals to the SERC, LEPC and local fire department. Section311(d)(1)(B) of Title III requires that the initial MSDS or list submissionbe made three months after the owner or operator of a facility is requiredto prepare or have available an MSDS for the chemical under the OSHA HCS.Therefore, EPA is today clarifying that the date established for section311 compliance for the construction industry, newly subject to the HCSas of January 30, 1989, is April 30, 1989. Section 312 requires that thesame facilities subject to section 311 submit an inventory form containingTier I information annually on March 1 to the SERC, LEPC and local firedepartment. Thus, EPA is today clarifying that employers in the constructionindustry must submit their first Tier I inventory reports to these stateand local entities by March 1, 1990.Regulations for compliance with sections 311 and 312 of Title III werepromulgated on October 15, 1987 (52 FR 38344) and codified at 40 CFR Part370. This final regulation established the minimum threshold quantitiesapplicable to the reporting requirements of all facilities subject to OSHA'sMSDS requirements under sections 311 and 312, including facilities newlysubject to the requirements at a future date.The threshold for the first two years of reporting was set in the Agency'sOctober 1987 regulation at 10,000 pounds, except for extremely hazardoussubstances (EHS). EHS must be reported if present in quantities at or abovetheir chemical-specific threshold planning quantities or 500 pounds, whicheveris less. EPA plans to propose a third-year and permanent threshold forreporting under sections 311 and 312 in the near future.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 370</ITAG>Community Right-to-Know, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act,Hazard communication, Material safety data sheets.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan Z.
