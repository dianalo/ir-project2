Here is a report from a correspondent who has coveredAfghanistan from his base in neighboring Pakistan.</TEXT><BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the Soviet military withdrawalfrom Afghanistan, a new chapter begins for the war-ravaged country.Like the previous one, it too may be written in blood.   For with the Soviets gone, the division between Afghan Marxismand Islam, the predominant religion, becomes even sharper and theprospect of even bloodier fighting is heightened.   On the sidelines in Pakistan and Iran are more than 5 millionAfghan war refugees waiting to go back home in what will be thelargest mass movement of people since World War II.   Afghans of all persuasions agree that 10 years of civil war, thepast eight with Soviet involvement, have changed their countryforever.   Leaders of the Moslem insurgent groups based at Peshawar inPakistan have vowed to continue fighting until they topple theMarxist government in Kabul, the capital, and proclaim Afghanistanan Islamic republic.   The Afghan communists appear confident they can hold their owneven with the Soviet military departed. While Soviet armed might isleaving, Moscow's influence remains strong in the capital of thenation that sits strategically at the Soviet Union's southernunderbelly.   In a curious accord signed this spring in Geneva, the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union agreed to continue arming theirrespective clients until either side stops.   The April 14 agreement set the guidelines for some 103,000Soviet troops to withdraw from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989. Thepullout began this past May 15.   Pakistan, which has served as conduit for mainly U.S. arms tothe guerrillas, pledged with Kabul not to interfere in each other'saffairs but to work for the safe return of the Afghan refugees nowin Pakistan and Iran.   ``The Geneva accord is not a peace accord in the real sense butit gives the Soviet Union a face-saving pretext to end itsinvolvement in the war,'' said a Pakistani Foreign Ministryspokesman, following the custom here that spokesmen remainanonymous. ``The rest is up to the Afghans themselves.''   The Afghan people are a tapestry of tribes and clans accustomedto running their own affairs before the Marxist People's DemocraticParty of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup in April,1978.   It sparked a broad rebellion by devout Moslems, tribal warlordsand merchants.   Soviet troops, aircraft and armor came in December 1979 with thereplacement of one pro-Moscow regime with another. The Sovietseventually learned at a price what the United States also learnedin Vietnam: that even a superpower army is ill suited to fight adetermined guerrilla war.   Eight years of experience and growing arms supplies from theUnited States, China and Saudi Arabia have whipped the so-calledIslamic rebels into an effective fighting force. They have learnedto operate U.S. Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and othersophisticated weapons.   The guerrillas, known as the mujahedeen (holy warriors), alreadyhave scored a series of successes since the Soviet Red Army startedits march home. The victories came mainly in the border regions ofeastern Afghanistan where Kabul's security forces were left behind.   However, for a full victory the guerrillas would need to captureKabul and the Afghan capital is a fortress of Soviet-builtdefenses. It would be a difficult task for the guerrillas to seizeit and overthrow the government, leaving them only with therecourse of seeking a political, rather than military, victory.   Najib, who uses one name as president of Afghanistan and head ofthe ruling party, refuses to discuss the possibility of his defeat.   Asked recently whether he would seek refugee abroad if theguerrillas take over, the burly former chief of secret police said:``We shall not allow such a thing.''   Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad say, however, theirmissions in Kabul have received reports of major construction underway at Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of northern Balkh province just36 miles from the Soviet border.   ``New intensive construction activity sponsored by the (ruling)party has lent some credence to claims the PDPA might attempt toestablish a fallback position in the north should it be unable tohold Kabul,'' said one Western embassy in a background reportissued on condition that its country remain anonymous.   At the same time, most foreign analysts who keep watch onAfghanistan predict the absence of the Soviets will unleash anarmed power struggle within the ranks of each of the opposing sides.   Najib's own party, for example, is bitterly split between hisParcham (Banner) wing and the Khalq (Masses) faction whichdominates the police and military. Even the Parchamites are dividedbetween Najib supporters and those of former leader Babrak Karmal,whom Najib replaced in May 1986 ostensibly for health reasons.   In Peshawar, the seven major mujahedeen parties are themselvessplit between Moslem revolutionaries and moderate traditionalists.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
