WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Poverty in America's cities has grown morepersistent and concentrated over the last two decades and itsvictims have less chance of escape, according to a report by theNational League of Cities.   The study describes a changing face of poverty since 1970, withthe nation's poor more likely now to live in metropolitan areas andconcentrate in low-income neighborhoods.   It said the proportion of children living in poverty hasincreased and the likelihood of people climbing above the povertylevel has declined.   ``Poverty in cities is changing in quality and intensity,'' thereport said. ``It is more persistent among particular households,more concentrated within particular neighborhoods, and more isolatedfrom traditional avenues of escape.''   The league released its report, ``Poverty in Cities,'' as nearly3,000 municipal leaders gathered in Washington for theorganization's annual winter meeting, which runs through Tuesday.   ``Both the figures and the trends are alarming,'' Alan Beals,executive director of the National League of Cities, said inreleasing the report. ``Such conditions are devastating for thosecaught up in it, especially children.''   The report, an analysis and compilation of previous research,said poverty in America declined through much of the 1970s, to arate of under 12 percent at the end of the decade. But a resurgencebrought the rate to more than 15 percent by 1985, and the averagerate for the years 1980 through 1987 was over 14 percent, the leaguesaid.   The portion of the nation's poor living in metropolitan areasgrew from 62 percent in 1979 to 70 percent in 1985 _ an increase of7.6 million people, with the majority living in central cities, itsaid.   The report said the persistence of poverty _ that is, the lengthof time a person remains poor _ has grown. It cited previous studiesof the proportion of urban poor in a given year who escaped povertythe following year and said in the late 1960s, that figure was 32out of 100.   Called the ``escape probability,'' the figure rose to 37 out of100 in the mid-1970s, meaning that poverty became less persistent,but began declining and was 23 out of 100 by the early 1980s.   ``There has been a substantial decrease in the chances that apoor person will escape poverty within the following year,'' it said.   An increase was also recorded in the proportion of poor residentsof big cities who live in neighborhoods that are classified asextremely poor _ where at least 40 percent of residents live belowthe poverty line. Among the 50 largest cities, theconcentration-of-poverty rate increased from 16 percent in 1970 to24 percent in 1980 _ meaning nearly one-quarter of the large-citypoor lived in extremely poor neighborhoods.   The report said poor neighborhoods of large central cities havebecome increasingly isolated from the rest of the metropolitanareas, with more clear differences in socioeconomic and physicalconditions.   As more ghetto dwellers live in more isolated deprivation, theiropportunities for jobs, training and other means of climbing out ofpoverty are reduced, it said.   The study said blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whitesto live in extremely poor neighborhoods, and poverty among blackswas more persistent than for other groups. More than 21 percent ofblacks living in big cities were persistently poor throughout the 10years between 1974 and 1983, it said, compared to a rate of lessthan 3 percent for non-blacks.   The poverty rate among children, it said, grew from 16 percent in1979 to over 20 percent in 1985, which it called ``a startlingincrease.''   The report was written by Mark Alan Hughes, assistant professorat Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. </TEXT></DOC>
