The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, in an announcement yesterday, said only that it had decided to review the contracts. Officials said the review was prompted by complaints from China.    MITI imposed the one-year ban last May, following the disclosure that Toshiba Machine sold sophisticated milling equipment to the Soviet Union in violation of Western-bloc rules governing exports to communist countries. The U.S. charged that the Soviets used the machines to manufacture quieter submarine propellers, making detection more difficult.    The ban kept Toshiba Machine from fulfilling 25 contracts, valued at about 2.4 billion yen ($18 million), that it had concluded with China before MITI acted. China complained that the Japanese action made it difficult to carry out some industrial projects.    MITI officials said the controversy involving 18 of the contracts already has been settled by asking other companies to supply the products, postponing delivery dates or cancelling some of the contracts altogether. However, Japan and China have failed to reach agreement on the remaining seven contracts, valued at about 1.1 billion yen.    These MITI officials said they may allow Toshiba Machine to resume exports based on the seven contracts if it's found that the resumption wouldn't run counter to the agreement among major non-communist nations governing exports to communist countries. But even if the government decides to allow Toshiba Machine to resume exports, the officials said, it would freeze payments to the company until the ban expires next May 20.    ---   Outlook for Manufacturers   Special to The Wall Street Journal    TOKYO -- Major Japanese manufacturers expect business to improve sharply because of growing domestic demand, a Bank of Japan survey found.    Officials said the quarterly survey was the first taken since the yen began to surge in late 1985 in which a majority of managers at big manufacturers said they expected an increase in sales and earnings. The survey covered 6,953 companies in manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries.    The report was the latest in a series of indications that Japan has recovered from the slump caused by the strong yen. Last Friday, the government said that the economy grew at a robust 8.4% annual rate in the quarter ended Sept. 30, driven by domestic demand.    The report was due to be officially released yesterday morning. On Monday, it was distributed to some news organizations and government agencies, and it apparently was leaked to several Tokyo banks and securities companies.    ---   Southeast Asian Aid Plan   Special to The Wall Street Journal    TOKYO -- Japan's new $2 billion aid package for Southeast Asian nations will emphasize private-industry projects, shifting from the past focus on big government ventures, officials said.    Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita plans to disclose details of the package next week on a visit to the Philippines that coincides with a meeting of the six heads of state from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.    The former prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, pledged the aid before he stepped down in October, and government ministries have been drafting details. The $2 billion in aid, part of a $20 billion program to &quot;recycle&quot; Japan's huge trade surplus, includes a new private investment fund as well as development loans to spur export industries, according to Foreign Ministry officials. </TEXT></DOC>
