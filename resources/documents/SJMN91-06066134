Dolomite, unlike limestone, expands as it dries.;    Threetruckloads of the contaminated load were poured into the jail constructionsite in downtown Oakland.;    Half-dollar sized bubbles formed and beganpopping off.;    Work at the jail screeched to a halt while crews waterblasted off the defective concrete. It took eight months.;    While KaiserCement paid for the repairs and a new load of concrete, Alameda County sued,seeking compensation for the delay.;    Richard Sangster, an attorneyrepresenting the Walnut Creek-based firm, said Kaiser Cement agreed to pay thecounty $500,000 for expenses involved in sending prisoners to and from itsSanta Rita Jail in Dublin. But he said the county wanted $2 million more,claiming a loss of use of its jail.;    The case was heard in Contra CostaCounty Superior Court. Ultimately, it went to the state Court of Appeal, whichruled that another trial should be held.;    Rather than going to the extratime and expense, both sides agreed to the settlement. The agreement wasapproved Tuesday by the county's board of supervisors. Sangster said itrepresents Kaiser's original $500,000 offer plus interest.;    The agreement,according to Carl Pagter, general counsel for Kaiser Cement, represents thelast in a string of lawsuits stemming from the delivery of faulty concrete tomore than 100 construction sites throughout the Bay Area.;    &quot;It was an errorwe think can't be repeated,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ABBY COHN, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910306  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  370  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 6, 199100066134,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
