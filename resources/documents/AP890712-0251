The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday filed a civilcomplaint alleging that former Merrill Lynch broker William J.Dillon passed on market-sensitive information from the leadingbusiness weekly to his mother and others.   Dillon already has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud inthe case and was sentenced in April to six months in prison.   But none of the other four people named Tuesday has beenpreviously charged, and the civil lawsuit includes unnamed brokers,investors and a bank who also allegedly profited from advanceknowledge of the magazine's ``Inside Wall Street'' column.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, head of securities andcommodities fraud, said a criminal investigation in the case remainsopen in New York and Connecticut. But he would not disclose whetherfurther criminal indictments were planned.   Prosecutors, though, last year agreed not to pursue criminalcharges against Dillon's mother, Elizabeth Baird, who was named inthe civil action Tuesday filed in U.S. District Court in New Haven.   The lawsuit seeks more than $865,000 in alleged illicit profitsfrom the defendants and up to three times that amount in penaltiesfor a potential total of $3.46 million.   It charges that Dillon paid $20 or $30 a week regularly for twoyears to get copies of Business Week and then tipped off friendsabout hot stocks for trading.   According to the suit, Dillon, while working as a broker atMerrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s New London, Conn., office, illegally obtainedcopies of the magazine from March 1986 to July 1988.   The lawsuit mentions but does not name others who allegedlytraded on the information supplied by Dillon, including a MerrillLynch colleague, two clients, a bank and a bank executive who allallegedly made money in the scheme.   Three brokers at the investment firm then known as E.F. Huttonand two unnamed Advest Inc. brokers also allegedly bought the stocksafter being tipped off by a high-school friend of Dillon's, thelawsuit claims.   SEC officials declined to name the other people and would notcomment on whether further action would be taken in the case.   In addition to Dillon and his mother, also charged are BenjaminLibera, Dillon's high-school friend; Libera's brother Todd; andFrancis R. Sablone Jr., an attorney.   The lawsuit seeks a total of $865,213.16 in alleged illegalprofits _ more than $478,000 from the five people named in the suitand the rest from entities tipped off by Dillon, Benjamin Libera andSablone.   Dillon is alleged to have personally traded in stocks of 110companies favorably discussed in the Business Week column, making$141,591. He also made another $82,016 from trading in a partnershipaccount, according to the suit.   The government contends that on Thursday mornings Dillon paideither $20 for the Business Week column or $30 for the full magazineto various employees of R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co., which prints theweekly publication at two plants in Connecticut. Several Donnelleyemployees were fired in the wake of the scandal.   Dillon, Benjamin Libera and sometimes Sablone met at a diner inOld Saybrook, Conn., early Thursdays to discuss the column anddecide what stocks to buy and sell, according to the lawsuit.   After telling his mother about the scheme, Baird in March 1987opened an account with a discount brokerage and her son called heron Thursday mornings to tell her what stocks to trade, the suitalleges.</TEXT></DOC>
