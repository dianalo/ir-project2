At Edinburgh University in Scotland, researchers haveproduced a single computer chip that incorporates all thecircuitry needed for a video camera. Even with a lens thatfits right on top of the chip, it's still just the size of athumbnail. When they become available in a year or so, suchcameras may carry as little as a $40 price tag.   NCR thinks these tiny cameras could find their way intolots of ATMs in the next few years. The computer makeralready sells ATMs that include cameras, allowing banks todoublecheck on people who contend their account was debitedeven though they didn't use an ATM that day. But thosecameras are expensive, especially because the big box withthe electronics has to be so far back in the ATM that itrequires a long, elaborate lens. The lens also gives away topotential cheats the fact that the camera is there, whereasthe new tiny cameras will just need a pinhole to peepthrough.   &quot;We see this as a breakthrough,&quot; says Greg Scott, anengineer with NCR in Dunfermline, Scotland.   The Scottish Development Agency, which supplied some ofthe initial research funds, says the tiny cameras may alsofind their way into baby monitors, picture telephones,bar-code readers and robotic vision systems.                                                                                                          Salespeople on Road Use   Laptops to Keep in Touch                                                                                                          NOW that tiny laptop computers are able to hold a wholefile cabinet full of documents, they're changing the way manysales representatives do business.   The London Fog clothing division of London Town Corp., forinstance, has outfitted its traveling salespeople with alaptop-based system from Modatech Systems, Vancouver, BritishColumbia. Salespeople hook the computers up to phone lineseach night so the laptops can automatically wake up and checkin with the mother computer for updated information duringthe wee hours of the morning. That way, the salespeoplealways carry with them the latest information on availabilityof products, prices, customers' accounts and so forth.   In the past, the company communicated with salespeople bymail, and information could be days or even weeks out ofdate. Now, if a customer has a question about where adelivery stands, the salesperson doesn't even have to callthe office. A lot of return visits to straighten out problemsare no longer needed.   Each salesman &quot;has his own little mainframe with him,&quot;says Dave Adair, marketing sales controller at London Fog.   Even without laptops, many companies are still findingways to automate their sales operations and keep better tabson prospects. Price Waterhouse, for instance, uses amethodology called Strategic Selling that requiressalespeople to track exactly who will influence a purchase bya companyeven if those people are higher up in the companythan the salesperson usually goes. The system also requiresthe salesperson to keep tabs on how close those people are toa commitment. Because all the data are stored on a computer,Price Waterhouse managers know pretty much where theaccounting firm stands on any given contract.   The whole area of sales-force automation will nearlytriple in size by 1994, according to a study by marketresearcher International Data, Framingham, Mass.                                                                                                          Difficult-to-Read Faxes   Are Getting Phased Out                                                                                                          SMUDGED faxes are getting less common as plain-paper faxmachines begin to take over the market.   Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif.,estimates that U.S. sales of plain-paper faxes nearly doubledlast year to 100,000 units, and that growth will acceleratefrom there. Dataquest says sales will reach 1.3 million unitsin 1995, even though total fax sales will grow only slightlyto 1.6 million units.   Much as people immediately took to plain-paper copiers,fax users also have liked the idea of faxes that wouldn'tsmudge, curl or fade -- drawbacks of most faxes now. Butplain-paper faxes have been expensive.   The appearance in the market of cheap computertechnologies, such as ink-jet printing, is bringing down theprice of plain-paper faxes. Even high-end technologies, suchas laser printing, are coming down in price. SharpElectronics, for instance, just introduced alaser-printer-based fax machine that carries a list price of$3,300; with 40% discounts standard, it may end up sellingfor less than $2,000. That's about half of what the cheapestlaser-based fax cost two years ago.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE black-and-white world of laptop computers is becomingever more colorful. With a handful of respectable colorscreens already on the market, Toshiba recently upped theante with one that consultants say matches the quality ofdesktop computers' monitors. &quot;It's exceptional,&quot; says TimBajarin, a consultant with Creative Strategies ResearchInternational, Santa Clara, Calif. At $9,000, however, thesystem is also expensive. Mr. Bajarin thinks it will be ayear and a half before the price comes down much. . . . T-LanSystems, Norridgewock, Maine, which has software packagesthat help people deluge legislators with mail, now offerssoftware to help angry newspaper readers. The package, calledSolicit Your Editor, provides mailing addresses, fax numbersand key editors' names at 1,600 newspapers and 1,700magazines around the country.</TEXT></DOC>
