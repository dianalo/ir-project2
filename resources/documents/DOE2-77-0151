Lett.53, 2692 (1988)] to be effective at removing nonsuperconducting surfacespecies from YBa{sub 2} Cu{sub 3} O/sub 7-//sub x/ films, leaving thesurface close to the ideal stoichiometry. This same etchant is shownhere to be an effective bulk etchant in chemical depth profiling through1-{mu}m-thick films. The Cu remains in the 2+oxidation state and thestoichiometry, as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, isclose to ideal and nearly constant throughout the profile, indicatingthe absence of any large preferential etching effects. The reaction ofYBa{sub 2} Cu{sub 3} O/sub 7-//sub x/ films with HF/EtOH, HCl/ EtOH,and I/EtOH solutions is also reported.</TEXT></DOC>
