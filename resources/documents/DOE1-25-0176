<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-0176 </DOCNO><TEXT>During the process of elaboration of n/sup +//p InP photodiodes for solarenergy conversion, we have observed that the 700 C sulfur diffusion intoZn doped InP substrates strongly modifies the electrical and photoelectricalproperties of these substrates. A simple annealing at the same temperatureproduces nearly equivalent effects. The most relevant modification isa strong, depth independent hole density increase (more than one orderof magnitude). A degradation of the photoelectrical parameters: diffusionlength L and carrier lifetime tau has also been detected near the surfaceof the heat treated substrates. The deep traps measured from deep leveltransient spectroscopy (DLTS) are not typical of the heat treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
