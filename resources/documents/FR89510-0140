Subtitle F consists ofChapters 301, 302, 303, and 304 and an appendix. The Federal Travel Regulation(FTR) is published in full text in Chapters 301, 302, 303, and 304.This regulation supersedes the Federal Travel Regulations, FPMR 101-7,transmitted by GSA Bulletin FPMR A-40, Supplements 1 through 30, whichwere incorporated by reference in the Federal Property Management Regulations(FPMR) system (41 CFR Part 101-7). To consolidate all FTR information inone place in the CFR, FPMR Temporary Regulations A-24, Revision 1 and Supplement1 thereto; A-30 and Supplement 4 thereto; and A-31, which relate to theFTR, have been removed from the Appendix to Subchapter A of Subtitle C,Chapter 101 and reissued as FTR temporary regulations in the Appendix toSubtitle F.This rule expands public access to the FTR to users of the CFR system.To expedite this process, final promulgation of the FTR is both properand in the public interest. This rule is effective upon publication sinceit simply expands access to the FTR, available now through other sources.There are no changes to allowances or entitlements in this publicationof the FTR that have not been previously published.The FTR has been reformatted and renumbered with some editorial changes.Legal references have been updated and the 1989 income tax tables for paymentof the relocation income tax allowance (published as FPMR Temporary RegulationA-33) have been incorporated.Conversion to the CFR numbering system has been kept as simple as possible.As a general rule, addition of the number ``30'' in front of the formerFTR chapters and parts identification will translate the former numberingto the corresponding chapters and parts in the CFR system. For example,FTR Chapter 1, Part 1 (cited as FTR Part 1-1) is codified as Part 301-1(now cited as 41 CFR Part 301-1).Former main or first level paragraphs are now sections (e.g., former FTRparagraph 1-1.1 is now 41 CFR 301-1.1) divided into lower level paragraphs;e.g., former FTR 1-1.1a is now 41 CFR 301-1.1(a). A general conversiontable is shown below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs60</C> <H1>Paragraph levels</H1><H2>Former FTR </H2><H2>Codified FTR</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">a, b, c <D>(a), (b), (c)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(1), (2), (3) <D>(1), (2), (3)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(a), (b), (c) <D>(i), (ii), (iii)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(i), (ii), (iii) <D>(A), (B), (C)</D></ITAG></ITAG>Exceptions to these general transition rules occur where a former paragraphidentification caused the numbering sequence to change; e.g., former FTR1-1.3c(2-1) is codified as 41 CFR 301-1.3(c)(6). Also, extremely long and/orcomplex paragraphs have been divided into several lower subparagraphs forimproved readability (e.g., former FTR 2-1.5h(4)(a) and (b) related toservice agreements) or separated by subject and raised to the section levelfor easier identification; e.g., former FTR 2-1.5 related to relocationeligibility and conditions is separated by subject and codified as 41 CFR302-1.5 through 302-1.13.<ITAG tagnum="84">Transition Table</ITAG>The following table lists the former FTR unit numbers with the correspondingnew CFR unit numbers.

Agencies shall provide written instructionsto the traveler at the time an authorization is issued advising of agencyadministrative procedures for the control of and accountability for passengertransportation documents. If trips are canceled or itineraries changedafter tickets (or GTR's) are issued to the traveler, the traveler is liablefor the value of the tickets issued until all ticket coupons have beenused for official travel purposes or all unused tickets or coupons areproperly accounted for on the travel voucher. (See also andSection; 301-11.5(c)(1).)A statement to this effect shall be incorporated on the travel authorization,or issued as a ``Notice to Traveler'' and attached to the ticket or GTRwhen issued to the traveler. (See andSection; 301-3.5 for further provisionsregarding unused passenger transportation documents.)(b) <T3>Promotional materials received in connection with official travel fromcommon carriers, rental car companies, or other commercial source. </T3>Employeesare obligated to account for any gift, gratuity, or benefit received fromprivate sources incident to the performance of official business (Comp.Gen.

Additional factors to be considered are the total distance of travel,the number of points visited, and the number of travelers. As stated in5 U.S.C. 5733, ``travel of an employee shall be by the most expeditiousmeans of transportation practicable and shall be commensurate with thenature and purpose of the duties of the employee requiring such travel.''(c) <T3>Traveler's cost liability when selected method is not used. </T3>Thetraveler shall use the method of transportation administratively authorizedor approved by the agency as most advantageous to the Government. (SeeandSection; 301-2.2(b).) Any additional cost resulting from use of a methodof transportation other than that specifically authorized, approved, orrequired by regulation, e.g., contract air service (see paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A)of this section), shall be the traveler's responsibility.(d) <T3>Presumptions as to most advantageous method of transportation</T3>_(1)<T3>Common carrier</T3>_(i) <T3>General. </T3>Travel by common carrier (air, rail, or bus) generallyresults in the most efficient use of energy resources and in the leastcostly and most expeditious performance of travel. Therefore, this methodshall be used whenever it is reasonably available. Other methods of transportationmay be authorized as advantageous only when the use of common carrier transportationwould seriously interfere with the performance of official business orimpose an undue hardship upon the traveler, or when the total cost by commoncarrier would exceed the cost by some other method of transportation. Thedetermination that another method of transportation would be more advantageousto the Government than common carrier transportation shall not be madeon the basis of personal preference or minor inconvenience to the travelerresulting from common carrier scheduling.(ii) <T3>Selecting the most advantageous method of common carrier transportation</T3>_(A)<T3>Contract air service. </T3>The use of discount fares offered by contractair carriers between certain cities (city-pairs) is considered advantageousto the Government and is mandatory for authorized air travel between thosecity-pairs. See andSection; 301-3.4(b)(1)(ii) and FTR Temporary Regulation2, ``Use of contract airline/rail passenger service between selected cities/airports,''for policy and specific guidelines and exceptions.(B) <T3>Noncontract air service. </T3>The use of noncontract air service maybe authorized or approved only when justified under the conditions providedin FTR Temporary Regulation 2. Advance authorization and the justificationfor the use of noncontract air service shall be shown on the travel orderor other form of travel authorization before the actual travel begins,unless extenuating circumstances or emergency situations make advance authorizationimpossible. In those events, the employee shall obtain written approvalfrom the appropriate agency official at the earliest possible time aftercompleting the travel. The approval and justification therefor shall bestated on or attached to the travel voucher.(C) <T3>Rail or bus service. </T3>Rail or bus service may be used when determinedby the agency to be advantageous to the Government, cost, energy, and otherfactors considered, and when compatible with the requirements of the officialtravel. The use of contract or other discount fares offered to the Governmentby rail or bus carriers between selected cities (city-pairs) is consideredadvantageous. Whenever these discount fares are offered and the accompanyingservice will fulfill mission requirements, they should be used to the maximumextent possible. See FTR Temporary Regulation 2, ``Use of contract airline/railpassenger service between selected cities/airports,'' for policy and specificguidelines for use of contract rail service. See also andSection;andSection;301-3.3(b) and 301-3.4(b) for authorized service and accommodations andreduced fares.(2) <T3>Government-contract rental or Government-furnished automobiles. </T3>Whenit is determined that an automobile is required for official travel, aGovernment-contract or a Government-furnished automobile shall be usedas follows:(i) A Government-contract rental automobile is the first resource for short-termrental of an automobile by an employee on temporary duty (TDY) travel.This applies to employees who travel to their destination by common carrier,such as airplane, train, or bus, and would customarily rent a Government-furnishedvehicle for local transportation in the destination area. An employee mayalso use a Government-furnished automobile if a Government-contract rentalautomobile is unavailable or if use of a Government-furnished automobileis practicable. Government-furnished automobiles will continue to be availablefor use in isolated areas where commercial rental contractors are not available.(ii) A Government-furnished automobile is the first resource when an automobileis required for official travel performed locally or within commuting distanceof an employee's designated post of duty. If a Government-furnished automobileis unavailable, a Government-contract rental automobile may be used.(iii) If cost considerations are used in determining whether a Government-contractrental or a Government-furnished automobile should be authorized underthis policy, the overall cost shall include any administrative costs aswell as any costs associated with picking up and returning the automobile.(3) <T3>Privately owned conveyance. </T3>The use of a privately owned conveyanceshall be authorized only when its use is advantageous to the Government,except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. A determination thatthe use of a privately owned conveyance would be advantageous to the Governmentshall be preceded by a determination that transportation by common carrier,a Government-contract rental automobile, or Government-furnished transportationis not available or would not be advantageous to the Government. To themaximum extent possible, these determinations and the authorization touse a privately owned conveyance shall be made before the performance oftravel.(4) <T3>Special conveyance. </T3>Commercially rented vehicles, other than thoseunder contract, and other special conveyances shall be used only when itis determined that use of other methods of transportation discussed inthis paragraph (d) would not be more advantageous to the Government. Inthe selection of commercially rented vehicles, first consideration shallbe given to Government-contract rental vehicles available under an appropriateGSA Federal Supply Schedule contract.(e) <T3>Permissive use of a privately owned conveyance. </T3>When an employeeuses a privately owned conveyance as a matter of personal preference andsuch use is compatible with the performance of official business, althoughnot determined to be advantageous to the Government under paragraph (d)(3)of this section, such use may be authorized or approved provided that reimbursementis limited in accordance with the provisions of Part 301-4.(f) <T3>Travel by ocean vessel. </T3>Except for travel between points servedby ferries, travel by ocean vessel shall not be regarded as advantageousto the Government in the absence of sufficient justification that the advantagesaccruing from the use of ocean transportation offset the higher costs associatedwith this method of transportation; i.e., per diem, transportation, andlost worktime. Authority to authorize or approve travel by ocean vesselshall be obtained at the highest administrative level consistent with agencytravel management policy.

Similarly, where the transportationfurnished is different, or of a lesser value than that authorized on theticket, or where a journey is terminated short of the destination specifiedon the transportation request, the Government is due a refund. The travelershall report these facts to the appropriate agency office under proceduresprescribed by the agency concerned. All adjustments in connection withunfurnished or unused passenger transportation must be promptly reportedto prevent losses to the Government. Failure of travelers to follow theseprocedures may subject them to liability for any resulting losses.(2) As provided in 41 CFR 101-41.209-2, travelers are not authorized toreceive refunds, credits, or any other negotiable documents from carriersfor unfurnished services or unused tickets (or portions thereof) issuedin exchange for a Government transportation request. Instead, the travelershould request a receipt or ticket refund application or other writtenacknowledgement of fare adjustment from the carrier and furnish the carriera ``bill charges to'' address. All unused tickets (including portions thereof),coupons, exchange orders, refund receipts or applications, notices of fareadjustments, etc., and the factual information relating to the unused passengertransportation must be attached to or entered on the travel voucher. Inany case where itineraries are changed or trips are canceled after ticketshave been issued to the traveler, a statement shall be entered on the travelvoucher, and initialed by the traveler, that all tickets have been eitherused for official purposes or all unused tickets, or portions thereof,have been properly accounted for and attached to the voucher.

Ifan employee voluntarily gives up his/her reserved seat and, as a result,incurs additional travel expenses beyond those which he/she would havenormally incurred, these additional expenses must be offset against thepayment received by the employee.

For each 6-hour period,or fraction thereof, one-fourth of the applicable Mandamp;IE rate shall beallowed.(iv) <T3>Lodging obtained after midnight. </T3>Although per diem generally isbased on the employee's location at midnight, there will be instances inwhich he/she is en route and does not arrive at the lodging location (eithertemporary duty location or en route stopover point) until after midnight.In such cases, the lodging shall be claimed for the preceding calendarday and the applicable maximum per diem for the preceding day will be determinedas if the employee had been at the lodging location at 12:00 midnight ofthat day.(3) <T3>Lodging location rules</T3>_(i) <T3>Lodging at temporary duty location. </T3>It is presumed that the employeewill obtain lodging at the temporary duty location. However, if the employeeobtains lodging away from or outside the temporary duty location becauseof personal preference or convenience, the allowable per diem shall belimited to the maximum per diem rate prescribed for the temporary dutylocation.(ii) <T3>Lodging not available at temporary duty location. </T3>In certain circumstances,lodging accommodations may not be available at the temporary duty locationand the employee must obtain lodging in an adjacent locality where theprescribed maximum per diem rate is higher than the maximum per diem ratefor the location of the temporary duty point. In such instances, the agencymay make an administrative determination on an individual case basis toauthorize or approve the higher maximum per diem rate. If the higher maximumrate is not justified and authorized in advance, the employee must furnisha statement with the travel voucher satisfactorily explaining the circumstancesthat caused him/her to obtain lodging in an area other than at the temporaryduty point designated in the travel authorization.(4) <T3>Maximum rate applicable to change of official station travel. </T3>Thestandard CONUS rate shall be the applicable maximum per diem rate for enroute travel performed incident to a change of official station.(c) <T3>Receipt requirements and allowable lodging expenses_</T3>(1) <T3>Lodging receipt requirements. </T3>Receipts shall be required to supportall lodging costs for which an allowance is claimed under the lodgings-plusper diem system except that a statement instead of a receipt may be acceptedfor the fee or service charge incurred for the use of Government quarters.Receipts are not required when a specific or reduced rate has been authorizedin advance of the travel as provided in paragraph (d) of this section andin andSection; 301-7.7.(i) <T3>Double occupancy. </T3>If the lodging receipt shows a charge for doubleoccupancy, such fact shall be shown on the travel voucher with the name,and employing agency or office, of the person sharing the room if suchperson is a Government employee on official travel. One-half of the doubleoccupancy charge shall be allowable for each employee. If the person sharingthe room is not another Government employee on official travel, identificationof the person sharing the room is not required and the employee may beallowed the single room rate.(ii) <T3>Receipts lost or impractical to obtain. </T3>If receipts have beenlost or destroyed or are impractical to obtain, a statement acceptableto the agency explaining the circumstances shall be furnished with thetravel voucher, including the name and address of the lodging facility,the dates the lodging was obtained, and the cost incurred. Agencies mayrequire employees to obtain copies of lost or destroyed receipts from thelodging establishment. (See also andSection; 301-11.3(d).)(2) <T3>Allowable lodging expenses. </T3>As provided in andSection; 301-7.5(a)(1),the traveler will be reimbursed only for his/her actual cost of lodgingup to the maximum amount. No minimum amount is authorized for lodging underthe lodgings-plus per diem system since reimbursement is based on the actualcost of lodging incurred by the employee. Expenses incurred in the situationsdescribed in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) through (v) of this section will beallowed as lodging expenses:(i) <T3>Conventional lodging. </T3>When an employee uses conventional lodgingfacilities (hotels, motels, boarding houses, etc.), the allowable lodgingexpense will be based on the single room rate for the lodging used (fordouble occupancy, see paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section). (See andSection;301-7.9(a) for computing daily lodging expense when lodging is rented ona weekly or monthly basis.)(ii) <T3>Government quarters. </T3>A fee or service charge paid for the useof Government quarters is an allowable lodging expense.(iii) <T3>Lodging with friends or relatives. </T3>When the employee obtains lodgingfrom friends or relatives (including members of the immediate family) withor without charge, no part of the per diem allowance will be allowed forlodging unless the host actually incurs additional costs in accommodatingthe traveler. In such instances, the additional costs substantiated bythe employee and determined to be reasonable by the agency may be allowedas a lodging expense. Neither costs based on room rates for comparableconventional lodging in the area nor flat ``token'' amounts will be consideredas reasonable.(iv) <T3>Lodging in nonconventional facilities. </T3>When no conventional lodgingfacilities are present (e.g., in remote areas) or when there is a shortageof rooms because of an influx of attendees at special events (e.g., world'sfairs or international sports events), costs of lodging obtained in nonconventionalfacilities may be allowed. Such facilities may include college dormitoriesor similar facilities and rooms generally not offered commercially thatare made available to the public by area residents in their homes. In suchcases, the traveler must provide an explanation of the circumstances whichis acceptable to the agency.(v) <T3>Use of travel trailer or camping vehicle for lodgings. </T3>A per diemallowance for lodging may be allowed when the traveler uses a travel traileror camping vehicle while on temporary duty assignments away from his/herofficial station. (See andSection; 301-7.9(b) for per diem computations insuch situations.)(d) <T3>Deviation from lodgings-plus per diem system. </T3>An agency may determinethat the lodgings-plus per diem system as prescribed in this section isnot appropriate for certain travel assignment situations, such as whenquarters or meals, or both, are provided at no cost or at a nominal costby the Government or when for some other reason the subsistence costs tobe incurred by the employee can be determined in advance. (For example,see situations described in andSection;andSection; 301-7.7 and 301-7.9.) Insuch instances, a specific per diem rate may be established within themaximum per diem otherwise applicable to the travel situation and any appropriatereductions made in accordance with andSection; 301-7.7, provided the exceptionfrom the lodgings-plus per diem system and the specific per diem rate areauthorized in advance on the travel authorization by an appropriate officialof the agency concerned. Such specific per diem rate authorized on thetravel authorization shall be the per diem rate payable on the travel voucherwithout receipts and/or itemization by the employee.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301-7.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Per diem computation rules for travel to, from, between, or withinlocations outside CONUS.</ITAG>Except as otherwise provided in this Part 301-7, per diem allowances authorizedor approved for official travel to, from, between, or within locationsoutside CONUS (including travel incident to a change of official station)shall be computed under the quarter-day system as provided in paragraphs(a) through (f) of this section.(a) <T3>Maximum per diem allowable. </T3>Per diem allowances for official travelwithin localities outside CONUS will be at rates not to exceed the maximumper diem rate established under andSection; 301-7.2 (b) or (c) for the localityin which the travel is performed. Per diem allowances for en route travelto, from, or between localities outside CONUS will be determined as providedin paragraph (c) of this section. Whenever lodging is not required duringa calendar day of official travel under this section, the applicable maximumrate shall be reduced to reflect such fact as provided in andSection; 301-7.7(a).(b) <T3>Computation of basic per diem entitlements</T3>_(1) <T3>Travel of 10 hours or less. </T3>Per diem shall not be allowed whenthe travel period is 10 hours or less during the same calendar day (oremployee's workday hours plus 2 hours for employees who would otherwisequalify for per diem solely on the basis of working a non-standard workday;e.g., four 10-hour days or other compressed or flexible schedule), exceptwhen the travel period is 6 hours or more and either begins before 6 a.m.or ends after 8 p.m. (This rule does not apply for en route travel incidentto a change of official station.)(2) <T3>Methods of prorating travel days. </T3>Basic per diem entitlementswill be calculated on a calendar day basis. When a change in travel statusrequires a change in the applicable rate during a calendar day or a perdiem allowance must be calculated for partial days of travel, the travelday will be prorated as follows:(i) <T3>Travel of 24 hours or less. </T3>For continuous travel of 24 hoursor less, the travel period will be divided into 6-hour periods startingfrom the actual time travel begins and ending with its completion at home,office, or other authorized point. For each 6-hour period, or fractionthereof, one-fourth of the applicable per diem rate for a calendar daywill be allowed.(ii) <T3>Travel of more than 24 hours. </T3>In computing per diem allowancesfor travel periods covering more than 24 hours, the calendar day (midnightto midnight) shall be the unit. The calendar day shall be divided intofour 6-hour periods (quarter days) and one-fourth of the applicable perdiem rate shall be allowed for each quarter day. The per diem rate in effectat the beginning of a quarter day shall continue to the end of that quarter.When the per diem rate changes during a calendar day, such rate will takeeffect at the beginning of the next quarter day immediately following thequarter day in which the rate change occurred. For a partial day at thebeginning or ending of a travel period, one-fourth of the applicable perdiem rate for the calendar day shall be allowed for each quarter day, orfraction thereof, that the employee is in a travel status during the partialday.(iii) <T3>30-minute rule. </T3>When the time of departure from home, office,or other authorized point at the beginning of the trip or the time of returnthereto at the end of the trip involves only a 30-minute fraction of aquarter day, per diem shall not be allowed for either such quarter dayunless the traveler provides a statement with the travel voucher explainingthe necessity for the specific time of departure or return that is acceptableto the agency. The 30-minute rule applicable to the payment of per diemas provided herein does not apply to the beginning of continuous travelof 24 hours or less as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section;however, it is applicable to the end of such travel.(3) <T3>International dateline. </T3>In computing per diem in cases where thetraveler crosses the international dateline (180th meridian), the actualelapsed time shall be used to compute per diem rather than calendar days.(c) <T3>Computation of per diem rates for en route travel to, from, or betweenlocations outside CONUS. </T3>The maximum per diem rate for en route travelto, from, or between locations outside CONUS is based on the traveler'stravel time (including time spent at rest stop locations or stopovers atintermediate points) as prescribed in this paragraph (c).(1) <T3>Duty point. </T3>As used herein, the term ``duty point'' means theofficial station outside CONUS, any other place outside CONUS at whichofficial travel begins or ends, or the point of exit or entry within CONUS.(2) <T3>Rates and conditions. </T3>For en route travel beyond the limits ofCONUS by airplane, train, or boat (regardless of whether commercially orGovernment-owned), whether en route between a duty point within CONUS anda locality beyond or between localities outside CONUS, including stopoversof less than 6 hours, the maximum per diem that may be authorized or approved(except for the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is as follows:(i) <T3>Same day return. </T3>When the traveler departs from a duty point withinCONUS or a locality outside CONUS and returns during the same calendarday to a duty point within CONUS or the locality outside CONUS, respectively,the maximum per diem rate allowable for the trip shall be that of the dutypoint at which the trip began. Since lodging is not required in this instance,the per diem rate applicable to any duty point within CONUS shall be thestandard CONUS Mandamp;IE rate prescribed in Appendix A of this chapter.For the same reason, the maximum per diem rate for the origin localityoutside CONUS shall be reduced to an appropriate amount to reflect no lodgingcosts.(ii) <T3>En route less than 6 hours. </T3>For travel other than that describedin paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, when the en route travel time isless than 6 hours between a duty point within CONUS and a duty point ina locality outside CONUS or between two duty points outside CONUS, themaximum per diem rate allowable between duty points shall be that of thedestination duty point. When the destination duty point is within CONUS,the maximum per diem rate shall be the standard CONUS rate prescribed inAppendix A of this chapter, except when a higher rate for travel time atthe duty point is authorized or approved under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) ofthis section.(iii) <T3>En route 6 hours or more. </T3>When the en route travel time is 6 hoursor more between the duty points described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of thissection, the per diem rate applicable for travel between the duty pointsis $6, except:(A) For vessel travel of more than 9 successive calendar days, in additionto the fractional days of embarkation and debarkation, the per diem ratefor the succeeding calendar days and for the fractional day of debarkationis $2; and(B) When either the $6 or $2 rate prescribed herein is not commensuratewith a traveler's subsistence expenses, a different per diem rate may beauthorized or approved not in excess of the maximum per diem rate applicableto the destination duty point or, with respect to vessel travel, not inexcess of $9, except that the rate for travel by the Alaska Ferry Systemshall not exceed the standard Mandamp;IE rate for CONUS.(3) <T3>Stopovers of 6 hours or more. </T3>When the en route travel periodbetween origin and destination duty points involves a stopover at an intermediatepoint and the time spent at the stopover point is 6 hours or more, theper diem rate for the travel period at the stopover point shall be therate applicable to the locality in which the stopover takes place. Theapplicable per diem rate shall take effect at the beginning of the quarterday following the actual time of arrival at the intermediate stopover point.When determining per diem rates for en route travel, the length of timeat an intermediate stopover point is controlling regardless of whetherthe stopover is necessary because of official duty, common carrier scheduling,or an authorized rest stop (see paragraph (c)(6) of this section). Stopoversof less than 6 hours are considered part of the en route travel as providedin paragraph (c)(2) of this section.(4) <T3>Travel beginning or ending within CONUS. </T3>When the travel coveredby this paragraph (c) begins or ends at a place within CONUS other thana duty point, the maximum per diem applicable to the travel between suchplace and the duty point (place of exit or entry) within CONUS, includingtime in a travel status at the duty point or an intermediate location,shall be determined as provided in paragraphs (c)(4) (i) through (iii)of this section.(i) Generally, the applicable maximum per diem rate shall be the standardCONUS maximum per diem rate prescribed in Appendix A of this chapter, exceptthat such maximum rate shall be limited to the Mandamp;IE portion of thestandard CONUS rate in the following travel circumstances:(A) For the day travel begins when the traveler is in an en route travelstatus at 12:00 midnight and no lodging is required that day because ofthe en route travel status; or(B) For the day(s) of return (or day travel ends) when lodging is not requiredbecause of en route status at 12:00 midnight or arrival at home or officialstation.(ii) When either the standard CONUS maximum per diem rate, or the Mandamp;IEportion thereof, is not commensurate with a traveler's subsistence expenses(such as when lodging is required at the duty point or an intermediatelocation), a different rate may be authorized or approved not in excessof the maximum per diem rate applicable for the locality involved; or(iii) When the travel described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section involvestemporary duty within CONUS and lodging is required within CONUS, per diemshall be computed under the lodgings-plus per diem system as provided inandSection; 301-7.6(f). In such instances, paragraph (c)(4) of this sectionapplies only to travel days prior to or immediately following the traveldays for which the lodgings-plus per diem system is applicable.(5) <T3>Travel beginning or ending outside CONUS. </T3>When en route traveloutside CONUS is required between a home, official station, or some otherlocation and the common carrier or other terminal or between localitiesoutside CONUS, and such travel is by a mode of transportation other thanairplane, train, or boat, per diem for the quarter days involved will bebased on the locality rate where the traveler is located at the beginningof each quarter day. Per diem for the first quarter day of the travel willbe at the origin rate.(6) <T3>Rest stops. </T3>(i) When travel is direct between duty points whichare separated by several time zones and at least one duty point is outsideCONUS, a rest period not in excess of 24 hours may be authorized or approvedwhen air travel between the duty points is by less-than-first-class accommodationsand the scheduled flight time (including stopovers of less than 8 hours)exceeds 14 hours by a direct or usually traveled route.(ii) The rest stop may be authorized at any intermediate point, includingpoints within CONUS, provided the point is midway in the journey or asnear to midway as requirements for use of U.S. flag air carriers and carrierscheduling permit.(iii) A rest stop shall not be authorized when an employee, for personalconvenience, elects to travel by an indirect route resulting in excesstravel time.(iv) The per diem rate for the rest stop shall be the rate applicable forthe rest stop location (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section).(v) When carrier schedules or the requirements for use of U.S. flag aircarriers preclude an intermediate rest stop, or a rest stop is not authorized,it is recommended that the employee be scheduled to arrive at the temporaryduty point with sufficient time to allow a reasonable rest period beforereporting for duty. (See andSection; 301-3.6 for guidelines on the use ofU.S. flag carriers.)(d) <T3>When lodging is not located at duty point outside CONUS. </T3>Whensuitable lodging is not available at place of temporary duty in a localityoutside CONUS and the employee is required to obtain lodging in a differentlocality, the maximum applicable per diem rate shall be that of the localityin which the lodging is obtained.(e) <T3>Deductions for meals and/or lodgings furnished. </T3>Where meals and/orlodging are furnished without charge or at a nominal cost by a FederalGovernment agency at a temporary duty station, an appropriate deductionshall be made from the authorized per diem rate. (See andSection; 301-7.7(b).)(f) <T3>Travel involving temporary duty within CONUS. </T3>As a general rule,when travel covered under this section involves temporary duty within CONUSand lodging is required within CONUS incident to such temporary duty eitherat the temporary duty location, the entry or exit duty point within CONUS,or an intermediate stopover point within CONUS, the lodgings-plus per diemsystem prescribed in andSection; 301-7.5 is applicable to the travel timewithin CONUS. For the remainder of the trip, or when temporary duty isof such short duration that lodging is not required, per diem will be computedunder the quarter-day system. The specific rules provided in paragraphs(f) (1) through (3) of this section will be applied to determine specifictime periods for application of the lodgings-plus system.(1) <T3>Round-trip travel beginning outside CONUS. </T3>When round-trip travelis from a duty point outside CONUS for temporary duty within CONUS, thelodgings-plus per diem system takes effect at 12:01 a.m. on the first daylodging is required within CONUS and extends through 12:00 midnight ofthe last calendar day that lodging is required within CONUS.(2) <T3>Travel beginning within CONUS. </T3>When travel begins within CONUSand temporary duty is performed within CONUS prior to departure from theCONUS exit duty point, the lodgings-plus per diem system will be in effectbeginning on the day of departure from home, office, or other authorizedpoint within CONUS through 12:00 midnight of the last calendar day thatlodging is required within CONUS.(3) <T3>Travel ending within CONUS. </T3>When travel ends within CONUS andtemporary duty is performed within CONUS prior to conclusion of the travel,the lodgings-plus per diem system will be in effect beginning at 12:01a.m. on the first day lodging is required within CONUS through the timeof arrival at home, office, or other authorized point within CONUS uponcompletion of the travel.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301-7.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reductions in maximum per diem rates when appropriate (worldwide).</ITAG>An agency may, in individual cases or situations, authorize a reduced perdiem rate under certain circumstances, such as when lodgings and/or mealsare obtained by the employee at a reduced cost or furnished to the employeeat no cost or a nominal cost by the Government; or when for some otherreason the subsistence costs to be incurred by the employee can be determinedin advance. In exercising its responsibilities outlined in andSection; 301-7.1(e),the agency should consider any known factors that will cause the traveler'ssubsistence expenses in a specific situation to be less than the applicablemaximum rates prescribed under andSection; 301-7.2. If it can be determinedin advance of the travel that such factors are present, the agency shouldauthorize a reduced rate that is commensurate with the known expense levels.Such reduced rate authorized on the travel authorization shall be the perdiem rate payable on the travel voucher without receipts and/or itemizationby the employee. When reduced rate situations involve partial days, agenciesmay either prorate the rate by quarters or prescribe a special reducedrate for the partial travel days. Specific guidelines for reducing ratesand situations where reduced rates may be appropriate are provided in paragraphs(a) through (e) of this section.(a) <T3>When no lodging expenses incurred. </T3>For travel within or outsideCONUS which is less than 24 hours or in any other travel situation wherelodging expenses will not be incurred, including instances where lodgingis furnished by the Government without charge, the maximum per diem rateshall be reduced accordingly. For CONUS travel, the lodgings-plus per diemsystem automatically reduces the maximum per diem rate to the Mandamp;IErate (or fraction thereof). When lodging is furnished at no cost to theemployee through use of an agency purchase order, the agency shall notauthorize or approve a per diem allowance for other subsistence expensesthat will, when combined with the cost of lodging furnished, exceed theapplicable maximum per diem rate prescribed under andSection; 301-7.2.(b) <T3>When meals/lodgings are furnished by the Government. </T3>When allor part of the meals and/or lodging are furnished at no cost or at a nominalcost to the employee by the Federal Government, the applicable maximumper diem rate or the Mandamp;IE rate, as appropriate, shall be reduced toa daily amount commensurate with the remaining expenses expected to beincurred by the employee. If a reduced per diem rate was not authorizedin advance of the travel, an appropriate deduction shall be made from thetotal per diem payable on the travel voucher. (See andSection;andSection; 301-7.4(d),301-7.5(a)(2)(ii), and 301-7.6(e).)(c) <T3>Extended stays. </T3>When travel assignments involve extended periodsof more than 30 days at temporary duty locations and travelers are ableto secure lodging and/or meals at lower costs, the per diem rate shouldbe reduced accordingly.

Implementing regulations prescribedby the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) at 5 CFR 410.603 provide specificguidelines for payment of subsistence expenses for employees on extendedtraining assignments of more than 30 calendar days at temporary duty locations.(2) Generally the OPM guidelines require a reduced subsistence paymentof not more than 55 percent of the applicable maximum per diem rate prescribedin this regulation (see andSection; 301-7.2). Subsistence payments abovethese levels (not to exceed the maximum per diem rates) must be justified.Agencies shall refer to the OPM guidelines in 5 CFR 410.603 for specificcriteria to determine the appropriate subsistence payments.

The periodic return travel may be authorized as providedin paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.(i) The head of the agency has determined, based on an appropriate costanalysis, that the costs of periodic weekend return travel (including thecosts of potential overtime, if applicable) are outweighed by savings interms of increased employee efficiency and productivity, as well as reducedcosts of recruitment and retention of employees. This cost analysis shallbe conducted no less frequently than every other year.(ii) Return travel for nonworkdays authorized under these provisions constitutesan exception to the directive on scheduling of travel contained in 5 U.S.C.6101(b)(2) and therefore should be performed outside the employee's regularlyscheduled duty hours or during periods of authorized leave. However, inthe case of employees not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtimeprovisions, consideration should be given to scheduling the authorizedtravel to minimize payment of overtime, including scheduling of travelduring regularly scheduled duty hours when necessary.

The maximum per diem rate, although generally adequate,may be insufficient for a particular travel assignment because the actualand necessary subsistence expenses are unusually high due to special dutiesor because subsistence costs have escalated temporarily during specialevents. Actual subsistence expense reimbursement shall not be authorizedor approved when the actual and necessary subsistence expenses exceed orare expected to exceed the applicable maximum per diem allowance by onlya small amount. Since lodging costs constitute a major portion of the subsistenceexpenses, travel on an actual expense basis may be authorized or approvedfor travel when, due to special or unusual circumstances, the lodging costsabsorb all or nearly all of the applicable maximum per diem allowance.Examples of travel assignments or situations that may warrant authorizationor approval of actual and necessary expenses include but are not limitedto the following:(1) The employee attends a meeting, conference, or training session awayfrom the official duty station where lodging and meals must be procuredat a prearranged place (such as the hotel where the meeting, conference,or training session is being held) and the lodging costs incurred, becauseof these prearranged accommodations, absorb all or practically all of theapplicable maximum per diem allowance;(2) The travel is to an area where the applicable maximum per diem allowanceis generally adequate but subsistence costs have escalated for short periodsof time during special functions or events such as missile launching periods,international or national sports events, world's fairs, conventions, ornatural disasters;(3) Based on a situation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section,affordable lodging accommodations are not available or cannot be obtainedwithin a reasonable commuting distance of the employee's temporary dutypoint and transportation costs to commute to and from the less expensivelodging facility consume most or all of the savings achieved from occupyingless expensive lodging;(4) The employee, because of special duties of the assignment, necessarilyincurs unusually high expenses in the conduct of official business, suchas to procure superior or extraordinary accommodations including a suiteor other quarters for which the charge is well above that which he/shewould normally have to pay for accommodations; or(5) The employee necessarily incurs unusually high expenses incident tohis/her assignment to accompany another employee in a situation as describedin paragraph (a)(4) of this section.(b) <T3>Situations requiring reimbursement for occasional meals and/or lodging.</T3>Although lodging and/or meals are furnished without cost (or at anominal cost) for a particular assignment, the employee may necessarilyincur expenses for occasional lodgings and/or meals.

(b) <T3>Alternate location. </T3>An alternate location is a destination, otherthan the employee's official station or the point of interruption, wherenecessary medical services or a personal emergency situation exists. Inthe case of illness or injury of the employee, the nearest hospital ormedical facility capable of treating the illness or injury is not consideredto be an alternate location.

A sudden illness or injury may include a recurrenceof a previous medical condition thought to have been cured or under control.The illness or injury may occur while the employee is at, or en route toor from, a temporary duty location. (d) <T3>Family. </T3>Family means those individuals defined in andSection; 302-1.4(e)of this title who are members of the employee's household at the time theemergency situation arises. For compassionate reasons, when warranted bythe circumstances of a particular emergency situation, an agency may onan individual case basis expand this definition to encompass other membersof the extended family of an employee and employee's spouse, such as theindividuals named in andSection; 302-1.4(e) of this title who are not dependentsof the employee or members of the employee's immediate household. In usingthis authority and deciding each case, agencies shall evaluate the extentof the emergency and the employee's relationship to, and degree of responsibilityfor, the individual(s) involved in the emergency situation.

Such per diem maybe continued for a reasonable period, normally not to exceed 14 calendardays (including fractional days) for any one period of absence. However,a longer period may be approved by the employee's agency if justified bythe circumstances of a particular case. The point of interruption may includethe nearest hospital or medical facility capable of treating the employee'sillness or injury.

The nearest hospital or medical facility capable of treating theemployee's illness or injury will not be considered an alternate location(see andSection; 301-12.4(b)). (2) <T3>Calculation of excess costs. </T3>The reimbursement that may be authorizedor approved under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall be the excess(if any) of actual costs of travel from the point of interruption to thealternate location and return to the temporary duty assignment, over theconstructive costs of round-trip travel between the official station andthe alternate location. The actual cost of travel will be the transportationexpenses incurred and en route per diem for the travel as actually performedfrom the point of interruption to the alternate location and from the alternatelocation to the temporary duty assignment. (No per diem is allowed forthe time spent at the alternate location.) The constructive cost of travelis the sum of transportation expenses the employee would reasonably haveincurred for round-trip travel between the official station and the alternatelocation (had the travel begun at the official station) plus per diem calculatedunder Part 301-7 for the appropriate en route travel time.

An employee hired locally at a locationoutside the continental United States who claims residence at another locationin the United States or its possessions or in the Commonwealth of PuertoRico at time of appointment, shall designate in writing the claimed placeof actual residence for the consideration of agency officials. (2) <T3>Determination by agency official. </T3>Determination of the place ofactual residence shall be made by an authorized agency official on thebasis of all the facts in the record. When there is doubt as to the placeof actual residence, the employee is responsible for supplying any furtherinformation necessary to support designation of the claimed place of actualresidence. (3) <T3>Guidance in determination of residence. </T3>While it is not feasibleto establish rigid standards for what constitutes a place of residence,the concept of residence represented in an existing statutory provision(8 U.S.C. 1101(33)) may be used as general guidance. This concept viewsresidence as the place of general abode, meaning the principal, actualdwelling place in fact, without regard to intent. Determination of theplace of actual residence is primarily an administrative responsibilityand the place constituting the actual residence must be determined uponthe factual circumstances in each case. Examples of factors which shallbe considered, whenever applicable, by agency officials charged with thisresponsibility are: (i) The place of actual residence of a dependent student generally is presumedto be the same as that of the parents and, except in rare instances, thissituation would not be changed by the student attending college in anotherplace. (ii) The place at which the employee physically resided at time of selectionfor appointment or transfer frequently constitutes the place of actualresidence and shall be so regarded in the absence of circumstances reasonablyindicating that another location may be designated as the place of actualresidence. (iii) Designation of a place of actual residence in an official documentsigned by the employee earlier in Government employment shall be regardedas originally intended to be a continuing designation, and the burden isupon the employee to establish clearly that the earlier designation wasin error or that later circumstances entitle a different designation tobe made. After an employee has been transferred or appointed to a postof duty outside the continental United States, the location of the placeof actual residence incorporated in the official records of such employmentshall be changed only to correct an error in the designation of residence.(iv) Presence in the individual's work history of a representative amountof full-time employment at or in the immediate geographic area of the locationdesignated as place of actual residence is a significant factor, but lackof such history does not preclude the designation of the location as placeof actual residence. (v) The chronological record of individual or family association with alocality is usually significant only in connection with an analysis ofother circumstances explaining the nature of such association. Frequentor extended visits to a locality must be evaluated in relation to the purposeof the visits and sometimes in relation to the nature of the area itself.For example, vacation visits to a resort area, without the added supportof other factors, should not be regarded as adequate to establish a placeof actual residence. (vi) Recognition and exercise by the employee of the privileges and dutiesof citizenship in a particular jurisdiction, such as voting and paymentof taxes on income and personal property are factors for consideration,but agency application of standards about place of residence should notbe such as to discourage employees from property ownership or participationin community affairs at a nonforeign location outside the continental UnitedStates. (d) <T3>Return for separation. </T3>When an employee is eligible for returntravel and transportation to his/her place of actual residence upon separationafter completion of the period of service specified in an agreement executedunder andSection; 302-1.5(b) or is separated for reasons beyond his/her controland acceptable to the agency concerned, he/she may receive travel and transportationto an alternate location, provided the cost to the Government shall notexceed the cost of travel and transportation to his/her residence at thetime he/she was assigned to an overseas station. However, under decisionsof the Comptroller General, ordinarily, an employee is entitled to traveland transportation expenses upon separation only to the country of actualresidence at the time of assignment to such duty. (e) <T3>Prior return of immediate family</T3>_(1) <T3>When employee is eligible for return transportation. </T3>When an employeehas become eligible for return transportation by satisfactorily completingan agreed period of service at a post of duty outside the continental UnitedStates, the Government shall pay one-way transportation expenses for returningthe employee's immediate family and household goods before the employee'sreturn to his/her place of actual residence in the 50 States, the Districtof Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the United States territoriesor possessions. (2) <T3>Return for compassionate reasons. </T3>One-way transportation expensesfor the return of the employee's immediate family and his/her householdgoods also may be paid without regard to the employee's completion of anagreed period of service provided it has been determined under regulationsprescribed by the head of the agency concerned that the public interestrequires the return of the immediate family for compelling personal reasonsof a humanitarian or compassionate nature, which may involve physical ormental health, death of a member of the immediate family, or obligationsimposed by authority or circumstances over which the individual has nocontrol. (3) <T3>Limited to one return trip. </T3>Expenses allowed as provided in paragraphs(e) (1) and (2) of this section shall be paid by the Government not morethan one time during each agreed period of service and are subject to Chapter301 of this title. (4) <T3>Part of household goods retained overseas. </T3>In connection withthe prior return of his/her family, the employee may elect to retain aportion of the household goods with him/her at the post of duty and shipthe remainder to his/her place of actual residence. In such an instance,the Government will pay for shipment of both parts of the household goods,provided the aggregate weight of both shipments does not exceed the applicableweight limits. (5) <T3>Alternate destination. </T3>If the employee's immediate family andhousehold goods are returned to a location in the 50 States, the Districtof Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or to a United States territoryor possession other than the place of actual residence therein, the allowableexpenses shall not exceed those allowable for return over a usually traveledroute between the post of duty and the place of actual residence. (6) <T3>Prior return at employee's expense_reimbursement. </T3>There may becircumstances in which an employee elects to return his/her immediate familyand the household goods or any part thereof at his/her own expense to anyof the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of PuertoRico, or a United States territory or possession when he/she is not eligiblefor such transportation under this paragraph (e). In such an instance,and after the employee becomes eligible for transportation at Governmentexpense, he/she may be reimbursed for the proper expenses which he/shehad previously paid. He/She will be reimbursed in accordance with the applicableprovisions of this paragraph (e) only for expenses which are supportedby receipts or other appropriate documentation furnished to the Governmentunder regulations prescribed by the head of the agency concerned.(f) <T3>Return of former spouse and dependents. </T3>Paragraph (e) of thissection also applies to the spouse and dependents of an employee who havetraveled to the employee's overseas post of duty as dependents (as providedin andSection; 302-1.4(e)) at Government expense, even if, because of divorceor annulment, such individuals will have ceased to be dependents as ofthe date the employee becomes eligible for return travel. Travel of suchformer dependents is authorized by the employee's next entitlement to returntravel but not beyond the end of the employee's current agreed tour ofduty. (g) <T3>Return of family member over 21. </T3>If a member of the immediatefamily, as defined in andSection; 302-1.4(e), reaches his/her twenty-firstbirthday while the employee is assigned to duty overseas, that person maybe returned to the United States (or foreign location at which the actualresidence is located) at Government expense, provided his/her last traveloverseas was at Government expense as a member of the employee's immediatefamily. Return of that person is authorized by the employee's next entitlementto travel to the United States (or foreign location at which the actualresidence is located) but not beyond the end of the employee's currentagreed tour of duty. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-1.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Overseas tour renewal agreement travel. </ITAG>Employees may be eligible to receive allowances for travel and transportationexpenses for the purpose of returning home to take leave between toursof duty overseas as provided in this section.

Separate round trips by theemployee and spouse may be allowed provided the overall cost to the Governmentis limited to the cost of one round trip for the employee and spouse travelingtogether. A round trip performed by the employee for this purpose, whenauthorized, must be accomplished before reporting to the new official station.A round trip by the spouse, when authorized, may be accomplished at anytime before relocation of the family to the new official station but notafter the expiration of the maximum time for beginning allowable traveland transportation. (See andSection; 302-1.6.) An appropriate official ofthe agency that will be responsible for payment of the travel and transportationallowances for the employee shall decide whether this trip should be authorized.(b) A trip to seek residence quarters shall be authorized only when thecircumstances indicate that it is actually needed. This Part 302-4 shallbe administered to minimize or avoid the expense involved whenever othersatisfactory and more economical arrangements can be made. For example,if the employee must promptly vacate the residence at his/her old postof duty, it may be less costly to the Government and more convenient tothe employee to complete arrangements for new residence quarters beforethe move actually takes place. A trip for the purpose of finding and arrangingnew residence quarters may be justified in such circumstances. (c) In other situations, it may be less costly to allow the employee andhis/her family to remain in temporary quarters at the new official stationfor a longer period than might otherwise be required, subject to the limitationsof Part 302-5, until permanent quarters are found. If temporary quartersare to be authorized, a trip for seeking permanent residence quarters maybe avoided. Similarly, it may be less costly to the Government and moresatisfactory to the employee for the employee's immediate family to remainat the residence in the old official station locality after the employeehas reported at his/her new official station and has time to select permanentquarters after he/she has had an opportunity to become more familiar withneighborhoods, local transportation facilities, schools, and the housingmarket. In some instances the employee may be on temporary duty at thenew station for a period before the actual transfer becomes effective.Under these circumstances, a special trip by the employee to the new officialstation for the purpose of finding quarters should not be necessary. Itmay also be possible for the agency to avoid or shorten the duration ofa trip by providing assistance and information to the employee concerninglocal housing conditions and markets. These guidelines shall be observedin order to eliminate wasteful or unnecessary trips. In addition, reimbursementfor travel and transportation expenses for trips to seek permanent quartersshall not be authorized under the following circumstances: (1) When an employee will be assigned to Government or other prearrangedresidence quarters at the new official station location; (2) When the employee has not yet formally agreed to transfer to the newstation (see andSection; 302-1.5(a)); (3) When either the old or new duty station, or both, are located outsidethe continental United States; and (4) When the map distance between the old and new stations is less than75 miles via a usually traveled surface route. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-4.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Duration of trip.</ITAG>The round trip should be allowed for a reasonable period of time consideringdistance between the old and new official stations, mode of transportationto be used, and the housing situation at the new official station location.In no instance shall the period of the round trip at Government expensebe allowed in excess of 10 calendar days, including travel time. In authorizingor allowing a particular mode of transportation, consideration shall begiven to providing minimum time en route and maximum time at the new officialstation locality. Accordingly, if the use of a privately owned automobileis permitted, this use is considered advantageous to the Government andthe mileage allowance shall be as provided in andSection; 302-2.3 (b) and(c). Reasonable expenses for local transportation at the location of thenew official station shall be allowed. Agencies may authorize local transportationby common carrier, local transit systems, commercially rented automobiles,or privately owned automobiles; however, the mode of local transportationmust be consistent with the mode of transportation authorized for travelto and from the new official station.

As a general policy, the period fortemporary quarters shall be reduced or avoided if a round trip to seekpermanent residence quarters has been made or if, as a result of extendedtemporary duty at the new official station or other circumstances (forexample, if the family does not move until some time after the employee'stransfer), the employee has had adequate opportunity to complete arrangementsfor permanent quarters.

The total period of time intemporary quarters shall not exceed 120 days under any circumstances. Thesame considerations as expressed in andSection; 302-5.1 are applicable inallowing any part of the additional 60 days. Authorizations to extend thetemporary quarters period and the number of days authorized shall be heldto a minimum. Extensions of the temporary quarters period may be authorizedonly in situations where there is a demonstrated need for additional timedue to circumstances which have occurred during the initial 60-day periodof occupancy and which are determined to be beyond the employee's controland acceptable to the agency. Examples of compelling reasons which couldbe considered as beyond the employee's control may include, but are notlimited to, the following situations: (i) Shipment and/or delivery of household goods to new residence is delayeddue to extended transit time incident to ocean transportation, strikes,customs clearance, hazardous weather, fires, floods or other acts of God,or similar events. (ii) New permanent residence cannot be occupied because of unanticipatedproblems (delays in settlement on new residence, short term delay in constructionof a new residence, etc.).(iii) Inability to locate permanent residence which is adequate for familyneeds because of housing conditions at the new official station.(iv) Sudden illness, injury, or death of employee or immediate family member.(3) <T3>Authorizing less than maximum time. </T3>The specified time limitsare maximum periods, and the normal length of necessary occupancy of temporaryquarters is expected to average much less. Temporary quarters should beregarded as an expedient to be used only if, or for as long as, necessaryuntil the employee concerned can move into permanent residence quarters.(b) <T3>Transfer to foreign area. </T3>When the new official station is locatedin a foreign area, the employee is not eligible for temporary quartersallowances under this regulation. When temporary lodgings are obtainedin a foreign area, or in the United States prior to transferring to a foreignarea, the employee may be eligible for an allowance under the StandardizedRegulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) prescribed by the Departmentof State. (c) <T3>What constitutes temporary quarters. </T3>Generally, the term ``temporaryquarters'' refers to lodging obtained from private or commercial sourcesfor the purpose of temporary occupancy after vacating the residence occupiedwhen the transfer was authorized. However, occupancy of temporary quartersthat eventually become the employee's permanent residence shall not preventpayment of the temporary quarters allowance if, in the agency's judgment,the employee shows satisfactorily that the quarters occupied were intendedinitially to be only temporary. In making this determination, the agencyshould consider factors such as the duration of the lease, movement ofhousehold effects into the quarters, type of quarters, expressions of intent,attempts to secure a permanent dwelling, and the length of time the employeeoccupies the quarters.(d) <T3>Temporary quarters located at other than official station. </T3>Asa general rule, the location of the temporary quarters must be within reasonableproximity of the old and/or new official station. Payment of subsistenceexpenses for occupancy of temporary quarters in other locations shall notbe allowed unless justified by circumstances unique to the individual employeeor the employee's family that are reasonably related and incident to thetransfer. Payment for such expenses must be authorized or approved by thehead of the employing agency, or his/her designee, provided the designeeis at a level high enough to ensure adequate review of the circumstancesinvolved and to determine that payment of the temporary quarters allowanceis justified. Occupancy of temporary quarters shall not be approved forvacation purposes or other reasons unrelated to the transfer.(e) <T3>Beginning of eligibility period. </T3>The use of temporary quartersfor subsistence expense purposes under these provisions may begin as soonas the employee's transfer has been authorized, and the written agreementrequired in andSection; 302-1.5 has been signed. In order to be eligiblefor the temporary quarters allowance, the period of use of such quartersfor which a claim for reimbursement is made must begin not later than 30days from the date the employee reported for duty at his/her new officialstation, or if not begun during this period, not later than 30 days fromthe date the family vacates the residence at the old official station,but not beyond the maximum time for beginning allowable travel and transportation.(See andSection; 302-1.6.)(f) <T3>Computation of eligibility period and termination. </T3>When computingthe length of time allowed for temporary quarters at Government expense,the time period will begin for the employee and all members of the immediatefamily when either the employee or any member of the immediate family beginsthe period of use of such quarters for which a claim for reimbursementis made. The time period shall run concurrently for the employee and allmembers of the immediate family. The employee may occupy temporary quartersat one location while members of the immediate family occupy quarters atanother location. (However, see limitations in paragraph (d) of this section.)The period of eligibility shall terminate when the employee or any memberof the immediate family occupies permanent residence quarters or when theauthorized period of time expires, whichever occurs first.(g) <T3>Effect of partial days on eligibility period. </T3>Occupancy of temporaryquarters for less than a whole day constitutes one full calendar day ofthe eligibility period. (1) <T3>Claim for temporary quarters when occupancy begins the same day enroute travel ends. </T3>The guidelines in paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and (ii)of this section shall be used for determining the eligibility period fortemporary quarters subsistence expense reimbursement and in computing maximumreimbursement when occupancy of temporary quarters for reimbursement purposesoccurs the same day that en route travel per diem ends.(i) <T3>En route travel of more than 24 hours. </T3>When en route travel ismore than 24 hours, the eligibility period for reimbursement for temporaryquarters subsistence expenses shall start at the beginning of the calendarday quarter immediately following the calendar day quarter in which enroute travel per diem ends. (ii) <T3>En route travel of 24 hours or less. </T3>When en route travel is 24hours or less, the eligibility period for reimbursement for temporary quarterssubsistence expenses shall start at the beginning of the same calendarday quarter in which en route travel per diem ends. (2) <T3>Claims for temporary quarters occupancy in all other cases. </T3>Inall cases other than those covered in paragraph (g)(1) of this section(e.g., when occupancy of temporary quarters occurs at the old officialstation or when reimbursement for occupancy of temporary quarters is notclaimed on the same day that en route travel per diem begins or ends),the temporary quarters period shall start as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. (i) <T3>Old and new official stations within the continental United States.</T3>When both the old and new official stations are within the continentalUnited States, the temporary quarters period shall start at 12:01 a.m.of the calendar day (see andSection; 301-7.1(b)(1) of this title) in whichtemporary quarters subsistence expense reimbursement is claimed, providedthe temporary quarters are occupied during that calendar day. (ii) <T3>Old and/or new official station outside the continental United States.</T3>When the old and/or new official station is outside the continentalUnited States, the temporary quarters shall start with the first quarterof the calendar day in which temporary quarters subsistence expense reimbursementis claimed, provided the temporary quarters are occupied during that calendarday.(3) <T3>Termination of eligibility period. </T3>The temporary quarters periodshall terminate at midnight of the last day of eligibility.(h) <T3>Allowance when short distance transfer is involved. </T3>An employeeor members of his/her immediate family shall not be eligible for temporaryquarters expenses when the distance between the new official station andold residence is not more than 40 miles greater than the distance betweenthe old residence and the old official station, except that the expensesof temporary quarters are allowable for the period during which the employeeis awaiting the arrival of his/her household goods shipped from the oldto the new residence, provided the use of such quarters is begun not laterthan the maximum time for beginning allowable travel and transportation.All measurements shall be made according to map distance along a usuallytraveled route. (i) <T3>Duplication of other allowances. </T3>In no cases shall subsistenceexpenses under these provisions be allowed which duplicate, in whole orin part, payments received under other laws or regulations covering similarcosts.

This reviewand approval are intended to be limited to determining whether the expensesclaimed are reasonable in amount and customarily paid by the seller inthe locality where the property is located. If items of cost appear tohave been inflated or are higher than normally imposed for similar servicesin the locality, any portion of such costs determined to be excessive shallbe disallowed. When approved, the application shall be returned with suchmemorandum of explanation as may be appropriate. A similar review and approvalare required in connection with an application for reimbursement of theexpenses of the purchase of a new dwelling. Final administrative approvalof payment of the claim must be executed by an appropriate approving official.Such official may accept as conclusive the required prior approvals coveringreasonableness and custom; he/she shall, however, in accordance with theprovisions of this Part 302-6, independently determine whether (1) theaggregate amount of expenses claimed in connection with a sale or purchaseof a residence is within the prescribed limitation for either, (2) allconditions and requirements under which allowances may be paid have beenmet, and (3) the expenses themselves are those which are reimbursable.The employee's claim accompanied by the application and supporting documentsshall be completed and submitted in accordance with the usual proceduresof the agency concerned.

The local office maintains and can furnish upon request a currentForm HUD-92496, Schedule of Closing Costs, applicable to the area. Thisis a schedule of closing costs typically encountered in connection withthe purchase and sale of single family properties in the locality. Forthe purpose of determining whether the expenses claimed are reasonableand may be approved for reimbursement, these closing costs should be usedas guidelines and not as rigid limitations. The local office will alsofurnish upon request information concerning local custom and practiceswith respect to charging of closing costs related to either a sale or purchase,including information as to whether such costs are customarily paid bythe seller or purchaser and the local terminology used to describe them.Area or insuring offices of HUD are located in all major cities.

The total weight of household goodsstored under andSection; 302-9.2 plus the weight of household goods transportedunder this Part 302-8 shall not exceed the maximum weight allowance prescribedin this paragraph (a). (b) <T3>Professional books, papers, and equipment. </T3>(1) For purposes ofthis Part 302-8, the term ``professional books, papers, and equipment''includes those professional or specialized items and other materials whichare personally owned by the employee for use in the performance of officialduties. The term does not include sports equipment or office, household,or shop fixtures and furniture; e.g., bookcases, file cabinets, desks,and racks of any kind even though used in connection with the professionalbooks, papers, and equipment. (2) There is no statutory authority to transport personally owned professionalbooks, papers, and equipment in addition to the maximum weight allowance(andSection; 302-8.2(a)) established by law for transportation of an employee'shousehold goods and personal effects. However, there may be instances inwhich the weight of the professional books, papers, and equipment wouldcause an employee's household goods shipment to be in excess of the maximumweight allowance. In such instances, the personally owned professionalbooks, papers, and equipment may be transported to the new permanent dutystation as an administrative expense of an agency (not chargeable to traveland transportation appropriations). Shipment of these items as an administrativeexpense would be instead of shipment as an allowance of the employee. (3) Authority to transport professional books, papers, and equipment asan administrative expense shall be subject to agency policy and discretionwithin the following guidelines: (i) The employee shall furnish an itemized inventory of professional books,papers, and equipment for review by an appropriate authorizing officialat the new permanent duty station. In addition, the employee shall furnishappropriate evidence (as determined by the agency concerned) that transportingthe itemized materials as part of the employee's household goods wouldresult in an excess of the employee's maximum weight allowance. (ii) The authorizing official at the new permanent duty station shall reviewand certify that the professional books, papers, and equipment as itemizedare necessary in the proper performance of the employee's duties at thenew duty station and that if these items were not transported to the newduty station, the same or similar items would have to be obtained at Governmentexpense for the employee's use at the new duty station. (iii) When professional books, papers, and equipment are certified as providedin paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and shipped for the employee asan administrative expense of an agency, shipment shall be by the actualexpense method; the commuted rate method shall not be used. When shippedin the same lot with the employee's household goods and other personaleffects under the actual expense method, the professional books, papers,and equipment shall be packed and weighed separately; the weight thereofand the administrative appropriation chargeable shall be stated as separateitems on the Government bill of lading. In unusual instances in which itis impractical or impossible to obtain separate weights, a constructiveweight of 7 pounds per cubic foot may be used.(c) <T3>Determining the net weight_</T3>(1) <T3>Uncrated shipments. </T3>When household goods are shipped uncratedas in a household mover's van or similar conveyance, the net weight shallbe that shown on the bill of lading or on the weight certificate attachedthereto, which, under Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) regulations,includes the weight of barrels, boxes, cartons, and similar materials usedin packing, but does not include pads, chains, dollies, and other equipmentneeded to load and secure the shipment. When a noncommercial means of shipmentis involved (see andSection; 302-8.3(a)(3)), the ICC regulations shall applyfor determining the net weight. When an employee's claim is based on constructiveweight as authorized in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the net weightshall be the weight as determined under that provision.(2) <T3>Crated shipments. </T3>When property is transported crated, the netweight shall not include the weight of the crating material. The net weightshall be computed as being 60 percent of the gross weight. However, ifthe net weight computed in this manner exceeds the applicable weight limitationand if it is determined that, for reasons beyond the employee's control,unusually heavy crating and packing materials were necessarily used, thenet weight may be computed at less than 60 percent of the gross weight.(3) <T3>Containerized shipments. </T3>When special containers designed normallyfor repeated use, such as lift vans, CONEX transporters, and household-goodsshipping boxes are used and the known tare weight does not include theweight of interior bracing and padding materials but only the weight ofthe container, the net weight of the household goods shall be 85 percentof the gross weight less the weight of the container. If the known tareweight includes interior bracing and padding materials so that the netweight is the same as it would be for uncrated shipments in interstatecommerce, the net weight shall not be subject to the reduction. If thegross weight of the container cannot be obtained, the net weight of thehousehold goods shall be determined from the cubic measurement on the basisof 7 pounds per cubic foot of properly loaded container space. (4) <T3>Constructive weight. </T3>If no adequate scale is available at pointof origin, at any point en route, or at destination, a constructive weight,based on 7 pounds per cubic foot of properly loaded van space, may be used.Such constructive weight also may be used for a part-load when its weightcould not be obtained at origin, en route, or at destination, without firstunloading it or other part-loads being carried in the same vehicle, orwhen the household goods are not weighed because the carrier's chargesfor a local or metropolitan area move are properly computed on a basisother than the weight or volume of the shipment (as when payment is basedon an hourly rate and the distance involved). However, in such instancesthe employee should obtain a statement from the carrier showing the amountof properly loaded van space required for the shipment. (See also andSection;302-8.3(a)(3) with respect to proof of entitlement to a commuted rate paymentwhen net weight cannot be shown.) (d) <T3>Temporary storage time limit. </T3>The time allowable for temporarystorage in connection with an authorized shipment of household goods shallnot exceed a period of 90 days. This time period also applies when an employeereturns to his/her place of actual residence for leave before serving anew tour of duty outside the continental United States either at a differentpost of duty or at the same post of duty if the storage is provided insteadof furnished quarters or a quarters allowance. However, upon an employee'swritten request, the initial 90-day period may be extended an additionalperiod not to exceed 90 days under certain conditions if approved by theagency head or his/her designee. Justification for an additional storageperiod may include, but is not limited to, the following reasons: (1) An intervening temporary duty or long-term training assignment; (2) Nonavailability of suitable housing; (3) Completion of residence under construction; (4) Serious illness of employee or illness or death of a dependent; or(5) Strikes, acts of God, or other circumstances beyond the control ofthe employee. (e) <T3>Origin and destination. </T3>Cost of transportation of household goodsmay be paid by the Government whether the shipment originates at the employee'slast official station or place of residence or at some other point, orif part of the shipment originates at the last official station and theremainder at one or more other points. Similarly, these expenses are allowablewhether the point of destination is the new official station or some otherpoint selected by the employee, or if the destination for part of the propertyis the new official station and the remainder is shipped to one or moreother points. However, the total amount which may be paid or reimbursedby the Government shall not exceed the cost of transporting the propertyin one lot by the most economical route from the last official stationof the transferring employee (or the place of actual residence of the newappointee at time of appointment) to the new official station. In connectionwith return from overseas for separation, see andSection; 302-1.12(d). Noproperty acquired by the employee en route between old and new officialstations shall be eligible for transportation under this Part 302-8. (f) <T3>Loss and damage liability. </T3>Limitations on the Government's liabilityfor loss or damage of an employee's household goods are contained in theMilitary Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act of 1964 (31 U.S.C.3721-3723) and in agency rules and regulations issued under the authoritythereof. Since agency practices and regulations under that Act differ,and in view of the different circumstances under which household goodsare transported and temporarily stored under the authority of this Part302-8, each agency should advise transferred employees of the applicabilityand restrictions on claims against the Government for loss and damage asrelated to the transportation circumstances involved. Agencies should alsobe prepared to give advice to employees as to the liability of the carrierfor loss and damage of transported household goods in the transportationcircumstances involved so that they will be able to evaluate the need forinsurance and the advisability of incurring a valuation charge. (For interstateshipments by motor carrier on commercial bills of lading, see 49 CFR Part1056.)<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-8.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Transportation within the continental United States.</ITAG>(a) <T3>The commuted rate system_</T3>(1)<T3> Description. </T3>Under the commuted rate system an employee makeshis/her own arrangements for transporting household goods between pointswithin the continental United States. He/She selects and pays the carrieror transports his/her goods by noncommercial means and is reimbursed bythe Government in accordance with schedules of commuted rates which arecontained in the GSA publication Commuted Rate Schedule for Transportationof Household Goods. Agencies requiring this publication shall prepare aStandard Form 1, Printing and Binding Requisition, and send it to: Superintendentof Documents, Departmental Account Representative Division, U.S. GovernmentPrinting Office (GPO), Washington, DC 20401. The schedules of commutedrates which are developed from tariffs that carriers have filed with theInterstate Commerce Commission consist of tables to be applied to the particulartransportation involved. The commuted rate includes costs of line-haultransportation, packing, crating, unpacking, drayage incident to transportation,and other accessorial charges. Costs of temporary storage which are subjectto reimbursement under andSection; 302-8.5 are stated separately in the scheduleof commuted rates. (2) <T3>Reimbursement. </T3>When the commuted rate system is used, the amountto be paid to the employee for transportation and related services is computedby multiplying the number of hundreds of pounds shipped (within the maximumweight allowance) by the applicable rate per hundred pounds for the distanceshipped as shown in the commuted rate schedule. The distance shall be determinedin accordance with household goods mileage guides filed with the InterstateCommerce Commission. If the rate is not shown in the commuted rate schedulefor the exact mileage, the rate shown for the next greater distance applies.If an employee is charged a minimum weight above the actual weight of his/herhousehold goods under the applicable tariff (other than one based on expeditedor special services), the reimbursement shall be based on the minimum weightas charged instead of the actual weight of the goods. (3) <T3>Documentation. </T3>Claims for reimbursement under the commuted ratesystem shall be supported by a receipted copy of the bill of lading (areproduced copy may be accepted) including any attached weight certificatecopies if such a bill was issued. If no bill of lading was involved, otherevidence showing points of origin and destination and the weight of thegoods must be submitted. Employees who transport their own household goodsare cautioned to establish the weight of such goods by obtaining properweight certificates showing gross weight (weight of vehicle and goods)and tare weight (weight of vehicle alone) because compliance with the requirementsfor payment at commuted rates on the basis of constructive weight (seeandSection; 302-8.2(b)(4)) usually is not possible. (b) <T3>Actual expense method_</T3>(1)<T3> Description. </T3>Under the actual expense method, the Governmentassumes responsibility for awarding contracts and for other negotiationswith carriers. The property is shipped on a Government bill of lading,and the Government audits and pays transportation vouchers directly tocarriers. Under the actual expense method, the household goods are shippedby the Government, not by the employee. (2) <T3>Agency responsibility. </T3>Selection of the carrier, arranging forcarrier services and for packing and crating, preparing the Governmentbill of lading, paying charges incurred, and processing any loss and damageclaims are the direct responsibility of the agency. (3) <T3>Allowable charges. </T3>The actual costs of transportation of householdgoods within the authorized weight limits will be allowed at Governmentexpense. Also, within that weight limit, the actual costs for packing,crating, unpacking, drayage incident to transportation, and necessary accessorialservices shall be allowed. (4) <T3>Multiple shipment procedures. </T3>When the actual expense method isused in shipping household goods belonging to two or more employees betweenthe same two points, the weight of the household goods of each employeeis to be identified for the purpose of applying the maximum weight limitations.(5) <T3>Excess weight procedures. </T3>When the weight of an employee's householdgoods exceeds the maximum weight limitation, the total quantity may beshipped on a Government bill of lading, but the employee shall reimbursethe Government for the cost of transportation and other charges applicableto the excess weight, computed from the total charges according to theratio of excess weight to the total weight of the shipment. (c) <T3>Use of commuted rate or actual expense method_</T3>(1)<T3> Considerations. </T3>When the commuted rate system is used, the Governmentis relieved of the responsibility and administrative expense of selectingand dealing with carriers and making other arrangements for transportingemployees' household goods; however, the Government cannot take advantageof special discounts which may be offered. On the other hand, when theactual expense method is used, the Government incurs the additional expensesof selecting and dealing with carriers, preparing bills of lading, auditingand paying transportation vouchers, supervising the packing of householdgoods, handling employee loss and damage claims, and other incidentals.(2) <T3>Estimating costs. </T3>Under the commuted rate system, an accurateestimate of cost depends upon the accuracy of the estimate of weight. However,under the actual expense method the cost to the Government will usuallydepend not only on the weight involved but also on the accessorial servicesrequired, the quality of packing and the quantity of individual cartons,boxes, barrels, and wardrobes used by the carrier in packing. When thecommuted rate system is used, the packing and accessorial charges are authorizedand paid for by the employee from the amounts allowed for those chargesunder that system. Under the actual expense method, the accessorial andpacking charges are paid by the Government, and if those charges are high,they may more than offset any discount in the line-haul rate which maybe available for shipments by Government bill of lading. A proper comparisonof costs must take into account the line-haul transportation charge, theadministrative costs as indicated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section,and the expected accessorial and packing charges.(3) <T3>Policy. </T3>The general policy is that commuted rates shall be usedfor transportation of employees' household goods when individual transfersare involved, and that appropriate action, depending on the amount of goodsto be transported, shall be taken to estimate and compare actual expensemethod costs with commuted rate costs when groups of employees are transferredbetween the same official stations at approximately the same time so thatthe method resulting in less cost to the Government may be used. Specificprocedures to be followed are contained in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.(4) <T3>Criteria for use of the actual expense method_</T3>(i)<T3> Individual transfers. </T3>Agency experience with the actual expensemethod has shown that shipment by Government bill of lading does not resultin savings simply because a line-haul discount is available. Therefore,the commuted rate system shall be used for individual transfers withoutconsideration being given the actual expense method; except that the actualexpense method may be used if the actual costs to be incurred by the Governmentfor packing and other accessorial services are predetermined (at leastas to price per 100 pounds) and if that method is expected to result ina real savings to the Government of $100 or more. (For intrastate transfers,see paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.)(ii) <T3>Multiple transfers. </T3>Under general rate tenders arranged by GSAand the Department of Defense (DOD), participating carriers agree to transportthe household goods of Government employees at rates below commercial ratesfor specific periods of time. These tenders are arranged under 49 U.S.C.10721, and no further agency negotiation is necessary to take advantageof them. Agencies shall evaluate the use of such rates when, because ofthe transfer of several employees, they have a large volume of householdgoods to be moved between the same places at the same time even thoughno mass move is involved; however, the added costs for use of the actualexpense method, as discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and theuncertainty as to total cost for packing and accessorial services, as discussedin paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall be taken into consideration,and the actual expense method shall be selected only if it is consideredlikely that a real savings to the Government will result from the use ofthat method. (iii) <T3>Mass moves. </T3>Whenever an entire facility is being relocated orwhenever it is anticipated that 10 or more shipments of household goodsare to be transported between the same two points at approximately thesame time, the agency involved shall notify the appropriate regional orzonal office of the General Services Administration (for civilian agencieswithout specialized transportation personnel) or the appropriate transportationoffice of DOD (for components of that Department) of the forthcoming moveso that an analysis can be made of existing available rates for use underthe actual expense method. The notification shall be accompanied by allpertinent information concerning points of origin and destination, estimatedweights of property, the number of persons or different families involved,and dates or periods of time when each person or family is expected tomove. When appropriate, the GSA or DOD transportation organization shallattempt to arrange with carriers for worthwhile reduced rates and shalladvise the agency concerned of the results of such efforts. If these effortsshow that a saving will result, considering all direct and indirect costsinvolved, the actual expense method shall be used. Otherwise, the commutedrate system shall be used. (iv) <T3>Unusual circumstances. </T3>The commuted rates do not take into accountintrastate rates that in some instances may be substantially higher thanthe interstate rates that form the basis for the commuted rates. In orderto avoid the necessity of prescribing commuted rates for such circumstances,the actual expense method (Government bill of lading) may be used whenit is administratively determined that the commuted rate system would causean unusual hardship for an employee transferring between official stationswithin a State. This authority shall not be used indiscriminately, andits use shall be carefully documented and justified. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-8.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Transportation outside the continental United States.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Coverage. </T3>This section contains special rules which are applicableto the transportation of household goods at Government expense to, from,and between points outside the continental United States. Individual eligibilityis covered in Part 302-1.(b) <T3>Weight limitation. </T3>The maximum weight specified in andSection; 302-8.2is applicable; however, where furnished or partly furnished quarters areto be provided outside the continental United States (in the case of atransfer to such a station) or have been provided (in the case of a returnto the continental United States), agencies shall make an appropriate reductionin the weight of household goods which may be authorized for shipment atGovernment expense. (c) <T3>Allowable costs_</T3>(1)<T3> Actual expense basis. </T3>Transportation authorized under this sectionshall be on an actual expense basis. Actual expense includes costs of transportationof household goods, packing and crating (including packing and cratingmaterials and temporary containers), unpacking, and other necessary accessorialcharges within applicable limits. (2) <T3>Drayage. </T3>If door-to-door common carrier rates are not applicable,allowable costs include the actual costs of drayage to and from the commoncarrier for goods not in excess of the authorized weight. (3) <T3>Lift vans. </T3>Charges allowable for packing and crating and for transportationinclude expenses incurred in hiring, transporting, and packing lift vanswhen shipments are made in whole or in part by water, but do not includecharges in connection with any shipment or storage of empty lift vans orimport duties on lift vans. (4) <T3>Valuation. </T3>The valuation of property as declared for shippingwill not exceed that to which the lowest freight rates will apply exceptas provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. (d) <T3>Procedures applicable_</T3>(1)<T3> Transportation and related services. </T3>The allowable transportationand related services may be obtained by the agency concerned from any availablecommercial carrier, except that all shipments of property by water shallbe made on ships registered under the laws of the United States wheneversuch ships are available. (2) <T3>Use of Government bill of lading. </T3>Commercial shipments will bemade on Government bills of lading or purchase orders whenever possible;otherwise, reimbursement shall be made to the employee for transportationexpenses actually and necessarily incurred within the limitations prescribedby this section.(3) <T3>Itemization of charges. </T3>If the services rendered cover, in additionto transportation, other services such as packing, crating, drayage, unpacking,and temporary storage, the total charge for the services shall be itemizedto show the charge for each service. (e) <T3>Services in excess of those authorized_</T3>(1)<T3> By means other than selected. </T3>An employee may elect to have his/herhousehold goods moved by some means other than the means selected by theGovernment, except as noted in paragraph (d)(1) of this section relatingto transportation by foreign flag vessels, on the condition that he/shewill pay the amount, if any, by which the charges for the means of transportationselected by him/her exceed the charges for the means of transportationselected by the Government. (2) <T3>Excess weight. </T3>If household goods in excess of the weight allowableunder this regulation are shipped on a Government bill of lading or purchaseorder, the employee shall promptly upon completion of the shipment paythe proper agency official for the excess cost. The excess cost shall becomputed from the total charges according to the ratio of excess weightto the total weight of the shipment. (3) <T3>Excess valuation or insurance. </T3>An employee may declare a valuationabove the minimum permitted if he/she assumes all additional expenses resultingtherefrom, including the cost of insurance needed to protect the highervaluation. (See andSection; 302-8.2(e).) <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-8.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Temporary storage.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Applicability. </T3>Temporary storage of household goods at Governmentexpense may be allowable only when such storage is incident to transportationof the household goods at Government expense. (b) <T3>Allowable expenses_</T3>(1) <T3>Commuted rate system. </T3>In connection with transportation withinthe continental United States under the commuted rate system, costs oftemporary storage within the applicable weight limit will be reimbursedto the employee in the amount of his/her costs for storage including inand out charges and necessary drayage, but not to exceed the commuted ratesfor storage in the GSA publication, Commuted Rate Schedule for Transportationof Household Goods.

Grossing-up the Federal withholdingamount protects the employee from using part of his/her moving expensereimbursement to pay Federal withholding taxes. (See andSection; 302-11.7.)<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-11.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures in general.</ITAG>(a) This regulation sets forth procedures for the computation and paymentof the RIT allowance and defines agency and employee responsibilities.This regulation does not require changes to those internal fiscal proceduresestablished by the individual agencies pursuant to IRS regulations, orthe Treasury Financial Manual, provided that the intent of the statuteauthorizing the RIT allowance and this regulation are not disturbed.(b) The total amount reimbursed or paid to the employee, or on his/herbehalf, for travel, transportation, and other relocation expenses and allowancesis includable in the employee's gross income pursuant to the IRC and certainState or local government tax codes. Some moving expenses for which reimbursementsare received may be deducted from income by the employee as moving expensedeductions, subject to certain limitations prescribed by the IRS or pertinentState or local tax authorities. Reimbursements for nondeductible movingexpenses are subject to income tax. (See IRS Publication 521 entitled ``MovingExpenses'' and the appropriate State and local tax codes for detailed information.)(c) Usually, if the employee is reimbursed for nondeductible moving expenses,the amount of these reimbursements is subject to withholding of Federalincome tax in accordance with IRS regulations at the time of reimbursement.Under existing fiscal procedures, the amount of the employee's withholdingobligation is usually deducted either from reimbursements for the movingexpenses at the time of reimbursement or from the employee's salary. (SeeTreasury Financial Manual.) (d) Payment of a WTA established herein will offset deductions for theFederal income tax withholding on moving expense reimbursements, and onthe WTA itself, from the employee's moving expense reimbursements or fromsalary. (e) The total amount of the RIT allowance can be computed after the endof Year 1 as soon as the earned income level, income tax filing status,total covered taxable reimbursements, and the applicable marginal tax ratescan be determined. Employee claims for the RIT allowance should be submittedin accordance with this regulation and the employing agency's procedures.(f) Procedures are prescribed in andSection;andSection; 302-11.7 and 302-11.8for computation and payment of the WTA and the RIT allowance. These proceduresare built on existing fiscal procedures and IRS regulations regarding reportingof employee income from reimbursements and withholding of taxes on supplementalwages.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-11.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for determining the WTA in Year 1.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General rules. </T3>The WTA is designed to cover only the employee'swithholding tax obligation for Federal income taxes on income resultingfrom covered moving expense reimbursements. (See definition in andSection;302-11.5(c).) Other withholding tax obligations, if any, such as for socialsecurity taxes or for State and/or local income taxes on income resultingfrom moving expense reimbursements shall not be included in the calculationof the WTA payment. The amount of the WTA is equal to the Federal incometax withholding obligation incurred by the employee on covered moving expensereimbursements (which are not offset by deductible moving expenses) andon the WTA itself. Each time covered moving expense reimbursements arepaid to or on behalf of the employee, the WTA shall be calculated, accountedfor, and reported as provided in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.(b) <T3>Determination of amount of reimbursement subject to withholding. </T3>UnderIRS regulations, income resulting from reimbursements for nondeductiblemoving expenses is subject to withholding of Federal income taxes. (SeeIRS Publication 521, ``Moving Expenses.'') There are some moving expenseswhich may be reimbursed but are not covered taxable reimbursements (seedefinition in andSection; 302-11.5(d)) for purposes of the WTA and RIT allowancecalculations, such as nontemporary storage of household goods. (See exclusionsin andSection; 302-11.4.) Therefore, the actual amount of the covered taxablereimbursements may be different than the amount of nondeductible movingexpenses subject to Federal income tax withholding. The difference in theseamounts should not be substantial; therefore, the amount of nondeductiblemoving expenses subject to Federal income tax withholding, as determinedby the agency pursuant to IRS regulations, may be used in calculating theWTA. (Note that the RIT calculation procedure in andSection; 302-11.8 requiresdetermination of covered taxable reimbursements.) (c) <T3>Determination of Federal withholding tax rate (FWTR). </T3>Becausemoving expense reimbursements constitute supplemental wages for Federalincome tax purposes, the 20 percent flat rate of withholding is generallyapplicable to income generated by such reimbursements. The 20 percent rateshould be used in calculating the WTA unless under an agency's internalfiscal (withholding) procedures a different withholding rate is used pursuantto IRS tax regulations. In such cases, the applicable withholding rateshall be substituted for the 20 percent rate in the calculation shown inparagraph (d) of this section.(d) <T3>Calculation of the WTA. </T3>The WTA is calculated by substitutingthe amounts determined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, intothe WTA gross-up formula shown below:<ITAG tagnum="26">Formula:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,1,1,3,3</C> <H1>Y</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>X</H1><H2>1^X</H2><H1>(N)</H1> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Y=WTA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=FWTR (generally, 20 percent)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N=nondeductible moving expenses/covered taxable reimbursements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Example:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">If:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=20 percent</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N=$21,800</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Then:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,1,1,9,9</C> <H1>Y</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>.20</H1><H2>1.00^.20</H2><H1>($21,800)</H1> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Y=.25 ($21,800)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Y=$5,450</ITAG>(e) <T3>WTA payment and employee agreement for repayment. </T3>(1) The WTAmay be calculated several times within Year 1 if reimbursements for movingexpenses are made on more than one travel voucher. Each time an employeeis reimbursed for moving expenses which are subject to Federal tax withholdingin accordance with the IRS regulations, the WTA will be calculated andpaid unless the employee fails to comply with the requirements in paragraph(e)(2) of this section.(2) The employee shall be required to agree in writing to repay any excessamount paid to him/her in Year 1 (see andSection;andSection; 302-11.8(f)(4)and 302-11.9(b)(3)), and submit the required certified tax informationand claim for his/her RIT allowance within a reasonable length of time(as determined by the agency) after the close of Year 1. Failure of theemployee to comply with this requirement will preclude the agency's paymentof the WTA. The entire WTA will be considered an excess payment if theRIT allowance claim is not submitted in a timely manner to settle the RITallowance account.(f) <T3>Determination of employee's withholding tax on WTA. </T3>Since theamount of the WTA is considered income to the employee, it is subject tothe same tax withholding requirements as all other moving expense reimbursements.(See Treasury Financial Manual, Section 4080, Moving Expense Reimbursements,for withholding requirements.)(g) <T3>End of year reporting. </T3>At the end of the year, agencies generallyare required to issue IRS Form(s) W-2 for each employee showing total grosscompensation (including moving expense reimbursements) and the applicableamount of Federal taxes withheld. For tax reporting purposes, the WTA isto be treated as a moving expense reimbursement. The total amount of theemployee's WTA's paid during the year as well as the amount of moving expensereimbursements should be included as income on the employee's Form W-2.The Federal tax withholding amount applicable to the moving expense reimbursementsand the WTA should also be included on the employee's Form W-2. The amountof the WTA's also will be furnished to the employee along with the amountof moving expense reimbursements on IRS Form 4782 or another itemized listingprovided for the employee's use in preparing his/her tax return (see IRSregulations for further guidance) and in claiming the RIT allowance asprovided in andSection; 302-11.8. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-11.8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Rules and procedures for determining the RIT allowance in Year 2.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Summary/overview of procedures. </T3>The RIT allowance will be calculatedand claimed in Year 2. This can be accomplished as soon as the employeecan determine earned income (as defined herein), income tax filing status,covered taxable reimbursements for Year 1, and the applicable marginaltax rates. The RIT allowance is then calculated using the gross-up formulaunder procedures prescribed herein. Since the RIT allowance is consideredincome, appropriate withholding taxes on the RIT allowance are deductedand the balance constitutes the net payment to the employee. Rules, procedures,and the prescribed tax tables for these calculations are provided in paragraphs(b) through (g) of this section, and in Appendices A, B, and C of thisPart 302-11.(b) <T3>General rules and assumptions. </T3>(1) The procedures prescribed hereinfor calculations and payment of the RIT allowance are based on certainassumptions jointly developed by GSA and IRS, and tax tables developedby IRS. This approach avoids a potentially controversial and administrativelyburdensome procedure requiring the employee to furnish extensive documentation,such as certified copies of actual tax returns and reconstructed returns,in support of a claim for a RIT allowance payment. Specifically, the followingassumptions have been made: (i) The employee will claim allowable moving expense deductions for thesame tax year in which the corresponding moving expense reimbursementsare included in income; (ii) Changes to the IRC, applicable to the 1987 and subsequent tax years,require that allowable moving expense deductions must be taken as an itemizeddeduction from gross income rather than as an adjustment to gross incomeas in previous tax years. It is assumed that employees will receive thebenefit of allowable moving expense deductions to offset income eitherby itemizing their moving expense deductions or through the increased standarddeductions.(iii) Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it was assumed that the employee's(and spouse's, if a joint return is filed) earned income, filing status,and CMTR determined for Year 1 (and used in determining the RIT allowancein Year 2) would remain the same or would not be substantially differentin the second and subsequent tax years. However, the Tax Reform Act of1986 substantially changed the Federal tax rates. Until the transitionto the new tax rates is completed, it is necessary to compute a separateCMTR for Year 1 and for Year 2. (See paragraph (e) of this section.) Theformula for calculating any RIT allowances to be paid in 1988, which isunchanged from 1987, is shown in paragraph (f) of this section. It is assumedthat within the accuracy of the calculation, the State and local tax ratesfor Year 1 and Year 2 will remain the same or will not be substantiallydifferent. Therefore, the State and local tax rates for Year 1 shall beused in calculating the CMTR for Year 2.(2) The prescribed procedures, which yield an estimate of an employee'sadditional tax liability due to moving expense reimbursements, are to beused uniformly. They are not to be adjusted to accommodate an employee'sunique circumstance which may differ from the assumed circumstances statedin paragraph (b)(1) of this section.(3) An adjustment of the RIT allowance paid in Year 2 for the covered taxablereimbursements received in Year 1 is required if the tax information certifiedto on the RIT allowance claim is different than that shown on the actualFederal tax return filed with IRS for Year 1 or changed for any reasonafter filing of the tax return, so as to affect the CMTR's used in theRIT allowance calculation. (See andSection; 302-11.10 for claims procedures.)(c) <T3>Determination of covered taxable reimbursements. </T3>(1) Generally,the amount of the covered taxable reimbursements is the difference between(i) the amount of covered moving expense reimbursements for the allowanceslisted in andSection; 302-11.3 that was included in the employee's incomein Year 1, and (ii) the maximum amount of allowable moving expenses thatmay be claimed as a moving expense deduction by the employee on his/herFederal tax return under IRS tax regulations to offset the income resultingfrom moving expense reimbursements for Year 1. The covered taxable reimbursementswill be determined as if the employee had itemized and deducted all allowablemoving expense deductions. (See assumption made in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)of this section.) If the employee is precluded from claiming moving expensedeductions because he/she does not meet IRS requirements for the distancetest, then the amount of covered taxable reimbursements is the same asthe amount of covered moving expense reimbursements. (See andSection; 302-11.5(d).)(2) For purposes of calculating the RIT allowance, the following specialrules apply to the determination of moving expense deductions to offsetmoving expense reimbursements reported as income:(i) The total amount of reimbursement (which was reported as income) forthe expenses of en route travel for the employee and family (see andSection;302-11.3(a)) and transportation (including up to 30 days temporary storage)of household goods (see andSection; 302-11.3(b)) to the new official stationshall be used as a moving expense deduction. (See also andSection; 302-11.4(e) and (f).)(ii) The total amount of reimbursement for a househunting trip, temporaryquarters (up to 30 days at new station) and real estate transaction expenses(see andSection; 302-11.3 (e), (f), (g), and (i)), up to the maximum allowablededuction under IRS tax regulations, shall be used as a moving expensededuction. For example, an employee and spouse filing a joint return andresiding in the same household at the end of the tax year may deduct upto $3,000 for these expenses. (No more than $1,500 of the $3,000 may beclaimed for a househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses combined.)If the employee was reimbursed $1,350 for a househunting trip and temporaryquarters expenses and $9,000 for real estate expenses, the moving expensedeductions would be $1,350 for the househunting trip and temporary quartersexpenses and $1,650 for real estate expenses. If the employee's reimbursementwas $1,850 for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and$9,000 for real estate expenses, the moving expense deductions would be$1,500 for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and $1,500for real estate expenses. If the employee had no reimbursement for a househuntingtrip and temporary quarters, the full $3,000 would be applied to the $9,000reimbursement for real estate expenses. (See IRS Publication 521, ``MovingExpenses,'' for these and other maximums which vary by situation and filingstatus.)(3) Procedures and examples are provided herein as if all moving expensereimbursements are received in one year with all moving expense deductionsapplied in that same year to arrive at the covered taxable reimbursements.However, when reimbursements span more than one year, the amount of coveredtaxable reimbursements must be determined separately for each reimbursementyear (Year 1). The maximum moving expense deductions apply to the entiremove. Under IRS tax regulations, the employee has some discretion as towhen he/she claims these deductions (e.g., in the year of the move whenthe expense was paid or in the year of reimbursement, if these actionsdo not occur in the same year). However, for purposes of the RIT allowanceprocedures, the moving expense deductions will be applied in the year thatthe corresponding reimbursement is made. For example, if an employee incurredand was reimbursed $1,000 for a househunting trip and temporary quartersin 1986 and an additional $1,000 for temporary quarters in 1987, this employee,according to his/her particular situation and tax filing status, may deduct$1,500 of these expenses in moving expense deductions. In calculating theRIT allowance for 1986, $1,000 of the $1,500 deduction is used to offsetthe $1,000 reimbursement in 1986 resulting in zero covered taxable reimbursementsfor the househunting trip and temporary quarters for 1986. The remaining$500 (balance of the $1,500 not used in determining covered taxable reimbursementsfor 1986) will be used to offset the $1,000 temporary quarters reimbursementin 1987 (second Year 1), leaving $500 of the temporary quarters reimbursementas a covered taxable reimbursement for 1987.(4) Although the WTA amount is included in income (see andSection; 302-11.7),it shall not be included in the amount of covered taxable reimbursements.Under the procedures and formulas established herein, the proper amountof the RIT allowance is calculated using the RIT gross-up formula withthe WTA and any prior RIT allowance payments excluded from covered taxablereimbursements.(5) Agencies are cautioned that there may be moving expenses reimbursedto the employee that are not covered by the RIT allowance. (See exclusionsin andSection; 302-11.4; also see discussion in andSection; 302-11.7 regardingcovered taxable reimbursements versus nondeductible expenses.)(6) An example showing how to calculate covered taxable reimbursementsis illustrated in Figure 302-11(a).(d) <T3>Determination of income level and filing status. </T3>In order to determinethe CMTR's needed to calculate the RIT allowance, the employee must determinethe appropriate amount of earned income (as prescribed herein) that wasor will be reported on his/her Federal tax return for the tax year in whichthe covered taxable reimbursements were received (Year 1). Such amountwill also include the spouse's earned income if a joint filing status isclaimed. For purposes of this regulation, appropriate earned income shallinclude only the amount of gross compensation reported on IRS Form(s) W-2,and, if applicable, the net earnings (or loss) from self-employment incomeas shown on Schedule SE of IRS Form 1040. (See andSection; 302-11.5(h).)(Note that moving expense reimbursements including the WTA amounts andany RIT allowance paid for a prior Year 1 are to be included in earnedincome and should be shown as income on the Form W-2; if they are not,other appropriate documentation shall be furnished by the agency.) (SeeandSection; 302-11.7(g).) The amount of earned income as determined underthis paragraph (d) and the tax filing status (for example, from lines 1through 5 on the 1987 IRS Form 1040) shall be contained in a certifiedstatement on, or attached to, the voucher claiming the RIT allowance. (SeeandSection; 302-11.10.) If a joint filing status is claimed and the spouse'searned income is included, the spouse must sign the certified statement.If the spouse does not sign the statement, earned income will include onlythe employee's earned income and the RIT allowance will be calculated onthat basis. This condition will not apply if an employee is allowed, underIRS rules, to file a joint return as a surviving spouse.(e) <T3>Determination of the CMTR's. </T3>The gross-up formula used to calculatethe RIT allowance in paragraph (f) of this section, requires the use oftwo CMTR's_one for Year 1 in which reimbursements were received and theother for Year 2 in which the RIT allowance is paid. CMTR's are singletax rates calculated to represent the Federal, State, and/or local incometax rates applicable to the earned income determined for Year 1. (See paragraph(d) of this section.) The CMTR's will be determined as follows:(1) <T3>Federal marginal tax rates. </T3>The Federal marginal tax rates forYear 1 and Year 2 are determined by using the income level and filing statusdetermined under paragraph (d) of this section and contained in the certifiedstatement by the employee (or employee and spouse) on the RIT allowanceclaim, and applying the prescribed Federal tax tables contained in AppendicesA and C of this Part 302-11. For example, if the income level for the 1987tax year (Year 1) was $65,000 for a married employee filing a Federal jointreturn, the Federal marginal tax rate would be 35 percent for Year 1 (1987)(see Appendix A of this Part 302-11) and 28 percent for Year 2 (1988) (seeAppendix C of this Part 302-11). These rates would be used regardless ofhow much of the $65,000 was attributable to reimbursement for the employee'srelocation expenses. (Note that these marginal rates are different fromthe withholding tax rate used for the WTA.) If the employee incurs onlyFederal income tax (i.e., there are no State or local taxes), the Federalmarginal tax rates determined from Appendices A and C of this Part 302-11are the CMTR's to be used in the RIT gross-up formula provided in andSection;302-11.8(f). In such cases, the provisions of paragraphs (e) (2) and (3)of this section, do not apply.(2) <T3>State marginal tax rate. </T3>(i) If the employee incurs an additionalState income tax (see definition in andSection; 302-11.5(a)) liability asa result of moving expense reimbursements, the appropriate State tax tablein Appendix B of this Part 302-11 is to be used to determine the applicableState marginal tax rate that will be substituted into the formula for determiningthe CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2. The appropriate State tax table willbe the one that corresponds to the tax year in which the reimbursementsare paid to the employee (Year 1). The income level determined in paragraph(d) of this section for Federal taxes shall be used to identify the appropriateincome bracket in the State tax table. The applicable State marginal taxrate is obtained from the selected income bracket column for the Statewhere the employee is required to pay State income tax on moving expensereimbursements. The tax rates shown in the table apply to all employeesregardless of their filing status, except where a separate rate is shownfor a single filing status.(ii) The lowest income bracket shown in the State tax tables in AppendixB of this Part 302-11 is $20,000-$24,999. In cases where the employee's(employee's and spouse's, if filing jointly) earned income as determinedunder paragraph (d) of this section is less than this income bracket, anappropriate State marginal tax rate shall be established by the employingagency from the applicable State tax code or regulations issued pursuantthereto. Such State marginal tax rate shall be representative of the earnedincome level in question but in no case more than the marginal tax rateestablished in Appendix B of this Part 302-11 for the $20,000-$24,999 incomebracket for the particular State in which an additional tax obligationhas been incurred.(iii) The prescribed State marginal tax rates generally are expressed asa percent of taxable income. However, if the applicable State marginaltax rate is stated as a percentage of the Federal income tax liability,the State tax rate must be converted to a percent of taxable income tobe used in the CMTR formulas in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Thisis accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal tax rate for Year1 by the applicable State tax rate. For example, if the Federal tax rateis 35 percent for Year 1 and the State tax rate is 25 percent of the Federalincome tax liability, the State tax rate stated as a percent of taxableincome would be 8.75 percent. The State tax rate thus determined for Year1 will be used in determining the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2.(iv) An employee may incur a State income tax liability on moving expensereimbursements in more than one State at the same or different marginaltax rates. Nevertheless, a single State marginal tax rate must be determinedfor use in the CMTR formulas in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The followinggeneral rules shall apply in determining the applicable single rate: (A) In the tax year during which the transfer actually takes place, theemployee may incur a State income tax obligation at both the old and newlocation. However, most moving expense reimbursements will be taxed atthe new location. Although the employee may receive some reimbursements(e.g., for a househunting trip) prior to the actual transfer which wouldbe credited as income at the old location, these types of expenses generallyare tax deductible and would not generate an additional State tax liabilityfor the employee. In addition, procedures inherent in the travel voucherreimbursement system tend to cause most reimbursements which may be taxableto occur after the actual transfer. Therefore, the State marginal tax ratedetermined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section forthe new location will be used in the CMTR formulas.(B) There may be other situations where the employee is subject to taxeson moving expense reimbursements in two States, for instance, in one Statebecause of State residency and in another because a particular State taxesincome earned within its jurisdiction irrespective of whether the employeeis a resident. If the two States involved recognize such situations byallowing an adjustment or credit for taxes paid to the other State, theemployee's State marginal tax rate for the State where income tax on movingexpense reimbursements is actually paid will be determined and used inthe CMTR formulas. However, in those situations where there is, in fact,double taxation on income from moving expense reimbursements and the taxesimposed by both States qualify as a State income tax (as defined in andSection;302-11.5(a)), the sum of the State marginal tax rates for the two Statesas determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (iii) of this sectionshall be used in the CMTR formulas.(3) <T3>Local marginal tax rate. </T3>Because of the impracticality of establishinga single marginal tax rate table for local income taxes that could be applieduniformly on a nationwide basis, appropriate local marginal tax rates shallbe determined as provided in paragraphs (e)(3) (i) through (iii) of thissection.(i) If the employee incurs an additional local income tax (see definitionandSection; 302-11.5(b)) liability as a result of moving expense reimbursements,he/she shall certify to such fact when claiming the RIT allowance (seecertification statement in andSection; 302-11.10) by specifying the nameof the locality imposing the income tax and the applicable marginal taxrate determined from the actual marginal tax rate table or schedule prescribedby the taxing locality. The marginal tax rate shall be the one applicableto the taxable income portion of the amount of earned income determinedunder paragraph (d) of this section for the employee (and spouse, if filingjointly). The same tax rate shall be used in calculating the CMTR for bothYear 1 and Year 2. The employing agency shall establish procedures to determinewhether the employee-certified local marginal tax rate is appropriate forthe employee's income level and filing status and approve its use in theCMTR formulas. (See also andSection; 302-11.10(b)(2).) (ii) If the local marginal tax rate is stated as a percentage of Federalor State income tax liability, such rate must be converted to a percentof taxable income for use in the CMTR formulas. This is accomplished bymultiplying the applicable Federal or State tax rate for Year 1 as determinedin paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section by the applicable local taxrate. For example, if the State tax rate for Year 1 is 6 percent and thelocal tax rate is 50 percent of State income tax liability, the local taxrate stated as a percentage of taxable income would be 3 percent. The localtax rate thus determined for Year 1 will be used in determining the CMTRfor both Year 1 and Year 2.(iii) The situations described in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this sectionwith respect to State income taxes may also be encountered with local incometaxes.

Such services include, but need not be limitedto, arranging for the purchase of a transferred employee's residence. Agenciesexercising this discretionary authority shall carry out their responsibilitiesunder 5 U.S.C. 5724c within the guidelines of this directive. These guidelinesare issued under the authority delegated to the Administrator of GeneralServices by Executive Order 12466 dated February 27, 1984. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-12.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>The Government recognizes every dollar spent on the relocation of civilianemployees as a cost of doing business that should specifically be directedtowards meeting the highest priority needs of the agency's mission andits programs. Use of authorized relocation services may provide agencieswith a vehicle to improve the treatment of employees who are directed torelocate and thereby facilitate retention of well-qualified employees.To the extent that these services and the increased relocation entitlementsand allowance maximums increase the overall cost of relocations, agenciesmay find it necessary to reassess their relocation policies and practicesbecause increased costs may further limit the number of employees thatcan be relocated. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-12.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Agency responsibilities.</ITAG>It is the responsibility of each agency head, or his/her designee, to determinewhether, to what extent, and under what conditions relocation serviceswill be made available to employees transferring within the agency andthose transferred between agencies. This determination will be made basedon an analysis of the agency's relocation needs, availability of funds,and in accordance with these guidelines. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-12.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General conditions and limitations for eligibility.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Employees covered. </T3>Relocation services may be made available toemployees only when both of the following conditions are met: (1) The employee's transfer from one official station to another is determinedto be in the interest of the Government and is not primarily for the convenienceor benefit of the employee or at his/her request; and (2) The effective date of the employee's transfer is on or after November14, 1983 (the effective date of transfer is the date the employee reportsfor duty at the new official station as provided in andSection; 302-1.4(k)).(b) <T3>Persons excluded from coverage. </T3>The provisions of this Part 302-12are not applicable to the following individuals/employees: (1) New appointees, including those covered under andSection; 302-1.11 (i.e.,new appointees to shortage category and Senior Executive Service positionsand Presidential appointees); (2) Employees assigned under the Government Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C.4109); or (3) Employees assigned or transferred to or from a post of duty in a foreignarea. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-12.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedural requirements and controls.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Employee option. </T3>Employees offered use of relocation servicesby their agencies should be given the option to accept or reject the offer.(b) <T3>Dual benefit prohibited. </T3>Once an employee is offered, and decidesto use, the services of a relocation company, reimbursement to the employeeshall not be allowed for expenses authorized under this Chapter 302, Parts302-1 through 302-10, that are analogous or similar to expenses or thecost for services that the agency will pay for under the relocation servicecontract. (c) <T3>Service agreements. </T3>The employee must have signed a service agreementas required in andSection; 302-1.5. In the event the employee violates theterms of the agreement, the Government reserves the right to recover fromthe employee any and all payments made to the relocation company on theemployee's behalf. (d) <T3>Ineligible individuals. </T3>Agencies should not make payments to relocationcompanies that will benefit ineligible individuals. For example, wherejoint ownership of a residence exists between an eligible transferringemployee and a non-government employee, the benefits derived from relocationservices could accrue equally to the ineligible party. This type of situationis addressed for direct reimbursements of real estate expenses under andSection;302-6.1(f); similar provisions should be made for relocation service contracts.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-12.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Form and scope of relocation service contracts.</ITAG>Once a decision has been made by the agency to enter into contracts toprovide relocation services to its employees (see andSection;andSection; 302-12.3and 302-12.4), the agency shall recognize the following: (a) <T3>General considerations. </T3>(1) Contracts for relocation servicesshall be awarded through a competitive process to ensure compliance withprocurement law and attain the best possible service to meet a particularagency's relocation needs at the least cost to the agency. Agencies shouldattempt to assure that adequate geographic coverage exists. (2) Relocation companies offer a wide variety of services to assist therelocating employee. Subject to these regulatory guidelines, each agencywill determine through its contracts with the relocation companies theexact nature of the services to be offered its employees. Since the useof relocation companies could entail costs substantially in excess of thoseauthorized in this Chapter 302, Parts 302-1 through 302-10, agencies shouldexercise prudent management discretion when deciding which relocation servicesshould be included in the contracts. (b) <T3>Requirement that contracts not violate other regulatory or statutoryprovisions. </T3>(1) GSA has established certain travel and transportationprograms that agencies are required to use. Examples are the centralizedhousehold goods traffic management program, the airline services contracts,and travel management center contracts. While similar services may be offeredby relocation companies, agencies cannot use them. However, this restrictiondoes not prohibit agencies from incorporating the GSA centralized householdgoods traffic management program, as a mandatory services source, intocontracts with relocation service companies. Thus, relocation companiesmay act as third-party service firms to administer GSA's centralized householdgoods traffic management program on behalf of the contracting agency. (2) Federal agencies should ensure that contracts with relocation companiesthat are on a cost reimbursable basis include only those services thatare analogous to the allowable expenses authorized in this Chapter 302,and that the payments for such services are limited to the maximum amountsspecified in this Chapter 302. Agencies must recognize that the statuteand the provisions of this Chapter 302 contain certain limitations andrestrictions which are not overridden by the new authority for relocationservices. For example, the law: (i) Prohibits payment for market losses. The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5724a(a)(4),which authorize reimbursement for the expenses of the sale and purchaseof employee's residence also provide that ``reimbursement may not be madefor losses on the sale of the residence.'' As implemented in andSection;302-6.2(e), losses due to failure to sell a residence at the old officialstation at the price asked, at its current appraised value, or at its originalcost, or due to failure to buy a dwelling at the new official station ata price comparable to the selling price at the old official station, andany similar losses, are not reimbursable. (ii) Does not provide for payment of mortgage interest differentials. Amortgage interest differential is the difference between the interest rateof the mortgage on the residence at the old official station and the interestrate of the mortgage on the residence being purchased at the new officialstation. (iii) Does not authorize purchase of an employee's home. The law (5 U.S.C.5724c) authorizes agencies to enter into contracts for relocation servicesand provides that such services may include ``arranging for the purchaseof a transferred employee's residence.'' However, it does not authorizethe Government to become a homeowner either by direct purchase of the homefrom the employee or by taking title to the employee's home through therelocation company. (c) <T3>Advantages of flat-fee contracts. </T3>If a relocation company agreesto accept the responsibilities of ownership for the transferred employee'sresidence after payment of a one-time flat fee by an agency, it would beoffering a service clearly distinguishable from those discussed in paragraph(b)(2) of this section. Once the flat fee is established, it is paid insteadof the actual expenses that normally would be paid by an agency under acost reimbursable contract. This type of arrangement is advantageous inthat it limits the Government's financial obligation and simplifies administrativeprocedures in accounting for costs. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302-12.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Income tax consequences of using relocation companies.</ITAG>In entering into contracts with relocation companies, agencies should considerthe income tax consequences for the employee. Certain payments on behalfof the employee to a relocation company may constitute taxable income tothe employee, depending on the specific terms of the contract. Under theprovisions of 5 U.S.C. 5724b, additional taxes resulting from such incomewould be covered by the relocation income tax allowance as provided inPart 302-11. For further information relating to the income tax consequencesof payments to relocation companies, agencies should contact the InternalRevenue Service, 111 Constitution Avenue, NW., (CC:IND:I) Room 5019, Washington,DC 20224.<ITAG tagnum="76">CHAPTER 303_PAYMENT OF EXPENSES CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH OF CERTAINEMPLOYEES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Part 303-1 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Part 303-2 Allowances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">CHAPTER 303_PAYMENT OF EXPENSES CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH OF CERTAINEMPLOYEES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 303-1_GENERAL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">303-1.1 Authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">303-1.2 Responsibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">303-1.3 Death related to performance of official duty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">303-1.4 Method of payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">303-1.5 Death during period of absence from duty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">303-1.6 Escort for remains.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 5721-5734, 5741-5742; E.O. 11609, July 22,1971 (36 FR 13747).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 303-1.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Authority.</ITAG>This Chapter 303 sets forth the allowable expenses, not otherwise providedfor by law, authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5742(b) for the preparation and transportationof the remains of a deceased employee, and by 5 U.S.C. 5722 (see andSection;303-2.6) for the transportation of the immediate family and household goodsof a deceased employee.
