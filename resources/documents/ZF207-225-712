(800) 873-4384.andP;  Version: 1.2.2Compatibility: 512KE or later.andP;  Application Size: 40K Copy Protection: NoneandM;Sometimes success can be its own worst enemy.andP;  As anyone in show businessknows, there's nothing tougher than following a hit.andP;  Take Suitecase, forexample.andP;  The original was so good that it practically became a necessity.andO;But now there's Suitcase II -- which is even better.andP;  Unfortunately, theaudience has become more sophisticated, so it's a lot harder to impress.andO;Nevertheless, Suitcase II deserves to be a hit.andM;The biggest improvement in Suitcase II is in its increased file-managementpower.andP;  Rather than recognizing specific filenames such as Fonts, DAs, Fkeys,and Fonts/DAs, Suitcase II remembers any font, DA, sound, or Fkey file youopen on any available disk and reopens it for you next time, regardless ofits name.andP;  And assuming you have the RAM, you can now open up to 99 suchfiles.andM;The original Suitcase displayed only desk accessories in the Suitcase DAwindow, but Suitcase II lists the contents of any font, DA, Fkey, or soundfile if you click on the appropriate button.andM;When displaying fonts, Suitcase II shows you any font in an open font file inany size of style.andP;  Just select it and click on the Show button ordouble-click on the font name.andP;  This window also tells you the name of ascreen font's matching downloadable printer-font file if it has one.andP;  Thisinformation is a big help for people who have inadvertently changed the namesof their downloadable font files.andP;  And you can keep those downloadable fontsin any folder or disk that contains a font file opened by Suitcase II.andP;  Plusyou can share them across a network.andM;And if you prefer seeing Font menu lists in their own typefaces, Suitcase IIcan provide them, either all the time or only when you hold down a modifier(Option, Shift, or Command) key while opening the Font menu.andP;  Since it takesa while for Suitcase II to read through all open font files to create such amenu, I prefer to press the modifier key only when I need this feature.andP;  Youcan even choose which modifier you prefer to use.andM;You can rename only DA or sound and rename or renumber any Fkey from SuitcaseII's window, and you can hve your most frequently used items at the top ofthe list or in alphbetical order.andP;  And when you're in MultiFinder, you canhold down the modifier key to suppress you DA list, making more room for theapplication list at the bottom.andP;  Suitcase II remains at the top of the list,however, in case you need to select a DA.andM;Previous versions of Suitcase warned against opening or closing font filesfrom within applications, because most applications create their Font menu atthe time you open them and do not update them in response to newly opened orclosed font files.andP;  I have tried closing font files while in Microsoft Worksand found that although Zapf Chancery was still listed on my Font menu, thecopy on-screen deteriorated into Geneva once the file was closed.andP;  When Ihighlighted it and reselected Zapf Chancery from the menu, nothing happened.andM;This version can update Font menus dynamically in applications that canaccept the new font information -- a nice idea, but more applications willhave to be upgraded to accept the update information before this featurebecomes useful.andM;Two utility applications come with Suitcase II: Font Harmony, and Font andamp;Sound Valet.andP;  Font Harmony solves a major problem that has plagued Mac fonthandling.andP;  Many applications refer to fonts by their ID number.andP;  BeforeSuitcase, all fonts had to be installed in the System file.andP;  Font/DA Moverautomatically renumbered any font whose number matched a font alreadyinstalled, so no two fonts could have the same number.andP;  Suitcase changed allthat, because multiple files could now be opened.andP;  Different fonts could havethe same number if they were in different files, so you could select one fontfrom your Font menu, only to have a different one (unexpectedly) show upon-screen or at your printer.andM;Font Harmony resolves font-numbering conflicts among many font files.andP;  Openthem all within Font Harmony and click on the Harmonize button.andP;  Font Harmonyexamines all fonts in all open files and makes certain that each has a uniqueID number.andP;  The Check/Fix button checks font files for the correct fileformat and makes the necessary corrections.andM;A second font-handling problem on the Mac is that it automatically createsbold, italics, and other styles in the Style menu by altering the regularscreen fonts.andP;  From a typesetter's point of view, Helvetica Italic is not thesame as a slanted version of regular Helvetica, however.andP;  For propertypography, you need separate screen fonts and downloadable printer fonts foreach style.andP;  This necessity has led to a congested Font menu (Bodoni Laser,Bodoni Italic, Bodoni Bold, Bodoni Bold Italic).andM;Font Harmony can combine all the members of a font family into a singlelisting (e.g., Bodoni) on the Font menu, thus making the Font menu smallerand less confusing.andP;  You can access the correct downloadable printer font byselecting Italic, Bold, or both from the Style menu.andM;A menu item lets you choose whether or not to include condensed and extendedfonts when combining families.andP;  Your choice depends on whether theapplications you are using have those choices in their Style menu.andO;(Page-Maker does not have them; Ready,-Set, Go! does.)andM;I'm concerned about nonstandard font storage.andP;  Someone who has combinedfamilies including condensed and extended will lose the ability to access thecondensed and extended styles in any application that doesn't have those menuitems.andP;  In fact, if your menus don't have those choices, there is no way toknow whether your font files contain those styles.andP;  Therefore, although Ihighly recommend using Font Harmony to resolve numbering conflicts, I believeyou should carefully weigh your own situation before combining families.andM;Since the majority of applications don't have separate Style menu listingsfor condensed and extended type, I suggest you exclude those styles if youdecide to combine families, and keep copies of the uncombined fonts in caseyou change your mind.andM;With so many fonts, DAs, sounds, and Fkeys available, disk space has becomeever more valuable.andP;  Font andamp; Sound Valet compresses font and sound files tomake them smaller on disk, and Suitcase II can use the compressed filesdirectly -- actually, it decompresses them in RAM.andP;  Like combining fontfamilies, this change is fine as long as the compressed fonts and soundsremain with someone who knows they have been altered.andP;  Friends who don't haveSuitcase II, however, will not be able to use them.andM;I tested Suitcase II, version 1.2.2.andP;  Everything in the Suitcase II packageworked exactly as I wished.andP;  The Suitcase II window is a joy to operate,mostly because of its utter simplicity.andP;  As a previous Suitcase user, Ijumped right into this new version without even thinking about it.andP;  I testedthis version on several network installations and found no compatibilityproblems.andM;The manual is clearly written.andP;  In addition to describing the operation ofSuitcase II, Font Harmony, and Font andamp; Sound Valet, it provides a step-by-steptroubleshooting section.andM;Suitcase II may be riding a major hit's coattails, but this is one sequelthat's a hit on its own.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
