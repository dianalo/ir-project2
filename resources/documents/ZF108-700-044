(ERC) of Toronto estimates that the overall Canadianprinter market, excluding aftermarket sales, to be worth $538.1 million atmanufacturers' level on shipments of 790,200 units in 1989.andP;  Shipments areexpected to increase 15 per cent annually through 1993.andM;But printers have been changing their look over the last 10 years.andM;Throughout the early to mid-1980s, impact printers (those that involvephysical contact of a print mechanism to paper) came in two forms: the&quot;rat-a-tat-tat&quot; of character printers such as the daisy wheel and themonotone whine of dot matrix technology.andM;But today's printer are much quieter, much faster and more versatile thantheir predecessors.andP;  Known as non-impact technologies, they include laserprinters and thermal printers.andM;Ahearn andamp; Soper's Peter Fedak says that this year, impact and non-impactprinters have an equal share of the market.andP;  But the non-impact side isgrowing much faster and replacing impact technology.andM;&quot;By 1995, it will be 75 percent to 2k per cent in favor of non-impactprinters,&quot; he says.andM;According to Computer Intelligence, a breakdown of 1989 U.S.andP;  computerspecialty store printer sales by technology was as follows: impact printers(66.3 per cent), laser printers (20.7 per cent) and inkjet and solid fontprinters (13 per cent).andM;Hewlett-Packard, said to be the market leader in the non-impact printermarket, is focusing its efforts in the world of Apple computers.andM;&quot;Until recently, Apple was supplied by Apple peripherals,&quot; says LorraineMcDonald, marketing manager at Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Ltd. of Mississauga,Ont.andM;The company recently announced that Macintosh users, whose computer areconnected to AppleTalk networks, can use the HP DeskWriter printer.andM;The enhanced HP DeskWriter offers AppleTalk and serial interfaces andreplaces the original HP DeskWriter printer, which had only a serialinterface.andP;  Price is about $1,700.andM;Macintosh users can also choose from HP's LaserJet III, IID and IIP printers,to be available in Macintosh versions in the second quarter of 1990.andM;Robert Owens, manager of marketing communication at QMS Inc. in Mobile, Ala.,andO;finds that customers want more functionality out of their printers -- moreconnectivity as a standard feature and more speed -- all at a lower listprice.andM;&quot;The next generation of laser printers...will have a high-speed processorthat will crunch data faster than ever before,&quot; says Owens.andM;But color printing seems to be the big drawing card.andM;David Kovachik, manager of the copy product division at Toronto's KodakCanada Inc., says that users now have access to software with full-colorsupport for everything from desktop publishing to desktop presentations.andM;&quot;Any user who needs to work with color and has access to a PC or CRT (cathoderay tube) can display 16 to 256 or more colors at one time,&quot; says Kovachik.andO;&quot;We even have full-color original in 60 seconds.&quot;andM;At the recent Dataquest Conference in Palm Springs, Calif., Eastman KodakCo.'s Thomas Gribb said that there are several barriers that prevent thewidespread use of color printers in today's offices.andM;Color electronic priters are too slow for on-demand publishing applicationand mainframe graphics, says Gribb.andP;  The cost is too high as well -- 50 to 75cents per copy for current color printers.andM;Then there is poor image quality, since today's color printers are unable toproduce text that is as black and sharp as that produced by high-endblack-and-white printers, and they cannot be printed on plain bond paper.andM;Finally, incompatibility is caused by the lack of a color page descriptionlanguage (PDL) as well as a standard for color definition.andM;&quot;Today there are many options available, but the industry has not agreed on asingle standard,&quot; says Gribb, director of program market planning in theRochester, N.Y.-based company's copy product division.andP;  &quot;Without thatstandard, each color device produces different shades of the same color.andP;  Thered on one monitor may be different from the red on another monitor, and bothmay be different from the red on a printer.&quot;andM;Kodak is working on a variety of color printer technologies.andP;  One is colorelectrophotography, which is used in the Kodak ColorEdge copier.andP;  Thistechnology has been demonstrated in a non-impact, cut-sheet printer that usesa 300 dot-per-inch LED array to image three colors plus black.andP;  Print speedis 17.5 color pages per minute and offers such features as automaticcollating and stapling.andM;Kodak will soon be incorporating four-color, inkjet printing into a low-costprinter that will be small enough to sit next to a PC and will be designed toprint on plain paper.andM;QMS Inc. has just announced that the OMS ColorScript 100 Model 10 printer hasbeen enhanced to include a number of new value-added features.andM;At a Canadian price of $12,989, the Model 10 is being shipped with 8 MB RAMstandard, &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; legal-size paper support and a larger standardprintable region, increased duty cycle, added HP-GL emulation and spoolingcapabilities.andM;Hewlett-Packard recently introduced its HP PaintWriter XL color-graphicsprinter, its third entry into the color printer market.andM;Costing $4,331, the product is designed to be shared by Macintosh users whosecomputers are on an AppleTalk network.andP;  It prints a page of color graphics in1.5 minutes and has a dual AppleTalk/RS-422A interface.andM;Robert Owens of QMS Inc. says that within the next year color laser will beavailable, but the prices will be $40,000 to $70,000.andP;  Desktop models willalso appear soon, he says.andM;&quot;You will never see the low end of the color market equalling the low end ofthe monochrome market,&quot; says Owens.andP;  &quot;But we'll probably see a reliable, 300DPI, four-color printer under $7,000 within the next 12 months.&quot;andM;Portable printers are another trend, though at a slower rate.andP;  Evans ResearchCorp. states that while many business people benefit from having computingpower at their fingertips while on the road, only a small percentage need togenerate hard copy output on the spot.andM;ERC estimates that less than one-quarter of one per cent of total printerimports in 1989 were of the portable kind, translating to less than 2,000units.andP;  Growth is forecast at 15 to per cent over the next two years.andM;Manufacturers and distributors alike believe that there will be major changesseen in the printer arena in the next few years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
