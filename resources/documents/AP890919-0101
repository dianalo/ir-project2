WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Barney Frank is wrestling with thequestion of whether he can remain an effective liberal in Congressfollowing the disclosure of his relationship with a male prostitute,his friends and allies say.   An aide to Frank said Monday the Massachusetts Democrat will notresign his congressional seat despite calls for his resignation bynewspapers in his district.   Frank declined to be interviewed Monday, but in a weekendinterview with the Boston Globe said he will not seek re-electionnext year if he decides the controversy hurts the liberal causes hehas espoused during 10 years in Congress.   ``The question for him to decide, that will make the difference... is whether he believes he could be an effective member ofCongress, that he would not do this just to go through themotions,'' said Ann Lewis, Frank's sister and a Washington politicalconsultant.   Frank disclosed his homosexuality in 1987 and won re-election thenext year with 70 percent of the vote in a district that has electedhim five times to Congress.   Democratic strategists said they believe Frank's support withinhis own district remains strong, despite the revelations about hisinvolvement with prostitute Stephen L. Gobie. But they said Frankmay feel pressure to resign because of the scandal's effects on hisissues or other Democrats.   The Boston Globe, which enthusiastically endorsed Frankthroughout his political career, said in an editorial Sunday that heshould resign for ``his own good, and for the good of hisconstituents, his causes and Congress.''   The Anchor, a small but influential Roman Catholic newspaper inhis district, called on Frank to resign last week.   Doug Cahn, Frank's administrative assistant, said: ``Barney willnot resign. He wants to see the process with the Ethics Committeemove forward.''   The House ethics committee is investigating Frank's dealings withGobie, at Frank's request.   One group of supporters, the liberal arms-control group Councilfor a Livable World, circulated a letter Monday urging Frank toignore calls for his resignation. It said, ``Even a Barney Frankwhose effectiveness in Congress is somewhat diminished this yearstill ranks among the most effective members in the U.S. Congress.''   Frank has acknowledged that he paid Gobie for sexual relationsafter responding to an ad in a gay newspaper in 1985, and then hiredhim as a personal assistant. Frank said hoped to help Gobie give uphis past, but Gobie said he used Frank's apartment for prostitutionand that Frank was aware of his activities. Frank says he did notknow.   In a taped interview on the ``Geraldo'' talk show telecast today,Gobie elaborated on his claims, saying he ran a female escortservice called ``A Touch of Class,'' from the congressman'sapartment. A friend who ran a male escort service also occasionallycall-forwarded telephone service to Gobie, he said.   ``I more or less served as a reservation clerk for the girls,''he said.   In an interview with Newsweek, Frank said Gobie ``wasn't thefirst prostitute I had used.''   Frank said that because of his difficulties he will lessen hisrole on one issue _ the investigation of alleged influence-peddlingat the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Reaganadministration. He is a member of the House subcommittee leading theHUD investigation.   Frank has been outspoken in a number of liberal causes, butparticularly in areas of ethics legislation, housing, and homosexualrights.   Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Centeron Homelessness and Poverty, described Frank as one of the leadingadvocates for housing programs in Congress and said his problems area concern to other housing advocates.   ``I think there's some concern about the effect that this willhave on his advocacy,'' she said. ``The question is whether theissue will become so consuming that it will obscure his ability totake positions on substantive issues.''   Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund,said other members of Congress have overcome embarrassing personaldisclosures or poor judgment, adding that in the long term ``hiseffectiveness as an important public servant should in no way beharmed by his personal misjudgments.''   Dorothy Reichard, director of Frank's district office in Newton,Mass., said calls and letters have been running 8-to-1 in support.</TEXT></DOC>
