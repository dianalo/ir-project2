The selection and implementation of the mosteffective and practical emergency plan requires a realistic projectionof the quantities of the different radionuclides liable to be released,the time available before the release commences, and the expected durationof the release. The time-dependent and realistic accident consequenceevaluation (TRACE) is a software package capable of rapidly evaluatingthe range of releases associated with potential plant accidents, in apredictive way, and on a realistic and time-dependent basis. It providesthe plant staff adequate and necessary information for considerationof emergency response plan activation.</TEXT></DOC>
