Meanwhile, Frankfurt and Tokyo stock prices rose after their recent declines.    The Bank of England said bank lending climbed a seasonally adjusted #4.9 billion ($7.95 billion) in July, a record increase far above market forecasts of #3.5 billion. The jump follows a #3.9 billion increase in June, and strengthened fears that Britain's credit boom eventually will lead to sharply higher interest rates and inflation.    London investors, jittery after a onepoint rise in interest rates earlier this month, reacted swiftly. The figures' announcement late yesterday morning reversed a rally, sending the 100-share index down as much as 74 points from the morning high.    The 100-share index later recovered, closing at 2185.3, down 12.3 points for the day. The Financial Times 30-share index ended down 12.2 points at 1700.2. Bond prices also tumbled.    Dealers said trading was chaotic as prices fluctuated throughout the day.    Stock prices started off firm on the back of rises in Tokyo yesterday and New York Wednesday. At one point in the morning the 100-share index was up 33.8 points.    But then the market collapsed after the lending news, and the 100-share index quickly dropped to the day's low of 2157.2, down 40.4 points.    A strong opening yesterday on Wall Street and lack of heavy selling lifted prices from their lows.    Volume wasn't excessively heavy, as 633.4 million shares changed hands, up from 529.1 million Wednesday.    &quot;The bank lending figures seem too bad to be true,&quot; said Robin Marshall, an economist at Chase Manhattan Securities here.    A Bank of England official noted that the annual rate of increase of about 22% was comparable to levels recorded at the beginning of this year, but above the annual rate of recent months. Figures released by major banks suggested that consumer borrowing, a possible signal of an overheating economy, didn't increase sharply.    Analysts speculated that the surge in borrowing could stem partly from delays in settling share transactions in the recently burgeoning stock market. But even allowing for such possible one-time factors, the level of lending &quot;isn't healthy,&quot; said Chris Tinker, an economist at London stockbrokers Phillips andamp; Drew.    Market participants had been bracing for a jolt since the government raised interest rates earlier this month. Analysts said the lending figure, coupled with the latest money supply statistics, showed the government was right to be worried then. But they disagreed whether the rise in banks' base lending rates to 10% from 9% would be sufficient to tame the credit expansion.    &quot;Essentially, the government is in a terrible mess,&quot; said Tim Congdon, an economist at Shearson Lehman Securities, a stockbrokerage here that has long warned of the inflationary consequences of expanding credit.    &quot;The credit boom isn't going to go away,&quot; Mr. Congdon said. Higher corporate borrowing is reinforcing consumer credit and mortgage demand, and the monthly borrowing increase could top #3 billion for months to come, he added. &quot;It's absolutely clear there has to be a further substantial rise in interest rates.&quot;    But Mr. Congdon said he doubts the government would raise rates soon, particularly because of the ambitious calendar of share offerings for the rest of this year. Other economists predicted the government will wait to see the effects of this month's increase, and added that pressure on interest rates has been eased by the pound's strength.    The borrowing surge was reflected in the higher-than-expected increase in M3, Britain's most-watched, broad monetary measure. Provisional figures showed M3 rose a seasonally adjusted 2.3% in July from June and by an unadjusted 20.9% in the 12 months ended July 31. M3 represents cash, notes and short-term private sector bank deposits.    The government's preferred indicator, the narrow measure called M0, was closer to expectations, rising a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in July from June and an unadjusted 5.3% for the 12 months. The annual rate is near the top of the government's target range of growth between 2% and 6% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1988. But the Bank of England official said the figure was partly an aberration because of a sharp rise in bankers' deposits at the central bank.    Meanwhile, British Petroleum and the British government began the promotional campaign for October's #7.5 billion sale of the government's remaining stake in the company. An unusually large portion will be earmarked for foreign investors. BP rose 5 1/2 pence to 352 1/2 pence ($5.72), and other oil shares were higher.    In Frankfurt, share prices posted a modest recovery in lively trading after two consecutive days of declines. The FAZ index edged up 3.22 points to 660.19.    Investors generally ignored the weakness of the dollar and declines in domestic bonds, brokers said.    Demand from domestic institutional investors, who perceived the market as oversold, pushed prices higher around midday and later lured foreign buyers into the market, brokers said.    BASF rose 4.4 marks to 337 marks ($183.95). The chemical group reported pretax earnings for the first half rose 3.7%. Other chemical shares were also higher, including Bayer, up 3.6 to 356, and Hoechst, up 3 to 331.5.    In Tokyo, share prices also rebounded, on bargain-hunting and the dollar's slight recovery from morning levels.    The Nikkei stock average rose 164.98 points to 25396.57. It was the first increase in five sessions.    Turnover expanded to 1.1 billion shares from 900 million shares Wednesday. Gainers outnumbered losers, 523 to 371.    Traders said a modest upturn in financial stocks, which account for more than 35% of the value of shares listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's First Section Index, as well as buying in certain construction, drug and food stocks, helped boost the Nikkei average.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                                 Aug 19   Aug 18     Year U.S. ........................... 307.4    307.2    + 34.8 Britain ........................ 658.1    666.6    + 32.2 Canada ......................... 448.7    450.5    + 34.7 Japan ......................... 1241.8   1246.1    + 31.4 France ......................... 417.9    419.6    +  2.4 Germany ........................ 249.7    254.6    -  3.9 Hong Kong ..................... 2461.5   2503.7    + 38.4 Switzerland .................... 206.3    208.8    +  2.7 Australia ...................... 393.5    393.7    + 49.1 World index .................... 481.9    481.3    + 35.1</TEXT></DOC>
