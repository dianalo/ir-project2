An irate customer had been fumingover a proposal to raise water rates, after consumers have endured months ofhumiliation as they tell out-of-town guests not to flush.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DROP IN WATER USE DRIVES PRICES UP  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Like water agencies throughout the state, the DWP is losing money: It isselling less water to water-saving customers, causing a drop in revenues,while the cost of providing that water is growing.;   Santa Barbara, whichlast year regaled the world with images of residents painting their lawnsgreen after watering was prohibited, now is dropping most of its conservationrestrictions. The new rules will allow people to buy more water and enable thecity to cover the costs of providing the new water residents have demanded.;  Projected revenue loss; In Los Angeles, Department of Water and Powerofficials say the problem is dire because a mandatory rationing plan calledfor 15 percent cuts, but customers instead saved 30 percent. The departmentnow faces a projected revenue loss of at least $70 million in its $300 millionbudget. Meanwhile, the costs of maintaining DWP's system remain the same, andsome costs have increased.;   A toilet retrofit program has been so successful-- there have been 115,000 orders for the $100-per-water-wasting-toilet rebatesince spring 1990 -- that the program is $8.5 million over its original $2million budget and probably will end in October.;   The cost of meeting newwater quality standards also has risen.;   If rates don't rise considerably,water department officials say, projects to expand reclamation and recyclingwill be delayed. The agency also would lose its AA bond rating, they say.;  &quot;If we can't issue debt, we literally shut down,&quot; said Mike Gage, DWPcommission president. The agency still would have water, he said, but it wouldhave to pay tens of millions of dollars in higher interest and it would losethe water-saving benefits of projects put on hold.;   'Everyone screamed';  The Santa Clara Valley Water District has faced similar problems. Earlier thisyear, the district was in danger of losing its AA bond rating and raised itswater prices by about 50 percent. &quot;When that hit, everyone screamed,&quot; saidboard member Pat Ferraro.;   Although the financial outlook has improved,Ferraro said he still worries about the district's ability to finance anextensive water reuse project he'd like to see.;   And the increase hasn'tbeen enough to cover some water-saving programs the board wants to start,Ferraro said. For instance, although the district hired a conservationmanager, it has postponed a toilet rebate program.;   And then there's SantaBarbara, which at one point imposed 45 percent rationing while officialsscrambled to find more water. That scramble yielded emergency water from thestate and a desalination plant. Along with &quot;March miracle&quot; rains, the newwater sources have convinced city officials they can meet 80 percent of normaldemand for three years even if the drought continues.;   But the new watersources cost a lot of money, leaving a potential deficit of at least $1million in the city's water budget.;   People can 'start landscaping';  Deputy City Administrator Sandra Lizarraga is diplomatic in describing themotivation for a proposal to roll back rationing: &quot;We're letting people knowthey can abandon their hardship practices, and they can start landscaping, butwe're also promoting wise use of water.&quot;;   Bob Bronfen, vice chairman of thecity's water commission, is blunt: &quot;Hopefully, people will use more water.&quot;;  Bronfen, who paid $500 for water one month last year, said he approved the newrules reluctantly, &quot;because I think what we really want in the long run is forpeople to use less water. . . . But right now, we have to balance thebudget.&quot;;   Los Angeles never faced the kind of Draconian rationing imposed inSanta Barbara. But with the unexpected 30 percent conservation, the Departmentof Water and Power now is seeking an 11 percent rate increase and a hike in atemporary drought surcharge, from about a penny per 83 gallons to as much as apenny per 37 gallons.;   'The state's broke too';   &quot;It's inevitable that whenyou get substantial conservation savings you lose revenue, and you have tomake it up somehow,&quot; said Marc Reisner, author of &quot;Cadillac Desert,&quot; a highlyacclaimed book about Western water policy.;   &quot;I don't have an answer. Youcan't look to the state. The state's broke too.&quot;;   But raising rates afterpeople conserve twice as much as they are asked to &quot;makes people verycynical,&quot; Reisner said.;   Some city council members here say the DWP shouldlook to its own budget for cuts to make up the loss, but Commissioner Greensays the department has cut what it can.;   &quot;It's really the horns of adilemma,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't want to cut that toilet program. But it's chewingup our budget.&quot;;   Said Mary Nichols, the third environmentalist on thefive-member DWP board: &quot;We're not saying, 'Use more water.' We're saying youdon't have to suffer. . . . If people are so afraid of paying a penalty thatthey're not flushing toilets when they should, and not washing their handswhen they should, and spreading diseases, that's their problem -- it's notsomething we're telling them to do.&quot;;   New revenue plan considered; Theproblem of plummeting revenues is widespread enough that the state PublicUtilities Commission, which regulates private companies such as the San JoseWater Co., is studying whether to develop a new revenue plan for companieshowling over their losses.;   The San Jose Water Co. has gotten approvalseveral times in recent years to raise its rates, according to Sharon Whaley,a spokeswoman for the company. But the increases covered only increased costsof buying water, she said. The company was compensated for lost revenue fromdecreased sales only once, when the PUC decided last year that the companycould keep conservation penalty money it had collected.;   Even if the droughtends, water officials say, the state is facing more rate increases to coverthe growing costs of developing new water sources and of meeting tougherquality standards. In Southern California, the Metropolitan Water Districtexpects to nearly triple its water prices over the next decade to help cover aplanned $6 billion expansion.;   Excess capacity; &quot;You can see a continuedincrease in costs,&quot; said MWD general manager Carl Boronkay. &quot;Water was cheap,still is cheap.&quot; Because the Metropolitan Water District's system was builtbig to meet needs for several decades, he said, the excess capacity of theearly years fed bad water-use habits. Eventually, conservation was inevitable,he said, &quot;and the time is here.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAMELA KRAMER, Mercury News Los Angeles Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910915  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,156  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 15, 199100259179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
