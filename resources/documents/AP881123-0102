Bush called Scowcroft, a 63-year-old retired Air Force lieutenantgeneral, ``a trusted friend'' who ``understands the White House, theway (Capitol) Hill works and the intelligence community as well.''   The vice president made the announcement before heading for hisoceanside family retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, for a five-dayThanksgiving vacation. Bush has suggested he will complete thenaming of his Cabinet within a month.   Bush called Scowcroft ``an honest broker'' and said, ``Because ofhis tremendous experience, obviously he will convey to me,unvarnished, his own view on policy matters of tremendousimportance.''   Bush said the ``national security adviser has to have directaccess, day and night. I will be one who takes a keen interest inthese matters. I have a lot of ideas. They need to be tempered byhis experience and judgment.''   Scowcroft said he agrees with Bush that ``the future holds forthe United States tremendous challenges and also opportunities. I'mlooking forward to helping him cope successfully with the challengesand to take full advantage of the opportunities.''   Asked about changes instituted at the National Security Counselafter the Iran-Contra affair, Scowcroft said, ``I am very pleased. Ithink that Gen. (Colin) Powell and Secretary (Frank) Carlucci beforehim have left the NSC staff in really excellent condition, and itwill be a joy to assume responsibility for the system the way it isoperating now.''   As he had Tuesday, Bush deflected questions concerning reportsthat he was planning to name former Sen. John Tower as his defensesecretary. He complained that speculation on various appointmentsmerely raises potential appointees' hopes, which then can be dashedif ``it doesn't work out.''   Asked if he would soon put Tower ``out of his misery, one way orthe other,'' he replied, ``I'm asking you to do that.''   Tower, the former chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, was most recently in the public eye as chairman ofPresident Reagan's commission to look into the Iran-Contra affair.Scowcroft was one of the two other members, along with formerSecretary of State Edmund Muskie.   Bush was asked about Scowcroft's reputation for caution indealing with the Soviets.   ``Do I share the caution he has sometimes signaled? The answer isyes,'' Bush said. ``That doesn't mean there won't be forwardprogress.''   Bush noted his Dec. 7 meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev and said, ``I will have an opportunity to make that veryclear to Mr. Gorbachev. What I won't be able to make clear to himis, here's our detailed arms control formulation.''   The president-elect praised Powell, the outgoing nationalsecurity adviser, as ``an outstanding adviser to the president ofthe United States. He's won the confidence of the president, of theCapitol, and of all of us for whom he's worked.''   The vice president said he did not now what Powell's future wouldhold.   In answer to reporters' questions, Scowcroft said:   _ ``There's no question'' that there are serious problems in thedefense budget. ``It is substantially underfunded and SecretaryCarlucci has already taken some very courageous steps in thedirection of readjusting the defense program. More has to be done.''   _ On asking U.S. allies to bear more of the defense load, ``It'sof course especially important for the United States at thisparticular time. But I think it's also important to approach thisgeneral issue cooperatively with our allies, not combatively.''   _ It was too soon to say whether the START talks with the Sovietswould resume on schedule in the new year.   _ It would be ``very premature'' to say whether he would retainBush's national security aide, Donald Gregg, or whom he might nameto the national security staff.   Scowcroft also served as an arms control adviser to PresidentJimmy Carter and who headed a special commission in 1983 thatstudied basing of the MX missile.   Scowcroft served as a deputy to Henry Kissinger when Kissingerserved both as secretary of state and national security adviserduring the Nixon and Ford administrations.   When Kissinger surrendered the national security post in 1975,Scowcroft was named to fill the job.   A 1947 graduate of West Point, he became an officer in the AirForce. He served as a professor of Russian history and politicalscience at both West Point and the Air Force Academy. In the early1970s, he served as President Nixon's military assistant.   On Tuesday, Bush met in Houston with incoming Mexican PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari for a get-acquainted session. Both he andSalinas, who takes office Dec. 1, called the meeting a first steptoward improved U.S.-Mexican relations.   Over a six-course lunch that included roasted pheasant and gildedchocolate truffles, Bush and Salinas discussed drugs, immigration,trade and Mexico's staggering $102 billion international debt, aidessaid.   ``I am absolutely confident after this initial visit that we'reboth committed to improving a bilateral relationship that isessential, in my view, as far as the United States of America isconcerned,'' Bush said in brief remarks after talks that lasted twohours.   Salinas, using similarly upbeat diplomatic language thatdisclosed few specifics, called the session ``a positive,respectful, cordial dialogue which I am certain will do a great dealto improve the relations between Mexico and the United States.''   Bush thanked Salinas for greeting him in his adopted hometown.Salinas, speaking through a translator, invited Bush to visit himnext time in Mexico City.   The vice president, in remarks applied to both Mexico and Canada,pledged to ``never neglect our own friends in this hemisphere.''   In an address earlier Tuesday to a meeting of Republicangovernors in Point Clear, Ala., Bush congratulated Canadian PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney for a ``spectacular win'' in Monday'snational elections that retained a House of Commons majority forMulroney's Conservative party.   Bush called the election a ringing endorsement not only for theprime minister, but for the recently negotiated U.S.-Canadianfree-trade pact whose fate had become a campaign issue.   Bush also told the Republican Governors Association he would namenegotiators for budget talks with Congress ``on the first day of mypresidency,'' suggesting a possible intention to sidestep the usualpractice in which a new president first submits his own budgetproposals.   He said he viewed his election as a mandate against new taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
