One cohort (N = 1099) lived in a communitywith moderate levels of photochemical pollution and low levels of otherpollutants, and the second (N = 1117) lived in a community with veryhigh levels of photochemical oxidant and relatively high levels of sulfatesand particulates. Studies included measurement of forced expiratory volumesand flow rates and single-breath nitrogen washout, as well as use ofa standardized questionnaire. The data represent 47 percent of 2340 and58 percent of 1935 residents, respectively, of the original communitysamples. Mean baseline spirometry and nitrogen washout for those whowere and those who were not retested were similar, reflecting the factthat loss to follow-up was primarily due to changes of residence. Inthe more polluted area there were significantly worse lung function testresults for both men and women at baseline and significantly more rapiddeterioration at follow-up. Mean changes in nitrogen washout were significantlygreater in the more polluted community for both sexes and for all agegroups including children. Most of the spirometric test results showedsignificantly more rapid decline among adults in the more polluted community.These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic exposuresto a mix of photochemical oxidants, sulfates and particulates are associatedwith increased loss of lung function, which is especially marked amongtests that reflect function of the small airways.</TEXT></DOC>
