Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   Everyone in Washington has a Bob Dole story, but my personal favorite is told by an aide to former Iowa Sen. Roger Jepsen. The two were talking on the Senate floor about how Mr. Jepsen should vote on a particular bill, when Mr. Dole wandered over. After listening for a few minutes, Mr. Dole grew impatient and offered the pair some Capitol Hill wisdom.    &quot;All you need to know is this,&quot; he said. &quot;You can never go wrong voting for a bill that fails, or against a bill that passes.&quot;    The remark more or less sums up congressional evasion and posturing, but more important is what it says about Bob Dole as a creature of the Congress. For at least the past decade Republicans have campaigned profitably against the Washington establishment, the Democratic-led Congress in particular. Mr. Dole may be the first GOP presidential candidate in recent memory to run as an integral part of Congress. Jack Kemp, Pete Du Pont and Pat Robertson attack Congress from the right. Even George Bush has begun to run against a Congress that obstructs the Reagan agenda (though admittedly it's hard to imagine him as &quot;give 'em hell, Harry&quot;).    But Mr. Dole has so far spent much of his campaign attacking Vice President Bush for, among other things, having the effrontery to attack Congress. &quot;It's too bad he's knocking Congress and the Republican leaders on Capitol Hill,&quot; says one Dole press release, though of course Mr. Bush was really knocking the Democrats. &quot;I don't want confrontations with Congress. I want to work with Congress,&quot; Mr. Dole said in New Hampshire two weeks ago.    To do what? The answer matters, because if the president in 1989 is a Republican he's almost certain to face a Congress dominated by the same Democratic leaders and agenda as today's. Does &quot;working with the Congress&quot; mean settling for half of Jim Wright's agenda, as it has for much of the past year? Or does it mean leading the country in his own direction, as Mr. Reagan did for most of his first six years? A Republican president who hasn't campaigned on anything in particular will find himself buffeted by events and compromising to accept a Democratic agenda.    The questions are especially relevant for Mr. Dole, because of his legendary lack of &quot;vision.&quot; In the Senate, Mr. Dole has earned a reputation as a brilliant strategist in implementing other people's ideas, bending whichever way the strongest political wind blows. He helped enact President Reagan's tax cuts and tax indexing in 1981, but a years later he was working to raise taxes to reduce his major preoccupation, the federal budget deficit.    Mr. Dole's campaign themes haven't helped change that image much either. His theme of &quot;shared values&quot; -- the &quot;one of us&quot; ads -- may attract votes in Iowa, but they won't give him a mandate in Washington. In at least a signal of hope, he has begun to hit harder on issues of a federal spending freeze and the line-item veto, and earlier this week he even took after the &quot;House liberal Democrats&quot; for turning down aid to the Contras.    A good example of why many in Washington remain skeptical, however, is Mr. Dole's support for creation of the National Economic Commission. Born in obscurity last year, the bipartisan commission is supposed to report by March 1989 on ways to reduce the deficit, which Mr. Dole calls &quot;public enemy number one.&quot; It could yet become a stalking horse for a major tax rise in 1989, however, and many Republicans in Congress and the White House fear Mr. Dole may have planned it that way.    The commission idea had bounced around in Democratic circles for years, touted by such as Mario Cuomo and Robert Strauss. It didn't get anywhere in Congress, however, until Bob Dole became its champion. Sen. Dole made sure it survived last December's budget conference, and he has praised it on the stump before and since. He likes to compare it to the bipartisan 1983 Social Security Commission, which provided political cover for the compromise that he claims &quot;saved&quot; Social Security. In fact, that commission mostly &quot;saved&quot; its members from any political responsibility for raising taxes three times in six years, including payroll taxes on the self-employed by 33%.    As for the new commission, the Democrats have already appointed members who want to raise taxes so badly they can hardly contain themselves. Mr. Dole has pledged he won't raise &quot;tax rates,&quot; but he hasn't said anything about other kinds of taxes. One of Mr. Dole's two appointments to the commission is almost certain to be New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, who also isn't opposed to higher taxes. If Mr. Dole really wanted to counter the Democrats, he'd name someone like Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who wants to be on the commission and who understands the arguments for spending restraint and budget reform.    If Republicans need any other reason to pin Mr. Dole down now, they might consider the way he handled the recent Senate attempt to overturn the Supreme Court's Grove City civil rights decision. In the last Congress, Mr. Dole sponsored the administration's moderate bill, which didn't go very far. But when Sen. Orrin Hatch offered a similar idea last month, as an amendment to Sen. Ted Kennedy's Democratic bill, Mr. Dole voted against it. And when the Kennedy bill later came up for a final vote, Mr. Dole was out of town. </TEXT></DOC>
