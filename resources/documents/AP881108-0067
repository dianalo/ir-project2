In the latest anti-Chun protest, eight students armed withhomemade firebombs occupied a prosecutor's office in central Taejoncity today to highlight calls for Chun's arrest. Police arrested allthe students within 30 minutes.   ``Mr. Chun still thinks he has no ill-gotten wealth, but he iswilling to donate most of his assets if he is assured that it wouldquiet down the raging public protests,'' said one of two partysources who spoke on condition of anonymity.   In return, the Democratic Justice Party source said, Chun wantsassurances he will be left alone by investigators from oppositionparties and those representing his friend and successor, Roh Tae-woo.   The second party source said that by giving up most of hiswealth, Chun hopes to atone for major financial scandals in whichsome of his relatives have been implicated.   Chun is accused of corruption and human rights abuses during hisseven years of authoritarian rule which ended in February. TheNational Assembly is conducting an unprecedented probe into thecorruption allegations.   The former president, his associates and relatives are accused ofdiverting huge sums in stocks and land and sending much of itoverseas to the United States and Australia.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in1980, has denied involvement in any corruption.   The two party sources said Chun has personal assets of $5.7million, including a $1.4 million residence _ about twice as much asthe amount he officially registered with authorities in 1983.   They attributed Chun's greater wealth to increases in land pricesduring the past five years.   President Roh, in Australia on an official visit, reportedlyasked the Australian government to check if Chun has any personalassets there.   Last week, thousands of people tried to march on Chun's house topress for his arrest. Opponents are planning another march on Chun'shouse Thursday after a major rally in central Seoul.   On Monday, another member of the ex-president's family wasarrested on corruption charges. Chun Soon-hwan, 67, a cousin, wascharged with taking $52,000 in bribes from a businessman.   The former president's younger brother, Chun Kyong-hwan, 46, wassentenced in August to seven years' imprisonment for taking bribesand embezzling millions of dollars in official funds.   Government sources said two other family members may be arrestedsoon on corruption charges.</TEXT></DOC>
