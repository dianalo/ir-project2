BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Airlines' ground workers overwhelminglyaccepted a four-year contract that makes its mechanics the highestpaid in the industry and includes an unusual flexible benefitpackage, their union said Friday.   The pact, which also accelerates some new workers more quicklyalong the airline's wage scale, was approved by a vote of 13,103 to4,157, or 76 percent in favor, said Transport Workers Unionspokesman Jim Gannon in Washington.   Gannon said all locals approved the contract, ranging from ahigh of 91 percent at American's home base of Dallas-Fort WorthInternational Airport to a low of 66 percent.   ``This contract includes many innovative provisions that willbenefit both the company and its employees,'' American vicepresident Charles Pasciuto said. ``It is a real win-win deal.''   American's first proposal included provisions where employeeswould begin contributing toward their own health insurance, a keysticking point in earlier negotiations.   The new contract solves that conflict with ``flex benefits,''under which the company will allocate to each employee a certainamount of money to be used toward benefits and the worker will beable to select the desired coverage.   All workers were moved up on American's 14-step pay scale. Thescale, under which it takes 12 years to reach top pay, has longbeen a sore point with workers and the union had sought to reducethe time to five years.   Gannon said the contract also makes top-scale mechanics thehighest paid in the industry.   During the life of the contract, a line mechanic's top salarywill rise from $18.75 per hour to $20.58 an hour, plus a $2 perhour license premium for mechanics with two licenses.   The agreement covers 22,000 American workers, includingmechanics, bag handlers, ground crews, stock clerks, guards,meteorologists and aircraft cleaners.   The contract was devised a month ago during a marathonnegotiating session between the union, the airline and a federalmediator who had been called in after workers rejected an earlieroffer.</TEXT></DOC>
