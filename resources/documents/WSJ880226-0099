Rose (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><TEXT>   Viewers of the Olympics this weekend are likely to get a glimpse of what could be the next foreign import: Soviet hockey players.    After years of negotiations, American and Canadian hockey officials expect their Soviet counterparts finally to allow a few of their athletes to play in the National Hockey League next season. If that happens -- and if the guests don't fall on their faces -- it could open the door to more Soviets in hockey and other sports. Already, progress on the hockey front has raised hopes among the handful of U.S. basketball teams with Soviet draft picks that they will get their men after the summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.    The Soviet policy of glasnost, or openness, no doubt will get much of the credit. But for those involved, the deals are business transactions more than anything else.    For the teams in the NHL, the goal is to win more games and lure more fans. If two Soviets don the red and green uniforms of the New Jersey Devils as the team hopes, for example, they could help to catapult the long-suffering franchise past close competitors in its division.    For the Soviets, money is a prime factor. The Soviet hockey federation is expected to claim a healthy chunk of players' compensation -- just as the Soviet tennis federation has since Soviet tennis players hit the U.S. circuit in 1986. &quot;The hockey federation, along with the other sports federations, has been told to be self-supporting,&quot; says R. Alan Eagleson, who is participating in the Calgary, Alberta, talks as executive director of the National Hockey League Players Association. &quot;This gives them an opportunity to create more revenue from an untapped source.&quot;    A hockey pact would mark a further thawing of the icy resistance Communist countries once showed on the issue of supplying North American teams. Petr Klima of the Detroit Red Wings wears the number 85 on his uniform because that's the year the club helped sneak him out of Czechoslovakia. Today, by contrast, Mr. Eagleson says, about half of the dozen or so Czechs in the NHL are here with the permission of their home country -- though most are older players.    Although a deal in hockey is closer than ever, officials in that and other sports say patience is the biggest asset in dealing with the Soviets. Mr. Eagleson notes that, in talks for games between Soviet and North American hockey teams, his Soviet counterparts have been known to come up with what he generously describes as last-minute wrinkles: requests for free hockey tickets or for airplane tickets in case of injury to a Soviet player. &quot;Then they don't get injured, and you never get the tickets back,&quot; he says, adding that he speculates the tactics are revenue-raising efforts.    In basketball, the Atlanta Hawks, among other teams, have drafted Soviet stars in the hope that they, too, will someday be allowed to play in the U.S. In the meantime, the franchise keeps in touch with the two players and on good terms with their country. Last year, six Soviet players teamed with Hawk players for scrimmages in three U.S. cities.    Of course, it's still possible the draftees won't be allowed to play in North America. Last year, the Vancouver Canucks drafted a Soviet player after Soviet hockey officials led them to believe he'd be available in the fall. He wasn't. (The team now hopes to get him after the Olympics.)    One problem for the Soviets is that they don't want to part with their best young talent. At the same time, they want players offered to the NHL to do well. Also, in addition to facing cultural and political barriers, the Soviets would have to adjust to the rougher -- and sometimes dirtier -- play of North American teams.    The Devils have perhaps the best shot at landing quality players -- the Olympians Viacheslav Fetisov and Alexei Kasatonov. Some hockey officials think a Soviet gold medal in hockey would boost the chances those two would be included among the players the Soviets are expected to offer after the games. An arrangement on such terms would both reward players who have devoted years to Soviet hockey and offer incentive to others.    Even if an agreement is reached, hockey officials don't expect the Soviets to flood the market. Mr. Eagleson figures two or three could enter the league next year and &quot;a couple a year after that.&quot;    For some, however, even one Soviet in the NHL is too many. &quot;I'd bar them,&quot; says Jimmy Devellano, general manager of the Red Wings. &quot;All they want to do is come over here and take our money. The poor Soviet players probably wouldn't wind up with the money anyway.&quot;    Mr. Devellano allows an exception to his anti-Soviet policy: &quot;If one were to defect and want to play, that's different.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
