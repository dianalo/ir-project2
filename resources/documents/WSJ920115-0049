But analysts said the mainimpetus continued to come from individual investorsabandoning safe but low-yielding bank certificates of depositand money market funds for the riskier -- and so far morerewarding -- returns of stocks. The analysts said much of thenew money is flowing into the stock market via big mutualfunds.   Investors seem unconcerned about a deluge of bad economicnews yesterday. The government reported that December retailsales were down 0.4% and overall retail sales in 1991 werethe worst in years. What's more, auto makers reported dismalsales for the first 10 days of January, indicating thatconsumers aren't being persuaded to take advantage of lowinterest rates that are supposed to stimulate the economy.   &quot;If there was ever a question about whether the marketlooks at current events or looks far ahead, this day shouldanswer it for all time,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investmentofficer at First Albany Corp. &quot;You don't drive the market bylooking in the rear-view mirror.&quot;   Mr. Johnson said the stock market is sending a powerfulsignal that the economy will recover later this year. Andwhile that same signal a year ago turned out to be wrong, Mr.Johnson said there are good reasons to believe it's correctthis time. For instance, short-term interest rates are lowerthis year than they were last year and an increasing numberof homeowners and corporations are taking advantage of thoserates to refinance debt, improving their own cash flows.   What's more, consumer demand has been squelched for morethan a year, creating pent-up demand, and consumer confidenceappears to be stabilizing. And finally, it's likely thatWashington will produce some sort of economic-stimulationpackage.   &quot;When I see all that, I walk away with one simple thought:Something good has to come from it,&quot; said Mr. Johnson.   But he warned that while the stock market was able toweather the disappointment of no economic recovery in 1991,this time it has risen so far so fast that investor-punishingsetbacks are likely if any hitches develop.   &quot;We're verging on the edge of euphoria,&quot; he said. &quot;Thiscan't be a false start or the market will have a sharpcorrection.&quot;   Other analysts noted that the bond market, which has beenfalling for the past week and pushing interest rates up,apparently is forecasting an economic recovery, too. Bondprices tend to fall as the economy recovers because bondinvestors worry about resurging inflation.   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp., said hefears that any action by Washington to further stimulate theeconomy will spook the bond market even more. &quot;I think theeconomy will recover without any fiscal stimulus, given timeand low interest rates,&quot; he said. &quot;But Congress isn'tresponding to economics, it's responding to politics, sowe're going to get some kind of fiscal stimulus. The questionis what will do the least harm?&quot;   Mr. Sohn said he expects Democrats to demand some kind ofmiddle-class tax cut to spur consumer spending while the Bushadministration presses for a capital-gains tax cut. &quot;It'sgoing to be a sausage-making process,&quot; he said. &quot;Whatever wedo to stimulate now will create the conditions for inflation18 months to two years from now.&quot;   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices soared in heavy trading. Volume on the NewYork Stock Exchange totaled 264.6 million shares. Advancingissues on the Big Board easily outpaced decliners 1,250 to525.                                                                                                          Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bondlost about 1/2 point, or approximately $5 for each $1,000face amount. The issue's yield rose to 7.54%.                                                                                                          The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, thecurrency was quoted at 1.5920 marks and 126.84 yen, comparedwith 1.5775 marks and 127.05 yen Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
