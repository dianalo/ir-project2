The baby-food maker previously had said that its CWT Inc. trucking unit didn't fit its long-term growth plan and that, as a result, management of the unit requested a chance to purchase it.    A Gerber spokesman said the unit, which has about $135 million in annual revenue, will be sold in pieces.    The company said it didn't expect to take any additional charges for closing the operation. In its second quarter ended Sept. 30, Gerber took a $13.6 million charge associated with the unit and accounted for the unit as a discontinued operation.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Gerber shares closed up 25 cents, at $39.75.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
