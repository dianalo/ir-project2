(``NASD'') submittedon August 5, 1986, copies of a proposed rule change (``proposed rule change''or ``proposal'') pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, to amend sections 5(e) and5(f) of Appendix F to Article III, section 34 of the NASD's Rules of FairPractice. Section 34(b) of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice requires thatcompensation paid to members and associated persons in connection withtheir participation in the public offering of a direct participation program(``DPP'') \1\<NOTE/> be ``fair and reasonable.'' Section 5 of Appendix F setsforth the types of compensation which will be deemed fair and reasonablepursuant to section 34(b). The amendment to section 5(e) generally prohibitsmembers and associated persons from directly or indirectly accepting non-cashsales incentive items offered as an inducement to sell interests in DPPs,from DPPs, sponsors of DPPs, or affiliates of those sponsors (collectively,``sponsors'').\2\<NOTE/> The amendment, however, permits the member, itself, to providenon-cash sales incentive items to its associated persons in connectionwith an in-house sales incentive program, provided that no sponsor ``directlyor indirectly participates in or contributes to providing such non-cashsales incentive item.'' In this connection, the NASD interprets the word``sponsor'' to apply both to sponsors who are affiliated with members andto those who are not affiliated with members.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Article III, section 34(d)(2) of the NASD's Rules of FairPractice defines ``direct participation program'' as a program which providesfor flow-through tax consequences regardless of the structure of the legalentity or vehicle for distribution including, but not limited to, oil andgas programs, real estate programs, agricultural programs, cattle programs,condonimium securities, Subchapter S corporate offerings and all otherprograms of a similar nature, regardless of the industry represented bythe program, or any combination thereof. Excluded from this definitionare, <T3>inter alia,</T3> real estate investment trusts and investment companiesregistered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. <T3>NASD Manual</T3> andpara; 2192, at 2160.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The one exception to this general prohibition permitsan associated person to accept, from each sponsor, non-cash sales incentiveswith an aggregate value of $50.00 or less per year (section 5(e)(1-3)).The amendment to section 5(f) clarifies that subpart (f) applies to <T3>cash</T3> compensation of any kind (whereas subpart (e) applies to<T3>non-cash</T3> sales incentive items). It specifies that a member mayreceive cash compensation from sponsors under certain conditions, ``subjectto the limitations on direct and indirect non-cash sales incentives'' setforth in amended section 5(e). The amendment adds, as a condition to themember's acceptance of cash compensation, that the compensation must notbe ``directly or indirectly related to any non-cash sales incentive itemprovided by the member to its associated persons'' (section 5(f)(5)).\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Commission also is approving at this time proposedrule change SR-NASD-88-13, which prohibits members and associated personsfrom accepting non-cash sales incentives in excess of $50 per person perissuer annually, in connection with distributions of public offerings ofsecurities. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. <T2>XXX</T2> (September <T2>XXX</T2>, 1988).Sponsors of DPPs are of two general types: Those who are affiliated witha broker-dealer and those who are not. Both categories of sponsors typicallyoffer their DPPs through a network of broker-dealers; in the case of anaffiliated sponsor, that network includes the broker-dealer with whichthe sponsor is affiliated. The NASD asserts that both categories of sponsorsoffer non-cash sales incentives to NASD member broker-dealers, to be distributedto the members' associated persons as bonuses for the sale of particularDPP products. These non-cash sales incentive programs may be particularlyimportant for non-affiliated sponsors because these sponsors often lackany formal relationship with a particular member. Instead, they rely onsales incentive programs to encourage associated persons of broker-dealersto sell their products. In this manner, the unaffiliated sponsors can avoidthe costs connected with employment of a sales force.Non-cash sales incentives offered by DPP sponsors (both affiliated andnon-affiliated) customarily take the form of luxury merchandise or exotictrips. An associated person becomes eligible to receive the sales incentiveitem by exceeding designated dollar amounts of sales for the product offeredby the sponsor. The dollar amount of sales required to trigger eligibilityfor a particular sales incentive item increases proportionately with theperceived value of that item.The proposed rule change would prohibit a practice in which sponsors providesales incentives and bonsues indirectly to associated persons. Currentsections 5 (e) and (f) prohibit the offering of non-cash sales incentiveitems <T3>directly </T3>to associated persons of members, but permit non-cashsales incentives and bonsues to be offered indirectly to those associates,through cash payments made by the sponsor of the DPP to the member, whichthe member then applies to satisfy the requirements for the non-cash awardoffered by the sponsor. When an associated person meets the requirementfor a particular award, the award is provided by the sponsor to the qualifiedassociated person. The proposal would eliminate this indirect form of providingnon-cash sales incentives to associated persons, on the ground that suchnon-cash sales incentive programs offered by sponsors undermine the members'ability to supervise and control their sales forces.As noted above, the proposal permits members to continue offering in-house,non-cash sales incentive programs to their associated persons, providedthat sponsors are prohibited from participating in or contributing to,those programs. Thus, under amended section 5(e), sponsors may not dictatethe products the associated person must sell to qualify for the member-sponsoredsales incentive, nor may sponsors participate in the selection of and arrangementsfor, any sales incentive provided by members to their associated persons.Further, sponsors may not contribute monetarily to any sales incentivesoffered by members to their associates. These prohibitions against theparticipation of sponsors in members' in-house sales incentive programsapply both to sponsors who are affiliated with members and to sponsorswho are not affiliated with members.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The proposal, however, does permit payment by sponsorsfor travel expenses incurred by members and their associated persons whenattending training or educational meetings held in the city or place wherethe main office of a sponsor is located, or when making ``due diligence''trips to inspect the sponsor itself or the properties owned and/or managedby the sponsor. <T3>See </T3>SR-NASD-86-22, at 26-27.The Commission has twice sought comment on the proposal. First, on August13, 1986, it published notice of the original proposal together with theterms of substance of the proposal in Securities Exchange Act Release No.23527 (August 13, 1986) and in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 29729, August 20, 1986). Second, in responseto an amendment filed by the NASD on August 10, 1987,\5\<NOTE/> the Commission published notice of the amended proposal inSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 24995 (October 5, 1987) and in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> 52 FR 38160, October 14, 1987).\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The NASD filed three amendments to its original proposalwith the Commission, on the following dates: (1) May 15, 1987; (2) August10, 1987; and (3) March 22, 1988. These amendments, respectively: (a) Amendsection 5(e) to provide that members' in-house sales incentive programsare permissible subject to the condition that sponsors neither participatein nor contribute to, those programs; (b) amend section 5(f) to clarifythat that section applies to cash compensation only and to clarify thatmembers may not require sponsors to reimburse the expenses of managingand funding in-house sales incentive programs; and (c) amend section 5(e)to specify that the prohibition encompassed in that section is intendedto apply to non-cash sales incentive items, and is not intended to prohibita member or associated person from receiving non-cash compensation in theform of securities for its participation in the public offering.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Commission's notice of October 5, 1987 solicited commenton the revisions made in the May and August amendments. The Commissiondid not solicit comment on the March 22, 1988, amendment because that amendmentmerely conformed the language of section 5(e) to the original intent ofthe NASD drafting committee.The Commission received 24 letters of comment on the proposal.\7\<NOTE/> Four commentators supported the proposal,\8\<NOTE/> and the remaining commentators opposed the proposal. Commentatorsfavoring the proposal agreed with the NASD that non-cash sales incentiveprograms other than in-house programs operated by the members themselvesdeprive members of supervisory control over their own sales forces to thedetriment of public investors, and should be prohibited. Commentators opposingthe proposal generally argued that: (1) Members should not be prohibitedfrom accepting non-cash sales incentives offered by DPP sponsors becauseto do so would deprive members of the discretion, which they currentlyexercise, to approve or disapprove sales incentive programs as they seefit; and (2) the proposed amendment discriminates against sponsors notaffiliated with members.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See </T3>letters from: (1) Alexander J.

As discussed <T3>infra, </T3>the NASD has sought member comment on such a prohibition(<T3>see Notice to Members</T3> 88-17, March 1, 1988). As yet, however,the NASD has not filed with the Commission a proposed rule change thatwould implement that prohibition.The primary objection of the commentators was that, rather than prohibitnon-cash sales incentives, the NASD should simply require further disclosure.For example, the SIA argued that a member should remain free to acceptnon-cash sales incentives from DPP sponsors subject to the conditions that:(1) The member fully disclose its participation in the program; and (2)a management designee of the member formally approve the program for participationby associates of the members.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ SIA letter, at 3. <T3>See </T3>letters from: (1) Oberweis Securities; (2) Zuckert, Scouttandamp; Rasenberger; (3) FSC Securities Corporation; (4) Butcher andamp; Singer,Inc.; (5) John G. Kinnard andamp; Co.; (6) Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood;(7) International Association for Financial Planning; and (8) Gaston Snowandamp; Ely Bartlett.The NASD, however, contends that the prohibition against the acceptanceof non-cash sales incentives encompassed in the proposal is necessary andappropriate because the current regulations, adopted in April 1984,\1\\1\<NOTE/> have proven insufficient to arrest the direct solicitationof associated persons by sponsors of DPPs. Specifically, the NASD has foundthat:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ Current sections 5(e) and (f) of Appendix F were approvedby the Commission on April 11, 1984. Securities Exchange Act Release No.20844 (April 11, 1984), 49 FR 15041.<ITAG tagnum="21">[D]espite the April, 1984 amendments to Appendix F, supervisory controlof associated persons by members remained a serious problem because, amongother things, sponsors generally utilize direct appeals to registered representatives,making it difficult for memers to adequately control the participationof their registered representatives in non-cash sales incentive programs.\1\\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ SR-NASD-86-22, at 9.Indeed, the NASD has concluded that the very structure of the sales incentiveprograms offered by sponsors deprives the member of control over its associates'participation in those programs. The member has no control over the natureof the sales incentives offered to its associates. It plays no part inselecting the DPP products whose sales will trigger eligibility for thesales incentive bonus. Finally, it has no control over the sales literaturethat sponsors distribute to associated persons in an effort to advertisecertain bonuses.Moreover, the NASD has concluded that sales incentives in the public marketfor DPPs have become so prevalent that many members are not in a positionto refuse to pass on non-cash sales incentives to their associated persons.The NASD has found that associates attracted by a particular sales incentiveprogram often seek to induce their employer to participate in the salesincentive program; \1\\3\<NOTE/> further, there is sometimes an implicit or explicit threatthat those associated persons will seek employment elsewhere should theemployer decline to participate.\1\\4\<NOTE/> In light of this threat of defections by associated personsshould the member not adopt a particular program, the NASD believes thatits members do <T3>not</T3> in fact have discretion to refuse to permit associated personsto participate in non-cash incentive programs offered by sponsors.\1\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ Letter from Frank J. Formica, Vice President, CorporateFinancing Department, National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,to Michael J. Simon, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation,Securities and Exchange Commission, at 2.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Letter from Planners Financial Services, Inc., at 5-7.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ SR-NASD-86-22, at 9.The Commission recognizes the serious questions raised by an absolute banon non-cash sales incentives. Nevertheless, in weighing whether such aban is necessary and appropriate under the Act the Commission believesthat the NASD has appropriately considered alternative approaches. TheCommission does not disagree with the NASD's conclusion that, based onthe NASD's experience in the last four years, a disclosure approach wouldnot prove effective. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriateto defer to the NASD's judgment that the proposed prohibition is necessaryto restore to its members supervisory control over the participation oftheir associated persons in non-cash sales incentive programs.The second objection voiced by the commentators was that the proposed amendmentdiscriminates against independent sponsors and in favor of sponsors affiliatedwith members.\1\\6\<NOTE/> The commentators' concern is premised on the view that: (1)The NASD will be unable to detect instances in which an affiliated sponsorcontributes monetarily to, or otherwise influences, a member's in-housesales incentive program; and (2) members will structure their sales incentiveprograms to reward associates for sales of proprietary products only, evenif the affiliated sponsor is effectively prohibited from participatingin the member's sales incentive program.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See</T3> letters from : (1) JMB Realty Corporation, at 1-4; (2) GastonSnow andamp; Ely Bartlett, at 1-3; and (3) Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagherandamp; Flom, at 1-3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>See:</T3> (1) JMB letter, at 2; (2) Gaston, Snow letter, at 2; and(3) Skadden, Arps letter, at 2.The essence of this objection is not that the proposed amendment, if enforced,would have a discriminatory impact; rather, the objection is that the proposedamendment is unenforceable. In this regard, the NASD has assured Commissionstaff that it intends to monitor member compliance with the proposal bypolicing the separation between the operations of its members and theiraffiliates to ensure that a sponsoring affiliate does not influence anin-house sales incentive program adopted by a member.\1\\8\<NOTE/> Indeed, the NASD has developed procedures to test the effectivenessof the procedures adopted by member firms to divorce the operations ofthe firms from those of the firms' affiliates.\1\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Telephone conversation between Suzanne E.

The NASDhas found that the in-house sales incentive programs sponsored by its membersare generally structured to reward associates for sales of a variety ofproducts, not just for sales of the proprietary product sponsored by themember's affiliate.\2\\0\<NOTE/> The NASD has stated that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ As far as the NASD is aware, the only sales incentiveprograms designed to reward associates solely for the sales of proprietaryDPPs, are those managed by members who sell only that proprietary DPP.These members necessarily award sales incentives only for the sale of thatproduct.

[Noticeto Members 88-17 (March 1, 1988)]. Further, as noted above, the NASD hasfiled with the Commission a proposed amendment to the Corporate FinancingInterpretation of Article III, section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice,that would similary prohibit the acceptance of non-cash compensation inconnection with the distribution of any public offering of securities.The Commission is approving that proposed rule change concurrently withthis one. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26186 (October 14, 1988).For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rulechange is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules andregulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirementsof section 15A, and the rules and regulations thereunder.It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19 (b)(2) of the Act, thatthe above-mentioned proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved.For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegatedauthority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated October 14, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Shirely E.
