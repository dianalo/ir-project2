The affirmation was made at the weekly cabinet session chairedby King Fahd and reported by Information Minister Ali al-Shaer.   He said Saudi Arabia ``affirms anew its keenness to abide by theOPEC quota as soon as other members of the organization adhered totheir prescribed quotas.''   He added that the kingdom also affirmed ``full consolidation''of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ``in thisdirection and keenness to preserve cohesion of the organization.''   Oil industry sources have reported that Saudi Arabia hasrecently been producing about 6 million barrels of oil a day, farabove its OPEC quota of 4.343 million barrels.   Saudi Arabia, the leading member of the 13-nation cartel and theworld's largest oil exporter, indirectly confirmed these reportswhen it served notice after last week's Cabinet meeting that itwill not freeze its output while others were violating their quotas.   The sharply worded statement stressed the Saudis' belief thatadherence to the OPEC quota system was the ``best way to restorefull stability'' on the world oil market.   The Saudis' stiff statements have triggered speculation thatthey might pull out of the cartel it helped found 25 years ago. ButSaudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer has denied that.   A glut has pushed down prices by about $6 a barrel from OPEC'sbenchmark of $18 a barrel in recent weeks to a two-year low. Pricesrose on Monday.   Industry sources believe that the Saudis' production increase,which helped depress prices, was primarily aimed at pressuring OPECmembers who are over-producing to curb their output before thebi-annual ministerial session Nov. 21 in Vienna. The conferencewill review production and pricing problems.   The respected Middle East Economic Survey, published in Nicosia,said Monday: ``The purpose of Saudi Arabia's `upside swing' ... isobviously therapeutic: that is to say it is designed to hasten areturn to OPEC production discipline by advancing the point in timewhen the pain factor will be sufficient to break up the logjam ofentrenched antagonistic positions among member governments and pavethe way towards a new agreement.''   The weekly newsletter noted that efforts to curb over-productionby Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates were also ``elements ofan overall solution.''   Iran and Iraq, which badly need oil revenue for post-warreconstruction, are producing more than their quotas.   Iraq, which has refused to accept an OPEC quota of 1.5 millionbarrels a day, is producing an estimated 2.7 million barrels a dayand has said it plans to boost that.   It initially demanded parity with Iran, which has a quota of2.36 million barrels a day, but has now made clear it seeks a farhigher level.   Oil sources said that Iran hiked production for a ``testperiod'' in mid-September to around 2.9 million barrels a dayfollowing the gulf war cease-fire Aug. 20.   But they said Iran's war-damaged oil industry was clearly notable to sustain that production level and has fallen back to adaily output of around 2.4 million to 2.5 million barrels.   Middle East Economic Survey noted that OPEC's prices andstrategy committees will meet Oct. 20, probably in Madrid, todiscuss the crisis.   It noted that a solution ``will be aided by the fact that thetime has certainly arrived when volume maximization at the expenseof price is totally self-defeating.''   The newsletter said that a new OPEC production agreement, hikingthe ceiling to an overall 19 million barrels a day, more than 2million barrels above the current limit, was likely.   By accommodating members who want higher production, withoutcutting other producers' output ceilings, ``this would represent acutback of some 2 million barrels a day from current OPEC output,which now appears to be running somewhere in the region of 21million barrels a day,'' the newsletter said.</TEXT></DOC>
