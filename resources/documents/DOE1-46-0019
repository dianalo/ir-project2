National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)is a function of how durable these systems are in light of projectedlevels of stress. Emergency Preparedness in 1987 is not just a matterof--can they deliver food, water, energy and other essentials--but canthey deliver the vital information necessary to maintain corporate functionof our country. 'Communication stamina' is a function of 'probabilityof survival' when faced with stress. This report provides an overviewof the enhancements to a fiber-optic communication system/installationthat will increase durability. These enhancements are grouped, basedon their value in protecting the system, such that a Multitier Specificationis created that presents multiple levels of hardness. Mitigation of effectsdue to high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) and gamma radiation,and protection from vandalism and weather events are discussed in thereport. The report is presented in two volumes. Volume I presents theMultitier Specification in a format that is usable for management review.The attributes of specified physical parameters, and the levels of protectionstated in Volume I, are discussed in more detail in Volume II.</TEXT></DOC>
