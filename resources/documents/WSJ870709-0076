About 1,000 employees would be affected, the company said. Armstrong Tire, based in Des Moines, is a unit of New Haven-based Armtek Corp.    Paul C. James, president of Armstrong Tire, said he told the president of the United Rubber Workers Union Local 164 that the closure would be in full accordance with terms of a 1985 collective bargaining agreement.    The company had asked the union to come up with a cost-cutting program that would make the plant competitive after Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co., a major competitor with a plant near Armstrong's, succeeded in attaining one with its union. According to Mr. James, &quot;the proposal we received fell far short of the goal to keep this plant competitive.&quot;    Mr. James said the company is &quot;still waiting to see what the union wants to do&quot; within the next six months. He added that it's too soon to tell if the union will move to open negotiations.    An official of the local rubber workers' union couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
