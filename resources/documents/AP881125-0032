Radicals battled police in streets and alleyways around DonggukUniversity in eastern Seoul about some 2,000 students from 10 Seoulcolleges tried to march out despite freezing temperatures. About1,000 protesters stormed out of the college to bombard troopers withrocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of blazing gasoline.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan,'' protesters shouted. ``Yankee go home''   Several thousand riot police in green combat fatigues and blackvisored helmets ringed the campus to stop students breaking through.Troopers fired volleys of choking tear gas and hurled back rocks andother missiles.   Police had no immediate word on casualties or arrests.   Student leaders at an earlier campus rally denounced Chun'sapology on Wednesday for corruption and human rights abuses. Leadersdemanded the former president be arrested and prosecuted fornumerous alleged crimes.   Protesters also denounced President Roh Tae-woo and demanded healso be punished. Speakers told the cheering crowd that Roh wasguilty of corruption and was trying to protect Chun.   Protesters burned an effigy of Roh before marching out withbanners and flags to try and parade through the city. ``Punish RohTae-woo,'' protesters chanted.   Buddhisht monks armed with firebombs joined the students in thefighting. Chun has taken refuge in a remote Buddhist monastery onthe east coast, and the monks claimed his presence there was adesecration of a holy place.   ``Drive out Chun from our sacred temple,'' the monks chanted.   Chun, in a nationally televised speech Wednesday, apologized forabuses under his seven-year authoritarian rule. Chun said he wassurrendering his personal property and going into internal exile.   Chun has denied any personal corrutpion, but some of hisrelatives and associates have been convicted of or charged withembezzlement and other offenses.   Dissident groups refused to accept the apology as sufficent andsaid Chun must be prosecuted. The main opposition parties have alsosaid further explanation is necessary.   Roh, a former close associate of Chun, is scheduled to make astatement Saturday in which he may pardon the former president or atleast ask for public mercy. The announcement probably would triggerfurther outbursts from radicals and other opposition groups.   Earlier, the presidential office said Roh would appear onnational television tonight to make the statement, but it changedthe day.   ``Enough has been done,'' Roh told governing party officials onThursday. ``As a long friend, I felt deep sorrow for the formerpresident, who had to leave in such a way.''   Roh is trying to defuse public anger against Chun withoutdamaging himself and his government. Many Koreans see the Rohadministration as a continuation of the Chun government.   Roh, a former general who took power in February after winningelections in December, has introduced broad, democratic reforms. Hehas dismantled many of the authoritarian controls imposed by Chun,who took power with military backing in 1980.   North Korea today called Chun's apology ``an offspring ofconspiracy and compromise'' between Chun and the South Koreangovernment.   The official (North) Korean Central News Agency quoted aspokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of theFatherland as saying Chun ``tried to gloss over his shockingmurderous atrocities, including the Kwangju bloodbath and all kindsof irregularities, with the monosyllable word, `I apologize.'''   A 1980 civil uprising in the southern city of Kwangju wasviolently quashed by the military, resulting in the deaths of about200 people.   ``It is preposterous, indeed, to try to dispose of Chun's crimeswith something like an `apology,''' the unidentified spokesman wasquoted as saying.   The two Koreas have remained bitter rivals since the Koreanpeninsula was divided into the communist north and pro-Western southat the end of World War II. Both sides fought the bloody Korean warin 1950-53.</TEXT></DOC>
