While this terrorist scenario has not come true, early this month Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger mentioned that Iranian patrol boats in the Persian Gulf &quot;have machine guns and sometimes Stinger equipment.&quot;    As American armed forces risk their lives to protect our interests in the Persian Gulf, they are increasingly at risk due to Iranian aggression. Should the Iranians enhance their range and effectiveness with American-made Stingers, the most sophisticated portable surface-to-air missiles in the world, U.S. troops in helicopters and aircraft would be further exposed.    American technology must be safeguarded and American lives protected. This does not necessarily translate into strict prohibitions, restrictions and constraints. For example, I support supplying the democratic resistance in Afghanistan and Angola with Stingers, especially with the support of special training and indigenously designed security measures. However, I do not endorse using arms of any kind, particularly Stingers, as tools of diplomacy or symbols of appreciation to foreign governments.    The Reagan administration has applied an arms-for-hostages policy with Iran that has already come back to haunt us. U.S. planners in the gulf now must deal with a threat to American pilots by Iranian Hawk missiles, which are operational largely because the administration shipped Hawk parts to Tehran in an arms deal. Now, the administration is considering supplying Stingers to Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. When will it learn the lessons of history?    In May 1984, the administration attempted to sell Saudi Arabia a shipment of Stingers and met strong congressional opposition. The president finally relied on rarely used emergency powers to provide 400 Stingers to the Saudis. The deal was contingent upon a guaranteed assurance from the Saudis that strict safeguards would be implemented and that U.S. military personnel would deliver the missiles and train the Saudis. Additionally, such security measures as guards, steel vaults and dual storage were agreed to in the letter of offer and acceptance.    But even if stringent safeguards were set up in Bahrain, there are compelling reasons not to sell or transfer Stingers to that government. The Iranians have already obtained Stingers, somehow, despite U.S. precautions, and Bahrain's population is more than 60% Shiite and thus susceptible to Iranian appeals. Iran has twice attempted to destabilize the religious government there and claims a historical right to the land. Kuwait has refused the U.S. any right to use its ports and airfields despite the U.S. risk entailed in reflagging 11 Kuwaiti tankers. It does not seem prudent or practical to provide Stingers to these countries.    Members of Congress and Pentagon officials have taken issue with the administration on this &quot;policy&quot; and have indicated some dissatisfaction, noting the concerns cited above, as well as the Army's limited supply of Stingers for its own use. The Army's recently retired chief of staff, Gen. John Wickham, said that due to terrorist threats, &quot;we anguish over decisions&quot; on who should receive the weapon. If the Iranians use the anti-ship Silkworm missile in the gulf, our own troops will need the Stinger as a defense. Now is not the time simply to give Stingers away to those who request them. The Arab gulf states might be given other weapons that are effective and yet do not pose a terrorist or military threat to our own troops.    President Reagan can help to ensure the safety of American troops in the Persian Gulf by enforcing safeguards or refusing to sell Stinger missiles in specific cases. If the president refuses to exercise this sound judgment, strong support should be given to legislation introduced in the Senate and the House that would prohibit sales or transfers to foreign governments in the Persian Gulf region. This is a constitutional right that Congress may be forced to exercise.    ---   Mr. DeConcini (D., Ariz.) is a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. </TEXT></DOC>
