But behind the scenes,according to federal prosecutors, the schools were conspiringwith students to defraud Uncle Sam of loan funds.   Wilfred's Massachusetts schools have closed, though thecompany continues to operate 30 schools elsewhere. Wilfred,which denies wrongdoing, faces a 12-count mail-fraudindictment, handed up last October by a grand jury in federaldistrict court in Boston. And now Wilfred may be but aharbinger for its huge industry: The federal government andmany states are escalating efforts to crack down on thenation's more than 6,000 trade schools. The crackdown mayhamper the schools' efforts to expand their enrollments byexploiting recent welfare reforms sparked by Congress.</LP><TEXT>   To some, the problem illustrates a pitfall of many fieldsdominated by small businesses. Like many other such fields,the trade-school industry has a low cost of entry andcomparatively few nonfinancial barriers to hanging out ashingle. At the same time, the huge number of players makesit hard to regulate the field.   Still, agencies are trying. Illinois, California, Georgiaand Florida already approved sweeping legislation aimed atcurbing abuses at trade schools. And more than a dozen otherstates, including New York, are working on comparable newlaws.   Not surprisingly, many trade schools hate the changes.&quot;The states are overreacting,&quot; said Stephen Blair, presidentof the National Association of Trade and Technical SchoolsInc., Washington, D.C., an industry-sponsored accreditationagency that represents 1,345 trade schools. &quot;There was anationwide problem,&quot; he concedes, but he insisted that &quot;itrepresented only 3% to 5% of all schools.&quot; The trade group isspending $1 million to lobby against proposed laws affectingtrade schools. Also, it and other accreditation agencies areincreasing their monitoring and analysis of the schools.   But critics say abuses have been rife. Many schools haveshut without fulfilling their obligations to students, who infact are worse off because they are stuck with repaying loansthat financed their tuition. In New York state alone, morethan 120 trade schools have closed in the past three yearswithout fulfilling the enrollment agreement with theirstudents, according to Elizabeth Imholz, an attorneyrepresenting students with claims against schools.   Though most of them are fairly small, for-profitvocational training institutions receive an estimated $2billion a year in federal funds and enroll more than 1.2million students. Their programs purport to teach such skillsas cosmetology, computer programming and truck driving. Butsome people charge many schools don't adequately provide theskills or services advertised and are established to generatequick profits at the expense of mostly low-income studentsand taxpayers.   Nationwide, many of these schools follow a similarstrategy: They recruit low-income individuals, especiallythose on welfare and thus eligible for maximum federal andstate aid. Many welfare recipients will soon be required toenroll in educational training or job-related activities -- aprobable boon for the schools. But before being able to cashin on this next funding surge, schools may face new curbs.   Although criticism of the industry has been steadilymounting for the past five years, the real crackdown beganonly about 18 months ago. For example:   -- The U.S. Justice Department late in 1988 suedContinental Training Services, which operates a chain ofIndiana trucking schools, in federal court in Indianapolisfor $366 million, claiming it didn't qualify for federalgrants and student loans. In Indianapolis, an attorney forthe company didn't return calls seeking comment.   -- The New York attorney general last July obtained anindictment against the owner of Adelphi Institute forallegedly scheming to defraud students and falsifyingbusiness records. The attorney for Adelphi, which isn'trelated to Adelphi University, said the company is in Chapter7 bankruptcy-law proceedings and a trustee was appointed bythe Manhattan Bankruptcy Court. The case in state criminalcourt in Manhattan hasn't gone to trial yet, he said.   -- The U.S. Education Department last year cut off aid tosix Robert Fiance Corp. trade schools in Florida andpenalized the company $1.5 million. The trustee for thecompany, which is going through bankruptcy proceedings in NewYork, said all its schools have closed.   In some instances, students themselves take legal actionagainst trade-school operators. In August 1989, a federaldistrict court jury in Chicago awarded $640,000 in damages toplaintiffs who sued D'or Beauty Schools Inc., Chicago, nowclosed, under the Illinois consumer-fraud act.   On behalf of students in New York, South Brooklyn LegalServices, a federally funded legal-services agency, last yearbrought a class-action suit against MTI Business School ofBrooklyn and its owners in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn,charging the school made false statements to induce studentsto enroll and apply for government aid. Attorneys for MTIrefused to comment. This week in federal Bankruptcy Court inManhattan, Judge Prudence Abram ordered the appointment of atrustee to oversee MTI's bankruptcy case, filed when theschool closed last year.   &quot;The industry has grown too fast,&quot; said Jeffrey Plaut,author of a study sponsored by New York Interface DevelopmentProject Inc., a public policy research group. &quot;There are toomany jurisdictional bodies involved in monitoring thebusiness.&quot;   Alan Alop, a lawyer with the Legal Assistance Foundationof Chicago who is an author of the Illinois bill, and othersare hopeful that laws being enacted will bring about reform.The Illinois law, which went into effect last year, aims toclose down schools with low graduation rates. Schools willhave to disclose all information about their graduation ratesand success at job placement. And students who withdraw fromthese programs will be entitled to tuition refundssubstantially larger than those previously given, Mr. Alopsaid.   ---             Default Rates on Education Loans                                                                                                          2-yr. public colleges                        18%   2-yr. private colleges                       14   4-yr. public colleges                         7   4-yr. private colleges                        7   Trade schools                                33                                                                                                          Source: Department of Education 1987 study</TEXT></DOC>
