Thesepitches come from insurance companies, employee associations, credit cardfirms, banks, savings and loans, credit unions and other businesses promisingto provide special insurance coverage when you need it most.;   Because about67 million Americans -- about 30 percent of all those now living -- willeventually get cancer, buying such special policies might seem like a verysmart move. But according to consumer advocates, these so-called &quot;junk&quot;policies -- cancer, hospital indemnity, death and dismemberment and suchcatastrophic diseases as heart disease and stroke -- are unnecessary,duplicative and far too expensive for the benefits they provide.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  UNHEALTHY BENEFITSINSURANCE AGAINST SPECIFIC, CATASTROPHIC DISEASESISN'T JUST EXPENSIVE -- IT'S ALMOST ALWAYSUNNECESSARY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cover Story; Health andamp; Fitness; See also related article on page 3E of thissection.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Yet Americans, mainly older Americans, buy tens of billions of dollarsworth of these products every year when all they really need is a good,comprehensive health insurance policy or one that adequately supplementsMedicare coverage.;   &quot;It's not as bad as it was a few years ago, becausepeople have gotten wiser, but these policies are still fairly big sellers andeverybody who bought one got taken advantage of,&quot; says Robert Hunter,executive director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization. The salespitch for these policies, he says, plays on people's fears that a disease likecancer will impoverish them.;   &quot;I don't know where people get the ideaMedicare doesn't cover cancer,&quot; says Bonnie Burns, consultant to the HealthInsurance Counseling Advocacy Program for senior citizens. &quot;They looksurprised when you tell them it covers cancer just like it covers anydisease.;   &quot;It's nuts for people to buy that sort of stuff,&quot; Burns continues.&quot;If older people have a Medicare supplement that doesn't cover cancer, theanswer isn't cancer insurance, the answer is a better supplement.&quot;;   Burnssays HICAP has helped reduce the ranks of those buying &quot;junk&quot; policies. HICAP,a statewide program based in Scott's Valley, is funded by the state Departmentof Insurance, administered by the Department of Aging and uses more than 700volunteer counselors to help senior citizens with insurance problems.;   Thereare five basic types of insurance that the average person needs, says Hunterof NICO: comprehensive health, life (if you have dependents), auto,homeowner's or renter's and disability (where it is vital to protect afamily's income).;   &quot;Basically, you don't need anything else. You shouldn'teven consider any policy that covers only part of these,&quot; says Hunter. Aperson should purchase enough life insurance, for instance, to cover thingslike mortgages, education and the like. &quot;It's a lot cheaper to get it all inone place than to buy it piece by piece.&quot;;   The absurdity of insuring for asingle disease, Hunter and others say, is that it forces you to guess whichdisease you might get. If you buy cancer insurance and then you havea heartattack or get hit by a car, the cancer policy is worthless. Comprehensivehealth insurance covers all of these exigencies.;   And, advocates say, somecancer policies may not cover conditions that can develop as a result ofcancer treatment, such as pneumonia. Nor will they cover non-medical expensesoften associated with cancer and other serious diseases, such astransportation, home care and rehabilitation.;   THE problem, consumer groupsagree, stems from the fact that &quot;junk&quot; insurance is virtually unregulatedbecause no one considers it important. And the blizzard of sales pitches fallsheavily on the mailboxes of the elderly.;   &quot;I've never talked to anyone whocarried (comprehensive health) insurance who didn't have enough to cover theircare,&quot; said Lynn Cole, director of patient services for the Santa Clara Countyunit of the American Cancer Society.;   Most inquiries she gets are frompeople diagnosed with cancer who do not have comprehensive health insurance.And cancer insurance won't help them, because companies offeringcatastrophic-disease insurance will not cover someone who already has thedisease.;   Cole noted that California has a major-risk health insuranceprogram that helps obtain coverage for those who are otherwise uninsurable --&quot;including people with cancer.&quot;;   However, cancer is now considered the mostcurable of the chronic diseases, and that's beginning to be reflected in theattitude of mainstream health insurance companies. Cole says one will eveninsure people who are &quot;mildly malignant,&quot; such as those with basal cell skincancer.;   Don Gartner, assistant district attorney in Santa Cruz County whoprosecuted a number of area insurance agents in the late 1980s for sellingmultiple policies to elderly people, points out that California law now makesit illegal for any agent or insurer knowingly to sell policies that willprovide more than 100 percent coverage.;   It is not the purpose of insuranceto permit a person who breaks a hip to make money by collecting more than hismedical bills, Gartner says. Before the law passed, he recalled, one San Josewoman on a limited income was sold 21 Medicare supplements and other policiesover a period of 2 1/2 years.;   A U.S. General Accounting Office report in1988 reached much the same conclusion as consumer advocates have: &quot;The mostefficient use of insurance premium dollars is for protection against a widerange of risks. . . . Hospital indemnity and specified disease polices are oflimited value. They provide narrow coverage, fixed-dollar benefit levelswithout protection against inflation, are conditioned on confinement in ahospital or contracting a specified disease.&quot;;    FOR the insurers who offerthem, dread disease, hospitalization and accidental death polices are moneymakers, in many cases paying out less than 45 cents in benefits for everydollar they take in.;   Hospital indemnity insurance provides benefits onlywhile one is in the hospital, usually $100 to $200 a day, and generallyhospital stays are not that long. The average hospital stay for a cancerpatient, for example, is 13 days.;   HICAP's Burns told of an 86-year-old SanJose widow who was paying $2,570 a year for a hospitalization plan on whichshe collected a total of $600 -- and then only because she had a fall and wentto the hospital for three days before she was sent to a nursing home.;   Somehave lost even these modest benefits without knowing it, Burns says, when theywere transferred to a nursing facility within the hospital. The fine printoften provides for exclusions in those cases.;   Ann Eowan, spokeswoman forthe Association of California Life Insurance Companies, said the industry hasdeveloped these policies in response to consumer demand.;   &quot;Many people feelvery healthy and only want to be protected against the worst,&quot; she says. &quot;Theydon't want to pay premiums for general health insurance. There's nothinginherently wrong with this kind of insurance.&quot;;   But Richard Coorsh,spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America said, &quot;Nicheinsurance should never be construed as a replacement for comprehensive medicalcare coverage. On the other hand, it can provide additional resources, whichthe consumer can use as he sees fit.;   &quot;It boils down to comparing featuresand prices and an assessment of whether you need this kind of extrainsurance,&quot; Coorsh added. He also suggested that consumers compare therelative financial health of any insurance company -- through ratingscompanies such as Moody's, Standard andamp; Poor's and A.M. Best Co. -- beforepurchasing any policy.;   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners,reacting to what it sees as an area of potential abuse, will hold a series ofhearings starting in December on the whole range of these policies.;   &quot;Themain concern is the low level of benefits,&quot; said spokesman Kevin Hennosy.&quot;This is an issue that has raised the attention of regulators.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ED POPE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911106  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,286  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 6, 199100311105,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
