Kennedy on a contract fromU.S. organized crime, but French records show two of them were notin Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.   One of the three men, Sauveur Pironti, also denied the allegationin an interview published Wednesday by the Marseilles newspaper LeProvencal.   It quoted him as saying ``I was not in Dallas, but in themilitary in Toulon,'' and said he displayed a military servicerecord showing he was based on a mine sweeper in Toulon from Oct.16, 1962, to April 16, 1964.   ``I believe at that time my friend Sarti was being held inBaumettes (prison in Marseilles) and (Roger) Bocagnani was in prisonat Fort du Ha in Bordeaux,'' the newspaper quoted Pironti as saying.   According to the two-hour Central Television program ``The MenWho Killed Kennedy,'' broadcast Tuesday night, Lucien Sarti was wasshot to death in Mexico in 1972 and Bocagnani is believed to beworking in the Colombian cocaine trade.   French Navy headquarters confirmed the dates of service in Toulonand said Pironti, 46, could not have been in Dallas on the day ofthe assassination. The Justice Ministry said Bocagnani was in a jailcell in Marseille on that day.   Kennedy was killed as he rode in a motorcade through Dallas. LeeHarvey Oswald was charged with the shooting, but Jack Ruby shot andkilled him two days later. The Warren Commission said Oswald actedalone in the assassination.   There have been many theories over the years that Oswald was notthe killer or was part of a conspiracy in which assortedorganizations, governments and personalities were involved.   Central Television, a company in Britain's commercial IndependentTelevision network, said its report was based on a four-year inquiryby Steve Rivele, an American writer and researcher, and NigelTurner, the documentary's British director.   Rivele said the three men were hired through organized crimecircles on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, but theprogram produced no direct evidence of a Corsican connection.   According to Rivele, he got on the Corsican trail by interviewingChristian David, a French drug smuggler held at the Leavenworthfederal prison in Kansas.   In exchange for help in hiring an attorney, Rivele said, Davidtold him he was offered the contract and refused it, then graduallyrevealed the identities of those involved.   The American journalist said he persuaded a contact in the U.S.Drug Enforcement Agency, not identified, to give him someone whocould corroborate David's story. He identified that man as MichelNicoli, a government witness living under a false identity.   Nicoli, interviewed with his face obscured, said he heard Sarti,Bocagnoni and Pironti were the killers in 1966, when he lived inBuenos Aires. He said he believed it to be true but gave noindication that he had direct evidence of their involvement.   David's lawyer was interviewed and said the his client had givenhim a sealed envelope to be opened only if he was freed.   Le Provencal said Pironti, a Corsican, has lived in Marseillessince his release four years ago after a prison term for drugsmuggling.   It quoted him as saying he spoke for Sarti and Bocagnani, ``and Ican tell you that if they were in Marseille they would be with mehere tonight. This business ... is the most incredible misadventureof my life.''</TEXT></DOC>
