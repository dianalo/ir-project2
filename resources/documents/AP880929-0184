She said the House ``caved in'' to the NRA's lobbying againstthe legislation in an election year, and added that some lawmakers``turned tail'' after promising Handgun Control Inc. they wouldback the waiting period.   Mrs. Brady is vice chair of the gun control organization, whichlobbied along with law enforcement organizations for a seven-daywaiting period with an optional police background check.   Mrs. Brady contended that the NRA leadership, which oncesupported waiting periods, has become more extreme and no longerrepresents its membership.   NRA president Joe Foss, who was in the audience for Mrs. Brady'stalk, said afterwards, ``I'm no extremist.'' He said theorganization's leadership does represent its members, adding, ``Iam out there with them. I have a pretty good pulse.   ``Whenever you lose, people always say it wasn't a fair fight.''   Foss, a former World War II flying ace and a onetime SouthDakota governor, was elected to a two-year term as NRA president inApril.   Mrs. Brady, the wife of presidential press secretary JamesBrady, spoke at the National Press Club. Her husband was seriouslywounded when shot in the head by John W. Hinckley Jr. in his March30, 1981, assassination attempt on the president.   The House voted 228-182 on Sept. 16 to delete the proposedseven-day waiting period from an anti-drug bill, despite thewell-coordinated police-gun control group lobbying effort.   The vote, which followed a strong NRA campaign against thelanguage, substituted a plan designed to allow gun dealers toquickly identify convicted felons seeking to buy pistols. The Housebill ordered the Justice Department to devise an identificationsystem in six months and present it to Congress.   The Brady forces argued that criminals could easily buy guns inthe 28 states without a waiting period, while the NRA said awaiting period would only hurt law-abiding citizens.   While the House passed the overall drug bill, the Senate has yetto consider its own anti-drug legislation.   Although both sides concede the chance for a waiting period isdead for the year, senators could decide to approve anidentification system.   Mrs. Brady said in her speech, ``I'm disappointed at the caliberof members of Congress who didn't have the guts to speak up to oneof the most powerful lobbies in Washington. I have experienced thepower of the NRA.''   Predicting that lawmakers would have less ``fear'' of supportinggun control in a non-election year, Mrs. Brady vowed to try againfor the waiting period in 1989.   ``Until Congress comes to terms with its own conscience, moreblood is going to be spilled,'' she said, referring to killingswith handguns.   ``The law enforcement community is mad. They're ready to do someheavy lobbying. After the vote on the Brady bill they were irate.''   Purchasing guns, she said, ``shouldn't be as easy as buyingbubble gum.''</TEXT></DOC>
