The company declined to estimate fourth-quarter financial results. A spokesman said Norton plans to report the results in about a month.    Norton attributed the charge to further deterioration of its depressed petroleum business; the write-down of its $30 million investment in Vitesse Electronics Corp., a start-up electronics-part concern, and actions to reduce overhead necessitated by its depressed industrial markets. Norton makes abrasives, ceramics and chemicals and, through joint ventures, supplies drilling products and services to the energy industry.    In the 1985 fourth quarter, the company had net loss of $165.1 million, including a net charge of $167.5 million from restructuring costs, on sales of $296.7 million. For all of 1985, the loss was $129.8 million on sales of $1.19 billion.    In the first nine months of 1986, Norton earned $40.5 million, or $1.99 a share, on sales of $848.2 million.    The 300 people to be dismissed include some management personnel, Norton said. The company has about 15,000 employees world-wide.    As part of the restructuring program, Norton said, it plans to consolidate its three ceramics-related businesses: industrial ceramics, high-performance ceramics and its materials division.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Norton closed at $40.375 a share, up $1.375. </TEXT></DOC>
