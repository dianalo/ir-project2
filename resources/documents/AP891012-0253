(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When millions of gallons of oil blackenedAlaska's Prince William Sound, the whole world knew where it camefrom _ a jagged rip in the hull of the grounded Exxon Valdez.   But when a fisherman finds his fishing grounds befouled or abeachcomber's favorite stretch of sand is soaked with oil, it'soften a mystery.   That's where the super sleuths of oil-spill investigations comein: The U.S. Coast Guard Oil Identification Laboratory.   The laboratory, often working with dissipated evidence and fewclues, has helped track down those responsible for hundreds of oilspills nationwide, from one or two gallons to hundreds of thousands.   The laboratory uses sophisticated tests to identify the type ofoil and pinpoint its source, a task complicated by the fact thateven oils of the same weight have different chemical``fingerprints,'' depending on where the original crude was pumpedout of the ground and how it was stored.   ``It's like crime-solving in which all of the pieces of evidencehave to fit together,'' said Martha S. Hendrick, the chief chemistand the only civilian in a lab that employs nine othermarine-science technicians.   The Coast Guard was given jurisdiction for determining liabilityfor oil spills by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972,which created a $6 million to $7 million revolving fund to coverthe costs of cleanups. Additional money is collected from thosefound responsible for the spills.   The lab opened at the University of Connecticut's Avery Pointcampus in 1978, moved to Washington in 1980, and returned to thecampus in 1986.   In that time, the laboratory, which has an annual budget ofabout $440,000, has helped investigate more than 3,000 oil spillsand seen its case load grow each year amid heightened concern aboutthe environment.   Recent spills it investigated include the 11-million-gallonspill from the Exxon tanker in March; a 288,000-gallon spill by theGreek tanker World Prodigy off Newport, R.I., on June 23; and the306,000-gallon spill from the Uruguayan tanker Presidente offClaymont, Del., on June 24.   The lab can also help exonerate those being blamed for a spill.   Two technicians who assisted in the Alaska investigation helpedsave Exxon $97 million in cleanup costs when they found thatseveral thousand gallons in haddock- and salmon-fishing groundsdidn't come from the Exxon Valdez.   ``We have been very busy since the Exxon Valdez incident becauseeveryone has become much more aware of pollution by petroleumproducts,'' said Cmdr. Larry H. Gibson, 40, who has headed thelaboratory for two years.   Most investigations into oil spills, however, have far fewerclues than the Exxon Valdez disaster.   In 1987, a 50- to 75-gallon spill fouled the Willamette Rivernear Portland, Ore., leaving Coast Guard officials with a slick,but no suspects. A year later, the lab linked the spill to oilfound near an intake valve on the underside of a tanker that was indry dock for repairs. The tanker's owner agreed to pay for thecleanup.   ``A lot of people are very surprised when they learn that theoil did come from their vessel or their facility and theyimmediately cooperate once they're shown the evidence,'' Gibsonsaid. ``Some other people fight it tooth and nail.''   Field investigators take 4-ounce samples from the spill, alongwith samples from possible sources in the area.   Back at the lab, six to eight tablespoon-sized batches aretested: gas chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, fluorescencespectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and high-performance liquidspectroscopy. The combination of tests allows scientists tocross-check their results.   The gas chromatograph, for example, separates the chemicals thatmake up the oil based on their different boiling points, which inturn helps scientists determine the oil's ``fingerprints,'' Gibsonsaid.   ``We compare the intrinsic chemical traits of the spilled oilagainst all of the suspects to pick out the source of the spill,''he said.   Spills can consist of dozens of kinds of oil, from the lighterkerosene and jet fuels to the thick No. 6 oil used in heavyindustry. Oil of the same weight can have slightly differentcharacteristics.   ``There are thousands and thousands of compounds in anyparticular oil sample and the makeup of the sample depends on theoil fill it came from and the conditions of formation,'' Gibsonsaid.   ``Also it depends on any refinery processes that the oil hasbeen through. Any time you mix a batch of oil with another batch ofoil, it's going to change the fingerprint a little bit and that'swhere we can really get down to pinpointing the source of thepollution.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Oct. 16</NOTE></DOC>
