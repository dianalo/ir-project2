The director of the Bahrami children's hospital in downtownTehran said about 60 children were inside the building when anIraqi missile blasted into it at about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday.   ``All of us were working normally. There was no alarm,''Mohammad Reza Tayayori told reporters.   ``We have recovered eight bodies of children up to now,'' hesaid, speaking through an interpreter. ``Three are still missingand we fear they are buried under the debris.''   He said he could not give the number of injured as they had beenmoved to several other hospitals since.   But a doctor at the hospital said about 20 children wereseriously injured. Tahayori said there were about 60 children inthe hospital at the time of the attack. Normally the hospital hasabout 250 patients, but most were evacuated when the shellingbetween Iran and Iraq flared anew Feb. 29.   He said three nurses also were killed and 20 were seriouslyinjured. The group of foreign reporters was led over a huge pile ofdebris that was once the kindergarten ward.   In the street, a crowd stared at the visiting reporters.   A bearded old man shouted frantically, ``Where is the UnitedNations? Is this human rights?'' His cries were translated by aninterpreter.   A young man who spoke English said he heard a ``terrible sound''before the impact, then saw a huge cloud of smoke rising over thesite.   ``I was shocked. I saw a woman lying on the street, her face allbloodied.'' he said.   As the journalists returned from the trip, they were told thatall would have to leave Iran by Thursday. The reporters had beeninvited to Iran in the wake of alleged Iraqi chemical-bomb attackson Kurdish villages in Iraq.   An official of the Ministry of Islamic Guidance, which organizesall press visits, said the reporters were asked to leave to ensuretheir safety.   He said suthorities expected the Iraqis to a launch massivemissile attacks on Tehran on Friday, the day Iranians elect a newparliament.   Newspapers have been carrying daily commentaries warning thatBaghdad will seek to disrupt the elections by making residentsleave the capital on that day.   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last week called on citizens to goto the polls ``even if they are under a barrage of Iraqi misile andbomb attacks'' to ``perform their Islamic and divine duty'' andvote.</TEXT></DOC>
