<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-1054 </DOCNO><TEXT>High spin states in /sup 76,78/Kr were populated via the /sup 63/Cu(/sup16/O,n2p)/sup 76/Kr and /sup 64/Ni(/sup 18/O,4n)/sup 78/Kr reactionsat 69 MeV and {gamma}-{gamma} coincidence data were collected. New bandcrossings and quasi-particle alignments are discussed. Moments of inertiaof bands built on intrinsic excitations are found to be exceptionallyconstant with spin and equal to the rigid-body value, indicating strongsuppression of coherent pairing correlations. The coexistence of suchbands with bands of reduced, superfluid moments of inertia suggests theappearance of a new phenomenon: phase coexistence.</TEXT></DOC>
