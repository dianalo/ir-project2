A decree expected to be approved by the cabinet this monthallows police to administer tests for drunken driving. Policeare now able to arrest only those who are clearly drunkbecause the Public Works Ministry hasn't established themaximum blood-alcohol level for drivers.   Other measures include a limit on the time nightspots canserve alcohol, a publicity campaign on the dangers of drivingafter drinking and earlier closing times for discotheques.   A commission will also study changing the highway code sothat young people would have to wait two years after gettingtheir license before driving cars capable of going fasterthan 80 miles an hour.                                                                                                          AIRBUS REBUTS INDIA                                                                                                          Airbus Industrie derided as &quot;fantasy-like&quot; accusations byIndia's top investigating agency that Airbus directors bribedformer Indian government officials to win a $1.47 billioncontract. The European aircraft-manufacturing consortiumthreatened legal action against whoever originated theaccusations made last Thursday by the Central Bureau ofInvestigation in New Delhi. Airbus deplored &quot;the systematiccampaign of denigration against {Airbus} in India.&quot;                                                                                                          WORLD CRIME                                                                                                          Americans are more likely to fall victim to crime than thecitizens of 12 other nations, according to a survey publishedby the Dutch Justice Ministry; Japanese are the leastcrime-prone. The survey found the Netherlands the mostcrime-prone nation in Western Europe but noted that the Dutchfigure was mainly caused by a relatively high number ofbicycle thefts. Of U.S. residents interviewed for the report,28.8% said they had been victimized by at least one crimeagainst themselves or their property in 1988. In Japan, only9.3% of those interviewed said they had fallen victim to acrime.                                                                                                          JAPAN POSTPONES NTT BREAKUP                                                                                                          The Japanese government will wait five years beforedeciding whether to break up Nippon Telegraph andamp; TelephoneCorp. A government advisory council suggested last month thatstate-controlled NTT should be broken into three separatecompanies offering local, long-distance and mobile-telephoneservices. But the Finance Ministry, in charge of offering NTTstock to the public, strongly opposed a breakup, claiming itwould hurt NTT shareholders.                                                                                                          BURMESE HEROIN                                                                                                          A U.S. narcotics official said there had been an explosionof opium and heroin production in Burma. Melvyn Levitsky,assistant secretary of state for narcotics issues, estimatedBurma's 1989 opium production at 2,625 tons against 1,280tons in 1988. He said that there were no checks on poppyproduction in Burma and that warlords were controllingproducing areas. He concluded: &quot;Drug cartels in the last fewyears have been winning.&quot;                                                                                                          MONEY FOR ETHIOPIA                                                                                                          The European Community is to grant and lend Ethiopia$318.8 million to develop agriculture, industry, mining andenergy, the Ethiopian News Agency said. The agency said themoney would be handed out in the five years after 1991. Itsaid EC delegate Benno Haffner told President Mengistu HaileMariam at a meeting last week that 90% of the money would bea grant. The agency said the EC had granted or loanedEthiopia $597.7 million between 1986 and 1990.                                                                                                          FRANCE'S CHAMPAGNE CRISIS                                                                                                          The French champagne industry is heading for a crisisbecause vine growers aren't supplying enough grapes tochampagne producers.   Despite negotiations for new contracts, 19,000 privatevineyard owners in eastern France haven't guaranteed tosupply major champagne houses with enough grapes for thisyear's production, industry officials said. Philippe LeTixerant, spokesman for the association of growers andproducers, said the vineyard owners had pledged 43% of thetotal champagne crop to producers, the lowest amount theyhave ever contracted to sell.   Private vine growers are seeking to cash in on the rapidlyexpanding market by producing and marketing their ownchampagne instead of selling their grapes to the majorhouses.   The Comite Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne, theproducers' trade association, meets today to try to salvagean agreement and prevent what major producers say could beanarchy in the champagne market.

Addressing the opening session of the First InternationalConference on Environmental Protection of the Himalayas, SirEdmund Hillary warned that the mountains were threatened bydeforestation and tourism. &quot;The living standards {of theHimalayan people} are increasing,&quot; he said, &quot;but thebeautiful tracks and valleys have been littered and theforests destroyed.&quot; . . . Britain's Prince Philip, head ofthe World Wide Fund for Nature, said the consequences ofunimpeded population growth would be more devastating to theworld than a nuclear holocaust. He said political leadersmust &quot;face the facts&quot; and make serious efforts to solve thepopulation crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
