These conditions are fulfilled when bothlower hybrid waves and ohmic heating transformer are used to ramp-upthe plasma current. In this paper, we present the results of such a scenariowhich has been carried out on Petula-B (R = 0.72 m, a = 0.17 m) by meansof 1.3 GHz or 3.7 GHz RF system. For the purpose of these studies, plasmacurrent or loop voltage are successively feedback controlled.</TEXT></DOC>
