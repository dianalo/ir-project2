The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said in its annual reportreleased Tuesday that the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration should abandon plans to build an advanced solidrocket motor because the money could be better used to makeimprovements in the orbiter stage of the space shuttle.   But NASA administrator James C. Fletcher said development of theadvanced rocket had been thoroughly debated within the space agencyand ``I haven't changed my mind on that.''   Fletcher said NASA wants to develop a second source manufacturerfor space shuttle solid rockets so the agency is never again leftwithout a reliable rocket engine as it was after the Challengeraccident.   ``We don't want to be stuck with the situation we got stuck with(before),'' said Fletcher. ``We need to have the option of changingcontractors.''   The Challenger accident, in which seven astronauts were killed,occurred when a solid rocket booster leaked hot gas and caused thespacecraft to explode 73 seconds after launch from the KennedySpace Center, Fla. on Jan. 28, 1986. The accident forced a totalredesign and testing of the solid rocket manufactured by MortonThiokol Inc., and caused the space shuttle fleet to be grounded for38 months. Thiokol remains NASA's only supplier of the solid rocketbooster.   Fletcher said that because of this experience, the agency wantsto develop an improved, more powerful solid rocket that could bemanufactured by more than one contractor.   ``We need the option to change contractors quickly,'' he said.``You would like to have somebody to fall back on.''   Joseph F. Sutter, a former Boeing vice president and chairman ofthe safety advisory board, said that the panel of experts felt thatthe redesign of the Morton Thiokol rocket had ``produced a boosterthat is safe'' and that efforts to build another booster would meanthat it would have to be extensively tested to develop the samelevel of safety.   Sutter said that if building the new rocket takes funds awayfrom other shuttle improvements, ``we feel like it would bedegrading to safety.''   The committee chairman also said he felt NASA was forced intobuilding the new booster by congress. Sutter suggested this was amistake and that congress ``should get the hell out of that.''   Richard Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space flight,said that though the panel made ``good points,'' the space agencydecided to build the new rocket because the shuttle ``needs theperformance.''   The new rocket planned by NASA would enable the shuttle to carryan additional 12,000 pounds into orbit, he said.   Also, said Truly, there is no assurance that the rest of theshuttle ``would see those dollars'' if NASA decided to not buildthe new rocket.   Plans call for NASA to spend $1.5 billion through fiscal year1994 to develop the new rocket motor. A number of rocket companiesbesides Morton Thiokol are competing for the rocket contract.   The aerospace safety advisory panel is made up of 14 independentexperts who monitor safety issues throughout NASA and make annualrecommendations.   Other recommendations by the panel included:   _ Modify the structure of the shuttle orbiter so that thespacecraft is not as sensitive to adverse wind conditions duringlaunch. Upper level winds have caused delays in the last two spaceshuttle launches.   _ Modifications to increase reliability and safety of theliquid-fueled rockets on the space shuttle.   _ Make certain that the final plans for the Space StationFreedom include a emergency rescue vehicle that would enableastronauts on the station to quickly return to Earth.   _ That a new space suit be developed for use on the spacestation.</TEXT></DOC>
