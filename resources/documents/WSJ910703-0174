Instead, it already seems to be having the oppositeeffect, becoming a focus for their disagreements.</LP><TEXT>   As a result, its future role in Soviet politics isuncertain at a time when the long-dominant Communist Partyalso is being torn apart by factional fighting.&quot;If themovement's potential to partly destroy the Communist Partywas in doubt, its first achievements in splitting thedemocratic opposition are evident,&quot; the reform-mindedIndependent Newspaper wrote yesterday.   Announced late Monday and heralded as the force that will&quot;save democracy,&quot; the Movement for Democratic Reforms is justthe latest of several attempts to create a centrist bloc toinclude moderate Communists and non-communist democrats. Aswell as Mr. Shevardnadze, the former foreign minister, andMr. Yakovlev, a close aide to President Mikhail Gorbachev, itis being supported by the reformist mayors of Moscow andLeningrad and some other non-communist politicians.   Just one day after its unveiling, the movement is drawingfire from some of the very groups it seeks to attract. Inpart, the criticism stems from personal rivalries andjockeying for influence among various political parties. Butalso at issue is the question of whether the democraticopposition should seek to attract reform-minded communists orgo all-out in opposing the Communist Party.   The new movement's founders say that it should be open toall comers. They hope that it will provide a new pillar ofsupport for Mr. Gorbachev, who is under fire from hardlinersin the Communist Party.   But many democrats don't want anything to do withCommunists. Such differences already have affected the birthof the new movement. Some of its founders hope that it willturn into a full-fledged political party after a foundingCongress is held, probably in September.   But its detractors argue that a broad democratic movementalready exists in the Soviet Union, and there is no need foranother one. And the idea that Mr. Gorbachev could some dayswitch allegiance from the Communist Party to the newgrouping is anathema to many who deeply distrust the Sovietpresident.   Moreover, the new grouping may already have set its sightstoo high. Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of Leningrad, saidyesterday that he hopes it will include not just Russiandemocrats, but political activists from many of the nation's15 republics, including the breakaway Baltic states. But theinitial reaction from such groups outside Russia has rangedfrom lukewarm to complete disinterest.   This disarray has a familiar look. An attempt to create asimilar centrist grouping after last year's Communist Partycongress collapsed within months.   Nonetheless, the inclusion of such heavyweights as Messrs.Shevardnadze and Yakovlev in the new group has raised hopesthat, this time, the efforts will prove more successful.   &quot;We must move up to the nationwide political arena,&quot; saysOleg Rumiantsev, one party leader who favors joining the newmovement. Mr. Rumiantsev, who co-chairs the Russian SocialDemocratic Party, says: &quot;If we reject this initiative, weourselves are giving up the political arena to the CommunistParty.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev himself has given a mixed welcome to the newgrouping. His spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, noted yesterdaythat its goals seem in line with those of the Sovietpresident, and should be welcomed as such.   Yet an aide to Mr. Shevardnadze, Teimuraz Stepanov, saysthat the former foreign minister and Mr. Yakovlev had beentalking to Mr. Gorbachev about the new movement for months.&quot;Gorbachev is against this -- he wanted us to wait,&quot; he says.   Many reformers are deeply skeptical. Nikolai Travkin, headof the anti-Communist Russian Democratic Party, wanted toform a party of his own with Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.Yakovlev. But he backed off when they insisted on calling ita movement. &quot;You need a party, not a movement, but they wantto stay Communists and be democrats at the same time,&quot; saidMr. Travkin's aide, Sergei Vidensky. &quot;You have to choose, butthey don't want to leave the party.&quot;   According to one insider, democratic parties alreadyunited in another movement, called Democratic Russia, plan toform a superparty of their own. &quot;We will try to be anindependent political movement,&quot; said historian and lawmakerYuri Afanasiev, a leading activist in Democratic Russia. &quot;Letothers support Gorbachev.&quot;   Mr. Afanasiev and others are unwilling to forgive Mr.Gorbachev for his shift last fall to more authoritarian rule.They are still smarting from his attacks on the progressiveintelligentsia, and for what they see as his betrayal of anattempt last fall to create a market economy in the SovietUnion.   Other problems hampering the unity of opposition groupsinclude differing views over the relation between Moscow andthe republics. The Movement for Democratic Reforms backs theso-called 9 plus 1 treaty signed by Mr. Gorbachev and theleaders of nine Soviet republics last April. It would leavesubstantial power with the central government in Moscow. Butother democratic groups favor a looser confederation ofsovereign states.   The result of all these disagreements is that whatinitially looked like a natural alliance to challenge theCommunist Party now appears hopelessly entangled in internalrifts and rivalries. Should the Communist Party split, itcould face competition from two outside groups, one the newMovement for Democratic Reform, and the other a party thattries to unite disparate non-Communist factions. Theprognosis is more political paralysis, which the country canill afford.</TEXT></DOC>
