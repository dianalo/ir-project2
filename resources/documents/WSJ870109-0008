Grum, president and chief executive officer.    The company earned $21.7 million, or 89 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales for the fourth quarter are expected to have increased about 23%, to about $360 million from $292 million, he said.    A drop in net of 4.7% to 7%, to about $79 million to $81 million, is expected for the year, Mr. Grum said. Sales for the year, however, should have risen to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion. Temple-Inland, a maker of packaging board, containers and building materials, also expects to report that 1986 per-share net slipped slightly to $3.25 to $3.30, from $3.50.    Despite the second consecutive decline in yearly earnings, Mr. Grum said almost every segment of the company showed improvement overall in the year and the quarter compared with the year-earlier periods. He said the trend should continue through 1987, with the exception of the building materials division, which he expects will be hurt by the new tax code.    Both the 1985 fourth-quarter and yearly results include a gain of $7.1 million from the sale of the Eastex Packaging Inc. unit to a Manville Corp. unit for $26 million. </TEXT></DOC>
