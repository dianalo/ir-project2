Jimmy Swaggart's confession of sexual misconduct.   ``My feeling is that there will be more damage, and thecredibility of those of us in Christian broadcasting will be hurt alittle bit more,'' Jerry Rose, president of National ReligiousBroadcasters, said Monday.   ``This is not what we are about, and we have spent an inordinateamount of time dealing with these issues,'' said Rose, who operatesreligious station WCFC-TV in Chicago.   Swaggart, among the nation's most widely watched televisionpreachers, stepped down from his pulpit Sunday after confessing hehad sinned against God and his family.   Officials with his church, the Assemblies of God, said he hadadmitted to a long history of sexual problems and would beprohibited from preaching for a minimum of three months while heundergoes rehabilitation.   Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for the Rev. Jerry Falwell, judged thedamage to television ministries to be survivable.   ``I look at the example of a Gary Hart moral failure _ that didnot ruin the Democratic party or other Democratic candidates, butit did ruin Gary Hart,'' DeMoss said.   It didn't work that way a year ago. Some of the big ministries,including Swaggart's, bled from the wounds inflicted by JimBakker's adultery and high living in the PTL ministry, and OralRoberts' do-or-die appeal for $8 million.   In the aftermath, no one sounded more cynical and disillusionedthan Swaggart. ``You can stay more holy a lot of times watching`Miami Vice' than watching so-called Christian television,'' hesaid in one of his rousing sermons a year ago.   ``A lot of people saw Jimmy as a pacesetter for doing whatneeded to be done in the church, so in this case it is shocking,''Rose said.   The Rev. James Robison, a TV evangelist who is seen on about 150stations around the country, said the fear of criticism fromSwaggart and other preachers may have led Bakker to hide his ownproblem, rather than address it.   ``Jim Bakker told me himself, he said, `I wanted help, but I wasso afraid of what would be said,''' Robison said early today onABC's ``Nightline.''   At CBN, whose operations include the Christian BroadcastingNetwork and CBN University, spokesman Benton Miller declined tospeculate on the impact from Swaggart's problems.   Last year, however, he said contributions to CBN dropped 32.5percent from April to October, and have remained flat. When CBN cutnearly 500 employees last summer, founder Pat Robertson blamed thecontroversies surrounding Bakker and Roberts.   Roberts, based in Tulsa, Okla., had said that God might ``callme home'' if he didn't raise $8 million by the end of March, themonth of Bakker's confession and resignation from PTL. CBN's fiscalyear started April 1.   ``We had to take the whole hit of that, plus the change in thetalent mix for the 700 Club, plus the drop in oil prices ... plusthe recent October stock market plunge,'' Miller said Monday. ``Allfour of those factors hit us all at once.''   The change in the talent mix involved Robertson's departure fromthe broadcast to seek the Republican presidential nomination, andthe resignation of co-host Ben Kinchlow. CBN cut 145 more employeesin November, leaving a workforce of 1,174, though it has alsomanaged to expand its television programming and launch a radioservice, Miller said.   DeMoss said contributions to Falwell's ministry had rebounded,but on Monday, WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh announced it was droppingFalwell's program because he was $50,000 in arrears.   Oma Bradner, who handles Falwell's television accounts, saidlate Monday a check was mailed on Friday.   Swaggart had a larger audience _ 1,720,000 households per weeklast November _ than any other video evangelist, according to theArbitron rating service. The A.C. Nielsen Co. put Swaggart'saudience at 860,000 households, second to Robert Schuller'saudience of 1,189,000 for the ``Hour of Power,'' but Nielsen saidSwaggart was seen on the most stations, 286.   Arbitron reported that Swaggart's audience had been 2,161,000households last February, before the PTL and Roberts controversies.Between February and November, Arbitron said, Schuller's audiencedropped from 1.7 million households to 1.4 million, Roberts' from1.15 million to 900,000, and Falwell's ``Old Time Gospel Hour''from 616,000 to 495,000.   Those figures are for broadcast audience only; most programsreach additional viewers on cable television.   Rose said Swaggart's weekly broadcast would remain on hisstation at least until he sees what Assemblies of God leadersdecide to do.</TEXT></DOC>
