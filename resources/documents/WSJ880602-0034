The moves will keep the pressure on in the fiercely competitive personal-computer end of the industry, though they aren't overly aggressive. IBM has called a news conference for this morning to announce some products, but an IBM spokesman said he couldn't comment on speculation about what the announcements would concern.    The industry executives said the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant will introduce three versions of what it will call the Personal System/2 Model 70, a high-end machine that will use the Intel Corp. 80386 central processor. The versions resemble the Model 80, currently the high end of the IBM line, except that they will sit on the desktop rather than on the floor in what is known as a tower configuration.    In addition, one of the machines will have an 80386 chip that runs 25% faster than the fastest available from any major competitor. That advantage will be short-lived, however: Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. is expected to announce a machine with the same chip by the end of the month, and others will soon follow.    IBM also will introduce a version of its low-end Model 25 that will be able to hook into a local network without the use of additional hardware, the executives said. That will better position the Model 25 for use in businesses; it had been introduced primarily as a machine for students or for those needing machines at home.    In addition, IBM will introduce a version of its Model 50 that will have a faster hard disk. The Model 50, in the middle of IBM's line, had drawn considerable criticism in the trade press for the slowness with which it retrieved information from the hard disk.    The executives also said IBM will cut prices on some existing models to make room for the new ones, though they weren't sure just how large the cuts would be or which models they would cover. Tim Bajarin, a consultant with Creative Strategies Research International, Santa Clara, Calif., speculated that they would cover at least the Models 25 and 30, at the low end of the line, and the Model 60, in the middle of the line. He said the cuts should range from 10% to 20%.    The industry executives said the three Model 70s will carry retail list prices of roughly $6,000, $8,000 and $10,000, in line with prices of versions of the Model 80. The actual sales prices figure to be lower because there is so much discounting being done by dealers currently. The executives weren't sure what the prices would be for the new Model 50 or the Model 25.    Despite the new products and the price cuts, IBM isn't being quite as aggressive as many in the industry had expected based on comments IBM executives made early in the year. Much of the reason stems from the hubbub that always develops any time IBM states a position, and from the rumors that grow ever-more outlandish as an IBM announcement date approaches. At the same time, IBM seems to have postponed the announcement of some products it was planning to bring out today.    In particular, IBM had been widely expected to bring out laptops using the muscular 80386 chip and the less powerful 80286, which is used in the middle of IBM's PS/2 line. IBM had also talked internally about bringing out versions of the Models 25 and 30 that would use the 80286, a much more powerful chip than the one they now use.    Michele Preston, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said she recommended personal-computer stocks aggressively yesterday because she thinks there has been a lot of misperception about what IBM will be able to do to its major personal-computer competitors. She said she thinks IBM will gain market share, but at the expense of what she called the second-tier companies, not Compaq, Apple Computer Inc., Tandy Corp. or probably even Wyse Technology.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, IBM's stock closed at $113.125, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
