<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0276 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new class of Total Variation Decreasing (TVD) schemes for 2-dimensionalscalar conservation laws is constructed using either flux-limited orslope-limited numerical fluxes. The schemes are proven to have formalsecond-order accuracy in regions where neither u/sub x/ nor y/sub y/vanishes. A new class of high-resolution large-time-step TVD schemesis constructed by adding flux-limited correction terms to the first-orderaccurate large-time-step version of the Engquist-Osher scheme. The useof the transport-collapse operator in place of the exact solution operatorfor the construction of difference schemes is studied. The productionof spurious extrema by difference schemes is studied. A simple conditionguaranteeing the nonproduction of spurious extrema is derived. A sufficientclass of entropy inequalities for a conservation law with a flux havinga single inflection point is presented. Finite-difference schemes satisfyinga discrete version of each entropy inequality are only first-order accurate.</TEXT></DOC>
