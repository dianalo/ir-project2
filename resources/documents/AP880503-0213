Albert Gore Jr. as his running mate if he wins the Democraticpresidential nomination.   Even more, about 40 percent in each state, said they favoredsomeone other than Gore or Jesse Jackson as the vice presidentialcandidate, and only a small share favored Jackson for the No. 2spot, ABC News exit polls said.   As he did in Pennsylvania last week, Dukakis won all groupsexcept blacks in both states. But while the Massachusetts governorcommanded strong support in Indiana, in Ohio more of his backershad reservations.   Moreover, voters expressed some unfamiliarity with Dukakis. Aplurality of Democrats in Ohio and a majority in Indiana said hisideology was ``just about right'' as opposed to too liberal and tooconservative, but another 34 percent in Ohio and 28 percent inIndiana said they didn't know.   ``Dukakis is still somewhat of an unknown ideologically,'' saidDoug Muzzio, a poll analyst for ABC News. ``A lot of people stilldon't have a handle on him, this late in the primary season.''   Muzzio said 33 percent of the voters in Ohio and 41 percent inIndiana said Jackson was too liberal.   Dukakis encountered mixed results in his new effort to drawblack votes from Jackson. In Indiana, a CBS News-New York Timespoll said Dukakis got about 12 percent of the black vote. The ABCpoll put it at 8 percent.   In Ohio, the CBS-Times poll said Dukakis got just 4 percent ofthe black vote, a share that was more in line with the earliercontests, in which black support for Jackson has been nearlyunanimous.   ``In Indiana and Ohio he tried to pick up more black support,and he's doing better in Indiana _ but only a little better,'' saidCBS poll analyst Brian Becker. Among other groups, he said,``Dukakis is winning across the board.''   While Dukakis won few black votes, Jackson won limited whitesupport _ 15 percent in Ohio and about 10 percent in Indiana, theCBS-Times poll said.   In Indiana, 51 percent of Dukakis' voters said they backed himstrongly, to 39 percent who had some reservations. In Ohio,however, 45 percent of the Dukakis voters said they had somereservations about him, and 41 percent were strong.   Large shares of Dukakis voters in both states viewed Jacksonunfavorably, and only 60 percent of Dukakis' own supporters saidthey would back him with Jackson on the ticket, the CBS-Times pollssaid. Similarly, 60 percent of Dukakis voters said Jackson shouldnot be offered the vice presidential slot.   The ABC polls said only about 15 percent of Dukakis voters inOhio and Indiana favored Jackson over Gore or someone else for thevice presidential nomination. Just over 30 percent favored Gore andabout 40 percent said someone else.   Sixty-five percent of the Dukakis voters in Indiana and 59percent in Ohio had an unfavorable view of Jackson, the CBS-Timespoll said.   As has been the case in other states, Dukakis fared better withJackson voters that Jackson did with Dukakis voters. In Indiana theCBS-Times poll said 54 percent of Jackson voters had a favorableview of Dukakis, to 38 percent unfavorable. In Ohio the split was48 favorable, 41 unfavorable.   The ABC poll found that about 60 percent of Jackson's voters inboth states said they would vote for Dukakis if he were the nomineeagainst Bush, and just about 6 percent said they would back Bush.   While about a third said they would not vote, ``based onprevious history that will split disproportionately for Dukakis,''said Muzzio said. ``Blacks aren't voting for Dukakis now, but givena choice of Dukakis in the future will vote for himoverwhelmingly.''   The margin of sampling error for the polls was 3 percentagepoints.</TEXT></DOC>
