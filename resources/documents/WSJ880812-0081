The 106-member platform panel is expected to put the finishing touches on the platform today, getting it ready for approval by the Republican National Convention here next week. After a week of deliberations, the committee was making few changes in a staff draft that had the solid imprint of the party's conservative wing but that, unlike the party's 1984 version, also reflects Vice President George Bush's efforts to make some limited gestures to the party's moderates.    The 30,000-word document amply meets Mr. Bush's goal of providing a specific blueprint on which to base his fall presidential campaign. It is far more detailed, and more than seven times longer, than the thematic and purposefully vague document the Democrats produced last month at their convention in Atlanta.    But Mr. Bush is likely to run into some of the problems the Democrats sought to avoid when they steered clear of specific policy statements. By including a paragraph from almost every GOP constituency group -- and some language for groups that the party hopes will come under its umbrella -- the Republicans are vulnerable to charges that they are pandering, an accusation that they usually lob at the Democrats.    In addition, the Republican platform promises so much to so many -- restoration of tax breaks for independent oil and gas drillers, deployment of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; anti-missile defense as soon as possible, a refundable tax credit for child care, a drastic cut in estate taxes -- that the promises don't square with other elements of the platform that pledge a lean government and a balanced budget.    And while the GOP criticizes the Democrats for their vagueness, the Republican platform's chief budget-balancing instrument -- Mr. Bush's &quot;flexible freeze&quot; -- is no less vague. Mr. Bush has refused to say where he would make cuts under the plan. And given his adamant opposition to a tax increase and advocacy of big military budgets, many experts say he will have to reduce such politically sensitive social programs as Medicare if he is to meet his fiscal goals.    Throughout the week of debates, the platform committee labored under the guiding hand of Bush operatives who succeeded in crafting a conservative, though not extreme, position paper. The Bush forces defeated efforts to weaken language on such emotional issues as opposition to abortion and avoided harsh language on AIDS.    For the third consecutive time, the GOP platform won't call for the passage of an Equal Rights Amendment. Although the party noted its &quot;historic commitment to equal rights for women,&quot; it came out against the concept of &quot;comparable worth&quot; where jobs traditionally held by women are deemed to have the same value as others traditionally held by men.    But the party makes specific overtures to a number of groups ranging from &quot;Americans with disabilities&quot; and Native Americans to Hawaiians and residents of Guam.    The document avoids mentioning Mr. Dukakis by name but is peppered with references to what it disparages as the &quot;Democrat Party&quot; or &quot;liberal Democrats.&quot;    The platform ascribes a wide array of governmental, fiscal and social ills to the Democrats. These include a massive federal government, poor schools, the farm crisis, the high cost of health care and even homelessness. &quot;Homelessness demonstrates the failure of liberalism,&quot; the platform says.    The Republicans use the platform to buttress their &quot;pro-family&quot; image and to seek to prevent their rivals from usurping the issue. &quot;We seek to strengthen the family,&quot; the platform says. &quot;Democrats try to supplant it. In the 1960s and 1970s the family bore the brunt of liberal attacks on everything the American people cherished. Our whole society paid dearly.&quot;    The platform bids voters to &quot;remember the Carter-Mondale years,&quot; adding: &quot;The Democrats would drag us back to those dreadful years when inflation was robbing workers of their earnings, consumers of their spending power and families of their savings.&quot;    In an effort to blunt Democratic charges that the Reagan-Bush years have been rife with Republican corruption, the platform takes aim at the Democratic-controlled Congress, particularly the House ethics committee. The committee, according to the platform, &quot;has become a shield for Democrats who get caught but don't get punished.&quot;    The document also seeks to portray the Democrats as doomsayers, even as the economy burgeons. &quot;The ideological heirs of Carter and Mondale are trying again to sell the public a false bill of goods,&quot; the platform says. &quot;These liberals call America's prosperity an illusion. They fantasize our economy is declining. They claim our future is in the hands of other nations. They aren't operating in the real world.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
