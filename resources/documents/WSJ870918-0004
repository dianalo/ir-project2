The commission, Mr. Ruder said, needs more statutory authority over tender offers, largely because of the recent Supreme Court ruling on Indiana's takeover law. The ruling upheld for the first time state regulation of corporate takeovers.    The rush by the states to adopt similar or more restrictive legislation &quot;threatens to create a maze of overlapping and conflicting regulation,&quot; the former Northwestern University law professor testified yesterday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's securities panel.    State attempts to shield their corporations from hostile bids have &quot;presented serious impediments to the free and efficient operation&quot; of the stock markets, Mr. Ruder said. &quot;Drawing the line between appropriate state regulation of internal corporate affairs and improper state regulation of national tender offers is not easy,&quot; he added, &quot;but the task is unavoidable.&quot;    While the SEC can use its rule-making power to develop that federal-state boundary in appropriate cases, Mr. Ruder said, Congress must ensure that the commission has sufficient authority to cover the field of tender offers.    A House takeover bill, co-sponsored by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D, Mich.) and the securities panel chairman, Edward Markey (D., Mass.), would, among other things, significantly strengthen the hand of SEC rule makers.    The North American Securities Administrators Association, a group of state regulators, contends the bill goes too far. In testimony yesterday, Tennessee Securities Commissioner James Meyer, president of the association, criticized as &quot;overly broad and unnecessary&quot; provisions in the bill that would empower the SEC to regulate &quot;any defensive tactic&quot; by target companies. He warned that the bill could lead to &quot;unwarranted encroachment&quot; on state corporation law.    Mr. Meyer also faulted the bill for failing to reaffirm what he called the &quot;historical state role&quot; in tender-offer regulation. He urged lawmakers to add language that validates the state regulatory role in the area of corporate governance, including shareholder voting rights.    In the past two years, the SEC under Mr. Ruder's predecessor, John Shad, didn't engage in much takeover rule making and didn't call for major legislative changes. Indeed, the commission decided in January 1986 against recommending curbs on several defensive tactics embraced by companies fearful of being raided. Mr. Ruder succeeded Mr. Shad in August.    At yesterday's hearing, Mr. Ruder said the SEC still pursues a policy of neutrality between bidders and target companies, and he assured state regulators that the commission doesn't favor extending federal regulation over such corporate-governance matters as &quot;golden parachutes,&quot; which are lucrative severence packages for corporate management, and &quot;greenmail,&quot; in which outsiders buy a company's shares and gets the company to buy them back in order to avoid a takeover.    Mr. Ruder said that most of the &quot;troublesome&quot; takeover practices can be corrected by strengthening the reporting provisions of the Williams Act, which governs tender offers. He recommended requiring bidders to stop buying stock as soon as they acquire a stake of 5% or more in a company's stock, and to disclose their stake within five business days, rather than the current 10 days. They could resume buying stock as soon as they file a 13-D report with the SEC, he said. Such a standstill requirement would keep raiders from mounting sneak attacks during the so-called 10-day window.    He also asked lawmakers to clarify the definition of an investment &quot;group&quot; for reporting purposes, and to empower the SEC to impose stiff fines for reporting violations. </TEXT></DOC>
