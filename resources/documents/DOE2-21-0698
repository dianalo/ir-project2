<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0698 </DOCNO><TEXT>A combined fuel-cycle improvement facility is proposed for H-Area of SRP.The Fuel Production Facility (FPR) includes two processes: (1) OnsiteUranium Recycle (OSUR) will convert uranyl nitrate from the HM separationsprocess in to U{sub 3}O{sub 8} fuel. Nitrate shipments to Oak Ridge willcease. The OSUR process also has lower operating costs than the Oak Ridgeprocess it will replace. (2) Powder Metallurgy (PM) will produce fuelbillet cores by compacting a mixture of U{sub 3}O{sub 8} and aluminumpowders. This process will replace the 321-M casting/machining processfor metal alloy fuel. PM fuel requires less aluminum, increases reactorproduction, and has lower operating costs. Together, these processesgive savings and increased production worth $12--22 million a year, dependingupon reactor schedules. Up to $38 million in one-time restoration costsmay be avoided at the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant. 19 refs., 6 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
