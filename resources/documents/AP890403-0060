(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tobacco plants may be enlisted in the waron cancer by a spray that turns them into factories for makinganti-cancer drugs, sunscreen and other useful chemicals, anexecutive said Monday.   ``It's a way to use tobacco for products other than cigarettesfor smoking,'' said geneticist Robert L. Erwin, president ofBiosource Genetics Corp., a privately held company backed byventure capitalists.   ``This technology might be a way to reduce the cost of producingmany medically important chemicals.''   Erwin said the Vacaville, Calif., company has applied forpatents on a method of genetically engineering tobacco plants sothey can produce various desired products. Biosource Genetics alsowants to patent the process to help make melanin, a natural skinpigment that might be used as a more effective sunscreen to preventskin cancer from ultraviolet sunlight.   Experiments so far have been performed indoors, where tobaccoplants and cells successfully produced two enzymes to test themethod, as well as an enzyme that helps make melanin, Erwin saidduring the American Cancer Society's annual seminar for sciencewriters.   Within 12 months, the privately held company hopes to conductfield tests of tobacco genetically engineered to produce theanti-cancer drug interleukin-2 and serum albumin, a major proteinin blood that is used as a supplement in transfusions.   Erwin said other potential products of genetically alteredtobacco include an insecticide, a substance that allows thetime-release of flavors in foods and fragrances in perfumes,enzymes to help make paper and reduce cholesterol levels in foods,and other cancer drugs such as interferon and vincristine.   Biosource Genetics used tobacco plants because they arewell-understood, easily manipulated and serve as plant researchers'equivalent of the laboratory mouse, Erwin said. The company wasconsidering the same method to genetically alter pepper, potato,and tomato plants, he added.   The effort to convert tobacco plants into living factories forthe cheap mass production of industrial chemicals, medicines andcosmetics drew criticism from an environmental group. But it alsogarnered interest from a tobacco growers group and cautious praisefrom the former director of the National Cancer Institute.   Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., who left NCI last year to becomephysician-in-chief at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering CancerCenter, said he thought the possibility of using tobacco to fightcancer instead of causing it ``is really kind of cute.''   ``It's a very interesting idea,'' DeVita said. ``It sounds toogood to be true, but looks real enough to pursue.''   Andrew Kimbrell, attorney and policy director for theanti-biotechnology Foundation on Economic Trends, said a substancesprayed on tobacco plants to profoundly change what they produce``could go to other plants with results unknown. We have realconcerns about what other plants it might affect.''   Erwin said his company's method is safe because the spraydegrades quickly, creates only a temporary genetic change in thetobacco plants, and the changes are not passed from plant to plantor from one generation of plants to the next.   The process ``should help make the cigarette habit increasinglyexpensive as tobacco production is shunted into more constructiveend uses,'' he said.   Reginald Lester, managing director of the Tobacco Growers'Information Committee in Raleigh, N.C., said, ``Certainly growerswould be interested in taking a look at this if it could be shownto be commercially viable.''   Biosource Genetics alters tobacco plants by spraying them withmolecules of RNA _ part of the fundamental hereditary informationof all living things _ taken from the tobacco mosaic virus andencased in a protein coating.   This virus-like substance invades the plant, carrying with it agene, or hereditary command, that orders production of the desiredchemical.   Because the new genetic command dies with the plant, a farmerwould plant tobacco, then decide later in the season whether tosell it for cigarettes or spray it to produce a medicine orindustrial chemical. Erwin said a different spray could be used thenext season to make the tobacco produce another substance.</TEXT></DOC>
