He's a police detective who has won the respect of hiscolleagues by taking big risks as a hostage negotiator. Whena black politician insults him with ethnic name-calling, Goldmerely blanches while his Irish partner angrily rises to hisdefense. Though Gold seems tired -- he isn't young -- he isstill caught up in the charge of his work. But then, it seemsthat's all he has.   Mr. Mamet introduces Gold (Joe Mantegna) as he and hispartner are assigned to an inner-city drug case that the FBIhas botched. These middle-aged men grab the challenge -- toprove that they are better and to pretend that they are asgood as they ever were.</LP><TEXT>   At first it's maddening to listen to the self-consciousstaccato beat of some of Mr. Mamet's dialogue, with itspointed repetitions (&quot;Sir, we, my partner . . . we have thisguy. We, my partner and I . . .&quot;). On stage, the artificemakes for a kind of poetry. In the closeup realism of film,it seems stilted.   But soon the strategy behind the deliberate fakeness ofMr. Mamet's stylized language starts to work even on film.You can see the detectives don't really buy their own machoputdowns of the FBI but need to pretend they do in order torev themselves up. They don't entirely believe the words theyare saying and so they repeat them, as though they're makingsure the words really got said.   On the way to the big bust, Gold gets sidetracked by ahumdrum murder; the victim is an old Jewish woman running apawn shop in the ghetto. Gold stops for a minute, to help thepatrol-car officers on the case, and before he can beg off,he's assigned to the case.   As one would expect from Mr. Mamet, &quot;Homicide&quot; isn'treally about the solving of a murder. The old woman's deathsidetracks the detective into a twisted set of events thatlead him to question his sense of identity. While Mr. Mamet'stwo previous films, &quot;House of Games&quot; and &quot;Things Change,&quot; andmany of his plays, are about con artists, this film is aboutself-delusion. Bobby Gold has been conning himself for solong that when he starts seeking the truth, he'll believealmost anything.   Though Mr. Mamet says he's been influenced by &quot;good,old-fashioned American movie-making,&quot; he seems moreinfluenced by modern American theater, mainly his own.&quot;Homicide&quot; moves in the rhythm of Mr. Mamet's language. It'svery formal yet very colloquial, and deeply cynical.   Mr. Mamet sends Bobby Gold on an elaborate search for hisJewish soul. But the playwright turns that favorite subjectfor Saturday-morning sermons -- what is a Jew? -- into acleverly plotted quest, full of compelling, misleadingsignposts. Gold gets drawn into an exotic world ofYiddishspeaking terrorists and articulates his new passionwith such exuberance he could be a spokesman for theFederation of Jewish Philanthropies. His bombast is a guiltyresponse to the question he's asked more than once by aJewish character: Why has he abandoned his people? &quot;Do youhate yourself that much?&quot; asks the murdered woman's prettygranddaughter. &quot;Do you belong nowhere?&quot; These barbs areaccompanied by not-so-oblique references to the Holocaust andmournful cello music.   Mr. Mantegna, who has become the primary speaker of Mr.Mamet's lines on stage and on screen, plays Bobby Gold as noone else possibly could. He's a captivating guide through Mr.Mamet's dark, unsettling passages.   ---   Gus Van Sant is working hard to be the Beat poet ofindependent American film. His second and best known movie,&quot;Drugstore Cowboy,&quot; is a dreamy, drifting vision of a drugaddict's life, punctuated by hallucinatory visions(itty-bitty animals floating through clouds, for example).   In his latest work, &quot;My Own Private Idaho,&quot; Mr. Van Santfollows a couple of young male hustlers in Seattle andPortland, Ore., on their voyage through Shakespeare,narcolepsy and a visual homage to America the Beautiful.   The versatile River Phoenix, here appearing as a sweetzombie named Mike, is the narcoleptic. He lives a sordidlife, sleeping on streets when he isn't having sex (with menand women) for money. When something starts to remind him ofthe past he's drifted from, he falls into a deep sleep. Whenhe sleeps, he dreams, of his mother and his childhood home,which Mr. Van Sant's cinematographers, Eric Alan Edwards andJohn Campbell, have filmed to look like a deviant Grant Woodlandscape.   The Shakespearian elements have been assigned to KeanuReeves. He plays a mayor's son who has chosen to wait for hisfather's death among the lowlifes. Mr. Van Sant makes thereference to Prince Hal directly; one scene is a fracturedversion of &quot;Henry IV.&quot;   This is all very strange and a little tedious. Yet thereis something arresting and oddly poignant in Mr. Van Sant'splayful vision of the road to nowhere.   ---   VIDEO TIP: A colleague said that reading about thewonderful new movie &quot;Rambling Rose&quot; reminded him of one ofhis favorite films of all time, which also was written byCalder Willingham. &quot;One-Eyed Jacks,&quot; the picture, whichMarlon Brando took over from director Stanley Kubrick,contains many great lines, but the one my colleague likesbest goes something like this: &quot;You're a one-eyed jack, dad,but I've seen the other side of your face.&quot;   The screen credits of Mr. Willingham, also a prolificnovelist, include many other memorable films: &quot;The Graduate,&quot;&quot;Little Big Man,&quot; &quot;The Vikings,&quot; &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; and&quot;Thieves Like Us.&quot; When you take a look at these pictures,give credit where it's due.</TEXT></DOC>
