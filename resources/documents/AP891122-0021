Former escrow agent Marilyn Louise Harrell was indicted by afederal grand jury Tuesday on fraud and embezzling charges in oneof the most prominent cases stemming from the HUD scandal.   Testifying before congressional committees investigatingmismanagement and political favoritism at the agency during theReagan administration, Harrell admitted taking money she wassupposed to hold in escrow for the government.   Federal authorities said Tuesday she spent most of the money onherself, her family and her friends, buying 40 cars, making housepayments and purchasing a $2,500 TV console and other items.   ``The single largest charity by far was herself,'' saidBreckinridge L. Willcox, U.S. attorney for Maryland.   ``She gives charity a bad name,'' HUD Secretary Jack Kemp toldreporters.   Harrell, 46, was charged with embezzling $5.6 million from HUD,making false statements to the federal government and making falsestatements in connection with a loan application. If convicted, shecould be fined up to $1 million, sentenced to up to 22 years inprison and ordered to make restitution.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the case appeared to bethe largest single theft of government funds charged against anindividual.   ``Oh, Lordy, Lordy,'' Harrell said when informed of theindictment. She said her attorney advised her to plead innocent.   ``Most of what I gave to my family was my own money, money thatI had legitimately earned,'' said Harrell, who is now unemployedand working on a book about herself. ``I don't understand why theywant to make it sound like I am such a terrible person.''   Harrell is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keepingmore than $10 million from the sale of homes whose owners defaultedon government-insured mortgagages. She is the second of the agentsto be charged.   Two weeks after she testified in Congress, HUD seized her housein Washington's Maryland suburbs as well as several otherproperties she said she purchased with HUD money to help charitiesand homeless families.   According to Willcox, about $625,000 of the embezzled funds havebeen recovered from Harrell. ``I'm not sure there's a whole lotleft,'' he said.   Willcox said Harrell has cooperated with investigators.   By her own accounting last June, Harrell spent $1.35 million tobuy and rehabilitate 16 homes for needy families, $810,000 onsalaries for ex-criminals employed by her construction company,$450,000 in donations to seven charities, $368,000 on payments andinsurance for 40 cars given to individuals and charities, and$300,000 for a shelter being built by Maryland Suburban Rescue.   Charlotte Chepaitis, who worked with Harrell to take care ofpoor people in Baltimore, denied prosecutors' statements thatHarrell was merely helping herself.   ``They don't know what they're talking about when they say Mrs.Harrell never did anything to help the poor,'' she said. But sheadded that Harrell did not require an accounting of her money.   ``We didn't keep any books,'' Chepaitis said. ``The books waskept only by God. He carried the pencil and paper, and Jesus said,`Do your alms in secret and the Father in heaven will reward you.'''   Several members of Congress have accused the Justice Departmentof failing to aggressively prosecute HUD-related crimes.   The department's statement announcing the indictment indirectlyresponded to such criticism, noting that the government hadobtained 140 HUD-related convictions nationwide in fiscal 1989 andnearly 600 in the last four years.   Most of those cases have involved individuals charged withdefrauding HUD loan programs. Congressional critics have saidThornburgh shows little zeal for investigating former top agencyofficials and prominent Republicans who participated in HUDprograms found to have been tainted by political influence.   Thornburgh has rejected the criticism as partisan sniping.</TEXT></DOC>
