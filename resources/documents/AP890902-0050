On Thursday, government sources in Bonn, West Germany, saidHungarian and West German officials had devised a plan to allow upto 20,000 East Germans to flee to the West in the next few days.   Officials said Friday that Hungary's Red Cross, alreadyaccommodating an estimated 3,000 East Germans in Budapest, opened anew ``tent city'' for 3,000 more at Zanka near Lake Balaton.   Many of the estimated 200,000 East Germans vacationing in Hungaryare camping around the lake.   The main Budapest camp, Csilleberc, was so crowded that newarrivals were being bused to Zanka, said Arpad Alfoeldi, deputy headof Hungary's Red Cross.   However, he denied a report on the German-language radio stationDanubius that the move was tantamount to evacuation prior toshipping the East Germans to the West.   East Germans, some on their way home from Black Sea vacationspots in Bulgaria and Romania, flocked to the three Red Cross campsin Budapest after word was leaked of plans for the mass exodus.   Karsten Voigt, foreign affairs expert for West Germany'sopposition Social Democrats, said Hungarian Communist Partypresident Rezso Nyers assured him that all East Germans who want toleave Hungary for West Germany will be able to do so.   Hungary's prime minister, Miklos Nemeth, and West Germanofficials have estimated that up to 20,000 East Germans in Hungarywant to go to West Germany, where they receive automatic citizenshipand assistance in starting a new life.   More than 5,000 East Germans already have used Hungary to escapeto Austria and then to West Germany since Budapest starteddismantling fortifications along its western border in May.   Between 30 and 40 East Germans each day travel illegally fromCzechoslavakia _ the only country they can visit without permissionfrom their government _ to Hungary, the Hungarian daily Mai Nap said.   Police in West Berlin said Friday that East German border guardshad fired shots in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent an East Germanman from fleeing. They said the 24-year-old man, who was notidentified, managed to scale border fortifications and arrivedunharmed.   Also Friday, security officials in Munich said they expected EastGermany to use any mass exodus of East German refugees to slipintelligence agents into West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
