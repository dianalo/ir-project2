<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0651 </DOCNO><TEXT>Semiconductor laser sources for optical communication links between geostationaryand low Earth orbiting satellites were investigated. Phase locked arraysof coupled stripes or related devices offer single mode operation atmuch lower optical and current density than other techniques. The highestpowers are expected using GaAlAs, the best reliability using InGaAsP.Use of very thin highly doped p-InP buffer layers in planar growth, widemesas, long cavities, and facet coating for DCPBH lasers are suggested.Continuous output power values up to 340 mW can be generated by unoptimizedmultimode InGaAsP lasers emitting at 1.3 microns. It should be possibleto generate continuous power levels greater than 1000 mW by optimizingfacet reflectivity and thermal impedance. The Y-coupled array is themost promising concept. The addition of flared output guides, and thepositioning of the couplers close to the facet with the larger numberof emitters, should improve performance.</TEXT></DOC>
