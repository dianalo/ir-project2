At a mere total outlay of $40 million,Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh delivered unto the GeorgeMitchells, Lee Hamiltons and David Obeys of the world theheadline they wanted: &quot;North Guilty]&quot;                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   So began our May 5, 1989, editorial noting the juryverdict that acquitted Oliver North of the most seriouscharges but convicted him of three offenses, includingaccepting a security fence around his house. The editorialreferred to the politically partisan nature of the Northprosecution. Not content to let the public watch theIran-Contra hearings and make up its mind about the Reaganforeign policy, congressional Democrats wanted a prosecutionand jury verdict to impose an official sanction on theiropponents. It's a special irony that this politicaloverreaching has produced a debacle.   When a federal appeals court reversed the Northconvictions, the judges told Mr. Walsh he'd have to proveline by line and witness by witness that the trial wastotally uninfluenced by Mr. North's immunized testimony. Mr.Walsh's first witness, Robert McFarlane, last week said thatof course he was affected, that the world was awash inliterature and television about the issue. And so Mr. Walsh'soverdue recognition of reality yesterday finally clears Lt.Col. Oliver North (Marine, retired).   If any reason can be discerned for why it took Mr. Walshso long to drop this case, it is that he needed to wait untilhe had found another human target to justify his continuedexistence as prosecutor. He is now pursuing the CIA's ClairGeorge essentially for being a member of the Washingtonestablishment. Mr. George didn't tell Congress what it failedto ask and didn't want to know. We predict this case willalso collapse in court.   There is a broader point to be made here about the life ofWashington. Many public officials have now been through theIndependent-Counsel process (other abusive Walshprosecutions, familiar to readers of these pages, ground upfigures such as Spitz Channell, Richard Miller, Albert Hakim,Richard Secord and Joseph Fernandez). It is fair to likenthis Kafkaesque ritual to what used to happen to people inthe Soviet Union.   In both, defendants are condemned to a long prosecutorialgulag in which their lives become wholly a function ofdefending themselves against the state and all its powers. Athis confirmation hearings, Clarence Thomas spoke againstMorrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court case upholding theseIndependent Counsel, precisely because the court failed tonote the threat to individual liberties posed by unsupervisedprosecutors.   Once an individual stands accused by these prosecutors,the rest of Washington -- the executive branch, Congress, thepress -- either joins in the condemnation proceedings or istoo timid to speak up in defense. Congress bears a specialburden. Mr. Walsh knew about the fatal immunity issue, butwent ahead with the North trial anyway because his officeserves at the instigation and pleasure of Congress, andCongress obviously wanted a &quot;Guilty]&quot; headline draped overOliver North.   Yesterday President Bush said, &quot;It sounds like the systemworked very well.&quot; Part of the system, anyway. Of course,political enemies used to get out of the gulag eventually,too. They called it, appropriately, &quot;coming out of the ice.&quot;   Mr. Walsh has just overseen the most expensive prosecutionever in this country, probably 100 times the costs ofprosecuting a Manuel Noriega or a John Gotti. Mr. Walsh'sstaff has run up direct and indirect taxpayer expenses thatexceed $100 million.   The Independent Counsel has not fulfilled whatever highgoals its creators imagined for it. Freed of control of anysort, it has led inevitably to abusive politicalprosecutions. President Bush should now thank Mr. Walsh forhis efforts and send him home. He should then inform Congressthat he will veto any reauthorization of theIndependent-Counsel statute, which expires next year.</TEXT></DOC>
