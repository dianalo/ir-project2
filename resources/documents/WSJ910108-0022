Bank of New England's losses in the fourth quarter showthat the real estate market is still deteriorating, bankersand economists say, raising concerns that other banks in theregion may see even more loans going bad.</LP><TEXT>   While other large banks in the region have adequatecapital by federal regulatory standards, all have beenweakened by losses of late. As a result, the longer anddeeper the recession -- and particularly the real estatedownturn -- the greater the risk to the future of other majorbanks.   Indeed, many analysts are beginning to see unsettlingparallels to the early days of the banking crisis in Texas,where nine of the state's 10 largest banks failed between1980 and 1989. When the first large banks began to fail inTexas in the early 1980s, &quot;people said it will never happento stronger banks like Republic Bank or even Mercantile Bank-- but, eventually, they went down,&quot; says Keith Baker, ananalyst at Money CS Inc., a bank consulting firm in Texas.&quot;What you have to do in New England is look at who madeaggressive commercial real estate and construction loans,assume 25% or so will go bad, and then figure who willsurvive.&quot;   The fact is most New England banks were heavily involvedin commercial real estate and construction lending during theboom years between 1986 and 1989, with increases in those twoloan categories averaging over 200% at the region's fourlargest banks.   No major lender was more aggressive, or had a greaterconcentration of real estate loans in the region, than Bankof New England. On top of the $2.84 billion in bad assetsalready on its books, it was the estimated $775 millionincrease in bad assets in the fourth quarter -- a $275million writeoff of bad loans plus an addition of $500million to nonperforming loans -- that made the bankingcompany insolvent and forced the federal takeover of Bank ofNew England Sunday.   But others were lending generously, too, in the 1980s. Forexample, from 1986 to 1989 commercial real estate loansincreased 305% at Shawmut National Corp., according tofigures from First Albany Corp., a brokerage firm. As ofSept. 30, the bank had $2.5 billion in such loans, of which14% were nonperforming.   At Bank of Boston Corp., commercial real estate loansdoubled to nearly $3 billion in the same period. By Sept. 30,14% of such loans and 23% of the bank's construction loanshad soured, making up more than a third of the bank's $1.86billion in nonperforming assets. Such bad assets are largelyresponsible for the bank's $255 million third-quarter lossand for what bank officials say was a &quot;substantial losses&quot; inthe fourth quarter.   &quot;What's scary is that the growth in construction andcommercial real estate loans was the fastest at Bank of NewEngland, but not by much,&quot; says Don Kauth, an analyst atFirst Albany. &quot;The horse is out of the barn. The question nowis which of the banks will get those loans paid back.&quot;   Other major banks, however, contend that Bank of NewEngland loaned recklessly and that they are different. &quot;Thereare almost no banks that don't have significant exposure incommercial real estate, to say the least,&quot; says AnthonyZehnder, a spokesman for Shawmut. &quot;The difference will bewhich banks are well capitalized, because only they will beable to weather the storm. Our capital is strong.&quot;   Bank of Boston spokesman Robert McQwade said, &quot;I don't seethere being a domino effect here&quot; with Bank of New England'sfailure being followed by other major bank failures. Bank ofBoston is strongly capitalized, with $1.85 billion inshareholders' equity, he noted.   Still, questions remain about whether banks will have evenmore real estate loans go bad. Bank of New England'sfourth-quarter results indicate they might.   Kent Price, Bank of New England's chief financial officer,said the bank managed to keep its total of nonperformingloans rising only slightly through much of 1990 byrestructuring or refinancing bad loans almost as fast asother loans soured.   But the credit crunch reduced most options forrestructuring loans in the fourth quarter -- resulting inmore borrowers defaulting. Pessimists say that other banks'borrowers face similar problems.   Adding to the gloom is the fact that a huge volume ofdistressed real estate is hanging over the market, not justfrom Bank of New England, but from a dozen other small banksthat failed before it.   &quot;A lot depends on the length of the recession -- theshorter the better, but if it's long, things could getrough,&quot; says Bert Ely, a Washington-based bank consultant,who is predicting that 20, mostly smaller, banks will fail inNew England in the coming year, costing the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. as much as $3 billion. &quot;But, clearing out themarketplace of these weak banks is not necessarily bad. Itwill give the stronger banks a clearer field to operate in.&quot;   Mr. Ely says that the $750 million in capital pumped intothe Bank of New England by the FDIC will help ease theregion's credit crunch.   &quot;At the end, Bank of New England was under so muchpressure it was pulling in even good loans, making theoverall credit problem even worse,&quot; says Mr. Kauth. &quot;Now,under the FDIC, that pressure will be eased, as it will if ahealthy bank acquires Bank of New England soon.&quot;   Others are not so sure the takeover of Bank of New Englandwill ease anything.   &quot;Basically, the FDIC's role is as a liquidator, and theyare going to eventually be liquidating like crazy, even afteranother bank becomes their partner in owning Bank of NewEngland,&quot; says Mark Hall, a manager of troubled bank assetsat the Boston-based Hunneman Real Estate Corp. &quot;Andliquidations are going to drive real estate prices down allover the region. That's going to hurt a lot of banks.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;BankAmerica and Banc One Among ThoseIndicating Their Interest to FDIC&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 8, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
