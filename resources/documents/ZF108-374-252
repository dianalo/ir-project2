Hewitt said.andO;&quot;Requirements contracts and IDIQ contracts have served the government verywell.andP;  But over time they will be abused, and somebody will have to putlimits on them.&quot;andM;Colver said members of the House Appropriations Committee are concerned thatthese contracts let program managers pass off the costs of workstations forlarge systems onto small-computer buyers, who wind up paying more thanprogram officials had estimated.andM;James R. Watson, a consultant in Alexandria, Va., said users nevertheless are&quot;browbeating&quot; procurement officials into doing requirements contracts.andO;&quot;There's a perception that the procurement process is broken,&quot; Watson said.andO;&quot;This way, users can avoid going through the procurement process for years.&quot;andM;Watson, formerly an attorney with the Army Information Systems Selection andAcquisition Agency, said IDIQ contracts do not always get the computersdelivered faster.andM;Although machines quickly arrive once the contract has been awarded, Watsonsaid too much time is spent documenting the requirements before the award anddealing with inevitable vendor protests after the award.andM;&quot;Once a contract is awarded,&quot; Watson said, &quot;the technology that was new atthe time it started is rather old.&quot;andM;He stressed that he supports limited use of requirements contracts, pointingto the Air Force's Desktop II as a particularly good one.andP;  But the governmenttends to put too much reliance on them, he said.andM;&quot;Everybody in the government is doing them now,&quot; Watson said.andP;  &quot;It's almostlike a manhood contest.andP;  There can't be as much need out there as there arecontracts.&quot;andM;Watson speculated that contracting officers may relish the publicityassociated with record-breaking contracts.andM;&quot;I think they like to see their names in print or at the top of majorcontracts,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Maybe it helps their careers.&quot;andM;The situation has resulted in contract overlap, he said, particularly in theDefense Department where people have a choice of several requirementscontracts that could meet their needs.andM;As one example, he noted that the Army's $1.3 billion Small MultiuserComputer requirements contract overlaps the Air Force's $700 million DesktopIII microcomputer contract and the Navy's troubled $800 million DesktopCompanion contract.andM;Overlap can keep a contract from a chieving the goals set for it, Watsonsaid, hurting contractors like ATandamp;T Co., which does not appear to be sellingas many 3B2 multiuser machines from its Air Force Standard Multiuser SmallComputer Requirements Contract as company officials had expected.andM;Blurred VisionandM;Eben G. Townes, director of acquisition management services at marketresearch company International Data Corp. Inc. in Vienna, Va., said theproblem worsens as it gets harder to distinguish the classes of computers.andM;&quot;If the differences continue to blur between micros, minis and mainframes,you could buy the same capability from more than one contract,&quot; Townes said.andO;&quot;Ordering from one could breach the other.andM;&quot;There are only so many people in the government; there is a limit to themarket.andP;  I think it will be interesting to see what the Navy will do aboutDesktop Companion because that will affect Desktop III.&quot;andM;Vendors also suffer when the program managers wo put together large systemsdecide to acquire the hardware on their own.andP;  For example, prime bidders forthe Reserve Component Automation System probably will team up with hardwaresuppliers to meet the RCAS requirement for thousands of micros.andP;  That movecould reduce orders substantially for Desktop III computers.andM;An RCAS program official siad, &quot;The supposition is that if a prime contractorteams with a hardware supplier, the prime will be able to get micros cheaper,no matter how cheap Desktop III machines are.&quot;andM;But the government may be driving small companies out of the competition forthese contracts because the small vendors cannot meet the huge projectedrequirements for extended periods, Watson said.andP;  He called it &quot;ananti-competitive situation.&quot;andM;Watson recommended that contracting officers analyze requirements moreefficiently and determine whether a requirements contracts really isappropriate for each computer buy.andP;  He suggested breaking down largeprocurements into pieces worth $50 million to $100 million.andP;  But he addedthat it may be difficult to resist user demands for the huge contracts.andM;Despite these problems, everyone seemed to agree that the benefits ofrequirements or IDIQ contracts often outweigh the disadvantages.andP;  Most peoplesaid they expect to see more such contracts in the future.andM;&quot;For standard off-the-shelf hardware, the IDIQ or requirements contractprobably is the way to go as long as you can come up with a reasonablerequirement,&quot; said Howard J. Grandier, director of software development andinformation technology at the General Services Administration's Office ofTechnical Assistance.andM;&quot;I see more and more of that happening because of the standardization issue,especially with micros.&quot;andM;Bilinski said the savings of large buys will become even more important asDOD's budget is squeezed.andM;&quot;There are great potential benefits for the taxpayer,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Thegovernment needs to redouble its efforts to recruit, train and put the rightpeople into the sensitive jobs&quot; of acquisition and source selection.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
