Henry Waxman charged that the Bushadministration &quot;silenced&quot; a top health official by preventinghim from testifying on U.S. efforts to promote tobaccoexports.   In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary LouisSullivan, the California Democrat alleged that James Mason,assistant secretary for health, was &quot;instructed not topresent testimony&quot; at a congressional hearing on cigaretteexports today. James Brown, a spokesman for Dr. Mason, calledthe charge &quot;nonsense.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The flap highlights the awkward position theadministration finds itself in over the promotion of smoking.Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Mason strongly oppose smoking, and Dr.Sullivan has sharply attacked cigarette advertisements aimedspecifically at women and blacks. But another branch of theadministration, the U.S. trade representative, has beenfighting to tear down foreign barriers to U.S. cigaretteexports. Despite his outspoken opposition to smoking, Dr.Sullivan has refrained from attacking the export promotionpolicy.   Separately, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committeevoted for an anti-smoking bill after deleting a provisionthat the tobacco industry complained would interfere withnationwide advertising campaigns.   As initially introduced by panel Chairman Sen. EdwardKennedy (D., Mass.), the bill would have repealed a federalpreemption of state advertising regulations. This would havefreed states to set their own standards, making nationwideadvertising campaign impossible. Sen. Kennedy said he removedthe provision to avoid a jurisdictional controversy thatcould have bottled up the bill. Remaining provisions of thelegislation would impose new regulations over certaincigarette additives and finance new federal anti-smokingcampaigns.   The cigarette export issue pits health concerns againstexport promotion. Congressional smoking opponents havelaunched a spirited campaign to stop the administration fromexpanding markets for U.S. tobacco companies by threateningtrade reprisals against Thailand and other countries thatlimit tobacco imports.   Dr. Mason had been scheduled to testify today at a hearingwhere a number of witnesses, including the head of theAmerican Cancer Society, are planning to attack theexport-promotion policy. But he withdrew on Tuesday,provoking Rep. Waxman, chairman of the health panel of theHouse Commerce Committee to suggest that &quot;the administrationhas refused to permit Dr. Mason's appearance before us.&quot;   HHS officials rejected this interpretation, saying thatDr. Mason decided not to testify after learning from thedepartment's legislative staff that the hearing was on tradepractices and that an official from the traderepresentative's office was going to testify on behalf of theadministration. &quot;I can assure you that the secretary didn'ttell Dr. Sullivan not to go to that hearing,&quot; Mr. Brown said.&quot;And I can assure you that Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Mason willcontinue to speak out about smoking and health.&quot;   Controversy over smoking is likely to heat up if, asexpected, a proposal to increase the cigarette excise taxemerges during the budget summit as one of the measures tolower the deficit.</TEXT></DOC>
