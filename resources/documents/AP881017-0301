Under the settlement, Bath Iron Works agreed to pay $650,000 infines by January, to correct any outstanding violations by Apriland to drop any legal challenges to the actions by the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration.   ``This settlement reflects BIW's acknowledgment that someviolations did exist and its commitment to implement action wherefurther improvements were needed,'' company Chairman William E.Haggett told reporters at the shipyard.   ``The company also believes the dramatic fine reduction andelimination of (violations categorized as willful) is a significantvindication of BIW's employees and the shipyard's past operationalpractices.''   An OSHA spokesman at the agency's regional headquarters inBoston said it agreed to the 85 percent reduction in the finebecause of the company's willingness to accept the terms of thesettlement.   ``OSHA is not terribly interested in the money,'' John Chavezsaid. ``OSHA is interested in the health and safety of theworkers.''   The shipbuilders union, which had initially vowed to oppose anyreduction, applauded the settlement Monday.   The company and union ``now must concentrate our efforts oncompliance and safety rather than needless litigation,'' said John``Stoney'' Dionne, a spokesman for Local 6 of the Industrial Unionof Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America.   Bath Iron Works, a major contractor for the Navy's Aegis cruiserand destroyer programs, is the state's largest private employerwith more than 10,000 workers.   Last November, OSHA proposed the original $4.2 million fineagainst Bath Iron Works for underreporting employee injuries andillnesses which allegedly occurred between January 1985 and May1987. OSHA also cited the presence of asbestos-laden dust at theshipyard and inadequate testing of toxic concentrations of the dust.   The company denied trying to hide or misrepresent worker-injuryrecords and appealed the fine, which was the largest penalty OSHAhas ever levied against a single company.</TEXT></DOC>
