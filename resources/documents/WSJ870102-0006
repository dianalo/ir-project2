The year saw a mix of good and bad -- unprecedented volume, widespread losses in the first half and profits in the second, and a bewildering array of new products.    The volume of issues backed by mortgages and other assets last year reached $69.6 billion, three times 1985's $22.3 billion. Most of the innovations were in the collateralized mortgage obligation area, which alone accounted for $44.9 billion of 1986's total, compared with $13.5 billion the year before.    &quot;There was a greater proliferation of mortgage products last year than in the previous 10 years combined,&quot; says Laurence D. Fink, co-head of taxable fixed income at First Boston Inc. More than $6 billion of the most popular of these -- floating-rate mortgage-backed securities -- was issued in a six-week period.    The influx of these relatively high-yielding securities almost drowned what had been a thriving European market for corporations' perpetual floating-rate notes. &quot;Why would you buy a perpetual floater yielding Libor (the London interbank offered rate) plus five basis points when you can get a triple-A mortgage floater at Libor plus 50 basis points?&quot; asks John A. Thain, head of the mortgage finance group at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point.    The surge of innovations springs not from issuers' needs, but from investors' demands. As a result, investment banks are doing fewer and fewer issues for clients and more for themselves. More than half of last year's collateralized mortgage obligations were so-called arbitrage issues, in which investment bankers buy mortgages, package them into securities, and then issue the securities themselves, through subsidiaries.    Market participants expect an even greater surge of new products this year, when the so-called Remic provisions of the new tax law go into effect. Last year's innovations divided up mortgage cash flows in new ways, notes Ralph Schlosstein, head of the mortgage and savings institutions group at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The Remic provisions will let issuers divide mortgage pools by credit quality as well, producing what he calls &quot;3-D securities.&quot;    Another potential new product: securities backed by home equity loans. &quot;It's a distinct possibility,&quot; says Robert Andres, president of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital.    Falling interest rates -- good news for other securities markets -- brought heavy losses to the mortgage-backed securities market in the first part of the year. A lot of high-yielding mortgage pools, and the securities they backed, simply evaporated as homeowners refinanced their high-interest mortgages. The spread between U.S. Treasury bond rates and mortgage-backed security rates widened by almost two percentage points, creating severe problems for traders and investors.    The heavy refinancings &quot;brought to light our Achilles heel,&quot; says Lewis Ranieri, head of mortgage securities and real estate at Salomon Brothers Inc., &quot;and like Achilles, we wound up flat on our face.&quot; Market participants disagree about the chances of a recurrence. Some, Mr. Ranieri included, think the market learned its lesson, while others, among them Mr. Fink, believe any substantial drop in interest rates will bring a repeat performance.    There's general agreement that volume and innovation will continue to grow. But the outlook contains some clouds. For one thing, the effect of the new tax law isn't clear yet. While the Remic provisions have been enthusiastically welcomed, other provisions of the tax law could hurt housing finance and lessen thrift institutions' appetite for mortgage-backed securities.    The market's new flexibility also has risks, says Mr. Ranieri. &quot;When you give people new powers, 5% of them are going to blow themselves up.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
