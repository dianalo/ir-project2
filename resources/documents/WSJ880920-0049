Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD PCS </IN><TEXT>   Grain and soybean futures fell sharply in the wake of rain in soybean-producing areas of Brazil, as well as widespread rains in the central U.S.    Weekend rains in Brazil damped speculation that approaching soybean plantings there would suffer from recent dry weather. The South American soybean crop is being closely watched this fall because farmers there are expected to capitalize on the high world prices resulting from the U.S. drought. A major expansion of South American production and exports would depress U.S. prices and cut into U.S. farmers' share of world markets.    Wheat futures also sank amid reports that Hurricane Gilbert replenished soil moisture in winter wheat areas in the southern Great Plains. The winter wheat planting season is just beginning.    Soybean futures led the declines, with prices for November delivery falling 28.5 cents a bushel to $8.31 a bushel. The drop was just short of the daily permitted limit of 30 cents a bushel. Corn for December delivery closed at $2.84 a bushel, down 6.5 cents a bushel.    Analysts said the heavy selling by major brokerage firms that fueled last Friday's declines continued, largely in response to technical factors.    The heavy selling by brokerage houses triggered selling late in the session. &quot;All of a sudden they pulled the plug,&quot; said Daniel Donzelli, grain analyst at GNP Commodities Inc., Chicago.    Soybean futures fell amid rumors that the Soviet Union purchased 100,000 metric tons of soybean meal from Argentina. Analysts said they are expecting a South American sale of 500,000 metric tons of soybean meal to the Soviets.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices plunged following a government report indicating increased production of Florida orange juice. The September contract, which ceased trading yesterday, dropped 5.15 cents a pound to $1.8495. The November contract fell 2.30 cents to $1.7615. The limit prices can rise or fall in one day is five cents. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's tree count and acreage survey, a bi-annual survey, reported a significant expansion in Florida: a 15% increase in acreage to 536,737 acres from 466,252 acres in 1986, and a 25% increase in the number of commercial trees to 54.5 million from 43.5 million two years ago. The first estimate of the 1988-89 season that will begin Dec. 1 and will be announced Oct. 12, is expected to show a significant increase in production, based on yesterday's statistics, according to Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. &quot;Also, the growing weather has been ideal,&quot; she said.    SUGAR: Futures prices dropped sharply on a lack of demand for physical sugar in the world market. The March contract fell 0.56 cent a pound to 9.18 cents. Selling was mostly technically oriented in the absence of fresh fundamental news, according to one analyst. World production is expected to rise, she noted, but demand is expected to keep pace. So, it is uncertain whether there will be a small surplus at the end of the season or a deficit, according to the analyst. Meantime, she noted, there will be moments of weakness, such as at the moment, when there is scant world market demand for sugar.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended mixed as selling continued to depress gold and platinum. December delivery gold declined to a new life-of-contract low of $413.20 before settling with a loss of $2.80 an ounce at $415.40. December silver edged higher by 3.50 cents an ounce to $6.4750. October platinum ended $12.40 an ounce lower at $503, after dropping as low as $500, where it received support. December gold is dropping to near the psychological support level of $400 an ounce and the technical support level of $380, according to Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York. He explained a psychological level as a round figure, such as $400 in gold, that traders seem to focus on. The $380 level is a &quot;support point&quot; based on market considerations, he said. Mr. Hirsch said December gold could fall below $380 because the open interest -- the number of December contracts outstanding that haven't been offset by either an opposite trade or delivery of the commodity -- has been rising as the price has dropped. On Friday, the total gold open interest rose 2,073 contracts to 157,316 contracts. &quot;This means there continues to be new selling that is entering the market and will likely create further pressure on prices,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
