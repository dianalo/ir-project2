U.S. officials are confident the direct negotiations willcontinue -- but not right away. Analysts say nothing willhappen for another 10 days or so -- and then the Israelis andArabs will begin quietly working through U.S. brokers toovercome the problems of picking a site for future talks.</LP><TEXT>   The Palestinian-Jordanian delegation may be willing tomeet the Israelis in the twin port cities of Eilat in Israeland Aqaba in Jordan. But Syria continues to insist on Madrid,while Israel wants the Mideast. If there's no progress in twoweeks, U.S. officials may suggest moving the talks to anAmerican site. One reason for U.S. optimism: Syrian officialsseem to recognize that their posturing in Madrid hurt them inthe West.   Former Carter aide Brzezinski says Syria &quot;would pay a highprice&quot; for pulling the plug on the process -- risking thatthe Golan issue would remain unresolved while other issuesget settled.                                                                                                          FEARS RISE among Bush aides over how Congress will treattrade treaties.   With the economy weak and the campaign looming, officialsfear accords will turn into political footballs. Even as thepresident pushes this weekend for completion of a GATTagreement, domestic resistance rises to U.S. concessions.Sens. Baucus and Danforth warn against abandoning the statuteallowing the U.S. to retaliate against countries with closedmarkets.   Sen. Packwood protests a GATT ruling that the U.S. can'tblock tuna imports from countries that don't protectdolphins. Meanwhile, lawmakers may up the ante for the freetrade pact with Mexico and Canada. Some want Bush to committo a pollution cleanup along the Mexican border, whichenvironmentalists say could cost $9 billion; no one canpromise such a massive effort.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATIC HOPEFULS race to capture the anti-incumbencyflag.   Wofford's startling Senate win prompts presidentialcontenders to be more aggressive. Kerrey strikes a responsivechord with a shrink-the-government proposal. He'll becompeting with Clinton, who girds for his own anti-Washingtoncampaign. Harkin, believing the bare-knuckles tactics thatwon Pennsylvania will prevail in the primaries, plans to takeon Kerrey, arguing that no tax increase is needed to pay fora health-insurance plan.   Tsongas will ratchet up his attacks on the politicalsystem, portraying the Democrats as captive of moneyedinterests. Wilder promotes a $35 billion middle-class tax cutfor &quot;average Americans.&quot; Brown, the self-proclaimed&quot;outsider,&quot; gets a boost; he seeks to portray his rivals aspart of the political establishment.   &quot;I can't wait to see them try to be the party of change --and the party of the status quo in all of the congressionalraces,&quot; says GOP pollster Linda DiVall.                                                                                                          HOT PROPERTY: Wofford's victory sets Democraticpresidential hopefuls scrambling for his consultant, JamesCarville. Kerrey, Clinton, Harkin and Wilder all hope to landhim. But first Carville heads for Louisiana to help battleDavid Duke.                                                                                                          ABORTION-RIGHTS REPUBLICANS mull a New Hampshire primarychallenge -- of Quayle. Under the state's system, they couldput up a rival candidate on the Feb. 18 ballot. Their favoredcandidate: former Republican National Committee co-chair MaryDent Crisp, who says she is open to the notion.                                                                                                          IRAN AND SYRIA shop for help in nuclear-bomb-relatedefforts. Iran works with China, Pakistan, Argentina and NorthKorea to buy materials or missile technology capable ofdelivering a nuclear warhead. The Syrians, meanwhile, shopfor a nuclear reactor that might assist a bomb program.                                                                                                          WORRIED BY the Pennsylvania election, some Bush aides pushhim to make a prime-time TV speech in the next two weeks onthe economy, to show he is in charge and to boost businessand consumer confidence. The speech might include details ofa GOP tax-cut package.                                                                                                          TERM LIMIT PLANS will mushroom despite Tuesday's defeat.   Even though they lost in Washington state, home of HouseSpeaker Foley, proponents predict term limits will carry in adozen states next year -- including Maine, home of top SenateDemocrat Mitchell. Former L.A. County Supervisor PeteSchabarum, who co-authored limits on California's statelegislators, plans a well-financed initiative to curtail itscongressmen.   Most scholars believe that qualifications for Congressonly can be fixed by the Constitution and thus aconstitutional amendment would be required. &quot;There is no way{term limits} could be constitutional,&quot; asserts HermanSchwartz of American University. But advocates are banking onthe political conservatism of the current Supreme Court.   Anti-Congress sentiment on the high court is buttressed bythe addition of new Justice Clarence Thomas.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: A joke making the rounds of the Mideast peacetalks: Bush, Baker and Sununu are in a boat that sinks offKennebunkport. Who survives? Answer: Israel. . . . NewHampshire Democrats supporting Jerry Brown raise money byselling -- you guessed it -- brownies, at $1 apiece. . . .Before former Sununu aide Ed Rogers walked into the huge flapover his plans to represent a BCCI figure, he had alreadyturned down another controversial client -- Imelda Marcos.</TEXT></DOC>
