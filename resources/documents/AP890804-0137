(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Every day at noon, Estonian activistsgather in Tallinn's Old Town to collect signatures for a proposedreferendum on the secession of their Baltic republic from theSoviet Union, a right guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution.   Five years ago, before the reforms of President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, such a petition would have been a sure ticket to prison.Even a year ago, such a notion seemed out of the question.   But for nearly 500,000 non-Estonians in the Baltic republic itcould mean trouble and some are raising their voices in protest.   In late July, several thousand of non-Estonians struck majorfactories in Tallinn, returning to work only when the Estoniangovernment set up a commission to assuage their fears that theymight someday be exiled from Estonia.   ``A lot of people have no other homeland. Where would we go?''said Gennady Korol, of the 56-member coordinating committee ofIntermovement, formed last summer by Russian residents of Estonia.   ``We just want to defend ourselves. We want our children to growup here,'' said Korol, assigned by Intermovement as liaison withthe strikers.   Every day, the drama is acted out at the petition table in OldTown.   A muscular man strides up to the table and writes on a petitionin Russian: ``Throw the Estonians out of the USSR so they won'tdisgrace us.'' He marches off, without signing his name.   The situation is similar in the two neighboring Balticrepublics, Latvia and Lithuanian, where Russian-speaking movementshave organized to counter the march to autonomy.   The conflict stems from the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939,which gave Germany most of Poland and gave Moscow eastern Polandand the Baltic republics. Recent Baltic newspaper accounts havereported that hundreds of thousands of Balts were killed or exiledunder Red Army occupation, and a government commission in Moscow isreviewing the 1939 pact to determine whether Soviet annexation ofthe Baltic republics was legal.   ``A lot of time has passed since the 1940s. It's not our faulthow the war turned out,'' said Korol, who has lived in Tallinnsince his mother, a war widow, married a Red Army soldier and movedhere in 1944, when Gennady was 3.   Since the annexation, hundreds of thousands of non-Estonianshave settled in the republic, working mostly in heavy industriesthat the Estonians complain pollute their environment withoutgiving them material benefit.   Of the 1.6 million people in Estonia, 65 percent are Estonian bynationality, and most of the rest are ``Russian-speakers'' fromSlavic republics, 28 percent Russian, 3 percent Ukrainian and 2percent Byelorussian.   The Baltic republics won a major victory July 27 when thenational legislature in Moscow voted overwhelming for a law thatwould grant them economic autonomy from Moscow starting Jan. 1.   Details remain to be worked out and the law must be voted ontwice more, but Mikhail Bronshtein, author of the idea, said in aninterview it will allow Estonia, Lativa and Lithuania to printtheir own currencies and take control of industry and agriculturefrom Moscow-based ministries.   But ``the Estonian people are realists'' and will not seek fullindependence, said Bronshtein, 66, a member of the Communist Partyand head of the political-economic faculty at Estonia's TartuUniversity.   The Russians will not be exiled, but their status will change,said Rein Veidemann, chairman of the Estonian People's Front, themass movement that is working with the Estonian Communist Party forgreater autonomy.   ``Until now, they have lived like a privileged class,'' he addedin an interview. ``They came, got new apartments more quickly thanEstonians, and quickly landed places in the governing apparatus.   ``We want an equal chance to take part in governing Estonia.''   Russian residents want to stop what they see as the Baltics'slide toward independence. They claim their rights were undercut bylaws recently passn for office.   ``We're against separatism,'' said Vasily Anson, 46, a truckdriver and chairman of the strike committee at the TallinnAutotransport Affialiate No. 8.   Interviewed at the Tallin Ship Repair Yard with other strikers,Anson said his family was exiled from Estonia before the 1917Bolshevik Revolution, and that he settled here in 1965.   ``My wife, a Byelorussian, worked for 22 years in one of theworst factories here, and we just got an apartment in 1987,'' Ansonsaid. The Soviet government owns virtually all housing and much ofits is controlled by state-run factories, such as the one his wifeworks for.   ``Now, the Estonian legislature has passed a law making Estonianthe official language,'' Anson added. ``The other day, we got aletter written in Estonian saying that she must take an examinationin Estonian in two months. If she doesn't pass, she can be firedfor lack of professional qualifications and we will lose theapartment. We will have nowhere to live.''   The Ansons have a 16-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter.   Another strike committee member, shipyard worker MikhailZakariadze, moved to Tallinn from Soviet Georgia in 1983. Hemarried another Georgian two years ago, and they now have twochildren.   After living in dormitories for five years, he became elegibleto move with his family into a two-room apartment last year.   ``But the city executive committee would not let me move there,because I had not lived in Estonia for 10 years. They saidEstonians should get first crack at new apartments,'' saidZakariadze.   The Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee was scheduled tohold a plenum on nationality problems in July, at which the Balticdispute would be on the agenda. But Kremlin leaders have postponedthe session while they grapple behind the scenes with the emotionsthat have boiled to the surface with the greater openness in theSoviet Union.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 13</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
