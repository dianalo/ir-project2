(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Government efforts to curb the flowof smuggled drugs have failed and may have actually boosted profitsfor Latin American cocaine and marijuana growers, a RAND Corp.study said Thursday.   Latin American drug producers make money whether the drugs aresuccessfully smuggled or intercepted, said the study by the privatethink-tank's National Defense Research Institute. If the drugs areintercepted, more must be shipped.   ``Thus, we conclude that cocaine interdiction has probablyincreased the export earnings of producers in Bolivia, Colombia andPeru,'' the study said.   The U.S. government has tripled its spending to battle smugglingand has seized more narcotics, but an even greater amount isgetting through to meet demands of American drug users who can payhigher prices, the study said.   The study noted that from fiscal 1981 to fiscal 1985, seizuresof cocaine rose from less than 2 metric tons to more than 25 metrictons, while seizures of marijuana were halved from 4,000 metrictons to 2,000 metric tons.   Meantime, the study said, the amount of cocaine believed to bereaching the United States rose from between 38 and 68 metric tonsin 1981 to between 111 and 153 metric tons in 1985, the latest yearfor which figures were available.   For marijuana, the amount reaching the United States rose frombetween 8,700 and 12,700 metric tons in 1981 to between 9,447 and12,228 metric tons in 1985.   The study said it based its figures on estimates from the U.S.Drug Enforcement Administration.   From fiscal 1981 to fiscal 1986, federal spending oninterception of drugs rose from $237 million to $801 million, thestudy said.</TEXT></DOC>
