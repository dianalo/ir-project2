(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defrocked evangelist Jim Bakker is``wholly comfortable with the honorable character of the wayHeritage USA was operated under his leadership'' and will pleadinnocent to fraud charges, his attorney said Tuesday.   A federal grand jury on Monday indicted Bakker, founder of thePTL ministries, and former aide Richard Dortch on charges ofdiverting more than $4 million in PTL money to their own use. Eachwas charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wirefraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud.   A second 11-count indictment charged David Taggart, Bakker'sformer personal aide, and Taggart's brother, James, with evadingnearly $500,000 in income taxes and diverting about $1.1 million ofPTL funds for personal expenses.   Bakker's wife, Tammy, was not indicted.   Although Bakker himself remained silent Tuesday on the charges,his attorney, Jim Toms, said the former TV evangelist planned topreach Sunday at his new church in a converted roller rink.   Toms said his client would plead innocent to all of the chargesin the 24-count indictment. The indictment said Bakker, 48, andDortch, 57, engaged in a conspiracy designed to ``create andcontinue lavish and extravagant lifestyles'' by defraudingsupporters who bought lifetime partnerships at PTL's Heritage USAcomplex.   The maximum penalty for each count is five years in prison and a$250,000 fine, which means Bakker faces a possible sentence of 120years in prison and $6 million in fines. Bakker and the otherdefendants are scheduled to appear in court Dec. 15.   Bakker and the Taggart brothers visited the federal courthouse inCharlotte late Tuesday afternoon to pick up summonses ordering themto appear in court.   Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Ray Abrams said the three werephotographed and fingerprinted and gave biographical information tocourt officials to be used when bond is set next week. After abouttwo hours in the courthouse, Bakker left, eluding reporters by goingout a side door.   ``I spent a good deal of time going over the text of the materialwith him last night,'' Toms said in an interview from hisHendersonville, N.C. office. ``It's going to take time now for himjust to study what's there and decide how we go about dealing withit.''   Toms said Bakker's emotional state was good, considering thecircumstances.   ``I'd say he was relieved to see the specifics so he has aproblem he can start working on,'' he said. ``His faith in hisChristian vocation is unshaken and he is determained to do what heneeds to do to work his way through this.''   Bakker ``has indicated he is wholly comfortable with thehonorable character of the way Heritage USA was operated under hisleadership and desires to see its ministry restored and continue,''the attorney said.   Bakker, who began the ministry in 1972, left it in disgrace inMarch 1987 after admitting to a sexual encounter with churchsecretary Jessica Hahn eight years earlier.   After failing to regain control of PTL in bankruptcy proceedingsseveral months ago, the Bakker moved his newly formed Jim andamp; TammyMinistries to a leased brick colonial building on the Yager Estate,south of Charlotte. The Bakkers live in a 14-room log cabin on thegrounds.   Friends and supporters dropped by the Bakkers' home throughoutthe day as security guards kept reporters and photographers at adistance.   Supporters have erected a wooden manger with Christmas lightsoutside the offices. A wooden angel was placed in a fountain by thefront door.   ``The people are cheerful; they're hoping for the best,'' saidDarold Dotson, a former Bakker employee, after delivering a dozenlong-stem roses to the offices.</TEXT></DOC>
