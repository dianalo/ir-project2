In refusing to hear an appeal by MacArthur Co., a long-time distributor of Denver-based Manville Corp.'s asbestos products, the U.S. Supreme Court yesterday removed the last obstacle standing in the way of Manville's successful reorganization. In interviews, company executives were exuberant at the prospect of putting the bankruptcy proceedings behind them.    &quot;It's a day we've worked for for a long, long time,&quot; said Thomas Stephens, Manville's president and chief executive. &quot;The Supreme Court agrees this is the best solution to the problem.&quot;    Manville said the high court's decision will provide relief for &quot;thousands of people injured by asbestos who, we hope, will soon begin to receive compensation for those injuries.&quot; Payments to asbestos victims covered under a $2.5 billion trust set up by Manville had been held up pending Manville's emerging from bankruptcy-court protection.    MacArthur had asked the court to review settlements totaling more than $700 million that Manville had negotitated with its insurers as part of its reorganization plan. MacArthur, which declined comment on the high court's ruling, now has 25 days to apply for a rehearing. Manville has 30 days after that to consummate its reorganization plan.    Manville sought protection from creditor lawsuits six years ago as a means to cope with thousands of lawsuits claiming death, disease or property damage from asbestos.    The bankruptcy court confirmed Manville's reorganization plan in December 1986. But Manville was unable to implement it because of various appeals that were pending. And although the Supreme Court's decision wasn't unexpected, it was nonetheless &quot;monumental,&quot; said Paul Klenaitis, an analyst with Duff andamp; Phelps. After years of operating under the constraints of bankruptcy proceedings, Manville can finally begin &quot;to make the transition to a normal operating business.&quot;    Most Wall Street analysts said that Manville, operating in an interest-free environment and protected from creditor lawsuits for the past six years, should be able to make the transition easier than some had anticipated. For one thing, Manville will emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of about 50%. That compares with an industry average of about 82%. And some building products companies, including Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp. (Manville's chief competitor) have a negative net worth and are highly leveraged.    As a result, a reorganized Manville &quot;will have more financial flexibility than some building materials products companies with which it competes,&quot; said Susan Wolkenfeld, an analyst with Moody's Investor Services Inc.    A big question mark, however, is the extent to which Manville's $2.5 billion trust to pay asbestos victims will drain the company's cash flow and profits over the next 25 years. &quot;What we all want to know is whether there will be anything left over after feeding the trust fund,&quot; said Andrew Gray III of Pershing andamp; Co. &quot;That's the big unknown.&quot;    Indeed, the centerpiece of Manville's reorganization is the creation of two trusts: the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust to resolve asbestos health claims, and the Manville Property Damage Settlement Trust to settle property claims.    Manville has already contributed $150 million to the personal injury trust in anticipation of the company's emergence from bankruptcy. Manville's insurers will pay another $615 million immediately. Starting in 1991, Manville will make annual payments of $75 million until the year 2012. In total, Manville's payments to the personal injury trust will total in excess of $2.5 billion over the next 26 years.    Manville is also obligated to immediately pay $100 million in cash to the Property Damage Settlement Trust. The trust will also receive additional funding from insurance proceeds in excess of the $615 million payable to the personal injury trust, as well as any remaining assets not used by the personal injury trust upon its termination.    In addition, Manville has immediate cash-payment obligations to commercial creditors of $247.5 million once it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings.    But several analysts said the payments, onerous as they are, are sufficiently staggered over a 25-year period that Manville should be able to juggle its trust-payment obligations while continuing to expand its businesses. As Ms. Wolkenfeld put it, &quot;The plan is almost rigged to succeed.&quot;    But Ms. Wolkenfeld acknowledges that because Manville is in a cyclical industry and its trust payments will continue for 25 years, the company is still a highly speculative investment. And its stock price reflects the uncertainty. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Manville closed at $1.75 down 25 cents.    &quot;In the short-term, Manville's prospects are bright,&quot; said the analyst. &quot;But over the long-term, Manville's ability to compete in the industry is less clear.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
