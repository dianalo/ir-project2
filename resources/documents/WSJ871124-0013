The union president led an illegal teachers' strike in New York City and spent 15 days in jail, repeating his act of defiance the next year with a bitterly divisive strike that shut down schools for 36 days and sent him back to jail. Newspapers editorialized against his &quot;shortsighted thrust for power&quot; and pursuit of &quot;political warfare.&quot;    But times have changed, and with them Mr. Shanker. The American Federation of Teachers president -- once a national symbol of militant unionism -- is widely praised as a respected educational leader whose visions of American school reform have shaken up the status quo.    &quot;Shanker is one of -- if not the most -- influential educators in this country,&quot; says Terry Hartle, a resident fellow of the American Enterprise Institute. Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden of Oregon credits him with having &quot;an enormous impact on the way educational policy is made in this country.&quot;    Mr. Shanker's crusade for reform comes at a critical juncture for American public education. With widespread concern about the nation's ability to compete in international markets, education has become a hot political issue at every level. Democratic presidential hopeful Bruce Babbitt calls Mr. Shanker &quot;a genuinely original thinker in education.&quot;    His major theme is the need to &quot;professionalize&quot; teaching, to make it more like doctoring or lawyering. As part of that, he has helped achieve higher salaries and enhanced responsibility for teachers. At the same time, he has pushed for some forms of teacher testing, career ladders, and peer review, though such ideas don't sit well with some of his own union members.    &quot;Public education in America today is perhaps at the same place the auto and steel industries were 15 years ago,&quot; he says. &quot;To preserve our industry we can't just support the status quo or minor cosmetic changes. We can't just put new tail fins on. We've got to build a new car.&quot; At the same time, he says, the teaching profession faces some &quot;devastating problems&quot;: In the next seven years, half the current 2.2 million teachers will leave their jobs because of dissatisfaction or will retire, he estimates.    Already, his union locals have begun carrying out some innovations. In Toledo, Ohio, &quot;mentor&quot; teachers assess and help new teachers and decide whether they will be rehired. In Rochester, N.Y., teachers can do peer counseling, curriculum development and other work traditionally done by administrators. In Dade County, Fla., and Hammond, Ind., teachers help shape education policies.    Mr. Shanker has also championed a potentially revolutionary plan to set up a national system of testing and certifying teachers. Supporters believe it will transform teaching in much the same way board-certification elevated the medical professions, upgrading status and salaries -- to $70,000 or more annually for teachers at the top.    Within the next several years, a national board is expected to start setting voluntary standards for what teachers ought to know, conducting assessment tests and awarding certifications. &quot;It's the most important single idea floating around now,&quot; says Denis Doyle, a research fellow at the Hudson Institute, and &quot;Shanker single-handedly pushed it through.&quot;    The union chief is also a force in Democratic politics. &quot;My experience in 1984 was that when the AFT said they were going to turn out bodies, they did,&quot; says Robert Beckel, manager of Walter Mondale's presidential campaign. Mr. Shanker, he says, &quot;has always had good respect in Democratic politics.&quot;    Mr. Shanker isn't free of criticism or controversy. Some of his reform ideas have drawn ire from administrators and teachers alike. Ted Elsberg, executive vice president of the American Federation of School Administrators, calls his views on giving teachers more responsibility &quot;a usurping of the supervisory and administrative role in schools.&quot;    Mary Futrell, president of the arch-rival National Education Association, contends that among &quot;the people who are in schools&quot; Mr. Shanker is viewed as &quot;being so far out on a limb that he can't come back. They view him basically as trying to get headlines. He'll say or do anything if that's what it takes.&quot;    Even some of Mr. Shanker's admirers think that his focus on reform issues comes at the expense of nuts-and-bolts union problems.    For instance, despite the fact that AFT membership has risen about 45% during his reign, it is still only one-third the size of the NEA. &quot;The bottom line of results has to be whether you're gaining market share on your chief rival,&quot; says Michael Kirst, an education professor at Stanford University.    In his own union, which he runs with a firm hand, Mr. Shanker's conservative views on national defense and affirmative-action quotas are a source of friction. Still, in a bid to unseat him last year, Ellen Lavroff, a Colorado community college professor, won less than 16,000 votes to his 339,683, and she concedes that in the union he is &quot;a hero. He has such a terrific reputation for making that jail trip that people don't question him.&quot;    But some of those who felt his cleats during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s have lingering memories. &quot;The mark of leadership is to stand very tall and to look through the fog and come out with something that is straightforward and direct,&quot; says former New York City Mayor John Lindsay, who thinks Mr. Shanker instead turned a conflict over teacher dismissals and neighborhood control of schools in that city in 1968 into &quot;a polarized fight in the streets.&quot;    Mr. Shanker disagrees with the former mayor's assertions, arguing that he was fighting in New York for fundamental principles. And he doesn't think he has mellowed much in the past two decades.    As he exhorts teachers to &quot;think about forms of merit pay&quot; and other controversial ideas, he says &quot;I'm sticking my neck out.&quot;    The role is one Mr. Shanker assumes readily. A Queens native and the son of Polish immigrants, he spoke only Yiddish until first grade. Teaching in city schools in the 1950s left him increasingly discouraged, though he tried to reach his students with lessons such as this: &quot;If it takes four ounces of poison to kill a person, how many ounces would it take to kill your mother, your father, your sister and your brother?&quot;    In 1959, he went to work as an organizer for the predecessor to New York's United Federation of Teachers, now the AFT's biggest local. He became president of the local in 1964 and, a decade later, head of the international union. Many people outside of New York are familiar with Mr. Shanker through his weekly column, which appears in the New York Times as a paid ad and also runs in about 60 other newspapers, costing the union about $500,000 a year.    Mr. Shanker relinquished control of the powerful UFT local last year but retains his international presidency and at age 59 shows no signs of slowing down. Few can imagine him fading into quiet retirement. Says the Hudson Institute's Mr. Doyle: &quot;The rough edges are smoothed down now. But he would still be a hell of a person in a fight.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
