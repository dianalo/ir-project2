They sought to soft-pedal suggestions that a majority of the morethan 50,000 East Germans reported on vacation in Hungary could joinothers who had formally requested to leave for a new life in theWest.   Maj. Janos Hornyak of the border guards said 6,529 East Germanshad arrived between 6:30 a.m. Monday and 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.   He said that 3,220 East Germans left for home over the same timevia Czechoslovakia, which is sandwiched between Hungary and EastGermany.   Most entered from Czechoslovakia and the rest from Romania, hesaid, adding the figures were normal for this time of year.   Hungarian radio reported without sourcing later Tuesday that 750East Germans arrived from Czechoslovakia during the afternoon and336 left for home.   Hungarian TV said that since the start of the exodus Monday, 103East Gemans illegally crossed from Czechoslovakia into Hungary _presumably to go west over the open borders.   Only 210 East Germans registered overnight with authorities at arefugee camp coordinating the exodus westward.   Some East Germans arriving in Hungary over the last 24 hours werepresumably crossing into Austria on their own, but the low number ofnew registrations also indicated that the stream westward was ebbing.   Hungarian border officials said Tuesday that 16,000 East Germanscrossed into Hungary during the weekend, but said this was not anunusually high number as Hungary is a popular vacation spot fornationals of several Soviet bloc countries.   They stressed that more East Germans _ 26,000 _ left on theweekend than came to Hungary over the same time, cautioning againstthinking that each East German visitor was a would-be refugee.   The exodus to West Germany began Sunday midnight after Hungarydefied a 1969 agreement with East Germany, its Warsaw Pact ally, andopened its borders for thousands who turned their back on theirhard-line communist nation.   Before that, more than 6,000 fled over relatively open stretchesinto Austria after Hungary decided to start clearing its westernmostborder of barbed wire and other barriers in May.   East Germany fiercely criticized the Hungarian move. It was thefirst time a Warsaw Pact country helped citizens of an allied nationflee to the West.   The East Berlin leadership on Tuesday formally protested toHungary and asked it to stop the exodus.   Accusing Budapest of direct interference in East Germany'sinternational affairs, the state ADN news agency said, Hungary was``responsible for the current situation.''   Other reports in the state media suggested Hungary was bought offby West Germany, which grants all East Germans citizenship uponrequest. Hungarian government and Communist Party dailiesemphatically denied it.   Hungarian and East German officials met for weeks trying to agreeon what to do with the refugees, and Hungarian Foreign MinisterGyula Horn said Sunday the borders were opened after the talksfailed.   On Tuesday, Horn told Hungarian radio the East German remarkswere offensive.   As part of major reforms that include free elections planned bynext June, the communist government is drafting laws givingHungarian citizens the right to emigrate freely.   Austrian border officials also suggested that the refugee streamwas ebbing.   They said more than 8,000 crossed into Austria on their way totheir final destination in the first 24 hours, but only anadditional 2,500 did so between Monday midnight and noon. Anadditional 524 crossed during the afternoon, bringing the total toslightly more than 11,000.   That exceeded by about 4,000 the number of refugees whoregistered to leave at seven holding camps.   The busiest of the seven Austrian border crossings Tuesday wasNickelsdorf, about 50 miles south of Vienna.   Hungary's official MTI news agency said authorities planned toclose the refugee camps, but did not say when. All except one werealready out of operation Tuesday. At a facility in the Buda hills,240 East Germans arrived overnight and left for Austria on six busesat noon.   Speculation arose that East Germany would bar further travel toHungary following Hungary's decision. But several new arrivals atZugliget camp told reporters they were allowed to leave theirhomeland less than 24 hours earlier.   But one young woman, who refused to give her name, said EastGerman border soldiers treated some of them roughly before lettingthem cross into Czechoslovakia.   ``They searched through everything,'' she said. ``Some of us hadto undress almost completely. But then we could continue on ourway.''   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath said it was not up to Hungary tostop East Germans from entering and suggested, without specificallysaying so, that Hungary should not stop them from leaving.   ``If East Germany allows its citizens to leave the country, wecertainly cannot restrict their movement,'' he told the Hungariancommunist daily Nepszabadsag.</TEXT></DOC>
