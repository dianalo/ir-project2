Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><CO>   IBM LABOR</CO><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Major changes in high-school education andworkplace organization are needed to emphasize higher skillsand greater worker authority over how jobs are done, a workskills commission said.   The Commission on the Skills of the American Workplacesaid that if both education and work systems aren't revised,the U.S. will continue losing competitive ground to foreignnations.</LP><TEXT>   Most U.S. employers have so far done reasonably well inmeeting foreign competition by using fewer, low-paid workers,with low skills, the report said. But the focus must switchto using better-educated, better-trained employees, with morecontrol over their work, or at least 70% of workers &quot;will seetheir dreams slip away,&quot; the commission said.   The commission was formed by the National Center onEducation and the Economy, Rochester, N.Y., which was spunoff from Carnegie Corp. two years ago. Since 1986, the grouphas issued reports urging restructuring of U.S. schools andgreater flexibility in federal funding of education fordisadvantaged youths.   One company that already follows the high-skill, employee&quot;empowerment&quot; approach is International Business MachinesCorp., the report said. When managers at IBM's Austin, Texas,factory that supplies circuit boards for personal computerssaid they could save $60 million by buying boards elsewhere,IBM had other ideas.   Because it pursues a full-employment, no-layoff policy,managers instead cut costs by upgrading worker skills, thereport said. They organized workers into teams, giving eachresponsibility for its own inspection, repairs and materialsordering. Workers who had performed such indirect tasks wereassigned to production teams, and far fewer indirectemployees were needed.   Job classifications were changed, reorganizingmanufacturing slots into categories with rising skillrequirements, the report said. Education and trainingprograms were launched; the plant now spends more than 5% ofits payroll to teach workers.   According to the report, IBM says that the $60 million gaphas been closed. Productivity is up by more than 200%,quality is five times better, and the inventory has been cut40%. Production has risen 600%, and the plant employs morepeople than ever.   The Austin experience is a good example of what IBM hasbeen doing in the U.S. and abroad, Walton Burdick, seniorvice president for personnel, said in an interview. In bothmanufacturing and service jobs, the aim is to &quot;unleash moreof {workers'} innovative and creative&quot; powers, he said.   With more employee involvement in workplace functions suchas ordering supplies, setting schedules, keeping qualityrecords, maintenance and problem-solving, morale is higherand productivity climbs, Mr. Burdick said.   By contrast, the commission said &quot;the vast majority&quot; ofU.S. employers aren't moving to &quot;high performance&quot; workorganization, which requires educated workers, nor investingto train employees. Fully $27 billion of the $30 billion inannual training outlays is spent by 15,000 companies, only0.5% of all U.S. companies, and fewer than 200 of theseemployers -- large companies with significant professionaland managerial staff -- spend more than 2% of their payrollon formal training, the report said.   The commission is headed by Ira Magaziner, a consultant inProvidence, R.I., and by William Brock and Ray Marshall,former U.S. labor secretaries. The study involvedinterviewing 400 U.S. companies and comparing school andworkplace programs in six foreign nations with those in sixstates. The commission recommended:   -- A new high-level educational performance standardshould be set for high schools, and made a requirement to bemet by age 16.   -- States should assure that nearly all students obtain acertificate that they've met this standard. With federal aid,they should also create alternative learning programs forthose who cannot reach the initial standard in regularschools, and use youth centers to enroll school dropouts.Youths shouldn't be allowed to work before age 18 unlessthey've achieved the certificate or are enrolled in a programtoward it.   -- A thorough system of technical and professionaleducation should be instituted for non-college-bound highschool graduates. Specific occupational skills should becombined with general education.   &quot;Because we have failed to forge a relationship betweenhow well a student does in school and what kind of job he orshe can get, we have turned our high schools into little morethan holding tanks for non-college-bound students,&quot; Mr.Marshall said.   -- Employers should be given incentives and assistance toinvest in further education and training of their workers,and to pursue workplace methods aimed at high productivity.All companies would have to contribute at least 1% foreducation and training.   -- Employment and training boards should be set up by thefederal government and states, to help employers define theirworker skill needs, give workers access to training and helplocal governments and others plan effective labor-marketprograms.</TEXT></DOC>
