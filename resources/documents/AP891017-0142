The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species overrodeobjections from southern African governments, which threatened tofind alternative channels for selling ivory tusks.   ``This will be a great help,'' said Ian Douglas-Hamilton, aNairobi-based expert whose count of 609,000 is the widely acceptedestimate for African elephants, less than half the 1979 total.   ``The African elephant is enormously better off today than itwas a year ago because of international action,'' he said.``Unilateral import moratoriums in the United States and Europe arealready showing results.''   But Wlliam Nduku, head of Zimbabwe's Parks and WildlifeDepartment, called the vote a slap at the few countries whichsuccessfully protect their elephants and count on revenue fromlegal ivory sales.   He said Zimbabwe might withdraw altogether from the convention,known as CITES. Delegates from South Africa, Botswana, Burundi,Mozambique and Malawi said their governments might filereservations to the ban, allowing them to find buyers outside ofthe convention.   The compromise won preliminary approval Monday on a 76-11 votewith four abstentions. The measure sets up a panel of experts toconsider whether countries with well-managed herds might continueto trade legally in ivory.   The measure places elephants on the convention's ``Appendix I,''banning trade in elephant products. Members have 90 days to filereservations, which means they consider their elephants to belisted in ``Appendix II,'' which allows trade.   Some objecting countries said they would organize a ``SouthernAfrican Center for Ivory Marketing'' in Botswana to sell ivorytaken from culled elephants.   South Africa also might market its ivory through the center,overcoming political differences with its frontline neighbors.   ``For us, Appendix I is a dead end. Once our elephants arelisted on it we will never get them off,'' said Pieter Mulder,chief of the South African delegation. He said South Africa willaccept a two-year moratorium on ivory sales until the next meetingof the convention but objected to a ban.   Countries insisting on a ban, including Kenya, Tanzania and theUnited States, argue that any legal trade would open loopholes andencourage poaching in critical areas.   Japan, which has consumed 40 percent of world ivory exports,made no immediate comment. Although Japan temporarily bannedimports last month, it could file a reservation and buy southernAfrican ivory.   ``This vote was a crushing blow to the ivory market which is thecritical factor in the fate of the elephants,'' said Craig van Noteof the Washington-based Monitor Consortium, a network ofenvironmentalist groups. ``Now all nations and citizens must rejectany product made from ivory.''   The long dispute left Africans split and in some cases bitter.   ``Imagine a situation where Trinidad and Tobago are deciding thefate of African elephants,'' said Rowan Martin, director ofresearch in Zimbabwe's wildlife department.   In South Africa, John Ledger of the private Endangered WildlifeTrust urged South Africa to renounce all ivory sales.   ``The ivory trade is rotten to the core,'' he said a statementfrom Johannesburg.   ``By continuing to trade in ivory, South Africa finds itself inthe company of ruthless poachers, smugglers and criminals who willkill the last elephant in Africa to satisfy their greed.''   Ivory is highly valued for its use in the signature stampspopular in many Asian nations and for jewelry, piano keys andcarvings.</TEXT></DOC>
