In West Berlin, police arrested nine members of self-styled``protection troops'' that police said had been cruising thestreets in cars to prevent neo-Nazi attacks against foreigners andJewish landmarks.   West Berlin police also said a Turkish cemetery in the city hadbeen vandalized early today. More than 38 grave stones wereoverturned or damaged, officials said.   In Hamburg districts that have a large foreign population, a``considerable number'' of parents kept their children out ofschools,'' a school board spokesman said. The spokesman, whorequested anonymity, said the parents were reacting to a ``hysteriacampaign that was not founded on facts.''   Neo-Nazi leaflets circulating in Hamburg in recent daysthreatened violence against foreign school children and otherethnic groups.   Hamburg's chief school administrator, Rosemarie Raab, touredseveral schools with a large number of foreign pupils.   Some foreign shopowners closed their stores today in Hamburg.Police said they were not aware of any neo-Nazi actions.   On Wednesday evening, Hamburg police briefly detained 41 foreignyouths who had formed a group to defend against possible neo-Naziattacks. Police said they seized 14 knives and seven pistols thatfire tear gas or Mace.   In West Berlin, police arrested six young men early today afterthey were seen driving around a synagogue.   A police statement said the six had a pistol that fires teargas, helmets, clubs and a gasoline canister in the car. The sixwore anti-Nazi emblems and some had jackets displaying a swastikabeing destroyed by a fist.   Police arrested two men and a woman in another car and alsoseized knives, steel bars and other weapons. The three had a listof 40 places singled out to be watched, police said.   Police said leftist groups apparently formed patrols to respondto any possible violence by the neo-Nazis.   Leftist activists also set up a hotline and urged citizens toreport any incidents involving neo-Nazis.   West Berlin has many foreign workers and a far-right party, theRepublicans, won seats in the local legislature for the first timein January's election after a vitriolic campaign against foreigners.   In the Bavarian mountain resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen,police said a large wooden swastika was set alight late Wednesday.No arrests were made.   Peter Frisch, vice-president of the Federal Office for theProtection of the Constitution in Frankfurt, said foreigners,particularly Turks, are likely targets of the violence.   Turks in recent years have flocked to West Germany in search ofjobs, triggering resentment among many working-class Germans.Rightist groups have made foreign workers a political issue.   ``They (the Turks) have assumed the role that the Jews played inthe Nazi ideology,'' Frisch said on the North German radio station.</TEXT></DOC>
