A method to quickly and easily predictroot system performance and compare mine soils on the basis of theirsuitability for root growth is needed. This study was conducted to determinethe effectiveness of penetrometer resistance and bulk density as parametersfor predicting root system performance. Both penetrometer resistanceand bulk density data fit well into a multiple linear regression modelthat could be used to predict root length density in the lower portionof the root zone ((67-100 cm depth). Results suggest that in the minesoils studied, both bulk density (R{sup 2} = 0.81) and penetrometer resistance(R{sup 2} - 0.73) are useful predictors of root system performance.</TEXT></DOC>
