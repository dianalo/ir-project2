Shell's decision also raises questions about the viabilityof Alaska's Chukchi Sea as a potential oil-producing region.After bidding more than $300 million in 1988 for almost halfthe available leases, Shell drilled four costly explorationwells in the sea but is now turning over the drill ship toanother oil company.</LP><TEXT>   Shell retains a lingering interest in Chukchi. &quot;We haveseven more years on these 10-year leases,&quot; said a spokesman.Executives at some other oil companies say Shell didn't findthe billion-barrel oil fields needed in the icy, high-costarea. Shell won't comment.   Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said the Alaskanproduction it wants to sell consists of two fields in theCook Inlet that total 7,500 barrels of oil production a dayand 23.1 million cubic feet of gas daily. While the proposedsale is a tiny one for Shell -- the output represents 1.6% ofits average 1990 daily production -- it is consistent withShell's efforts to downsize while building up earnings.   &quot;It's symptomatic of the need of the company to focus onthe areas where it makes the greatest amount of money and topull out of areas where it makes less,&quot; said Bernard Picchi,an oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.   For the second quarter, Shell posted a $68 million loss,its first deficit in 57 years. The company has begun anaggressive retrenchment that includes laying off 10% to 15%of its work force in the next 12 to 18 months. Shell has putup for sale its Los Angeles-area oil refinery; the companyhas said it will close the plant if no buyer steps forward,which appears an increasingly likely outcome.   In addition, Shell is trying to auction some West Coastoil wells, also without apparent success. Shell also shiftedits exploration and production strategy to be more short-termoriented. The company spokesman wouldn't comment on theprogress of any asset sales.   After initial excitement, opinion is now mixed on thepotential for the Chukchi Sea. It was opened up to oilcompanies with much fanfare three years ago in a federallease sale. At the time, optimists believed that one or twofields in the sea -- located near the nation's largest field,Prudhoe Bay -- could contain several billion barrels ofreserves and could be so-called &quot;company makers&quot; for thediscoverer.   Many interpret Shell's drilling halt as a sign it foundnothing. But some remain hopeful. &quot;It's early yet,&quot; saidJames Dunlap, president of Texaco U.S.A., a Texaco Inc. unitthat also holds acreage in the Chukchi Sea. &quot;There are a lotof producing areas today that took 10, 15 or 30 wells beforea significant well was discovered.&quot;   But if a large strike were made the extremely hostileenvironment would probably preclude production until nextcentury. For now, companies can only drill during the summerwhen ice is thinnest.   Whatever the geologic potential of the Chukchi Sea, Mr.Picchi, the oil analyst, said that after a recent trip toAlaska he is convinced that many Alaskans fear anenvironmental disaster and vehemently oppose drilling. Hesaid some Alaskans were hinting that if the oil industrypulls out of the sea, the state will offer greater support toopening for drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Thearea is believed to contain sizable reserves.</TEXT></DOC>
