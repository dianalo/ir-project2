Background </ITAG>On July 14, 1986, EPA issued a final rule that revised the standards forhazardous waste storage and treatment tank systems (51 FR 25422). Sincethen, the Agency has received requests for interpretation of a number ofterms or provisions of the final rule, and has found several typographicalerrors in the rule. In addition, the revised tank system standards werechallenged by industry petitioners in <T3>Edison Electric Institute (EEI). et al. </T3>v. <T3>U.S. EPA</T3>, No. 86-1549 (D.C. Circuit). This notice provides additionalinterpretation and clarification of the final rule, both in response topublic inquiry and in settlement of the <T3>EEI </T3>litigation. This notice also corrects a number of typographicalerrors. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Issues Requiring Interpretation </ITAG>Three major areas of the final rule require further clarification: (1)The exemptions for wastewater treatment systems and elementary neutralizationtank systems, (2) issues concerning secondary containment requirements,and (3) the applicability of the immediate response exemption under 40CFR 265.1(c)(11) and 270.1(c)(3). A. Scope of the Exemptions for Wastewater Treatment/Elementary NeutralizationTank Systems <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Effect of Revised Tank System Standards on Wastewater Treatment/ElementaryNeutralization Units </ITAG>On November 17, 1980, EPA promulgated an amendment to the hazardous wastestandards that suspended applicability of the requirements in 40 CFR Parts122 (now codified in Part 270), 264, and 265 to owners and operators ofwastewater treatment tanks and elementary neutralization tanks (45 FR 76074).In the July 14, 1986, revised standards for hazardous waste tank systems(51 FR 25422), the Agency, in response to evidence indicating a high incidenceof failures in piping and other equipment ancillary to tanks, made a specialeffort to focus on the proper management of such equipment. Thus, all equipmentthat is ancillary to the tank and used ``to distribute, meter, or controlthe flow of hazardous waste from its point of generation to a storage ortreatment tank(s), between hazardous waste storage and treatment tanksto a point of disposal on-site, or to a point of shipment for disposaloff-site'' was made subject to the revised standards (see definition of``ancillary equipment'', 40 CFR 260.10). EPA used the term ``tank system''to emphasize that both the tank and its ancillary equipment must be managedin accordance with the revised standards. EPA has received several inquiriesregarding the extent to which the term ``tank system'' might result inpreviously exempt wastewater treatment/neutralization tanks being regulatedby the revised hazardous waste tank system standards. In the July 14, 1986, rulemaking, the Agency had no intention of alteringthe scope of the November 17, 1980, exemption for such units as providedunder 40 CFR 264.1(g)(6), 265.1(c)(10), and 270.1(c)(2)(v) by subjectingthe ancillary equipment of such exempt tanks to regulation. EPA attemptedto make this point clear in the preamble of the revised standards (see51 FR 25462). However, numerous parties believe the preamble language isstill ambiguous. This ambiguity was also an issue in the <T3>EEI </T3>litigation. To add to the confusion of the status of theseexemptions, EPA inadvertently neglected to amend the 40 CFR 260.10 definitionsof ``elementary neutralization unit'' and ``wastewater treatment unit''to reflect the Agency's intent to address hazardous waste tank systems,rather than simply hazardous waste tanks. In this notice, EPA correctsthis oversight.In order to remove any remaining ambiguity over this issue, EPA is todayamending the wastewater treatment and elementary neutralization unit definitionsto clarify that the exemptions apply to the tank systems, not just thetank. The only additional equipment intended to be covered under the revisedstandards was ancillary equipment that is associated with a regulated hazardouswaste storage or treatment tank. Thus, if a wastewater treatment or elementary neutralization unit is notsubject to the RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste management standards, theancillary equipment connected to the exempted unit is likewise not subjectto the Subtitle C standards. Similarly, the exemptions apply to sumps thatmeet the definition of a tank in 40 CFR 260.10 and that are used for thepurpose of conveying hazardous wastewater to an exempted wastewater treatmentor elementary neutralization unit (including conveyance by way of intermediatesumps, tanks, and holding ponds) since such sumps are ancillary equipmentto the exempted tanks. Also, the revised hazardous waste tank system standardsdo not apply to ancillary equipment that is associated with hazardous wastemanagement units other than storage or treatment tanks (<T3>e.g., </T3>surface impoundments). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Clarification of ``Wastewater Treatment Unit'' </ITAG>One of the conditions under 40 CFR 260.10 for qualifying as a wastewatertreatment unit is that the unit must be part of a wastewater treatmentfacility that is subject to regulation under either section 402 or section307(b) of the Clean Water Act. EPA has received numerous inquiries regardingthe meaning of the term ``wastewater treatment facility.'' Based on EPA's property-boundary interpretation of the term ``facility''under RCRA and the purpose of the exemption, which is to exclude tank systemssubject to regulation under the Clean Water Act, it is EPA's position thatin order for a wastewater treatment unit to be covered by the exemption,it must be part of an on-site wastewater treatment facility. Accordingly,any hazardous waste tank system that is used to store or treat the wastewaterthat is managed at an on-site wastewater treatment facility with an NationalPollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit or that dischargesto a Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), is exempt from the RCRA regulations.Whether the wastewater is conveyed from the tank system directly to thetreatment unit or indirectly by way of intermediate sumps, tanks or holdingponds does not affect the applicability of the exemption. For example,this exemption would apply if a sump is used to collect the rinse fromperiodic cleaning of utility boilers and this wastewater is then conveyedto a wastewater treatment unit at the same facility. Also, the means ofconveyance of the waste between storage and treatment does not affect theapplicability of this exemption. The applicability of the exemption doesnot depend on whether the wastewater is piped or trucked, or conveyed inany other manner to the wastewater treatment facility within the boundariesof the facility generating the wastewater. Likewise, the applicabilityof the exemption does not depend on whether the on-site wastewater treatmentfacility also treats wastewater generated off-site. However, any tank system that was employed in managing wastewater at afacility prior to its off-site transfer to another location, whether ornot the off-site location includes an NPDES permitted wastewater treatmentfacility, or a facility that discharges to a POTW sewer system, is notcovered by this exemption. EPA intends that this exemption apply to any tank system that manages hazardouswastewater and is dedicated for use with an on-site wastewater treatmentfacility. However, if a tank system, in addition to being used in conjunctionwith an on-site wastewater treatment facility, is used on a routine oroccasional basis to store or treat a hazardous wastewater prior to shipmentoff-site for treatment, storage, or disposal, it is not covered by thisexemption. Unless the tank system otherwise qualifies for some other exemption,it would be subject to the revised standards for hazardous waste tank systems.A final clarification of this exemption concerns an on-site wastewatertreatment facility that has no discharge to surface water. As previouslystated in 45 FR 76078 (November 17, 1980), the wastewater treatment unitexemption is intended to cover only tank systems that are part of a wastewatertreatment facility that (1) produces a treated wastewater effluent whichis discharged into surface waters or into a POTW sewer system and thereforeis subject to the NPDES or pretreatment requirements of the Clean WaterAct, or (2) produces no treated wastewater effluent as a direct resultof such requirements. This exemption is not intended to apply to wastewatertreatment units that are not required to obtain an NPDES permit becausethey do not discharge treated effluent. B. Issues Regarding Secondary Containment Requirements The Agency has also received numerous requests for interpretation of theregulatory provisions concerning the secondary containment requirements.The areas of confusion include; the meaning of welded flanges, the exemptionfor certain types of joints and connections, the exemption of above-groundsealless valves, the extent of required leak detection for concrete liners,and the secondary containment of pressurized piping with automatic shut-offdevices.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Welded Flanges </ITAG>The primary purpose of a flange is to enable connection of piping to vessels,pumps, valves, and other equipment. A flange connection provides an easymeans of removing equipment from the pipe system for inspection, maintenance,repair, or replacement. Like other piping connections, flanges can be joinedto piping by two basic techniques: threaded joints or metallurgical bonds(e.g., welds). If a piece of equipment is connected to piping by a threadedjoint, it may be difficult to remove the equipment without disassemblyof a portion of the piping system or without loosening other pipe-threadedconnections. If the equipment is welded to the pipe, the pipe must be cutto remove the equipment. In contrast, equipment joined together with flangedconnections can be easily removed by unbolting the flanges. In andSection;andSection; 264.193(f) and 265.193(f) of the revised hazardouswaste tank system standards, EPA exempted welded flanges from the requirementto have secondary containment as long as the flanges were visually inspectedon a daily basis. Numerous questions have been raised as to the intendedmeaning of the term ``welded flange'' because EPA did not define this termin the July 14, 1986, final rules. Apparently, several different meaningscan be attributed to the term. A term typically used in national piping codes, ``welded flange'' refersto welding only the piping to the flange. The flange-to-flange seal isachieved by mechanical seals, such as gaskets and o-rings. The flangesare usually held together by bolts. For a perfect seal, the bolt holeswould have to be eliminated, and a circumferential weld made at the flange-to-flangejoint. However, EPA is not aware of any national standards or codes thatdiscuss this type of weld. And, most important, such a weld would defeatthe purpose of the flange_i.e., to allow easy coupling and uncoupling ofequipment from the piping system. In exempting welded flanges from secondary containment, EPA intended todiscourage the use of threaded joints, which EPA believes are susceptibleto more frequent and larger quantities of releases than welded flanges.Threaded joints are used in metals where the walls are thick enough towithstand considerable pressure and corrosion after reduction in thicknessdue to threading. Threading is not a precise machining operation, and fillermaterials such as ``pipe dope'' are necessary to block the spiral leakagepath. Several characteristics of threaded joints make them more susceptible toleakage than welded flanges. Threads notch the pipe and reduce its strengthand fatigue resistance. Enlargement and contraction of the flow passageat threaded joints creates turbulence. Thus, corrosion and erosion maybe aggravated at the point where a pipe has already been thinned by threading.The tendency of pipe wrenches to crush pipes and fittings limits the torqueavailable for tightening threaded joints thereby possibly excluding thenecessary amount of tightening. For low-pressure systems, a slight rotationin the joint may be used to impart flexibility to the system, but thissame rotation may cause leaks to develop in higher-pressure systems. Insome metals, galling (i.e., a wearing down) occurs when threaded jointsare disassembled. Flanged joints come in a wide variety of types and facings. Welded-neckflanges provide joints as strong as the pipe under all types of staticand cyclic loading. Slip-on, socket-weld, and lap-joint flanges providejoints as strong as the pipe under static loading but have lower resistanceto cyclic stresses. EPA realizes that flanged connections cannot be considered equivalent toan all-welded pipe system without flanges and will, therefore, pose a potentialleak source. However, welded flanges eliminate, in EPA's opinion, the pointof most probable leakage_i.e., the threaded pipe connection to the flange.With respect to potential leakage, flanges are superior to threaded connectionsbecause of the higher quality and more consistent workmanship and supervisionassociated with flange assembly and because of the inherent problems withthreaded joints discussed above. While the flange-to-flange seals can leak,the occurrence of leakage from flanges is much lower than from threadedjoints due to the larger seal surface area for the flange joint (a largesurface on flange face versus a few sealing threads in the threaded connection).Also, with proper selection of bolt materials and washers, the mechanicalseal can be kept under continuous compressive force, whereas the threadedjoint relies on thread sealing compound to compensate for the contractionand expansion of the threaded joint. In any case, if a leak does occurin the mechanical seal it can be easily detected visually and correctedimmediately. Weld-neck and lap-joint flanges are preferable to socket-weld and slip-onflanges because they provide the greatest resistance to static stress.Socket-weld and slip-on flanges provide a lesser degree of structural integritybecause the welds may eventually weaken, particularly from cyclical stress(vibration, hammering, opening/closing of valves, etc.). Nevertheless,EPA believes that any of these welded flanges, if properly specified, installed,inspected, and maintained in accordance with American National StandardsInstitute (ANSI), American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), andother piping component standards, and if properly managed in compliancewith the revised hazardous waste tank system standards (e.g., compatibility,design certification, installation certification, inspections, and responseto leak/spills), should pose a very low risk of leakage. For example, aproperly designed piping system should take cyclical loading into accountand use pulsation dampers, flex joints, expansion joints, etc., to eliminateor substantially minimize the effect of cyclical stresses. Thus, as specifiedon the revised tank system rules, the Agency believes secondary containmentis not necessary for aboveground welded flanges (i.e., welded at the jointof the pipe to the flange) that are visually inspected on a daily basis.For the purpose of andSection;andSection; 264.193(f) and 265.193(f) EPA interpretsthe term ``Welded flange'' to mean weld-neck, lap-joint, slip-on, and socket-weldflanges. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Applicability of Exemption for Certain Types of Joints and Connections</ITAG>Since promulgation of the revised tank system standards, EPA has receivednumerous inquiries regarding the intended scope of the exemption from secondarycontainment for welded joints and welded connections. For example, inquirershave requested clarification on the applicability of this exemption toplastic piping connections, and compression, soldered/brazed, and othertubing connections. A wide diversity of joints/connections can be used in the constructionof a hazardous waste tank system. Considering the broad spectrum of reliabilitythat can be expected of the joint/ connection, given such variables asmaterial of construction, method of joining, quality control of joint/connectionassembly, etc., the issue is which types of joints/connections are sufficiently``welded'' so as to be exempt from the requirement of secondary containment.In general, and as previously discussed, one of EPA's main concerns lieswith threaded fittings and joints. As explained below, fittings and jointsthat avoid the inherent problems associated with threaded fittings andjoints, and that thereby provide a more reliable connection, are the typesof fittings and joints most likely to be considered ``welded'' (that isto say, permanently joined in such a fashion as to be comparable to weldingin reliability) and thus eligible for exemption from the secondary containmentrequirement. This exemption is only applicable to aboveground piping systemsthat are visually inspected on a daily basis. a. <T3>Plastic piping connections. </T3>Plastic pipe and fittings may be joinedby a solvent-cement, by heat fusion, or by a mechanical device such asthreads or a ring seal. A brief description of each type of joint is givenbelow: andbullet; Solvent cement softens the surfaces of the components, which thensolidify as the solvent evaporates. andbullet; With heat fusion, the surfaces are heated with special tools untilthey have softened. When engaged, the softened surfaces flow together,forming a joint as the material cools. There are three basic types of heat-fusedjoints: butt fused, socket or insert fused, and saddle fused. andbullet; Mechanical means or devices can be used to develop a pressureseal. Types of mechanical joints include threaded joint, compression gasketjoint, compression fitting joint, clamped insert-fitting joint, bell-and-spigotgasket or push-on joint, flanged joint, and flare joint. Of all the joining techniques, solvent-cementing and heat fusion can beconsidered equivalent to welding in metal pipe systems. In both cases,the plastic is melted or ``welded'' together. The choice of the particularbonding depends on the type of plastic. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) and chlorinatedpolyvinylchloride (CVPC) pipes are solvent cemented, but polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and polypropylene (PP) pipes require heat fusion, sincethey are not susceptible to solvent cementing. As with all joining techniques,the leak characteristics depend on the quality of workmanship involved.If the plastic components are properly joined, the risk of leakage shouldbe the same as that of welded pipe. According to ASTM standards, the pressure rating of solvent-cemented joints,properly fabricated, is equivalent to the pressure rating for the originalpipe, after a reasonable time has been allowed for the joint to cure. Thepressure rating of well-made, heat-fused joints is the same as the pressurerating for the original pipe after the material in the joint has cooledto the pipe temperature. However, EPA notes that care must be taken in the selection and applicationof a particular plastic pipe. The pipe must be suitable for the internalfluid and the external conditions. For example, some pipes may need tobe wrapped to prevent stress cracking from ultraviolet light. Flared-tube joints, insert fittings, and threaded joints are not as reliableas heat fusion and solvent-cement joining techniques and have a greaterincidence of leaks than do the welded pipes. Of these, threaded jointshave the greatest likelihood of leaking, insert fittings the next greatest,and flared-tube joints the least likelihood of the three. Depending on the type of material and/or the manufacturer, certain joiningdevices may lower the maximum pressure rating of the piping system. Typically,threaded and mechanical joints of particular plastics may lower the maximumpressure rating (of the pipe joined) by as much as 50 percent. Given this information, EPA is convinced that solvent-cemented and heat-fusedconnections in plastic piping systems are analogous to welded metallicconnections and should thus be considered ``welded'' for purposes of theexemption from secondary containment requirements under 40 CFR 264.193and 265.193. Mechanical joints, however, would need secondary containment.The methods used to join plastic pipes and fittings depend on the typeof plastic(s) being joined. Applicable ASTM practices should be consultedto ensure that the method used is compatible with the materials being joined.In addition, the recommendations of the manufacturer should be consideredwhen determining which method and the details of the procedure to be used.The ASTM standards provide specifications, test methods, practices, andguides for plastic pipes and fittings made from these plastics. Plasticpipes and fittings made from several other types of plastic_most notablypolypropylene (PP) and poly(vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF)_are commonly availablein a wide variety of sizes. However, they are not covered as such by ASTMspecifications. b. <T3>Tubing connections. </T3>Since promulgation of the revised standardsfor hazardous waste tank systems, the Agency has received numerous questionsconcerning the equivalence of tubing components to all-welded piping. Thesecomponents, used in making connections to valves, instruments, pressuregauges, and other ancillary devices, employ soldered and brazed joints,compression-fittings, and flared-fitting joints. EPA does not have sufficient information to determine that these typesof connections are equivalent to ``welding'' and thus is not exemptingthese connections from the requirement of secondary containment. The Agencybelieves that further consideration of an exemption for these connectionsis necessary and welcomes any data that addresses the reliability of theseconnections. i. <T3>Soldered and brazed joints. </T3>Soldering is a metal-joining processwherein a nonferrous alloy is heated to a suitable temperature and fusedto the metals being joined. The filler metal (solder) is distributed betweenclosely fitted surfaces of the joint by capillary attraction. In general,solders are lead-tin alloys and may contain antimony, bismuth, and otherelements. Soldered joints are most widely used in pipe or tubing sizes 2 inches andsmaller where the heat requirements are less burdensome. Properly made,the joints are completely impervious. Soldered joints should not be usedin areas where plant fires are likely because exposure to fire rapidlyand completely melts the joints. Nor should they be used where the pipecontains flammable or toxic fluids or where the piping is subject to thermalshock or mechanical vibrations. Brazing is a metal-joining process wherein a nonferrous metal is heatedto a suitable temperature and fused to the metals being joined. The fillermetal is distributed between the closely fitted surfaces of the joint bycapillary attraction. Silver-brazed joints are similar to soldered joints, except they requirea temperature of about 1100anddegrees;F for fusion to occur. Silver-brazedjoints are used where temperature or the combination of temperature andpressure is beyond the range of soldered joints. They are also more reliablein the event of plant fires and are more resistant to vibration.Braze welding is a welding process using a nonferrous filler metal havinga melting point below that of the base metals, but above 800 anddegrees;F(427 anddegrees;C). The filler metal is not distributed in the joint by capillaryattraction. EPA believes that soldered and brazed fittings are not equivalent to weldedpiping. Regardless of how well these joints are made, they will continueto be a greater source of leakage than a welded connection, which has thestrength of the pipe itself. However, if installed properly and withintheir design limitations, EPA believes that these joints have a very lowrisk of leakage. If a leak does occur, it should be visually detected inmost circumstances, and tubing normally has a piping take-off valve forisolation. Tubing also generally has small bores so leaks will normallybe minor, except in high-pressure service. Although the Agency acknowledges that these types of connections are somewhatless reliable than a welded connection, EPA believes that the combinationof a relatively low risk of leakage, the required compliance with standardsfor proper design, installation, and inspection, and the impracticalityof designing secondary containment for such connections may make a reasonablecase for exempting these connections from the requirement for secondarycontainment. The Agency is continuing to study this issue and may amendthe regulations in the future to provide such an exemption for these connections.ii. <T3>Compression Fittings. </T3>A compression fitting can be an integralpart of a tank system component (e.g., the fitting is built into the valveor pressure gauge), or it can be a separate piece that is threaded to thecomponent. These fittings are used where the tubing has too high a ratioof wall thickness to diameter for flaring or where the tubing lacks sufficientductility for flaring. The seal is made by a ferrule ring that is slippedover the end of the tube and compressed onto the tube by a compressionnut on the fitting. The ferrule ring has two sealing surfaces: a smooth-boreinner-diameter surface that is compressed onto the tube surface, and asmooth conical-shaped outer-diameter surface that makes a metal-to-metalseal to a matching machined-cone surface in the body or housing of thecompression fitting. The sleeve must be considerably harder than the tubing,yet still ductile enough to be diametrically compressed. It also must beas resistant as the tubing to corrosion by the fluid handled. Because theferrule is under great compression force, a very tight seal is obtained.This force is usually sufficient to overcome differences in coefficientsof thermal expansion of the materials used for the tube and fitting, normalvibration, and other factors that would cause threaded joints to leak.Properly designed and manufactured compression fittings rarely leak. Theyare used in highly critical applications, such as connections for fuellines and hydraulic systems on aircraft. Flareless compression fittingsare used extensively and can be designed for systems up to 60,000 poundsper square inch gauge (psig). The ANSI B31.3 Code lists no restrictionsfor compression fittings, except that they be safeguarded if used in severecyclic conditions. Leaks, when they occur, are usually attributed to oneof the following causes: _Dirt or debris trapped on the sealing surface; _Improper torqueing (too loose or over-tightening); _Wear or scoring from excessive removal and reinstallation of the connection;_Damage from handling during installation or removal; or _Excessive vibrations or bending moments at the tube-to-fitting interface.EPA believes that compression fittings used on metallic tubing may be nearlyas reliable as welded connections. EPA is considering amending the rulesto exempt metal tubing that uses compression fittings (but not with a threadedconnection between the fitting and device) from the secondary containmentrequirement. The Agency is convinced, however, that secondary containment should berequired for plastic piping connections that use compression fittings.Although plastic piping can be joined in a manner similar to compressionfittings for metal piping, the technique is substantially different. Sincemetals are ductile, the ferrule metal seal and the tubing are both actuallycompressed by the compression nut. On the other hand, plastics are notas ductile or as strong as metals, and a seal is made by the much lowercompressive force of an elastomer sealing ring. Thus, EPA does not believethat these plastic systems afford sealing equivalent to that of solvent-cementedor fused joints. iii. <T3>Flared-fitting joints.</T3> Flared-fitting joints are used for ductiletubing in cases where the ratio of wall thickness to the diameter is smallenough to permit flaring without cracking the inside surface. The tubingmust have a smooth interior surface. A flared fitting that employs a sleeveavoids torsional strain on the tubing and minimizes vibration fatigue onthe flared portion of the tubing. More labor is required for assembly,but it is more resistant to temperature cycling than other tubing fittingsand is unlikely to be damaged by over-tightening. For these fittings, lesscontrol of tube diameter is required. The Agency believes that flared-fitting joints, although not as reliableas compression fittings, still present a low risk of leakage. However,given the lack of available data on the reliability of flared-fitting joints,EPA is unable at this time to determine whether these joints should beexempted from the requirement of secondary containment. The Agency mayconsider this issue in a future rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Exemption of Aboveground Sealless Valves </ITAG>As previously discussed, 40 CFR 264.193 and 265.193 of the final rule exemptcertain aboveground piping system components from the secondary containmentrequirement. EPA has received several inquiries regarding an apparent inconsistencybetween the discussion of these exemptions in the preamble (51 FR 25450,July 14, 1986) and the list of exemptions codified in 40 CFR 264.193(f)(1)-(4)and 265.193(f)(1)-(4) (51 FR 25475 and 25481). Sealless pumps are exemptedunder andSection;andSection; 264.193(f) and 265.193(f) because they do notuse traditional packing materials, which are a common source of leakage.Similarly, the Agency intended to exempt sealless valves, as mentionedin the preamble discussion, provided that a welded connection is used tojoin the sealless valve to the piping. However, the regulatory exemptionrefers to sealless pumps, but not sealless valves. Thus, today EPA is correctingits omission of sealless valves from the regulatory language of 40 CFR264.193(f)(3) and 265.193(f)(3) by adding sealless valves to the list ofpiping components that need not be provided with secondary containment.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Extent of Required Leak Detection. </ITAG>Sections 264.193(b) and 265.193(b) set out the performance standards forsecondary containment systems. Additional details on how to meet theseperformance standards are found in andSection;andSection; 264.193(c) and 265.193(c).EPA has received several inquiries regarding the intent of the wordingin 40 CFR 264.193(c)(3) and 265.193(c)(3) which states that secondary containmentsystems must be:<ITAG tagnum="21">Provided with a leak-detection system that is designed and operatedso that it will detect the failure of either the primary or secondary containmentstructure or the presence of any release of hazardous waste or accumulatedliquid in the secondary containment system within 24 hours * * *.</ITAG>Numerous inquirers took this provision to mean that the Agency was intendingthat a leak detection capability be provided both within, and externalto, the secondary containment structure. Several other inquirers requestedclarification of whether the Agency requires detection of failure of eitherthe primary or secondary containment structures or the presence of anyrelease, or both. Under this provision, EPA intended that the leak detection component ofa secondary containment system promptly detect any release from the primarystructure into the secondary containment structure. EPA used the wording,``Provided with a leak detection system that is designed and operated sothat it will detect failure of either the primary or secondary containmentstructure'', to ensure that double-walled tanks which detect failure ofeither the primary or the secondary containment structure (e.g., via lossof pressure in the interstitial space between the two walls) meet the requirementsof andSection;andSection; 264.193(b) and 265.193(b). This provision shouldnot be interpreted to require leak detection outside of the secondary containmentstructure in order to detect failure of the secondary containment structure.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Requirements for Concrete Liners </ITAG>In 40 CFR 264.193(e) (1) and (2), and 265.193(e) (1) and (2), EPA promulgatedstandards applicable to external liners and vault systems. The externalliner requirements of 40 CFR 264.193(e)(1) and 265.193(e)(1) address thesubject of liners generically. For example, they do not differentiate betweensynthetic membrane liners and concrete. On the other hand, the requirementsfor vault systems under 40 CFR 264.193(e)(2) and 265.193(e)(2) are applicableonly to concrete. However, EPA did not intend that concrete used, for example, as a baseand diking material for secondary containment of an aboveground tank oronground tank should be subject to requirements significantly differentfrom concrete that is used in the construction of a secondary containmentvault. Certain of the requirements promulgated for concrete vaults areappropriate and are intended to be applied to situations where concreteis used in the construction of any secondary containment structures. Thus,concrete liner systems must also meet the more specific requirements of40 CFR 264.193(e)(2) (iii) and (iv) and 265.193(e)(2) (iii) and (iv) inorder to meet the general performance standards under 40 CFR 264.193(e)(1)(iii) and (iv) and 265.193(e)(1) (iii) and (iv), which specify that theliner system be free of cracks or gaps and designed to prevent migrationof the waste. Chemical-resistant water stops at all joints, as specifiedin 40 CFR 264.193(e)(2)(iii) and 265.193(e)(2)(iii) are appropriate forany concrete structure serving as a secondary containment device. Likewise,given the relative permeability of concrete, the Agency believes that mostsecondary containment concrete structures, vaults or otherwise, will requirean impermeable coating or lining that will prevent migration of waste intothe concrete as specified in 40 CFR 264.193(e)(2)(iv) and 265.193(e)(2)(iv).Such coating or lining must also be compatible with the waste(s) managedwithin the secondary containment structure. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Secondary Containment of Pressurized Piping with Automatic Shut-OffDevices. </ITAG>EPA has received a number of questions regarding the exemption from secondarycontainment of pressurized piping with automatic shut-off devices.Under 40 CFR 264.193(f)(4) and 265.193(f)(4), aboveground pressurized pipingsystems with automatic shutoff devices that are visually inspected on adaily basis are exempt from the secondary containment requirement. Furthermore,this provision allows this exemption even if welded flanges, welded joints,welded connections, sealless valves, and sealless or magnetic couplingpumps are not used. However, the Agency is reconsidering this exemption.EPA may have over-estimated the effectiveness of automatic shut-off devices.Although these devices should certainly limit the quantity of waste releasedin case of a substantial failure somewhere in the piping system (e.g.,pipe rupture), they would be unlikely to have any effect on reducing thenumber or size of releases in piping systems due to small or slow leaksat valves, connections, flanges, etc. It was not EPA's intent to prescribe less importance to small leaks inpressurized piping systems. In fact, such less-than-major leaks would beof greater concern in pressurized piping systems compared to nonpressurizedsystems due to the potential to release larger quantities of hazardouswaste. Thus, the Agency believes that it may be prudent to require all abovegroundpiping systems, pressurized as well as nonpressurized, and even with automaticshut-off devices, to use welded joints, sealless valves, sealless or magneticcoupling pumps, etc., in order to be exempted from the secondary containmentrequirement. In fact, automatic shut-off devices may also need to be weldedso as not to be a source of leakage. Using this approach, automatic shut-offdevices might be used to protect against catastrophic releases and serveas a means to limit the size of the secondary containment system(s), whereneeded, rather than serve as a means for the entire piping system to beexempted from secondary containment. EPA is considering proposing suchan amendment to the tank system standards in the near future. C. Extent of Cathodic Protection for Primary Tanks EPA received several inquiries regarding the intent of the 40 CFR 264.193(e)(3)(ii)and 265.193(e)(3)(ii). That regulation specifies double-walled tanks mustbe ``protected, if constructed of metal, from both corrosion of the primarytank interior and of the external surface of the outer shell * * *.'' Apparently,this wording has been interpreted to mean that cathodic protection mustbe provided for the interior surface of the primary tank. This was notEPA's intent. With respect to the interior of the primary tank, this requirement waschiefly intended to address the excessive or accelerated corrosion of theprimary tank's interior surface resulting from incompatibility betweenthe tank construction material and the stored waste(s). This provisionthus reiterates the requirement found elsewhere in the standards (e.g.,40 CFR 264.191(b), 264.192(a)), that accelerated corrosion of the primarytank's interior surfaces must be prevented. However, this provision doesnot mandate cathodic protection of the interior surface of primary tankstructures. D. Application of the Immediate Response Exemption to Sumps As part of the settlement of the <T3>EEI</T3> litigation, EPA agreed to clarify the applicability of theimmediate response exemption under 40 CFR 264.1(g)(8) and 265.1(c)(11)to sumps. The July 14, 1986, final rule discussed three types of sumpsthat may be regulated as tanks under this revised rule: ``temporary tanks,''secondary containment sumps, and primary containment tanks. With respectto temporary tanks, i.e., tanks used for storage of waste in response toa leak or spill, and other temporary, unplanned occurrences, the Agencystated that no Subpart J standards were applicable since such storage wasexempted from these regulatory requirements under 40 CFR 264.1(g)(8) and265.1(c)(11) (51 FR 25445). Those sections (along with 40 CFR 270.1(c)(3))exempt any person from permitting requirements and regulatory standardsfor ``treatment or containment activities taken during immediate responseto * * * [a] discharge of a hazardous waste'', except requirements concerningpreparedness and emergency procedures. The purpose of the exemption isto allow appropriate immediate response to hazardous waste discharges inemergency situations where treatment or storage is necessary but the facilityowner or operator would not have had sufficient previous warning to complywith regulatory standards or obtain a RCRA permit for such treatment orstorage (51 FR 25445, July 14, 1986); (48 FR 2509, January 19, 1983). Asump that may be used to collect hazardous waste in the event of a spill,whether accidental or intentional, and that is not designed to serve asa secondary containment structure for a tank storing hazardous waste, isgenerally exempt from regulatory and permitting requirements so long asit is used to contain hazardous waste only as an immediate response tosuch a spill. Sumps that serve as part of a secondary containment system, i.e., to collectspills from a primary containment vessel storing hazardous waste, are subjectto all applicable requirements for tank systems except for the requirementto obtain secondary containment. (51 FR 25441, July 14, 1986). In contrastto ``temporary tanks'', secondary containment sumps and all other secondarycontainment structures, are specifically designed to serve as the collectiondevice for spills of hazardous waste from an adjacent primary containmentvessel. Finally, except as noted in section II.A. above, sumps that store hazardouswaste as primary containment vessels are subject to all tank system requirements,including the requirement to obtain secondary containment (or a variance).Primary containment sumps are sumps designed to collect and transport routineand systematic discharges of hazardous waste (51 FR 25441, July 14, 1986).Sumps designed to serve as the storage for hazardous waste from periodiccleaning of utility boilers, for example, are primary containment vessels,although as explained above they will still qualify for an exemption fromthe tank system requirements if they are used as ancillary equipment toan exempted wastewater treatment or elementary neutralization unit. SeeSection II.A. <T3>supra. </T3>In short, upon consideration of 40 CFR 264.1(g)(8) and 265.1(c)(l1) andthe interrelationship of these provisions with the July 14, 1986 finalrule, EPA believes that some sumps may be exempt from regulation underthis provision. This interpretation is consistent with the preamble discussionof the spill exemption provision (48 FR 2508, January 19, 1983). As explainedin that preamble, the purpose of the provision was to address emergencysituations, whether due to accidental discharges or to spills during routinemaintenance of equipment, where there is no time to comply with technicaland procedural requirements pertaining to storage and treatment of hazardouswaste (48 FR 2509, January 19, 1983). This rationale is inapplicable tounits constructed for the purpose of containing hazardous waste from routineand systematic discharges of hazardous waste or designed to serve as thesecondary containment for a tank system treating or storing hazardous waste.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Correction of Typographical Errors </ITAG>On August 15, 1986, EPA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a notice of corrections to the revised finaltank system standards (51 FR 29430). Since that time, a number of additionaltypographical or coding errors in the final rules or in the notice of correctionshave been brought to EPA's attention. Several coding errors were a result of EPA's omission on several occasionsof the word ``system'' when the term ``tank system'' as opposed to ``tank''was intended to be used. In general, it is the Agency's intent that botha regulated hazardous waste tank and its ancillary equipment be subjectto the revised standards of July 14, 1986. As such, EPA promulgated a definitionof ``tank system.'' Although the Agency tried to ensure that the term ``tanksystem'' was incorporated, wherever applicable, into the final rule, EPAapparently overlooked several situations where this term should have beenlikewise inserted. As previously discussed in Section II.A.1, the definitionof ``elementary neutralization unit'' and ``wastewater treatment unit''should have included the term ``tank system.'' Likewise, the word ``system''was inadvertently omitted from 40 CFR 264.190 and 265.190. In these paragraphs,the exemption from secondary containment was intended to apply to any tankand its ancillary equipment, i.e., any portion of the tank system, situatedinside a building with an impermeable floor. In 40 CFR 264.190(b) and 265.190(b)a different omission occurred. Although the Agency's intent is not to requiresecondary containment of tank systems, including sumps, that serve thepurpose of secondary containment, EPA does intend that these secondarycontainment systems, or portions thereof, must meet the design, installation,and operation requirements for a secondary containment system in accordancewith 40 CFR 264.193(b)-(i) and 265.193(b)-(i). It is EPA's intent thatthese units be exempted only from 40 CFR 264.193(a) and 265.193(a), that,in any case, is redundant of the provision requiring secondary containment.Another omission occurred in 40 CFR 264.193(f) and 265.193(f) in that EPAneglected to include aboveground sealless valves under the exemption fromsecondary containment. As evidenced in the preamble discussion for theJuly 14, 1986 standards (51 FR 25450), it was the Agency's intent thatthe exemption be applicable to these valves. A detailed discussion of thisomission is provided in Section II.B.3. EPA, in the process of including tank systems in the applicability sectionof the closure and post-closure requirements in Subpart G (40 CFR 265.110),inadvertently deleted the previously existing 40 CFR 265.110(b)(2), thataddresses the applicability of Subpart G to waste piles and surface impoundments.Consistent with 40 CFR 264.110, EPA is today reinstating this provisionin 40 CFR 265.110 and renumbering the paragraph as applied to tank systems.Today's rule also incorporates a conforming change into 40 CFR 264.114and 265.1l4. In the revised tank system standards, EPA promulgated specificclosure and post-closure care requirements in 40 CFR 264.197 and 265.197and stated that tank systems also must meet the requirements of SubpartsG and H, unless otherwise specified. EPA neglected to make the cross-referencein 40 CFR 264.114 and 265.114 to allow alternate post-closure care forcertain tank systems as specified in CFR 264.l97 and 265.197. Several typographical errors have also been brought to the Agency's attention.In the first Note for 40 CFR 264.196 and 265.196, the reference to RCRAsection 3004(u) and 3004(w), respectively, is a mistake. The correct referenceshould be RCRA section 3004(v). Another typographical error appeared in40 CFR 265.201(c)(3) where a wrong citation of a paragraph was made. Insteadof referring to ``40 CFR 265.192(c),'' a provision that has nothing todo with the level of waste in a tank, ``40 CFR 265.201(b)(3),'' requiringthat uncovered tanks be operated to ensure at least 60 centimeters of freeboard,should have been cited. In this notice, EPA is also correcting these errors.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Compliance With Administrative Procedure Act Requirements </ITAG>Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act generally requires proposalof administrative rulemakings to receive public comment prior to promulgation.However, section 553(b) excludes certain types of rules from the priornotice-and-comment requirement, including interpretative rules and rulesfor which public comment is unnecessary. Because today's notice includesonly interpretative statements concerning existing hazardous waste tanksystem requirements and minor technical corrections, prior notice and thesolicitation of public comment on this notice is unnecessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 260, 264, 265, and 270 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Environmental protection, Hazardouswaste, Tank systems, Waste storage and treatment, Water pollution control,Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 24, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.W.
