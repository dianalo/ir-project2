Being tried with him are Toshiro Ono, an executive of RecruitCo., the information conglomerate Ezoe founded, and two politiciansaccused of taking bribes: Takao Fujinami, a former Cabinetminister, and Katsuya Ikeda of the opposition Komeito (CleanGovernment) party.   If convicted, the defendsants could be sentenced to five yearsin prison each.   Their trial is the last of five, which began Nov. 22 in TokyoDistrict Court and will last for months as the legal system delvesinto allegations of corruption in in the cozy relations betweenJapanese government and business.   The Recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned last spring afteracknowledging he received large donations from Recruit.   Other key figures in the governing Liberal Democratic Party havebeen sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of rankingbureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted fromRecruit.   Ezoe, 53, is charged with seven counts of bribery and Ono, a39-year-old former company department head, with two counts.   Fujinami, 56, was chief Cabinet secretary under Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, Takeshita's predecessor. He is accused ofreceiving 20 million yen ($140,000) and 10,000 shares inRecruit-Cosmos, a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influentialpeople at a reduced price before going on the market.   He allegedly put pressure on the Labor Ministry not to changethe traditional season for recruiting college graduates, whichwould have hurt Recruit's sales of job-placement magazines.   Ikeda, 52, is harged with receiving 2 million yen ($14,000) forhimself, 5 million yen ($35,000) for his wife and 5,000 shares inRecruit-Cosmos for his brother.   According to prosecutors, he gave pro-Recruit speeches inParliament in return. Ikeda resigned his seat; Fujinami remained inParliament, but resigned from his party.   The other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other Recruitexecutives.   Prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe.Japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official orpolitician receives money or valuables from people or companies theofficial is in a position to supervise.   Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos tohundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before thestocks were available to the general public.   When it was offered on the over-the-counter market, the price ofthe stock shot up and the insiders made large profits. Fujinami'sshares were said to have gained him 30 million yen ($215,000).   ``We offered stocks to those who would bring benefits to Recruitdirectly or indirectly. It was a form of advance investment. Iregard the stock transaction as a business practice but I admit itcontains some peculiar aspects,'' Ezoe was quoted as tellingprosecutors, who read the statements in a related trial Wednesday.   On Wednesday, the former chairman of Nippon Telegraph andTelephone Corp., Hisashi Shinto, 79, acknowledged he made about 21million yen ($145,000) in 1986 on Recruit-Cosmos shares, but deniedfavoring Recruit with special treatment when it entered thetelecommunications market.   ``I accepted the offer of shares, but I never regarded it as abribe,'' he said. ``Rejecting such an offer is considered rude inJapan.''   Defense lawyers have argued such favors were normal betweenbusinesses and the powerful bureaucracy in Japan, where an entireindustry has evolved around the custom of exchanging gifts tocement personal and business ties.   Businessmen say such gifts are not aimed at winning specificfavors but at establishing relationships with business associates,supervising agencies and politicians that make it easier to dobusiness with them.   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has pledged to reform Japan's moneypolitics, but few measures have been enacted.   On Wednesday, Parliament passed legislation providing punishmentfor politicians who give donations for weddings and otherceremonies they do not attend, and for voters who demand such gifts.</TEXT></DOC>
