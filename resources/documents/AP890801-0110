Col. WilliamHiggins by his Lebanese kidnappers, and military action is ``in therealm of the possible,'' an administration source said.   Officials emphasized, however, that Bush had not decided on acourse of action, and one source said that both a potential hostagerescue operation and a military strike were ``not attractiveoptions.''   Administration officials said diplomatic contacts were under wayin the meantime.   White House officials said they were still trying to gather thefacts. ``We still cannot offer any confirmation of his death or thecircumstances surrounding it,'' said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   Bush met for 90 minutes with Secretary of State James A. BakerIII and other top administration officials to review theintelligence from Lebanon. ``This session was primarilyinformational,'' Fitzwater said.   He emphasized the White House was going about other business aswell, and Bush still planned to host a barbecue for members ofCongress this evening.   ``We do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere,'' the spokesmansaid.   Fitzwater said the United States was in contact with allcountries in the region, but there was no direct communication withIran, which backs Moslem militants believed to have seized Higginsin February 1988.   At the State Department, however, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid the United States has sent messages to Iran through``established channels.''   The message, also sent to other countries, is that ``there canbe no excuse for the killings of our hostages,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.``This is outrageous behavior. It is uncivilized. It excludes whotake this action or support it from the community of civilizednations.''   Other officials said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadzewas asked by Baker during a meeting in Paris on Monday to conveyU.S. concerns to Iranian authorities when her visits Tehran thisweek.   Fitzwater reiterated Bush's call on all parties to releasehostages. Asked if the United States regarded Sheik Abdul KarimObeid, a Shiite Muslim cleric seized in Lebanon by Israel, as ahostage or a prisoner, the spokesman said: ``I don't want todictate any political terms for political purposes. ... It's prettyclear he was kidnapped.''   Asked about reports that terrorists have delayed by 48 hourstheir threat to kill another American hostage, Joseph JamesCicippio, Fitzwater said, ``We feel there should be no deadlines,there should be no hostages.''   Bush on Monday issued ``an urgent call to all, all parties, whohold hostages in the Middle East to release them forthwith, as ahumanitarian gesture, to begin to reverse the cycle of violence inthat region.''   One U.S. official, who spoke on condition he not be identified,said there was still no final confirmation that Higgins was theperson seen hanging in the videotape released by the Shiite Moslemkidnappers.   The official said ``nothing has been ruled out'' in retaliationfor the reported execution of the 44-year-old Higgins, who wasassigned to a United Nations peacekeeping force.   As for the possibility of military action, the source said,``It's in the realm of the possible.''   ``No one is tilted in that direction. It's on the menu. No one'sordered it ... We're not leaning necessarily toward anything,''said the official. ``People are discussing the options. We are notat the specific choosing stage.''   Presidential assistant Stephen M. Studdert said Bush wasconcerned ``that every military option, for example, has with itthe possibility that those sites may be a place where American or,in the case of Terry Waite, British hostages, are held.''   He said Chief of Staff John Sununu discussed ``the constraintsof military options'' at some length in a staff meeting.   A source described the president as ``outraged, incensed, butcognizant of the limitations on his options and the need to beresponsible. He doesn't believe you should fight terror withterror.''   The reported execution of Higgins touched off the first foreignpolicy crisis of the Bush administration. It also led the presidentto criticize Israel's abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric fromLebanon on Friday. Higgins' kidnappers cited the Israeli action inannouncing the American's execution by hanging.   ``On Friday, I said that the taking of any hostage was nothelpful to the Middle East peace process. The brutal and tragicevents of today have underscored the validity of that statement,''Bush said Monday night.   Israel today welcomed Bush's call for release of the hostagesand said its offer to swap the cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, forWestern hostages and Israeli captives still stands.   An Israeli Embassy spokesman, David Peleg, said today thatIsrael carried out the abduction ``only after we reached theconclusion that all other means had failed to gain the release ofour hostages, not the Americans.''   Administration officials said Ambassador William Brown met witha top Israeli official early today to discuss the situation.   Meanwhile, former hostage David Jacobsen told CBS News and theLos Angeles Times that the abduction of Obeid may have destroyedchances for the release of Associated Press correspondent TerryAnderson, the longest-held of the eight current American hostages.   ``All the reports were that Terry Anderson was to be releasedlast Saturday night, and because of the kidnapping of the sheikthat obviously was postpned,'' Jacobsen told CBS today.   Observers in Washington and the Middle East, and Anderson'ssister Peggy Say, they had not heard any such report.   Bush cut short a two-day Western trip on Monday and returned toWashington after learning that Higgins' captors had released avideotape they said showed his execution. The president met withhis top advisers before briefing congressional leaders Monday night.   While Bush publicly said he had no independent confirmation ofHiggins' death, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said thepresident told the lawmakers that ``it's about a 98 percentprobability'' that Higgins had indeed been killed.   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,said Bush was considering ``several options'' to respond toHiggins' death. But like other lawmakers at Monday night's meeting,he declined to identify them.   Earlier, Dole, R-Kan., had criticized Israel for its role intouching off the crisis. Declaring that Israel launched thecommando raid to abduct Obeid without forewarning the UnitedStates, Dole said, ``Perhaps a little more responsibility on behalfof the Israelis would be refreshing.''   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, withoutelaborating, ``It's fair to say that many people do share thesenator's concerns.''   Israeli officials rejected criticism of their commando raid,saying Obeid had helped plan and carry out several terroristoperations including Higgins' kidnapping in February 1988. Rep.Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said blaming Israel for Higgins' deathwould be ``turning the world on its head.''   One administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity,said U.S. officials had more meetings planned on the crisis, and itwas premature to say Bush had ruled out military retaliation orrescue missions.   The White House made clear to congressional leaders that theUnited States had been kept in the dark about Israel's plan tokidnap Obeid on Friday, according to one lawmaker who attended thebriefing.   Israel says Obeid is a leader of a pro-Iranian group that isholding foreign hostages in Lebanon. An Israeli Army spokesman saidObeid admitted he was involved in Higgins' kidnapping.</TEXT></DOC>
