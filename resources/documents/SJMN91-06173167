John Seymour recognizes the need to act nowto protect the California desert (Mercury News, June 9) despite protests fromsupporters of development.;    Two things are abundantly clear to mostproponents of desert protection: Parts of the California desert remainincredibly beautiful, and in spite of past abuse, would easily complementYosemite and other national parks as a jewel in the nation's crown, and thoseparts are threatened by the steady encroachment of degrading intensive uses,such as off-road vehicles, military exercises, mining, utility corridors,roads, grazing, energy development and urban expansion.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DEVELOP DESERTS NOW? OR LET OUR KIDS DO IT?  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Opponents of desert protection have already degraded millions of acres ofdesert:;    (check) Off-road vehicle users (a tiny minority of desert users)have half a million acres at their disposal (with no change proposed by theDesert Protection bill), and use much more because of lax management.;   (check) The past production of mines in the California desert is minuscule,but the very few significant deposits all are protected for mining by theDesert Protection bill (the supposed $7.7 billion worth of minerals in theEast Mojave National Scenic Area alone cited in your article is disinformationcreated by the Bureau of Mines in the absence of scientific data and ignoresthe costs of extraction).;    (check) Grazing is barely nicked by thelegislation and could be eliminated entirely from the California desert andnot make a dent in the nation's supply of beef and lamb.;    (check) Thelegacy of military activities, now 50 years old, is still vividly inscribed onthe desert, and the proliferation of roads and utility corridors has made theCalifornia desert the most accessible in the world.;    Do we really need toconsume more desert acreage, or is the desert threatened by plain personalgreed? I disagree strongly with the Sierra Club's spokesman, who says &quot;publiclands issues are really a philosophical issue.&quot; Land use issues are central toour survival -- it's a question of whether we choose to wreck all of ournatural environment right now, or to set aside a portion of it for ourchildren to see and enjoy.;    Maybe, following our example, they will chooseto wreck what's left. But shouldn't they at least have a choice?;    -- HowardWilshire; Mountain View  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910621  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  398  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 21, 199100173167,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
