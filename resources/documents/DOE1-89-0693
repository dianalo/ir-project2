<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0693 </DOCNO><TEXT>An integrated system of communicating automata for distribution substationsis presented. The system is designed to meet security constraints, maximumpower availability and cost efficiency. Four automatic control functionsare specified and linked using Petri nets: Auto-Reclosure, High ImpedanceGround Fault Search, Zero Voltage and Under Frequency Load Shielding.This set of automata exhibits a number of properties, which are impossibleto assure with stand-alone machines, due to improved communications affordedby the integrated design. Taking as an example the closure of a feeder,it is proved that, while running in parallel without mutual inter-lockings,the automata never close the feeder if any one is in disagreement. However,the closure will always be executed before all automata return to rest.The Petri nets model is implemented on a single 16-bit microprocessor.The key ingredients are a multi-tasking real-time kernel which providesa virtual processor for each automation and a synchroniser which managesthe communications.</TEXT></DOC>
