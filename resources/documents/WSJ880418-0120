Washington would drive down the dollar, and all those Toyotas would cost more. Then Detroit could drive back the Japanese by selling more Fords, Chevys and Plymouths, thus putting Americans back to work and cutting the trade gap.    Washington did its part. In less than three years, the yen has nearly doubled in value and Japanese cars have never been so expensive.    But now some people are wondering if Detroit welshed on its end of the deal.    American cars have never been so expensive, either. Big Three auto makers aggressively raised prices right behind the Japanese in a determined -- and remarkably successful -- effort to increase profits. Instead of being pushed into retreat, Japanese car makers enlarged their share of America's new-car business last year to the highest level since 1982.    &quot;Japanese prices go up, American prices go up,&quot; and the consumer pays more for all kinds of cars, complains Rep. Sam Gibbons, the Florida Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade. &quot;They're not trying to recapture market share.&quot;    There &quot;was, if not an explicit, then certainly an implicit understanding,&quot; says Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and co-founder of the Congressional Competitiveness Caucus. &quot;Government does its part to readjust exchange rates, the auto industry {does its part} to increase productivity, decrease overhead and regain market share.&quot; Detroit is getting efficient, he says, but retaking lost ground is playing second fiddle.    Of course, there were never any formal promises. And domestic car makers bristle at the suggestion they chose greenbacks over growth. &quot;We think we have been aggressive&quot; in keeping prices down, says Robert O'Connell, financial vice president of General Motors Corp. &quot;We've gone after market share,&quot; insists David N. McCammon, Ford Motor Co. vice president in charge of finance. Ford market share did jump two points last year, though the gains came mostly at the expense of GM.    Some profess surprise at the way things turned out. &quot;I really expected . . . we would wax the Japanese, and we didn't,&quot; declares Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler Corp.    But to others, like Vladimir Pucik, an authority on the auto industry at the University of Michigan, comments like that are what's surprising. &quot;It's the same old game, the traditional obsession with short-term profits rather than boosting market share,&quot; says Mr. Pucik.    During the mid-1980s each dollar was worth about 240 yen, making Japanese cars a bargain here. To force those prices up, Ford pleaded with Washington to help get the dollar down to around 180 yen; GM and Chrysler essentially agreed. In late 1985 the Reagan administration got Japan and other allies to go along with a weaker dollar. Now the dollar is flirting with 120 yen, a boon beyond Detroit's fondest dreams.    But here the simple arithmetic ends. That's because since 1981, Japanese car makers have voluntarily limited their U.S. sales to defuse protectionist sentiments. As Japanese cars sold out, waiting lists developed, and buyers started paying unofficial premiums of up to $2,500 a car.    American auto makers even then immediately recognized a grand opportunity; they raised their prices. In 1984 alone, consumers were forced to pay an extra $3.3 billion for Japanese cars and an extra $5.2 billion for domestic cars because competition had been curbed, says a study by the U.S. International Trade Commission.    &quot;What we did was transfer billions of dollars from consumers' pockets into the Big Three,&quot; claims Robert Crandall, a Brookings Institution economist who has studied the auto industry. (Ford, among others, says studies such as the ITC's discount several important factors, such as consumers' choosing more upscale cars.)    Then came the tumbling dollar. The Japanese have increased prices of some models as much as one-third over the past three years to reflect the dollar's drop. Once again, Detroit raised most published prices, though staying behind its rivals.    But this time, transaction prices -- what buyers actually pay for cars -- reveal a differing impact on buyers. Part of the increase in base sticker prices on Japanese cars was offset as dealers dropped the premiums they had been tacking on. Detroit never had any premiums, so its price increases landed squarely on consumer pocketbooks.    In the two years up to mid-1987 (the latest data in hand), consumers paid 11.8% more for domestic models and 9.3% more for Japanese cars, says J.D. Power andamp; Co., a market-research firm. That includes the effect of Detroit's nonstop &quot;incentive&quot; discounts.    Last fall, domestic makers added another wrinkle: They made standard much equipment that had been optional, and raised base prices to reflect that.    The results now are highly visible.    First, Japanese imported cars edged up to 21.3% of the U.S. market in 1987 from 20.7% in 1986. (Imports as a whole grabbed a record 31.1% of U.S. car sales, up 2.8 percentage points from the year before.)    More important, the Big Three's cumulative profits soared 25% last year, to a near-record $9.5 billion. Ford's profit in 1987 set a one-year record for the industry. That kind of money means something for everyone: a $250 million executive bonus pool, three dividend increases in a year for shareholders, and, earlier in the year, a contract for workers with wages nearly 50% higher than the national average for all manufacturing workers. Though GM's profit wasn't so spectacular, its workers got the same deal, and it set aside $157 million for executive bonuses.    To the irritation of some economic strategists, however, the trade-gap picture shows little change: In all of 1987, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in new-car trade was $22 billion, about flat with 1986. Trade data released late last week did show a fall in the dollar value of cars imported from Japan in February, but that isn't being viewed as significant because monthly auto import figures tend to bounce around.    As far as Detroit is concerned, the reason the Japanese auto-trade figures aren't dropping as hoped isn't because American car prices went up too much. It's because Japanese car and light-truck prices didn't go up as much as they should have to fairly reflect the value of the yen. So now U.S. manufacturers have publicly accused the Japanese of dumping trucks; that is, illegally selling them here for less than in Japan and doing Detroit harm.    And at a minimum, say Chrysler and Ford, Congress should press for new trade restraints beyond the &quot;voluntary&quot; quota that holds Japanese exports to the U.S. to 2.3 million cars a year.    Domestic makers go to some lengths to explain away their price moves. GM reasons that on many of its 1988 cars, prices are actually lower than last year. That's because even though it heaped on more standard equipment, it didn't raise prices by as much as the items used to cost as one-by-one options. Also, it says that a lot of the added equipment was purchased anyway by &quot;better than 80%&quot; of customers.    That may be true on some models, but not all. Last fall, the base price of the popular Chevrolet Cavalier sedan was bumped up 10%, or $746, not only to cover an AM-FM stereo radio previously bought as an option by 75% of customers but also for color-coordinated seat belts and an upgraded transmission sold as options on fewer than 10% of the cars before.    &quot;It's a smokescreen,&quot; says George Hoffer, a Virginia Commonwealth University economist who studies auto pricing. &quot;They're adding high-markup standard equipment, not all of which would be bought. They aren't reductions, they're price increases.&quot;    In view of the increased equipment, &quot;sure, consumer outlays have gone up but prices don't necessarily go up,&quot; counters George Eads, GM chief economist. Not even that distinction, however, accounts for how GM priced its l987 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. GM downgraded the standard radio and could claim only added rust protection and new headlamps as notable improvements. The price went up $493, or 4.5%.    When a U.S. maker does undercut the Japanese, it works. But then prices go back up. In 1986 Chrysler brought out $5,495 Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon &quot;America&quot; models, cutting the price $710 while tossing in $684 in equipment. As sales soared, Chrysler raised the price a total of 9.1%.    Last year Chrysler did it again with &quot;America&quot; versions of the Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant, reducing prices 16%. This time it loaded many of the cars with options right away. At a recent auto show, Chrysler displayed a Reliant with &quot;$6,995&quot; in large type on the window sticker but in small print a final price, including options, of $9,706.    Customers caught on, and sales didn't perk up until Chrysler trimmed the price of an optional-equipment package.    Obviously, the Japanese have a few things of their own helping them stay in the hunt. They have slashed production costs back home, where the strong yen makes it cheaper for them to buy imported raw materials. Also, Americans are still willing to pay extra for coveted Japanese quality.    Will l988 be any different? Lately, the Big Three have been pushing big new sales incentives, prompting some analysts to suggest Detroit may finally be girding to fight for market share. Chrysler also has cut the base price of a few models.    Sales of domestic cars gained 15% in the first quarter. The share of the market taken by Japanese imports fell back a couple of percentage points, indicating some Japanese autos have crossed the price threshold with U.S. buyers.    However, the Big Three may have delayed too long to damage Japanese car makers' position here. The bulk of the yen's appreciation is past, so Detroit won't soon see another price run-up in Japanese cars. Also, the major Japanese car makers, partly to offset the strong yen, are rapidly constructing plants in the U.S.    When those plants come on line the price umbrella afforded the Big Three by the strong yen will start to leak and will ultimately collapse. Then, say industry experts and Big Three executives alike, Detroit will find it harder than ever to defend its home turf. </TEXT></DOC>
