Tom Asimos Texarkana, TXandM;A.andP;  You could be having two different problems: Your drive could haveproblems writing to floppies, or it could be having problems readingfloppies.andP;  If the problem is intermittent and the drive isn't damaging everydisk you insert, there's no way to confirm that your trouble is with writing.andO;You can, however, establish whether the drive is reading floppies properly.andO;The next time you get the &quot;minor repairs&quot; message, don't repair the disk.andO;Instead, eject it and insert it into a different Mac.andP;  If it works on anotherMac without giving you an error message, it's likely that the floppy drive onyour Macintosh is not reading disks properly.andP;  In any case, you should see aqualified technician as soon as possible to get your drive inspected.andM;Much To Do about DAsandM;Q.andP;  I've been searching in vain for two years for a DA that would let me keepmy &quot;To Do&quot; list.andP;  When I complete a task, I'd like to be able to click on itto save it to another list of completed tasks.andP;  I've seen programs thatalmost do this, but do not as a DA.andM;Also, I'd like to know if it's possible to use a spare 128K Mac as a printserver? Craig A. Marin Brookline, MAandM;A.andP;  Acta, an outline-processing DA from Symmetry Software (86303 E. RoyalPalm Road, #110, Scottsdale, AZ 85258; [602] 844-2199), is an excellentchoice for keeping &quot;To Do&quot; lists.andP;  Although it doesn't let you click on acompleted task and save it to a list of completed tasks, it does allow you toclick and drag tasks from one heading (things to do) to another (completedtasks).andP;  Acta also makes it easy for you to reorganize the items in yourlist, and it offers extremely flexible options for printing.andM;Another option is the shareware DA To Do!andP;  2.0, written by Andrew Welch (ofDAtabase fame).andP;  This DA lets you enter up to 100 things to do and attachnotes, which can be viewed at the click of the mouse.andP;  Unfortunately, itdoesn't save a list of completed tasks -- it simply deletes them.andM;As for using a spare 128K Mac as a print server, it won't be much use withoutextensive upgrading.andP;  A more cost-effective solution is to add RAM to yourother Mac, which would let you use the Background Printing feature built into MultiFinder.andP;  Another inexpensive solution is SuperMac Technology'sSuperLaserSpool, a print spooler that works on each workstation Mac with anyof several different printers, including ImageWriters and LaserWriters.andM;Cabling NightmaresandM;Q.andP;  I have a Mac Plus and a Cirrus 70-megabyte hard-disk drive.andP;  Recently Ihave been looking for a 10-foot, 25/25 SCSI extension cable.andP;  My localauthorized Apple dealer had absolutely no idea what I was after.andP;  They toldme that the 25/25 cable was &quot;not standard&quot; and that they would check and getback to me (I have not heard a word since).andM;I went to the other authorized dealer in town.andP;  They sold me what wasreputedly a 10-foot, 25/25 SCSI cable.andP;  I took it home and connected it, butall I got was an icon requesting a startup disk.andP;  When I took it back, adifferent clerk sold me the same cable, swearing up and down that &quot;yes, itwould work.&quot;andP;  After I took it home, I encountered exactly the same problem.andM;I just want a 25/25, 10-foot SCSI cable.andP;  Not a fan belt for a Fokker.andP;  Whycan't I buy one? C. It Cambria, CAandM;A.andP;  About the only thing your Apple dealers appear to have done right istelling you that the cable you're looking for is nonstandard.andP;  It is.andO;According to Joel Kammerman at LaCie (manufacturer of the Cirrus drives), thecable you need is not only a 25/25, but it must also be a &quot;25/25straight-through.&quot;andP;  This means that pin 1 is connected to pin 1, pin 2 to pin2, and so on.andP;  The problem is that many dealers stock 25/25-pin cablesdesigned for other computers, most of which are not straight-through andcannot function as Macintosh SCSI cables.andM;Find a dealer or cable fabricator who understands the meaning of &quot;25/25straight-through,&quot; and you and your hard-disk drive will be up and running inno time.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
