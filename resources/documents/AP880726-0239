Negotiations in the presence of federal mediators adjourned forthe day without an accord, but a government official said he wouldnot characterize the talks as unproductive.   ``They're still talking,'' said Charles R. Barnes, executivedirector of the National Mediation Board. ``All I can really say isthat mediation is in progress and, as far as we're concerned, it'sgoing to go right down to the deadline. ... We'll be available aslong as we can help.''   While the two sides met behind closed doors at the board'sWashington offices, an Illinois congressman introduced legislationto push them closer to an agreement and block a threatened Aug. 4strike. Candamp;NW provides the principal daily rail service for about40,000 commuters in the Chicago area.   ``Although I dislike intervention by the federal government, wecannot stand idly by,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill. ``Congressmay act if they fail to do so.''   Porter's bill would require the company and union to accept asbinding the recommendations of a presidential emergency boardappointed to examine the dispute if the two sides fail to reachagreement on their own by the strike deadline.   At issue is a plan by Chicago andamp; North Western, a subsidiary ofCNW Corp., to cut costs by eliminating the jobs of 1,156 of its2,600 union brakemen.   Company spokeswoman Leslie Cleveland said the nation'seighth-largest rail carrier could save $51 million a year andbecome more competitive if it reduced the size of its train crewsfrom an engineer, conductor and two brakemen to only an engineerand conductor in most cases.   The company contends that improved technology has made the jobsobsolete. The union insists safety would be compromised without thebrakemen and said the cuts would violate its contract.   The outcome of the dispute could set a precedent for crew sizesthroughout the rail industry, which is entering national bargainingwith its unions this year.   A threatened UTU strike was averted in April when PresidentReagan, acting under provisions of the Railway Labor Act, appointedan emergency board to investigate the dispute. As part of hisorder, the union was prohibited from striking before 12:01 a.m. onAug. 4.   In a 29-page report to the president on July 1, the emergencyboard proposed doing away with 689 brakemen's jobs, cutting onebrakeman per train in most cases and both brakemen when approved byan arbitrator on a train-by-train basis.   ``Without such relief, (Candamp;NW) will be forced to take moredrastic economic action which could jeopardize the livelihood ofall its employees,'' the board said.   United Transportation Union Chairman Fred Hardin said the reportwas not acceptable.</TEXT></DOC>
