Here are the available figures on departures from Eastern Europeand explanations of the procedures in each country:   SOVIET UNION _ Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev rose to power in May1985 and embarked on a broad reform course, the Soviet Union has letincreasing numbers of citizens emigrate. In 1988, a record 108,000Soviets left for permanent resettlement abroad, mostly ethnicGermans, Armenians and Jews. This year authorities expect the figureto reach 200,000, compared to less than 1,000 per year in the early1980s. Soviets must submit to a lengthy and bureaucratic process togain permission to emigrate, but refusals are now reported to beless than 1 percent of applications.   EAST GERMANY _ Both legal emigration to West Germany andunauthorized flight to the West are up dramatically this year, asEast Germany witnesses the largest migration westward since theBerlin Wall was built in 1961. West Germany expects well over100,000 East Germans to arrive this year, both legal immigrants anda growing number of escapees fleeing through Hungary's newly openedborders.   East Germans get automatic citizenship in West Germany. Less than40,000 East Germans have been allowed to leave for the West in eachof the past 28 years, with the numbers dipping to below 1,000annually in the 1960s. The recent migration wave stems fromdissatisfaction among East Germans with their leadership's refusalto emulate the reforms sweeping Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.   POLAND _ Since passport laws were revised Jan. 1 to allowvirtually any citizen to travel abroad, the issue for Poles has notso much been getting permission to leave as getting visas to getinto other countries. Most emigres are ethnic Germans resettling inWest Germany, or those with close relatives in the United States wholeave to join them. More than 140,000 Poles of German originemigrated last year, and 3,500 left for the United States. U.S.visas will rise to 4,500 this year, while the exodus to West Germanyhas tapered off somewhat, though official figures are unavailable.Warsaw reported at the end of last year that during the 1980s, morethan 400,000 Poles failed to return from trips abroad.   HUNGARY _ Figures are not available for legal emigration fromHungary prior to liberalized travel codes adopted in January 1988,but the departures are thought to have been limited to a few hundredfamily reunification cases each year. Budapest officials have alsoacknowledged that an average of 2,500 to 3,000 Hungarians failed toreturn from authorized trips aboard each year during the 1980s,accounting for the majority of departures. Those desiring to leavenow are awaiting a new emigration law being drafted by the HungarianParliament. It is expected to result in a system similar to Poland'sin which anyone with a sponsor abroad will be allowed to leave.   CZECHOSLOVAKIA _ The last sizeable wave of emigres fromCzechoslovakia was in 1969, when 110,000 fled after the Warsaw Pactinvasion the previous year and before the borders were sealed.Czechoslovaks now can get to the West only to join spouses abroad,by failing to return from authorized foreign trips or in rarecircumstances when they are allowed to join close relatives abroad.   Unofficial sources say the number leaving, both legally andillegally, ranges between 6,000 and 8,000 per year.   ROMANIA _ In the most hard-line Warsaw Pact state, legalemigration is steady under fixed quotas while escapes have increasedas Romanians driven to despair chance dangerous departures toYugoslavia or Hungary. The West German government takes in about12,000 ethnic Germans freed from Romania each year. About 1,000 Jewsare allowed to go to Israel annually, and 2,000 to 3,000 otherdepartures are permitted, mostly to Canada, the United States andAustralia.   More than 20,000 Romanians of Hungarian descent have been givenrefuge in Hungary after fleeing illegally, and thousands more haveescaped to the West through Yugoslavia.   BULGARIA _ Emigration from Bulgaria consists primarily of ethnicTurks leaving for Turkey. Nearly 270,000 Turkish Bulgarians havefled or been expelled just since May, when Sofia began issuingpassports to those claiming repression under a forced assimilationcampaign that began in 1984.   Legal emigration and escapes over the years are thought to beonly a few hundred annually, and no official figures are available.</TEXT></DOC>
