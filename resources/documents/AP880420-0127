Last year, the company began giving away drugs for treatment ofhigh blood pressure and angina. Now Searle is adding five moredrugs to the free list.   Searle said it was taking the unusual step of giving itsproducts away because an estimated 37 million Americans ... have nohealth insurance.   Importantly, the company says the drugs will be available for aslong as a patient needs them, ... remarkable because treatment forhigh blood pressure and many heart problems is lifelong.   Every American deserves adequate health care, and Searle'sgenerosity is helping to make that possible.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 13   Austin (Minn.) Daily Herald on Larry Speakes and presidentialquotes:   Why would President Reagan allow a press secretary to put wordsin his mouth?   It's astonishing enough that former White House spokesman LarrySpeakes would attribute faked quotations to President Reagan. Buthow could Reagan let such a practice go on?   It should bother the American people that they have a leader whohas allowed words to be put in his mouth.   While some of the fabricated quotes may have turned out to befairly harmless, the appearance of a president unable or unwillingto respond himself could do grave harm to the United States in acrisis situation.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 18   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on fighting drug trafficking:   In a meaningless show of looking tough on drug trafficking, theSenate voted (April 14) to sanction Mexico for not doing enough tostop the flow of cocaine across its border into the United States.   But the senators, or at least 63 of them, didn't acknowledgethat the border has two sides, and that the United States issupposed to be looking after one of them.   Nor did they seem swayed by the reality that shutting offdrug-fighting money to a strapped nation would only strengthen thedrug lords. ...   Against great odds Mexico has begun cracking down on smugglingand corruption among officials responsible for enforcement. For apoor nation beset with a plethora of serious problems, such actionis especially heartening.   But here in the prosperous United States, where the drug marketis, there's been only token action. ...   If senators want to do something about drugs, the list ofsuitable actions is longer than the U.S.-Mexico border. Bashing ourneighbors for the sake of a headline won't make a dent in theproblem.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 15   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on Lyn Nofziger:   Lyn Nofziger, ... who has just been sentenced for untimelyinfluence peddling, is small potatoes as a law violator comparedwith Richard Nixon.   In his remarks to reporters after the sentencing, however, he... took a page from the Nixon book.   Not very long before the accumulated evidence of his wrongdoingforced Nixon to resign ... he earnestly assured the public: ``I amnot a crook.'' The Nofziger variation on this theme was: ``I am nota criminal.''   He was convicted on the strength of clear evidence. He violatedthe Ethics in Government Act by lobbying former administrationcolleagues ... much too soon after leaving the White House ...though the law stipulates a one-year waiting period.   Nofziger scorns this provision as ``a lousy law.'' It is in facta sound law aimed at protecting the public. ...   He plainly was guilty of violating that law, and deserves thesentence he got.</TEXT></DOC>
