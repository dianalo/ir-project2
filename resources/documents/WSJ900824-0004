Yesterday's 14.62 point loss brought the Nasdaq CompositeIndex to a level it hadn't seen since May 1988.</LP><TEXT>   One trader suggests the sell-off has become so prolongedand so pronounced that investors are selling at the closingbell in anticipation of lower prices at the next day'sopening bell.   Whatever the reason, traders' frustration at the absenceof supporting price levels or positive developments to rallythe market has become evident.   &quot;We're in very dangerous territory. Who knows how andwhere it's going to stop,&quot; says Philip Benizzi, head of OTCtrading for Dillion Read andamp; Co.   And Leslie Seff, director of OTC trading for Gruntal andamp;Co., says the best advice for now is to be on the sidelineswhile the world squares off against Iraq.   &quot;I see little change in direction until a positive changeoccurs in world affairs,&quot; Mr. Seff says.   While the Nasdaq Composite Index was dropping 3.9% to360.22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was falling 3% to2483.42, its first close below 2500 since July 1989. The NewYork Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 3.1%.   The OTC market started the day 2% lower at the opening and3.5% lower an hour later. By midday, unlisted stocks wererecovering, only to retreat quickly in the final 30 minutes.   This war-wary market seems to have abandoned oldpriorities, says Barry Berman, head of equity trading forRobert W. Baird andamp; Co.   &quot;Economic news, technical support levels just haven't madeany difference,&quot; Mr. Berman says.   The OTC's fifth straight loss was a broad one. Only 320issues advanced on the day while 2,163 declined.   Volume jumped to 202.8 million shares from Wednesday's146.1 million shares.   On the brighter side of a bleak OTC market, Dillon Read'sMr. Benizzi reports some of the added volume yesterday wasinstitutions selectively returning to the buy side of themarket.   Mr. Benizzi says corporations buying back their own issuesand other institutions shopping for a particular bargainhelped bring up some prices.   Intel benefitted from buy-back news and bargain hunting.   Twenty points below its 52-week high, Intel announced itsintent to repurchase up to 20 million of its 204 millioncommon shares. Intel shares got a 1 1/8 point boost to 331/4. Its volume of 4.5 million shares topped the OTCmost-active list.   Shorewood Packaging was 3 1/4 lower to 7 3/4 afterpredicting late Wednesday that its first quarter earningswould be about 30% below the 30 cents a share it earned inthe quarter a year ago. More than 2.6 million Shorewoodshares changed hands, nearly 12 times its daily averagevolume.   Among active stocks: MCI Communications was down 1 1/4 at31 3/4; Oracle Systems fell 5/8 to 12 3/4; Apple Computerlost 5/8 to 34 1/3; Nike closed 2 lower at 60; and Amgen was1 3/8 lower at 41 3/8.   McCaw Cellular Communications' debt problems werehighlighted in yesterday's &quot;Heard on the Street Column&quot; inthis newspaper. The column reported McCaw's $4 billion ofdebt has inspired a strong bearish sentiment about its stock.McCaw shares lost 2 to 15 3/4.   Elmwood Federal Savings Bank regained some lost ground,adding 1 to 7 1/2. Elmwood lost half of its value Wednesdaywhen Susquehanna Bancshares terminated its agreement topurchase Elmwood. Susquehanna shares fell 3/4 yesterday toclose at 17.
