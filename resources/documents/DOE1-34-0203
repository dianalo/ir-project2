An overviewof the software needs of the high-energy physics community and how modernlanguages can meet these needs is given. Using ADA as an example, theproduction of readable, efficient and maintainable code is shown to bedirectly supported by the language, integrating concepts such as top-downdesign, object-oriented programming and data encapsulation as a naturalpart of the language rather than as foreign ideas imposed on the language.Particular attention is paid to non-traditional aspects of a languageand how these can help by providing an integrated support environmentfor all phases of the lifetime of the software. 2 references.</TEXT></DOC>
