Moves Toward Becoming First State To Ban Assault Weapons</HEAD><BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bill that would make California thefirst state to ban assault weapons was approved by the Assembly, butbackers say they face a hurdle in reconciling the measure with onethat passed the Senate.   ``California has demonstrated that the political power of theNational Rifle Association can be resisted,'' state Attorney GeneralJohn Van de Kamp said after Monday's Assembly vote.   The measure, approved by 41-38, would virtually ban thepossession, sale and manufacture of more than 40 weapons, includingthe type of semiautomatic rifle used to kill five Stocktonelementary school children on Jan. 17.   Last Thursday, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a broaderproposal.   ``This is the first step in bringing some sort of sanity back toour communities,'' said Assemblyman Mike Roos, who wrote the bill.   But the Democratic lawmaker cautioned that supporters still faceproblems in getting a compromise bill to Gov. George Deukmejian. Theconservative Republican governor has indicated support for Roos'proposal but not the Senate's.   ``It's not down hill,'' Roos said. ``It's going to be vote byvote. Every time I change a line (in the bill's language) it's areason for people to drop off.''   Roos said he had lost some support for the bill during theweekend because of last-minute pressure from gun groups.   Pam Pryor, a spokeswoman for the NRA, acknowledged the bill'sbackers ``cleared a pretty big hurdle today,'' but she said hergroup would still fight the measures. ``Both of these things have along path to travel.''   The two bills were introduced in January after a derangeddrifter, Patrick Purdy, opened fire at a crowded Stocktonschoolyard, killing five young pupils and wounding 29 and a teacher.   Purdy sprayed more than 100 rounds with a semiautomatic versionof the AK-47, an assault rifle police say is becoming increasinglypopular with gangs, before killing himself.   Roos' bill started off identical to the one sponsored by Senateleader David Roberti, which includes a general definition of assaultweapons. But Roos' bill was restricted in committee to cover about36 models of rifles, eight types of pistols and three types ofshotguns.   The measure, with few exceptions, would bar the manufacture,import, sale, giving or lending of assault weapons after Jan. 1.   Violations could bring up to three years in prison and a $10,000fine. Use of the weapons in a felony could lead to an additionalfive-year prison term.   Adults who legally possessed the weapons before this Oct. 1 couldkeep them if they register them with the state. Anyone who wanted toobtain one legally after Sept. 30 and keep it after Jan. 1 wouldneed the same type of permit required for a machine gun, which isextremely difficult to obtain.   Roberti praised the Assembly and said he would seek agreements onamendments to the Senate version during the Easter recess.   But one opponent said the state really needs tougher criminallaws and programs to keep mentally ill people off the streets.   ``The problem is that Patrick Purdy was allowed on the streets atall,'' said Assemblyman Tom McClintock, referring to Purdy's historyof crime and mental problems. ``The problem is that Patrick Purdywas allowed near guns of any kind.''</TEXT></DOC>
