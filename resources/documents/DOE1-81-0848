The Indian Governmenthas begun a program to extinguish these fires and reclaim the damagedareas. One of these efforts, the Jogta fire project, is described inthis paper. The reclamation effort at Jogta consisted of: (1) excavatingthe subsidence cracks and filling them with impermeable material; (2)leveling, compacting, and sealing the entire surface to prepare it forthe use of heavy, rubber-tired equipment; (3) hauling in quarry refuseto establish a subsoil base with a slope of 5 to 10% to minimize erosionby rainfall; (4) hauling in topsoil to further seal the surface and providea medium for plant growth; (5) irrigating the area and planting withover 30 hardy species of vegetation; and (6) creating ponds to take advantageof the surface profile resulting from backfilling operations. These effortshave resulted in the reestablishment of pre-mining ecological conditions.The procedures, problems, and results of various aspects of the reclamationeffort are described.</TEXT></DOC>
