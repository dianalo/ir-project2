<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-07-0554 </DOCNO><TEXT>A Joint Task Force on Uranium Recycle Materials Processing was assembledby the Department of Energy (DOE) to study past and current practicesrelating to the processing of uranium recycle materials at DOE's FeedMaterials Production Center (FMPC), Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant, and the DOEoperations at the RMI Company. The DOE facilities providing the uraniumrecycle material and selected end users of the recycle material werereviewed in a cursory manner. The Task Force determined that uraniumrecycle material produced by the DOE reprocessing sites will always containtrace levels of transuranics (e.g., plutonium and neptunium) and fissionproduct (e.g., strontium and cesium) elements. However, the DOE processingsites such as the FMPC, Y-12 and RMI Company can safely handle and furtherprocess the recycle material if a clear understanding of the contaminantlevels exists and available technology is utilized to assure environmental,safety, and health protection of both the plant worker and the generalpublic. Irrespective of past practices, the Task Force judged that moreattention should be given to the processing of uranium recycle material.The primary recommendation from this study is to develop formal specificationson maximum permissible levels of contaminants in feed materials. 6 figs.,18 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
