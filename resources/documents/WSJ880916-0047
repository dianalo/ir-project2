Peoples shareholders would receive $20 per share. The thrift also granted Standard Federal options to purchase 729,000 shares of newly issued common stock.    The tentative agreement concludes a tumultuous year for Peoples. Last spring, two of the thrift's top officers resigned. In the summer, it reached an agreement with federal regulators to stop certain lending practices and to comply with accounting regulations.    Marvin Schoenhals, recently appointed president of Peoples, said yesterday that the sale wasn't precipitated by the events. He noted that, despite some problems, Peoples still has a strong net worth. Peoples has assets of $369 million with 12 offices in southeastern Michigan. Standard Federal is the second largest thrift in Michigan, with assets of $9.75 billion and 86 branches in Michigan and Indiana. </TEXT></DOC>
