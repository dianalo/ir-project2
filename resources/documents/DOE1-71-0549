Theinformation that results from this analysis may be of use in the nucleardebate, and may also help to establish the small scale of the risk fromcurrent uranium mining operations carried out with modern precautions,in contrast to the very different operating conditions that sometimesexisted in the early days of uranium mining. The risks of non-fatal accidentsare not included in this paper. United Kingdom and United States of Americadata, are presented on coal mining risks and productivity. Uranium riskdata have been obtained for Canadian, US, French, Australian and Namibianmines.</TEXT></DOC>
