The analysis, one of the first studies of its kind, found thatdrug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40percent higher rate of being fired, said researcher Jacques Normand.   Results suggest that by spending about $1.8 million a year toscreen job applicants for drugs, the post office could avoid about$3.1 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in thefirst year, he said. Over three years, the avoided costs wouldsurpass $17 million, he said.   For private employers, the study provides hard data showing thatdrug screening results are related to later job performance, hesaid.   Normand, a senior industrial psychologist at the U.S. PostalService in Washington, presented the study Sunday at the annualmeeting of the American Psychological Association.   Few well-designed studies have examined the cost to employers ofworker drug use, commented Steven Gust of the National Institute onDrug Abuse.   Estimates have relied mostly on anecdotal information instead,said Gust, who called Normand's work provocative.   Normand said the post office is phasing in drug testing as partof its evaluation of job applicants.   Results of the drug tests on people included in the study werenot revealed to personnel officials to ensure that the results didnot influence hiring decisions.   A total of 5,465 applicants at 21 hiring sites across thecountry were screened by urine test for use of amphetamines,barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, marijuana, methadone,opiates and phencyclidine.   The job performance analysis focused on the 4,220 applicants whowere hired and completed a standard 90-day probationary period. Ofthis group, 373 had tested positive for at least one drug.   Among those testing positive, 251 showed evidence of marijuanause only and 88 for cocaine use with or without marijuana. Theothers fell in other categories.   Absenteeism was calculated as the percentage of assigned workinghours that the employee was out sick, absent without pay or absentwithout official leave. The calculations were done after an averageof eight months on the job.   Workers who had tested positive for drug use were absent for anaverage of 4.2 percent of their assigned working hours, incomparison to 3 percent for the other workers in the study, Normandsaid.   The difference per employee is small, but it becomes moresignificant when applied to a large workforce, Gust of the druginstitute said.   Normand estimated that the greater absenteeism would cost thepost office $2.6 million in one year when applied to workers hiredthat year.   He also said the cost probably would increase as workers stay onthe payroll, because new workers are encouraged not to take leaveduring their probationary period.   The study also found 13 percent of positive-testing employeeshad been fired, compared to 9.5 percent of those who had testednegative.   Gust said the study does not address the question of whetherdrug use directly affects performance on the job. However, drugtest results may act as a proxy for some other behavioral orpersonality trait that affects job performance, he said.   The study is ``a marvelous take-off point'' for investigatingthat issue, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
