Everett Koop's declarationMonday that nicotine is addictive like heroin and cocaine promptedquick introduction of legislation to require new warnings oncigarette packages.   It also set off a groundswell of support from health andanti-smoking groups and a firestorm of protest from the tobaccoindustry.   Koop, at the start of a 618-page report that was no surprise toresearchers, said, ``Careful examination of the data makes it clearthat cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting. Anextensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug intobacco that causes addiction.   ``Moreover, the processes that determine tobacco addiction aresimilar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroinand cocaine,'' Koop wrote.   Those three sentences in the report's preface not only summed upthe document's essential conclusion, they tacticly acknowledgedthat the report was based more on a review of existing researchrather than on new scientific findings.   It was on that ground _ that the report did not represent newclinical research _ that the opponents based their main attack.   ``What I think we have to do and understand is to put it in itspolitical context,'' said Reggie Lester, a spokesman for theTobacco Growers Information Committee in North Carolina, the statethat produces 67 percent of the U.S. tobacco crop.   ``This is not a scientific report,'' he said. ``All this is acompilation of recent literature ... but they will be able to useit in a political context like they did with the report ... aboutenvironmental tobacco smoke.''   Lester referred to Koop's December 1986 report that concludednon-smokers' health was harmed by smoke from other people'scigarettes and gave impetus to widespread and still growing effortsto restrict cigarette smoking in the workplace and public areas.   Two weeks ago federal legislation went into effect banningsmoking on commercial airline flights of two hours or less duration.   ``This report and the surgeon general's findings should compelfederal and state authorities to treat tobacco as the addictivvedrug that it is,'' said Dr. Alan R. Nelson, chairman of the boardof trustees of the American Medical Association.   John Banzhaf, a George Washington University law professor whoalso heads the anti-smoking activist group called Action on Smokingand Health, predicted Koop's report would strengthen ``a key legalargument for plaintiffs in law suits in which cigarettemanufacturers argue that smokers should not be permitted to recoverdamages because they smoked of their own free will rather thanbecause of an addiction.''   The most direct call to action in Monday's report was for newcigarette warning labels saying nicotine is addictive.   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., introducted a bill that would add anew label to the four already alternating on cigarette packs. Itwould read: ``WARNING: Smoking is addictive. Once you start, youmay not be able to stop.''   Koop said he would like to see such a warning say nicotine is``just as addictive as heroin or cocaine.''   The surgeon general said he was under no illusion that tobaccowill ever be outlawed in the United States, but said: ``We need todo all we can to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids,banning vending machine sales, banning free samples, requiring alicense (to sell tobacco) and so forth. Forty-three of our statesdo have laws that should protect children, but they are very poorlyenforced, if at all. I think we need a license to sell tobacco justthe way we require one to sell alcohol.''   Asked if he was concerned that equating nicotine with addicting,illicit drugs might ``trivialize'' the much-publicized war ondrugs, Koop cited federal statistics that tobacco use results in anestimated 320,000 premature deaths per year in the United Statescompared with 125,000 for alcohol, 4,000 from alcohol incombination with other drugs, 4,000 from opioid (or heroin-likedrugs) and 2,000 from cocaine.   ``I don't see there's any way you could consider the (nicotine)problems that we have as trivializing other problems,'' he said.   Koop also was asked about whether his report might create moreantagonism between smokers and non-smokers.   ``I think it would mean in general more sympathy for the personwho can't quit,'' he said. ``You might get annoyed at people whosmoke in your presense and make your eyes burn and your sinusesclog up and so forth, but your anger has to be abated by the factthat these people are addicted to a drug and I think this will makepeople more tolerant of the problems a smoker faces when he istrying to quit.''   The Tobacco Institute said ``Smoking is truly a personal choicewhich can be stopped if and when a person decides to do so. Thesurgeon general's own Public Health Service figures indicate thatabout 40 million Americans are former smokers and that 95 percentof them quit smoking without help. These figures, and common sense,contradict any claim that smoking is an `addiction.'''</TEXT></DOC>
