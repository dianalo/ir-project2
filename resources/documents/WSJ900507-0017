The U.S.'s largest retailer appointed Dorrit Bern, one ofthe first departmentstore managers recruited as part of thecurrent drive to update stores, to the new post of nationalmerchandise manager of women's ready-to-wear apparel. Theselection greatly expands Ms. Bern's responsibilities byadding the big sportswear category. She had been nationalmerchandise manager for women's dresses, coats and juniorapparel.</LP><TEXT>   The announcement followed the appointments of two otheroutsiders as top managers of Sears women's merchandisecategories. Only one women's merchandise category, intimateapparel and hosiery, is still overseen by a company veteran.   The personnel moves amount to an admission by Sears thatit desperately needs to revamp its women's business -- andthat its mostly inbred managers aren't up to the task ontheir own. &quot;The important thing is Sears is looking for thebest people,&quot; said Michael Bozic, chairman and chiefexecutive officer of the Sears merchandise group. He addedthat Sears's strengths &quot;sometimes are more visible tocompetitors and people on the outside than they are to us.&quot;   The stakes are high. &quot;If Sears can't figure out how tosell women clothes, it is going to be very limited in itsability to grow,&quot; said George Rosenbaum, president of Leo J.Shapiro andamp; Associates, a market research firm. Women surveyedin the fall by Shapiro andamp; Associates were significantly moreconfident of finding what they wanted at J.C. Penney Co.stores than at Sears, Mr. Rosenbaum said.   Mr. Bozic said the company's latest image survey indicatedsome improvement in the way women view Sears, probably theresult of its efforts to add national labels to what had beenmostly a private-label lineup. He declined to say how muchthe favorable feelings had risen.   Still, Mr. Bozic isn't satisfied with the currentperformance. He said he expects the new women's organizationto produce double-digit sales increases in the second half ofthe year, which includes the important Christmas season.Store sales of women's apparel last year accounted for lessthan 10% of the company's merchandise group revenue of $31.6billion.   The 40-year-old Ms. Bern already has a track record atSears, where she is credited with reviving the once-moribundteenagers' and young women's business known as juniors. Afterjumping to Sears in 1987 from the Bon Marche department storechain in Seattle, Ms. Bern recruited department-store buyersto develop new Mainframe departments, stocked mostly withnational labels. Sears says the departments, which featureharem pants and other trendy styles, are a success.   This past year, Sears rewarded Ms. Bern by adding dressesand coats to her responsibilities. She has recruited buyersfrom department stores in these areas too. And Mr. Bozic saiddress sales are &quot;exploding now&quot; from what he acknowledged wasa small base.   The women's sportswear business was formerly run by JoeSilvestri, a Sears veteran, who is moving into the topmarketing job in the women's business unit, Mr. Bozic said.   Heading the other three women's merchandise categories atSears are:   -- John Guze, who joined Sears in April as general managerof footwear, luggage and women's accessories. The 44-year-oldMr. Guze, who had been a divisional merchandise manager atDayton Hudson Corp.'s department store unit in Minneapolis,holds the title of general manager because he is responsiblefor both buying and selling operations.   -- Kenneth Cort, general manager of the fine jewelrybusiness since last year. The 47-year-old Mr. Cort formerlywas chairman and chief executive of Zale Jewelry.   -- Janice Page, a 41-year-old Sears veteran, remains inher post as national merchandise manager for intimate appareland hosiery.</TEXT></DOC>
