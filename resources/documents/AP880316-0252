The charges were announced by Lawrence E. Walsh, the independentcounsel whose investigation began about the same time thatcommittees of both the House and Senate began looking at the secretsale of U.S. weapons to Iran and the diversion of some of the moneyto the Nicaraguan Contras.   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senatecommittee, said he believes that ``justice will ultimately bedone.''   Inouye added that ``I personally remain convinced that they (thefour men) exhibited insufficient sensitivity to the rule of law,and to the fact that under our system of government the Congressmust make the laws,'' but he said, ``we must await the verdict of ajury of their peers as to whether this insensitivity was criminalin nature.''   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contracommittee, noted that the indictments closely paralleled theconclusions of the congressional committees, although the panelsmade no attempt to assess criminal blame.   ``I don't think there are any major surprises,'' he said,although ``there was more of an emphasis on the misuse of federalfunds ... than I might have anticipated.''   ``They are very serious charges, obviously, and quiteextensive,'' Hamilton told reporters. ``They cover a lot ofmisconduct.'' He added that Walsh probably developed moreinformation than the committees were able to get on financialrecords.   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, another member of the Senatepanel, said, ``it is a serious matter when any citizen is chargedwith a crime, and it is even more serious when a former highgovernment official, and close adviser to the president, ischarged.''   Mitchell said ``no one should prejudge the case,'' but said hehad heard nothing in the indictments which had not come out duringlast summer's Iran-Contra hearings.   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, another member of the Senate panel,was one of the administration's strongest supporters during thecongressional hearings and he was critical of the indictments.   The investigation was ``a colossal embarrassment to our wholegovernment,'' Hatch told a news conference. ``It's going to be avery tricky trial to try to prove these charges in an open forum.''   ``I'm not white-washing this. There were serious mistakes madehere,'' Hatch said.   ``You may very well be able to get convictions undertechnicalities of the law,'' he said, speaking of the indictments,but ``these indictments are choking on the nits of the law.''   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a member of the House investigatingcommittee and another strong administration supporter, said,``these indictments aren't any surprise. But this is only thebeginning of what will be a very long legal process that willquestion the sufficiency of the indictments and theconstitutionality of the laws.''   For example, he said, ``I believe the indictments are premisedon some assumptions that may or may not be true, like title to themoney. The prosecutors believe the money from the sale of weaponsto Iran belonged to the U.S. Treasury and therefore it wasmisappropriated for the Contras, but I think a very good argumentcan be made that the proceeds of the sale don't belong to theTreasury.''   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a candiate for the Democraticpresidential nomination, said, ``whatever the outcome of theseprosecutions, I think the special prosecutor has given us freshevidence that the Reagan administration generally has put theConstitution of the United States through the shredder.''   ``This will be an important issue in the campaign,'' Gephardtsaid, particularly the role of Vice President George Bush, who isthe front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.   Jesse Jackson, another presidential candidate, said theindictments were ``a source of embarrassment to this administrationand a disgrace to our country,'' but called those indicted ``thefall guys.''   ``They were, in fact, implementing this administration'spolicy,'' he said.   Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, the fired White House aide who was oneof the four men charged, was supported Wednesday by Andy Messing,head of the National Defense Council, a private, conservativeorganization. Messing is a friend of North.   ``It's a difference between persecution and prosecution thatWalsh is going to have to explain to the American people,'' Messingsaid. ``After 15 months and $10 million and almost 300 people athis disposal, Judge Walsh is going to have to convince the Americanpeople that is not persecution but a prosecution.''   Robert Grant, president of another group that supports North,the American Freedom Coalition, issued a statement calling on thepresident to pardon North.   ``Col. North is a man of principle, honor and commitment. Hispatriotic, pro-American values are a tremendous asset to thewell-being of the United States,'' Grant said.   ``This is hardly the definition of a criminal,'' Grant said.``He should be pardoned immediately.''</TEXT></DOC>
