The service would allow international money traders to execute trades from the keyboard of a terminal, a Telerate spokesman said. Currently, traders get information about prices on their screens, then execute transactions by phone. Telerate said the service eventually will be extended to other financial instruments on which it provides price information, such as mortgage-backed securities, metals and futures.    An ATandamp;T executive said he couldn't say when the service will be commercially available. Telerate said it has issued requests for proposals for the terminals and for development of software for the terminals, which would initially be personal computers compatible with those made by International Business Machines Corp. Several New York banks are expected to see a demonstration of the proposed system tonight at a New York hotel, Telerate said. Telerate is 56%-owned by Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.    Peter B. Yunich, a former executive director of ATandamp;T who was named chief executive officer of the venture, said it will be equally funded by both companies, but he declined to say how much money has been committed. ATandamp;T plans to design a global data network for the system, although some currently available public services may be used. &quot;This is a dedicated data network deployed on a global basis,&quot; Mr. Yunich said. &quot;It isn't a small undertaking.&quot;    The Telerate spokesman said the companies envision their system to be more functional than that currently offered by British-based Reuters. Traders will be able to execute four trades at once, for instance, he said. Telerate will market and sell the system as well as provide price information, while ATandamp;T will design the transaction network, Telerate said.    The venture represents another attempt by ATandamp;T to provide specialized services for the financial-services industry. Until last year, ATandamp;T had a venture with Quotron Systems Inc. to develop a new financial-information system that would have used ATandamp;T workstations.    That venture fell apart when Citicorp bought Quotron last year. ATandamp;T was prevented from making a competing bid to acquire Quotron, which provides stock prices and other financial information, because the consent decree that broke up the Bell System prevents ATandamp;T from entering the electronic-publishing business until August 1989.    Mr. Yunich said ATandamp;T believes that the Telerate venture doesn't require court approval because ATandamp;T isn't disseminating Telerate's price information. ATandamp;T is only designing a system that lets traders use the information to more efficiently execute trades. &quot;Obviously, as you know with ATandamp;T, we've had the appropriate battery of attorneys working on this, and we see no regulatory prohibitions,&quot; Mr. Yunich said. </TEXT></DOC>
