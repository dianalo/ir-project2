At the meeting, Arthur Dunkel,director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, urged nations to exercise &quot;self-restraint anddiscipline&quot; in seeking changes, to keep the talks fromfalling apart.                                                                                                          EC negotiators told a GATT assembly that they wanted&quot;significant improvements&quot; in the agricultural portions of atext that Mr. Dunkel had submitted last month, which he hadhoped would serve as the basis of a settlement. Japan, SouthKorea, Mexico, Austria, Switzerland, Israel and some Nordiccountries also asked for changes similar to those sought bythe EC.   Asking for &quot;improvements,&quot; the U.S. official said, is adiplomatic way of asking for substantial weakening of Mr.Dunkel's agricultural proposal, which would cut agriculturalexport subsidies 36% over six years and domestic subsidies20% over the same period. The EC didn't ask for any specificchanges at the meeting, but is expected to disclose them toMr. Dunkel over the next few days.   EC negotiators couldn't be reached for comment. But anegotiator from an Asian country, who asked not to be named,called the overall tone of the EC presentation &quot;positive.&quot;   Rufus Yerxa, the U.S. GATT negotiator, told the meetingthat the Dunkel proposal contained the &quot;basic ingredients&quot;for a final settlement on a new GATT agreement that wouldvastly strengthen the organization's powers and reduce tradebarriers in a host of industries. Any changes, he said,should move in the direction of &quot;greater marketliberalization.&quot;   Large farm producers -- including Australia, Brazil,Argentina, Chile -- backed the Dunkel proposal, as did HongKong, the officials said.   Meanwhile, President Bush said any GATT accord would haveto include favorable provisions for U.S. farmers before hewould send it to Congress for approval. U.S. farmers &quot;havebeen pounded out there by unfair EC subsidies, and we're notgoing to have some sort of unilateral deal that is naive inthe face of unfair world competition,&quot; he told a meeting ofthe American Farm Bureau in Kansas City, Mo.   Numerous agricultural groups in the U.S., especially thoserepresenting sugar, peanut, cotton and dairy farmers, opposethe Dunkel proposal, because it would raise quotas that keepout foreign competition.   Mr. Dunkel told the 108-nation GATT assembly that he wouldoversee talks concerning adjustments, said an official whoparticipated in the talks. But Mr. Dunkel said changes shouldbe made only if they were agreeable to all parties and didn'tunravel his full proposal. At the same time, talks aimed atreducing tariffs and opening markets to agricultural productsand service industries would continue under differentnegotiators.   A U.S. official said the &quot;overall impression is that itwill be very difficult to rapidly conclude&quot; negotiations.That bodes poorly for the U.S., which feels pressed by thecoming presidential and congressional elections -- as well asgrowing protectionist sentiment at home -- to reach anagreement by early spring.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
