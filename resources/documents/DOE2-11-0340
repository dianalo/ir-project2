<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-0340 </DOCNO><TEXT>(1) Drilling fluid technique - proper type of fluid should be selectedaccording to the geological condition in drilling the well. As water-basedmud dispersion and mud polymer are usually used for the thermal drilling,this report describes on their general properties and on the high temperaturemud water. Measures for escaping water and the enhancement of the drillingrate are aimed, and pneumatic drilling and air-mud mixture drilling aredescribed. (2) Inclined drilling technique - Recent domestic trend inthe thermal wells is the inclined drilling. As the drilling cost occupiesmuch of the total thermal development cost, the recent inclined drillingtechnique is introduced costwise. (3) Well completion technique - Introductionof present status and the future perspective are described on the casingcementing, hydraulic crushing, and the acid treatment, etc..
