Laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments in arice paddy were carried out to determine the behaviour and fate of theimportant systemic insecticide carbofuran after application of new formulations.The release rates into water and the residues in the plant and soil weredetermined. Metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Carbon-14 labelled carbofuran was used for the experiments. The resultsshowed that the cellulose based (hydroxyethyl-cellulose) formulationsreleased the active ingredient carbofuran at a significantly slower ratethan commercial formulations, but that the concentration of carbofuranin water and plants was high enough to protect the plants against insects.Recovery of the insecticide in the rice paddy was only about 30%. Mostwas lost by changing the water in the paddy field, according to the usualcultivation practice, and by possible evaporation. The radioactivityfound in grain and straw was 0.03% and 0.2%, respectively. The distributionof carbofuran in soil at different layers was: 0-5 cm: 17%; 5-15 cm:7%; 15-25 cm: 4%; 25-40 cm: 2%. Less than 10% of the total radioactivitycould be extracted from plants (Soxhlet extraction); thus, most of thecarbofuran was metabolized and bound to the plant-grain constituents.(author). 4 refs, 5 figs, 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
