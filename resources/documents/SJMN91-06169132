Clark, one of the largest American militarybases outside the United States, is 10 miles east of the volcano and has beenshut down since last Monday.;    Sunday's expanded evacuation order includesall civilian workers at Clark and at Subic Bay, as well as all dependents fromboth installations.;    &quot;The only ones left will be uniformed Army, Air Force,Navy or Marine personnel,&quot; said Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, a spokesman at Subic.&quot;You'll have to be in uniform to stay.&quot;;    Workers to remain at Subic;   Military officials said that about 12,000 uniformed military workers werestationed at the bases before the volcano erupted, and that most would remainbehind at Subic while their families and the civilian employees left thePhilippines.;    Virtually all of the 16,000 base workers at Clark and theirfamily members were evacuated to Subic Bay last week.;    The chief spokesmanat the U.S. Embassy in Manila, Stanley Schrager, said the evacuation had beenordered because &quot;it's just untenable to have 30,000 people at Subic, doublethe ordinary population, especially given the uncertainty over the volcano andover the future of Clark as to when these people would be able to go home.&quot;;   On Sunday, Clark looked like a vast moonscape, with about six inches ofconcrete-like volcanic ash covering roads, roofs and runways. Ragged scrublandand manicured lawns had the same bleak blanket of hard gray crust.;    'Awasteland';    &quot;Everything looks like a wasteland,&quot; said Philippine Brig. Gen.Leopoldo Acot Jr., commander of about 150 Philippine troops guarding thenearly deserted base.;    On Saturday, volcanic ash and a hail of inch-longpebbles emitted by Mount Pinatubo shut down operations at Subic Bay anddamaged about 100 buildings, half of them seriously.;    Two people -- a9-year-old American girl and a Filipino -- were reported killed late Saturdaywhen the roof of their shelter at Subic collapsed under the weight of theash.;    &quot;We don't have snow here, and the roofs are not designed to holdanything,&quot; Mukri said. &quot;You get an event like this only about every 600 years.It's not something you plan for.&quot;;    In the city of Olongapo, near the Subicbase, eight people were reported killed when the roof of a hospital collapsedlate Saturday because of ash deposits. Six people died when a church collapsedin Dau, near Clark.;    Readiness unaffected;    U.S. officials said theevacuation of base workers from Clark and Subic would not affect militaryreadiness in the Pacific. All jet fighters had been withdrawn from Clark inrecent months as a result of a global redeployment of forces by the Pentagon.;   But the volcano is expected to affect the final round of negotiationsbetween the United States and the Philippines over an extension of the jointlease for the two bases, which expires in September. U.S. officials say Clarkmay not be able to assume normal operations for months, if not years.;   There appears to be no similar doubt about the future of Subic, which couldreopen fully within the next few weeks.;    Philippine scientists said Sundayit appeared that a section of the crater on Mount Pinatubo had collapsed onitself, releasing pressure that might otherwise have produced a cataclysmicavalanche of molten rock.;    Forecast withdrawn;  On Saturday, the PhilippineInstitute of Volcanology and Seismology had predicted such an explosion afterobtaining satellite photos showing a nearly two-mile fissure along thesouthern edge on the volcano. But Sunday it withdrew the ominous forecast.;   The evacuation from Subic began Sunday afternoon, when 900 Americans, mostlywives and children from Clark, boarded the cruiser Arkansas and two frigates,the Rodney M. Davies and the Kurtz, bound for Cebu.;    Military officialssaid the evacuees would probably be flown by chartered jets from theinternational airport at Cebu to an American air base on Guam, and, fromthere, to the United States. Plans to evacuate the Americans by plane from theCubi Point naval air station, which adjoins Subic Bay, were foiled by theash.;    The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, leading a battle group outof Okinawa on the way to the Persian Gulf, is to assist in the evacuation,which is expected to last a week to 10 days, U.S. officials said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Manila, Philippines  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910617  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,052  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday June 17, 199100169132,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
