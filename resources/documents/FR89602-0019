Background</ITAG>Congress amended the Contract Work Hours Standards Act (CWHSA) [40 U.S.C.327 et seq.] in 1969 by adding a new section 107 (40 U.S.C. 333) to provideemployees in the construction industry with a safer work environment andto reduce the frequency and severity of construction accidents and injuries.The amendment, commonly known as the Construction Safety Act [Pub. L. 91-54;August 9, 1969], significantly strengthened employee protection by providingfor occupational safety and health standards for employees of the buildingtrades and construction industry in Federal and Federally-financed or Federally-assistedconstruction projects.The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act), [29 U.S.C.651 et seq.] authorized the Secretary of Labor to adopt established Federalstandards issued under other statutes, including the Construction SafetyAct, as occupational safety and health standards under the OSH Act. Accordingly,the Secretary adopted the construction standards which were issued underthe Construction Safety Act in 29 CFR Part 1518 as OSHA standards on May29, 1971 (36 FR 10466) and redesignated these rules as 29 CFR Part 1926,on December 30, 1971 (36 FR 25232). The standard entitled ``Tunnels andShafts,'' andSection; 1926.800, was adopted as an OSHA standard in SubpartS of Part 1926 as part of this process. Section 1926.800 protects undergroundconstruction workers from hazards such as cave-ins, contaminated atmospheres,fires and explosions, haulage and hoisting operations, and floods.In 1971, two major tunnel disasters, in Sylmar, California, and in PortHuron, Michigan, prompted the Assistant Secretary of Labor for OccupationalSafety and Health to ask the Agency's construction safety standards staffand the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH) (establishedunder section 107 of the Construction Safety Act and section 7(b) of theOSH Act) to study the existing rules and to recommend any necessary changes.The ACCSH formed a subcommittee on tunnels, which met on January 31, 1972,February 8 and 22, 1972, and on November 1, 20, and 21, 1972. The fullACCSH met on August 30, 1972, December 14, 1972, June 19, 1973, and July25, 1973. The ACCSH submitted its recommendations to the Secretary of Laboron July 25, 1973 (Ex. 1:15).On the basis of the ACCSH's findings, OSHA proposed revisions to the tunnelingregulations on March 18, 1974 (39 FR 10216). A public hearing on the 1974proposal was held in Washington, DC, on June 26, 1974. The testimony andcomments received in connection with this hearing have been entered intothe record of the present rulemaking (Ex. 1:19-28). Based on these commentsand changes in the industry, OSHA decided to withdraw the 1974 proposaland to publish a revised proposed rule.OSHA issued a new proposal to revise 29 CFR 1926.800 on August 5, 1983(48 FR 35774). Prior to that date, the ACCSH reviewed and made recommendationson several drafts of the revised proposal at several meetings (Ex. 2-5).At those meetings, the Committee consistently urged OSHA to initiate rulemakingon a new proposal (Ex. 2, pp. 136-138; Ex. 3, p. 134; Ex. 4, pp. 8-124).The transcript of the ACCSH's deliberations on the various drafts has beenentered into the record (Ex. 1, 4, 7, and 8 [Ex. 1 includes the ACCSH'stranscripts prior to March 18, 1974]). The Committee's comments, and thoseof other interested parties, have been carefully analyzed in connectionwith the proposed and final rulemakings. Many of the changes in the standardproposed in 1983 reflect the Committee's recommendations and suggestions.Relevant ACCSH comments and recommendations were discussed in the Summaryand Explanation section of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.Comments on the 1983 proposal were received from 52 sources including individuals,businesses, labor unions, state governments, federal agencies, and tradeassociations. An informal public rulemaking hearing was held on March 13-15,1984, to examine pertinent issues including those specified in a noticepublished on December 19, 1983 (48 FR 56087). Following the hearing, AdministrativeLaw Judge Charles P. Rippey allowed 60 days for the submission of post-hearingcomments and 30 days for the submission of argument and briefs. Judge Rippeycertified the 800-page hearing transcript and all related submissions toOSHA and officially closed the record on October 24, 1984.After the close of the record, OSHA received new relevant data developedby a contractor, JRB Associates/ Science Applications International Corporation(JRB/SAIC). The new information affected costs attributable to undergroundconstruction activities which would be classified as ``gassy'' or ``potentiallygassy.'' The contractor also provided estimates related to the cost ofproviding permissible ventilation systems, with and without reversiblecontrols at the surface. OSHA decided to place the data into the record(Exhibit andplusmin;54), to invite the public to review it, and to permitthe submission of written comments on the contractor's report. Accordingly,OSHA reopened the record for this limited purpose for 60 days (50 FR 33357,August 19, 1985). Copies of the report were sent to those who had participatedat the hearing. OSHA received no comments challenging the contents andconclusions reported in the JRB/SAIC study. OSHA appreciates the contribution of the parties who assisted in assemblingthe record during this rulemaking. OSHA has developed this Final Rule basedon a full consideration of the entire record of this proceeding, includingthe materials discussed or relied on in the proposal, the record of thehearing, and all written comments and exhibits received.Accidents resulting in injuries and fatalities continue to occur duringunderground construction operations despite the promulgation of the OSHAConstruction Standards in 1971. An in-depth discussion of the hazards appearedin the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on August 5, 1983 (48 FR35774). OSHA has determined that these hazards pose a significant riskto the underground construction industry and that the requirements containedin this revision of 29 CFR 1926.800 are reasonably necessary to protectagainst that risk. For a further discussion of significance of risk, seeSection III, Summary of the Regulatory Impact and Regulatory FlexibilityAssessment.In accordance with section 6(b)(8), 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8), of the OSH Act,OSHA has reviewed various national consensus standards, such as ANSI A10.16-1981,Safety Requirements for Construction of Tunnels, Shafts, and Caissons;ANSI/NFPA 58-1986, Storage and Handling of Liquified Petroleum Gases; andANSI/NFPA 495-1985, Manufacture, Transportation, Storage, and Use of ExplosiveMaterials, that cover working conditions addressed in this Final Rule.Where appropriate, OSHA has incorporated provisions from those nationalconsensus standards as part of the Final Rule. OSHA believes that the finalstandard will better effectuate the purposes of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act of 1970 than the national consensus standards which havenot been made a part of this Final Rule, because this Final Rule is morecomprehensive and provides greater flexibility in its requirements forsafety.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule</ITAG>In light of the testimony at the public hearing and the written comments,OSHA has modified aspects of the 1983 proposal. The following table liststhose portions of the proposal that remain unchanged or those that havebeen revised only editorially, not substantively. The reasons supportingthe Final Rule, including any significant modifications of the 1983 proposal,are discussed below and in the narrative accompanying the proposal (48FR 35777-35809).<ITAG

passageways, and cut-and-coverexcavations which have been covered sufficiently to present the undergroundconstruction hazards addressed in the standard. It should be noted thatthe current standard has been applied to certain cut-and-cover excavationssince 1976. Since 1979, it has applied to any phase of cut-and-cover operationsbeing conducted during and as part of the construction of tunnels whichalso have been covered so as to create conditions in which hazards characteristicof tunnel operations are present (See OSHA Instruction STD 3.11, Dec. 10,1979) (Ex. 15-5). In the Final Rule, paragraph (a)(1) remains as proposedexcept that, as a result of several comments, the reference to cut-and-coverexcavations has been modified.A number of commenters questioned the application of the revised standardto cut-and-cover operations (Exs. 17-12, 17-13, 17-24, 17-31, 17-37, 17-38,17-45, and 21-13). For example, Kenny Construction Company asserted thatthere is no consensus on the degree of cover of an excavation that willcorrelate to the hazards addressed in andSection; 1926.800, and that individualjudgments will vary as to when hazards characteristic of tunnel operationsare present (Ex. 17-31). Mr. Frederick F. Foote, a construction safetyconsultant, commented that the phrase ``sufficiently covered to presentunderground construction hazards'' leaves too much to the subjective judgmentof OSHA compliance officers (Ex. 17-12).OSHA was also urged to develop a separate standard for cut-and-cover operations(Ex. 17-13). However, the cut-and-cover proposal was strongly endorsedby the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. JosephL. Durst, Jr., Director of the Union's Health and Safety Department, characterizedthe inclusion of cut-and-covered excavations as ``one of the most improvedelements of this proposal'' and stated that it filled a void between thecurrent underground construction standard and the excavation standardsat 29 CFR 1926.652 and 1926.655 (March 1984 Hearing Transcript at pp. 766-768).In the Final Rule, OSHA has revised the application of the standard tocut-and-cover excavations by stating that if the excavation is coveredso as to create conditions chracteristic of underground construction andthe excavation is also physically connected to other ongoing undergroundconstruction operations which are within the scope of this section, thenthe cut-and-cover excavation is also within the scope. For example, a cut-and-coversubway station that has active tunneling operations at either end of itwould be within the scope of this standard because the excavation occurringduring these other tunneling operations creates the hazards and the coverover the excavation contains them, thereby creating conditions within thecut-and-covered portion similar to an actual tunnel. OSHA believes thatthis more clearly expresses the regulatory intent without substantivelyaltering the scope of the current standard. Although OSHA recognizes thathazards may differ in degree from one worksite to another, the Agency cannotexplicitly anticipate every unique circumstance in fashioning safety andhealth standards for general application to underground construction. Inthe last ten years, OSHA has found that the application of andSection; 1926.800to certain cut-and-cover operations is generally well understood by theindustry as well as by OSHA compliance officers. The record in this proceedingdoes not demonstrate a need for a separate cut-and-cover standard. Accordingly,OSHA will continue to apply the underground construction standard to cut-and-coveroperations.OSHA emphasizes that the scope of this Final Rule remains consistent withthe overall philosophy expressed in the Preamble to the proposal (48 FR35777-78), that this standard should apply to the construction of any undergroundfacility or to any underground operation that is physically connected totunneling operations so as to present hazards typical of tunnel construction.Although OSHA stated (48 FR 35778) that certain pipejacking and manholeconstruction operations would be covered by this standard, it appears thatthis point needs further clarification. For example, one commenter assertedthat pipeline and manhole work does not involve all of the same conditionsas tunnel work, and recommended that OSHA use the criteria of a passagewayexcavated by employees and equipment working below the earth's surfacein determining the scope of this standard (Ex. 17-24).OSHA intends that andSection; 1926.800 protect employees working in bothpre-existing manholes and manholes under construction if the manhole isboth physically connected to an active underground construction operationand also covered to such an extent that the manhole presents the undergroundconstruction hazards addressed in this section.OSHA also intends to apply these rules to certain pipejacking operations,based on the location of the employees performing the work. For example,if an employee is working underground, then this section applies, regardlessof whether the ground support is advanced by pushing pipe or is fabricatedwithin the heading. However, if an employee is working outside of the portalin an open pit (for example, operating horizontal boring and pipejackingequipment) and is not exposed to underground construction hazards, thenthis section does not apply. (That type of an operation is more appropriatelycovered by other OSHA construction standards, including Excavations (andSection;1926.650-652) and Confined Spaces (andSection; 1926.21(b)(6).)Paragraph (a)(2) explains that andSection; 1926.800 does not apply to foundationoperations for above-ground structures that are not physically connectedto an underground construction operation, or to surface excavation, asboth are addressed in Subpart P (Excavations) of this Part; or to undergroundelectrical transmission and distribution lines, as addressed in SubpartV (Power Transmission and Distribution) of this Part.OSHA specifically solicited comments on whether other types of constructionshould be exempted from the scope of this section (48 FR 35778). ATandamp;T(Ex. 17-5) recommended that telecommunications manholes specifically beexempted, contending that the construction of manholes is more appropriatelycovered under Subpart P. OSHA agrees that the construction of such manholeswould be covered by Subpart P, and not by andSection; 1926.800, if such manholesare not physically connected to an underground construction operation.However, it should be noted that once a manhole is physically connectedto an underground construction job, OSHA believes that an employee withinthe manhole who is exposed to hazards typical of underground constructionshould be afforded the same protections that andSection; 1926.800 provides.OSHA received comments that foundation operations such as underpinningand drilled-pier shafts should be included within the scope of this standard,rather than excluded (see, for example, Exs. 17-2 and 17-36). OSHA hasconsidered the hazards cited by these comments (for example, workers whodescend into a large machine-drilled shaft for cleanup or geotechnicalinspection and are exposed to confined spaces, moving ground, and bad air)and has decided that these hazards will be covered by Subpart P, andSection;1926.55(Gases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists), andSection;1926.57 (Ventilation),and the confined spaces requirements of andSection;1926.21(b)(6). It shouldalso be noted that Subpart P is currently being revised (see 52 FR 12288)and that revision will address bell-bottom pier holes and other similarfooting excavations. In addition, the revision will address cave-in protection,air-monitoring, and other hazards for these types of excavations. Several commenters recommended the development of a confined spaces standardto cover certain operations_such as work performed by small crews and unspecifiedsizes of sewer jobs (Exs. 17-4, 17-6, 17-9, 17-13, 17-22, 17-29, 17-51).For example, Mr. Edward Bovee, with Underground Construction Company, Inc.,(Ex. 17-37) stated that a three-man crew working on a sewer manhole connectedto a sewer main is adequately covered in the California confined spacestandard. In response, it must first be noted that under this Final Rule,manhole work on an existing sewer is beyond the scope of this standard.However, for operations within the scope of this standard, OSHA does notagree that employees should be excluded from the additional protectionsafforded by andSection;1926.800 simply because a crew is composed of onlythree employees. A number of comments (Exs. 17-6, 17-13, 17-24, 17-31, 21-13) questionedthe necessity of such proposed requirements as two 5-person rescue crews,a formal check-in/check-out system, and a nine-point safety program, includingflood control, in connection with activities such as constructing manholesconnected to sewer systems, setting a concrete box culvert or steel pipein an open-cut operation, or jacking an open-ended pipe beneath a highway.OSHA has addressed these comments generally by clarifying (see below) whenmanhole construction and pipe-jacking operations are to be considered withinthe scope of this standard, and also by revising the provisions concerningrescue crews, safety programs, and check-in/check-out systems to reflectthe size or extent of the job. Paragraph (b) Access and Egress OSHA proposed, at paragraph (b)(1), a general requirement written in performancelanguage for safe means of access to and egress from all work stations.OSHA explained that this proposed revision was editorial in nature, inthat it clarified the existing standard, at andSection;1926.800(a)(2), byadding the word ``egress,'' but without further change (see 48 FR 35778).Although OSHA was unaware of any confusion attributable to the performancelanguage in the current standard, OSHA solicited comments on the appropriatenessof including more detailed access/egress provisions such as those foundin the ANSI and Michigan tunneling standards (see 48 FR 35779). The recorddoes not, however, indicate a need for more detailed provisions, so thecurrent standard, with editorial revision, is retained in this Final Rule.OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (b)(2) to specify the hazard to whichthe standard is intended to apply (see 48 FR 35779). The proposal simplyrequired the employer to provide ``protection'' for employees walking inareas where mobile equipment is present. The Final Rule clarifies thatthe hazard contemplated by the standard is being ``struck by'' such equipment.OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (b)(3) to reflect comments made byGranite Construction (Ex. 17-24), among others (Exs. 17-4, 17-21, 17-32),who suggested more flexible performance language that allows the employerto select appropriate effective methods of controlling unauthorized entry.Paragraph (c) Check-in/Check-out Paragraph (a)(6) of the current standard requires a check-in and check-outsystem that will provide positive identification of every employee underground.In addition, the standard requires that an accurate record and locationof the employees be kept on the surface. OSHA proposed to revise the existing standard in two ways: First, by requiringa check-in/check-out system at each above-ground entrance that would providethe employer with an accurate record of each person underground (see proposedparagraph (d)(1)); and second, by requiring each person underground towear or carry a means of positive personal identification (see proposedparagraph (d)(2)). OSHA stated that this check-in/check-out system wouldenable the employer to identify how many and which workers are underground(see 48 FR 35779). OSHA solicited comment on various methods for check-in and check-out, especiallyconcerning the effectiveness, maintenance costs, and any other associatedproblems (see 48 FR 35780). In response, OSHA received numerous comments,but few in favor of the proposed changes. These comments focused on thefour issues discussed below. The first issue pertains to the need for positive identification of everyemployee underground. Some commenters acknowledged the need to accountfor the number of employees underground in the event of an accident toassist rescue/recovery operations (Exs. 17-19 and 17-21A). Nevertheless,they argued that the intent of the standard is satisfied by knowing thenumber, but not necessarily the identities, of employees underground. OSHArecognizes that a check-in/check-out system may not contribute directlyto safety during normal operations. However, at the time of an undergroundemergency, such as a cave-in or an explosion, the ability to determineaccurately the number of employees underground is of significant value_bothto those employees who may be trapped underground, and also to those membersof the rescue crew who would be at risk during rescue operations. OSHAacknowledges that the benefits to be derived from this rule pertain mostdirectly to having an accurate count of the employees still underground,rather than to knowing the identify of each such employee. Therefore, OSHAhas deleted the positive identification requirement contained in the currentstandard at andSection; 1926.800(a)(6). The second issue, closely related to the issue of positive identificationjust discussed, pertains to the proposed requirement that each person undergroundwear or carry a means of positive identification. OSHA's rationale forthis proposed requirement was to determine which employees were still underground.OSHA further stated that the rescue team cannot be sure that all employeeshave been rescued unless a means of positive identification is provided(see 48 FR 35780). One commenter praised the rule as excellent and necessary, especially inhigh risk situations, although no rationale was provided (Ex. 17-14). Threecommenters criticized the proposal (Exs. 17-17, 17-19, 17-21A) on the check-in/check-outsystem (Ex. 21A). OSHA has analyzed the record and does not find sufficient justificationto require positive identification to be worn by each employee underground,in addition to maintaining an accurate above-ground count of the numberof employees underground. Although OSHA expects that most employers whocurrently use a system of identifying workers who are underground willcontinue to do so, the record fails to establish that an employer's failureto implement such a system subjects employees to a greater risk underground.Therefore, OSHA has dropped the proposed requirement that each person undergroundwear or carry a personal identification tag. The third issue pertains to the elements required for a check-in/check-outsystem. While OSHA did not propose specific components for the system,is was anticipated that a board and tags would be used (see 48 FR 35779).Indeed, OSHA's experience under the current standard has been that employerstypically use a brass tag system. Moreover, the use of the term ``record''in both the current standard and the proposal certainly implies a tangiblecomponent, such as a written list or a board with tags. Some commenters argued that the proposed language was too stringent, particularlyon smaller jobs where a less formal system may be just as effective andless burdensome (Exs. 17-21A, 17-32, and 17-33). For example, C and E ConstructionCompany (Ex. 17-33) contended that the brass tag system was unnecessaryfor crews of up to 10 men. On the other hand, Air Products and Chemicals,Inc. (Ex. 17-30) and Perini Corporation (Ex. 17-23) endorsed a brass tagsystem. OSHA agrees that the brass tag system is a good method of accountingfor employees underground and does not want to discourage its use. Nevertheless,OSHA sees merit in the assertion that other methods of accounting for personnelunderground may also be reliable, particularly on smaller jobs (see Ex.17-21-A, 17-32, and 17-33). The true test of whether any system is reliableis whether the employer knows at all times the number of employees underground.The record in this rulemaking does not demonstrate the clear superiorityof one method over others generally. Nor does the record support a particularnumber of employees as the threshold at which a more formal system involvinghardware of some kind, such as the brass-tag system, should be required. Therefore, Final Rule paragraph (c) simply requires that the employer maintaina procedure that will ensure an accurate count of the number of personsunderground in the event of an emergency. While the method of complianceis not prescribed in this Final Rule, and may be effective without theuse of a record, the employer remains responsible for assuring that anaccurate count of the number of persons underground is available to above-groundpersonnel in the event of an emergency (see paragraph (g)(3) below). Onlythrough planning and routinely following procedures will the employer knowaccurately the number of persons who were underground prior to the emergency,how many persons were able to evacuate, and how many persons remain tobe rescued.The fourth issue, which pertains to multiple above-ground entrances, isclosely related to the issue just discussed. OSHA received comments whichnoted that requiring check-in/check-out systems at multiple entrances wouldduplicate recordkeeping and be extremely impractical for many tunnelingprojects (Exs. 17-8, 17-21A, and the March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p.203). However, OSHA also received comment advocating a requirement thatemployers with jobsites having multiple points of access ensure reliablecommunication between the different check-out points to facilitate accountingfor personnel (Ex. 17-16). In light of these comments, and the deletionof the requirements for positive identification and for a tangible recordabove ground of each person underground, OSHA has also deleted the requirementfor a check-in/check-out system to be maintained at each above-ground entrance.Nevertheless, even though an employer's worksite has more than one entranceor exit, paragraph (c) of the Final Rule requires the employer by whatevermeans to ensure that an accurate count of persons underground is availableto above-ground personnel in preparing rescue efforts. See also paragraph(g)(3) of this Final Rule. Thus, the standard affords the employer flexibilityin selecting the appropriate method, in light of jobsite conditions.OSHA also proposed an exemption from the check-in/check-out system requirementfor certain underground facilities where major construction had essentiallybeen completed and environmental and structural hazards had been eliminated.OSHA received generally positive response to this part of the proposal(see, for example, Exs. 17-13 and 17-21A) and has therefore retained theexemption in this Final Rule.<T3>Paragraph (d) Safety Instruction</T3>OSHA received many comments on its proposed nine-point safety program inwhich commenters suggested that OSHA should require employees to be instructedonly in subjects that were relevant to the particular worksite (Exs. 17-4,17-13, 17-21A, 17-22, 17-24, 17-32). For example, the Associated GeneralContractors of America, Inc., argued that if employees are working in conditionswhich pose no threat of flooding, they should not have to be versed inflood control measures (Ex. 17-13). OSHA agrees that employees should receiveinstruction in the recognition and avoidance of hazards specific to theirworksite rather than receive general, boiler-plate type of instruction,and has revised the rule to require only that employees be instructed intopics that are appropriate for the jobsite.In addition, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)suggested that fire prevention and protection be included in the safetyinstruction (Ex. 17-27). OSHA agrees that this would be consistent withOSHA's emphasis on prevention of fires in underground construction areasand, accordingly, has added that topic to the list.OSHA has also clarified that check-in/check-out should be part of the emergencyprocedures covered in the employer's safety instruction. OSHA believesthat the effectiveness of the check-in/check-out procedure will be proportionalto the effort an employer invests in planning, and also to how well eachemployee has been instructed to perform his or her assigned function.OSHA proposed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(3) that a written outline ofthe safety program be available at the jobsite and be distrubuted to anddiscussed with each employee. As OSHA noted at 48 FR 35780, the currentstandard does not require a written safety program or a written outlineof the safety program, although andSection; 1926.20(b) requires employersto initiate and maintain such accident prevention programs as may be necessaryto comply with Part 1926, and many contractors produce written safety andhealth programs during OSHA inspections to demonstrate compliance withthis rule (see Ex. 21-13, Attachment 1).The purpose of distributing a written outline and discussing it with eachemployee was to inform the employees of the program. While OSHA concurswith those comments that extolled the value of training (see Exs. 17-13,17-22 and March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 642), OSHA has decided thatemployees can be instructed in the hazards, safeguards, and work ruleswithout the necessity of using a written outline. Therefore, the FinalRule does not require a program to be available in outline form at theworksite, or issued to the employee or discussed with the employee. OSHAwill look for evidence of the effectiveness of the accident preventioneffort at the worksite by observing physical conditions and interviewingemployees to determine their knowledge of the safety instructions.<T3>Paragraph (e) Notification</T3>The question of whether the notification to the on-coming shift of anysafety-related incidents should be in writing (48 FR 35781) elicited divergentcomments. Mr. Frederick Foote, Safety Consultant (Ex. 17-12), and Air Productsand Chemicals, Inc. (Ex. 17-30), both strongly supported a log of significantinformation to be signed by and passed between shift bosses. The UnitedBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners criticized the proposed language,pointing out that there was no specification in the rule of how the notificationwould be accomplished, or who would be notified (Ex. 17-11). The AssociatedGeneral Contractors of America approved OSHA's proposed performance language(Ex. 17-13), and Salgado Eastern Corporation acknowledged the ``good sense''of cautioning other employees concerning existing or potential hazards,but opposed having to ``fill any more file cabinets with useless records''(Ex. 17-32).OSHA believes that the record supports an explicit obligation on the partof employers to establish a procedure so that the on-coming shift is cautionedabout potentially hazardous conditions. Nevertheless, the record does notsupport adding to the employer's recordkeeping burden a requirement thatsuch notification be in writing. Therefore, OSHA has retained the performancelanguage in paragraph (e)(1), as proposed.Paragraph (e)(2) is substantively similar to what was proposed in paragraph(g)(2), which required employers engaged in underground construction tomaintain direct communications for coordination of activities with otheremployers whose operations may affect the safety of their employees. Mostcommenters agreed with the necessity to maintain direct communicationswith other employers whose operations may affect the safety of their employees(see Exs. 17-13, 17-22, 17-23, and 17-30). However, Kenny Construction(Ex. 17-21A) contended that the project owner or manager, not the contractor,is the only party with the authority to require compliance with a coordinationprocedure. OSHA acknowledges the value of active involvement by projectmanagers and owners in this coordination among contractors. Nevertheless,under the OSH Act, Congress made each employer ultimately responsible forthe safety and health of his or her own employees. Therefore, under thisstandard, the employer must initiate contact with other employers who mayaffect the safety of his employees.Comments were divided concerning whether employers should maintain a writtenrecord of such inter-employer coordination. Mr. J. T. Barr, with Air Productsand Chemicals, Inc., (Ex. 17-30) urged that OSHA require regular meetingsof both operations officials and safety coordinations, with written recordsof salient points. However, AGC of America, and the Carolinas Branch (Exs.17-13, 17-22), did not believe that a written record need be kept, butdid endorse inter-employer coordination. OSHA believes that it is the actualcoordination activity among employers that yields the benefits to employees,and this may be either oral or written. OSHA considered all these commentsand found insufficient evidence in the record to justify requiring a writtenrecord of coordination among employers.Paragraph (f) CommunicationsParagraph (f)(1) is substantively the same as proposed paragraph (g)(1)(i),except that the requirement for hoist station communication has been movedto paragraph (t)(5)(i)(J). The current standard, at andSection; 1926.800(b)(4),requires that telephone or other signal communications be provided betweenthe work face and the tunnel portal, but does not prescribe a particulardistance for the spacing of the components. The proposal explicitly permittednatural voice communication to be used in situations where the unassistedvoice could be readily understood above workplace noise. OSHA solicitedcomment on the desirability of using the proposed performance language,as opposed to designating specific intervals for the spacing of the components,such as those listed in the California and Michigan tunneling standards(see 48 FR 35781). OSHA received little comment on this issue. Of the commentsreceived, two generally endorsed the proposed change (Exs. 17-13 and 17-51),while another commenter stated that tunnels less than 500 feet long donot need communication systems unless the tunnel has a compressed air atmosphere(Ex. 17-32). OSHA has determined that the evidence in the record is tooinconclusive to warrant specific distance intervals. Thus, OSHA has concludedthat employee safety is best served by requiring a powered system whennatural unassisted voice communication is ineffective, without regard tospecific distance intervals.During the public hearings, Mr. H.B. Butcher of Fenix and Scisson, Inc.,questioned the feasibility of proposed paragraph (g)(1)(i):<ITAG tagnum="21">Radio transmission could cause premature firing of electric blastingcaps * * * and the Institute of Manufacturers of Explosives cautions againstthis possibility * * *. The alternative to radio transmission is hard wiretelephone lines. In order to meet the requirement of providing communicationsto each working face, considerable quantities of wire must be installedpermanently with a substantial additional amount of wiring being movedcontinuously (March 1984 Hearing transcript, pp. 569-571).</ITAG>OSHA believes, nevertheless, that radio is both a feasible and a cost-effectivemeans of voice communication. The hazard of triggering electric blastingcaps can be avoided by switching to non-electric detonators. Alternatively,voice-activated communications systems, similar to those used in mines,could be used in the vicinity of electric detonators. In addition, forlarge tunnel sites, the use of wired telephones appears to be common; virtuallyall large sites visited by JRB (OSHA's contractor) had wired telephones(see Ex. 11, Appendix C, pp. 42-124). For small tunnel sites, OSHA expectsthat power-asssisted bullhorns could be used. OSHA therefore concludesthat this provision is technologically feasible and appropriate.Paragraph (f)(2) is also substantially the same as proposed paragraph (g)(1)(ii).Fenix and Scisson (Ex. 17-20) questioned whether a telephone and a bellsignal system would qualify as ``two effective means of communication''as stated in the proposed standard. OSHA's intent is to permit the employerto choose the two means of communication as long as one is a voice communicationsystem, and both are ``effective.'' C and E Construction (Exs. 17-33) recommendeda gas-operated horn, with a simple set of signals posted at the portaland on top, as a second communication system. Although the standard doesnot prescribe a horn or a bell, OSHA expects that either signal system,supplementing a voice communication system, could be ``effective'' forthis purpose.Paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) [proposed paragraphs (g)(1) (iv) and (v),respectively] received only supportive comment (e.g., Exs. 17-13) and thereforeremain unchanged in the Final Rule.Paragraph (f)(5) revises proposed paragraph (g)(1)(vi) and incorporatespublic comments. Kenny Construction (Exs. 17-21A) stated that ``Sporadicmaintenance activities or activities in completely supported sections ofa tunnel or shaft do not require a special communication system. The riskof an accident is insignificant and would not justify the cost of sucha system. The rule should apply only to employees working alone in hazardousareas.'' A.G.C. (Exs. 17-13 and 17-22) also recommended the inclusion ofthe ``in hazardous locations'' qualifier. CAL/OSHA Rule 8410(h) and MSHA57.18-25 both specify protection for an employee working alone in a hazardouslocation, such as one with a hydrogen sulfide atmosphere, or one whereremotely controlled equipment is operating. Based on these comments, OSHAhas determined that the limiting phrase ``working in hazardous locations''should be added. OSHA has also clarified the proposed language ``exceptwhen in view of other persons'' by prescribing that the employee be ``underobservation by other persons'' and not simply viewable.Mr. Ben Hill, International Union of Operating Engineers, asked for a specificationof distance to define ``working alone'' (March 1984 Hearing Transcript,pp. 731-732). OSHA believes that, in the context of working in a hazardouslocation, the conditions of not being watched and being unable to be heardare more valid criteria for defining ``working alone'' than simply distance,and the Final Rule reflects that belief.Paragraph (g) Emergency ProvisionsOSHA's current standard at andSection;1926.800(b)(2) requires emergency hoistingfacilities to be ``readily available at shafts more than 50 feet in depth,unless hoisting facilities are provided that are independent of electricalpower failures.''OSHA proposed in paragraph (i)(1) to require advance arrangements for emergencyhoisting capability to be on site or close at hand at jobsites where hoistingwould expedite emergency procedures, such as underground construction operationsdependent upon shafts for access. OSHA stated that this requirement wouldapply even at shafts where the primary hoist is powered independently ofthat shaft's electrical system. OSHA also stated that this rule would applyto all shafts used for access, regardless of depth, since injured employeesat the bottom of shafts less than 50 feet deep may need hoisting assistance(see 48 FR 35783). Both Section 8.2 of the ANSI standard, and Rule 408.41463of the Michigan standard require emergency hoisting facilities to be readilyavailable unless hoisting facilities are provided that are independentof electrical power failures.Commenters contended that emergency hoisting is not necessary if a craneis the primary hoisting means. Salgado Construction stated that the chanceof a crane being down at the same time someone is injured is very remote(Ex. 17-32). C and E Construction asserted that a secondary hoist systemis cost-prohibitive and unnecessary, except in the remote possibility thatthe primary hoist is electric (Ex. 17-33). Al Johnson Construction Companystated, without elaboration, that backup systems would be burdensome inmany cases (Ex. 17-19).OSHA reemphasizes that this backup hoisting capability does not necessarilyhave to be provided at every jobsite, but only at underground constructionoperations were a shaft is used as a means of egress. In the proposal,OSHA provided examples of conditions where such a back-up capability wouldnot be required (see 48 FR 35783). In addition, OSHA also stated that theemergency hoisting capability need not be on the jobsite; it could be oncall from a source that could respond on a timely basis.Therefore, after considering these comments and the ANSI and Michigan Standards,OSHA has substantively retained the rule as proposed, but is only requiringan emergency hoisting means to be readily available when the primary hoistfunction could become inoperative due to an electrical power failure.OSHA proposed in paragraph (i)(2) to require self-rescuers for all employeesat work stations in underground areas where employees might be trappedby smoke or gas. This revision was developed to help clarify paragraph(b)(3) of the current standard, which had been interpreted by some alwaysto require self-rescuers only at the advancing face, regardless of whetheremployees at that face might be trapped by smoke or gas.Paragraph (g)(2) of the Final Rule retains that concept as proposed. Thestandard also reemphasizes OSHA's intention that the obligation to provideself-rescuers is not limited solely to employees at the advancing face.OSHA expects the employer to make a careful analysis of worksite conditions(such as the use of combustible fuels or hydraulic fluids; the presenceof sources of ignition; the likelihood of liberation of flammable gasesbased on geological studies and air monitoring records; and the directionof air flow in relation to work stations) when deciding whether a particularwork station presents conditions in which an employee might be trappedby smoke or gas, and consequently would need respiratory protection forescape. OSHA fully expects that such an analysis could result in a decisionto not provide self-rescuers based on a lack of hazards such as combustiblefuels and materials, sources of ignition, flammable gases in combinationwith good ventilation and air quality.In response to OSHA's request for comments related to self-rescuer use(48 FR 35783), OSHA received favorable comment concerning both the carbonmonoxide (CO) type of self-rescuer and the self-contained type. The AssociatedGeneral Contractors of America_the Colorado Chapter, the Carolinas Branch,and the National Office (Exs. 17-51, 17-13, 17-22)_stated that the CO self-rescueris adequate, and that self-contained self-rescuers should not be required.On the other hand, Mr. Dan McAuliffe, with the International Union of OperatingEngineers, urged the use of self-contained self-rescuers in the parts ofthe country that have gas problems, provided that the apparatus was notso heavy as to be impractical (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 735).The record (Ex. 11, pp. 4-13 and 4-14) indicates that lightweight, compressed-oxygenemergency self-rescuers, rated for one hour under escape conditions (longerperiods if the user is passively awaiting rescue), have been approved byMSHA and NIOSH.OSHA proposed, in paragraph (i)(2), a cross-reference to andSection;1926.103(b)which requires that the selection of respiratory protection be based onthe worksite conditions. That paragraph applies industry-wide to construction,and gives employers the flexibility to tailor their respiratory protectionprogram to the variables at each worksite.Mr. Bruce Summers, with Granite Construction Company (Ex. 17-48), statedthat OSHA should not reference andSection;1926.103 for the selection andmaintenance requirements for respirators until the self-contained self-rescuercan be made economically feasible. Mr. Summers stated that the presentcost of such equipment would be prohibitive for all tunnel operations.Contrary to this apprehension, however, the cross-reference to andSection;1926.103does not effectively prescribe the use of self-rescuers in all undergroundconstruction operations and, most importantly, does not require the self-containedtype of self-rescuers for all tunnel operations. Paragraph (g)(2) of theFinal Rule only requires self-rescuers for those employees who might betrapped by smoke or gas.OSHA finds that the record does not support a requirement for one typeof self-rescuer over the another in all circumstances. However, the recorddoes support a requirement that the selection of the self-rescuer be inaccordance with andSection;1926.103(b). It remains the employer's duty toselect the type and capacity of approved self-rescuer based on the worksiteconditions. Moreover, retaining the cross-reference to andSection;1926.103addresses the concerns raised by Mr. J.T. Barr, with Air Products and Chemicals(Ex. 17-30), that the standard include a requirement that the self-rescuermust have adequate capacity for the situation at hand.The last sentence in paragraph (i)(2) of the proposal explicitly requiredemployees to be trained in the use of self-rescuers. OSHA has deleted thissentence because it is redundant with andSection;1926.103(c)(1), which alreadyimposes a duty upon employers to train properly those employees who mightbe required to use self-rescuers.Objections were raised because the proposal merely required that self-rescuersbe kept at work stations, rather than worn on the belts of workers (seefor example, March 1984 Hearing Transcript, pp. 726-735; and Exs. 17-46).Nevertheless, the current standard at andSection; 1926.800(b)(3) does notrequire that self-rescuers be worn on the person of the employee, and therecord in this proceeding does not support such a change. Therefore, theFinal Rule does not specify how or where the self-rescuer must be kept,although the standard clearly requires that it must be in the immediatearea of any employee who might be trapped by smoke or gas in the eventof an emergency such as a fire. Either having an employee wear the self-rescueron his or her belt or having a cache of self-rescuers within the immediatework area of employees who might need them would fulfill the requirementsof the performance language.  OSHA has slightly modified proposed paragraph (i)(3), designated person,to make paragraph (g)(3) of the Final Rule compatible with changes madeto other parts of the standard, such as check-in/check-out (paragraph (c))and evacuation procedures (paragraph (d)). The final rule provides thatin addition to securing aid in an emergency, the designated person is alsoassigned to keep an accurate count of the number of employees underground(see paragraph (c) above).  OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (i)(4) to clarify that a flashlightneed not be MSHA-approved. Although the proposed standard required an MSHA-approvedhand-lamp or cap-lamp, OSHA stated in the accompanying text that an ``approved''flashlight would meet the proposed requirement (48 FR 35784). Paragraph(g)(4) of the Final Rule requires the lamp to be ``acceptable,'' whichis defined in new paragraph (u), Definitions, to mean ``Any device, equipment,or appliance that is either approved by MSHA and maintained in permissiblecondition, or is listed or labeled for the class and location under SubpartK of this Part.''  The requirements for rescue teams proposed in paragraph (i)(5) provokedmany comments. The majority of the commenters_including six undergroundconstruction contractors (Exs. 17-4, 17-21A, 17-23, 17-24, 17-32 and 17-33)_agreedwith OSHA's proposal to allow locally available teams to provide rescueservices to an underground construction site. The record indicates thatusing locally available rescue teams saves both training and equipmentcosts, and that police and fire department paramedics are better trainedand experienced to handle emergencies (Exs. 17-4 and 17-32). However, manycommenters did not support the proposed requirement that two 5-person rescueteams be available at all underground construction sites, and recommendedthat OSHA revise the rule to correlate the rescue capability to the numberof employees working underground (see, for example, Exs. 17-1, 17-8, 17-13,17-19, 17-21A, 17-22 and 17-24). On the basis of these comments, OSHA hasdetermined not to change the size criteria in the existing standard (atandSection; 1926.800(e)(1)(xii)) which requires the training of at leasttwo rescue teams (10 employees divided between shifts) when 25 or moreemployees work underground at one time, and of not less than five employeesat smaller operations. However, OSHA has retained the proposed requirementsthat the primary team be available either on the jobsite or within one-halfhour travel time, and that the second team be available within two hourstravel time.  As proposed (48 FR 35784), an employer could use a locally available teamin lieu of training and equipping his own employees. The current standard,at andSection; 1926.800(e)(1)(xxi), implies that rescue team members be employeesof the underground construction employer, although OSHA has allowed localrescue services to fulfill this requirement. OSHA has removed any ambiguityregarding the use of local rescue teams. The standard requires the employerto ensure that rescue team members have the proper training and equipmentto effect a rescue at the underground construction jobsite; can respondwithin the specified travel time; and are familiar with the environmentand configuration of the underground worksite (see testimony of Mr. DaveBell, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, March 1984Hearing Transcript, p. 786).  In paragraph (i)(5)(ii), OSHA proposed to continue the current requirementfor annual training of rescue team members, and added a requirement forpracticing the use of the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) forat least 30 minutes every month. Objections were raised regarding the proposedpractice frequency and duration. For example, Mr. G.B. Knight, with S.A.Healy Company, stated that annual training should only require a refreshercourse, rather than the entire course, after the first year. Mr. Knightalso questioned the need for monthly practice on SCBA after the initialtraining, asserting that the trained person is not likely to lose the abilityto use the equipment (Ex. 17-29). Similarly, Mr. I.J. Meyerson, with BoeingAerospace Company, stated that 30 minutes of SCBA practice is excessiveto the point that it would exhaust the air supply. Mr. Meyerson contendedthat, aside from causing great expense, the proposal would produce no apparentincrease in proficiency, as compared to frequent donning and operationwithout taking 30 minutes per session and without wasting standby air supplies.He recommended that the paragraph be revised to require that rescue teammembers be trained and practice often enough to maintain the necessaryproficiency (Ex. 17-39). On the basis of the above comments, OSHA has determinedthat the proposed 30-minutes-practice requirement is not necessary, andthat the annual training requirement provides the requisite degree of safety. Therefore, the Final Rule provides, at paragraph (g)(5)(iv), that at allunderground construction sites where flammable or noxious gases are encounteredor anticipated in hazardous quantities, rescue team members shall practicedonning and using self-contained breathing apparatus monthly. At othersites, rescue team members must have at least an annual review of theirqualifications (see paragraph (g)(5)(iii)).Paragraph (h) Hazardous Classifications<ITAG tagnum="21">[<T4>Note: </T4>In the August 5, 1983 Proposed Rule, OSHA solicited commentsrelated to the first aid, medical service, and sanitation needs for undergroundconstruction operations, and reserved paragraph (h) for the possible inclusionof such requirements in the Final Rule (48 FR 35782-83). However, the recorddoes not demonstrate the need to supplement the existing standards in andSection;andSection;1926.50 and 1926.51 of this Part which cover these topics. Rather thanleave paragraph (h) reserved, OSHA has used this available space to placecriteria for the classifications of ``Potentially Gassy'' and ``Gassy Operations.'']</ITAG>The proposal added new provisions and revised the existing provisions governingthe hazards associated with flammable gas in a new paragraph entitled ``GassyOperations.'' OSHA also proposed_in paragraph (j)(1)(xii)_air monitoringcriteria (five percent of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) for methane,10 percent LEL for other flammable gases, and 20 percent LEL for petroleumvapors in any open workings) which would cause an operation to be classifiedas ``gassy.'' The LEL of a material is the minimum concentration of vaporin air below which propagation of a flame will not occur in the presenceof an ignition source. OSHA's proposal would have required an undergroundconstruction operation to be classified as gassy whenever a one-time readingat the prescribed percent LEL was detected. Furthermore, once classifiedas gassy, the operation would be operated thereafter as gassy, with noprovision for reverting to a less hazardous classification.OSHA received many comments related to the new gassy requirements. Themajority of these comments focused on three areas of concern. The firstarea was the use of three different percentages of the LELs for specificgases and vapors. The second area was whether an underground constructionoperation should be classified as gassy based on a one-time reading ofthe flammable gas, or if the flammable gas should continue for some intervalof time. The third area that OSHA received comment on was whether a gassyoperation must remain classified as gassy or if it can be reclassifiedto a less stringent classification.Many comments suggested that the proposed three-tier air monitoring requirementsfar exceeded the capabilities of most underground construction contractors,or, more specifically, the capabilities of those competent persons assignedto perform air monitoring. These comments also questioned the ability offlammable gas monitors currently used underground to discriminate betweenvarious flammable gases. For example, Mr. Bruce G. Summers, with GraniteConstruction Company (Ex. 17-24), stated that three different tiers couldlead to confusion and would require at least three differently calibratedinstruments for flammable gases or vapors alone, noting that most instrumentsfor detection of flammable gases are calibrated on methane, which coversthe majority of flammable gases encountered. Mr. Summers suggested that,for clarity and simplicity, a concentration of five percent or more ofthe LEL of methane or other flammable gas should be used to define ``gassy.''Mr. Joseph Hadden, with MSHA, testified that rather than a three-tieredsystem, all flammable gases should be measured against a one-level system(March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 172), the then-current MSHA method forclassifying an operation as gassy in metal and non-metal mines (30 CFR57.21001, 1983 edition).Dr. Verne Brown (Ex. 30) stated that the three-tiered distinction for LELswould require an analysis of atmospheric combustible gas vapors beyondthe competence of most firms engaged in underground construction, and perhapsbeyond the sophistication of the instruments available to such firms. Hestated that portable, hand-held gas detectors are the existing practicalinstrument for the construction industry. Mr. Brown further stated thatinstrumentation is primarily calibrated for methane and cannot identifymixtures of gases; this can only be done using gas chromatography (March1984 Hearing Transcript, pp. 353-395). Thus, in his view, the three-tieredgassy crtieria would force the use of laboratory analytical equipment forgas chromatography.Dr. Brown also testified that if OSHA maintained the five percent LEL methanecriterion, it would very likely result in more than 50 percent of the tunnelconstruction projects being classified as gassy. OSHA has not been ableto verify this estimate, but agrees that a larger percentage of the tunnelswould indeed be classified as ``gassy'' under the five percent LEL criterion.In light of the instrumentation feasibility limitations, the Final Rulerefers to ``methane or other flammable gases'' rather than specifying particulargases. Moreover, the comments have persuaded OSHA to drop the proposedthree-tiered ``gassy'' classification system based on different percentagesof LEL. Although OSHA proposed three different LELs as gassy classificationcriteria, the Agency believes that one level is adequate for employee safety.In addition, the Final Rule establishes 10 percent of the LEL as the level,above which an underground operation is classified as potentially gassyor gassy. This percentage is consistent with the criterion used to determinesafe entry of personnel in OSHA's Shipyard Employment Standards (see 29CFR 1915.12(a)(2)). The December 1979 NIOSH Criteria for a RecommendedStandard related to Working in Confined Spaces also uses 10 percent LowerFlammable Limit as the recommended maximum concentration of flammable gas.It should be noted that the 10-percent level in paragraphs (h) (1) and(2) establish criteria for classifying operations as potentially gassyor gassy, and for triggering the additional requirements for such conditions.Other provisions of the standard require precautionary action to be takenwherever five percent or more of the LEL for methane or other flammablegases is detected (see paragraph (j)).The second area that provoked comment was OSHA's proposal to classify anunderground construction operation as gassy whenever a one-time readingof the specified (five, ten, or twenty) percent LEL was detected (48 FR35813 and 35818). OSHA received comment charging that this approach wasexcessively and unjustifiably stringent (see, for example, Exs. 17-19,17-21A, 31 and 37). Mr. John Kenny, with Kenny Construction, argued thatthe contractor should be given the opportunity to dilute the gas and restorethe atmosphere to normal levels before declaring the job ``gassy'' or shuttingit down (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 496). Mr. Michael F. Duffy,representing the American Mining Congress, pointed out that in June 1983MSHA had abandoned the ``all or nothing'' approach to classifying gassymines adopted in OSHA's proposal and had proposed a ``radically differentapproach,'' categorizing mines according to the circumstances under whichflammable gas occurs and the degree of hazard involved (Ex. 37). Mr. Duffyurged that OSHA delay the revision of the gassy portion of the UndergroundConstruction standard until the Agency could review the completed MSHAclassification scheme.Mr. A. A. Mathews, an internationally recognized expert in tunnel construction,served as a consultant to OSHA contractor JRB/SAIC during this rulemaking(Ex. 23). Mr. Mathews stated that a suitable criterion for distinguishinga continuous gassy condition from an isolated pocket of gas would be thepersistence of the excess concentration for some period of time. Mr. Mathewsacknowledged that establishing a reasonable time period is a judgment call;he suggested three days. He also endorsed a three-day criterion as a suitablelength of time to determine whether an occurrence of hydrogen sulfide gasmight be an isolated pocket or a more persistent condition.It is well known (and was substantiated by many of the commenters) thatthe costs of an underground construction project increase greatly whenit is classified as ``gassy.'' For example, Mr. Charles Kelso, DillinghamConstruction Company, stated that after the bid documents were revisedto drop the gassy classification on a tunnel job in California, the dollaramount of the bids dropped about 50 percent (March 1984 Hearing Transcript,p. 681). Mr. Ronald Searle, with the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureauof Reclamation, referred to some preliminary engineering studies showingthat an underground construction operation costs considerably more to operateunder gassy conditions than under non-gassy or potentially gassy conditions.Mr. Searle said that when the Bureau of Reclamation anticipates that anunderground construction project is going to be potentially gassy, theBureau also prescribes certain criteria for the contractor to comply within the hope that, if gas is encountered, it can be handled before conditionsattain the threshold for a gassy classification (March 1984 Hearing Transcript,pp. 122-123).OSHA finds merit in these comments, and recognizes that the substantialcosts associated with graduating immediately from a non-gassy to a gassyclassification are not necessary to protect employees where intermediate,less costly measures suffice to abate the hazard. Therefore, the proposalhas been revised to retain protection for employees while relieving theeconomic burden on employers. OSHA has adjusted the Final Rule so thatan underground construction operation where gassy conditions are anticipatedwould initially be classified as ``potentially gassy.'' Only after thepresence of 10 percent of the LEL of flammable gas had continued for threeconsecutive days would the more stringent classification of ``gassy'' berequired. This phased-in approach allows an assessment to be made of theduration and extent of the flammable gas concentration while providingthe opportunity to control or dilute the gas before ``gassy'' conditionsare achieved.The third area which provoked comment was OSHA's proposed requirement (paragraph(u)(l)) that once an underground construction operation was classifiedas gassy, it would be operated thereafter as gassy, with no provision forreverting to a less stringent classification based on a reassessment ofthe air quality. Dr. Verne Brown (Ex. 30) stated that the proposal presumedthat an area stays ``gassy'' and cannot be reduced back to safe levels.Mr. A. A. Mathews recommended that as a job progresses, if the geologyencountered is found to be significantly better than anticipated, and ifexcessive concentrations of gas are not found, the gassy portion of a jobcan be reclassified (Ex. 23).OSHA is persuaded by Dr. Brown's and Mr. Mathew's comments and the reasonablenessof the three day phase-in period. OSHA agrees that an operation can bedeclassified without jeopardizing employees. Although the appropriate periodof time for completing the declassification was not widely discussed inthe comments, OSHA has determined that the three-day span is reasonableand consistent with the statutory purpose. OSHA has therefore added thecriterion for declassifying a ``gassy'' underground construction operationto ``potentially gassy'' after three consecutive days of less than 10 percentLEL readings on the flammable gas monitor. However, if any of the conditionsset forth in paragraph (h)(2) are encountered again, the operation wouldbe reclassified as gassy.OSHA has also revised the language of proposed paragraph (j)(1)(xii) byreplacing the term ``in any open workings'' with ``in any underground workarea'' for purpose of clarity. ``Open workings'' is a mining term whichmay be unfamiliar to many underground construction contractors. Finally, the criteria for identifying an operation as ``gassy'' which appearedin paragraph (u)(1) of the proposal, have been moved to paragraph (h)(2)of the Final Rule for reformatting purposes. Most of the remainder of paragraph(u) of the proposal has been moved to paragraph (i). Paragraph (i) Gassy Operations_Additional Requirements The requirements for gassy operations that were proposed in paragraphs(u) (2) through (6) have been transferred to paragraph (i). OSHA did notreceive substantive comments on these provisions; rather it was the proposedclassification system which would have triggered the application of theserules that evoked comment. The revisions to the classification system discussed above necessitatedthe addition of paragraph (i)(6) to make the system practical from botha compliance and a cost standpoint. Paragraph (h) requires the employerto classify an operation as ``gassy'' after air monitoring discloses flammablegas concentrations of 10 percent LEL or more for three consecutive days.During those three days, the employer may take steps to attempt to controlthe gas by means such as increasing the ventilation or by grouting theentry point for the gas. If the gas is only an isolated pocket, it maybleed off to a negligible amount, removing the need to classify the operationas ``gassy.'' After three days, if the gas remains at or greater than 10percent LEL, the operation will be classified as ``gassy.'' Thus, whenan operation has changed from potentially gassy to a gassy classification,the contractor who has not already come into compliance with the gassyoperation equipment requirements at the end of the three-day period wouldbe in violation. OSHA has added paragraph (i)(6) to allow the time necessaryto come into compliance with the ``gassy'' provisions. To ensure the safetyof employees, and to prevent this phase-in allowance from being abused,OSHA requires that all operations except the three prescribed in the rulebe suspended in the affected area. Since the suspension of operations is expensive, this will ensure a goodfaith effort by the employer either to control the gas or to come intocompliance with the gassy operation requirements. Normal operations maybe resumed as soon as the employer has either implemented the necessarymodifications to comply with the gassy operations requirements, or hascontrolled the gas to the point that the area can be declassified. Paragraph (j) Air Quality and Monitoring OSHA noted in the proposal that contaminated air is a hazard that oftenresults in serious injury or death (48 FR 35774-35777). Paragraph (j) containsthe requirements related to air quality and monitoring which are intendedto reduce that hazard potential. The format is the same as that in theproposed rule. Paragraph (j)(1) contains the general requirements thatapply to all underground construction operations. OSHA had proposed in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) (A)-(D) a list of circumstancesduring which employees could work temporarily in atmospheres having concentrationsof airborne contaminants exceeding the limits prescribed in andSection; 1926.55,provided that respirators were used in accordance with andSection; 1926.103.The Final Rule retains the reference to andSection; 1926.55 for air qualitylimits and control requirements, but OSHA has deleted the proposed specificationof extraordinary work situations because those are already sufficientlycovered in andSection;andSection; 1926.55 and 1926.103, and because the Agencydoes not intend to exclude, by omitting them from the list, other worksituations which may warrant the use of respiratory protection. OSHA has carried forward proposed paragraphs (j)(1)(ii) (A) and (B) intoFinal Rule paragraphs (j)(1)(i) (A) and (B) with editorial clarification.These standards assign the competent person to make a reasonable determinationas to which substances to monitor and the frequency of such monitoring.Specific topics that the competent person must consider when making suchreasonable determinations are contained in paragraph (j)(1)(i)(B). Thesestandards allow the competent person to tailor the monitoring program tosuit the jobsite conditions, which may vary greatly. This flexibility enablesthe competent person to avoid unnecessary monitoring and to focus on theactual air contaminants at that site. The competent person must met therequirements specified on andSection; 1926.32(f). OSHA proposed in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) that the upper limit of oxygen inall underground work areas not exceed the atmospheric level typical ofthe locality (approximately 21 percent). OSHA explained that this new requirementwould reduce the likelihood of ignitions and explosions due to oxygen-enrichedatmospheres (see 48 FR 35735). OSHA initially made the reference to localitiesdue to a mistaken impression that oxygen concentration varies due to differencesin elevation. Although no comments on this point were received, OSHA realizesthat it is the density of the air which varies with elevation and not theconcentration (percent by volume) of oxygen. Therefore, any reference tolocal variations in oxygen concentration is inappropriate since the hazardis related to the percent by volume of oxygen in the atmosphere. In the proposal, OSHA referred to the ``National Fire Protection Handbook''as recognizing the increased flammability hazard associated with oxygen-enrichedatmospheres (see 48 FR 35786). That Handbook (14th edition) defines anoxygen-enriched atmosphere, at p. 5-40, as ``any atmosphere in which theconcentration of oxygen exceeds 21 percent by volume, or the partial pressureof oxygen exceeds 160 torr (millimeters of mercury), or both.'' OSHA proposedthe acceptable upper limit of oxygen in accordance with this definition.OSHA solicited information about accidents related to oxygen-enriched atmospheres,and also on the appropriateness of the proposed 21 percent upper limit(see 48 FR 35786). In response, OSHA received no information pertainingto related accidents, and little comment on the rule itself (see Exs. 17-11and 17-30). Mr. J.T. Barr responded that the unspecified upper limit ofoxygen was not only unclear, but it conflicted with the 23-percent oxygenlevel discussed in the preamble to the proposal as the appropriate upperlimit to minimize the potential for fire or explosion (see 48 FR 35794).Mr. Barr recommended a lower limit of 19.5 and an upper limit of 23 percentoxygen. He stated that the rate of combustion is not accelerated significantlyat 23 percent as compared to 21 percent oxygen content, and this allowssufficient leeway to avoid argument over analytical differences. Dr. VerneBrown supported 19.5 percent as the minimum level for oxygen, but recommendedthat OSHA revise the upper limit of oxygen from 21 percent to a limit ashigh as 25 percent as recommended in the 1979 NIOSH Criteria for a RecommendedStandard-Working in Confined Spaces (Ex. 30). That document states thatif testing indicates the oxygen level to be greater than 25 percent, thenthere shall be no entry into confined spaces, and hot work is prohibiteduntil ventilating techniques have reduced the oxygen level to approximately21 percent. OSHA notes that, subsequent to these comments, the National Fire ProtectionAssociation has addressed these same concerns in the 1988 standard NFPA306 Control for Gas Hazards on Vessels. That standard provides that theappropriate upper limit for both employee exposure and hot work is 22 percentby volume. The NFPA selected this limit for reasons of the accuracy ofthe meter and the precision with which it can be read. This limit is withinthe range of limits considered by OSHA and discussed by the commenters.OSHA recognizes the expertise of the NFPA in such matters, and is persuadedthat the standard should specify an upper limit of oxygen to control flammabilityhazards in oxygen-enriched atmospheres. Accordingly, OSHA has adopted theNFPA 306 (1988) upper limit. Paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this Final Ruleestablishes an upper limit of 22 percent oxygen at normal atmopsheric pressure.OSHA has revised Final Rule paragraph (j)(1)(iii)(B), formerly proposedparagraph (j)(l)(iv)(B), to conform with the reformatting of other paragraphs,the addition of the potentially gassy classification, and the revisionof the proposed three-tiered listing of ``methane, petroleum vapors, andother flammable gases'' to the more generic phrase ``methane and otherflammable gases.'' OSHA has revised Final Rule paragraph (j)(1)(iv), formerly proposed paragraph(j)(1)(v), to use the term ``rapid excavation machines'' rather than ``tunnelboring machines.'' However, no revision was made to the requirement forsuch machines to be equipped with a flammable gas monitor. OSHA explainedthat ``tunnel boring machines,'' as used in the proposal, are mechanicalexcavating machines designed to cut through soil or rock (see 48 FR 35786).Therefore, the term rapid excavation machines includes tunnel boring machines,shields, roadheaders, and other similar machines. OSHA has also revised the proposal concerning monitoring for hydrogen sulfide(H<T2>2</T2>S) by clarifying where monitoring must be performed, and by changingthe concentration at which an alarm must sound. Paragraph (j)(1)(v)(A)retains the proposed requirement for twice-a-shift monitoring of H<T2>2</T2>S once its presence is detected. However, OSHA has added thecriterion which allows cessation of the twice-a-shift monitoring afterthree consecutive days without the detection of additional H<T2>2</T2>S. Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(vi) prescribed that whenever the presence ofH<T2>2</T2>S was detected, testing for H<T2>2</T2>S had to be conducted ``in all underground work areas'' at thebeginning and mid-point of each shift. Several commenters argued that thedetection of gas in one work area does not necessarily indicate the presenceof hazardous conditions in all other work areas (Exs. 17-24, 17-26, 23,31). It was pointed out that many projects have work areas that are a longdistance apart, often a mile or more (Ex. 31, p. 51). OSHA concurs thatif the presence of H<T2>2</T2>S has not been detected in other underground work areas, thentwice-per-shift monitoring should not be required in those locations. However,the prudent competent person should consider the variables present at thatjob site to determine the testing frequency in other nearby undergroundwork areas where H<T2>2</T2>S has not yet been detected. For example, differing geology ordifferent courses of air could account for H<T2>2</T2>S appearing in one work area and not in another work area. Oncethe presence of H<T2>2</T2>S has been detected, the Final Rule requires that monitoringbe performed twice a shift in each work area where it was detected.One commenter stated that OSHA was attempting to resurrect the ``actionlevel'' concept by requiring monitoring to begin at a level less than theexposure limit; he suggested that OSHA was lowering the exposure limitfor H<T2>2</T2>S to five ppm (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 356). Plainly,though, OSHA has not revised the exposure limit for H<T2>2</T2>S in this proceeding. Moreover, a requirement for monitoringto begin at a level less than the exposure limit is used in other OSHAstandards that regulate worker exposure to toxic substances (see, for example,29 CFR 1910.1017, 1910.1018, 1910.1025, and 1910.1045). It is consistentwith OSHA policy and sound industrial hygiene principles to require reasonableprecautions to protect workers from recognized hazards.Mr. Patrick Moore, a specialist in H<T2>2</T2>S analyzers, supported the proposed rule to require continuousmonitoring once H<T2>2</T2>S has been detected in amounts approaching five ppm. Mr. Moorestated that the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide is too great to assume therisk that a one-time detection is merely an isolated pocket (March 1984Hearing transcript, p. 243).A written submission provided jointly by the National Utility ContractorsAssociation, the Underground Contractors Association and Kenny ConstructionCompany questioned the availability of equipment to monitor H<T2>2</T2>S at levels of five ppm (Ex. 31, p. 51). By contrast, Mr. Moorestated at the hearing that the technology presently exists to detect, accuratelyand specifically, hydrogen sulfide concentrations of less than five ppm,as well as concentrations in excess of that amount (March 1984 HearingTranscript, p. 247). In addition, OSHA notes that numerous H<T2>2</T2>S monitors are available that can detect hydrogen sulfide ata concentration of five ppm.OSHA proposed in paragraph (J)(1)(vi)(D) that the continuous monitor providea visual and aural alarm when 10 ppm H<T2>2</T2>S is reached. Dr. Verne Brown recommended that OSHA use 10 ppmH<T2>2</T2>S as the trigger point for requiring continuous monitoring, ratherthan the proposed five ppm level (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 356).The May 1977 ``NIOSH Criteria for a recommended standard * * * OccupationalExposure to Hydrogen Sulfide'' recommends that fixed (non-portable) monitoringdevices have an alarm to notify employees whenever there is an H<T2>2</T2>S concentration greater than 10 ppm.OSHA's current exposure limit for employees engaged in construction workis 10 ppm H<T2>2</T2>S as an eight hour time-weighted average (TWA) (see andSection;1926.55). The 10 ppm H<T2>2</T2>S limit is derived from the 1970 American Conference of GovernmentalIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLV) Tables. Accordingto the more recent 1980 ACGIH TLV Tables, nearly all workers may be repeatedlyexposed to a TWA concentration of 10 ppm H<T2>2</T2>S for a normal 8-hour workday or a 40-hour workweek day afterday without adverse effect. In reexamining the proposed language that requiredan alarm to sound (for an unspecified length of time) when the 10 ppm concentrationis reached, OSHA recognizes that, as proposed, workers could have remainedworking underground with the alarm sounding for the complete shift. The1977 NIOSH Criteria Document concerning occupational exposure to hydrogensulfide noted above states that the 10 ppm alarm should be for alert onlyand should not trigger evacuation. Both the Michigan standard (R325.50213(2))and the former OSHA General Industry Standard (29 CFR 1910.1000, TableZ-2) established a ceiling limit for exposure to hydrogen sulfide at 20ppm but do not set an 8-hour TWA. In the recently published Final Ruleon Air Contaminants (54 FR 2332), which revised andSection; 1910.1000, newlimits for hydrogen sulfide were set at 10 ppm 8-hour TWA with a 15 ppmshort term exposure limit (STEL) (15 minutes). (As noted earlier, the currentconstruction standard for H<T2>2</T2>S in andSection; 1926.55 sets a 10 ppm TWA, but has no STEL.) Asnoted in the preamble to the Air Contaminants Final Rule (54 FR 2783),OSHA is in the process of formally consulting with the Advisory Committeeon Construction Safety and Health about whether the revised limits shouldbe extended to construction. Such consultation is required prior to proposingnew standards that have a major impact on construction (see 29 CFR 1911.10(a)).Based on the present rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that, at 10ppm H<T2>2</T2>S, workers must be informed that they are in an atmosphere whichhas reached the Permissible Exposure Level, but an alarm is not requiredfor this purpose (see Final Rule (j)(1)(v)(c)). The Final Rule, at paragraph(j)(1)(v)(D), requires that the continuous monitor provide a visual anda aural alarm when the concentration of hydrogen sulfide reaches 20 ppm,in order to signal that additional measures, such as respirator use, increasedventilation, or evacuation, might be necessary to maintain exposures belowthe permissible exposure limit.An employer may use a monitor with two distinctive alarms, one for 10 ppmnotification and the other for 20 ppm evacuation, as long as employeescan distinguish between the two alarms. Any other effective method of informingemployees that they are at the 10 ppm level would also be permitted underthe standard.As proposed, paragraph (j)(1)(viii) required that precautionary measuresbe taken whenever a 10 percent LEL flammable gas or petroleum vapor concentrationis detected. As explained above regarding paragraph (h), this Final Ruleestablishes 10 percent LEL methane or other flammable gas as the thresholdfor classifying an operation as ``potentially gassy.'' Once an operationis classified ``potentially gassy,'' an employer must comply with an additionalset of requirements. The current industry practice is to reduce or dilutethe flammable gas concentration before it attains the level that wouldrequire compliance with the more costly ``gassy'' or even the ``potentiallygassy'' provisions (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, pp. 123, 155-156, 494-496,501-502). Obviously, precautionary measures to control flammable gas mustbe undertaken before the ``potentially gassy'' threshold is reached. Therefore,paragraph (j)(1)(vii) of this Final Rule requires the employer to beginefforts to reduce or otherwise control the gas concentration at five percentLEL of methane or other flammable gas. The record also suggested the needfor a mechanism for discontinuing extra precautionary measures once theair contamination hazard is controlled (Exs. 23, 30, and March 1984 HearingTranscript, p. 496). Therefore, paragraph (j)(1)(vii) specifies that suchsteps need be continued only until the gas concentration is reduced toless than five percent LEL unless the employer is operating in accordancewith the ``potentially gassy'' or the ``gassy'' operation requirements.OSHA has revised paragraph (j)(2) to include additional air monitoringrequirements for both ``potentially gassy'' and ``gassy'' operations. Thisparagraph refers to the criteria that now appear in paragraph (h) pertainingto the classification of potentially gassy and gassy operations. Paragraphs(j)(2) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are substantively the same requirementsas those proposed for gassy operations alone.Paragraph (j)(2)(iii), like proposed (j)(2)(ii), requires a manual flammablegas monitor to be used as needed. OSHA received testimony that, at a minimum,all air quality testing should be performed at the beginning and mid-pointof each shift (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 172). Although OSHA doesnot believe that this is necessary at all underground construction operations(for example, at those which have never tested positive for flammable gas),OSHA believes that this twice-per-shift minimum is warranted in ``potentiallygassy'' and ``gassy'' operations. Clearly, the increased risk of fire andexplosion in these operations warrants the increased frequency of air monitoringover that required in non-gassy operations. Consequently, the Final Rulerequires gas tests at the beginning and mid-point of each shift for ``potentiallygassy'' and ``gassy'' operations at paragraph (j)(2)(iii).OSHA proposed, in paragraph (j)(1)(xi), to require monitoring for flammablegas prior to re-entry after blasting for all drill and blast operations.Granite Construction (Ex. 17-24) commented that depending on such factorsas the nature of the ground, geology, and history, it would not alwaysbe necessary to test for flammable gas or petroleum vapor after each blast.Granite Construction also pointed out that in California, this requirementonly applies to gassy tunnels. OSHA concurs and has revised paragraph (j)(2)(v)to require additional monitoring for flammable gas during drill and blastoperations only in ``potentially gassy'' and ``gassy'' environments.OSHA proposed in paragraph (j)(3) to continue the current requirement,at andSection; 1926.800(c)(1)(i), for maintaining records of air qualitytests, but left open the appropriate retention period for such records(48 FR 35789). OSHA stated that andSection; 1910.20 currently requires atleast a 30-year retention period, unless a specific standard provides adifferent period of retention period for records required by proposed paragraph(j)(3). OSHA received several comments on this requirement. For example,Mr. Robert Lange, representing Fenix and Scisson, Inc. (Ex. 17-20), statedthat recordkeeping for air quality testing should be maintained for onlythree years completion of the job, not 30 years as required for toxic chemicals.Kenny Construction (Ex. 17-21A) contended that testing records are usefulin investigating the cause of problems which occur during construction,but are not useful after the project has been completed. Mr. Bruce Summers,Granite Construction Co., stated that there is no need to specify any periodof time for retention of air quality test records at the worksite. Mr.Summers added that records of employee exposure to toxic substances areaddressed in OSHA's ``Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records''standard. That standard, at andSection; 1910.20(d)(1)(ii), provides thateach ``employee exposure record'' shall be preserved and maintained forat least 30 years. Mr. John Dyer, with the Southern California Rapid TransitDistrict (Ex. 17-28), endorsed a 30-year retention requirement for recordsregarding chemicals whose toxicity can persist; in contrast, he contendedthat records of flammable atmosphere tests need not be kept for 30 yearsbecause conditions after construction do not pose a health hazard.OSHA also received comment that petroleum vapors are toxic as well as flammable.It was pointed out that since the permissible exposure levels for thesehydrocarbon compounds are ten to twenty times lower than their lower explosivelimit, it is hardly worthwhile to segregate records of toxic vs. flammableatmospheres (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 355, and Ex. 17-16).Based on the above comments, the provision has been revised to requirethat only records of exposures to toxic substances be retained for 30 years,and that all other air quality records be retained only until the projecthas been completed.Paragraph (k)_VentilationThis paragraph contains the requirements pertaining to ventilation of theunderground atmosphere. The importance of an effective ventilation systemwas cited repeatedly by commenters as probably the key factor in controllingair contaminants that are encountered during underground construction.Thus, for example, the Bureau of Reclamation insists that the ventilationsystem be adequately designed and then approved even before the Bureaupermits the contractor to go underground (March 1984 Hearing Transcript,pp. 123-124).Paragraph (k)(1)(i), derived from proposed paragraph (k)(2)(ii), prescribesin general performance language that fresh air must be supplied in sufficientquantities to prevent dangerous or harmful accumulation of dusts, fumes,vapors or gases in all underground work areas. The proposal specified thatmechanical ventilation was required when natural ventilation failed toprovide the required air quality and flow. Three commenters recommendedthat OSHA require mechanical ventilation and not permit reliance upon naturalventilation (Exs. 17-1, 17-14, and 17-17). However, these commenters didnot provide sufficient rationale to support why natural ventilation shouldbe prohibited in all cases. Therefore, OSHA has required, in Final Ruleparagraph (k)(1)(ii), that mechanical ventilation be used except wherenatural ventilation provides the necessary air quality.Paragraph (k)(3) is a revision of proposed paragraph (k)(2)(i), which requiredat least 30 feet per minute (fpm) airflow in the tunnel bore, shafts, andall other unsealed underground work areas. The current standard, at andSection;1926.800(c)(2)(v), requires not less than 30 fpm where blasting or rockdrilling is conducted or where conditions are present that are likely toproduce dust, fumes, vapors, or gases in harmful or explosive quantities.Mr. C.R. Mattson, with the Perini Corporation (Ex. 17-23), stated thatthe present standard is sufficient. Kenny Construction Company (Ex. 17-21A)stated that the proposal was too broad because only active work areas needventilation. Mr. Robert Lange, with Fenix and Scisson, Inc., stated thatusing the term ``unsealed areas'' does not suit some mining methods, andsuggested ``in all areas where workers are regularly required to work''as an alternative. Mr. W.R. Bristol, with CAL/OSHA (Ex. 17-1), stated that30 fpm is inadequate, especially when diesel equipment is operating inthe tunnel. Mr. Bruce Summers, with Granite Construction Company (Ex. 17-24),stated that the air-flow should be whatever is necessary to maintain theproper quantity of clean air at the workplace. Based on the record, OSHAhas concluded that the language in the current standard best expressesthe employer's duty to provide a sufficient velocity of clean air in undergroundwork areas. OSHA also notes that where mobile diesel equipment is usedunderground, additional ventilation may be necessary to maintain adequateair quality (see the discussion below concerning paragraph (k)(10)(ii)).OSHA's current standard, at andSection; 1926.800(c)(2)(i), requires mechanicalventilation in all work areas and also that the direction of airflow bereversible. OSHA proposed to add a requirement that the air flow be reversiblefrom above-ground controls (see proposed paragraph (k)(2)(iii)). In theproposal, OSHA cited three other standards that require reversibility ofmechanical air flow (48 FR 35790). OSHA has re-examined these standardsand has found that only CAL/OSHA requires that the main ventilation systembe arranged so that air flow can be reversed from the surface, and onlyif a fire or some emergency makes this advisable (emphasis added) (California8437(b)). The other two standards (ANSI's and Michigan's) do not addressthe location of ventilation controls. Therefore, paragraph (k)(4) retainsthe current requirement that mechanical ventilation be reversible, butdoes not prescribe that all mechanical ventilation systems used in undergroundconstruction operations be provided with controls located above ground.OSHA has concluded that above-ground controls are warranted only in thecase of ``gassy'' operations (see the discussion below concerning paragraph(k)(12)).Paragraph (k)(5) of the final rule explicitly requires that after blasting,the employer must exhaust smoke and fumes to the outside atmosphere beforework underground is resumed. This new provision is being added to provideprotection to employees who must enter the underground worksite after blasting(see explanation of proposed paragraph (k)(2)(iii) at 48 FR 35790.)OSHA proposed, in paragraph (k)(7)(ii), to continue the current requirementfor mobile diesel-powered equipment to be approved by MSHA in accordancewith 30 CFR Part 32, formerly commonly referred to as ``Schedule 24.''In addition, OSHA proposed to allow the use of mobile diesel-powered equipmentthat is equivalent in all respects to MSHA-approved equipment. This proposedallowance was made to permit the use of equipment that, although it hadnot been officially approved by MSHA, had been determined by the employer,the manufacturer or a qualified third party to have met the criteria containedwithin 30 CFR Part 32 (see 40 FR 35791).Several commenters objected to the incorporation by reference of 30 CFRPart 32, arguing that MSHA certification and approval is a complicatedand time-consuming process. Instead, they urged that OSHA promulgate performancestandards prescribing air quality requirements (see, for example, Ex. 17-21Aand Ex. 17-24). OSHA has carefully reviewed 30 CFR Part 32, which coverssuch topics as cooling the exhaust gases, fuel supply system safety, electricalsystem safety, and ventilation requirements, in addition to the compositionof exhaust gas. Mr. Joseph Hadden, with MSHA, stated that 30 CFR Part 32was developed through significant research and effort and he did not believethat OSHA needed to duplicate that research and effort to develop independentlynew standards governing the design and use of diesel-powered equipmentunderground (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 169). 30 CFR Part 32 isalso the nationally recognized standard for underground diesel equipment:OSHA's current standard, at andSection; 1926.800(c)(2)(vii), has for yearsincorporated Schedule 24, and both the ANSI A10.16 and Michigan standardsalso contain this reference. Moreover, the MSHA standards are widely recognizedby the underground equipment industry and are widely available to any interestedperson through either OSHA or MSHA. Finally, 30 CFR Part 32 is comprehensivein its requirements: OSHA believes that air quality performance standardsalone would not provide a level of safety comparable with that providedby 30 CFR Part 32 at this time. Therefore, reference to 30 CFR Part 32has been retained in paragraph (k)(10)(ii), governing use of mobile dieselpowered equipment underground in other-than-``gassy'' conditions. (Theuse of mobile diesel-powered equipment underground in ``gassy'' conditionsis governed by paragraph (i)(2), which incorporates by reference the MSHArequirements in 30 CFR Part 36.).OSHA solicited comments on the use of water scrubbers and catalytic converters(see 48 FR 35791) and received numerous comments that supported both typesof exhaust conditioners (see, for example, Exs. 17-4, 17-13, 17-20, 17-21,17-23, 17-24). In addition, documentation was submitted to the record toshow that catalytic converters have been successfully used on diesel-poweredequipment approved under 30 CFR, Part 32 (Exs. 36 and 41). In his openingstatement at the hearings, Mr. Barry White, Director of OSHA's Safety StandardsPrograms, explained that OSHA will allow the use of any equipment thatcan be shown to meet the approval criteria contained in 30 CFR Part 32,regardless of the type of exhaust conditioner used to meet those criteria.The debate over water scrubbers versus catalytic converters is unimportantat this time, since equipment with both types of exhaust conditioning havebeen approved by MSHA under 30 CFR Part 32, and are therefore acceptableto OSHA.OSHA received two comments pertaining to the note that accompanied proposedparagraph (k)(8). The note indicated that diesel engines need at least100 cubic feet of air per minute for each brake horsepower, in additionto the volume of air supplied to personnel. The National Utility ContractorsAssociation stated that where several pieces of equipment are on the jobat the same time, an adjustment to the amount of air per brake horsepowershould be made, i.e., 100 percent of 100 cubic feet per minute (cfm) perbrake horsepower for the first machine; 75 percent for the second machine;and 50 percent for each successive machine (Ex. 31, pp. 43-45). The J.F. Shea Company also suggested this declining percentage (Ex. 4). Neitherof these comments contained specific evidence that such a formula providedadequate ventilation.In this regard it should be noted that in the MSHA rules in 30 CFR Part32, andSection; 32.9 provides that if more than one unit is used at a givenlocation, or in any continuous course of air, then the rate of ventilationshould be the sum of the requirements for the individual units. Therefore,OSHA has decided to retain the note which accompanied proposed paragraph(k)(8), and will rely on the amount of ventilation determined in accordancewith the tests prescribed in 30 CFR Part 32.Final rule paragraph (k)(11), a revision of proposed paragraph (u)(7),requires specific design criteria for ventilation systems used in ``potentiallygassy,'' as well as ``gassy'' operations. The inclusion of ``potentiallygassy'' classification in this paragraph was necessitated by the additionof the new ``potentially gassy'' classification in the standard. OSHA hasalso incorporated in paragraph (k)(11) the requirement proposed in paragraph(u)(2) that only acceptable equipment be used in a ``gassy'' operations;the rule now specifies that the electrical systems, including the fan motors,must be acceptable.OSHA proposed, in paragraph (k)(2)(iii), to require above-ground controlsfor reversing mechanical airflow at all underground construction operations.The Final Rule, in paragraph (k)(13), has been revised so that above-groundcontrols for reversing the direction of mechanical airflow are requiredonly in gassy operations.Kenny Construction argued that connecting the in-line booster fans to acentral above-ground control will require the installation of a burdensomewiring and switch system which is unjustified, absent some compelling needfor surface control (Ex. 31, p. 54). Mr. Vinton Garbesi contended thatabove-ground reversing mechanisms for tunnel ventilation systems are neitherpractical nor safety beneficial (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 190).Mr. Ronald Searle testified that the Bureau of Reclamation requires above-groundcontrols for all underground operations. Mr. Searle stated that in casean evacuation of the underground becomes necessary, the ventilation systemcan be controlled from the surface (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 124).Mr. Searle also stated that ventilation control by above-ground rescuecrews is critical, adding that controlling underground atmospheres is essentialto expediting rescue operations (Ex. 24, p. 4).The sole evidence cited in the Proposal, at 48 FR 35790, in support ofthe proposed requirement at (k)(2)(iii) that the direction of mechanicalventilation be reversible by above-ground controls was ANSI, Michigan,and CAL/OSHA. But ANSI and Michigan do not require above-ground controls.Only CAL-OSHA calls for above-ground controls, and only if a fire or emergencymakes this advisable (see 8437(b)). However, in light of Mr. Searle's testimonyabout the value of above-ground controls for control from the surface afterevacuation and during rescue work (March 1984 Hearing, pp. 124-125), andthe requirements of the CAL/OSHA rule, OSHA believes that the record doessupport a decision to require above-ground controls in operations wheresuch events are most likely to occur, that is, in ``gassy'' operations.Therefore, OSHA promulgates Final Rule paragraph (k)(12) as revised.OSHA proposed, in paragraph (u)(7), that ventilation systems used in gassyoperations be provided with explosion-relief mechanisms. No substantivecomments were submitted on this provision. However, the August 1985 ``SummaryReport of Compliance Cost Estimates Pertaining to Permissible Ventilationand Gassy Tunnels'' (Ex. 54) by the contractor JRB/SAIC questioned thefeasibility of explosion-relief mechanisms in the typical single-bore tunnelventilation system. That report also correctly cited 30 CFR 57.21-20(e),an MSHA ventilation requirement pertaining to gassy mines, as the sourcefor OSHA's proposed rule. None of the comments received in response tothe limited reopening of the record (50 FR 33357) provided OSHA with anyinformation on this issue. OSHA believes that the JRB/SAIC report raisesserious questions about the feasibility of this provision, and has thereforemodified the proposed requirement to delete coverage of the typical single-boretunnel ventilation system. The final rule uses language similar to thatof the mining rule to provide coverage of those few underground constructionoperations that use mine-type ventilation systems with offset surface fansso as to maintain ventilation during an explosion.Paragraph (l) IlluminationOSHA proposed, in paragraph (l)(1) and Table D-3 of andSection; 1926.56,to revise the minimum level of illumination (see 48 FR 35791-35792). Currently,paragraph (d) of andSection; 1926.800 requires five footcandles in generalwork areas, and ten footcandles at the heading during drilling, mucking,and scaling operations. Several commenters recommended that OSHA retainthe currently required levels of illumination (Exs. 17-12, 17-17, 17-24).In general, the rationale presented by these comments was that the undergroundenvironment is wet, dirty, and slippery and that poor lighting conditionsexaggerate such hazards. OSHA believes that the record does not supportthe proposed minimum levels of illumination. Therefore, OSHA has decidedto retain the current levels of illumination and has not revised TableD-3 of andSection; 1926.56 of this Part.Paragraph (l)(2) proposed that acceptable portable lighting be used within50 feet of any underground heading during explosives handling. Some commentsurged that such lighting only be required where electric detonators areused (Exs. 17-1, 17-4, 21-A, 17-24). None of these comments, though, citedany authority to substantiate that their use would provide an adequatelevel of safety. OSHA consulted publications of the Institute of Makersof Explosives (IME). OSHA recognizes IME as an authoritative source onthe subject of safety with explosives and accords great weight to its recommendations.IME is the safety association of the commercial explosives industry inthe United States and Canada. Its member companies produce over 75 percentof the commercial explosives consumed in the United States each year. OSHAhas relied on IME guidelines in other OSHA standards (see for example 29CFR Part 1926, Subpart U). The IME Publication Number 17, ``Safety in theTransportation, Storage, Handling and Use of Explosive Materials,'' page3, states that ``where portable lights are needed around explosive materials,only approved electric flashlights or electric lanterns should be permitted.''The IME Publication Number 12, ``Glossary of Commercial Explosives IndustryTerms,'' page 14, defines Explosive Materials to include, but not be limitedto, dynamite and other high explosives; slurries, emulsions and water gels;black powder and pellet powder; initiating explosives; detonators (blastingcaps); safety fuse; squibs; detonating cord; igniting cord; and igniters.Therefore, the IME clearly intends the requirement for approved lightingto apply to all explosive materials, not just electric detonators.OSHA also notes that the Army Corps of Engineers requires that the loadingarea be illuminated by floodlights located 50 feet from the face. If additionalillumination is needed, the loading crew shall be provided with approvedhead lamps (see Ex. 14-2 at Rule 24.C.03). Therefore, in the Final Rule,OSHA has concluded that any lighting equipment used within 50 feet of theunderground heading during explosives handling must be of a portable typethat meets the definition of ``acceptable.''Paragraph (m) Fire Prevention and ControlOSHA proposed, in paragraph (m)(4)(ii), to prohibit piping diesel fuelfrom the surface to underground locations. OSHA explained that the purposewas to control a fuel source hazard arising from leaks from the pipe (see48 FR 35792-93). This proposal drew several comments, all critical of theproposal.Mr. Bruce Harvey, representing J. S. Redpath Corporation (Ex. 17-8), contendedthat diesel fuel can be transferred to an underground storage facilityusing a dry-line supply system without the hazards involved in transportingfuel containers. Mr. Harvey added that the pipe-line would be dry at alltimes except when actually transmitting diesel fuel.Mr. Vinton Garbesi, with S and M Constructors, Inc., testified that itis far safer to pipe diesel to a fueling station at the bottom of a shaftthan to transport fuel tanks in and out of the shaft. He recommended adry-type pipe with a transfer pump on the surface and two valves, one atthe surface and one at the fueling station (March 1984 Hearing Transcript,p. 191).Mr. Charles Kelso, Dillingham Construction Company, argued that pipingdiesel fuel is an efficient, economical and safe way of handling fuel.Mr. Kelso testified that hoisting 55-gallon drums up and down a shaft wouldexpose them to greater risk of damage and subsequent leaks, consequentlycreating greater hazards than would a dry-line supply system (March 1984Hearing Transcript, p. 679).Mr. E. O. Mixon described a dry-pipe system typically used by Kenny ConstructionCompany (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 519-520). When a piece of equipmentunderground needs fuel, a top man fills a small (50 to 100 gallon) tanklocated at the shaft collar from a 15,000-20,000 gallon storage tank alsoon the surface. The bottom man uses a service-station type nozzle to fillthe equipment fuel tank, and the top man controls a valve at the shaftcollar tank. If something goes awry, at worst the fuel leak to the undergroundis 50 to 100 gallons, not 15,000 to 20,000 gallons. The 50 to 100 gallonsis also less than the typical one-day's supply of underground storage thatis currently permitted under andSection; 1926.800(e)(1)(iv).OSHA sees merit in these comments and has determined that the record supportsthe use of a dry-line supply system which incorporates many of the componentscited in the comments (see, for example, Exs. 17-8, 17-20, 17-21A, and17-35). OSHA believes that compliance with all the requirements containedin paragraph (m)(4) of this Final Rule will effectively control the hazardsand points of possible failure associated with a pipe-line system.OSHA proposed, in paragraph (m)(5)(ii), to allow the use of acetylene,liquified petroleum gas (LP-Gas) and Methylacetylene Propadiene Stabilized(MPS) gas underground only for welding, cutting and hot work. The existingtunnel standard, at andSection; 1926.800(e)(1)(v), prohibits LP-Gas underground.However, Subpart J_Welding and Cutting, of the OSHA Construction Standardscontained in 29 CFR Part 1926, permits the underground use of fuel gases,including LP-Gas, under prescribed conditions, including handling, storageand ventilation requirements (see 48 FR 35793). In an effort to clarifythis contradiction in its standards, OSHA published OSHA Instruction STD3-17.1 in November 1976, which allowed fuel gases, including LP-Gas, tobe used underground.Kenny Construction opposed the use of LP-Gas underground because of itsvolatility, alluding to an ``unfortunate experience'' that they had experienced(Ex. 21). Mr. Dan McAuliffe, testifying for the International Union ofOperating Engineers, stated that MPS gas is stored in thinner walled containersthan acetylene and should not be used (March 1984 Transcript, p. 727).OSHA's requirements that apply to all fuel gas welding and cutting in construction(29 CFR 1926.350) require that all cylinders meet the Department of Transportation(DOT) requirements published in 49 CFR Part 178, Subpart C, ``Specificationfor Cylinders.'' These rules, which specify the cylinder wall thicknessesdetermined to be safe for the storage of each compressed gas, have longbeen the recognized industry standard.  OSHA has weighed these comments carefully and finds the evidence insufficientto warrant changing the proposal. OSHA believes that the risks that maybe associated with the use of fuel gases will continue to be effectivelycontrolled by compliance with the paragraphs referred to in the rule; namely,29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart J and paragraphs (j), (k), (m) and (n) of thissection.  OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (m)(7). OSHA proposed that where itis not feasible to maintain a 100 foot separation between flammable orcombustible materials stored above ground and the opening to any undergroundoperation, a one hour fire-rated barrier must be placed between the flammable/combustiblematerial and the opening. The intent was to prevent fire and explosionhazards at the surface opening from endangering employees underground (see48 FR 35793).  Mr. Mark Hoffman, with Stimm-Fitzpatrick Constructors, asserted that thereis insufficient space at some sites to maintain a 100-foot separation (Ex.17-26). He also argued that such a barrier would not contain smoke andmight create a visibility problem. Mr. Hoffman added that if no flammablematerials is used in the shaft, such a barrier would be ineffective. Hesuggested that if combustible or flammable materials or supplies are storedin close proximity to the opening, adequate and clearly marked fire protectionequipment should be provided.  OSHA believes that a barrier will both keep the fire and heat away fromany access opening to the underground, and enable employees to evacuatethe work area. Therefore, OSHA has concluded that the barrier will enhanceemployee safety, even though a barrier would not contain the smoke froma surface fire. Obviously, the best course would be to prevent the firefrom occurring in the first place. In addition, OSHA has deleted from theFinal Rule a redundant reference to 29 CFR 1926.152(c): Paragraph (m) alreadycontains a reference to the fire protection requirements covered in SubpartF.  Paragraph (n) Welding, Cutting and Hot Work  Proposed paragraph (n)(1) was deleted from this Final Rule because it wasredundant to the final provision in paragraph (j)(1)(iii)(B) that requiresthe competent person to consider the use of fuel gases and welding, cuttingand hot work operations when making the determination for air monitoring.Two commenters interpreted the proposal as requiring additional air monitoring,even if no gas was present (Exs. 17-19, 17-21A), but this was not OSHA'sintent. For example, if compliance with the monitoring requirements ofparagraph (j) indicated there was no reason to believe that the air shouldbe monitored immediately prior to starting the hot work, and if the competentperson had no reason to suspect that the cylinders could be leaking, thenthe competent person might have sufficient information to support the determinationwithout additional air monitoring.  OSHA proposed in paragraph (n)(2) to limit the number of compressed gascylinders underground to a one-shift supply. The commenters acknowledgedthat it is sound safety practice to limit the amount of cylinders underground,but argued that a one-shift limit was unnecessarily stringent. For example,Mr. Mark Hoffman, with Stimm-Fitzpatrick Constructors, stated that themore trips required to carry the cylinders, the more risk was involved(Ex. 17-26). Mr. Vinton Garbesi, with S and M Construction, Inc., statedthat, in his experience, accidents involving compressed gas cylinders havegenerally occurred while they were being transported, and that the proposalwould increase the frequency of transportation (March 1984 Hearing Transcript,pp. 191, 192, and 213). As a result of these comments, OSHA is persuadedof the need to reduce the handling of cylinders, as well as to limit thenumber of cylinders. Therefore, OSHA has increased the amount of fuel gasand oxygen that is permitted underground from the proposed one-shift limit;the Final Rule permits a 24-hour supply. OSHA believes that the 24-hourcriterion represents an appropriate balance of reducing handling risks,and minimizing the amount of compressed gas stored underground. It mustalso be remembered that in all other respects, the regulations in 29 CFR1926.350 pertaining to transporting and storing of compressed gas cylindersalso apply to underground construction.  Paragraph (o) Ground Support  Proposed paragraph (o)(2)(iv) drew several comments pertaining to the varietyof bolts in use (Exs. 17-8, 17-21A). For example, Mr. Garbesi noted thatthe proposed rule overlooked the fact that some rock bolts and dowels donot depend on torsionally applied force, such as split-set stabilizersbolts, and post-tension grouted bolts (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p.192). Therefore, the Final Rule, renumbered as final paragraph (o)(3)(iv)(A),provides that a torque wrench is to be used only if the bolt depends ontorsionally-applied force.  Proposed paragraph (o)(2)(v) would have required the employer to maintainthe torque bolt tension assignments at the jobsite. OSHA received no substantivecomments on this proposed requirement. However, because paragraph (o)(3)(iv)(B)requires a competent person to determine that the bolts are properly torqued,OSHA does not believe that a record of tension assignments would improvethe protection provided by the standard.  Several comments were received regarding paragraph (o)(2)(vi)_renumberedas final paragraph (o)(3)(v)_concerning ``temporary roof supports.'' Theproposed rule, derived from California section 8441.(e), provided for temporaryroof supports to protect employees who are either working beyond or installingpermanent roof supports. One commenter, Mr. Bruce Summers, with GraniteConstruction, stated that temporary roof supports are frequently retainedas permanent roof supports (Ex. 17-24). Both Mr. Summers and Mr. Brown,representing J.F. Shea Co., Inc. (Ex 17-4), recommended that OSHA adoptthe CAL-OSHA rule, from which OSHA's proposed language was derived. OSHAagrees that the performance-oriented CAL-OSHA provision, allowing any effectivemethod of protection, expresses the intended purpose more clearly thanthe proposal without diminishing employee safety, and has revised the standardaccordingly.  Proposed paragraph (o)(3)(ii)(B)_paragraph (o)(4)(ii)(B) in the Final Rule_hasbeen revised in response to comments asserting that the proposed 42-inchcasing height is too restrictive (Exs. 17-4, 17-19, 17-24, 17-28). Forexample, Mr. John Dyer, with the Southern California Rapid Transit District,conceded the need for a barrier to prevent tripping and falling into theshaft, but questioned the need for the casing to be extended to 42 inches(Ex. 17-28). Mr. L.W. Brown, with J.F. Shea Company, Inc., stated thatthe objectives of the proposed 42-inch casing height are appropriate (see48 FR 35795), but that the regulation should be performance-oriented toallow the employer other compliance options (Ex. 17-4). OSHA notes thatANSI A10.16-1981, paragraph 4.7, requires shafts to be guarded by meansof a standard guardrail or a tight covering (see Ex. 13). Therefore, OSHAhas determined to retain the 12-inch casing height in the existing standard,at andSection; 1926.800(h)(3)(ii), provided that a standard (42-inch) railingis used; that the ground is sloped so as to prevent liquids from runningover the 12-inch high casing; and that barriers are used to prevent mobileequipment from jumping over the 12-inch high casing. This system will provideequivalent protection to the proposed requirement.  Paragraph (p) Blasting  The Final Rule indicates a new requirement, in paragraph (p)(2), to makeexplicit what was implicit in the proposal: That employees shall not entera work area until air quality meets minimum requirements. In New York,in 1980, three men entered an underground area after a blast without checkingair quality; all three were killed by poisonous fumes (Ex. 31, App. 3,p. 13). The addition here reiterates the intent expressed elsewhere inthe standard, such as at paragraphs (j)(2)(v) and (k)(5).  Paragraph (q) Drilling  The current standard, at andSection; 1926.800(i)(8), requires the employerto provide mechanical means for lifting drills, roof bolts, mine straps,and other unwieldy heavy material to the top deck of jumbos over ten feetin height. Proposed paragraph (q)(8)(i) retained this requirement, butincreased the scope of the standard to the top decks of all jumbos, notjust those over ten feet in height. This revision was proposed becausethe current standard does not provide for mechanical assistance to employeeswho need it to lift heavy material to the top deck of a jumbo that is lessthan ten feet in height.  Mr. Vinton Garbesi, with S and M Construction, stated that the regulationshould require mechanical hoists or lifts on jumbos, but should leave thecircumstances of their use to be determined by the employer (March 1984Hearing Transcript, p. 193). Mr. Brown, with J.F. Shea Company, commentedthat a fairly typical roof bolt weighs 22 pounds and is not that unwieldy(Ex. 17-4). OSHA has determined that the list of examples of heavy or unwieldyobjects unnecessarily includes the types of roof bolts referred to by Mr.Brown. On the other hand, the list might not accurately illustrate theuniverse of materials intended to be included. OSHA agrees that the unwieldinessor heaviness of an object depends not only on its configuration, but alsoon its location and the conditions at the worksite. The list of examplesof heavy or unwieldy materials was not intended to be all inclusive. Further,if a list item such as a roof bolt was shown to be not ``heavy or unwieldy,''it would not require mechanical assistance. Accordingly, OSHA is deletingthe list of examples from this provision. Therefore, OSHA has concludedthat mechanical lifting means shall be provided on the top deck so thatpersonnel who need to lift any unwieldy or heavy materials will have mechanicalassistance, if needed, regardless of the height of the jumbo.    Paragraph (q)(8)(ii) retains the requirement under the existing standard,at andSection;1926.800(i)(9), that jumbos over 10 feet in height have stairswide enough for two persons. Several commenters, including Kenny Constructionand S and M Constructors, Inc. (Exs. 17-21A, 26), contended that the ruleis unnecessary and that the cost of providing two-person-wide stairs wouldbe significant. Nevertheless, the existing standard reflects OSHA's beliefthat, even though this width may not be necessary for routine access, itwould facilitate a rapid evacuation from the deck, or the transport ofan injured employee on a stretcher from the deck to the tunnel floor. Boththe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan OSHA standards containthis requirement. In addition, because the requirement has been in effectfor some years already, this aspect of the revised standards will not causeemployers to incur new costs to come into compliance. Accordingly, therecord does not provide a compelling basis for altering the current standard.   Proposed andSection;1926.800(q)(8)(iv)(A) retained the requirement of currentparagraph (i)(12), that only employees assisting the operator shall beallowed to ride on jumbos. Mr. Gail Knight, with S. A. Healy Company, statedthat a blanket restriction is unjustified; that it is often necessary totransport workers on jumbos, and if additional protection is desired, contractorsshould equip jumbos with seats or handles (Ex. 21-13, p. 10). OSHA hasreexamined the record and sees no reason why employees other than thoseassisting the operator should not be allowed to ride a jumbo, providedthat suitable protection is provided for such riders. Therefore, paragraph(q)(8)(iv)(A) has been revised to allow employees to ride jumbos providedthat the jumbo is equipped to allow those employees to ride safely as prescribedin paragraph (r)(6)(ii).   OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (q)(10)(i) to remove a redundant requirement,and also to clarify the intent of the rule. The first sentence of the proposalrequired an examination for and removal of any misfired charges prior todrilling. This same requirement appears in Subpart U at andSection;1926.910and andSection;1926.911 and need not be repeated here.  The second sentence of proposed paragraph (q)(10)(i) prohibited drillingblasting holes through muck or water. Mr. Garbei stated that most holesin the invert of tunnels are drilled through muck or water. Garbesi acknowledgedthe need to inspect for and remove misfires. However, OSHA maintains thatdrilling through muck or water is an unsafe practice, even if an inspectionis performed, because of the inherent difficulty of assuring that all misfireshave been located and removed. Therefore, OSHA promulgates this paragraphas proposed, continuing the existing requirement.Paragraph (r) Haulage   Paragraph (r)(2) has been revised to increase safety by ensuring that haulageequipment can be stopped even if the brakes alone are not effective. Mr.Dan McAuliffe, with the International Union of Operating Engineers, statedthat under certain conditions, including slope, moisture and temperature,brakes may not be adequate to stop equipment, and he recommended that ``sanders''be required (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, pp. 727-728). There is no datain the record to support specific slope or temperature limits. Therefore,OSHA has expressed the requirement using performance-oriented language.If conditions are such that suitable brakes alone are not effective, thensanders or some other means may be used to provide an effective means ofstopping. This clarification is consistent with the intent of the proposedrule (see 48 FR 35796).   Proposed paragraph (r)(4)(i) would have required Falling Object ProtectiveStructures (FOPS) on all powered mobile haulage equipment. This provisionhas not been carried forward into the Final Rule, primarily for feasibilityand safety considerations. For example, S and M Constructors, Inc., contendedthat the regulation should be modified to recognize that in small diametertunnels the incorporation of FOPS into conventionally designed locomotivesis ``dimensionally'' not possible while maintaining the operator's fieldof view to allow safe operation of the locomotive (Ex. 21-1).   Mr. E. O. Mixon, with Kenny Construction Company, contended that FOPS wouldcompound the restricted clearances of most tunnels (Ex. 17-21). In addition,Mr. Mixon argues that locomotive operators have no need for more protectionfrom falling objects than anyone else working underground, and that thenext logical extension of this rule would require FOPS for everybody underground.Mr. Bruce F. Harvey, with J. S. Redpath Corporation, recommended that OSHArequire overhead protection on manhaul cars only (Ex. 17-8).   In addition to the feasibility concerns associated with FOPS, it was statedthat FOPS may be unnecessary in some ground conditions. Michael F. Duffy,of the American Mining Congress, states that the ground support requirementsmay negate the need to provide FOPS (Ex. 21-11). Mr. Duffy added that inmany underground metal-nonmetal mines where stable roof conditions prevail,FOPS are not necessary and are not required by MSHA.   OSHA stated in the proposal at 48 FR 35796 that the same hazard exist formachines used underground as for those used above ground. Since machinesused above-ground do not have the benefit of operating within an environmentcontrolled by the ground control requirements of paragraph (o), the Agencyno longer sees the need for FOPS underground. Thus, OSHA has not carriedthe proposed FOPS requirement forward into this Final Rule.   OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (r)(6)(ii) to clarify the exceptionfor train crewmen. OSHA explained, in 48 FR 35797, that the rule was notintended to apply to train crewmen standing on properly designed platformswith suitable handholds, but did not state the exception explicitly inthe proposed rule. OSHA has added a requirement for a safe place for traincrewmen who ride the locomotive.        Paragraph (r)(6)(ii) also carries forward a requirement for seating foreach passenger that protects passengers from being struck, crushed, orcaught between other equipment or surfaces. Two commenters objected (seeExs. 17-19 and 17-21(a)) to such seating being required in elevators andshaft conveyances; however, this provision is intended to apply only tohaulage equipment and not hoisting equipment. Therefore, OSHA has carriedforward this requirement from existing rules 29 CFR 1926.601(b)(8) and29 CFR 1926.800(k)(7).  The proposed new coupling requirements of paragraphs (r)(12) (i) through(iii) were intended to reduce the need for employees to reach between carsand locomotives, and to reduce the hazards of inadvertent uncoupling, resultingin runaway cars. OSHA solicited comments on the hazards associated withcoupling/uncoupling operations and with runaway cars (see 48 FR 35798). Kenny Construction Company stated that the proposed requirement for automaticcouplers would be ineffective in protecting employees from being caughtbetween cars since both manual and automatic couplers can require employeeexposure (Ex. 17-21A). OSHA concedes that the use of an automatic couplerwhich continues to expose employees to the hazards encountered during cleaning,aligning, and hooking/unhoooking operations would not accomplish the desiredrisk reduction.  Mr. Mixon, with Kenny Construction, also pointed out that unit trains usedwith tunnel boring machines (TBMs) are seldom uncoupled (March 1984 HearingTranscript, p. 438). Mr. Knight, with S. A. Healy Company, testified thathis employer uses unit trains with cars pinned solidly together and neveruncouple them. Mr. Knight added that putting couplings on those cars wouldincrease the risk to workers due to the cars' tendency to become uncoupledunder certain conditions (March 1984 Transcript, p. 262).  Several commenters suggested a performance rule that would keep employeesfrom between the cars and allow the employer to chose the method of coupling,such as releasing levers, chains or rods (see, for example, March 1984Hearing Transcript, pp. 32-33, pp. 514-515). Mr. Ronald J. Searle, withthe Bureau of Reclamation, testified that he would like to keep the brakemenfrom between the cars, and recommended that engines and cars be equippedwith automatic couplers or handles for pulling coupler pins (March 1984Transcript, p. 137-139).  OSHA has reexamined the state and Federal standards cited at 48 FR 35798and found that all require automatic couplers. However, in addition, somehave work practice rules to further reduce the risk to employees. For example,CAL/OSHA prohibits employees from shifting or lining up couplings on movingcars or locomotives (see CAL/OSHA rule 8474(b)). <T3>Bulletin 644-Tunneling: Recommended Safety Rules, </T3>published in1968 by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, states that persons should not go betweencars unless the train is stopped, the motorman is notified and the noticeis acknowledged (Ex. 12-34, p. 17). MSHA 57.9-51 contains that same requirement(Ex. 14-3). <T3>Bulletin 644 </T3>also contains a rule that trains be brought to acomplete stop before cars are coupled or uncoupled, unless the cars areequipped with automatic couplers (Ex. 12-34, p. 18). MSHA 57.9-97 requiresthat trains be brought to a complete stop, then moved very slowly whencoupling or uncoupling cars manually (Ex. 14-3).  After considering these comments and the record evidence, OSHA is convincedthat the proposed requirement for automatic couplers would not effectivelycontrol the hazards to which employees are exposed during coupling anduncoupling operations. Therefore, rather than merely requiring automaticcouplers on all cars, paragraph (r)(12)(i) offers the alternative of usingmanual couplers and bringing the car to a complete stop during couplingand uncoupling operations. In addition, paragraphs (r)(12) (ii) and (iii)of the final rule contain work practice rules modeled after those discussedabove, which incorporate safe work practices such as prohibiting employeesfrom reaching between moving cars.  OSHA proposed in paragraphs (r)(12) (ii) and (iii) requirements for safetychains to be used in addition to couplers for certain types of cars. Onecommenter, Mr. Audrain Weatherl, with the Laborers International Unionof North America, stated that he had seen many runaway trains and urgedthat a loaded train be attached by chains in addition to the normal coupling(March 1984 Hearing Transcript pp. 635-636). Another commenter, Mr. RonaldSearle, noted that the Bureau of Reclamation had successfully used safetychains to prevent serious accidents during derailment or accidental uncoupling.Mr. Searle added that safety chains were used with side or rotating dumpingequipment (Ex. 24). (However, OSHA notes that the Bureau of Reclamationregulations do not require such chains.)  OSHA believes that accidental uncoupling of man cars and of powder carsposes risk to employees (see 48 FR 35798) and, therefore, the Agency hasretained the proposed safety chain requirements. It has been renumberedas paragraph (r)(13)(i).  Mr. Vinton Garbesi, with S and M. Constructors, Inc., testified that theweight of a safety chain as strong as a coupler would make it too unwieldyand difficult to use. OSHA concurs that a safety chain as strong as thecoupler might be excessive to prevent runaway cars. Accordingly, OSHA hasdeleted the phrase ``of equivalent strength to the coupler.'' However,OSHA has replaced that term with the performance language of ``capableof maintaining connection between cars'' in Final Rule paragraph (r)(13)(iii). Several commenters objected to proposed paragraph (r)(12)(iii)'s requirementof safety chains on haulage cars when the grade exceeds one percent. Theyargued that such use of safety chains would be very expensive and mightbe unsafe.  For example, Mr. Mixon, of Kenny Construction, stated that compliance withthis provision could be very expensive because it would require two menper shift to service a rotary dumping mechanism. Each time a muck car wasto be inverted 180 degrees to be dumped, the chains would have to be disconnectedbetween cars. Mr. Mixon addded that when the train went back to the headagain, the cars would have to be disconnected and reconnected at that point(March 1984 Transcript, p. 406).      Mr. Vinton Garbesi, of S and M Constructors, Inc., stated that in his experience,safety chains on rail equipment are not safe to utilize in high-speed tunnelhaulage systems. He added that the coupling and uncoupling of the chainrequires employees constantly to place themselves between haulage units,and also that the chains are hazardous when allowed to swing unattachedon the end car of a haulage train. Mr. Garbesi recommended that the haulageregulation instruct the employer what has to be done in order to controla train on a grade. He added that this is usually done on steeper gradesby having the locomotive downhill of the train at all times (March 1984Hearing Transcript, p. 196). This suggestion was also endorsed by Mr. Mixonof Kenny Construction (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, pp. 440-441).No evidence was submitted into the record to refute Mssrs. Garbesi andMixon's recommendation of positioning the locomotive downhill of the train.OSHA believes that this is a feasible alternative that will be effectivein reducing the risk of runaway cars, and has modified paragraphs (r)(13)(i) and (ii) to allow positioning the locomotive downhill of the trainas an acceptable alternative to the use of safety chains.OSHA's intent is to apply the one percent criterion in final rule paragraph(r)(13)(ii) to the overall slope of the tunnel, but not to isolated areassuch as California switches. For example, if the overall job is flat, thenthere is no real potential for runaway cars and no safety chains wouldbe required for haulage cars, even though the slope on the California switchmight exceed one percent. OSHA has clarified the rule by adding the phrasepertaining to the existence of potential for runaway cars.OSHA proposed in paragraph (r)(17)(i) that occupied man cars be pulledand not pushed. OSHA received comments that this new provision was notfeasible in all tunnels. For example, Mr. G.B. Knight, with S.A. HealyCompany, argued that this proposed rule was not feasible given the tightspace restrictions in tunnel construction which typically preclude switchingof cars (Ex. 21-13). OSHA notes that both ANSI A10.16-1981, paragraph 9.5.2,and CAL/OSHA 8473(a) require that man-cars shall be pulled, not pushed,by the locomotive, where switching facilities are available. In addition,ANSI has a supplemental precaution to follow when a personnel car mustbe pushed: Where switching is not available and personnel cars must bepushed, a qualified person must be stationed in the lead car to give signalsto the operator if the locomotive operator's vision of the track aheadis hampered. OSHA has, therefore, revised this provision so that paragraph(r)(18)(i) requires that occupied man cars be pulled and not pushed, whereswitching facilities are available.Paragraph (s) Electrical SafetyOSHA proposed in paragraph (s)(2) that electrical power lines be both insulatedand located away from other systems. In the preamble to the proposal, OSHAstated that the paragraph restated the existing requirements in andSection;1926.800 (1)(2) (see 48 FR 35799). It was subsequently pointed out thatthe existing requirement prescribes that powerlines shall be well separated<T3>or</T3> insulated from water lines, telephone lines, and air lines(Ex. 17-8). OSHA did not intend substantively to amend the existing requirement,and believes that either method can be effective. Both are not requiredtogether. However, if insulation alone is used, it must be kept free fromdamage which would create a hazard to employees, as prescribed by SubpartK of this Part.Paragraph (t) HoistingProposed paragraph (t) was much more comprehensive in addressing undergroundhoisting operations than the existing standard, at paragraph (m). The rationalefor the proposal was explained in 48 FR 35799-35807. OSHA has significantlyrevised this entire paragraph (t) to eliminate requirements that were redundantwith those current requirements in 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart N-Cranes,Derricks, Hoists, Elevators, and Conveyors; to rely on the recently published29 CFR 1926.550(g)_Crane or Derrick Suspended Personnel Platforms [53 FR29116]; and also to respond to numerous comments on the proposed rule.The following list contains those proposed requirements for cranes andhoists which are not brought forward into this Final Rule because thoserequirements are already covered by the existing standards in Subpart N.Proposal Paragraph Number:<ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(i)(A)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(i)(D)(</ITAG><T3>2</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(i)(F)(</ITAG><T3>4</T3>) (<T3>i</T3>) and (<T3>ii</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(ii)(</ITAG><T3>c</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(ii)(H)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(iii)(B)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(iii)(D)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(iii)(E)(</ITAG><T3>1</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(1)(iii)(F)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(2)(iii)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(4)(i)(A)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(t)(4)(ii)(D) (</ITAG><T3>1</T3>) and (<T3>2</T3>)The following list contains those proposed requirements which were to applyto cranes and hoists, but which have been modified in this Final Rule toapply only to hoists.

OSHAalso proposed to allow an employer to choose to comply with certain provisionsof Subpart N, or disregard that Subpart and comply with requirements in29 CFR 1926.800(t). The introduction to this Final Rule states that paragraph(t) applies in addition to the crane and hoist provisions in Subpart Nof this Part. OSHA has decided to rely on those existing standards andto include in paragraph (t) only those requirements necessary to modifythe general rules to address the unique concerns of underground construction.Paragraph (t)(1) of this Final Rule contains general provisions applicableto all underground construction hoisting operations performed by cranesand hoists.Final rule paragraph (t)(1)(iii) is a clarification of proposed paragraph(t)(1)(ii)(D)(<T3>2</T3>). Proposed paragraph (t)(1)(ii)(D)(<T3>1</T3>) provided that a hoistway that is not fully enclosed must usea flashing light to warn employees at the shaft bottom and subsurface shaftentrances that a load is being hoisted. Proposed paragraph (t)(1)(ii)(D)(<T3>2</T3>) also set forth a hoisting procedure to be followed when personnelare working in the shaft bottom. The prescribed hoisting procedure wasintended to apply to a hoistway that is not fully enclosed; clearly, employeesare not exposed to the hazard if the load is being lowered in a fully enclosedhoistway. Although the exclusion for full enclosed hoistways was explicitin proposed paragraph (t)(1)(ii)(D)(<T3>1</T3>) and was, OSHA believes, clearly implicit in proposed paragraph(t)(1)(ii)(D)(<T3>2</T3>), the Final Rule has been revised to make this exclusion explicitin paragraph (t)(1)(iii) as well.The two provisions of (t)(1) (ii) and (iii) adequately control the hazard,addressed by proposed paragraph (t)(1)(ii)(H), of passing equipment, toolsand material over personnel. Such hazards created by crane operations aregoverned by existing standards 29 CFR 1926.550(b)(2) and ANSI B30.5.OSHA proposed, in paragraphs (t)(1)(iii)(H) (<T3>1</T3>) and (<T3>2</T3>), to require a secondary bridle connection, capable of holding150 percent of the load, for cages and skips. This provision was to applyto all hoisting operations performed by cranes and hoists. Several commentswere unfavorable to this proposed requirement. For example, one commenter(Ex. 17-8) stated that this provision should not apply to shaft sinkingoperations where floating crossheads are used to guide the conveyancesor buckets, because the crosshead must be disengaged during dumping andwhen going through the stage area at the bottom of the shaft. Another commenter(Ex. 17-19) stated that wire rope clips for attaching safety bridles tohoist lines should not be permitted because they induce stress concentrationson the rope strands, and they create a condition for accelerated corrosionof the rope. In addition to these negative responses, OSHA notes that back-upbridles are not required by the current OSHA requirements for cranes andhoists. Consequently, OSHA believes the record does not support these proposedprovisions pertaining to secondary bridles, and they have not been carriedforward into this Final Rule.OSHA proposed two new requirements for cranes. The first requirement proposed,in paragraph (t)(3)(i), was for a line-out indicator on cranes used inunderground construction. Mr. G.B. Knight, with S.A. Healy Company (Ex.29), and Mr. John Kenny, Jr., with Kenny Construction Company (March 1984Hearing Transcript, pp. 467-470), stated that the hazards mentioned inthe proposal are effectively controlled by marking the wire rope for distanceand by communication between the operator and the signalman. The argumentwas also raised that a line-out indicator might divert the crane operator'sattention away from the signalman. Accordingly, OSHA has decided to deletethe proposed requirement for a line-out indicator because no supportingdata was submitted in response to OSHA's request at 48 FR 35805, and becausethe record does not refute the testimony submitted by Messrs. Knight andKenny.OSHA also proposed, in paragraph (t)(3)(ii), that a crane be equipped witha limit switch to prevent over-travel at the boom tip (commonly calledan anti-two-block device). Testimony presented jointly by the NationalUtility Contractors Association, the Underground Contractors Association,and Kenny Construction Company stated that they had no objection to theproposed requirement for a limit switch (Ex. 31, p. 31). Mr. M. Dumas,with Al Johnson Construction, contended that such a device can be difficultto maintain (Ex. 17-19). Mr. Bruce Summers, with Granite Construction,stated that the unreliability of such devices can create a more hazardouscondition than would be prevented by their use (Ex. 17-24). Mr. ThomasMcGeorge, with C and E Construction Company, stated that this is a gooddevice when it is working, and should be installed on all new cranes, althoughit is expensive to retrofit on some of the older cranes (Ex. 17-33). Mr.G. Knight, with S.A. Healy Company, stated that the minimal benefits ofsuch devices are not justified by the cost of retrofitting old cranes (Ex.29, p. 22).OSHA believes that maintenance is critical to the proper functioning ofany mechanical/electrical device. If these devices are maintained regularlyaccording to manufacturer's instructions, OSHA does not anticipate anygreater likelihood of faulty operation than with other similar equipment.OSHA has addressed one of the expressed concerns about limit switches byexplicitly forbidding the operator to use the safety device as an operationalcontrol. OSHA examined the costs and determined, based on the JRB report,that all cranes used in underground construction_new and old_could be equippedwith such devices without causing economic hardship (Ex. 11). Therefore,OSHA has decided that all cranes used in underground construction shallbe equipped with a limit switch to prevent two-blocking accidents. Thisnew requirement is found in paragraph (t)(2) of the Final Rule.Paragraph (t)(3) of this Final Rule contains requirements for hoists thatsupplement those contained in 29 CFR 1926.552. Additional rules that applyonly to personnel hoists are contained in paragraph (t)(4).Paragraph (t)(3)(i) requires the load hoist drum to be powered in bothdirections and the automatic application of brakes upon power release orfailure. This rule continues the current ``power down'' requirement forhoists in andSection; 1926.800(m)(1). This final rule is also derived fromtwo proposed paragraphs: andSection; 1926.800(t)(1)(i)(c) and andSection; 1926.800(t)(2)(i).OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (t)(1)(i)(c), which would have requiredpower-down drums on all cranes and hoists and prohibited ``free-wheeling''except for excavation using a clam-shell bucket. Commenters stated thatmany older friction-clutch types cranes lack this feature (Exs. 17-32 and17-33). In the recent OSHA rulemaking on Crane or Derrick Suspended PersonnelPlatforms, andSection; 1926.550(g) (OSHA Docket No. S-409), the Agency determinedthat power-down is necessary for employee safety when cranes are used tohoist personnel. As noted earlier, andSection; 1926.550(g) is being appliedto crane hoisting of personnel in underground construction. Because thepower-down requirement in andSection; 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(D) will provide protectionfor crane-hoisted personnel, the final underground construction standarditself does not contain such a provision.In the proposal (48 FR 35800, column 2) OSHA indicated that a power-downrequirement would also provide protection for employees in the hoistway(shaft) when cranes are used to hoist materials alone. However, OSHA hasdetermined that the final standard provides other adequate means for protectingemployees in the hoistway (see, e.g., paragraphs (t)(1) (i), (ii), and(iii)), and that power-down when using cranes to hoist materials is notnecessary for employee safety.OSHA had also proposed, in paragraph (t)(2)(i), that all cranes and hoistsused for personnel have power-down and an automatic-setting brake. Thisrule has been revised by deleting the reference to cranes, because, asnoted above, cranes used to hoist personnel are covered by 29 CFR 1926.550(g),which has this requirement. All hoists covered by andSection; 1926.800 havebeen required to have power-down (no ``free-wheeling'') and automatic brakessince 1971 and OSHA continues that requirement in final rule andSection;1926.800(t)(3)(i).Final rule andSection; 1926.800(t)(3)(ii) is derived from OSHA's currentparagraph (m)(2), which requires controls for powered hoists to be of the``deadman'' type with a non-locking switch or control. OSHA proposed, inparagraph (t)(1)(i)(B), that all cranes and hoists have ``deadman controls,''and stated that the intent of this rule is to assure that the hoist linedrum stops when the operator releases the control (see 48 FR 35800). OSHAcited BOR, ANSI, Michigan, and California standards as authority for arequirement for ``deadman controls'' on all cranes and hoists to supportthe proposed rule (48 FR 35800). Upon reexamination, OSHA has determinedthat these standards, like current paragraph (m)(2), apply to hoists, butnot to cranes. Therefore, the paragraph has been rewritten to address onlyhoists, and OSHA will rely on the current standards in andSection; 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(D) and (g)(3)(ii)(C) (53 FR 29123) to address cranes. In addition,OSHA has clarified its intent in the use of the term ``deadman controls''by requiring that control levers return automatically to their center (neutral)position upon release. The first sentence of proposed paragraph (t)(1)(i)(E)(<T3>1</T3>) required cranes and hoists used for both personnel and materialhoisting to be assigned a load rating for each purpose. The National UtilityContractors Association asked who would assign the dual ratings for cranesused to hoist materials and personnel (Ex. 31, pp. 32-33). In response,OSHA notes that the manufacturer of the crane assigns load ratings formaterial handling and publishes them on the load rating chart. As requiredby andSection; 1926.550(a)(1), employers must follow the manufacturer's assignedratings. However, when a crane is used to hoist personnel, which is notthe fundamental purpose of a crane, the employer must comply with the additionalload rating limitations and requirements in andSection; 1926.550 (g)(3)(i)(B)and (g)(3)(i)(F). Final Rule paragraph (t)(3)(iii) requires that, whena hoist is used both for hoisting personnel and for hoisting material,load and speed ratings must be assigned based on the specific use.The second sentence of proposed paragraph (t)(1)(i)(E)(1) is addressedin the Final Rule by (t)(3)(v) because it is related to the topic of thatparagraph_inspection and maintenance activities. Paragraph (t)(3)(v) issubstantively the same as proposed paragraph (t)(1)(ii)(E), but has beenclarified to avoid possible misunderstanding, and its application is limitedto hoists and not to cranes. OSHA stated in the proposal that the typeof inspection or service contemplated by the rule pertained to the railand guide system, and to lubricating sheaves on the block (see 48 FR 35801-02).For this type of work, the employee may remain on the top of the conveyance,provided the employee is secured by a body belt or harness system. OSHAbelieves that this is the only type of inspection or maintenance that necessitatesworking from the top of the conveyance.Final Rule paragraph (t)(3)(xiv) is a minor revision to proposed rule paragraph(t)(4)(i)(J). OSHA proposed to require a two-way closed circuit communicationsystem for hoist operators to communicate with landing stations. Mr. Harvey,with J. S. Redpath Corporation, stated that these type systems preventcommunication from other stations when in use (Ex. 17-8, p. 6). OSHA hastherefore revised this paragraph to delete the ``two-way'' specification.This will enable the operator to communicate with all other stations connectedto the closed circuit system.Paragraph (t)(1)(iv) of the proposal, requiring guides and safeties, didnot distinguish either between hoisting materials and hoisting of personnel,or between hoists and cranes. This resulted in two major difficulties inthe implementation of the proposed provision. First, many comments questionedthe feasibility of providing safeties that will stop and hold 150 percentof the weight of a fully loaded muck bucket. For example, Ronald J. Searle,of the Bureau of Reclamation, said ``It is very hard to provide protectionagainst a fully loaded muck bucket. If that [broken rope safeties] canbe provided, that is fine. But I would suspect that would not be feasible''(March 1984 Hearing Transcript, p. 153). Mr. John Coyle, of Kiewit Construction,said that in case the rope broke with a 25-ton muck bucket traveling at100 feet per minute, it would bring the whole shaft down (March 1984 HearingTranscript, p. 228).Second, comments also questioned the economic feasibility of providingboth guides and safeties for cranes. For example, Mr. Vinton Garbesi, ofS and M Constructors, Inc., stated that using shaft guides at depths greaterthan 75 feet will cause the employer to have to replace the cranes presentlyin use with hoists and guides, and also that having to operate with theguides during tunnel excavation would cause additional expenses. Mr. Garbesiadded that the cost of installing the guides as part of the productionphase in shaft sinking will also have a significant impact on the cost.Mr. Garbesi conservatively estimated a 25 to 40 percent increase in excavationcosts for shafts (Ex. 26).Although some commenters, such as Ronald Searle (March 1984 Hearing Transcript,pp. 140-149) and Don Brennan (March 1984 Hearing Transcript, pp. 273-291),stated that it is possible to use guides and safeties with cranes (i.e.,the cranes do not have to be replaced by hoists), the record shows thatthis can only be accomplished by effectively immobilizing the crane. NUCAconducted a detailed analysis of this alternative. Based upon an engineeringstudy conducted by the Elgood-Mayo Corporation, NUCA estimates that:<ITAG tagnum="21">One shaft would have incurred at least $191,230 additional directcosts due to guides and safeties. Furthermore, we estimate at least sixextra weeks in project duration to erect and disassemble the necessaryhead frame, shaft cover, etc. for each work site * * *. It should be stressedthat these figures are * * * for personnel mancages only. If we were toattempt to add extra costs for a guide and safety system for muckbuckets,assuming that such a system were possible, these costs would escalate dramatically* * * (Ex. 48).</ITAG>Based on these comments, OSHA has removed cranes from the scope of finalrule paragraphs (t)(3) (xv)-(xvii) and is only requiring guides for materialhoists. Guides and safeties are required for personnel hoists (see paragraph(t)(4)(vi)). OSHA believes that the costs associated with this revisedprovision will be negligible, based on the record evidence that guidesand safeties on hoists used for personnel hoisting are current industrypractice. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) A10.4-1963 requiresthe use of guides (andplusmin;4-11) and safeties (andplusmin;4-17) for workmen'shoists. In addition, the two sites visited by JRB that used hoists to carrypersonnel_sites seven and eight_both used guides and safeties. Site sevenhad four hoists all fitted with ``Canadian broken-rope safeties'' and siteeight had two hoists equipped with ``safety dogs'' (Ex. 11).OSHA proposed, in paragraph (t)(1)(iii)(A), a minimum safety factor offive for load lines on material hoists. OSHA did not receive substantivecomment to revise the factor of five, but was encouraged to no longer usethe term ``safety factor.'' MSHA stated the term ``safety factor'' hasgenerally been superseded by ``design factor.'' OSHA acknowledges thatthe hoisting and wire rope industries have generally replaced the term``safety factor'' with ``design factor.'' However, to be consistent withother recent rulemakings (see, for example, andSection; 1926.550(g)), OSHAhas used the phrase ``shall be capable of supporting, without failure atleast five times the maximum intended load'' in final rule paragraph (t)(3)(xviii),instead of the term ``design factor.''Proposed paragraph (t)(1)(iii)(B) required a wire rope safety factor often or more for personnel hoisting with cranes or hoists. OSHA has decidedto rely on the recently published standard on ``Crane or Derrick SuspendedPersonnel Platforms,'' andSection; 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(B). That paragraph requiresa design factor of seven (times the maximum intended load), except thatwhere rotation-resistant rope is used, the design factor shall be at leastten. MSHA recommended in 1984 that OSHA adopt the design factors containedin their Wire Rope Standards, 30 CFR Part 57. 19a-21 (Ex. 35, p. 2). ThoseMSHA rules require factors of safety that range from four to seven, dependingon the type of use and the length of wire rope. OSHA notes that these factorsof safety are considerably less than the range of factors (7.60 to 10.70)those currently required for personnel hoists in 29 CFR 1926.552(c)(14)(iii).In addition, the MSHA rules contain more stringent maintenance, inspectionand rope-replacement criteria than OSHA. Absent these additional safeguards,OSHA does not believe that adopting the MSHA design factors of four to7 percent would be sufficiently protective. However, a single design factorof 10 may not be appropriate for all hoists used in underground construction,and, as the current standards recognize, the design factor may vary dependingon the speed of the hoist. In this regard, it should be noted that theANSI A10.16 standard continues to refer to the ANSI A10.4 standard forpersonnel hoists, which in turn contains the same requirements for wirerope design factors as the current OSHA standard. Therefore, OSHA believesthat employee safety is best protected by referring to the design factorsfound in 29 CFR 1926.552(c)(14)(iii) for wire rope on personnel hoists.OSHA has revised the formula for computation of the design factor thatwas proposed at paragraph (t)(1)(iii)(c). Final Rule (t)(3)(xviii) containsthe method for determining the design factor for wire rope used in undergroundconstruction hoists. Other than minor editorial changes, OSHA has deletedthe requirement for acceleration and deceleration allowances due to thedifficulty that MSHA stated field personnel would have when attemptingto determine such factors (Ex. 35, p. 3).OSHA solicited comments on load testing for hoists used in undergroundconstruction (see 48 FR 35806). OSHA proposed, in paragraph (t)(4)(i)(G)(<T3>1</T3>), to increase the frequency of load-testing from annually toquarterly. Mr. Bruce Harvey, with J. S. Redpath, pointed out that suchan increase in frequency could result in excessive damage to permanenthoist installations (Ex. 17-8). Al Johnson Construction Company contendedthat the proposed recordkeeping and stringent checking of hoists seemedexcessive (Ex. 17-19). None of the commenters supported the increased frequency,so OSHA has decided to retain an annual frequency for load testing. OSHAhas also decided to revise the proposed requirement that a copy of thetest records be maintained for the duration of the project (proposed paragraph(t)(4)(i)(G)<T3>(2)</T3>. Final Rule paragraph (t)(3)(xxi) requires that the personperforming such inspections and tests certify when the required tests andinspections were performed, identify the hoist, and sign the certification.Only the most recent certification is required to be kept until completionof the project. This certification requirement is consistent with recentOSHA rulemaking practices (see 51 FR 34552 and 52 FR 12120).OSHA proposed, in paragraph (t)(1)(ii)(I), a requirement for a trial runof all cranes and hoists after repairs or after being out of service forone shift. OSHA has limited the scope of that proposed standard to applyonly to hoists in this Final Rule. The requirements for cranes are thoseexisting standards in andSection; 1926.550.OSHA proposed, in paragraph (t)(2), additional requirements for personnelhoisting by both cranes and hoists. Such hoisting operations would primarilybe for the purpose of routine access to the underground via a shaft.Kenny Construction Company commented that OSHA should apply proposed andSection;1926.550(g), ``Crane or Derrick Suspended Personnel Platforms'' (49 FR6280), in place of the proposed rules in paragraph (t) of this rulemaking,which are related to crane hoisting of personnel (Ex. 31). OSHA has carefullyconsidered this and the many other comments received on the proposed rulesof Underground Construction related to the use of cranes to hoist personnel.OSHA believes the provisions of andSection; 1926.550(g) appropriately addressthe hazards of personnel hosisting by cranes in underground constructionas well as in other construction work. It provides a comprehensive approachto the hazards of hoisting personnel. Section andSection; 1926.550(g) limitsthe use of cranes to hoist personnel to situations where it is the safestor only method available; however, OSHA believes these limitations areneither appropriate nor necessary for routine access to underground constructionoperations (where a crane-suspended platform is being used for transportationbetween levels and not as a work platform) for several reasons. First,the cranes used to hoist personnel for routine access do not need to travelduring hoisting. Second, the hoisting takes place in a shaft where windeffects are minimal. And third, the boom angle and length do not need tobe adjusted during hoisting. (For more background on paragraph (g) of andSection;1926.550, the entire record related to that rulemaking is contained inOSHA Docket number S-409.)Since OSHA has removed personnel hoisting by cranes from the scope of thisFinal Rule, paragraph (t)(4) now only pertains to hoisting personnel byhoists.Paragraph (t)(4)(i) requires two means of stopping and holding the load.Mr. Bruce Harvey, with J.S. Redpath, stated that OSHA had created confusionin its proposal by referring to one brake in proposed paragraph (t)(2)(ii),and then referring to two brakes in the accompanying explanation (48 FR35804). OSHA is not requiring two brakes. Only one of the two requiredmeans of stopping the load must be a brake and is required by paragraph(t)(3)(i) of this Final Rule. The other means of stopping could be, forexample, a second brake, a torque converter control, or the controls ofhydraulic hoist drum system. Based on MSHA testimony (Ex. 35, p. 6), thestatement in the proposal that broken-rope safeties are not acceptableas a means of stopping and holding the load has been expanded to includesafety catches and arrestment devices.Final Rule paragraph (t)(4)(vi) requires broken-rope safety devices, safetycatches or arrestment devices for personnel platforms operating on guiderails or guide ropes. This rule is derived from proposed rule (t)(1)(iv)(D).Cranes have been removed from the scope of this paragraph because andSection;1926.550(g) applies to crane operations. The terms ``safety catches'' and``arrestment devices'' were added as a result of MSHA's recommendation(Ex. 35, p. 6). For a further explanation of this paragraph, see the discussionpertaining to paragraphs (t)(3) (xv)-(xvii) earlier in this preamble.Proposed rule paragraph (t)(4)(ii)(D)(<T3>1</T3>) required overspeed governors to activate at 100 feet per minuteover the rated speed. MSHA recommended revising the limit to 15 percentabove the rated speed (Ex. 35, p. 7). This recommendation is consistentwith language in ANSI A10.4, Safety Requirements for Personnel Hoists,which is already referenced by andSection; 1926.552(c)(16). Therefore, OSHAdecided not to address this issue separately in the Final Rule and to continueto rely on that general personnel hoist standard for overspeed protection.Proposed rule paragraph (t)(4)(ii)(D)(<T3>2</T3>) required devices to limit acceleration and deceleration tosix feet per second per second. Mr. Capra, with Systems Control, arguedthat hoists with an AC-wound motor hoist cannot meet this specification(Ex. 47). Mr. Lange, with Fenix and Scisson, Inc., questioned if OSHA meantsomething other than the normal overspeed and over and under-winds on aLilly controller (Ex. 17-20). OSHA's current standard on personnel hoistsdoes not specifically address acceleration/deceleration rates, but controlsthem indirectly by the andSection; 1926.552 reference to ANSI A10.4, whichsets forth provisions pertaining to controls, brakes, and normal and finalstopping devices; those current rules apply to all personnel hoists. Inresponse to the comments received, OSHA has not carried forward the proposedspecification for acceleration and decelaration rates, but will the continueto rely on the current requirements in these areas.Paragraph (u) DefinitionsOSHA has moved the definition of ``acceptable'' from a note in the proposaland placed it in this paragraph. OSHA has also added a definition of ``rapidexcavation machines'' in order to include machines such as roadheadersand shields which some persons might not consider to be a tunnel boringmachine (see discussion of paragraphs (j)(1)(iv) and (j)(2)(ii) above).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Regulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysisof the Underground Construction Standard </ITAG>Introduction Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197, February 19, 1981) requires that aregulatory analysis be conducted for any rule having major economic consequenceson the national economy, individual industries, geographical regions, orlevels of government. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980,5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires OSHA to determine whether a regulation willhave a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Consistent with these requirements, OSHA has prepared a Regulatory Impactand Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RIA) for the Underground Constructionstandard. This analysis includes a profile of the industries that are coveredby the standard, an estimate of the number of exposed workers, a reviewof the nonregulatory alternatives, and assessments of the technologicalfeasibility, costs, benefits, and overall economic impacts of the finalstandard. The RIA is available at the OSHA Docket Office. The Need for Regulation OSHA has assessed the need for this regulation and has determined thatthe risks incurred by employees in underground construction warrant a revisedstandard. Based upon data obtained on site visits to both large and smalltunneling projects in 1979 and 1982, JRB Associates, Inc., under contractto OSHA (Ex. 11), found that approximately 10,000 employees (of which about3,100 are employees of small firms) work underground. Due to the cyclicalnature of this work, employment had declined to 8,136 employees workingbelow ground by 1987. Using data from JRB site visits and OSHA Fatality/Catastrophe(FAT/CAT) Reports, OSHA estimates that 6 to 7 fatalities occur among employeesdoing underground construction work each year. In addition, 2 fatalitieseach year are caused by worker exposures to gassy atmospheres while workingunderground. By comparison, 1985 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS) indicate that for the same number of full-time workers, there wereabout 3.1 occupational fatalities in mining and construction, and 0.5 fatalitiesin manufacturing industries. OSHA estimates that underground constructionworkers experienced about 1,109 lost-time injuries in 1986, or an averageof 13.6 lost-time accidents for every 100 full-time workers. In contrast,BLS reports that the 1985 lost-time accident rate was 6.8 for construction4.8 for mining, and 4.6 for manufacturing. These data confirm that significant workplace hazards continue to existin underground construction work. OSHA's review of these accidents indicatesthat underground construction fatalities and injuries can be reduced byeliminating such major underground hazards as unsafe means of access andegress, accumulation of toxic or explosive gases, conditions susceptibleto ground collapse, and unsafe hoisting operations. In addition to the specific workplace hazards, OSHA believes that the highaccident rate in this industry results from uninformed workers who unknowinglyimplement unsafe or improper work procedures. Currently, many employeeshave only a limited understanding of the hazards of underground construction,because this industry has a high labor turnover and therefore a high percentageof new employees. New employees are at serious risk until they obtain accurateinformation on job-related hazards and safe work procedures. In addition,many workers in this industry do not perform the same task every day, nordo they remain in one place for long periods of time. Consequently, theseworkers are not as familiar with the associated risks of their assignmentsas are workers in other industries who perform fairly repetitive tasks.Finally, employees of different trades (e.g., laborers, welders, and electricians)who frequently work together on a project may be unaware of how their ownsafety is affected by the work of others. In addition, these employeeshave no reasonable means of determining whether their co-workers are takingthe proper precautions to avoid workplace disasters. Thus, OSHA believesthat underground construction work remains hazardous at least partly dueto changing work surroundings and to new employees who lack sufficientknowledge of the hazards of tunnel and shaft construction. Potential Benefits From Regulation OSHA estimated the potential benefits of the final standard on the basisof JRB's economic impact analysis and on accident data (i.e., lost-timeinjuries and fatalities) obtained from the following sources: The 1977report developed by Safety Sciences, Inc. for OSHA entitled, ``TechnicalAssistance in the Development and Evaluation of an OSHA Regulation Strategyfor Underground Construction''; the Maryland First Reports of Injury (FRI);the regional files included in OSHA's Management Information System (MIS)data base, the OSHA State Plan data base, and OSHA Fatality/Catastrophereports. The annual number of underground construction fatalities that would beprevented due to compliance with the revised standard was estimated onthe basis of four of the available data bases (which contain informationon fatalities for a number of years). Based on these sources, it was determinedthat 53 percent of the fatalities each year could be prevented by compliancewith the revised standard. OSHA estimates that about 5 fatalities (i.e.,53 percent of the 8 to 9 fatalities that occur each year) would be preventedannually due to compliance with the final standard. This benefits estimate includes two fatalities each year from worker exposuresto gassy atmospheres. With regard to circumstnaces in which gas is present,there have been at least four major tunnel disasters involving the explosionof petroleum vapors since 1971. In Sulmar, California 17 men were killedin 1971; in Port Huron, Michigan 21 men were killed in 1971; in Green Bay,Wisconsin 4 men were killed in 1974; and in November of 1988 a methanegas explosion in a sewer tunnel under construction in Milwaukee, Wisconsinkilled 3 men who had re-entered the tunnel (after it had been evacuateddue to the detection of high levels of methane) to check on its safety.OSHA has studied these disasters and determined that they were primarilycaused by inadequate ventilation and lack of monitoring. Although suchdisasters do not occur on a regular basis, OSHA beleives these hazardscontinue to exist. Because this rule addresses these hazards, OSHA hasestimated the potential benefits from the requirements which cover thesesituations. The annual number of underground construction lost-time injuries that wouldbe prevented due to compliance with the revised standard was estimatedon the basis of the Safety Sciences and Maryland FRI data. These two sourcescontain injury information collected over several years. Based on thesetwo sources, OSHA estimates that 145 out of 780 injuries in the SafetySciences data base would have been prevented due to compliance with therevised standard. Thus, OSHA estimates that a total of about 229 injuriesout of the 1,378 injuries in both data bases (i.e., 16.6 percent) couldhave been prevented due to compliance with the revised standard. OSHA,therefore, estimates that compliance with the revised standard will preventabout 185 injuries per year (i.e., 16.6 percent of the estimated 1,109injuries that occur each year). In sum, as a result of compliance with the final standard, OHSA estimatesthat the annual lost-time injuries can be reduced by at least 16.6 percent,from 1,109 injuries to 924 injuries, and that annual fatalities can bereduced by at least 53 percent from 8 to 9 to about 3 deaths per year.Technological Feasibility Determination In evaluating the technological feasibility of the standard, OSHA carefullyexamined the economic data and proposed requirements. In their analysis,JRB considered the factors associated with equipment-related and nonequipment-relatedprovisions. In terms of equipment-related provisions, JRB considered theequipment required, the availability of equipment, and the current industrypractice. They also examined the differences in compliance methods or theuse of equipment for small businesses, the technological advances thathave recently or may soon affect methods of compliance, and the use ofrequired equipment by other industries where relevant. JRB also evaluatednonequipment-related provisions resulting in possible procedural or workpractice changes. As a result of that analysis, JRB found that many of the provisions ofthe 1983 proposal are similar to those of the American National StandardsInstitute (ANSI), and to the Michigan and California standards. For example,the ANSI standard (andSection; 4.1) requires accident prevention programs,but does not specifically mention evaluation procedures for these programs.Similarly, both the Michigan and the California standards specificallyaddress emergency and evacuation plans (Rule 408.41463 and section 8426,respectively). Since the publication of the 1983 proposal, however, OSHA has receivedmuch additional information and has concluded that some of the provisions,as drafted in the 1983 proposal, may not have been cost-effective or feasible.Examples of those provisions include requirements for the use of guidesand safeties on cranes and falling object protective structures (FOPS)in all tunnels. Based on the record, OSHA made various modifications tothose parts of the standard that would have been most difficult to implement.OSHA believes that all of the provisions, as currently drafted, are feasible.Estimated Costs of Compliance For the 1983 proposal, OSHA's estimate of the compliance costs associatedwith the revisions to 29 CFR 1926.800 was based primarily upon data containedin the JRB report. JRB developed and analyzed provisions proposed in theSeptember 1982 OSHA draft of the standard and calculated the total estimatedcost for industry end-use sectors, such as mass transit and sewer tunnels,as well as for the entire underground construction industry. Since the publication of the 1983 proposal, the Agency has received usefulcomments concerning these compliance cost estimates. In cases where theAgency determined that the provisions as drafted in the 1983 proposal wereinappropriate (e.g., guides and safeties), the comments served as the basisfor revisions or deletions. Additionally, in cases where the Agency determinedthat the provisions were necessary, the comments served as the basis forrevisions in OSHA's compliance cost estimates. From a baseline of current industry practice, OSHA estimates, as summarizedin table III-1, that full compliance with the provisions of the final standardwill cost the underground construction industry a total of about $2.9 millionannually_including approximately $883 thousand for large sites and $2.02million for small sites. Most of these costs are related to new provisionsin the standard. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s100,11,11,11 </C><T4>Table III-</T4>1._<T4>Summary of Compliance Cost Estimates for All Underground ConstructionSites </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[1987 Dollars] </ITAG><H1>Type of cost </H1><H1>Estimated Cost of the Final Standard * </H1><H2>Large sites </H2><H2>Small sites </H2><H2>Total</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Non-gassy <D>648,713 </D><D>1,468,025 </D><D>2,116,738 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Potentially gassy <D>230,327 </D><D>554,104 </D><D>784,431 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gassy <D>4,759 </D><D>1,016 </D><D>5,775 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Totals <D>883,799 </D><D>2,023,145 </D><D>2,906,945 </D><F>Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis,1988. </F><F>* OSHA's estimate is based on a non-supervisory wage rate of $17.39per hour and a ten year useful equipment life.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Cost Estimates for Requirements Unrelated to Flammable Gas</ITAG>Given the current level of compliance in underground construction, OSHAestimates that the total annual compliance costs for those provisions unrelatedto the presence of flammable gas will be about $648,713 for large sitesand about $1,468,025 for small sites. Similarly, based on an assumptionof full compliance with existing standards, the incremental cost of thoserequirements unrelated to the presence of flammable gas would be $627,471and $1,428,717 for large and small sites respectively.The major costs of these requirements are related to lost work time. Forexample, with regard to large sites the two most expensive provisions_whichpertain to equipment used for hauling_account for about 47 percent of theestimated costs. The associated labor costs are for workers to connectand disconnect cars in order to ensure that occupied mancars are pulled(where switching facilities are available) and to ensure that the locomotiveis always downhill of the car on steep grades (if safety chains are notused). Similarly, for small sites, the provision requiring that a designatedperson remain above ground whenever anyone is working underground accountsfor almost half of the total estimated compliance costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Provisions Pertaining to Flammable Gas</ITAG>OSHA received considerable comment on the cost estimates associated withprovisions of the proposal that pertained to gassy operations in tunnels.The proposal set forth a number of circumstances under which tunnels mustbe classified and operated as ``gassy,'' including a one-time reading ofthe lower explosive limit (LEL) for methane, or a 10-percent or more readingof the LEL for other flammable gasses. The proposal specified a numberof requirements (i.e., Schedule 31 equipment, signs, permissible ventilation,monitoring, etc.) for tunnels classified as gassy.In estimating the compliance costs associated with the proposal, OSHA tookinto account the cost of the additional requirements of the proposal ascompared to the current standard, but did not estimate the higher percentageof tunnels being classified as ``gassy.'' This resulted in an underestimationof the total compliance costs associated with these provisions of the proposal.In reviewing the comments concerning changes in the requirements relatedto flammable gas, OSHA found that the most common recommendation was forOSHA to give the tunneling contractor some method of avoiding classifyingthe operation as gassy if alternative methods existed to control the gasproblem. Based on these and other comments, OSHA developed a classificationscheme for the final underground construction standard that specifies agradual phase-in of requirements according to the concentration of gasencountered in tunnels, and permits tunnels to be declassified from ``gassy''under appropriate conditions.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cost Estimates for Operations Classified as Potentially Gassy</ITAG>In addition to a permissible ventilation system, the standard requiresthe following three types of flammable gas monitoring for operations thatwould be classified as potentially gassy:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) Continuous automatic monitoring when rapid excavation machinesare being used </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) Manual monitoring twice per shift</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) Monitoring before hot work.</ITAG>JRB analyzed a geographic distribution of planned tunnel construction inorder to determine which prospective sites might be classified as potentiallygassy. As a result of their analysis, JRB estimated that 17 percent ofthe projected tunnel operations for the years 1985 through 2000 will beclassified as potentially gassy.Based upon the assumption that sites visited by JRB (i.e., sites 5, 9 andB) are representative of the entire underground construction industry,OSHA first estimated the costs of bringing those three sites into complianceand then extrapolated the compliance costs to the entire industry. OSHAestimates that the annual cost to comply with the potentially gassy requirementswill be about $230,327 for the large sites, and $554,104 for the smallsites.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cost Estimates for Operations Classified as Gassy</ITAG>The standard requires that any operation exceeding the 10-percent LEL for3 consecutive days shall be classified as gassy and shall meet the followingrequirements when employees are working in the tunnel:<ITAG tagnum="15">(i)(1) Use only acceptable equipment, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(i)(2) Use either Schedule 31 mobile diesel-powered equipment or fullyequivalent equipment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(i)(3) Post signs,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(i)(4) Prohibit smoking,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(i)(5) Post fire watch, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(k)(12) Provide above ground controls for reversing the air flow.</ITAG>JRB estimated that 1 percent of all underground construction operationsduring the years 1985-2000 will exceed the 10-percent LEL trigger for 3consecutive days. In addition, it was estimated that for half of theseoperations (0.5 percent of all tunnels), the gassy classification willonly be temporary because the standard permits constructors to take stepsto reduce gas concentrations without first having to meet the gassy operationrequirements. Thus, it is estimated that only 0.5 percent of tunnels willbe classified as ``gassy.'' Based on this assumption, OSHA estimates thatthe large sites would incur about $4,759 in added costs, and the smallsites about $1,016 in additional compliance costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Summary of Costs of Provisions Pertaining to Flammable Gas</ITAG>Thus, OSHA estimates that the underground construction industry will incurless than $1 million in additional costs to comply with the provisionsrelated to flammable gas. Large sites will incur about $235,086 in additionalannual compliance costs, and small sites will incur about $555,120 in additionalannual compliance costs. For both large and small sites, the additionallabor associated with atmospheric testing (i.e., provisions (j)(2) (i),(iii), (iv)) is the major cost component. These provisions account forabout 98 percent of the estimated $230,327 in annual costs for large sitesto comply with the provisions related to potentially gassy operations,and 96.6 percent of all of the costs associated with the provisions relatedto flammable gas. For small sites, these provisions account for about 86.0percent of the annual compliance costs associated with provisions relatedto potentially gassy operations, and 85.8 percent of the annual compliancecosts associated with all of the provisions related to flammable gas. Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisIn accordance with Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980, OSHA assessed the potential economic impact of the final standardon the underground construction industry as a whole and on small entitiesin particular. Based largely on the JRB Economic Impact Analysis, OSHAestimates that even under its upper bound scenario (which assumes a fiveyear equipment depreciation factor), large and small firms in the undergroundconstruction industry will remain viable. The Agency estimates that the costs of complying with the final rule willbe a minimal percentage of total annual revenue, amounting to less than.067 percent for large firms and .76 percent for small firms. OSHA believesthat these costs will produce minor effects of less than 1 percent uponmost of the important measures of the industry's economic status, suchas profit, output, and employment. Thus, OSHA concludes that no large firmswill fail as a result of increased compliance costs and that only 1 smallfirm out of the total 262 small firms might fail due to increased compliancecosts. Even under OSHA's upper bound the costs of compliance will still not exceed.069 percent of revenue for large firms and .87 percent of revenue forsmall firms. Thus, the final standard will not significantly affect theunderground construction industry. Even if small firms incur annual compliancecosts of $2.29 million (i.e., OSHA's upper bound cost estimate) and cannotpass any of the added compliance costs on to their customers, OSHA anticipatesno change in the stability or competitiveness of the small firms in thisindustry. Moreover, OSHA believes that the actual impacts will be lessthan those estimated by this analysis because small or marginal firms canchoose to avoid some of these costs by not working on the more difficultpotentially gassy or gassy projects. Thus, OSHA concludes that the compliance costs of the final undergroundconstruction standard will not affect the viability of small firms andthe potential economic impact on these entities will be minimal. Cost Effectiveness of RuleBefore promulgating a safety standard, Executive Order 12291 of February17, 1981, requires the Agency to evaluate the economic effects of the regulatoryaction. As a means of attaining some perspective on the cost-effectivenessof the standard, OSHA calculated the net benefits of the final rule. Inparticular, a 1981 study by Levitt and coworkers (Levitt, Raymond, et al.,``Improving Construction Safety Performance: The User's Role'', StanfordUniversity, Department of Civil Engineering Technical Report andplusmin;260,August 1981) was used to determine the cost effectiveness of the finalrule. Based on the results of this study_that a firm saves about $5,122(in 1987 dollars) from improved productivity and reduced recordkeepingper lost-workday injury or fatality-prevented-total industry savings amountto about $973,180 per year as a result of compliance with the provisionsof the final standard, (i.e., $5,122andmultiply;185 lost-workday injuriesprevented +$5,122andmultiply;5.0 fatalities prevented). With total compliancecost estimated at $2,906,945, this results in a total effective compliancecosts of $1,933,765 per year or a cost of $386,573 per life saved. Similarly,from a baseline of current compliance with the existing standard, the incrementalcost per life saved amounts to $758,148. However, these costs are overstatedsince no allowance has been made for the expected reduction in non-fatalinjuries, and the consequent increase in aggregate worker utility thatattends such a reduction. Studies which utilize a willingness-to-pay approachto identify the cost of injuries, have estimated costs (and converselythe cost saving of an injury avoided) to be over $32,000 dallars per non-fatalinjury avoided. Environmental EffectsThis rule and its major alternatives have been reviewed in accordance withthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.),the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Part 1500),and OSHA's DOL NEPA Procedures (29 CFR Part 11). As a result of this reviewthe rule is not anticipated to have a significant effect on air or waterquality, solid waste disposal, or land use. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. OMB Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This subpart contains a collection of information in andSection; 1926.800(j)(3).This provision requires employers to maintain a record of their air-qualitytests at the job site.

State Plan Requirements</ITAG>The 25 states and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupationalsafety and health plans must revise their existing standard within sixmonths or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g., because an existingstate standard covering this area is already ``at least as effective''as the revised Federal standard. These states and territories are: Alaska,Arizona, California, Connecticut*<NOTE/>, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,Nevada, New Mexico, New York*, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, SouthCarolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington,Wyoming.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>*Plan covers only state and local government employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Federalism</ITAG>The final standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. This Orderrequires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting statepolicy options, consult with states prior to taking any actions that wouldrestrict state policy options, and take such actions only when there isclear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of nationalscope. The Order provides for preemption of state law only if there isa clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemptionis to be limited to the extent possible.Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expressesCongress' clear intent to preempt state laws relating to issues with respectto which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.Under the OSH Act, a state can avoid preemption only if it submits, andobtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standardsand their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developedby such Plan-States must, among other things, be as least as effectivein providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment asthe Federal standards.This Federal standard for underground construction is drafted so that allconstruction workers will be protected by general, performance-orientedstandards. To the extent that there are state or regional peculiaritiesthat could alter construction methods, states with occupational safetyand health plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act would be ableto develop their own state standards to deal with any special problems.Moreover, the performance nature of this proposed standard, of and by itself,allows for flexibility by states and contractors to provide as much safetyas possible using varying methods consonant with conditions in each state.In short, there is a clear national problem related to the occupationalsafety and health of construction workers. While the individual states,if all acted, might be able collectively to deal with the safety problemsinvolved, most have not elected to do so in the 17 years since the enactmentof the OSH Act. Those states which have elected to participate under section18 of the OSH Act would not be preempted by this proposed regulation, andwould be able to address special, local conditions within the frameworkprovided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that theirstandards are at least as effective as the Federal standard.
