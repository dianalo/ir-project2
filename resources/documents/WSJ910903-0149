The charge, plus another $25 million provision forrestructuring, will result in a loss for the quarter.Analysts estimate it will be roughly $140 million, wiping outearnings of $62 million for the first half. In addition,Continental said it would cut its quarterly dividend to 15cents from 25 cents, reduce its work force another 5% andwithdraw as a primary dealer in government securities.</LP><TEXT>   Continental's stock -- which already had been hammeredlast week by sales from the Tisch family and rumors thatexaminers from the Comptroller of the Currency were taking atough stance on Continental's loan-loss provisions -- fellagain Friday on the announcement. It was quoted at $12.375,down 87.5 cents, in late New York Stock Exchange trading.   Continental Chief Financial Officer Hollis Rademachermaintained that the special charge was &quot;purely voluntary andnot in reaction to anything threatened or written&quot; fromexaminers. He said in an interview, &quot;The economy has notrebounded strongly and we should be prepared in casecommercial real estate deteriorates further.&quot; He declined tocomment on exactly how wide the third-quarter loss will be.   The $150 million special charge for possible loan losseswill be in addition to the provision of $50 million or morethat had been expected by analysts as a repeat of the secondquarter.   Continental, based in Chicago, does not have an especiallyhigh exposure to commercial real estate, but the catalyst forthe big special charge is apparently the loss potentialwithin $500 million in loans to California home real estatedevelopers.   Mr. Rademacher confirmed that Comptroller of the Currencyexaminers &quot;are currently here and that California real estateis of concern to them.&quot; He added that recent actions byexaminers elsewhere in downgrading the status of loanssyndicated in the banking industry &quot;suggests that prudentmanagements prepare for heavy weather.&quot;   Judah Kraushaar, banking analyst for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.,said Continental had indicated to him that California realestate was largely responsible for the extra provision. &quot;Itfosters the impression that regulators are continuing toclamp down on isolated parts of the country,&quot; he said.Security Pacific Corp., which is based in Los Angeles,recently added a large loan-loss provision as well.   Loans to heavily indebted corporations, so-called HLTloans, &quot;have crested&quot; and were not a factor in the specialcharge, Mr. Rademacher said. Continental's overall provisionfor bad loans, including Latin debt, had been below theindustry average.   Getting closer to the industry norm was apparently also amotivating factor, said Kenneth Puglisi, a senior vicepresident of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc. &quot;It looks likethey're trying to get their balance sheet in better shape for1992,&quot; he said. &quot;They're not alone. A lot of banks have beenincreasing loan-loss reserves of late.&quot;   Mr. Rademacher added, &quot;We have no desire to stick out likea sore thumb.&quot;   The expected loss for the third quarter, however, willlower the banking company's key equity/capital ratio tobetween 5.3% and 5.5%, it said in the announcement. Whilethat remains well above the 4% minimum regulatory guidelinethat must be met by the end of 1992, it is a drop from 6.1%at the end of the second quarter.   The lower capital ratio, said Rick Bosley, an analyst forChicago Corp., could be one of the factors that may leadrating concerns to drop some of Continental's debt below aninvestment-grade rating, a move that could hurt bondholders.Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said Friday it was placing thebanking company's debt, including its commercial paper, on&quot;CreditWatch&quot; for possible downgrading pending a review withmanagement.   Continental is the latest in a long list of large banks tocut its dividend since real estate loan problems weighedheavier last year. It also joins a number of other banks thathave given up their primary government securities dealershipstatus with the Federal Reserve. Tighter competition hascaused thinner and thinner profit margins, and while severalyears ago such status &quot;may have given more access to interestrate knowledge, in today's world it doesn't matter,&quot; said Mr.Rademacher. &quot;There's no economic value in it.&quot;   Some of the $25 million in the charge for restructuring isto cover the cost of closing down the 40-person dealershipunit. The charge also reflects retrenchment overseas,including the closing of a 20-person operation in Singaporeand scaling back of personnel in Europe. Altogether,Continental is in the process of laying off 250 of its5,000-person work force, which is down 45% from four yearsago.   Stock analysts expect a return of earnings in the fourthquarter, but not enough to keep Continental from reporting afullyear loss because of the special charge. Next year, Mr.Puglisi sees the company earning $2.80 a share on its 53.8million shares outstanding, in contrast to an expected lossof $1.60 a share this year.   Mr. Kraushaar expects earnings of about $1 a share nextyear, which he says is a conservative estimate. He isrecommending the stock long-term because it is priced atabout half its book value, but is &quot;cautious&quot; about expectinggains in coming months.   Mr. Bosley, who changed his recommendation to hold frombuy on the news, said the lower the price of the stock falls,the more attractive Continental becomes as an acquisitioncandidate to other non-retail oriented banks. Continental,which underwent a government bailout in 1984, specializes incorporate lending, corporate finance and risk-managementservices for corporate clients, especially medium-sizedcompanies in the Midwest. During the second quarter, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. sold its 26% stake in thecompany to the public at $12.75 a share.</TEXT></DOC>
