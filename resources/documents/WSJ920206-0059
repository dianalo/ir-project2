Peter Nevola, the former chief executive of the RhodeIsland Share andamp; Deposit Indemnity Corp., and Joseph Bellucci,Risdic's former president, were charged with conspiring tocommit bank fraud and filing false documents to the state andRisdic board. They were also charged with concealing andfailing to report the existence of an alleged $13 millionembezzlement by former Heritage Loan andamp; Investment Co.President Joseph Mollicone Jr.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mollicone disappeared in November 1990, triggering arun on Heritage. To cover withdrawals, Risdic, which insuredcredit unions and small banks in the state, had to pump morethan $14.5 million into Heritage. That drained the insurer'sfunds, which contributed to a run on other banks andeventually prompted state officials to close 45 banks andcredit unions insured by Risdic.   Some of the institutions, which had large bad-loanportfolios, remain closed because they were unable to qualifyfor federal deposit insurance.   If convicted, Mr. Nevola, 51 years old, and Mr. Bellucci,62, face a maximum sentence of 42 years in jail and fines of$26,000 each. Attorneys for Mr. Bellucci and Mr. Nevoladeclined to comment.   A spokesman for Attorney General James E. O'Neil said Mr.Bellucci was arrested at his home in Palm City, Fla. Mr.Nevola will surrender for arraignment at a later date, thespokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
