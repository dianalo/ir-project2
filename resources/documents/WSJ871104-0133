The company said that, as of Sept. 30, it had cut 32,800 salaried employees from its payroll. GM has said it plans to cut 25,000 salaried workers by the end of this year and another 15,000 by the end of 1988, all from its automotive business. A spokeswoman added that it is &quot;possible&quot; that GM may hit its 40,000 target by the end of this year.    As of Sept. 30, the auto maker had 147,200 salaried workers world-wide. GM, saddled with a high cost structure, said in a letter to shareholders last February that the cuts will save the company $500 million this year and $2 billion annually by 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
