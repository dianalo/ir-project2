Col. Jean-Claude Paul, along with his brother and ex-wife, werecharged in a federal indictment unsealed Thursday with using alanding strip on the colonel's farm to fly a 100-kilogram, or220-pound, cocaine shipment to the Bahamas for delivery to Miami.   Haitian President Leslie Manigat has turned Paul's case over tohis country's military courts for investigation. There is noextradition treaty between Haiti and the United States.   One of the principal witnesses in the case, Osvaldo Quintana,told reporters in January that he saw 9,000 kilograms, or 19,800pounds, of cocaine in duffel bags in the Haitian presidentialpalace during the administration of ousted leader Jean-ClaudeDuvalier.   Quintana also told The Associated Press that other Haitianofficials besides Paul had a role in the smuggling, but he wouldnot disclose their names.   The alleged trafficking by high-level Haitians has angered Sen.Bob Graham, D-Fla., who said he will introduce legislation thisweek to lift U.S. trade preferences with Haiti.   ``This indictment is further indication that we can't tolerate aregime in Haiti that seized power from the Haitian people so itcould continue the oppression of the past,'' said Graham.   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Jack Hook said bettertechnology such as improved radar and more cooperation fromBahamian authorities have sharply limited the traditional drugroutes into South Florida.   That has forced Colombian cocaine traffickers to go throughother Caribbean islands.   ``We have seen an increase in Haiti being used as atransshipment point since we stepped up enforcement,'' said Hook.   Asked about Quintana's allegations that other Haitian officialsare involved, Hook would say only that the investigation iscontinuing.   ``The message that this case sends is the corrupting effects onpublic officials everywhere becuse of drug trafficking,'' said Hook.   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., was blunter about the Haitianconnection.   ``More than two years ago I questioned the DEA about increaseddrug trafficking through Haiti, and about government involvement inthe traffic,'' Smith said recently.   He said the DEA told him then they had no information on Haitianofficials' involvement in drug smuggling.   ``This is the kind of head-in-the-sand attitude that has allowedgovernment after government to fall prey to the Colombiancartels,'' said Smith.   Whether it is a few corrupt officials, a policy of the newmilitary-supported government, or just coincidence, Haiti's rolehas changed since Duvalier fled.   ``There has been some increase in drug interceptions since theHaitian government changed two years ago,'' acknowledged CoastGuard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson.   He said drug officials are spotting more planes flying over theHaitian half of the island of Hispaniola, which Haiti shares withthe Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic recently shot down asuspected trafficker, but Simpson said Haiti does not have theresources to chase drug planes.   Hook said that since November the DEA has had an office inPort-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, and is optimistic that Haitianofficials will cooperate.   In the 90 days before the DEA's arrival, Haitian customsofficials seized 1,500 pounds of cocaine hidden on planes atPort-au-Prince's airport, he said.   And the Paul case should make it even more difficult fortraffickers, he said.   ``The publicity is going to put a little heat on Haiti,'' saidHook.   But he said no one should expect trafficking to cease if Haiticlamps down, since smugglers are already using Cuba, the Turks andCaicos Islands and other routes.   ``There is no Caribbean island close to the United States thathas gone unscathed,'' said Hook. ``It just shows the magnitude ofthe problem.''</TEXT></DOC>
