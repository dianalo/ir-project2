Lately, bees in Scottsdale, Ariz., have been finding timefor swimming -- in some of the region's finest residentialpools.</LP><TEXT>   Richard Orlowe, who lives at the pricey Villas atScottsdale Mountain Summit, estimates that he has seen about10,000 bees buzzing around his neighbor's pool, which he usestwice a day. The bees zip in around dawn for a couple ofhours and return for a second dip in late afternoon, whichlocals now call &quot;bee time.&quot;   But bees are bad swimmers. They drown. They sink. Theymake a mess. Mr. Orlowe has found his neighbor's pool skimmersix inches deep with dead bees.   Leo Rickhoff, secretary-treasurer of the Villas residentsassociation, started putting out a water-filled plastickiddie pool as a decoy. The bees didn't take the hint. Hethen forked over $2,500 to several beekeepers to track thebees to their colonies in the nearby McDowell Mountains tokill them. The beekeepers found six colonies and then gaveup. Finally Mr. Rickhoff, whose wife is allergic to beestings, drained his pool. But the bees were waiting whencovers temporarily placed on neighbors' pools as beedeterrants came off.   &quot;The bees, of course, are winning,&quot; says Mr. Rickhoff, ashe languishes in the desert's 115-degree heat.   The problem apparently goes back to this past spring, whenlots of moisture made the desert bloom, and bees got busymaking more bees. Then drought set in, and the thirstyinsects discovered the joys of swimming pools.   Residents have asked Scottsdale city officials, whoalready have a roach hotline, to build pools deep in thedesert for the bees. But Lois Fritz, management assistant forthe mayor, says the bees aren't the city's business. Statebee experts, who believe that battling bees is futile, saythe state has 250,000 wild-bee colonies, with as many as 20colonies per square mile.   Cheryl Gabbard, who lives in Scottsdale's Sonoran Heightsdevelopment, has partly surrendered. At first she followedbeekeepers' suggestions and tried massive doses of chlorinein her pool, then algaecide. She hung lures laced with honeyon trees in the desert. She even hauled four large,water-filled metal tubs into the desert. Finally, shesacrificed her hot tub to the insects, even putting apermeable cloth cover over it so the bees can luxuriatewithout drowning. Now they usually leave the pool for her.Nevertheless, she says, &quot;I'm praying for rain.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
