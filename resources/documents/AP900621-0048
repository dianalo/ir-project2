The House Judiciary Committee bolstered their effort Wednesday,approving 19-17 a bill to subject insurance companies to federalantitrust lawsuits for the first time since 1945.   Three of the committee's 22 Democrats _ Reps. Dan Glickman ofKansas, Bruce Morrison of Connecticut and Edward Feighan of Ohio _voted with all 14 Republicans in opposing it.   The bill would remove the industry's exemption from federalantitrust laws under the 1945 McCarren-Ferguson Act, which turnedthe regulation of insurance companies over to state governments.   Policyholders who could show that states are not activelyregulating the industry could sue insurance companies and theiragents for price-fixing and other anticompetitive practices.   ``Private individuals, local governments and businesses of allsizes have found their premiums skyrocketing and their coverageseverely restricted,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, thecommittee chairman. ``Congress can no longer ignore the widespreadeconomic dislocation caused by unreasonably high premiums orpolicies that are unavailable at any price.''   In addition to price-fixing, damages could be sought for thefollowing anticompetitive practices:   _Allocating territories among competing companies.   _Monopolization.   _Forcing consumers to purchase insurance they don't want so theycan buy the kind they do want. An example is requiring the purchaseof a homeowners' policy in order to get auto insurance.   Consumer groups seeking the legislation for the past 15 yearsacknowledged they face an uphill fight. But they voiced optimismthat the committee vote opens the way for a House floor fight thatwill draw public attention to the issue.   ``This represents an important breakthrough,'' said RobertBrandon, vice president of Citizen Action, a grassroots consumerorganization claiming 2 million members. ``It demonstrates that aninformed and aroused public can break the insurance industry'sstranglehold over legislators.''   Linda Lipsen, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, predictedthe bill will become a major election-year issue once it reachesthe House floor.   ``Behind food and shelter, insurance is the single largestexpenditure of the year for the average consumer,'' she said.``Just like the gun lobby, the insurance lobby is no longer beingperceived by Congress as invincible.''   The bill would allow insurance companies to continue sharing rawdata on claims. But after a five-year transition period, it wouldgreatly weaken companies' reliance upon the Insurance ServicesOffice, a New York-based industry organization that now ``advises''what rates should be charged.   A similar bill was approved by the panel's economic andcommercial law subcommittee two years ago but died there under anintensive industry lobbying effort. Democrats said they hope tobring the new version to the full House in late summer or earlyfall.   Although similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate,industry lobbyists say they are counting on Sens. Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz., and Howell Heflin, D-Ala., both members of the SenateJudiciary Committee, to prevent it from reaching a floor vote there.   ``If this bill is enacted into law, it may prove disastrous forconsumers and small insurance companies alike,'' said Lowell Beck,president of the National Association of Independent Insurers.``Every litigated claim would subject to additional antitrustcounts. Legal costs, which by necessity would be passed on toconsumers, would soar.''   Lipsen disputed that claim, citing a report by the GeneralAccounting Office showing that workers' compensation insurancerates fell by 30 percent in Michigan after its legislature in 1982repealed a state antitrust exemption for such coverage.</TEXT></DOC>
