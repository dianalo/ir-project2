On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, lost 20cents to close the day at $17.53 a barrel. The contract had settled22 cents higher on Thursday after flipflopping earlier in the week.Other contract months also fell.   Heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices were among the refinedproducts that declined on the exchange. The March contract fordomestic heating oil settled 0.24 cent lower at 50.31 cents agallon, while unleaded gasoline closed down 0.45 cent at 49.17 centsa gallon.   Analysts said crude prices had risen on Thursday, spurred by areport in an Arabic-language newspaper that Dubai was considering a10 percent cut in its oil production starting March 1.   A second report on Friday contradicting the earlier statementspushed prices down, said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energyinvestments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   ``It shows the market is still very prone to rumors,'' Barakatsaid.   Barakat said Thursday's report had been perceived as positivebecause it suggested Dubai was willing to cooperate to helpstabilize world oil prices. Dubai has refused to cut its productionsince the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' new quotasystem took effect Jan. 1.   Dubai is one of several emirates in the United Arab Emirates, oneof the 13 OPEC nations. Experts estimate the UAE is exceeding itsquota by about 400,000 barrels a day. It was assigned a quota of988,000 barrels out of a total 18.5 million barrels for the entirecartel.   Investors have remained skittish despite OPEC's new agreementbecause in the past the cartel has had problems sticking to similaraccords. Although prices have risen fairly steadily since Jan. 1,recent reports indicate that several members of the cartel arecontinuing to overproduce.   Analysts said the latest reports from Dubai provided furtherevidence that OPEC's agreement remains shaky.</TEXT></DOC>
