The federal government must resist the temptation to steer thecommercialization process toward specific products, and it must workto further speed the licensing of government patents to industry. Atthe same time, greater efforts are needed to stimulate strong programsin which scientists from government laboratories and academia work sideby side with their colleagues from industry, preferably on a daily basis.There is no clear, step-by-step process that will lead to the successfulmarket introduction of commercial products based on high-temperaturesuperconductors. The key to success is for government to support a widearray of basic research needed to understand the new materials and totransfer that knowledge as quickly as possible to industry. If this canbe done, the US will win the race. If not, American consumers will stillbenefit from products based on high-temperature superconductors. Butmany of these products will be produced overseas, and the profits andjobs they generate will go to other nations.</TEXT></DOC>
