(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor James Usry and eight otherpresent or former public officials were among 14 people chargedtoday with bribery and corruption.   Usry, 67, a former Harlem Globetrotter and city teacher, is inhis second term as mayor. The Republican won the job when formerMayor Michael Matthews was ousted from office in a recall electionafter being implicated in an influence peddling scheme involvingcasino-zoned land.   Christopher Florentz, spokesman for the state attorney general,announced the arrests of 13 of the 14 people this morning. The 14thperson was being sought.   He said the investigation, which started in November, focused onallegations that Atlantic City officials accepted bribes in returnfor granting approval of exemptions from city rent controlordinances and favorable rulings by the zoning board.   They also are accused in the criminal complaint of engaging inconspiracy to gain control over a lucrative boardwalk electric cartbusiness and a gift shop franchise at the Atlantic CityInternational Airport, Florentz said.   Those arrested were taken to a National Guard Armory, whereauthorities would not allow reporters to see them.   Among those arrested were City Council President WalterCollette, 60; zoning board Chairman Kaleem Shabazz; city councilmanArnold Orsatti Jr.; city councilman Gene Dorn, 47; and W. OscarHarris Jr., former director of the Atlantic City Housing Authority,Florentz said.   The mayor was charged with bribery, conspiracy, officialmisconduct and accepting unlawful gifts, Florentz said. Colletteand Dorn were charged with bribery, conspiracy and officialmisconduct; Shabazz and Harris with bribery and conspiracy; Orsattiwith official misconduct and conspiracy.   Usry, Collette and Dorn all were considered likely candidates innext year's non-partisan mayoral contest.   Orsatti's attorney, Thomas Vesper, said as he left the armory,``As far as my client is concerned, it's a mistake.''   A daughter who answered the telephone at Usry's house said thefamily was not taking any calls.   Usry's family moved to Atlantic City from Athens, Ga., when hewas 6 months old. He graduated from Atlantic City High School in1939.   He served in World War II and was a center from 1946 to 1951with the New York Renaissance, an all-black team that became partof the world famous Harlem Globetrotters during his tenure.   He became Atlantic City's assistant superintendent of schools in1977.   Usry's initial mayoral victory in 1984 came with the help of thestate and national Republican organizations. The GOP had saidUsry's election would help them gather minority support in the 1984presidential contest.   Usry was considered an ally of Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean.The governor, vacationing at Fisher Island, N.Y., was informed ofthe arrests, said Bob McHugh, a spokesman.   ``The governor's office has no comment on the matter, and Idon't anticipate one,'' McHugh said.   Matthews was indicted in 1984 for attempting to take $200,000from people linked to an organized crime group in southern NewJersey in exchange for securing land in Atlantic City zoned forcasino operations.   Matthews pleaded guilty in November 1984 to a single count ofextorting $10,000 from an undercover FBI agent and was sentenced amonth later to 15 years in prison and fined $10,000.</TEXT></DOC>
