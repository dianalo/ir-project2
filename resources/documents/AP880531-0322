He did not give figures about the actual amount of oilthought to be in the zone.   The remaining proven reserves of oil in the British continentalshelf amount to 750 million metric tons, while the total remainingreserves could be as high as 4.12 billion metric tons, according tothe Central Office of Information in London.   Brazil's state-run Petrobras oil company and, under a riskcontract, Texaco Oil of the United States, have been exploring theMarajo Island region in Para state, near the mouth of the AmazonRiver.   However, little more than one month ago Brazil announced it hadsuspended its risk contract with Texaco, which nevertheless hascontinued to drill in the region.   In the 1970s, major offshore finds were made off the coast ofRio de Janeiro state, bringing up Brazil's domestic oil productionto 60 percent of consumption.   Current production is around 600,000 barrels a day and Brazilhas cut its oil-import bill by billions of dollars annually.   The newest oil find is 2,277 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.Because of the late hour of the announcement there was no one atPetrobras to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
