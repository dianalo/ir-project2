Now, 40 year later, the world has changed, the West Europeanallies are soothed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's words and actions.They have become less committed to the United States and theyforesee a stronger, independent Western Europe.   ``Some of the glue of the last 40 years is losing its potency,''said John Cross, deputy directaor of the International Institutefor Strategic Studies in London. ``It will need to be replaced by arenewed sense of purpose and vision of the way ahead.''   And so, this is the state of North Atlantic Treaty Organizationas it marks its 40th anniversary April 4.   ``We have to adjust ... to new developments,'' NATOSecretary-General Manfred Woerner said in an interview.   ``That of course is a phase which you could call a crossroad _not changing our basic course but giving it a new vitality, perhapseven new speed and adjusting to new challenges.''   President Bush and other NATO leaders are expected to take afresh look at the alliance's role at a summit May 29-30 at NATO'sheadquarters in Brussels.   ``The alliance is at a point where it's less a problem ofmanaging a crisis but rather a problem of managing change,'' saidOle Bierring, Denmark's ambassador to NATO.   Jane Sharp, senior researcher at the Stockholm InternationalPeace Research Institute in Sweden, said, ``Most of the problemsassociated with NATO are byproducts of its success.''   The key challenge facing the 16 nations of today's NATO stillcomes from the Soviet Union.   President Gorbachev's agenda of glasnost and perestroika and hispromises of reductions in troops and military spending havediminished the perception of that threat _ at least in the public'seyes.   ``It is very, very appealing,'' said Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg ofWest Germany, chairman of NATO's military committee.   ``Since '45, the publics in Europe have lived under theimpression that, `Well, the war's over but it may start again.' Butnow all of a sudden those nations which were considered to be thebig threat are apparently no longer a threat.''   The alliance also faces changes among its members.   Americans, seeing a prosperous Europe, question whetherEuropeans should carry more of the defense burden. Europeans,enjoying wealth and a stronger sense of identity, wonder why theyshould put up with foreign troops and extensive maneuvers on theirsoil.   ``This whole question of burden-sharing is more or less thequestion of which role Europe plays in the future,'' saidSecretary-General Woerner.   Europe's future is being guided in part by ``1992,'' the plan bythe dozen nations of the European Economic Community to eliminatetrade barriers and form a single market by then. All but one _Ireland _ belongs to NATO.   Some defense officials worry the public euphoria over Gorbachevwill lessen support for defense spending and other commitments.   The allies have just entered into new negotiations to try tolessen the East's strength in conventional weapons.   NATO wants the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies in EasternEurope to make much greater cuts to bring the two sides roughly toequal strength.   The starting positions of the two sides, unveiled in Vienna,Austria, in early March, contain surprising similarities, leadingto optimism about an eventual accord.   But the talks have also added fuel to possibly the mostcontroversial issue in NATO _ whether the alliance should modernizeshort-range, or battlefield, nuclear weapons.   At the heart of the debate is a plan, pressed by the UnitedStates and Britain, to upgrade the Lance surface-to-surfacemissile. Military analysts say the Lance, introduced in 1972, willbecome obsolete in 1995.   The missile has a range of a little more than 60 miles. Itsreplacement would have a range of more than 250 miles, just underthe limits of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty,which eliminates U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges ofabout 300 to 3,400 miles.   Gen. John Galvin, the American who is NATO's top militarycommander in Europe, argues that modernizing the Lance will enableNATO to make sharp cuts in nuclear artillery.   The United States wants a firm commitment from the allies beforeit urges Congress to approve money to produce the missile.   But strong resistance in West Germany, where most of the weaponswould be based, has cast doubt.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said recently he wants todelay a decision on the production of the new missile until 1991 or1992 _ after next year's important elections. He also wants anagreement that deployment plans would be scrapped if progress weremade on cutting the East's conventional arms.   Galvin said recently any discussions on reducing short-rangenuclear forces should be delayed until ``after we were satisfiedwith the successes of the (conventional arms) agreement.''   Alton Keel, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, insisted Americansupport for NATO remains strong.   But he cautioned U.S. political backing could be put at risk ifthe perception grew in the United States that Europeans were not ascommitted.   ``It's not now at risk ... but it could be,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, April 3</NOTE></DOC>
