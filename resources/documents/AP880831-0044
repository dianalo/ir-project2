(AP) _ Anti-smoking activists are urging thefederal government to regulate a high-tech, low-smoke cigarettedeveloped by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. that hits three cities fortest-marketing soon.   ``I'm not at all surprised that they announced thetest-marketing,'' said John Banzhaf, executive director of Actionon Smoking and Health, based in Washington, D.C. ``They wanted toget a jump on it. After all, it's a lot more difficult to get thegenie back in the bottle after the fact.''   Reynolds Tobacco announced Tuesday that the new cigarette, whichsimulates smoking by heating a flavor capsule instead of burningtobacco, will be test-marketed in St. Louis, Phoenix and Tucson,Ariz., starting Oct. 1.   Reynolds, one of the nation's largest cigarette manufacturersand a subsidiary of Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco Inc., began sellingthe new brand, Premier, this week to distributors, supermarkets anddiscount chains in the cities.   While it will cost about 25 percent more _ or about 30 cents apack _ than the company's other brands, Reynolds believes it couldbecome its best-selling brand. The company will use a variety ofmessages, including one that touts the cigarette as ``Premier _ theCleaner Smoke.''   Banzhaf said about two dozen anti-smoking groups met with Foodand Drug Administration officials recently to urge the agency toregulate the cigarette.   Joyce Taylor, branch director of the Arizona Lung Association inTucson, said that if the FDA doesn't get involved, smokers won'tknow what they're inhaling.   ``My theory is that regardless of what (company officials) aresaying, if they're going to light it, they're still going to havecarbon monoxide, which is one of the major irritants in smoke, andnicotine,'' she said.   ``They're not telling us what's in that packet. They don't wantthe FDA to be involved, because then they would have to telleverybody what they put into tobacco smoke.''   Company officials, however, are not making any health claims,which could invite scrutiny by the FDA.   ``If a product is sold with claims to make cigarettes safer, itis a medical device'' and subject to FDA approval, said WilliamGrigg, an agency spokesman.   ``This is not a safe or safer cigarette,'' said Richard Kampe,president of Reynolds' development divison. ``It's a cleanercigarette.'' He said the term ``smokeless cigarette'' used by themedia to describe the product is a misnomer.   The cigarette contains a packet of tobacco extracts that isheated, not burned, through a ``carbon heat source'' lit at thetip. The result is a cigarette without odor and only a trace of ashor smoke that could irritate people nearby, Kampe said.   ``It reduces many of the controversial compounds associated withburning cigarettes and virtually eliminates sidestream smoke,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
