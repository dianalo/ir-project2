Most of the moves were local, and some of the increase was attributed to a drop in mortgage rates in 1984 that made buying a home more affordable.    The bureau said the figure represents an increase of 7.1 million people over the previous year and sets an all-time record, based on data the bureau began keeping in 1948.    The increase in volume is attributed mainly to the increased size of the population.    About two-thirds of those who moved -- 30 million -- relocated within the same county, and census analysts speculate that part of the increase was due to the drop in home mortgage rates. A sharp drop in local moving coincided with an increase in rates in the early 1980s.    Overall, the bureau said 20.2% of all those over one year old moved in the 1984-1985 period, compared with 17.3% the previous year. People in the West had the highest rate of mobility -- 24.8% for the 1984-1985 period -- compared with 21.8% in the South, 19.1% in the Midwest, and 14.4% in the Northeast.    The data come from the Census Bureau's annual population survey, which relies upon census data and interviews. </TEXT></DOC>
