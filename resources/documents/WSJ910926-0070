The program calls on Japanese auto makers to provide U.S.parts makers enough information about future model changesfor those U.S. suppliers to compete for design awards beforeproduction, or &quot;design-ins,&quot; as the Japanese call them.Unfamiliarity with the needs of the Japanese auto industry isone presumed reason why few U.S. parts suppliers break intothis market.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. officials hope the plan, which is intended toincrease purchases by Japanese car makers based in the U.S.as well as Japan, will reduce the $10 billion annual deficitin auto-parts trade with Japan.   The program also provides for prospective U.S. suppliersto obtain financial assistance from the Japan DevelopmentBank and local Japanese governments for the establishment ofproduction or marketing facilities in Japan.   The eight-point plan was announced by the U.S. CommerceDepartment after several days of discussions with Japanesenegotiators and the Automotive Parts Advisory Committee, acongressionally created body representing the U.S. industry.These measures will supplement an earlier announced jointU.S.-Japanese study of the auto-parts markets in bothcountries. In addition, the program encourages Japanese automakers to use this fall's Tokyo Motor Show as an occasion for&quot;one-on-one&quot; meetings with U.S. suppliers.   The Chicago offices of the Commerce Department and theJapan External Trade Organization have been designated toreceive any complaints arising from the auto-parts trade.Japan also will call on its Office of the Trade Ombudsman toresolve trade disputes.</TEXT></DOC>
