Thornburgh asattorney general and set the stage for quick Senate approval of theformer Pennsylvania governor and three other top Justice Departmentnominees.   Thornburgh would succeed Edwin Meese III, who announced hisresignation after an independent counsel investigating his conductdeclined to file criminal charges against the controversialattorney general.   The committee approved Thornburgh by voice vote without debate.Afterwards, acting panel chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., urgedthat the Senate act before recessing this week for the summer.   The panel previously recommended approval of Harold Christensenas deputy attorney general, Francis A. Keating II as associateattorney general and Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. as chief of thecriminal division. All three nominations are before the Senate.   Thornburgh was a two-term Republican governor of Pennsylvania, achief of the Justice Department's criminal division and currentlyis director of the Institute of Politics of Harvard University'sKennedy School of Government.   Thornburgh's easy approval in the committee showed there was noaftershock from his confirmation hearing last week. During thathearing he was quizzed repeatedly about a published report that ashead of the criminal division he had a role in withholding fromCongress a 1975 report on drug trafficking by Panamanian leaders.   Thornburgh said portions of the report were withheld at the timebecause of pending investigations, and he insisted that anydecision to keep the information from Congress would have been madeby the attorney general at the time, Edward Levi.   Thornburgh said an arrangement eventually was made for theSenate to receive the report.   The nominee also pledged at the confirmation hearing to avoidthe ethical questions that dogged Meese, who was constantly dodgingconflict-of-interest allegations.   Thornburgh promised senators he would hold the JusticeDepartment to ``the highest ethical standards'' and said he wouldnot interfere with an internal investigation of Meese's conduct.   He also declared, ``I'm a strong supporter of President Reagan.His agenda is my agenda.''   Thornburgh said fighting the ``scourge of narcortics'' would behis top priority. He promised a vigorous battle against organizedcrime, public corruption and white-collar crime, while safeguardingcivil liberties.   The predecessors of Christensen and Dennis _ former DeputyAttorney General Arnold Burns and ex-criminal division chiefWilliam Weld _ announced their resignations last March to protestMeese's continued tenure in the face of the independent counsel'sinvestigation.   Keating would replace Steve Trott, who now is a federalappellate judge.</TEXT></DOC>
