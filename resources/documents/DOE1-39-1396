The model utilizes twelveordinary, coupled, first-order differential equations, obtained fromenergy balances, to describe the time-dependent variation of the surfacetemperatures (top and eight wall segments) of a partially filled POLtank. Convective heat transfer and direct and diffuse irradiation aremodeled as energy transfer into/out of the twelve lumped masses. One-dimensionaltransient conduction in the soil is considered below the tank. The modelis implemented in a computer simulation. Comparisons of the predictedtank surface temperatures with the available data show that the correcttrends and salient features are predicted. In most instances predictedand measured temperatures agree within a few degrees (C). Preliminarymodel performance indicates that the technique incorporates much of thecorrect physics and is capable of being developed into a reliable predictivemodel. Recommendations are made for further development and validation.</TEXT></DOC>
