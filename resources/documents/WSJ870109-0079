Sharp.    Goodyear, which said the moves were part of its current restructuring program, named Mr. Sharp, 45 years old, to head all of its tire-making operations. Previously, the company had separate vice presidents in charge of North American and international tire operations.    Mr. Sharp has moved swiftly from one key post to another in recent years. By appointing him to the position of corporate vice president, Goodyear passed over two vice presidents who had held the separate posts.    Since 1984, Mr. Sharp has been based in Brussels, Belgium, as director of European tire production. A year earlier, he was named director of domestic tire production. A director's position at Goodyear is just below a vice presidency.    A 22-year Goodyear veteran, Mr. Sharp previously managed production at the company's showcase Lawton, Okla., plant, considered the world's most advanced passenger radial tire facility.    Under its management consolidation program, Goodyear also announced the elimination of several upper management positions. The company said that five directors retired and that their positions were eliminated. &quot;We expect to make more such consolidations in the months ahead,&quot; Goodyear added.    The company also said that about 10%, or 644, of its salaried employees at its Akron headquarters and at certain units' headquarters took early retirement as part of a program that ended Dec. 19. In addition, a new voluntary early-retirement package is in the works for some salaried employees at several manufacturing facilities, Goodyear said. During the past two years, the company said it reduced its salaried employees at headquarters and two major tire facilities by 1,324, to 7,500.    The latest changes are part of a restructuring program triggered by a takeover attempt last year by Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier who subsequently withdrew his bid when Goodyear purchased his stake. Goodyear currently is in the midst of a $2 billion tender offer to buy back 40 million of its shares, and is trying to sell its energy and aerospace units as part of the restructuring. As previously reported, Goodyear agreed Dec. 31 to sell its wheel-making unit to a group led by current management. Terms weren't disclosed.    In the wake of Mr. Sharp's appointment, Goodyear said Joseph C. Graden, 58, corporate vice president of international tire production since 1978, is retiring. Richard A. Davies, 50, corporate vice president of North American tire manufacturing, was named vice president of manufacturing at Goodyear's Kelly-Springfield tire unit, the company said. Mr. Davies succeeds John B. Row, 63, who is retiring.    Goodyear said James K. DeVoe, 49, was named corporate vice president of worldwide advertising. Mr. DeVoe, who joined the company in 1983 as advertising director, succeeds George S. Lenox, 64, who retired Dec. 31. Mr. DeVoe's former post won't be filled, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
