(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jeff ProsiseandM;Ask the average spreadsheet Or database user to name one CADD program and theanswer will Probably be AutoCAD.andP;  This popular software lets you do justabout everything from electronically crafting 2-D drawings and layouts totransforming generic 3-D wireframes into striking shaded models.andM;AutoCAD, Release 10 ($3,000) is now supported under no fewer than eightdifferent operating systems-DOS, OS/2, VAX VMS, Xenix, Ultrix, Macintosh,Sun, and Apollo Aegis-and it supports virtually every display adapter,printer, plotter, and input device under the sun.andP;  The availability ofhundreds of third-party add-on products makes it perhaps the most extensiblepiece of software ever written for the PC.andM;Yet despite all its strength-and there are many-AutoCAD is far more versatilein 2-D than in 3-D.andP;  Although most often it will let you do what you want in3-D, you must sometimes travel a circuitous route to reach your goal.andO;Despite the vast improvements in 3-D construction options that Release 10offers over Release 9, it's still more difficult to do basic 3-D tasks inAutoCAD than it should be.andM;INSTALLATION AND INTERFACEandM;Installing AutoCAD involves nothing more difficult than copying the contentsof several diskettes to your hard disk.andP;  Configuration is an equallyuncomplicated process and is handled from the program's main menu.andP;  A specialInstallation and Performance Guide is, like all the other AutoCAD referenceand tutorial manuals, a shining example of how high-quality softwaredocumentation should be written.andM;Every AutoCAD action centers around a command.andP;  There are two ways to get atany command: either select it from an on-screen menu with a mouse or type itin.andP;  A subset of the command set is available in pull-down menus locatedalong the top of the screen.andP;  With a digitizing tablet, you have the optionof selecting commands directly from the tablet overlay.andM;Several selections contained in the pull-down menus invoke icon menus anddialog boxes.andP;  Select the Set Viewports option under the Display menu, forexample, and up pops a window with all the different screen configurationoptions.andP;  All you have to do is click on the one you want, and AutoCAD takescare of the rest.andM;The user interface is highly programmable.andP;  You can completely rearrangeAutoCAD's menus to suit your own tastes.andP;  You can even create your owncommands using AutoCAD's powerful programming language, AutoLISP.andP;  Autodesk'sguide to the AutoLISP language is so thorough and so well-written that youdon't have to be an expert to begin writing short programs that will makeyour job easier.andM;DRAFTING IN 2-DandM;It was easier to generate the 2-D mechanical part drawing required for thisreview from scratch than to first create a wireframe model and then selectorthogonal views from it.andP;  The preferred way to instance orthogonal views ofa wireframe into a flat drawing in AutoCAD is via a supplied AutoLISP programcalled PROJECT.LSP, which projects entities onto a plane and stores theresult as a block.andP;  One problem: PROJECT doesn't work with all entitytypes-3-D entities mesh and extruded surfaces are excluded.andP;  As a result, youend up recreating portions of the information for all but the simplest ofwireframes.andM;Once the issue of how to go about doing it was settled, creating the testdrawing was a breeze.andP;  AutoCAD will do just about anything in 2-D.andP;  Snapgrids, which can be set to any spacing and aspect ratio you like, make iteasy to lay in lines.andP;  Features such as filleting and trimming work with alltypes of entities-not just lines-so you don't get any nasty surprises whenyou begin refining your layouts.andP;  There are a myriad of dimensioning options,and the dimensions themselves are associative, so.andP;  if you later return tochange what you've done the dimensions scale right along.andM;AutoCAD is strong on information handling, too.andP;  Textual attributes can beattached to blocks and written out as database files, a feature that'sparticularly attractive for architectural applications.andM;One minor annoyance is that dimensioning parameters such as text height,extension line offsets, and the size of center marks are stored in systemvariables with cryptic names such as DIMTXT, DIMEXO, and DIMCEN.andP;  With morethan 30 variable names and meanings to memorize, plan on keeping the manualsready by your side until you learn your way around the system.andM;FROM LINES TO WIREFRAMESandM;The tool you'll use most often in generating 3-D wireframes is the UserCoordinate System (UCS).andP;  UCSes can be oriented at any angle and location inspace to effect a convenient frame for constructing 3-D entities.andP;  While allof Release 10's entities are inherently 3-D, not all of them can be createdin typical 3-D fashion.andP;  To create an arc that doesn't lie in the currentconstruction plane, for example, you must first create a new UCS (or recallan existing one), then lay in the arc as if you were working in 2-D.andP;  Thismakes many 3-D operations more of a chore than they should be.andM;An example of this inconvenience is found when applying a fillet to a 3-Dcorner.andP;  The fillet is always applied in the plane of the current UCS.andO;Filleting a corner on three sides requires switching among three differentUCSes.andP;  In some other 3-D programs, you can more easily apply the same filletby switching to a view that shows all three adjoining lines and thenselecting them in sequence.andM;You can offset a construction plane normal to the current UCS by specifyingan elevation and, if you like, have any geometry you create automaticallyextruded in the z-direction by specifying a thickness.andP;  The process ofgenerating the 3-D wireframe for this review involved defining one UCSlooking into the front of the part, one looking into it from the side, one inthe plane of the inclined surface, and one looking in from the bottom.andP;  Thebase was created by activating the first UCS and drawing a profile with theelevation and thickness set to 0, and then making a copy of the profilebehind the first and connecting the two with lines.andM;The wedge that sits on top of the base was created by switching to the secondUCS and drawing a five-sided polygon, duplicating it, then joining it to thecopy.andP;  The intersection of the cylindrical boss and the inclined surface wasdefined with a half ellipse in the third UCS, and the circles that form holesin the base of the part were defined in the fourth.andM;Why go to the trouble of drawing a profile, copying it, then joining theduplicate to the original when an extrusion would accomplish the same end inless time? Because drawing wireframe objects as extrusions in AutoCAD limitsyou later on.andP;  The result isn't a true wireframe but a mixture of lines andsurfaces, and PROJECT doesn't work with extrusions.andM;SURFACE APPEARANCESandM;For converting wireframes to surfaced models, AutoCAD supplies a collectionof surfacing commands.andM;The 3DFACE command creates the basic AutoCAD 3-D surface entity, an opaque 3-or 4-sided polygon.andP;  REVSURF creates a surface of revolution by swinging apolyline around an axis.andP;  TABSURF creates a tabulated surface by sweeping aprofile curve along the length of a direction vector.andP;  RULESURF creates asurface between two curves in space and EDGESURF creates a Coons patchsurface among four bounding curves.andP;  If you like, you can use the 3DMESHcommand to create contoured surfaces by defining meshes of points to serve asvertices and applying built-in smoothing algorithms to round the rough edges.andM;The only problem is that surfacing a typical wireframe is a time-consumingprocess because surfaces must be applied by hand.andP;  Unless you can write yourown AutoLISP routines to help out, surfacing around holes is particularlypainstaking.andP;  Autodesk supplies an AutoLISP program called SLOT.LSP to aid inthe surfacing in and around holes and slots, but there are many cases when itwon't help-when the hole doesn't go all the way through the part, forexample.andP;  I surfaced around the holes in the test part by dividing each ofthe circles that represents a hole into eight arcs; in turn, I used each arcas one side of a Coons patch surface.andM;Once surfaces are applied, you can remove hidden lines in AutoCAD ortransport the model to the optional AutoShade.andP;  Lights and cameras arepositioned in AutoCAD and the resulting output files processed in AutoShade.andO;The result: beautiful shaded images that depict the part far better than awireframe ever could.andM;AutoCAD passed the hatching test with flying colors.andP;  For good measure, wealso asked it to read back the DXF test file it had created earlier.andP;  As youwould expect (since Autodesk defines and maintains the .DXF specification),the resulting image was identical to the original.andM;If you need a 2-D drafting and design package that's a solid performer allaround, you can't go wrong with AutoCAD.andP;  It's one of the best.andP;  Whether youwant a package to do architectural floor plans or to draw complex mechanicalpart assemblies, AutoCAD will perform.andP;  But when it comes to 3-D work,AutoCAD is not the most capable product nor is it the easiest to use.andM;ADDING ON TO CADDandM;In order to sell as many CADD packages to as many users as possible, vendorsof mainstream PC-based CADD programs don't usually strive to include manyindustry-specific features in their software.andP;  Rather, they make sure thatthe majority of basic CADD tasks, architecture-or engineering-based, can behandled by their packages' normal feature sets.andM;But what about the circuit board designer? The architect? The land surveyor?andO;The facilities manager? The civil engineer? A thriving aftermarket of CADDadd-on software packages exists to service the needs of these  vertical&quot; CADDusers.andP;  Like clip-art packages that let you add all kinds of ready-made artto your desktop publishing projects, CADD add-ons offer incredibly specificfunctions and features designed to meet the requirements of all kinds of CADDspecialists.andP;  Some are specific to one program, and some can be used by avariety of CADD packages.andM;AutoCAD, with the lion's share of the CADD market, is the biggest beneficiaryof add-on software.andP;  DCA Engineering Software, for example, sells threeadd-on product lines for AutoCAD: Architecture, Civil Engineering andSurveying, and Structural.andP;  Each line includes several modules, such asplumbing and electrical in Architecture, and digital terrain modeling andhighways in Civil Engineering.andP;  All the programs reside within AutoCAD forseamless operation and are priced between 495 and $1,995.andP;  Contact DCAEngineering Software Inc., P.O. Box 955, Henniker, NH 03242; (603) 428-3199.andM;Several file and drawing managers are available for AutoCAD.andP;  One of the bestis Slick!, a $95 to $250 (four versions, varying in capability) add-on fromCADSystems Unlimited.andP;  Slick! sets up a point-and-shoot shell with which youcan avoid AutoCAD's clunky File Utilities menu.andP;  Browsing through yourcollection of drawings becomes faster and easier.andP;  Contact CAD SystemsUnlimited Inc., 5201 Great America Pkwy., #443, Santa Clara, CA 95054; (408)562-5762.andP;  You can also see a First Looks review of Slick! in the October 31,1989, issue of PC Magazine.andM;Fastcut Numerical Control Services has a few add-ons for Cadkey users.andO;FastSURF, for example, is a $1,895 surface modeler that lets Cadkey modelfree-form parametric bi-cubic polynomial surfaces.andP;  By usingindustry-standard surface entity types, the importation of files tomainframes and workstations is made easier.andP;  Contact Fastcut NumericalControl Services, 550 Carson Plaza Dr., #107, Carson, CA 90746; (800)752-2457, (213) 329-4449.andM;The LunaSeries of products from American Imaging Services helps users of anyCADD package, and non-CADD users as well, go back and forth between rasterand vector data.andP;  LunaView, for example, lets non-CADD users look at CADDdrawings on a LAN without having to use CADD software to do it.andP;  LunaRedlinelets those same people annotate a drawing so it can be sent back to thedesigner for modification.andP;  LunaTrace converts .andP;  PCX (raster) files to .andO;DXF (vector) files, but only on a small scale.andP;  LunaSketch, $79.95 by itself,does the same for larger (size C, D, and E) drawings, but only those that arenot too densely packed with data.andP;  The programs can be purchased in a $2,185bundle.andP;  Contact American Imaging Services Inc., 2315 Luna Rd., Carrollton,TX 75006; (214) 484-3339.andM;No matter which high-end CADD package you intend to buy, check with thevendor to see if it has a catalog of third-party add-ons designed to take thepackage into your industry-specific area.andP;  As more of these add-ons becomeavailable, CADD programs are recasting themselves as engines for verticalapplications and expanding their usability without having to expand theirbasic code.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
