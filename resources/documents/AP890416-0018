What makes their dispute unique is that F.W. de Klerk isexpected to be the next president of South Africa, and his brotherhelps lead the anti-apartheid opposition.   F.W. is head of the governing National Party and is the odds-onfavorite to succeed President P.W. Botha after elections to be heldby September.   Willem de Klerk is chief policy adviser to the new DemocraticParty, which seeks to end the Nationalists' policy of apartheid andgive voting rights to the black majority.   The deep political rift between them is notable because of deKlerks' prominence, but it is not uncommon. Among South Africa's 3million Afrikaners, families are increasingly split by differencesover apartheid, the multifaceted system of racial segregation anddiscrimination that protects white power and privileges.   There are the Breytenbach brothers _ Breyten, an exiled poetonce jailed for aiding black nationalist guerrillas, and Jan, anarmy general.   There is Gen. Constand Viljoen, former commander in chief of themilitary, and his twin brother Abram, a theologian who ranunsucessfully for Parliament on an anti-apartheid platform.   There is Klaus von Lieres, the attorney general for theJohannnesburg region, and his niece, Bettina von Lieres, presidentof the militantly anti-apartheid student council at the Universityof the Witwatersrand.   Her uncle has coordinated the prosecution of scores ofanti-apartheid activists in treason and terrorism cases.   Willem de Klerk, 60, says he maintains a close, relaxedrelationship with his younger brother, even though they argue overpolitics.   ``I try to influence him, and he tries very hard to convert meagain to the National Party platform,'' said Willem, who resignedas editor of the country's major Afrikaans-language Sundaynewspaper, Rapport, in 1987 after Botha complained to thepublishers about editorials that questioned government policy.   ``There is a lot of pressure on me from National Party peoplewho say I am an embarrassment to my brother,'' Willem said in aninterview. ``But this doesn't bother me. I am very firm on this onepoint _ as long as the National Party retains race groups as thecornerstone for a future constitution, I reject that.''   The de Klerks come from a prominent Nationalist family. Theirgreat-grandfather was a senator, and their father was a Cabinetminister.   Willem said he began to diverge from National Party thinking in1973, when he became a newspaper editor. He emerged as a spokesmanfor the relatively liberal wing of the party while his brothersupported the harsh racial segregation policies formulated by PrimeMinister Hendrick Verwoerd in the 1950s and '60s.   At one point, Willem wrote that South Africa could not andshould not be divided into black and white, an assertion he sayswas ``almost blasphemy at the time.''   His brother, 53, also has evolved politically, Willem said.   ``He's not so conservative and apartheid-oriented as he was.Maybe he will develop into a more enlightened politician, movingaway from apartheid. But I don't think he will turn the corner. Hemay be a transitional figure.''   In his one major speech since becoming National Party leader inFebruary, F.W. de Klerk sought to please both conservatives andreformers.   `Our strong emphasis on group rights ... is based on the realityof South Africa and not on an ideological obsession with racialprejudice,'' he said. ``There is no such thing as a non-racialsociety in a multiracial country.''   Willem disagrees.   ``For white people, their only hope for survival is to go intothe world of non-racialism,'' he said. ``The National Party wantsto entrench racial concepts.''   The Democratic Party _ established April 8 through a merger ofthree white liberal parties _ has no illusions about taking powerin the upcoming elections. But Willem predicted the National Partywill fare well in the elections under his brother's leadership.   ``Forgetting that it's my brother, I think voters will feel theyshould give the new man a chance,'' Willem said. ``He's a man witha different style (than Botha), more relaxed, more pragmatic.''   Despite his break with the National Party, Willem de Klerkremains very much a member of the Afrikaner establishment.   By contrast, Breyten Breytenbach lives in exile in Paris and hasrenounced his South African citizenship. He has returned to SouthAfrica only once since he was freed in 1982 after seven years inprison on a terrorism conviction for aiding the outlawed AfricanNational Congress.   During the return visit in 1986, Breytenbach was awarded anAfrikaans-language literature prize. He minced no words during anacceptance speech to a mainly Afrikaner audience.   ``I doubt you realize the extent to which we have becomedespicable to the international human awareness,'' he said. ``Ourrottenness is unique.''   Breytenbach has said he and his brother in the army, Jan, viewedeach other as dangerous enemies but nonetheless still loved eachother.   In the case of the Viljoen twins, it was the conservative,Constand, who broke away from the family's relatively liberalviews, according to his brother, Abram.   ``We both started careers in the army in 1952,'' said Abram.``After one year, I went to university to study theology, and hestayed in the army. ... Our ways parted rather severely as far aspolitical thinking goes.''   Bettina von Lieres, 24, says her relationship with her uncle is``cordial but distant.''   Being the niece of the attorney general has not hampered herinvolvement in student politics, she said. ``I've built up mycredentials as an anti-apartheid student council representative. Ifanything, there's a lot of curiosity about me, and in some ways thecuriosity has developed into respect.''</TEXT></DOC>
