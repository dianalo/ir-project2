Now the feds are creating a stir in Chicago's business arena witha massive fraud investigation of the high-stakes, frenzied futuresexchanges, the world's largest commodity markets.   But in a city that once was Al Capone's turf and has recentlyseen police convicted of protecting drug dealers, judges booted offthe bench for taking bribes and aldermen put behind bars, talk ofskulduggery in the risky business of financial futures elicits moreknowing smirks than disapproving scowls.   ``Since the political process has sanctioned corruption so long,the fact that it occurs in business is no great surprise toChicago,'' said Dick Simpson, a former alderman. ``Chicagoans arenot much surprised (that) people are stealing with big bucks asopposed to a $500 bribe. It's not shocking to the Chicagomentality.''   ``It's like a spectator sport,'' said Simpson, an associateprofessor of political science at the University ofIllinois-Chicago. ``It'll be interesting (for people) to see if 50traders go to jail or 20, or if it's a millionaire or some runner.It's like watching a bullfight or a football game. There isn'tcondemnation. There isn't outrage that it would be a crime.''   Nobody has yet been indicted in the probe of the Chicago Board ofTrade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where millions of dollars aremade and lost on future prices of items ranging from soybeans toforeign currency. The investigation purportedly involves chargesthat as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheatedcustomers and profited in illegal deals.   In the probe, dubbed Operation Sour Mash and OperationHedgeclipper, FBI agents reportedly posed as traders, leased luxuryapartments and wined and dined brokers, recording conversations withhidden tape recorders and wireless microphones disguised as pens andrings.   The probe of the trading pits follows a history of Chicagoscandals and scoundrels, ranging from men who wore cleats _ eightmembers of the 1919 Chicago White Sox who threw the World Series _to men who donned judicial black robes and fixed court cases.   At times it seems as if the city of Big Shoulders has become thehome of greased palms.   ``Things that happen here all the time would bring down agovernment in Europe,'' said political strategist Don Rose, who'sworked in several mayoral campaigns. ``One thing that contributes toChicago's reputation for corruption...is the higher tolerance (forit).''   Though citizens are sometimes jaded, Rose said, they still getannoyed. ``We accept it and we make jokes about it (corruption),''he said, ``but I think basically deep down we don't like it.''   Neither do prosecutors, who've successfully used federal laws tocombat local fraud.   Since 1972, 13 aldermen have been convicted of federal corruptioncharges. Two were convicted and two others await trial in OperationIncubator, which used FBI mole Michael Raymond to uncover influencepeddling in City Hall.   There's also been Operation Phocus, a probe of shakedownsinvolving city licensing, Operation Lantern, which investigatedalleged payoffs in city purchasing, Operation Deadfall, in which 30police officers admitted they took small bribes to steer corpses tocertain funeral homes, and Operation Greylord, the probe of thenation's largest court system in which 81 people, including 13judges and 46 attorneys have been convicted or pleaded guilty.   Those cases don't even take into account vote fraud during theheyday of the political machine when Chicago earned a dubiousreputation as a place where names from tombstones sometimes foundtheir way to the voting booth.   The machine's quid pro quo philosophy _ favors for votes _ leftopen all kinds of opportunity for fraud, Simpson said.   In fact, Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko said in ``Boss,''his book about the late Mayor Richard Daley, that there were so manydeals involving ranking machine members it was suggested Chicagochange its slogan from Urbs in Horto, or ``City in a Garden,'' toUbi Est Mea, or ``Where's mine?''   But much has changed: the machine has weakened, many abuses havebeen curbed and court orders have diluted the once-powerfulpatronage army. Some also say Chicago's image is distorted and itsproblems are no worse than other big cities.   Still, constant exposure to public corruption affects the waypeople view Chicago's business world, said Terry Brunner, directorof the Better Government Association, a local watchdog group.   ``Very few Chicagoans look at a bunch of Chicagoans ripping offinternational markets as all that bad,'' he said. ``We've adapted tothings in this city (and) laugh it off (thinking) who's gettinghurt? It isn't us. It's the fat cat investors, the big corporations.It's boys will be boys. I don't get any big sense of `Isn't thatawful?'''   One reason is few people have a financial interest or understandthe commodities markets, with its clubby atmosphere and chaoticshouting, jostling and flashing hand signals.   ``Unless one is involved in one of those markets and had someconcern about being ripped off, there's less concern than if apolitician is on the take,'' Rose said.   In this era of Wall Street scandal, there's also mistrust andeven disdain for traders.   ``The reputation of these people is right up there with dopedealers,'' Brunner said. ``You hear about these people buyingunbelievable houses and cars because of killings they made in themarket...They're such high rollers. There's absolutely no sympathyout there.''   As for the trading floors themselves, Simpson said, many expectfast-and-loose action in such a make-or-break atmosphere.   ``For most people on the outside,'' he said, ``it looks like abig poker game. It's like if you suddenly found out in Las Vegas thepoker table wasn't completely on the up and up.''   But even if the investigation results in evidence of widespreadfraud, many say the impact will be on the trading industry, ratherthan Chicago.   ``I tend to think of this as a generic financial scandal ratherthan a Chicago scandal,'' Rose said. ``I don't think (people) lookat .... (Ivan) Boesky as a New York scandal,'' he said, referring tothe notorious speculator whose prosecution for inside trading led toa broad crackdown on security abuses in Wall Street.   Yet others say Chicago can't afford any more trouble because ithurts the city, particularly its efforts to recruit investors.   ``It affects the image, which Chicago doesn't need,'' saidPatrick Healy, former head of the Chicago Crime Commission and nowexecutive director of a firm that investigates white-collar crime.``Chicago can take its place among any other city of the worldwithout this kind of nonsense.''   Healy says it's frustrating because outsiders seem to be moreinterested in Chicago's seamy side than its world-class attractions.   ``If you talk about Chicago, do they talk about the ArtInstitute? Do they talk about the beach front?'' he asked. ``Theyask, ``Is it still as bad as its always been? ... We haven't shakenthat image and that's tragic.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regional reporter,based in Chicago.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday, Feb. 12.</NOTE></DOC>
