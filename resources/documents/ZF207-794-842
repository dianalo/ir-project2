(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Connectivity Products Prospering In Otherwise Flat Hardware MarketandM;LANs and file servers are clearly the hottest segments in the computerhardware market, according to a recent computer-spending report issued by TheSierra Group.andP;  The number of installed LANs is expected to more than doubleby the end of 1989, while the number of installed file servers is expected totriple.andM;The Sierra Group, a high-technology market-research firm in Tempe, Ariz.,andO;relesed the report in September.andP;  Its conclusions are based on a survey thatpolled 844 information-systems executives from three majorindustries--finance/banking, manufacturing and insurance--about their 1989purchase plans.andM;Overall, the report suggests that a downturn is in progress in the computerindustry.andP;  According to The Sierra Group, unit growth in the mainframe andminicomputer markets has slowed to 15.2 percent and 19.1 percent,respectively, in 1989.andM;Although the number of installed PCs is expected to grow by 45.6 percent in1989, the report suggests that there are increasingly fewer empty desktopsand that corporations are in no hurry to replace their current installed basewith more advanced micros.andM;The Sierra Group's research finds that the strongest demand in the computerhardware market is for connectivity-related products.andP;  The installed base ofLAN hardware is expected to grow by 110.4 percent in 1989, with the installedbase of file servers growing by 193.1 percent.andM;Within the LAN hardware market, IBM is the clear leader.andP;  According to thereport, 60.3 percent of installed LANs in the surveyed firms use hardwaremanufactured by IBM.andP;  This share is ecpected to rise to 67.1 percent by 1990.andO;The second-ranked player in this market is Novell Inc., whose productsaccount for 18.6 percent of installed LAN hardware--a figure that is expectedto drop to 15.4 percent by 1990.andM;The report found that the other three brands of LAN hardware that account formore than 2.0 percent of installations each--3Com Corp., ATandamp;T and DigitalEquipment Corp. (DEC)--will all experience small losses in their share ofinstallations by 1990.andM;According to The Sierra Group, a significant portion of installed LANhardware will run a network operating system produced by a different vendor.andO;In many cases, that vendor will be Novell.andM;The File-Server MarketandM;IBM is also the leader in the small, rapidly growing file-server market.andO;Accounting for 54.8 percent of installed file servers at the time of thesurvey, IBM's share of this market is expected to rise dramatically to 76.6percent by early 1990.andM;Compaq Computer Corp.'s share of this market is expected to drop from 7.5percent at the time of the survey to 4.2 percent by the start of 1990.andO;Similarly, 3Com's share is expected to drop from 7.1 percent to 4.1 percentduring the same time period.andM;Novell's share of the file-server market will drop from 3.6 percent to 2.0percent by 1990.andP;  According to The Sierra Group, this drop is no surprise,due to Novell's decision to move exclusively into LAN operating systems andcease manufacturing LAN server hardware.andM;Unisys Corp.'s share of the file-server market is also expected to drop,falling from 3.3 percent of installed units at the time of the survey to 2.0percent by 1990.andP;  Similarly, DEC and AST Research Inc. are expected to losemarket share during the same period.andP;  DEC's share is expected to fall from2.0 percent to 0.9 percent by 1990, while AST's share is expected to fallfrom 1.4 percent to 0.7 percent.andP;  Clones and other brands with small piecesof the file-server market are also expected to lose market share by thebeginning of 1990.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
