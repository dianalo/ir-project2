Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said the FBI notified himTuesday afternoon that the agency did not want to declassify thefiles because they contain information about sensitive nationalsecurity matters.   The agency reviewed the files following U.S. District JudgeRobert Keeton's ruling that material in them is relevant to defenseclaims that the FBI used a former LaRouche security consultant asan informant during the investigation that led to LaRouche's July1987 indictment.   Keeton, who reviewed the files, has not indicated what in themhe considers relevant to the case. Markham said he would ask thejudge at a hearing today to list the material in the files heconsidered relevant.   If judge rules the entire files should be given to defenselawyers, or that the FBI should release portions it believes shouldbe kept secret, the government could ask the 1st U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals to overrule Keeton.   Testimony in the case has been halted four of the last fiveweeks because of battles over access to government records, mostlyfiles of Vice President George Bush, the National Security Council,the CIA and the FBI. The earliest testimony could resume is Monday.   The seven classified FBI files were given to Keeton last weekduring hearings on whether the FBI employed former LaRouchesecurity consultant Ryan Quade Emerson as an informant during theLaRouche investigation.   The FBI has said it used Emerson very briefly during theinvestigation of the political extremist, but the defense contendsthe agency is concealing Emerson's true role because he was used toentrap the defendants.   The defense raised the infiltration allegations during pretrialhearings more than a year ago, but unsucessfully pursued the theoryin court until gaining access a month ago to declassified documentsthat discuss apparent infiltration of LaRouche groups. Thedeclassified documents included a memo between former White Houseaide Oliver North and another pivotal figure in the Iran-Contrascandal.   LaRouche lawyers have accused Markham of withholding thedocuments and other evidence, and have said they would seekdismissal of the case following the infiltration hearings. Keetonalso has the option to dismiss the case if he orders the FBI torelease information and it refuses to do so.   LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche political organizationsare charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand juryinvestigation into allegations LaRouche's 1984 presidentialcampaign raised more than $2 million through credit card and loanfraud.</TEXT></DOC>
