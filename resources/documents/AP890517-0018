But even under Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ``there is alot missing,'' said Feshbach. ``And the quality of a lot of theinformation is up for grabs.''   Feshbach experienced one of the high points in his career inlate January when he was allowed to accompany a Moscowcensus-taker. He proudly shows off a pin and card designating himan official Soviet census-taker.   ``With this, I could ride on the metro and bus for free, but forfive kopeks, I was a big spender,'' says Feshbach.   Feshbach knows as much about Soviet statistics as virtuallyanyone, in this country or the Soviet Union. The government callsfrequently on his expertise, and he was to testify on Capitol Hilltoday on social change under Gorbachev.   His experience as a Moscow census-taker taught him the Soviets``are very likely to publish the figures in a more truthfulfashion'' than after the previous census in 1979. The results ofthat census dribbled out, with major gaps.   Allowing Feshbach to observe data collection was an indicationof rising Soviet candor, as was an incident at one Moscow apartmenthe visited with a census-taker.   ``Grandma could not read the card that asked her to point outher source of income. There was a long embarrassing pause,'' saidFeshbach.   ``But her daughter had a higher education,'' having completed afive-year course in engineering and economics. ``That's a tributeto what the Soviets have accomplished,'' said Feshbach.   Preliminary census results are in, and have joined the stacks ofdocuments piled in Feshbach's office. The 1989 data contain badnews for the Kremlin.   The population of the Moslem republics of Central Asia, wherethere is little industry and lots of underemployment, continued togrow at a much faster pace than the Slavic republics, where workersare needed. Russia grew by 7 percent, compared to 28 percent forTurkmenistan, 22 percent for Kirghizia, 29 percent for Uzbekistan,and 34 percent for Tadzhikistan.   Feshbach, his appetite whetted, traces his finger along thelines of numbers and Cyrillic characters to figure how many peopledied in the Armenian earthquake last December.   Pulling down Soviet statistical handbooks from his officeshelves, Feshbach calculates the population of Armenia had beengrowing by about 50,000 per year, adds that to the 1988 figure,subtracts the 1989 figure, and concludes there are ``approximately250,000'' fewer people in Armenia than there would have been withno earthquake.   The official Soviet death toll: 25,000. Without more data, it isimpossible to explain the discrepancy.   Similar methodology has produced headline-grabbing results overthe years.   In 1980, Feshbach reported that infant mortality in the SovietUnion had risen 36 percent since 1971, to at least 31 deaths perthousand births, compared to 12 deaths per thousand births in theUnited States.   Soviet officials were aware of the problem, and had censoredinfant mortality statistics from their publications since 1975. ButFeshbach unearthed data the censors missed.   Lashing out at that they called ``lurid accounts'' appearing inthe West, Soviet officials called a news conference in Moscow toclaim the rise in infant mortality was due to better reporting. TheSoviets now acknowledge that health care needs improving.   Feshbach has mined other Soviet secrets.   In the mid-1960s, he reported the Soviets had a severe laborshortage. Not until 1976 did Kremlin leaders admit that.   He has been predicting for years that the exploding populationof Central Asia would pose problems, particularly in the military.Recent Soviet articles have confirmed that the Central Asiaconscripts have trouble mastering the Russian language and thecomplicated machinery of modern war.   Among the puzzles Feshbach is working from the latest census isthe evacuation pattern after the nuclear accident at Chernobyl inApril 1986.   ``We already know they evacuated 116,000 people. They told usthat,'' he said. Although preliminary data is sketchy, it shows amarked migration from surrounding administrative regions, oroblasts.   Chernigovskaya oblast, with its administrative center 50 milesdue east of Chernobyl, lost 6 percent of its population.Kirovgradskay oblast, 230 miles southeast of Chernobyl, lost onepercent of population.   Vinnitskaya oblast, 180 miles southwest of Chernobyl, lost 6percent of its population. Sumskaya oblast, centered 200 miles eastof Chernobyl, lost 2 percent of its population. Zhitomirskayaoblast, 100 miles southwest of Chernobyl, lost 3 percent of itspopulation.</TEXT></DOC>
