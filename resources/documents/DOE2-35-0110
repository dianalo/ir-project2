These experiments were principally designedto contribute to the assessment of environmental consequences of a nuclearwar (``nuclear winter''). We believe, however, that the results and theexperimental methodology used are of interest to the broader fire researchcommunity. The smoke particle sampling and analysis methods were originallydeveloped for studies of atmospheric aerosol particles. In these atmosphericapplications, it is important to acquire at a minimum information aboutparticle mass, particle size distribution and chemical composition ofthe particles as a function of particle size. Which specific chemicalspecies and compounds are analyzed is determined by the objectives ofthe particular study. Depending on these objectives, specific gaseouscompounds may be monitored, particularly those that serve as precursorsfor the formation of aerosols by various gas-to-particle conversion processes.6 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
