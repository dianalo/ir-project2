A Palestinian emerged from a mosque and stabbed a Jerusalempoliceman in the stomach as he stood guard near the route whereGood Friday pilgrims traced the steps of Christ as he carried hiscross.   Police and soldiers were out in force to guard Christians asthey remembered Christ's death and Jews celebrated the start of theweek-long Passover festival.   Hundreds of pilgrims carried wooden crosses along the ViaDolorosa _ the route Jesus walked to his crucifixion _ in thewalled Old City, but the crowd was smaller than usual. The GreekOrthodox church canceled three processions planned before itsobservance of Easter on April 10.   An Israeli police lieutenant was stabbed in the stomach about 20yards from the Good Friday procession, apparently by a worshiperemerging from prayers at the sacred Al Aqsa Mosque. The policemanwas reported in fair condition, and a Palestinian was arrested.   The government lifted an order under which the occupied landswere sealed off for three days, and it ended a round-the-clockcurfew in Gaza.   In addition to the two deaths reported Friday, a thirdPalestinian died overnight of a gunshot wound to the head inflictedWednesday. The Arab death toll stands at 127 since violence beganDec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N.figures, and an Israeli soldier also has been killed.   Army and Arab reports differed on what happened in theconfrontation between soldiers and Palestinians at Idna, a villageseven miles west of Hebron in the West Bank.   Officials at Hebron's Alia Hospital and Arab journalists saidsoldiers stormed the village mosque to subdue Palestinians hurlingrocks and bottles after prayers.   They said Jamal Tamizi, 20, died after being hit in the headwith a tear gas canister and five bullets struck Ishak NimrSalameh, 18, in the chest and head. The reports said 25 people werewounded.   According to the army, soldiers opened fire when they weresurrounded by dozens of Arab rioters, some flinging bottles filledwith flaming gasoline.   Last week, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin authorized troops tofire on Arabs who throw firebombs.   In Jerusalem, officials at Mukassad Hospital said an Arab youthfrom the Old City's Moslem quarter was wounded in the leg.   Hundreds of Arabs have been wounded since riots began among the1.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israelhas occupied since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967Middle East war.   Israel radio said 40 soldiers have been injured, including onewho is paralyzed and another in a coma.   About 35 women, many of them elderly, emerged from the Nasrmosque in the West Bank town of El Bireh on Friday shaking theirfists and chanting: ``By our blood and spirit we will redeemPalestine!'' Soldiers fired tear gas to disperse them.   In Ramallah, stores and the central vegetable market opened forthe first time since the territories were shut down Monday night.During the three days, soldiers forced shopkeepers to close duringthe only hours PLO leaflets said they could open.   Abed Hamouri said Israeli economic measures, intended to turnmiddle-class Palestinians against the rebellion, had no impact onunderground activists. He is co-owner of 24 commuter buses.   ``The solution is not in the hands of the people who ownshops,'' Hamouri said. ``I'm not afraid of the military governor.I'm afraid of the underground leaders I don't know.''   His reference was to masked men who order shopowners when toopen or close and threaten those who do not comply.   Shmuel Goren, government adviser on the occupied territories,contended that Israel's methods were working.   ``We have to divide the population,'' he said on Israel radio.``We see a great number of people who certainly feel tired and wantvery much to stop these things.''   In the Gaza Strip, the army reimposed 24-hour curfews on theNusseirat and Beach refugee camps and on the villages Abassan, BeitHanoun and Bani Suheila. A five-hour nightly curfew was restored inthe rest of the 6-mile-long coastal strip.   Army spokesmen said 300 Palestinians were arrested while Gazawas closed.</TEXT></DOC>
