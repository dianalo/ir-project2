After the lights went out, she heard people screaming and lookedout to see a couple who lived in a trailer behind the club puttheir children in a truck.   ``I saw them get into the street, then I just saw the water ripthrough,'' she said.   The family she saw made it to high ground in time, she said.</TEXT><TEXT>   Tom Allison watched the storm rage through Wegee Creek onThursday night and thought nothing of it. He soon changed his mind.   ``We were in my back yard ... but when the rain started blowingin, we went inside,'' Allison said Monday. ``We hadn't been insidefive minutes when somebody looked out the back door and said, `Oh,my God.'   ``Some people didn't have a chance to see it coming. ... We did,or we wouldn't have gotten out. It's simple as that,'' he said.   Allison and his sister, Vicki, who lived nearby, lost everything.   ``Who would think of flood insurance for a 10-foot wide creekthat never gets over a foot deep?'' Allison said. ``What would youneed flood insurance for?''   ``But within a half-hour from the time it started raining,vehicles and houses and trailers were moving down the creek,''Allison said.   ``We watched a minute, a minute and a half, and here comesanother building, and it ripped through the pavilion where we hadbeen sitting.   ``Then we saw (Ms. Allison's) trailer start to move, and wedecided it was time to get out of Dodge.''   They fled to higher ground across the road.</TEXT><TEXT>   Chuck Vogt, the Belmont County coroner's investigator, stood ona railroad trestle and watched National Guardsmen and Coast Guarddivers drag a wrecked car from the mouth of Wegee Creek.   He watched a moment longer and then scratched his head.   ``You know, we had a mock disaster drill planned for some timelater this month,'' he said. ``I don't think we'll need it now.''</TEXT><TEXT>   ``The house can be renovated, gradually,'' said 69-year-oldWarren Wright of Pipe Creek, as he and his daughter, Inez, ofSteubenville, left the disaster information center at the JeffersonSchool in Shadyside.   ``But the vinyl siding is gone, the furniture is gone, my truckis gone, my workshop is gone, my tool shed is gone and the yardlooks like a battlefield.''   His voice grew huskier.   ``I built the home myself, 33 years ago.''   Wright said he was reading on his bed when the flood struck.   ``I wasn't worried ... until I received a telephone call sayinga flash flood was coming,'' he said. ``I thought he was pulling myleg. ... I headed up the road to check on some disabled neighbors.   ``The creek came up across the road, and I thought, `Well, Ibetter go back and move some vehicles.' But when I started back Icouldn't get back.''   Wright said he lost most of his possessions but no familymembers.   ``I still got off lucky,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
