Seventy five of the 800 employees at thesite were involved in processes where mercury was used. Details wereprovided concerning engineering controls in effect for mercury-fillingcontainers, seals, process features that control mercury, mercury removalin product purification, mercury drain troughs and collection buckets,floor grating, floor sealant, and the maintenance program. Personal protectiveequipment, work practices, biological-monitoring programs, air-contaminantmonitoring programs, and medical programs were also examined. The existingcontrol strategies at the site appeared adequate in maintaining mercuryvapor levels below the OSHA requirements. The integrity of process equipmentin the chlor/alkali manufacturing process was vital due to the volumeof elemental mercury and mercury containing product flows. It is recommendedthat an in-depth study not be conducted at the site as sufficient informationon mercury controls was obtained during the preliminary site visit.</TEXT></DOC>
