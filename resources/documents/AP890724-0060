The president, meeting with members of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee and other leading senators, also said an espionageinvestigation at the State Department doesn't help U.S.-Sovietrelations.   Bush said the B-2 and the Strategic Defense Initiative, both ofwhich are threatened with deep cuts on Capitol Hill, are essentialto the U.S. defense and to arms talks with the Soviets.   ``I strongly support what we sent up there to the Hill. SDI, inmy view, is critical,'' said Bush.   The B-2, he added, ``is a revolutionary plane with revolutionarytechnology. Again I would strongly urge your support for that.'' Healso appealed for support for funds for the Midgetman missile andfor making the MX missile mobile.   ``We need the utmost flexibility in terms of arms control,''said Bush.   Asked by reporters how he could justify the expense of the B-2,costing $70 billion for 132 planes, or $530 million apiece, Bushreplied, ``I justify it because I think the prime responsibility ofthe president is the national security of the United States.''   Asked about the investigation of top State Department officialFelix Bloch as a possible Soviet spy, Bush said it ``is a veryserious matter and it will be thoroughly investigated.''   ``The minute I heard about it I was aggrieved because it is avery tragic thing should these allegations be true,'' said Bush.   Asked what impact it might have on U.S.-Soviet relations, Bushsaid, ``It doesn't help any. ... Espionage goes on. I don't thinkit helps when you have high-visibility cases. but I thinkregrettably it says more, if it's true, about an individual who isalleged to have passed secrets to the Soviets, which is very bad.''   Bush said he was not sure how seriously U.S. security may havebeen compromised. Bloch was the No. 2 official at the U.S. embassyin Vienna.   On Sunday, Bush's budget chief said the president has ruled outany suggestion from Democrats that he accept future tax increasesin exchange for an immediate cut in the capital gains tax.   Bush, kicking off the week with an unusually hectic schedule,also planned to meet with South Korean Foreign Minister Choi HoJoong.   Another White House visitor was Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley,son and namesake of the city's legendary mayor. And Bush wasmeeting with Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.   Bush has been negotiating with House Speaker Thomas Foley andRep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the Ways and Means chairman, on arevenue package.   White House budget director Richard Darman said Sunday, ``Webelieve that right now, we have the votes for a satisfactorycapital gains proposal in the Ways and Means Committee. Our onlyproblem is ... (House Speaker Thomas F. Foley and committeeChairman Dan Rostenkowski) won't actually bring it up for a vote.''   Darman said the president was not willing to agree to exchange alower capital gains levy now for increases in other taxes next yearor later.   ``The president is firmly committed to his pledge not to raisetaxes,'' Darman said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''   Asked how long Bush intended to stick by his no-tax-increasepledge, Darman said, ``For the time being, let's assume forever _but I don't know exactly what that means.''   The Democratic leaders contend lowering the capital gains rate _now 28 to 33 percent _ would hurt the Treasury and help only thewealthy.   Darman said it would stimulate growth and raise Treasuryrevenues.</TEXT></DOC>
