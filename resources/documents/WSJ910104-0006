Israeli and U.S. officials say Jordan's King Hussein hasdispatched several thousand troops and construction workersto the border area with Israel to revamp defensive positionsthat haven't been manned for years. The military move, alongIsrael's longest and least-fortified border, coincides with acabinet reshuffling in Amman that has given a boost to theMuslim Brotherhood party, a fundamentalist group thatespouses Israel's destruction.</LP><TEXT>   The Jordanian maneuvers, both political and military,reflect mounting pressures on King Hussein from severalsides, say Israeli officials and Mideast experts. Though theking has toned down his support for Iraqi President SaddamHussein since the beginning of the Gulf crisis -- indeed, themonarch is in Europe this week trying to broker a solution tothe confrontation -- the Jordanian leader is cooperatingmilitarily with Iraq, Israeli officials say. Jordan's move tobolster its border, these officials say, may be a warning toIsrael that it will resist any use of its territory as abattlefield in an Israel-Iraq war.   &quot;We see no reason to believe that Jordan has anything butdefensive intentions,&quot; says Danny Naveh, spokesman for theIsraeli Defense Ministry. &quot;We haven't taken any irregularmeasures in response&quot; to Jordan's moves.   In fact, Israel has repeatedly stated in recent days, bothpublicly and through diplomatic channels, that it has noaggressive designs on Jordan. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamirand other Israeli leaders have said openly that they favorKing Hussein and his Hashemite regime to the apparentalternatives: Muslim fundamentalists and Palestinians.   But Israeli friendship is the last thing King Husseinneeds right now, at least publicly. He rules a nation wherethe population is mostly Palestinian, though the king doesn'tshare that heritage, where the Parliament is controlled byIslamic fundamentalists, though the ways of the king and hisAmerican wife are decidedly Western, and where the easternborder faces Iraq, though the throne has long tilted towardthe U.S.   Legendary for his survival skills, King Hussein nowappears to be hedging his bets on every front, Israelianalysts say. In addition to the defensive moves aimed atIsrael, the Jordanian government Tuesday named an outspokensupporter of Iraq, Taher Masri, a Palestinian from the WestBank, to succeed Marwan Qassem as foreign minister. And, asexpected since recent elections, Prime Minister Mudar Badrannamed five Muslim Brotherhood members to cabinet postsgoverning social, health, education, religious and legalaffairs.   To Israelis, however, King Hussein's most importantbalancing act has yet to be tested.   &quot;Are the Jordanians creating a situation in which theiranti-aircraft batteries are becoming part of Iraq's airdefense?&quot; asks Ehud Ya'ari, Mideast commentator for Israelitelevision. &quot;If Israeli jets fly over Jordan, will the radaroperators in Iraq see the same screens as the guys inJordan?'   A spokesman for the Israeli military declined to commenton the extent of Jordan's military cooperation with Iraq. ButBenni Begin, a member of the Defense and Foreign AffairsCommittee of the Israeli Knesset, or parliament, sayslow-echelon field commanders from the Iraqi military havemade regular visits to the Jordan-Israel border in the pastyear.   To Mr. Begin, son of former Israeli Prime MinisterMenachem Begin, and to many other Israelis, the growing powerof the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan and King Hussein'sembrace of Saddam Hussein can mean only one thing: thatIsrael will never give up the West Bank, the buffer zonebetween itself and Jordan.   &quot;That's very clear,&quot; says Mr. Begin.</TEXT></DOC>
