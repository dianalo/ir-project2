The volume fraction and morphology of bainitewere controlled by isothermal holding for different periods at two levelsof bainite transformation temperature before quenching in water. Thesize of martensite particles became finer with increasing volume fractionof bainite in the tri-phase steel. Lower bainite and upper bainite wereobserved in the tri -phase steel by transmission electron microscopy.The improvement in ductility (elongation and reduction of area) withincreasing volume fraction of bainite in the tri-phase steel was attributedto dispersion of fine martensite particles and less hard bainite, thatresulted in higher work hardening and relaxation of stress concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
