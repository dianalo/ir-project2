While the company picnic and Christmas party still rank amongthe most popular extracurricular activities, some companies arerelying on more creative means to break down corporate hierarchiesand build up team spirit.   ``Having fun is absolutely critical because it energizespeople,'' said Eric Flamholtz, professor of human resources at thegraduate school of management at the University of California, LosAngeles. ``But, you want to simultaneously develop new skills andinsights that can be applied in a practical sense to make theorganization more effective.''   Take an all-day seminar for about 70 executives, sales managersand support staff at a Los Angeles sales division of ATandamp;TCommunications.   Following lunch, guest speaker Nigel Livingwage approached thedais, introduced himself as an expert in computer accessing, took asip of coffee and dropped ``dead.''   Livingwage, also known as Buzz Noe, is an actor and partner inCapers, a company that plans murder mysteries, these days almostexclusively for corporate clients, including Pacific Bell, BlueCross and Honeywell.   The ATandamp;T employees had been given subtle clues throughout themorning that something was amiss: a shifty waiter who never setdown a coffee pot, an appearance by an eccentric British mysterywriter (played by Noe's wife and partner Lynn Chaplin) and aJapanese businessman, who was really a Caucasian actor wearingmake-up.   ``Mr. Moto (the Japanese character) was so convincing despitehis phony appearance that three ATandamp;T employees approached himtrying to sell him some telecommunications services,'' Noe said.   Entertainment aside, the amateur sleuthhounds, now divided intosix teams, got down to the issue at hand: Who killed the speakerand why?   After a while, questionnaires were handed out to be answered bythe employees individually. Identical forms were then handed toeach team to be answered as a whole.   The Capers staff then graded the surveys and plotted statisticscomparing the individual scores to the team scores.   ``The whole idea is that the group should do as well if notbetter than the individuals,'' Ms. Chaplin said. ``If that wasn'tthe case, it became clear that they didn't pool their resources ordepend on the person who had the most correct answers.''   The exercise, Ms. Chaplin said, allows the teamwork concept toget out of the corporate environment and forces people who do notnormally interact to communicate with each other.   ``It puts everyone on the same level,'' she said. ``It gives thebig guy the opportunity to see that he always has something tolearn from his support staff.''   But such games are not without their critics.   ``It's gimmicky,'' said Robert O. Metzger, adjunct professor atthe University of Southern California, and director of the campus'sCenter for Operations Management.   ``It's playing to management's natural desire to simple, quicksolutions to what in effect are very complex and involvedmanagement issues,'' he said.   ``When you look at some of the efforts that have gone intoimproved teamwork, you find that Ford Motor Co. spent eight yearsand several million dollars before employees felt they would not berisking their jobs if they stopped the assembly line because ofwhat they believed was a problem in quality control,'' Metzger said.   Flamholtz, the UCLA professor, agreed.   ``Teambuilding activities that most closely resemble everydayworking situations are always more effective than those thatdon't,'' he said.   But ATandamp;T branch manager Dennis Kruse, who organized the murdermystery event, said his goal was not to solve his division'smanagement problems.   ``It certainly helped to break down barriers,'' Kruse said.``That's the first step.   ``If it's fine tuning you're looking for, of course, you'll needmore time and a more structured format.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday Oct. 13</NOTE></DOC>
