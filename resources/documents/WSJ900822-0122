The decision to integrate the country rapidly into the ECis likely to be approved by the 12 EC member governments.This means East Germans will reap EC aid and subsidies -- anda dose of economic shock.</LP><TEXT>   The commission said EC policies would be implemented inEast Germany as soon as Oct. 15, the date favored forunification by most German political forces. But the callyesterday for the earlier date prompted a split in EastGermany's Social Democratic Party.   Upon unification, East German &quot;citizens . . . will haveall the rights and obligations of the citizens of the EC,&quot;Commission President Jacques Delors said, referring to thefree movement of people, goods and services throughout thecommunity, as well as EC policies on agriculture, energy,transport and competition. Among exceptions, environmentalnorms won't have to be implemented before 1996, and EastGerman industry will have until 1993 to bring its chemical,pharmaceutical and food products up to EC standards. But thecommission made clear it wants few exceptions. For example,EC standards on the safety of nuclear power plants will applyupon unification, effectively forcing all five of EastGermany's nuclear power plants to close.   Mr. Delors also sought to dispel fears that the cost ofrescuing the East German economy will deprive poor regions inSpain, Portugal, Italy, Greece or Ireland of EC subsidies.</TEXT></DOC>
