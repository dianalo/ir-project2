A comedian holds a dog leash attached to a collar. Thecollar hangs in the air, about dog height, but there's no dog.;   AndreaThurber says a lot of dogs in Sunnyvale are invisible, never taken outside bytheir owners because there are few places to go, and some people would like itto remain so.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  OWNERS SEEK PARKS FOR DOGSSUNNYVALE STUDY FAILS TO FIND SPACE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But the issue of dog parks, half-acre plots behind fences in city parkswhere the animals can run free, has persisted doggedly for almost two years,after city council member Robin Parker brought it up.;   The parks andrecreation department first delivered a report on the matter in July 1990.While the report recommended against joining the ranks of such cities as PaloAlto, Berkeley and San Bruno by establishing a dog park, the council asked thecity staff to look into doing so on a pilot basis anyway.;   That study, whichgoes to the council Tuesday, concludes that Sunnyvale lacks suitable placesfor a dog park.;   Thurber, who heads Dog Owners of Greater Sunnyvale, orDOGS, said the staff decision was based on a notion that there aren't any goodplaces because the dog park couldn't be on school property or next to aschool.;   &quot;We're going to ask them,&quot; she said, &quot;to remove the requirementthat it not be at a school . . . or they could have special times for dogs andother times for people.&quot;;   Enjoying a playing field previously used by a dogmay not appeal to some people, but Thurber said that could be remedied byinstallation of pooper scoopers, convenient bags dispensed in some city parksfor disposal of dog waste.;   Pilot park proposed; Parker said several single,career-oriented pet owners brought the issue to her, and she expects to seesome of them Tuesday night. She has been trying to persuade other councilmembers to try a pilot park, but &quot;whether it's going to pass or not, I have noidea.&quot;;   Thurber has a German shepherd, Casey. She knows people areuncomfortable sharing a park with such large dogs running free, but she saidthat's one of the most cogent arguments for a dog park. &quot;People would knowthey (the dogs) would be there, and you wouldn't be making peopleuncomfortable,&quot; Thurber said.;   Room for exercise; As for all those invisibledogs, Thurber estimated there are 17,000 dogs in the city, and she hopes theowners of some will show up at the meeting, in addition to the 35 members ofDOGS.;   Many dogs that should be exercised never get the chance, Thurbersaid. &quot;It's an urban community. There's just no place to go,&quot; she said.&quot;Unless you're physically able to run with your dog, you're out of luck. . . .It's just an issue that is going to keep cropping up the more urban the areabecomes.&quot;; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Sunnyvale City Council meets at 8 p.m.Tuesday at City Hall, 456 W. Olive Ave.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LELAND JOACHIM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910819  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  499  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, August 19, 199100232082,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
