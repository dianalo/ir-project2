This was made blindingly clear during a recentwedding reception when, with the band playing a spirited version of BobSeger's &quot;Old Time Rock 'n' Roll,&quot; I spotted a fellow on the dance floor whoappeared to be having some sort of seizure.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE QUIET DESPERATION OF THE DANCING-IMPAIRED  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cowherd is a columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  </MEMO><TEXT>     As a concerned citizen, my first reaction, naturally enough, was to callfor an ambulance and a paramedic with an adequate supply of phenobarbital --at least 400 cc's, judging by how agitated the man seemed.;    Then I ran upon the dance floor to see if I could be of assistance. But even before I couldthrow a tablecloth over the fellow and wrestle him to the ground so hewouldn't hurt himself, his wife stopped me.;    No, she said, there wasnothing wrong with her husband, at least from a medical standpoint. He wasonly dancing.;    Even when I reminded her that dancing, no matter how looselydefined, is a series of begin rhythmic and patterned bodily movements, sheinsisted her husband was attempting just that.;    Watching him for a while,two things in particular struck me about the poor guy, aside from hisunfortunate choice of a lime-green sport coat with wide lapels and brown,flared slacks.;    No. 1, there was no question that he was absolutely theworst dancer I had ever seen in my life.;    And No. 2, apparently thisbulletin had been withheld from him for many years now. Because instead ofsitting out each dance, which would be the decent thing to do given hiscomplete lack of grace and coordination, this fellow danced all night.;    Atthe very least, he should have considered wearing some sort of disguise -- orperhaps a paper bag over his head -- thereby lessening the terriblehumiliation for his family.;    Instead, the man single-handedly set the artof dance back at least 200 years, in addition to prompting God knows how manyunnecessary calls to 911.;    The point of all this is not to be mean-spirited(at least not directly), or to suggest that I myself could dance any betterthan our unfortunate friend in the Age of Aquarius get-up.;    No, I am thefirst to admit to an inability to dance. In fact, I have been dancing-impairedsince roughly the age of 16 when, while attempting some sort of fast dance(the Frug? the Mashed Potato?) with Sandy Mancuso during a &quot;Battle of theBands&quot; at Monroe-Woodbury High School, I heard my gym teacher, Mr. Schmidt,inquire: &quot;Exactly what the hell are you doing out there?&quot; Old man Schmidt wasa pain in the neck and probably an ex-Nazi in hiding, but on this subject hewas right on. I had no idea what I was doing on the dance floor. Still don't,as a matter of fact.;    But here (finally) is the point: Unlike our oddlydressed friend, I know better than to hit the dance floor and gyratemeaninglessly to the discomfort of my partner and all those around me.;   Which is why at weddings -- unless I've had a few too many beers -- you'llfind me sitting out the fast dances. Instead, I'll probably be turning to thenice young couple on my right and saying: &quot;Why, no, you didn't show me yourbaby pictures!&quot;;    Unfortunately, despite the tremendous strides of modernscience, little help is available for those of us who are dancing-impaired.;   There are no telethons featuring an exhausted Jerry Lewis, slicked-down hairglistening with perspiration and tuxedo bow tie askew, peering at footage of astumbling man on a nightclub dance floor and sobbing: &quot;Look at him. He . . .he has absolutely no coordination!&quot;;    There are no catchy slogans (&quot;What IfYou Had Two Left Feet?&quot;) to raise the national consciousness.;    There are noshots of George Bush on the 6 o'clock news sitting at his desk in the OvalOffice and signing a bill freeing up millions of federal dollars for thedevelopment of a cure for dance impairment.;    Faced with this nationalindifference to their plight, the dancing-impaired tend to lead lives of quietdesperation, hastily excusing themselves and fleeing to the bar or the restrooms whenever the band strikes up a tune.;    At least most of us have thedecency to leave the room. But there's always one or two bad apples in everybunch.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Kevin Cowerd column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910725  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  773  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 25, 199100207124,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
