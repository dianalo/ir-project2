The storm threatened heavy snow from the Great Lakes to northernNew England, the National Weather Service said.   Police in Minnesota blamed three highway fatalities Monday onsnow from the big low-pressure system. Icy roads were blamed forthree highway deaths in Montana on Sunday.   The storm system had dropped up to 4 feet of snow in parts ofthe Sierra Nevada during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, and,with a boost from the Great Salt Lake's moisture, it left just asmuch at Utah ski areas by Monday.   ``Hallelujah is the cry from the ski resorts,'' weather servicemeteorologist William Alder said. ``The cheers from the ski resortscan be heard in the valley, but the cries from the morningcommuters in Salt Lake and Davis counties might drown them out.''   Solitude ski resort got 52 inches of snow, Brighton 47, Alta 46and Snowbird 44.   An avalanche warning was in effect on Utah's northern Wasatchrange in some back-country areas and steep slopes, said BruceTremper, director of the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center.   ``There's good skiing out there (in the back country), but it'sdangerous,'' Tremper said. The search resumed today for across-country skier missing since Saturday in Logan Canyon.   In South Dakota, Galena, high in the Black Hills, got 18 inchesof snow Monday. Four inches fell at Mount Rushmore, delaying astructural analysis of the monument's granite faces.   The moisture was good news for winter wheat farmers.   ``Nothing better could happen, the truth be known,'' said BenHandcock, executive director of the South Dakota Wheat Commission.   Up to 6 inches of snow combined with gusty winds made fordifficult driving in Minnesota.   ``The wind is so bad you can't even see anywhere to go,'' saidClarence Steenblock, operator of the Blue Star Motel in Windom.   Rain and wet snow mixed with high winds and rapidly fallingtemperatures to coat power lines with a thick layer of ice, causingoutages in Marshall in southwestern Minnesota.   The outage shut off fans that kept a canvas bubble over theMarshall hockey rink inflated. As the covering sagged, it waspunctured by light poles inside the rink, and wind whipped thecanvas and tore the holes further. Damage was estimated damage at$20,000 to $30,000.   Ice combined with up to 2 inches of snow and 40 mph gusts madedriving treacherous in northern Iowa. The Highway Patrol shut downInterstate 29 between Whiting and Sloan for most of Monday nightafter about 200 cars and trucks got stuck.   Snowfall totaled about 2-4 inches in northern Wisconsin.   ``The roads are ugly,'' said Jeanne Cox, a dispatcher for theOneida County Sheriff's Department.   Officials were trying to determine today if a tornado toucheddown Monday in Butler County, Ohio, during high winds that knockedout power and uprooted trees in southwest Ohio and northernKentucky.   In Michigan, power company crews were busy early today restoringpower to nearly 30,000 homes on the Lower Peninsula. Winds up to 50mph, slushy snow, heavy rain and lightning caused the outages andknocked down at least one house and blew off several home's roofs.   The weather service said accumulations along the shore of LakeSuperior could reach more than a foot today.   In Ionia County, strong winds knocked down at least one houseand two garages, and roofs were blown off two houses and a mobilehome, authorities said. No injuries were reported.   Severe winds also tore roofs off and uprooted large trees inButler County, Ohio. Most of the power knocked out was restoredtoday.   Thunderstorms in Indiana produced half-inch hail south ofRochester. The most serious storm damage was reported at FortWayne's Baer Field, where winds clocked at 58 mph toppled a parkedairplane and damaged a hangar.</TEXT></DOC>
