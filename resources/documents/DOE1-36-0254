The variations may be characterizedas a clustering of flare events separated by periods of quiescent emission.A harmonic analysis reveals no significant periodicities in either theentire 7 yr data set or in subsets corresponding to active and quiescenttime frames. There is, however, broadband power from roughly 50 to 200days which fades during 1985. Moreover, it is found that the temporalpower distribution of SS 433 at both frequencies strongly resembles l/fnoise. Finally, a comparison with 408 MHz data (Bonsignori-Facondi, etal. 1986) shows variations in the light curve to lag those at 2695 and8085 MHz by approximately 4 days. 20 references.</TEXT></DOC>
