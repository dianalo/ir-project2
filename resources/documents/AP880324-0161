White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied that Reagan hadscheduled his fourth summit with the Soviet leader merely as awrap-up to the president's second term.   The May 29-June 2 Moscow summit ``will be well prepared; therewill be substance to discuss; there will be good prospects forsuccess,'' Fitzwater told reporters.   He added that ``there will be a number of important andsubstantive and meaningful issues to be resolved and all of thosethings will occur at the Moscow summit. It meets all the criteriathat needs to be met.''   If U.S. and Soviet negotiators can unravel disagreements overthe next nine weeks, Reagan and Gorbachev will sign a sweeping pactto cut long-range nuclear weapons arsenals.   ``I think this summit will be quite productive, well defined,well prepared,'' the spokesman said without citing any specificareas of agreement.   Fitzwater was queried about summit prospects amid indicationsfrom both Secretary of States George Shultz and Soviet foreignminister Eduard Shevardnadze on Wednesday that little agreement wasfound on an array of troublesome issues.   Prior to Reagan's first summit sessions with the Soviet leader,the White House had repeatedly insisted Reagan would not meet withGorbachev unless substantive progress on matters such as armscontrol could be achieved.   Fitzwater said the success of the Shultz-Shevardnadze sessionsthis week lies in the fact that both sides had ``faced all thetough problems'' and that there is no confusion about where bothsides stand.   ``We made enough progress to keep going and presumably we willmake more in the days ahead,'' the spokesman said.   Fitzwater also announced that Reagan had accepted an invitationfrom the Finnish government to travel to Helsinki from May 26 toMay 29, prior to the summit. Afterward, he will stop in London onthe way home.   The president will deliver an address while in Helsinki andmight deliver another in London, the spokesman said, but he gave noother details.   Shultz, in a meeting with reporters Wednesday evening, was askedabout chances for reaching an arms control agreement in time for itto be signed at the summit.   ``I wouldn't want to lay you odds,'' he responded.   The road to the summit is also littered with divisions onCentral America, the Middle East, and above all, Afghanistan, whereplans by the Soviets to end their 8-year intervention have hit asnag.   Reagan has been talking about going to the Soviet Union sincethe autumn of 1985 when he and Gorbachev were in Geneva for theirfirst meeting. Not since President Nixon visited Moscow in 1974 andPresident Ford went to Vladivostok later that year has an Americanchief of state traveled to the land Reagan once called ``an evilempire.''   The summit's proposed highlight would be the signing of a treatyto scrap 30 percent to 50 percent of the superpowers' long-rangebombers, missiles and submarines. But major differences remain,despite pronouncements that progress was made during Shevardnadze'sthree days of talks in Washington.   Asked if a treaty would be ready in time, Reagan said, ``I haveno way of answering that.'' Shevardnadze called it ``apossibility.''   The envisioned treaty would set a ceiling of 6,000 warheads onlong-range missiles and bombers, but the two sides must still setsub-limits on the various types of weapons and decide how to verifycompliance with a pact.   The compliance issue is especially thorny because the weaponsare among the hardest to detect in the superpower arsenals:sea-launched cruise missiles, ballistic missiles on submarines andcruise missiles launched from bombers.   Shevardnadze said progress has been made on verification, but``much more work needs to be done,'' at the continuing round oftalks in Geneva and at two more Shultz-Shevardnadze sessions, firstin Moscow April 21-25 and then in the middle of May at anunspecified site.   Shultz and Shevardnadze portrayed their governments as workingwith a common purpose to fit pieces of the arms control puzzle intime for the summit. They made no effort to hide their sharpdisagreements over regional issues like Afghanistan.   The Soviets rejected Shultz's proposal for a freeze in supply ofmilitary aid to the Afghan government during a withdrawal of theSoviet Union's 115,000 troops and for three months afterward. TheUnited States would stop aiding the Afghan resistance during thesame period.   Shevardnadze adamantly rejected the offer, telling reporters theSoviet backing for the Afghan government was codified in a treatyand ``we are not going to rescind that treaty.''   The Soviet Union has pledged to withdraw the troops, which wentinto Afghanistan in December 1979, but lack of agreement on aidcutoffs has complicated the process.   Shultz said the Soviets were willing to withdraw forces by theend of the year, beginning with a 50 percent pullout during thefirst three months. But unless the Soviets stop aiding the Marxistgovernment at the same time as it withdraws, Afghanistan willremain unstable, he said.   The two foreign ministers also apparently hit a dead end intalks about Central America.   The United States wants the Soviet Union to stop supplyingweapons to Nicaragua, but Shevardnadze wants the United States tostop doing the same for other Central American nations before theSoviets will stop helping Nicaragua, Shultz said.</TEXT></DOC>
