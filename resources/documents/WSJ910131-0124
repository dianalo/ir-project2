And surely he was right.   Almost everyone I know would like to see Saddam Husseindead, though most people use euphemisms like &quot;gone&quot; or &quot;outof the way&quot; or the like. I suspect almost everyone you knowwould like that, too. I suspect almost everyone in theadministration would like it, and I especially suspect thatGeorge Bush would like it, although he can't-yet-quite saythat.</LP><TEXT>   Yet it is against American law for this country to aid --with men, money or machines -- anyone in an assassinationattempt on a foreign leader. It has been that way since themid-1970s, when Congress and President Ford found out thatthe CIA had been going around trying to poison or shoot orgarrote or burke a passel of tinhorn dictators along withsome truly evil men.   But it's quite legal and proper to declare war in order tokill a dictator. Indeed, it stirs the patriotism in all ofus.   So this is the situation:   It's wrong to pay some mercenary or ideologue or patriot$10 million or $100 million or a billion dollars to sneakinto Baghdad and kill Saddam. It's wrong to do that eventhough Saddam has invaded Kuwait and tortured its people,even though he is a despicable despot, even though he is amenace to the world.   But it's not wrong to declare war to kill him. It's notwrong to spend scores of billions of dollars, to sendhundreds of thousands of young Americans off to a desert, tokill perhaps thousands of those Americans and probably lotsmore innocent Iraqis and Kuwaitis, to mess up this wholenation and imperil the whole world -- it's not wrong to doall that to kill Saddam Hussein as long as it's done in thename of war.   I just don't get it. If it's the policy of this governmentand, indeed, of most sane nations, to &quot;remove&quot; SaddamHussein, why do we have to do it the hard way? Why do we haveto kill so many of our own sons and daughters first? Why dowe have to kill so many other people? There's a lot ofmadness going around these days, and some of it is right hereat home.   ---   Another thing:   It's understandable if you missed it -- what with the war,the economy, the Russian upheaval and all -- but the mostincredible non-war story of last week was a three-paragraphitem on an inside page of The New York Times.   This is it:                                                                                                          Editors' Note   An article last Thursday about the strike at The DailyNews reported a threat by the paper to close or seek a buyerunless it could stem heavy losses. The article also reportedan assertion by an official of the Tribune Company, TheNews's parent, &quot;speaking on condition of anonymity,&quot; that thepaper and one union had been close to an important agreementon staff size until the company's board, in Chicago, &quot;shot itdown&quot; as an unacceptable compromise of management rights.   When the article appeared, The News's publisher, JamesHoge, called the account &quot;a total fabrication.&quot; His denialwas given equal prominence in The Times last Friday.   The Times has now learned that the report of the Tribuneboard meeting came from an anonymous caller who over a periodof weeks had represented himself as a Tribune official eagerto assist the reporter. The reporter never learned theidentity of his telephone source, and by quoting him violatedThe Times's standards of checking and accuracy.                                                                                                          I'm told the reporter still works at The Times. Why? Ifthe newspaper can't fire him for an ethical breach surelythey can fire him for being stupid.   Over the years in this column, I've been trying to warnyou that you can't believe what you read if what you read isfrom anonymous people. Anonymous people lie and cheat andpropagandize and never have to face up to it. They hidebehind their anonymity, launching everything from trialballoons to false but fatal allegations. They toy with thetruth, cuff facts, play with fates.   But, at least, I always thought the reporter knew who hewas talking to. The reporter, at least, could be heldaccountable even if the source couldn't be. But now we have areporter for The Times, of all newspapers, talking to somedoofus on the phone and printing everything without evenknowing who was calling. I don't think that even the NationalEnquirer does that.   Doesn't the Times have any editors? Where were they?   They were all busy writing editors' notes, that's where.For the very next day, this appeared:                                                                                                          Editors' Note   A television-page article on Tuesday about cutbacks in thenetworks' live coverage of the Persian Gulf war quoted anexecutive, &quot;speaking on the condition of anonymity,&quot; whoaccused CNN of &quot;getting a lot of things wrong.&quot;   In fairness, criticism should not have taken the form ofan unattributed quotation. And the organization beingcriticized should have received an opportunity to respond.   When asked for comment, Ed Turner, executive vicepresident of CNN, said the criticism was inaccurate andadded, &quot;It goes with the territory of being ahead on astory.&quot;                                                                                                          The editors of the New York Times wouldn't have to spendso much time writing notes if they spent more time editingcopy.   Or, if the editors like to write notes, why don't theywrite a note putting into effect a policy banning quotes fromanonymous people? That doesn't seem unreasonable at all. USATODAY bans them. The Courier-Journal in Louisville bans them.The policy would make Times stories more believable, moreaccurate -- and shorter. I don't see anything wrong with anyof that.   ---   This is the last Viewpoint column in The Wall StreetJournal, whose editors want to try something new. They'vebeen nice to let me share this space the last three years,and I thank them.   I thank you, too, for reading and writing. I hope you'vebeen listening. If you haven't, here's three years' worth ofmessages: Don't smoke; smoking kills. Ban guns; guns kill.Cherish the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Be leery andwary of the press, but defend it. Let young people and adwriters gain free speech, too. Fight secrecy, avoid war, getinvolved, love Iowa, take care of old people, and don't letyour children play football.   ---   Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Tribune inAmes, Iowa, and president of NBC News in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
