<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0094 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new method for field tuning in a H-resonator of an accelerating structurewith spatial-homogeneous quadrupole focusing is developed and experimentallytested. This method provides for a computerized processing of data ondependence of operating frequency of resonator and magnetic fields inits chambers on the piston position, and this processing results in determiningthe piston deepening values, under which magnetic field nonuniformitydoes not exceed the required values at the operating frequency. Magneticfield and frequency dependences on piston position were measured. Afterthat the values of required piston deepenings were determined using acomputer, for the required relative values of magnetic field and frequency.Calculation time using BESM-6 computer did not exceed 5 min. Capabilitiesof various groups of pistons during the resonator tuning were investigated.3 refs.; 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
