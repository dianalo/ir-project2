Although it is recognized that increased sulfur content,high temperatures, increased microbial activity and low pH all may serveto increase leaching of various components from coals, careful investigationof the relative importance of environmental chemical and biological factorsand the interaction between these factors have not been performed. Theyreport here the findings of several experiments conducted to establishthe relative influence of biotic and abiotic processes upon the leachatecomposition of several coals.</TEXT></DOC>
