<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0457 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention relates to an electric high-voltage bushing for an electricapparatus enclosed in a casing. The bushing comprises an elongated tubemade of insulating material and having a longitudinal axis. A conductorextending along said axis is surrounded by said tube and electricallyconnected to said apparatus. A flexible device constitutes a mechanicalconnection between tube and casing. A bushing according to the inventionis preferably designed for operating voltages in excess of 200 kV. Investigationshave shown that the machanical stresses, to which a transformer bushingof the above-mentioned type is subjected in case of earthquakes, areusually limited to acceptable values if the natural frequency of thebushing is about 1 Hz. A bushing, according to the invention, is constructedin such a way that its natural frequency lies preferably in the rangeof 0.6 to 1.5 Hz. The object of the invention is to design the bushingwith the flexibility that is required if its natural frequency shallbe in the vicinity of 1 Hz and at the same time, in case of earthquakes,be able to achieve such a limitation of oscillating and axial movementsof the bushing that these cannot lead to a detrimental mechanical stresson a terminal device located in the transformer tank, or on some windingpart connected thereto. 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
