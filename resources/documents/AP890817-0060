In the occupied West Bank, troops shot and killed a Palestinianescapee armed with an Uzi submachine gun after he defied an order tostop, the army said.   The shooting occurred Wednesday night near Idna, a village 20miles southwest of Jerusalem, the army said in a statement. The armyidentified the man as Shahadi Darwish, 25, of Beit Jala, and said heescaped from jail in May.   ``He was in detention on suspicion of committing severalterrorist acts, among these the murder of a local policeman in BeitJala in August 1987,'' the statement said.   The death raised to 537 the number of Palestinians killed byIsraeli troops and Jewish settlers since the Palestinian uprisingbegan in December 1987. Ninety-five suspected collaborators havebeen killed by fellow Arabs, and 38 Israelis also have died in theviolence.   Palestinian activists have called for a strike starting Friday toprotest the identification cards, which Israeli officials say areneeded to improve security.   The system was announced several months ago after a series ofslayings and other attacks against Israeli civilians by Palestinians.   The issue has become primarily a test of strength between thearmy-run civil administration in the Gaza Strip and clandestineuprising leaders, who are trying to sever ties between Palestiniansand Israel as part of their revolt against 22 years of occupation.   Brig. Gen. Arye Ramot, head of the military government in Gaza,told Israel radio today that 5,000 Gaza workers were allowed toenter Israel through the Erez Checkpoint between 3:30 a.m. and 7 a.m.   But Ramot said about 1,000 laborers in 300 cars were turned backwhen spot checks showed they lacked the new identification cards.   He said Israel initially estimated that 50,000 cards would beissued, but now believes demand could exceed 70,000.   Ramot said the cards would increase Israel's control over thepeople of Gaza, since their backgrounds could now be checked againstcomputer records. But he conceded someone who never committed acrime before could get the card, then carry out an attack in Israel.   Israeli officials said uprising leaders have confiscated as manyas 1,000 cards and intimidated workers who have tried to acquirethem.   Outside the complex of tents and stucco buildings where the cardsare issued, a 48-year-old Palestinian father of eight complained hehad to pay all his back taxes to get the new card and now expectedit to be taken away.   ``We get it and the popular committees come and take it, so it'suseless,'' said the man, who gave his name only as Yusef.   According to government figures, 110,000 Palestinians from theoccupied territories work in Israel _ 50,000 from the Gaza Strip and60,000 from the West Bank.   Many hold low-paying jobs in construction, textiles, restaurantsand city sanitation services. Together their wages amount to about$700 million a year.   Such work is the largest single source of income for Palestiniansin the occupied lands and constitutes a significant portion of the$1.3 billion gross domestic product of the territories.   The army earlier announced that effective Friday, no Gazanwithout a new identification card would be allowed to enter Israel.   Wall slogans in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday ordered workers toboycott their jobs in Israel for two weeks starting Friday.   Underground leaders of the uprising said in a leaflet thatworkers in the West Bank should strike for a week in solidarity withthe Gazans. The leaflet also said Palestinians who did not strikewould be considered ``betrayers.''   Israel radio said that many Palestinian workers defied strikes onTuesday and Wednesday and that some may stay in Israel to circumventnew strike calls and keep their jobs.   Many Israeli employers have begun trying to replace Arab workerswith Israelis, for security reasons and to ease Israel's risingunemployment.   The Central Bureau of Statistics said today that estimates forApril through June put unemployment at 9.5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
