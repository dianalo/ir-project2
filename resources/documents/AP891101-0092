News on gun deaths:   The U.S. government's National Center for Health Statistics putout a grim report the other day on the relationship betweenfirearms and young people.   It said that about 11 percent of all deaths of youngsters aged 1to 19 are gun-related.   Most at risk are black male teen-agers. More than 40 percent ofdeaths in that group during the period studied resulted fromshootings. The rate for white teen-agers was 16 percent.   Louis Sullivan, secretary of the federal Department of Healthand Human Services, said the statistics show that ``we are losingour youth, not only to disease, but increasingly to injury andviolence.''   Imagine, one out of 10 Americans who die under the age of 20 areshot to death, either accidentally or deliberately.   Yet the National Rifle Association continues to mouth itsmindless slogan: ``Guns don't kill people, people kill people.''Tell that to the parents of the approximately 3,400 youngsters whodie by the gun annually.   Sullivan said in a statement accompanying the report: ``Just aswe have controlled so many childhood diseases, we must now mount anequally aggressive campaign to rid our children's lives of thecauses and tools of injury and violence.'' Lawmakers would do wellto listen more to people like Sullivan and less to NRA officials,who resist all government control of firearms.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 30   Evening Express, Portland, Maine, on acid rain:   The world is getting used to surprising political initiatives bySoviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, even to the point of acceptinga back-seat role for the United States.   Well, he did it again during a visit to Finland last week. Amongother things, Gorbachev signed an agreement to reduce sulfurdioxide emissions from Soviet factories that are killing forests innorthern Finland.   Canada would appreciate that sort of gesture from George Bush.Sulfur dioxide is the main ingredient in acid rain. Eighty percentof the air pollution afflicting this part of North America isbelieved to come from coal-burning utilities and smelters in theMidwest.   Although this has been one of the principal concerns affectingU.S.-Canadian relations for years, the White House has yet to patchover the diplomatic damage inflicted by a Reagan administrationwhich largely refused even to admit the existence of a serious acidrain problem ...</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 28   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the Soviets andcapitalism:   Whether his goal is to change the Soviet system, or save it fromits various internal contradictions, Mikhail Gorbachev has beenasking a lot of American capitalists for advice these days, andthey are responding eagerly. From this dialogue has come, amongother things, a proposal to establish an American university inMoscow, one aim of which would be to help communists become _ ifnot capitalists, then some close relative. ...   A school to promote Western economic values can only help. ...Encouraging the spread of such enthusiasm _ from theintelligentsia, which has long distrusted Marxism, to thebureaucratic and managerial classes _ strikes us as a much betterway to encourage true reform than sending lots of cash to Moscow.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 25   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on President Bush's veto of abortionbill:   President Bush vetoed the massive Labor, Health and HumanServices spending bill _ blocking funding for AIDS research;children's immunizations against crippling diseases; and dozens ofother important health initiatives.   (He did it) because the bill contains a modest provision to payfor abortions for ... the most vulnerable of American women _ thosesuffering from the double brutality of poverty and rape or incest.   Mr. Bush threatens to veto the foreign aid spending bill if itreaches him with a Senate-passed amendment removing restrictions onfunding U.N. family planning programs. Those restrictions wereimposed under the Reagan administration at the behest of theright-to-lifers, who claimed that the U.N. money supported forcedabortion policies in China. The Senate bill requires the U.S.contribution be kept seperate from any funds spent in China _ (butthat's) not good enough for President Bush.   Becasue of this incredible policy, the United State has withheldbirth control information and supplies from Third World countries,where exploding populations make a mockery of all attempts toprovide food, shelter, education and jobs, and to protect theenvironment. The poorest and most vulnerable who suffer directly,but in this case all the world' people, in a few decades, will bepaying the price.   The president's abdication on these issues is a disgrace.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
