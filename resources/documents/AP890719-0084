Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, said today that a U.S. Coast Guardcutter was continuing to shadow at least two Taiwanese driftnetvessels about 1,000 miles north of Midway Island that were involvedin the attempted illegal sale of 500 metric tons of salmon.   Patrick Lee of Taipei, Taiwan, was arrested late Tuesday as hewalked out of the vault of a Seattle bank carrying suitcases filedwith more than $1 million in cash, Gorman said. Two associates ofLee also were arrested in Seattle, he said.   Gorman said that as Lee was arrested in Seattle, the fishingvessel Red Fin chartered by NOAA was rendezvousing with severalTaiwanese vessels in the North Pacific to complete the actualtransfer of the fish.   When the two captains boarded the Red Fin to arrange details ofthe transfer they were detained, but their two vessels fled when theCoast Guard cutter Morgenthau appeared on the scene, the spokesmansaid.   Congressional sources, who asked not to be identified, said theState Department had asked the government of Taiwan for permissionto board and inspect the two vessels.   Gorman said that Lee was being charged today in Seattle withviolations of the Lacey Act, which prohibits commerce in illegallycaught salmon or wildlife. The maximum penalty would be a five-yearprison sentence and $20,000 fine.   In addition, Gorman said the U.S. attorney in Seattle may fileadditional charges and a grand jury was expected to convene theretoday.   ``We think he is the kingpin,'' Gorman said of Lee, adding thatthe sting operation had taken six-months to pull off.   ``We've arrested people in the past in salmon-launderingoperations, but we have never had an undercover operation of thissize,'' said Gorman. ``Certainly this is the first time we have beeninvolved in a high-seas operation.''   He said that in addition to alleged violations of U.S. law,Taiwan prohibits the export of salmon.   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the sting operation beganearly this year when Lee contacted a member of the U.S. fishingindustry with an offer to sell salmon. The American company that Leeapproached than contacted agents of the National Marine FisheriesService.   Over the next six months, an agent poised as a buyer andcommunicated with Lee over ``monitored'' telephone and fax machinesto arrange the sale that climaxed in Tuesday's arrests, the senatorsaid.   ``This should put the lid on one of the biggest salmon-pirateoperations, and if the others have any brains, they'll sit up andtake notice too,'' said Murkowski.</TEXT></DOC>
