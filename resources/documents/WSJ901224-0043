In a sense theygot it, when the Reserve Board cut the discount rate to 61/2% from 7%. But the Fed probably still intends to proceedvery cautiously.   The Open Market Committee still isn't convinced inflationis dead, in spite of the relatively modest 0.3% rise in theconsumer price index for November.</LP><TEXT>   The committee members -- the seven Federal Reservegovernors and five of the 12 regional Fed bank presidents --often disagree among themselves on the proper course forpolicy. In the past two years, the inflation hawks haveseemed to hold the upper hand. Most committee members,however, think now that inflation worry should be balancedwith more concern for the economy.                                                                                                          It's a difficult balancing act, one that the Fed has notalways attempted. In the mid-1980s there was a sharp drop inbusiness activity; in the second quarter of 1986, theinflation-adjusted gross national product actually declined.The Federal Reserve responded by sharply stimulating theeconomy.                                                                                                          The federal funds rate that banks charge on overnightloans to one another had been above 8% in early 1986 but bylate that year was below 6%. The Fed influences this rate bybuying or selling securities in the market; thesetransactions increase or decrease reserves in the bankingsystem. By increasing banks' reserves, the Fed influencesthem to lend or invest. Banks don't like to let reserves lieidle, earning no interest.   Reserves climbed sharply in 1986. By early 1987, however,the Fed decided it might be overdoing the stimulus. Theconsumer price index, which had been flat in early 1986, wasrising sharply. So the Fed began, very gradually, tighteningup.   The stock market crash in October 1987 led the FederalReserve to ease policy for a few weeks but, by early 1988,the gradual tightening took over again. It has persistedrecently.   The decline in the funds rate since July, and otherinterest rate decreases in recent weeks, are deceptive. Theyreflect mainly a lack of demand for funds, not an aggressiveFed easing of policy. Since early 1988, as the chart shows,bank reserves have been essentially flat (see accompanyingchart -- WSJ Dec. 24, 1990).   When the Fed recently eliminated the reserve requirementson large certificates of deposit and Eurocurrencyliabilities, some analysts wrote that the Fed had given thebanking system $14 billion of reserves to back up increasedlending. Actually, the central bank scarcely had announcedthe change before it went into the market to start pullingout reserves; total reserves so far have stayed flat. At themost, the effect of the reserve change won't be as drastic asit might have been.   For a few weeks in August and September the Fed had seemedto realize that giving the banking system a modest additionto reserves might be compatible both with containinginflation and preventing a business collapse. In August andSeptember, bank reserves actually grew. In October, however,reserves dropped at an annual rate of 20.2%, and the dropcontinued in November.   So what will the Federal Reserve do now? The Fed last weekdecided to let its funds rate target fall to 7%, less of acut than some analysts had expected, but in line with thecentral bank's gradualist approach.   The cut in the discount rate, the fee the Fed charges onits loans to banks, isn't likely to have much economiceffect. Banks are reluctant to use the discount window unlessthey absolutely have to; discount borrowing is seen as a signa bank is in trouble. The central bank polices the discountwindow very carefully, and banks are reluctant to use itunless they have to.                                                                                                          Still the rate is widely interpreted as a strong signal ofFederal Reserve intentions. The cut was quickly followed by adrop in bond interest rates, but bond rates later moved up,reflecting continuing inflation fear. The Fed, if it is tospur business expansion, needs lower, not higher, long-termrates.                                                                                                          The Open Market Committee, as it met last week, had no wayof knowing how the Mideast crisis would play itself out. Thecontinuing upward pressure on energy prices keeps inflationfears alive. Meanwhile, the crisis is boosting the budgetdeficits, which by themselves used to cause inflation worry.A peaceful resolution of the crisis, of course, would givethe Fed room to be slightly more stimulative.   Indications are, however, that the committee recognizedthat controlling inflation didn't require the Fed to deny thebanks any increase in reserves at all. So, gradually, theFederal Reserve is likely to be moving in the direction ofease. Change won't be dramatic, but the next moves ininterest rates are likely to be downward.</TEXT></DOC>
