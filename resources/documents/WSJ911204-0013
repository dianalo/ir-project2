The computer giant is in talks with several big U.S.computer makers, including Hewlett-Packard Co. andInternational Business Machines Corp., about acquiring arival approach to some cutting-edge chip technology itcurrently gets from MIPS Computer Systems Inc., another ofthe ACE leaders, the executives said.</LP><TEXT>   While a change in chip technology wouldn't necessarilyeliminate Bull from ACE, which will use MIPS-designed chipsas an element of next-generation computers, analysts said acombination of the two approaches is unlikely.   A defection by Bull would highlight how the ACEcollaboration of some 200 computer companies has eroded sinceits splashy unveiling in New York in April. Analysts say thatwhile no consortium members have yet abandoned the group,they've neglected any pretense of a common strategy to pursuetheir own agendas.   However Bull is still exploring other options bycontinuing earlier discussions with Digital that could giveit another source of MIPS technology and thus salvage thefirm's ACE membership, according to the executives. Adecision could come before the end of the year, they added.   Declining to comment specifically on the talks or Bull'sfuture ACE plans, a Bull spokesman said only that bothcompanies still believe ACE offers the best technologyspecification currently available.</TEXT></DOC>
