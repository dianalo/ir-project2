The company disclosed in March that the SEC was going to act against the consumer and industrial products concern after investigating, among other things, corporate spending and executive compensation and benefits paid while Robert J. Buckley headed the company. Mr. Buckley was fired last year and Mr. Travers, who isn't a target of the SEC inquiry, succeeded him.    Though Mr. Travers wouldn't speculate about what the SEC might do, sources close to the company believe that the commission will likely require tighter spending controls rather than institute criminal proceedings or impose hefty fines. Once the SEC matter is resolved, several related shareholder suits against the company's board and some former and current executives are expected to be settled.    Mr. Travers wouldn't project a timetable as to when the company may be purchased, but he said its plan to shed businesses unrelated to its North American consumer products operations would be completed by year's end.    Allegheny has said that if an offer isn't made, it plans to continue as an independent company. But many shareholders would prefer a takeover.    A unit of First Boston, Sunter Acquisition Corp., (named after Allegheny's Sunbeam and Oster units) agreed in March to buy Allegheny for about $500 million. The offer was rebuffed by holders of Allegheny's preferred and preference shares. They refused to tender the two-thirds stipulated in the buyout agreement unless the price was increased.    &quot;First Boston decided it wasn't going to pay a nickel more,&quot; said Mr. Travers. First Boston has maintained contact with Allegheny but hasn't made any follow-up offer, he said. Under the First Boston proposal, holders would receive $24.60 for each common share, $20 for each $2.19 preference share and $87.50 for each $11.25 convertible preferred share.    The failure of the First Boston transaction leaves Allegheny in a tenuous position. Shareholders have become increasingly nervous about the lack of a follow-up proposal. Indeed, Allegheny's common stock in composite New York Stock Exchange trading had dropped by Friday to $16.375 from $20.75 when the buyout agreement was canceled in the first week of May. Its preference series had fallen to $16.125 from $18.875 while preferred stock dropped to $73 from $87.375.    Mr. Travers said he has received calls from shareholders asking whether another buyout was in the works.    Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher andamp; Singer Inc., said the lack of a subsequent offer is &quot;bothersome.&quot; He added, &quot;If they had other bidders, where are they?&quot;    Allegheny's 26 banks apparently were so sure the buyout would succeed that they allowed only 21 days to renegotiate an agreement should the buyout fail. Since then, Allegheny has been granted a 60-day extension on its existing banking agreement, which expires July 15. Mr. Travers said he has been meeting with banks for another extension, possibly to the end of the year. Allegheny's bank borrowings will be close to $200 million by June 30, Mr. Travers said, while overall debt will be in the &quot;range of $700 million.&quot;    Although Mr. Travers said banking relationships are more stable than they have been in years, some suppliers are nonetheless concerned. &quot;We've had suppliers call and say they hear we haven't got a bank loan and should they be shipping,&quot; he said. None of the suppliers have canceled contracts or demanded payment upon delivery, but some have shortened payment terms, he said.    Meanwhile, Allegheny continues to sell off its non-consumer products divisions. Between September and May, Allegheny sold about 12 units -- including its Wilkinson Sword group, which fetched $160 million -- for a total of about $400 million. Mr. Travers expects the remaining 12 to be sold by year's end. He wouldn't speculate as to how much the company would receive from the divestitures, but he said it would be less than $400 million. </TEXT></DOC>
