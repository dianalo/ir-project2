L. 100-590 (approvedNovember 3, 1988) which authorizes the issuance by SBA of trust certificatesrepresenting ownership of all or a fractional part of the SBA-guaranteedportions of financings made to State and local development companies underTitle V of the Small Business Investment Act, 15 U.S.C. 695, <T3>et seq</T3>., by amending 13 CFR 120.709. The amendment removes theexclusion of Title V (section 502) loans from eligibility for pool formationand requires that such trust certificates be separately issued.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>March 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>For further information contact Allan Mandel, AssistantDeputy Associate Administrator for Financial Assistance, Small BusinessAdministration, 1441 L Street NW., Room 804, Washington, DC 20416.

L. 100-590, the guaranteed portions of loans made pursuant to section7(a)(13) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(13), <T3>i.e.,</T3> Title V of the Small Business Investment Act, 15 U.S.C.695 <T3>et seq.</T3>) were excluded from the authority given to SBA to issuetrust certificates against pools of SBA-guaranteed loan portions [section5(g), 15 U.S.C. 634(g)]. The cited statutory amendment now extends suchpooling authority to pools formed with loans made under said Title V, whichincludes loans made pursuant to section 502 of that title, 15 U.S.C. 696.Accordingly, it became necessary to amend 13 CFR 120.709 to strike theparenthetical exclusion of Title V loans from pool eligibility, and replaceit with a clause authorizing separate trust certificates issued againstpools of loans guaranteed by SBA pursuant to section 502 of the Small BusinessInvestment Act.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), publication for public comment of the amendmenthere set forth is unnecessary for the following reasons:(1) The amendment does no more than implement without change a statutorilymandated authority; and(2) Immediate notification to the public of the new limit is essentialand in the public interest. Since no notice of proposed rulemaking is requiredby section 553, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required under theRegulatory Flexibility Act, specifically 5 U.S.C. 603.SBA certifies that this rule does not have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federal Assessment in accordance with Executive Order12612.For purposes of Executive Order 12291, SBA has determined that the ruleis not a major rule. The new pooling authority will neither increase nordecrease SBA's authorized loan volume; it will merely facilitate the saleof these guaranteed loans to investors. In this regard, we estimate thatthe pricing advantage will be less than $5 million annually. Therefore,the annual economic effect on the national economy will not exceed $100million. SBA is also certain that this rule will not cause an increasein costs for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or localgovernment agencies or geographic regions, or have adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-basedbusinesses to compete with foreign-based businesses in domestic or exportmarkets. There are no additional reporting or recordkeeping or other compliancerequirements inherent in this final rule which would be subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. There are no Federal ruleswhich duplicate, overlap or conflict with this final rule. There are noalternative means to accomplish the objectives of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 120</ITAG>Loan programs/business, Small business.Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in sections 5(b)(6) and5(g)(1) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 634(b)(6) and 634(g)(1)],SBA hereby amends Part 120, Chapter I, Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations,as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 120_BUSINESS LOAN POLICY</ITAG>1.
