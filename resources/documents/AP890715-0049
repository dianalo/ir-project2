Just over 40 years ago, the General Assembly of theUnited Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,which have been further developed and codified and are now embodiesdin the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic,Social and Cultural Rights.   We reaffirm our commitment to freedom, democratic principles andhuman rights. We reaffirm our belief in the rule of law whichrespects and protects without fear or favor the rights and libertiesof every citizen, and provides the setting in which the human spiritcan develop in freedom and diversity.   Human rights are a matter of legitimate international concern. Wecommit ourselves again to encouraging and promoting the universalrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.   Looking toward the future, we see opportunities as well asthreats; this impels us to pledge our firm commitment to upholdinternational standards of human rights and to confirm ourwillingness to reaffirm them and to develop them further.   We stress the protection of freedom of thought, conscience andreligion, and of freedom of opinion and expression; for withoutthese freedoms, other rights cannot be fully realized.   We stress also respect for the rule of law and the plurality ofopinion, for without them there can be neither representativegovernment nor democracy.   We believe equally in freedom of association in a pluralistsociety.   We hold that the right of each individual to physical integrityand dignity must be guaranteed. We abhor and condemn torture in allits forms.   We believe that all human beings must act toward each other in aspirit of fraternity.   We believe that everyone has a right to equality of opportunityas well as to own property, alone or in association with others.Extreme poverty and exclusion from society violate the dignity ofeveryone enduring them. Those who suffer or are in need should besupported.   We stress that the rights of the child, the disabled and theelderly require special protection.   We consider that developments in the human sciences, for instancethe progress achieved in genetics and organ transplantation, must beapplied in accordance with all human rights if the dignity of humanbeings is to be preserved.   We, the present generation, have an obligation to ensure thatfuture generations will inherit a healthy environment.   We reaffirm our belief that these rights and freedoms cannot beproperly safeguarded without the rule of law, impartial justice andgenuine democratic institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
