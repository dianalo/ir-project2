The satellites were launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base 140miles northwest of Los Angeles on Monday atop a 103-foot-high,liquid-fueled Titan 2. The Lompoc Record newspaper, quoting groundobservers, reported Tuesday that the Titan 2's expended first stageapparently blew up in a secondary explosion after separating fromthe booster's second stage. The rest of the booster was seencontinuing skyward.   A second source, also insisting on anonymity, told TheAssociated Press that the satellites were not endangered.   Neither source could confirm the secondary explosion, but saidthey wouldn't necessarily know of such an event if it didn't affectdeployment of the satellites.   ``I checked into it and everything I know is positive,'' saidCapt. Marty Hauser, an Air Force public affairs officer at thePentagon. ``It went well.''   The observers, who were very familiar with launch procedures,believed the crimson flash resulted from a puncture in a nearlyempty oxidizer tank on the the $37.5 million rocket's first stage,according to the Record.   The newspaper said similar anomalies happened after launches ofother rockets at Vandenberg without preventing their payloads fromreaching orbit.   Capt. Norma Payne, a Vandenberg spokeswoman, would not discusswhether an explosion occurred or whether the secret payload reachedproper orbit.   ``We're not going to comment on the results of a (classified)space flight,'' she said.   Space policy expert John Pike of the Federation of AmericanScientists has identified the Titan 2's payload as a White CloudNavy Ocean Surveillance System of four satellites which would beused to listen to the Soviet fleet's radar and radio communications.   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replaceaging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, Pike said.   The rocket was the first of a series of refurbished Titan 2intercontinental ballistic missiles to be used as a space booster.The missiles were originally deployed in silos in Arkansas, Kansasand Arizona in the 1960s, but were removed because of corrosion andother aging problems.   The Air Force decided to refurbish Titan 2 as space boostersbecause it was cheaper than building new rockets.   On Monday, Payne called the Titan 2 liftoff ``a spectacularlaunch with all systems operating as expected,'' but said officialswould not know for two to three days whether the payload achievedits intended polar orbit circling the Earth from North to Southpoles.   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for interceptingSoviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34Drocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. A source close to the project, whospoke on condition of anonymity, said the satellite failed toachieve its desired stationary orbit when the rocket's upper stagefailed to re-ignite. He said there was little hope of salvagingthat mission.</TEXT></DOC>
