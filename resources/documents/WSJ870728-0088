Koshland Jr., editor of Science, in the June 5 issue:    The intellectual excitement of rapid progress in some of the most vital problems in biology is, by itself, an enormous stimulus; but in each case practical applications are almost at hand. The prospect of an age of designer catalysts, of quick medical diagnosis of genetic defects, of new cereals for starving millions, and of brain therapy in neurological diseases is another spur to progress in these already rapidly advancing areas.    Biologists asked for a moratorium to assess risks in the initial days of recombinant DNA. How is it, now that the tools appear to be more powerful than was expected then, that there can be confidence that these experiments no longer threaten humankind? The answer has two parts. First, much is now known about the events that lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and about the safe application of recombinant DNA. Second, experiments have revealed that genetic engineering has been occurring in nature for eons without catastrophic consequences. Recombination in vivo results in events such as attachment of the hind end of one protein to the front end of another. Nature's genetic engineering through selection is much slower than modern laboratory manipulation, but it has been going on for billions of years. That fact can not only induce some humility in molecular biologists but also ease some fears of onlookers.    Ecological and moral dilemmas created by these new technologies are appreciable and will require new ideas. Tampering with the mind is generally considered to be bad, but should genetic engineering to alleviate Alzheimer's disease be outlawed? To feed starving populations is desirable, but if new crops help add a billion people to a crowded globe, is that necessarily good? The powerful new methods are here. Applying them may well require the use of brain enhancers.    ---   Pamela S. Falk, associate director of Columbia University's Institute of Latin American and Iberian Studies, in the summer issue of Foreign Affairs:    None of {Cuba's African} aid programs is likely to decrease in the short term. The white colonial exodus in Angola and in most of Africa drained the continent of many medical and technical personnel. Given the youthfulness of the continent's population, the impact of Cuba's heavily ideological literacy programs and public health training is far-reaching. Cuba's vice president summed up Cuba's role as a question of perspective: &quot;We see things differently,&quot; Carlos Rafael Rodriguez explained in an interview; &quot;America looks to win, and we look to the future.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
