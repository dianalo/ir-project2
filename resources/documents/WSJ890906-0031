Sykes </HL><DD> 09/06/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><TEXT>   As it opens its doors for the new academic year, Johns Hopkins University has no faculty member in its classics department who teaches Greek literature or philosophy; none who can lecture on Plato's &quot;Republic,&quot; Sophocles' &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; or Homer's &quot;Odyssey.&quot; But this is not just another Stanford-like setback for the Great Books.    In its small way, the fate of the classics at one of the nation's most lavishly funded universities casts a revealing light on both the fragility of the liberal arts and the mysteries of academic finance. Above all, however, it is a commentary on the paradoxical role of the federal government in the modern mega-university.    Johns Hopkins receives more federal research support than any other university in the country. In 1987, federal research and development grants totaled $476.3 million. In addition, the school has raised more than $512 million from private donors in the past five years. Even so, the administration revealed last year that the School of Arts and Sciences -- the liberal-arts core of the university -- had run up a deficit of $4 million and projected a shortfall of $7 million this year.    The financial crunch led to the resignation of Johns Hopkins's president (who earlier had been stripped of his budgetary authority) and the imposition of a draconian five-year financial plan that includes steep increases in tuition, a 10% cutback in liberal-arts faculty costs and the elimination of several academic programs.    As Prof. Jerrold Cooper, chairman of the Near Eastern studies department, remarked with a trace of academic understatement: &quot;When a university cuts its faculty after raising half a billion dollars, it's a very, very bad situation.&quot;    This might be written off as an aberration except for the distinctive role that Johns Hopkins has played as the prototypical American research university. With its emphasis on research and graduate education, Johns Hopkins did more to shape the new academic culture of the American university in the late 19th and early 20th centuries than did any other institution. Keeping up with Hopkins has been a national academic obsession since the day it opened in 1876.    In recent years, that hasn't been easy to do. Johns Hopkins has been one of higher education's most successful growth industries. Its operating budget increased from $88.5 million in 1972 to $557 million last year -- a healthy 529% increase. The largest single factor has been the increasing benevolence of Uncle Sam. In 1967, Hopkins ranked 15th among leading universities in its share of federal research money -- a respectable, if somewhat modest, showing. By the early 1980s, it had leaped into the top position.    This growth paralleled the increasing role of the federal government in American higher education in the years after World War II. While the federal government created vast new research centers, laboratories and federally endowed institutes, it also provided a case study in the law of unintended consequences, especially for the liberal arts. By shifting the focus of higher education from undergraduate to graduate education and from teaching to research, especially scientific research, the new federal money radically reshaped the priorities and prestige hierarchies of academia.    Then-Education Secretary William Bennett described the curious interplay of cash and scholarship: &quot;X dollars buys the student one professor; 2X dollars buys him two. But 3X and 4X and 5X dollars gradually remove the professor from the student, and 6X dollars may replace all the classroom professors with graduate students.&quot;    At Johns Hopkins the operation of Bennett's Law is writ large. The money was not going primarily for classroom teachers; nor was it going for the liberal arts. This is not altogether surprising given Johns Hopkins's historic focus on graduate research and the sciences. Unlike most large universities, Hopkins has a tiny undergraduate population -- only about 2,000 students. But the federal money grossly magnified those tendencies.    Of the $476.3 million the university received in federal research and development grants in 1987, the amount allocated to the School of Arts and Sciences was a mere 3.7%. Nor did the liberal arts fare much better in the university's extraordinarily successful capital campaign, where only 8% of the more than $512 million raised over five years will go for Arts and Sciences. In the absence of an institutional commitment to compensate for the imbalance, the liberal arts inevitably became the raggedy stepchildren of the university.    The situation was exacerbated by Johns Hopkins's policy of financial decentralization, under which each school was expected to go it alone. The result was that even as Johns Hopkins prospered and swelled, while the medical school built an $85 million research facility and the administration dreamed of a new space telescope, the School of Arts and Sciences withered like an etiolated limb. But the news is not all bad.    When the inevitable crunch came, Johns Hopkins adopted a plan to bail out Arts and Sciences and share revenue among the various schools. Hopkins's new administration is far more realistic about the limits of academic growth; it now recognizes that the university can no longer pursue every frontier of knowledge.    But the omens for the liberal arts are still troubling. On the heels of the cutbacks, two of the four professors in the tiny and beleaguered classics department quit; today the department has only a single tenured faculty member (Georg Luck, a Latin specialist) and must import guest lecturers for Greek literature. Other departments await the effects of attrition. Ironically, Johns Hopkins continues to have a relatively well-funded Humanities Center. But it too reflects the new academic culture. Prof. Luck calls it &quot;a fortress of trendiness,&quot; with a special emphasis on deconstructionism, post-structuralism and other forms of fashionable jargoned academic nihilism. The &quot;Iliad&quot; and Aeschylus may be out; but Hopkins has Derrida and de Man well covered.    Prof. Luck has watched the changing culture of the university. &quot;This was a fantastic place 20 years ago,&quot; he says. &quot;But it's become more commercialized. Hopkins has become more like a business.&quot; Not quite. Entrepreneurs don't have tenure.    Bureaucrats do. An eloquent tribute to the transfusion of the federal government's mindset into the universities is the fact that university administrative costs nationally have grown at twice the rate of instructional costs over the past decade. A notable legacy of the federalization of the universities has been the bureaucratization of the soul of higher education.    It's unclear whether the turmoil at Johns Hopkins, so often a trendsetter, is also a harbinger of more crises to come. Federal support for academic science and engineering nationwide topped $8.5 billion in 1987, up from less than $5 billion in 1980. Private money also continues to flow into the universities, usually in the form of restricted grants. As many as 60 universities and colleges are conducting fund drives with goals of more than $100 million each. Three schools are seeking $1 billion.    And yet, the signs of poverty amid plenty are becoming more widespread. Princeton and Cornell, no financial pikers themselves, are also wrestling with red ink. Mighty Stanford projects an $11 million budget deficit this school year, despite a $1.1 billion fund-raising campaign.    As Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago remarked in the late 1940s in a different context, lavishing more money on the modern university &quot;is a little like telling a drowning man that he can improve his position by drinking a good deal of water.&quot; The problem is not money, but values.    There is more than enough blame to go around: academic bureaucrats who imagine they are entrepreneurs; absentee trustees; professors in full-cry after consulting contracts; a society that has lost sight of the value of the humanities. But a special place in this rogues' gallery must be reserved for the jolly gnomes of official Washington, oblivious, as ever, to the consequences of their actions.    ---   Mr. Sykes is the author of &quot;ProfScam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education&quot; (Regnery Gateway, 1988). </TEXT></DOC>
