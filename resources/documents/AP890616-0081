Reagan, who was governor of California during anti-war protests,said the American Communist Party played a major role in ``thosestudent uprisings'' against the U.S. role in Vietnam.   The former president was interviewed from Paris on ABC-TV's``Good Morning America.''   Asked why he spoke favorably of the Chinese students but hadfrowned on the anti-war demonstrations in the United States duringthe 1960s, Reagan said:   ``The difference was, if you really look at what they were tryingto change, they were trying to bring about...the things that theyoung people in China are now trying to get rid of,'' Reagan said.   As governor, Reagan said he had access to police and otherintelligence unavailable to the public.   ``We knew the role that the American Communist Party was playingin those student uprisings,'' Reagan said. He said members of theparty were involved in both pro-war and anti-war demonstrations ``inorder to keep the disturbances going, to make sure that the troublecontinued.''   As for the Chinese demonstrators, Reagan said the students mighthave pushed their goals too fast but he believed they had widespreadsupport, especially among their parents and families. During anongoing crackdown against the students, the Chinese government hascharacterized them as counter-revolutionaries with little popularsupport.   ``You have to believe that those families sided with them,''Reagan said. ``So they didn't change any of those people's _ theChinese people's _ minds about the need for more freedom and moredemocracy in their system.''</TEXT></DOC>
