Also discussed are transport systems,alternate current and direct current, developments in the field of conductors,technologies, losses and economical aspects dependent on high voltagesand capacities of 500 MW and higher for distances of about 50 to 2500kilometers. Finally attention is paid to technological developments andprospects of the extraterrestrial solar energy conversion and transferto the earth by means of microwave energy (Solar Power Satellite, SPS).33 figs, 62 refs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
