Racist mentalities fit the bill in both motive and mode: theyare angry over recent defeats in court cases, and they have ahistorical bent for bombings, according to two hate group watchers.   ``There's no reason to disbelieve they would be connected tothese incidents. They have planned to kill federal judges before,and there have been similar incidents with bombs,'' said DannyLevitan, executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal inAtlanta.   On Saturday, a mail bomb killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals Judge Robert S. Vance, who wrested control of the AlabamaDemocratic Party from white supremacists during the 1960s, at hishome in a Birmingham, Ala., suburb. On Monday, another mail bombkilled Savannah, Ga., Alderman Robert Robinson, an attorney who wasworking on a long-running school desegregation case.   A fourth bomb was found Tuesday at the Jacksonville, Fla.,office of the National Association for the Advancement of ColoredPeople. The office was evacuated and the bomb, which arrived in themail Monday but was left unopened, was disarmed, officials said.   FBI Director William Sessions told a Washington news conferenceTuesday that the pattern didn't fit white supremacist groups, butsaid they weren't being ruled out. The FBI has warned civil rightsactivists as well as lawyers and judges to beware of strangepackages because of the possibility white supremacists mailed theSavannah bomb.   The bombs that killed Vance and Robinson were pipe bombscontaining nails, authorities said.   Racist groups typically use that sort of bomb, said LeonardZeskind, research director for the Center for Democratic Renewal.   ``The Klan and Nazi groups are more likely to use pipe or powderbombs,'' he said. ``Plastic (explosives) is drug stuff.''   Recent court losses have hurt racist groups in the pocketbookand in efforts to recruit more members, giving them a potentialmotive for retaliation, said Pat Carter of Klanwatch.   ``Some of these groups are perturbed that they are losing theirassets,'' she said. ``It has made their membership very bitter.''   In 1987, a U.S. District Court jury awarded $7 million to themother of a Mobile, Ala., teen-ager murdered in 1981 by two Ku KluxKlansmen. Last year, a U.S. District Court jury in Atlanta awarded$950,400 in damages to two civil rights leaders because of violencesurrounding the first of two civil rights marches in ForsythCounty, Ga., in 1987.   White supremacist groups have enjoyed renewed popularity in theSouth over the past decade. Incidents of racial hatred surged fromeight in 1978 to 276 in 1986, the last year for which figures wereavailable, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. JusticeDepartment's Community Relations Service.   The Center for Democratic Renewal, formerly the Anti-KlanNetwork, found 3,000 racial incidents reported between 1980 and1986, including about 500 in 1986 alone, Levitan said.   ``We view the level of hate crimes as having reached epidemicproportions,'' he said. ``Skinheads and youth are at the cuttingedge.''   Skinheads favor extremely short haircuts. Many, but not all,also embrace white supremacist ideology.   Klanwatch, a unit of the Southern Poverty Law Center inMontgomery, Ala., has identified at least 11 active hate groups inGeorgia and Alabama, including two Skinhead groups in Alabama andone in Georgia.</TEXT></DOC>
