The indictment charges that the Houston doctor, Nicholas Bachynsky, violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute with activities that included mail fraud, bankruptcy fraud and money laundering.    The grand jury also charged 20 other persons, including the doctor's wife and son, with a variety of counts. Dr. Bachynsky was held without bail pending a hearing tomorrow. His attorney, Michael Ramsey, of the firm Ramsey andamp; Tyson, said the doctor will plead not guilty but declined to comment further.    The more than year-long investigation, with the code name &quot;Stopdoc,&quot; and subsequent indictments were in part intended to signal a commitment to attack white-collar crime, law enforcement officials said.    &quot;This was a target case meant to show this was just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said Andrew Duffin, a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He cited insurance industry statistics alleging 5% to 10% of all insurance claims filed are fraudulent.    In some dozen cities, from Chicago to West Los Angeles to San Antonio, Texas, the indictment alleges, the defendants would file claims with customers' insurance companies for medical testing and diagnoses designed &quot;to disguise the true nature of the weight loss and smoking cessation programs from insurance companies by making it appear that the participant had sought treatment for medical conditions covered by insurance.&quot;    In some cases, the smoking and weight loss clinics would take extensive medical histories, according to the indictment, and &quot;these histories would become important at the time of billing insurance companies.&quot;    Clinic physicians were discouraged from submitting diagnoses of &quot;obesity&quot; or &quot;nicotine addiction&quot; on insurance claims and were encouraged to be &quot;inventive,&quot; the indictment alleges.    Almost no health insurance policies cover expenses for weight loss or quitting smoking, the indictment says. Nineteen insurance companies were victimized, it alleges. Law enforcement officials said the scheme involved tens of thousands of health insurance claims, though only 66 were part of the indictment.    In other charges, Dr. Bachynsky, who also owned a Houston antique store, had someone listed in the indictment only as &quot;Keith&quot; -- in reality an undercover FBI agent -- fake a burglary of the antique store so he could file a fraudulent insurance claim.    The doctor was also accused of intentionally sinking his own boat as well as faking the theft of a Mercedes Benz automobile to collect insurance proceeds.    Law enforcement officials said they seek Dr. Bachynsky's assets, which they think total at least $4 million. The government seeks numerous parcels of real estate and other assets owned by Dr. Bachynsky or companies that he controls, including, for instance, a 1985 Ford Bronco registered to one of the companies.    In addition to bank accounts, the indictment lists home furnishings from the Bachynsky residence, including a 17th-century bronze woman in chains, a ceiling fan, an alarm clock, a beige sofa, two silverplated candlestick holders, a gun case, a number of guns, two Moroccan rugs and facsimiles of two wild boars, an elk, two mountain rams and two ducks. </TEXT></DOC>
