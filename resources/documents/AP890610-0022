Police reported more than 1,000 arrests.   About 2,000 students fought riot police at two campuses in Seoulafter they were blocked from marching into the streets to denouncePresident Roh Tae-woo's government and the United States. Thirtystudent leaders were seized trying to reach the North Korean borderfor talks with communist officials, police said.   About 1,500 students fought police with iron pipes, clubs androcks at Yonsei University and about 500 students threw firebombsand rocks at police at nearby Sogang University. Police hurled rocksback at students but did not use tear gas.   ``Crush the Roh Tae-woo regime!'' and ``Yankee go home!''students yelled.   Hundreds of students later battled police in central Seoul,hurling rocks and bricks. Riot squads used tear gas to break up theprotesters and chased the students through the streets. Shoppers andpedestrians fled for cover.   Troops and students were injured in the fighting, but the policehad no figures on casualties.   More than 1,000 students were arrested in the clashes or as theytried to reach the universities to take part in a second day ofprotests, police said.   Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said20,000 riot police were deployed in Seoul to block the universitydemonstrations. About 6,000 troopers in green combat fatigues andvisored helmets ringed Yonsei and Sogang, outnumbering thedemonstrators.   The protests came after students staged rallies at the twocolleges to demand to take part in the 13th World Youth Festivalnext month in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. Radicalstudents are calling for unification with the communist North.   North Korea has invited South Korean students to attend the youthfestival, an athletic and cultural festival attended mainly bynon-aligned and communist nations. South Korea has accused the Northof attempting to incite domestic unrest to weaken the Seoulgovernment.   Student leaders charge that Roh and the United States keep theKorean peninsula divided. They have called for the overthrow of Rohand expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.   The two Koreas are bitter rivals. They have clashed frequentlyover the years. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start theKorean War.   Radical students and dissidents have been calling for the fall ofthe Roh government, but they lack support because of their extremeviews and violent tactics.</TEXT></DOC>
