A margarita, a little tennis, lots of fine cuisine. Sound dull? Then how about castrating cattle instead?    In the unending quest to take exotic vacations, travelers are venturing into strange territory. All types of adventure travel are booming. Vacationers who once settled for a couple of nice weeks at the beach are pushing for more challenging excursions, creating what travel agents call &quot;soft adventure.&quot; This might include such cream-puff outings as hiking in the Alps or riding elephants in Thailand.    True thrill-seekers, however, have been pushed a bit farther. Pat Dickerman, who heads Adventure Guides Inc., says a growing number of people want to spend their vacation on farms and ranches, participating in such novel activities as dehorning cows and giving them shots and pregnancy tests. Costs run up to $100 a day.    &quot;It's a real joke to pay that kind of money to work with cows,&quot; says Ms. Dickerman, who arranges the trips. &quot;But there's no way a rancher would take a greenhorn unless they pay.&quot;    Imagine the surprise of Janice Galletly. Working in marketing at the Pasadena, Calif., office of Trammell Crow, a real estate firm, she was one of the top performers in her region. The reward for her and others: a five-day cattle drive. &quot;I thought, 'Is this really a prize?' Maybe next year I should stay home from work,&quot; she says. Four of the lucky winners had never ridden a horse before.    She and 11 male colleagues got up at 5:30 each morning and drove cattle 30 miles. The last day was spent &quot;running around in the cold and rain with a cattle prod. We had to separate the boys from the girls, or the heifers from the whatevers.&quot; The vacation, she admits, is &quot;a hard one to top. I'm glad I did it -- once.&quot;    Her boss, Hayden Eaves, says he &quot;thought it would be fun to have some kind of special trip&quot; to build camaraderie. Mr. Eaves, a John Wayne fan, says, &quot;When you're faced with a bull that doesn't want to move, that's an exciting experience.&quot; He claims he returned home &quot;five pounds heavier from the things that stuck to me on that trip . . . we were standing above our ankles in mud and things cattle do.&quot;    For a less dusty trip, you might try snow camping. Peter Koedt, of Timberline Tours in Jackson Hole, Wyo., offers a nine-day, 60-mile cross-country ski trip. Nights get nippy -- to 30 below -- but he keeps travelers cozy by building igloos each night, stomping down snow and carving out blocks with a saw. He offers shorter trips, too. &quot;Most people think they're in a little better shape than they are,&quot; he says.    Yale Kroll, a New York dentist who has taken tours with Mr. Koedt, recalls on one outing, &quot;Peter said he could hear me breathing and wheezing when he was a half-mile ahead of me.&quot; He rose at six, skiied all day with a 55-pound pack, and helped build a new igloo each night. &quot;Someone who wants everything done for them shouldn't go,&quot; Dr. Kroll advises.    The first two days, Dr. Kroll collapsed into his sleeping bag and had to be awakened to eat. &quot;It wasn't until day three that I was able to stay awake long enough to have a conversation at night,&quot; he says. But the exhaustion, the altitude sickness, the week without bathing are minor inconveniences, he says, compared with having to go to bathroom at night in a blizzard. &quot;It takes several minutes to realize how cold it is,&quot; he says.    If that sounds too easy, Mountain Travel, of Albany, Calif., offers something a little more challenging: a two-month, 600-mile cross-country ski trek to the South Pole. You'll sleep in tents, dine on dried food and endure temperatures of 40 below, all for $69,500. The major problem, however, says tour operator Nadia La Bon, is likely to be &quot;putting up with length of trip.&quot;    (Sobek Expeditions, Angels Camp, Calif., offers the other extreme: Fly to North Pole in one day. You get out of the plane, look around for an hour, pop some champagne and go back. The vacation lasts a total of eight days and costs $7,500, but you have to get yourself to Canada, where you stay when you're not at the North Pole.)    What are the motivations of participants in these excursions? &quot;It's stress replacement therapy,&quot; says Dr. Kroll. &quot;I enjoy it more than vegging out on the beach.&quot;    He finds he comes back to work more refreshed after a strenuous vacation than a restful one. &quot;If I go to the beach, I spend four or five days mulling over (daily concerns), unless I have enough alcohol to dull out the brain cells. After four to six days of this (rock climbing or snow camping) I feel I've wiped the slate clean; it's like hitting the reset button,&quot; he says.    Mountain Travel, whose offerings include treks in Tibet or a month across the Sahara with camels, says business has grown 30% in the past five years. But Ms. La Bon says today people want quick thrills. &quot;Young professionals have money, but not time. We can't sell 40-day treks. They want to land at the base of Kilimanjaro, run up and run down, and get home,&quot; she says.    If you'd rather get some exercise than relax by the pool, reservations are being taken for October's &quot;Run the Roof of the World,&quot; a 13-mile race over the world's highest mountains. Participants take a two-week hike to the starting line, and helicopter rescues can be arranged.    The Himalayan jaunt, which costs $2,500 to $3,000, is &quot;a lot more challenging than an average marathon,&quot; says a spokesman for High Adventure Travel. At altitudes of 16,000 feet, &quot;it's hard enough to just walk and breathe.&quot; Last year, 48 runners ran a 26-mile marathon there. &quot;We found that for hard-core runners it was demanding, even too demanding. It beat a lot of people into the ground,&quot; he says.    If the psyche is more important than the physic, Red Rock Jeep Tours in Sedona, Ariz., offers &quot;Vortex tours&quot; to the &quot;major high energy spots&quot; in the area. Tour operator Mark Avery says Sedona is a mecca for New Age tourists, some of whom are taken in by insincere entrepreneurs who run them &quot;willy-nilly to the vortex&quot; to be healed or experience past lives.    By contrast, he says, &quot;One of the few legitimate psychics&quot; works with his company. Mr. Avery, who is not an Indian though he'd be &quot;proud to be one,&quot; teaches tourists about Indian traditions. &quot;We show people how to sprinkle blue corn meal on the ground, and say thank you to the earth before sitting down to meditate,&quot; he says.    Mr. Avery, who has &quot;been into metaphysics for 15 years,&quot; tries to discourage skeptics from taking the tours. &quot;I don't want someone who will dilute any one else's experience or disrupt the energy,&quot; he says. Which is probably just as well. He says, &quot;Chances are you won't find anything, if you're not tuned to metaphysics.&quot;    The Institute for Shamanistic Studies offers travelers a chance to spend July 17 to Aug. 1 in Katmandu with shamans who will teach them about the spirit world, healing ceremonies and mud dolls. Shamans, of course, are &quot;people who believe spirits affect human lives,&quot; and heal by going into a trance, says director Peter Skafte. He says shamans use mantras, which come to them in dreams or during a lunar eclipse, and drums to go into a trance. He recommends only those with &quot;a sincere and open mind&quot; take the trip, which costs $2,200, plus airfare.    Mr. Skafte, an anthropologist, can't guarantee a shaman can cure what ails you, but you'll at least get a consultation.    The Ashram in Calabasas, Calif., lets you get up at 6:30 a.m., hike four to six miles after breakfast, spend the afternoon lifting weights and doing calisthenics and hike a little more in the evening. A spokeswoman says this helps people &quot;wind down and de-stress.&quot; Breaks are provided for a little rest, herbal tea and vegetables. The fee for six fun-filled days is $1,700.    Or if you'd like to write off part of your holiday, consider spending your vacation documenting the foraging behavior of orangutans in central Borneo. Earthwatch Expeditions, Watertown, Mass., offers several tax-deductible trips that allow travelers to assist scientists. Other coming trips include a two-week dig for dinosaur bones in Switzerland and a chance to stay up nights protecting the eggs of leatherback turtles in St. Croix.    The cost of adventure travel keeps Clarence and Florence Richmond, of Walnut Creek, Calif., on the job. Mr. Richmond, 78 years old, works part-time and his wife, 79, works full-time. The pair have taken 13 packaged trips since 1969, including treks to Mount Everest, five weeks across India, and snow and ice climbing on volcanoes in Mexico. &quot;We're not millionaires. We have to work to pay for all those trips,&quot; says Mr. Richmond. He notes proudly that his wife climbed Kilimanjaro when she was 69.    Mr. Richmond says he'd rather go to out-of-the way places than more popular tourist spots. &quot;I don't give a darn about cities. I like to see the back country and the people.&quot; He says he likes to hike because &quot;you see a lot more when you walk . . . and, besides, we're not that old.&quot;    Sobek, which specializes in international river rafting, says customers are &quot;always looking for a bigger, faster, more dangerous river.&quot; But some hazards exist out of the water. Sobek had to abandon part of a river in Peru because of political terrorists. The Amazon is a &quot;major highway&quot; for drug runners, and in Africa, the company has lost 15 rafts to hippopotamus punctures.    Some travelers discover a rough ride. Barbara Middleton, a buyer for Espirit de Corp, an apparel retailer, took a Sobek trip down the Zambezi River in Africa, riding rapids with 10-foot vertical drops. Her third day on the river, she became violently ill. She was up all night in a tent; the next morning, she plopped into the raft, feeling nauseated and trying to sleep as she bounced over rapids. &quot;I thought, 'This is it. I'm in Africa, I'm going to die, I'll never see the U.S. again,'&quot; she says. The temperature hovered around 95 degrees and &quot;you can't go into water because of the crocodiles.&quot; She felt weak and queasy and was on medication for 30 days after returning home.    But she has fond memories. &quot;It was a very special trip,&quot; Ms. Middleton says. &quot;You get really close and develop camaraderie. The last day, we went through hippos. When it was over, it was so sad.&quot;    Her reaction? &quot;I'd do it again in a minute. It was so exhilarating, so challenging, so fun. Now I'm spoiled. What am I going to do this year? Go home to Indiana?&quot;    ---   Ms. Dolan is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's San Francisco bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
