In arrival statements, Subroto indicated that he saw a solutiononly through a revamped production policy for the entire 13-memberOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Subroto's talks in Iran and Iraq this week reportedly focused onthe question of whether Iraq should be allowed to increase its oilproduction quota to parity with Iran.   The Kuwait News Agency quoted him as saying it was ``necessarythat OPEC member states look into this problem (Iraq and Iranoutput) within the framework of the basic issue from which OPECsuffers ... overproduction by OPEC member states beyond the 15.06million barrels daily ceiling.''   Iraq has refused to adhere to its quota of 1.54 million barrelsa day, demanding parity with Iran's 2.369 million. Iraq'sunrestrained current output is estimated at 2.8 million barrels aday.   KUNA said Subroto indicated the Iraq-Iran production controversy``cannot be solved separately from the rest of the pending issuesrelated to OPEC production.''   Among the issues Subroto is discussing during his current tourof Persian Gulf nations is the production level of the United ArabEmirates, which he visited on an earlier tour and which currentlyis estimated to be producing at least twice its allotted quota. TheU.A.E. announced its quota should be 1.5 million barrels a dayinstead of its alloted 948,000.   Since late 1986, the cartel has slashed its aggregate output bymore than 3 million barrels per day to try to stabilize nosedivingprices around an $18-a-barrel benchmark.   But quota violations by member states has made the target priceelusive. OPEC's current output is about 20 million barrels althoughthe official overall ceiling set by the cartel is 15.06 million,excluding Iraq.   In Kuwait last week on his way to Tehran and Baghdad, Subrotosaid he believed it was reasonable that Iraq and Iran should haveequal quotas of 2.3 million barrels a day.   His statements to KUNA here confirmed he had made no headway sofar. But he was quoted as saying ``we have not yet despaired and westill have a number of proposals in this connection.''   Subroto said he discussed with Iraqi and Iranian officials ``thefuture level of output for each of Iraq and Iran,'' KUNA reported.He could not predict when a settlement was possible and said asingle visit to each capital ``is difficult for reaching asolution.''   In Baghdad earlier in the day, Subroto declined to comment toreporters on the result of his talks there. Iraqi officialsdescribed the talks as ``satisfactory.''   The official Iraqi News Agency said only that Iraq's oilminister, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, and Subroto discussedrecent developments in the oil market.</TEXT></DOC>
