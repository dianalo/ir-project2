The German maker of electrical and electronic goods didn't provide results for the fiscal third quarter, but a comparison with six-month results showed that group profit declined 18%, to 285 million marks from 347 million marks. Sales fell 2.6%, to 11.2 billion marks from 11.5 billion marks.    In reporting the lower nine-month earnings, Siemens cited high costs for investment and research and development, as well as increased competition resulting from the weaker dollar and slow world-wide economic growth. Siemens said nine-month sales were boosted by the accounting for a large power station during the first months of the fiscal year, but it added that even without that sales boost, revenue would have increased 4%.    Analysts said they weren't surprised by the profit decline. Siemens's managing board chairman, Karlheinz Kaske, had said earlier this month that profit in the full fiscal year would fall below fiscal 1986's 1.47 billion marks. </TEXT></DOC>
