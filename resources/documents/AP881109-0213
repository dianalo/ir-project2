Dunn Jr.   MINNESOTA (10): Dukakis won 54 percent, doing substantiallybetter thans 88,788,626, but more than 600 precincts were yet to reportfinalfigures. The Census Bureau estimated there were about 182,628,000Americans eligible to vote.   When the final figures are in, Gans expects the voter turnout tobe ``right around 50 percent,'' the lowest percentage of eligiblevoters to cast ballots since the 48 percent to 49 percent total in1924.   ``The turnout is down in every state of the union and theDistrict of Columbia, with the exception of Nevada and NewHampshire,'' Gans said. ``It's conceivable that by the time finaltotals are in that Nebraska and Colorado may be up. But if they areup, they are up marginally.''   Gans said the turnout in 1948 was 51.1 percent and there was asteady decline thereafter until 1980 when 52.6 percent of theeligible electorate cast ballots. In 1984, the number was 53.1percent.   The 1988 race ``was a horrible election in a variety of ways,''Gans said, ``and the people responded accordingly.''   The low turnout was caused by a variety of factors, but theprimary reason was the conduct of the candidates, the coverage ofthe campaign and the use of television advertising, he said.   ``One candidate refused to say anything about anything butcompetence and good jobs for good wages, and then refused to defendthe core values of his party,'' Gans said. ``The other candidatenominated Dan Quayle and then engaged in fairly low forms ofdemagogy without offering reasons for people to vote.''   He blamed political and television consultants who ran thecampaigns and reduced the flow of information to ``seven-secondsound bites'' and to television commercials ``substituting fordebate.''   ``The conduct of our campaigns has increasingly been put in thehands of irresponsible political consultants,'' he said.   Gans faulted the media for ``making polling a driving force inthe campaign'' and then ``writing off whole regions of the countryfor one candidate.'' This, he said, discouraged vast numbers ofvoters from going to the ballot box.   He also criticized television networks for projecting theeventual winner before polls close on the West Coast.   ``Right now the West Coast states have by far and away the lowestturnout,'' but final figures were not in, said Gans.</TEXT></DOC>
