North's case ``mischaracterizesbasic constitutional principles.''   In an unusual move, the department sought court permission tofile a brief in North's case to ``articulate, clearly anddefinitively the executive's view'' of the relationship between thepresident and the Congress.   The department said a brief filed last month by independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh ``contains numerous statements that areinconsistent with previously articulated statements of the law bythe Department of Justice and other Executive Branch agencies anddepartments.''   Walsh's brief in support of charges that North and threeco-defendants conspired to defraud the government by divertingU.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contras``mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles of separation ofpowers and executive branch authority,'' the Justice Department said.   The filing was made by Assistant Attorneys General Edward S.G.Dennis Jr., head of the criminal division, and Douglas W. Kmiec, ofthe office of legal counsel.   Department officials refused to specify the legal disagreementswith Walsh.   But the filing referred to a pleading in which Walsh discussedthe workings of the Boland Amendment, a series of restrictions onmilitary aid to the Contras that were enacted by Congress.   Walsh's brief disputed North's position that the Boland Amendmentdidn't apply to the National Security Council, where the formerpresidential aide had worked before he was fired two years ago.   A 1985 memo by Bretton Sciaroni, the counsel to PresidentReagan's Intelligence Oversight Board, said the Boland Amendment didnot apply to the NSC staff.   The Justice Department said it needs until Nov. 25 to file itslegal views, saying Walsh ``effectively precluded the Department ofJustice from advising the IC (independent counsel), prior to thefiling of its memorandum, of the department's views with respect toseparation of powers and executive authority.''   The filing drew a tart response from Walsh's office, which issueda statement saying: ``The independent counsel rejects the suggestionthat it should have solicited the views of the Department of Justiceor that it has mischaracterized the law.   ``While the independent counsel does not object to the submissionof legal views by the department, it strenuously opposes this whollyunjustified 11th-hour motion for an extension of time,'' thestatement said.   The Justice Department said it ``does not seek to support eitherthe motions filed by the defendant'' or Walsh's ``efforts to defeatthose motions.''   ``Accordingly, the department does not intend to argue for oragainst dismissal of Count One of the indictment.''   The department said it decided Wednesday to make the filing afterconsulting the White House, the National Security Council, the Stateand Defense departments and the CIA.   The filing came hours after Gesell had rebuked North in anopinion, saying his argument to dismiss charges he lied ``reveals askewed attitude toward our form of constitutional government.''   Gesell had denied defense motions to dismiss charges that theformer National Security Council aide obstructed Reagan's November1986 inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair by destroying documents andlying to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   North ``fails to appreciate the gravity of his alleged conduct,''Gesell wrote in a scathing opinion that denounced the retired Marinelieutenant colonel's contention that no laws were broken when helied to Meese and destroyed documents.   The judge rejected defense arguments that North cannot beprosecuted for lying to Meese because the attorney general'squestioning was not part of a ``pending proceeding'' before agovernment agency.   North is charged with lying when, among other things, he deniedto Meese any National Security Council involvement in divertingarms-sale proceeds to the Contras.   Gesell dismissed North's contention ``that he had an absoluteright to lie, to obstruct such inquiries, and to remove or destroyofficial NSC records because he had not been warned that if he didso he might be indicted.''   ``There is nothing in the Constitution, federal statutes, orapplicable decisions which warrants this cynical approach,'' he said.   The judge also rejected North's suggestion that he cannot beprosecuted ``because he was not put on notice that criminal statuteslong in effect would be applied to him if he acted corruptly asalleged.''   Walsh ``will need only to prove at trial that the specificquestions posed to North by the attorney general were precise andmaterial to this legitimate presidential inquiry'' and that Northpurposely lied, the judge said.   North is charged with conspiring with former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retiredAir Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to illegally divert U.S.-Iranarms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   No date has been set for any of the four trials ordered by Gesellfor each defendant.</TEXT></DOC>
