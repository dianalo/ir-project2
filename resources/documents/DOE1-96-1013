The Security Analyzer program can search through a facilityto find all possible surreptitious entry paths that meet various user-selectedtime and detection probability criteria. The program can also respondto user-formulated queries concerning the database information. The intelligentdatabase approach allows the program to perform a more comprehensivepath search than other programs that only find a single ``optimal'' path.The program also is more flexible in that the database, once constructed,can be interrogated and used for purposes independent of the searchingfunction.</TEXT></DOC>
