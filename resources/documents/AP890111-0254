On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gasoline prices shot up asmuch as 0.79 cent a gallon before midday pulling crude prices upwith them. The February contract for crude oil was up 18 cents at$17.87 a barrel.   Analysts said the stronger prices partially reflected investorconcern that the disruption in Mexican refinery operations couldmean lower U.S. supplies. The striking workers are protesting thearrest of their union boss on gun-running charges.   ``The U.S. doesn't get that many oil imports from Mexico. Theconcern is that we might move production into Mexico,'' said AndrewLebow, senior broker and analyst for E.D.andamp;F. Man InternationalFutures Inc.   Today's rise in oil prices also resulted from Tuesday's AmericanPetroleum Institute report showing that crude oil inventoriesdeclined sharply last week, analysts said.   On Tuesday, the February contract for West Texas Intermediate,the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled 3 cents lower at$17.69 a barrel after having been down as much as 25 cents duringthe session. On Monday, the February contract closed 17 cents higherat $17.72 a barrel.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, domestic heatingoil futures ended mixed, with the February contract settling at53.86 cents a gallon, down 0.29 cent.   Unleaded gasoline futures also closed mixed, with the Februarycontract down 0.05 cent at 47.91 cents a gallon.   Analysts said prices were dragged down by profit-taking. Energyanalysts said investors decided to take advantage of steadily risingprices and began a round of heavy selling early in the day.   Prices later recovered most of their losses on reports thatnon-OPEC oil producing countries were preparing to announceproduction cutbacks to help bolster the recent accord among membersof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institutereported that for the week ended Jan. 6, crude oil stocks fell by5.5 million barrels, to 328.86 million barrels. Gasoline suppliesincreased by 531,000 barrels to 229.1 million and heating oil stockswere up 726,000 to 127.5 million barrels.   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investments atPrudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the API report would probablysend crude futures higher.   ``Many people were expecting a buildup of as high as 7 millionbarrels of crude so the API report will be construed to be verypositive for the market,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
