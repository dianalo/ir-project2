Hanson complained of chest pains last April. Dr. Richard Boggssaid Hanson came to his Glendale, Calif., office, then collapsed anddied of a heart attack. Hanson's business partner, John Hawkins, hadthe body cremated.   It wasn't the perfect crime, but it came ``extraordinarilyclose,'' Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Al MacKenzie said Feb.6 outside the courtroom where Boggs denied charges of murder,conspiracy, theft, insurance fraud and assault with a stun gun.Boggs, held without bail, faces the death penalty.   ``If a couple of things hadn't gone our way, it could really havebeen perfect,'' Columbus police Detective James Lanfear saidrecently.   Hanson and Hawkins, partners in the Columbus-based Just Sweatsathletic wear chain, face the same charges in what authorities saywas a plot to fake Hanson's death and collect on $1.5 million inlife insurance while making off with up to $2 million embezzled fromtheir company.   ``You're talking some real serious planning here,'' said Lanfear.   Hanson, 47, was arrested Jan. 29 at Dallas-Fort WorthInternational Airport, carrying $14,000 in cash and 14 ID cards _including one for the alias he allegedly assumed in Miami after his``death'' _ and the driver's license of Ellis Henry Greene, the manwho actually died in Boggs' office.   Hawkins, 25, remains at large, with $1 million in insurance moneyand $200,000 from company accounts, but without $500,000 from twoother policies. ``He's lived off the streets since he was 17. He'sbeen around. He knows how to hide,'' said Lanfear, who would havepreferred to catch Hawkins first. ``He's younger and I think hewould have talked. I'm afraid Hanson won't talk.''   The scheme, according to authorities and court records, went likethis:   Beginning in May 1987, Hanson bought $1.5 million in lifeinsurance policies from Farmers New World Life Insurance Co. ofMercer Island, Wash., naming Hawkins as beneficiary. He signed awill leaving everything to Hawkins, and directing that his body becremated and no relatives notified of his death.   In January 1988, Hanson rented a Miami condominium using analias. The next month he consulted a plastic surgeon about changinghis appearance, told some friends and co-workers about chest pains _and some that he had AIDS _ then left for California, where he oncehad lived.   Hanson stripped Just Sweats accounts of as much as $1.8 millionbefore he left April 15 for Los Angeles. That left the company thepair founded in 1985 with assets of $1.4 million and liabilities of$2.3 million; it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors inAugust.   ``I guess I can say I'm disappointed in them,'' said MelissaMantz, the Just Sweats vice president who took control of the $8.5million-a-year company after Hawkins gave her power of attorney inan apologetic letter saying the ``pressures of running the businesshave totally driven me almost crazy.''   ``I don't think you could print what I feel deep down,'' Mantzsaid.   On April 16, Hanson and Boggs killed Greene, 32, a drifter whoonce lived in Ohio. The method was unusual, MacKenzie said,declining to be more specific until a preliminary hearing scheduledfor Feb. 21.   Boggs called police April 16 and said Hanson had collapsed anddied in his office after complaining of chest pains. Glendale policedid not question the identity and marked the case closed. The deathwas listed as natural.   Hanson left Los Angeles the same day, using the name Wolfgang vonSnowden, and Hawkins flew to Los Angeles to claim the body. Hawkinscollected $1 million from the insurance company July 8 and leftColumbus about a week later after parking his car at an airport lotwith the keys in the ignition.   The night before, roommate Erik DeSando told The Wall StreetJournal, Hawkins ``spilled his guts,'' blurting out that Hansonwasn't dead and that his disappearance was insurance fraud. Lawenforcement officials believe the pair used an insurance scaminvolving a staged robbery of furniture and paintings they wererenting to bankroll Just Sweats, the Journal said.   ``John was always thinking up scams,'' DeSando said.   Hanson underwent cosmetic surgery a month after the killing, andbegan using the name and identification of Greene, as well as thevon Snowden alias. Hawkins went to Colorado, where he used the nameJerry Anthony Greene.   Vincent Volpi, a Columbus private investigator hired by FarmersNew World Life, turned up a von Snowden connection after he took twobags of garbage from the curb in front of a Columbus condominiumHawkins shared with DeSando.   ``It's a procedure that we use a lot more than I'd like to thinkabout, but it's very successful. People throw out a lot of evidencewith the trash,'' said Volpi, who found December 1987 telephonebills showing a call to Miami.   He learned that the Florida condo was being rented by a man whocalled himself Wolfgang E. von Snowden. DeSando remembered seeing anote written by Hawkins that said: ``Distance myself from Wolfgang.''   Von Snowden named Hawkins as an emergency contact and a referenceon his rental application for the condo, gave as a previous addressHanson's Columbus apartment, the California driver's license numberhe gave was Hanson's expired license, and his listed employment wasas an inactive partner in Just Sweats, The Columbus Dispatchreported, citing leasing records.   A few weeks after the death in Boggs' office, at the request ofFarmers New World Life, police obtained a copy of Hanson'sCalifornia driver's license and compared it with a photo of the deadman. The license hadn't been on the body, but credit cards and abirth certificate had. The resemblance was strong, but the man'sthumbprint revealed him to be Greene.   The Los Angeles County coroner's office changed the officialcause of death to undetermined, and police began to investigate ahomicide.   Boggs ``was tricked and bamboozled by Hanson and Mr. Hawkins,''defense attorney Sammy Weiss said outside the neurologist'sarraignment. ``There's a tremendous resemblance between Mr. Hansonand Mr. Greene,'' Weiss said.   Boggs, 55, told the Journal that although he had seen Hanson forannual check-ups for seven years, he was ``not in the business ofascertaining identifications. ... I thought I was treating MelvinHanson.''   Nine months after he supposedly died, Hanson was nabbed as hereturned from Acapulco, Mexico, apparently to sell some property inSt. Petersburg, Fla. He was arraigned in Texas on theft charges andagreed not to fight being returned to Ohio, where he now is beingheld on $5 million bond.   Asked by the Texas judge if he could afford to post the bond, hereplied: ``If they let me die a few more times, I can.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs Feb. 15</NOTE></DOC>
