Espirito Luciano, a 19-year-old government soldier who stepped on a land mine and lost his left leg 18 months ago, is dumbfounded by the question. He scratches his head, laughs nervously, and asks his comrades at a hostel for casualties, all of them amputees, for help. No one speaks. &quot;Peace?&quot; he finally says. &quot;In Angola we do not know this word.&quot;    On the opposite end of this huge country, at the bush headquarters of the Angolan rebel movement known as Unita, Lt. Col. Paulo Gato is equally puzzled. As the man in charge of Unita's military instruction, he cannot conceive of life without war. &quot;Peace?&quot; he asks incredulously. &quot;I'll always be a soldier.&quot;    For Angolans, who have known nothing but war since 1961, peace is an abstraction as arcane as a foreign language. For 14 years they fought Portuguese colonialists in a bloody struggle that ended in 1975. Then, on the day of independence, a feud between rival liberation movements exploded into an international conflict. Cuban soldiers streamed into the country to bolster the Marxist ruling party and repel U.S.-supported rebels backed by invading South African forces. The guns of Angola haven't rested a day in 27 years.    As a result, one of the richest countries in Africa, blessed with oil and diamonds, is now one of the world's most impoverished. The capital of Luanda, once described as the Rio of Africa, is a filthy and smelly hovel of crumbling buildings and decaying morals. Angola is the orphan and amputee capital of the world.    Recent visits to both sides of the civil war reveal the most enduring and tragic legacy of three decades of nonstop fighting: profound and divisive hatred and an ingrained intolerance that has made confrontation a virtue and negotiation a vice. Brotherhood and compromise, like the word peace, seem to have disappeared from the Angolan vocabulary.    Even as the U.S. mediates talks to rid Angola of its foreign armies, true peace in this sad corner of Africa remains as distant as ever. Several thousand South African troops completed their withdrawal by the beginning of September, and last week Angolan, Cuban and South African negotiators continued to discuss a timetable for the withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban soldiers. In the meantime, the South Africans and Cubans have declared a cease-fire in their war. But not the Angolans. They don't know the meaning of cease-fire, either.    &quot;How long can the war go on?&quot; asks Desiderio da Costa, Angola's deputy minister of energy. &quot;We are patient people. We can wait for the happy days.&quot; In other words, the war will go on, and on.    Leaders on both sides of the civil war -- the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita -- speak softly at times, dreaming of happy days ahead. But they aren't willing to lay down their big sticks, at least not until the enemy is vanquished.    The MPLA talks about &quot;national harmonization.&quot; What this means is that South Africa's Unita &quot;puppets&quot; must surrender or perish. &quot;All those forces that oppose the party and the government will be defeated,&quot; says Gen. Pedro Maria Tonha, the MPLA's defense minister. The day Unita loses its U.S. and South African support, the MPLA believes, is the day Unita will be crushed.    Unita talks of &quot;national reconciliation. &quot;What this means is that it will keep fighting until the MPLA, ridiculed as Cuban surrogates, brings Unita into the government. &quot;The MPLA will talk to us,&quot; insists guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi in an interview at his bush-camp base, called Jamba, deep in Angola's southeastern corner. &quot;Otherwise we will resist.&quot; Unita believes that the day the last Cuban leaves Angola is the day it will smash the MPLA and march into Luanda. Even if U.S. and South African aid to Unita stops, Mr. Savimbi claims he has weapons and unspecified help from other &quot;friends&quot; that will sustain his guerrilla campaign for many years more.    Nowhere is there a defeatist note. &quot;No one believes they will lose,&quot; says Espirito, the boy soldier. &quot;We all expect to win.&quot;    In the middle of a busy traffic circle in Luanda, a curious monument to the war depicts two tanks running into each other. Across the street, a poster quotes the words of Agostinho Neto, the late MPLA leader and Angola's first president after independence: &quot;Every citizen must consider himself to be a soldier.&quot;    On the southern edge of the capital, in a building that served as a restaurant and hotel during colonial days, 486 soldiers wait for the day when they can be fitted with new legs. This is an amputee hostel for the wounded awaiting flights to East Germany, Hungary, Yugoslavia or Russia for treatment. For them the fighting may be over, but the war endures.    &quot;Look at all the suffering Unita has caused,&quot; says Espirito, resting his one leg on a bar stool. &quot;How can we stop fighting now?&quot;    His superior officer, Lt. Alfredo dos Santos, has just returned from East Germany, where his right foot was repaired. He interrupts with a diatribe against Unita. &quot;You say they are our brothers. What brother would do this to his brother?&quot;    As a group of foreign journalists leaves the hostel, the soldiers hop to attention on one leg and raise their fists in determination. &quot;Viva MPLA!&quot; they shout. &quot;Victory is certain!&quot;    Angola's foreign interlopers -- Cubans, South Africans, Americans and Soviets -- may believe that a military victory by one side or the other is impossible. But such thinking is considered heresy inside the country. In the central provinces of Huambo and Bie, still under MPLA control, emotions are particularly sharp, for this is where many of the Unita leaders were born.    Over breakfast in the ornate government palace of Huambo, Andre Olamba, the provincial director of culture, speaks disdainfully of the Unita &quot;traitors&quot; who he says attack and terrorize the peasants. He sheepishly admits that his brother-in-law joined Unita in 1975. &quot;But he's not from my side of the family,&quot; he adds quickly. &quot;We don't even know if he's dead.&quot; Nor does Mr. Olamba, picking at his fried chicken, seem to care.    Just outside the town of Kuito in Bie province, local officials and residents stand amid the rubble of the delivery room of a maternity clinic. They say it was destroyed in May by a Unita blast.    &quot;Bandits,&quot; says Clementio da Silva Angolares, the ideological commissar of the province, spitting out the MPLA's standard description of Unita. &quot;Their war has no objective. This is not a military unit. Babies are born here.&quot;    Peace is the last thing on his mind. &quot;We can never imagine a reconciliation with Unita,&quot; Mr. Angolares says to the delight of the citizenry crowding around him. &quot;How can we reconcile with these people? How can we?&quot; The best Unita can hope for, he says, is to accept the government's offer of clemency. &quot;Those who don't turn themselves over,&quot; he warns, &quot;are just awaiting death.&quot;    At Unita's headquarters at Jamba, the war takes on an eerie timelessness. &quot;The years, they just pass by,&quot; says Brigadier Ernesto Mulato, who was chased out of Angola by the Portuguese in 1960 only to return to the bush, and Unita, in 1975. &quot;We've been out here for 13 years, but for us it seems like yesterday.&quot;    Unita leaders, who began their guerrilla campaign against the Portuguese in 1966, say they didn't fight for independence so that Angola could be &quot;re-colonized&quot; by Cubans and Soviets. The guerrillas claim control of one-third of the Angolan countryside -- which they call &quot;Free Angola&quot; -- and they pledge to continue fighting until they can &quot;liberate&quot; the rest of it. If that takes another 13 years, so be it.    &quot;When there is a common suffering of your people, it is easier to bear,&quot; says Brig. Mulato. &quot;Our people are a determined people. Look at Gen. Savimbi. He's been fighting for 30 years, and every day he gets stronger and stronger.&quot;    That is seven years longer than Paulo, a short, sensitive lieutenant, has even been alive. Paulo was only 11 in 1976 when MPLA and Cuban forces swept into his town in Bie Province. He was at school the day his five sisters and parents were killed, and he managed to run away into the bush. A few days later, he was picked up by Unita forces. It wasn't long before the orphan became a soldier.    &quot;I want the Cubans and the MPLA to pay for what has happened to my family,&quot; Paulo says bitterly. &quot;When I first went into the bush, I cried a lot. Now I understand I wasn't crying alone. What has happened to me has happened to millions of Angolans.&quot;    Like David Oliveira. He, too, was separated from his family in 1976 when the fighting swept into Huambo Province, and he, too, &quot;cried like a baby&quot; during his first days in the bush. Today, he is 31 years old and a captain in Unita's special forces. He has six steel pins in one ankle, which was shattered by a bullet in 1978.    Reclining on a tree limb, scribbling into his diary of the war, Capt. Oliveira says, &quot;We are winning the war. I can tell you that for sure. We have the motivation.&quot;    He puts down his writing and saunters over to the billiards table sitting unevenly in the sand at Unita's visitor's camp. It is a jolting bit of civility in this land of war. &quot;How can people live for 13 years in the bush, behind trees, under trees?&quot; the captain asks. &quot;Thirteen years of fighting destroys people intellectually and physically. But you think of how all those people under Cuban control are living, and you don't get tired. You can't get tired.&quot;    He sinks a ball and continues his discourse. &quot;For Unita, it was hard to start fighting again in 1975 after fighting all those years for independence. But it isn't hard to continue fighting now,&quot; he says. He proudly announces that he has a one-year-old son. &quot;He will take up my gun when I die,&quot; the captain says. </TEXT></DOC>
