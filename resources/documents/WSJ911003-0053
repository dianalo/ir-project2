Earlier this year, Sun tried to strike a similar deal withApple. Although the talks were never disclosed, Sun cameclose to snagging Apple as a partner. But in the end, JohnSculley, Apple's chief executive officer, opted in favor of apartnership with IBM, Sun's chief rival.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We thought the Sun people were really good people,&quot; saidMr. Sculley in an interview. &quot;From a cultural standpoint,people could see the fit. But the reason we chose IBM (is),when you want to launch a new operating system, it helps tohave someone bring along the mainstream.&quot;   An Apple-Sun union isn't to be, but the possibility stillfascinates observers. There is an element of romance in thesemusings. Both Sun and Apple are classic Silicon Valleysuccess stories: billion-dollar companies created almostovernight by entrepreneurs. Apple, founded in 1977 by twocollege dropouts, pioneered personal computing; Sun, the 1981brainchild of two immigrant engineers, created a desktopcomputer for scientists and is today the fastest-growingmaker of computer workstations.   Sun and Apple generally don't compete for the samecustomers, so it was natural that the two considered teamingup. Sun's expertise in both microprocessors, or the &quot;brains&quot;inside a computer, and electronic networking appealed toApple executives. In July 1990, one Apple senior manager evenwrote an open memo extolling the virtues of Sun's technologyand advising that Apple either merge with Sun or forge atechnical partnership. The writer went on to criticizeApple's own engineering efforts as weak and ineffective.   The memo was forwarded to Mr. Sculley, who only monthsearlier had decided to supervise directly all of Apple'sproduct development. Mr. Sculley asked his top managers tostudy Apple's possible use of Sun's Sparc microprocessor. Inreturn, Apple would offer its distinctive software and anentre to the personal-computer market, which dwarfs Sun'sworkstation market in size.   Some kind of deal between Sun and Apple then seemedpossible, in part because of close ties between executives atboth companies. Joseph Graziano, Apple's chief financialofficer and an influential adviser to Mr. Sculley, held asimilar job at Sun in the late 1980s. Wayne Rosing, one ofSun's top engineering executives, once held a like post atApple. Many other executives also had worked at both Appleand Sun, whose headquarters are a short freeway ride apart inCupertino and Mountain View, Calif., respectively.   Apple and Sun had tried at least once before to strike adeal. In 1987, the two companies nearly concluded a merger.One participant said those talks finally snagged on thequestion of whether Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executiveofficer, would serve as president of the enlarged Apple -- amove Mr. Sculley couldn't stomach, say observers.   In the fall of 1990, the two companies again talked aboutmerging, but discarded the idea quickly, say executivesinvolved in the discussions, in favor of a partnershipagreement. For its part, Sun was eager to persuade Apple toadopt its Sparc microprocessor, which was the cornerstone ofits strategy to craft an industry computer standard. AndApple had begun actively searching for a partner to supplysuch an advanced chip as well as help to promote someadvanced Apple-designed software.   By the spring of 1991, Apple was still shopping for apartner, and Sun was still pitching its virtues. BetweenMarch and April, Mr. McNealy and Mr. Sculley met severaltimes.   About the same time, a team of Apple engineers voiced apreference for the Sparc chip over other advanced chips fromIBM, Motorola Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Mips ComputerSystems.   But as summer approached, negotiations between Apple andSun were losing steam. Mr. McNealy then learned that Appleand IBM were talking. He still hoped for a deal, but clearlyMr. Sculley was more turned on by the prospect of apartnership with Big Blue.   Although the IBM deal promises to boost Apple's laggingsales to big business, some observers are surprised by Mr.Sculley's preference. They suggest he feared that fast-growthSun might overwhelm Apple. And Mr. Sculley, they say, did notrelish working with Mr. McNealy, a brash 35-year-old whoprojects the opposite image of the cool, calculating Mr.Sculley.   &quot;The clashes of egos would have been too great for thisdeal to go through,&quot; says one of Mr. Sculley's associates.   Yet the discomfort of clashing personalities might havebeen worth it. The whole thrust of Apple's history has beento undermine the establishment's view of computers ascentrally controlled machines tailored to the needs of largeorganizations, rather than the individual. Similarly, Sun hastaken an upstart's mentality: Give customers vast computerpower for peanuts.   &quot;At times, both companies have seen themselves as beingagainst the dinosaurs,&quot; said Robert Herwick, an analyst atHambrecht andamp; Quist. &quot;Then Sculley . . . discovered the virtuesof dinosaurs.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
