The sponsor of the exemption, Rep. Philip Crane, explained that &quot;based upon performance we should not be contemplating such pay raises.&quot;    We certainly agree there's not much value-added from a Congress that hasn't passed a budget in years, but the House action also froze the salaries of more-deserving federal employees. The Crane provision did not say, &quot;Members of Congress are wastrels, so get no raise.&quot; Instead, it was written to deny the pay increase to federal employees at all levels who make $72,500 and above. This includes not just congressmen, but many senior executive-branch officials and all federal judges.    The big losers in the salary wars are always the judges. They hold lifelong positions, so never expect to go through the revolving door. Their own conflict-of-interest rules prevent them from almost any outside work except teaching. Yet congressmen have decided to make their salaries the same as federal district court judges, now $89,500. This means that whenever Members of Congress sense public outrage if they vote themselves any increase, the judges also suffer. The real value of judicial salaries has fallen by 30% in the past decade.    By contrast, you can bet that there are very few congressmen whose annual income bears any relation to their federal salary. Most of them rake in thousands of dollars in PAC fees, anachronistically called &quot;honorariums,&quot; for attending meetings, breakfasts and poolside get-togethers.    Congress also exempts itself from the Ethics in Government Act limits on what executive-branch officials can earn. This can have hilarious results, as when Elizabeth Dole was in the cabinet and traveled with her husband, and only Senator Dole's share could be paid by a PAC.    Readers may also recall what we described as the &quot;Congre$$ional $taff Whodunit,&quot; the episode of the mysteriously inserted provision to raise top staff salaries by some 20% that popped up in the last continuing resolution. This was discovered weeks after President Reagan signed the CR, and still no one has admitted authorship. The result is that some staffers are now paid the same as the four-star generals who manage the Pentagon's $285 billion budget.    Rep. Crane had an alternative plan for legislative-branch pay. He proposed putting congressmen to work on a commission basis. Under this scheme, the amount congressmen earn would vary inversely with the total amount of federal spending. This idea may need some time to percolate, but it sounds good to us.    In the meantime, the judiciary might take a lesson from Jim Wright, who has buttressed his Speaker's salary by more than $60,000 with his publishing venture. He's earned 55% royalties by pasting up old speeches into a book that lobbyists order by the thousands of copies. Perhaps federal judges should now collect excerpts of their favorite opinions and see how many copies they can sell to the litigants who come before them. </TEXT></DOC>
