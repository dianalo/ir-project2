But during the first day of a special EC summit conference, diplomats cautioned that fundamental differences remained and that talks might still collapse.    One British official said he hadn't &quot;seen the elements of a consensus emerging over any of the issues that have been discussed.&quot; But officials from some of the other countries were more optimistic.    A private meeting between British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Spanish counterpart, Felipe Gonzalez, raised hopes of a breakthrough on issues that have been dividing the community for more than a year.    According to sources, Mrs. Thatcher offered concessions on some details in her hard-line stance on slowing the growth of EC farm spending. In exchange, Mr. Gonzalez intimated he might budge on another issue: his insistence the EC double spending on plans to aid the community's poorer regions and the unemployed.    The 12 prime ministers and French President Francois Mitterrand are grappling with the same issues they failed to agree on at their Copenhagen summit in December. The intricate and lengthy list of issues includes proposals on how the member states will fund the EC through 1992, as well as how it will control farm spending. Agricultural expenses currently eat up 70% of the community's budget.    Diplomats said Mrs. Thatcher seemed ready to go along with changes in the way proposed mechanisms to automatically cut farm prices when production exceeds fixed limits would work in controlling overproduction in cereals and oilseeds.    National spokesmen said the leaders also seemed to agree on establishing a special fund to cushion the effect of the dollar's fluctuations on EC farm spending.    Officials said talks on agriculture could easily be derailed, however, in part because of an adamant pro-farmer stance taken yesterday by French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. In talks on fixing a base figure on which future increases in farm spending would be calculated, Mr. Chirac insisted on 29 billion European currency units ($35.41 billion) a year. The figure exceeds proposals from any of the other countries.    Mr. Chirac, who is expected to be a leading candidate in coming French presidential elections, is in a delicate position at the Brussels summit. Farmers account for a significant portion of his political base. But he also has portrayed himself as a leading advocate of the EC's plan to build a unified market by 1992. He therefore doesn't want to incur blame for failure of the summit.    ---   Bank of England on Taxes   LONDON -- The Bank of England suggested Britain's next budget should avoid large tax cuts that might drive up inflation and deepen the country's current-account deficit.    The central bank's comments are a strong hint that Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson will shy away from a tax-cutting bonanza in his March 15 budget announcement for the year starting April 1. Some analysts were expecting big tax reductions until they, too, became concerned about the deteriorating payments deficit.    In its quarterly economic report, released yesterday, the Bank of England said the task of damping still-robust domestic demand in Britain &quot;should be shared by monetary and fiscal policy&quot; alike. It noted monetary policy already played its part when the government directed last week's 0.5-percentage-point rise in commercial banks' base rates, to 9%.    The central bank blamed Britain's rapid import growth largely on domestic demand. But the Bank of England's public advice to Mr. Lawson doesn't rule out tax cuts altogether. Surging economic growth has pushed up wages and forced British taxpayers into higher tax brackets, resulting in soaring tax revenues. For this reason, private London economists expect Mr. Lawson to give back some of that money to avoid braking the economy too harshly. </TEXT></DOC>
