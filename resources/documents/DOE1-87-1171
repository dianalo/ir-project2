<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-1171 </DOCNO><TEXT>The MC-3 Member comprises the uppermost portion of the Mission CanyonFormation in Manitoba. It represents a portion of one of the upper carborate-evaporitecycles in the Mississippian stratigraphic sequence of southwest Manitoba.The MC-3 Member consists of a sequence of lithofacies deposited on ashallow carbonate shelf. Six distinct lithofacies have been recognizedin the Pierson study area and are described in this report. Reservoirrocks in the Pierson pools are primarily coated grain packstones to grainstonesand non-coated grain packstones. Porosity is interparticle, moldic, andintercrystalline. Average reservoir porosity is 14% with average permeabilityof 10 to 12 millidarcies. The multiplicity of trap typers suggests thatthe Pierson and South Pierson Fields are a regional but discontinuous,hydrocarbon accumulation. All traps are primarily stratigraphic. Localtraps, however, may occur where favourable reservoir facies are coincidentwith either paleotopographic highs or on the crest and flanks of truestructural highs. From the previous analysis, it becomes apparent thatsome of the following conditions must be met in order to localize hydrocarbonaccumulation within the regional trap formed by the truncation of theMission Canyon Formation in the Pierson study area: presence of favourablereservoir rocks, and some form of updip and lateral seal developmentby dense, impermeable rocks (altered zone), and/or truncation of resrvoirrocks by the unconformity (erosion) surface. 33 refs., 21 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
