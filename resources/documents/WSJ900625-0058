It's theironly chance to play in the high stakes deficit-reductiongame.   Now they've got their summit. But so far their role hasbeen limited largely to carping about the slow pace of thetalks and threatening to block a deal if it risks theirparty's anti-tax reputation. With the talks at an apparentstalemate, Republican congressional negotiators exerciselittle influence over their Democratic opponents, and notmuch more over their ostensible allies in the White House.</LP><TEXT>   House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.), leader of theanti-tax forces in the House, talks only occasionally. Hismost memorable utterance to date has been an oration againstreviving the draft, participants say. Sen. Bob Packwood (R.,Ore.), who played a key role in past summits, underscores hispessimism by saying little inside the room and declaringoutside that nothing is going to happen until December. Sen.Phil Gramm (R., Texas), an earthy economist best known forthe Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, is such a ferventadvocate of spending cuts that some others discount hisobservations even where they're on the money.   The exception is New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, who hasbeen at the budget game so long that he knows more of thedetails than most others in the room. One of few Republicanswho confronted President Reagan directly about the deficit,Sen. Domenici's obvious frustration with the creaky budgetprocess has abated as he sees a chance to help forge asignificant deficit-reduction pact.   The former budget committee chairman tends to forget thatothers see him as a supporting player. He annoyed White HouseBudget Director Richard Darman the other day by suggestingchanges in Medicare premiums that he hadn't first clearedwith the administration. And sometimes he upstages the budgetcommittee chairman, Sen. James Sasser (D., Tenn.). On theSenate floor one night, Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) was pepperingSen. Sasser with questions about a pending budget resolution.When Sen. Sasser paused to get whispered advice from an aide,Sen. Domenici jumped right in with the answer.   As the leader of the Republican congressional contingentto the budget talks, Sen. Domenici can't move much beyond theWhite House position -- at least right now. But once thesummit gets down to the nitty gritty of shaping adeficit-reduction compromise, he insists there will be timefor &quot;individual initiative&quot; -- including plans for defenseand entitlement spending cuts and tax increases that he andhis staff are putting the finishing touches on.   Sen. Domenici's eagerness to find the deficit deal thathas eluded him for a decade is undisguised. &quot;There are manyproposals around,&quot; he said impatiently last week. &quot;They're indefense . . . in entitlements . . . in taxes,&quot; uttering theword that others shun. &quot;The sooner we put them on the table,the better off we are.&quot; Traditional deficit-fearingRepublicans like Sen. Packwood and House Republican LeaderRobert Michel of Illinois are on his side, but a split amongcongressional Republicans may prevent these men from beingconstructive in the talks.   That's because the one clear role that Rep. Gingrich, Sen.Gramm and their allies may play is that of spoiler: Bythreatening to denounce a compromise, they prevent it fromhappening. One reason the talks are going so slowly is thatDemocrats are determined not to take the blame for taxincreases that many of them believe are necessary. Mr.Darman's new deficit-reduction proposal, which suggestsdeeper spending cuts but no more taxes or other revenues thanthose included in the president's January budget, reinforcesDemocrats' suspicions.   Republicans fed Democrats' fears with a round of speecheson the House floor this spring. &quot;Sometimes I had the feelingthey were putting up signs to show the animals: This way tothe trap,&quot; says House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta(D., Calif.).   Simply put, anti-tax Republicans figure they have a vetoat the summit -- and they're feeling their oats. Sen. Grammsays flatly, &quot;I can't envision a circumstance where the WhiteHouse would sign off on a budget agreement if I objected.&quot;Republican congressional staffers say that Sen. Gramm andRep. Gingrich were named to the summit negotiating team byRepublican leaders who figured they would be more likely tohelp sell any resulting compromise if they participated inreaching it.   That ploy might just work. Mr. Darman acknowledges thatsome people were concerned that the fiery Mr. Gingrich mightnot play by the rules of budget summitry, &quot;which essentiallyrequire that you be relatively temperate.&quot; So far, he says,Mr. Gingrich has &quot;favorably surprised some people.&quot;   Because it's understood that the Democrats won't back adeficit-reduction package unless a majority of Republicans dotoo, Republicans say they wield more power than usual. &quot;Inthe Congress, we have no role other than to get overrun bythe Democrat majority,&quot; says Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota,senior Republican on the House Budget Committee. &quot;When we areworking with Big Brother {the White House} we have the cloutwe don't have in the House of Representatives.&quot;   Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady don'tignore their congressional brethren. The two travel toCapitol Hill to caucus -- usually once a week -- with theRepublican negotiators. But Mr. Frenzel says the talksusually center on what's likely to happen at the nextsession. &quot;We haven't counseled closely on the ultimateoutcome,&quot; he says. President Bush has invited the Republicansummit team to the White House this afternoon for a pep talk,congressional staffers say.   In past budget summits, Republican lawmakers occasionallyhave moved talks forward by offering a proposal, giving bothDemocrats and the White House something to talk about withouteither taking the blame for presenting it. But this time,Republican congressional leaders aren't likely to performthat service. Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.)is still smarting from the drubbing he took in the 1988 NewHampshire Republican primary after George Bush unveiled his&quot;no new taxes&quot; line. He isn't enthusiastic about doing Mr.Bush's dirty work by proposing tax increases now.   What's more, Democrats insist that they won't settle for avaguely Republican proposal. They want a deficit-reductionplan with George Bush's fingerprints on it, and they rejectthe one the White House sent over last week as nothing morethan a warmed over version of Mr. Bush's January budget.   To underscore the point, Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.)delights in quoting to Mr. Darman and Treasury SecretaryBrady excerpts from a speech that a Texas Republicancongressman named George Bush made in June 1967 urging theHouse to reject an increase in the debt ceiling thatPresident Johnson was seeking.   &quot;We had better tell the administration again to takeanother look at their figures and come back to the Congresswith some constructive proposal for reducing the amount ofthe deficit,&quot; Mr. Bush said back then.</TEXT></DOC>
