Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,declared Friday as the Senate approved the bill 57-32. ``Businessis not fair. It's no use crying and moaning about fairness. We'vegot to do something.''   The bill, designed to limit foreign competition to selected U.S.industries, would freeze this year's textile and apparel imports at1987 levels and limit growth to 1 percent annually from then on.   Imports of nonrubber footwear would be capped at 1987 levelswith no increases in market share for foreign manufacturers allowed.   Supporters say it would save American jobs while critics counterthat it would raise prices, narrow consumer choices and throw awrench into the gears of international trade.   The House also plans action this week on the drug issue,including debate on proposals to fine users $10,000 and prod statesto cancel their driver's licenses. The Senate, meanwhile, mustdecide what to do with a $140 billion social programs spending billthat has become snarled in the abortion issue.   The Reagan administration is vowing an all-out effort to blockthe textile bill, even if it means an election-eve battle tosustain a presidential veto.   Opponents of the bill managed to keep it bottled up in theSenate over the weekend, even though it already has won approval.   A second vote is needed to send the measure to the House, whichalready has passed a similar bill and must now vote upon Senatechanges in the legislation.   The opponents threatened to filibuster the second vote and itappeared that the Senate would not be able to wash its hands of thebill until Tuesday or even later. But there is no question thatsupporters will eventually get the bill to the House and thisweek's dispute mainly represents a mopping up action.   The drug bill before the House would add another $2 billion ontop of the $3.9 billion now being spent annually by the federalgovernment on anti-drug efforts. In addition to debating whether topenalize drug users, the House will try to decide whether to keepin the bill a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers.   An amendment being offered by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., woulddrop the waiting period in favor of a voluntary system under whichdealers could check by phone or other means on whether a would-begun buyer had ever been convicted of a felony.   The drug bill appears headed for a vote Thursday or Friday.   Those favoring a harsh crackdown succeeded last week inattaching provisions calling for a federal death penalty, nogovernment benefits for twice-convicted users and court use ofevidence seized illegally if police obtained it while acting ``ingood faith.''   This week, Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., will propose civilpenalties of up to $10,000 per violation against those possessingeven small ``personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine, andother drugs.   Rep. Glenn M. Anderson, D-Calif., is pushing a proposal toprovide up to $125 million over three years to states that orderdrivers license suspensions or revocations for convicted drugusers. McCollum has a variant that would dock states some of theirfederal highway money unless they adopted the penalty.   Senators passed the social spending bill with an expansion ofthe Medicaid program to cover abortions for rape and incestvictims. But the House on Friday refused to accept that provisionin the Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services spendingbill.   The House this week also is expected to pass an insider tradingbill that, for the first time, would clear the way for finingsecurities firms for violations committed by their employees.   Maximum jail terms for insider trading would be increased fromfive to 10 years, and maximum criminal fines would go from $500,00to $2.5 million per violation for companies; and from $100,000 to$1 million for individuals.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans a vote Wednesday ona bill that would impose harsh sanctions on South Africa.   Similar to a House-passed bill, it would end virtually all U.S.investment in South Africa and trade with that country because ofits apartheid policy of racial segregation. But prospects for themeasure on the Senate floor appear dim, with only a few weeksremaining before adjournment.</TEXT></DOC>
