Walters said Iran and Iraq clearly had decided to end their warin the Persian Gulf and that it would take some time for fightingto taper off because of `'pent-up hostility'' on the two sides.   ``After an eight-year war,'' Walters said, ``I don't considertwo weeks an excessive time'' to work out cease-fire terms.   The U.S. diplomat recalled the protracted negotiations that wererequired to end the wars in Korea and Vietnam.   Iranian gunboats fired at the Norwegian tanker after it hadrefused to stop for inspection, shipping executives in the gulfsaid. The captain said a few bullets pierced the ship but caused noinjuries.   Walters, appearing on a U.S.-sponsored telecast to the area,said ``any attack on neutral shipping is to be reprehended. It iswrong.''   He said he was ``quite surprised'' by the attack, and added:``Attacks on neutral shipping by belligerents are not justifiableby any circumstances.''   And yet, Walter said, ``I think this was a case of excessivezeal by a local commander. I think both countries have maintainedthat their national choice is for peace.''   ``What we are witnessing is some of the bitterness and some ofthe hostility of eight years of war manifesting itself.'' Walterssaid. ``But in my view the two countries have made the choice forpeace.''   For the second time this week, the U.S. ambassador supportedIraq's demand for face-to-face negotiations with Iran.   ``I don't believe it is possible for two countries to make peacewithout face-to-face discussions,'' he said. ``I have never heardof a peace being achieved entirely through third parties.''   His statement raised questions about U.S. policy on the issue.   Phyllis Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman, renewed theU.S. call for swift implementation of the cease-fire without``conditions that only prolong'' the delay.   The United Nations Security Council's cease-fire resolution doesprescribe direct negotiations between the two sides.   ``But,'' Watlers said, ``it is perfectly obvious thatface-to-face talks must take place between the two parties who havebeen at war.''   On another subject, the U.S. ambassador called for participationby ``some sort of Palestinian delegation'' in Arab-Israeli peace.   But a State Department official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said Walters' remarks did not mean a change in U.S.policy.   The Reagan administration has called for Palestinianparticipation, but not in a separate delegation. The plan forwardedby Secretary of State George P. Shultz calls for Palestinians toparticipate in a joint delegation with Jordan.   Walters stressed that Jordan must take part in any negotiationsin view of its border with Israel.   On Sunday, King Hussein announced he was severing legal andadministrative links to the West Bank and surrendering the areas'future to the Palestine Liberation Organization.   The territory, with a predominantly Palestinian Arab population,was held by Jordan from 1948 until 1967 and by Israel since then.</TEXT></DOC>
