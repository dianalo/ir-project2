The company said it will ask Teamsters union locals representing 8,000 workers in 300 cities to vote on the pay cut. About 250 additional workers at the unit's corporate office also will be asked to accept reduced pay. In exchange, the company is offering the employees an Employee Stock Ownership Plan that will own 12.5% of the company and a profit-sharing plan.    Robert A. Young III, president and chief executive officer, said in an employee newsletter, &quot;We beat the raiders. Now we must pay the price for security.&quot; Mr. Young said he would take a pay cut.    The company was acquired by Kelso andamp; Co., a New York investment banking firm, escaping a hostile takeover bid by Razorback Partners, made up of two New York partnerships.    Pay cuts don't apply to the 3,650 employees of Arkansas Best's furniture-making unit or its tire-retreading business. </TEXT></DOC>
