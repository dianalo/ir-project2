They did not report any injuries but said the gangs, suspected ofbeing the cartel's hired thugs, stopped the official vehiclesincluding trucks and vans and set them afire in sporadic attacksthroughout the day.   There were these other developments:   _The army said it had arrested a pilot, Nicolas Gonzalez Cardona,who flew cocaine to the United States for Pablo Escobar, Colombia'smost notorious cocaine baron.   _Police said one of Escobar's top aides was released because theyhad no arrest warrant or U.S. extradition request for the suspect.They reported that Luis Fernando Galeano Berrio was released from aBogota jail Thursday.   _A newspaper poll indicated more than 75 percent of Colombianssupport the government's 3-week-old war on drug traffickers butoppose the presence of foreign soldiers to help in the fight.   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, police Col.Oscar Pelaez Carmona said Galeano was released because policeholding him lacked the required legal papers, including an arrestwarrant and an extradition request from the United States.   The missing paperwork was supposed to have accompanied Galeanowhen he was transferred from a Medellin army base to a Bogota jail.   In Washington, a spokesman for the Drug EnforcementAdministration, Frank Shultz, said Galeano was not wanted in theUnited States and there were no charges against him there.   Pelaez said Galeano was arrested a month ago in Medellin and washeld for three weeks at an army base in Medellin and brought lastweek to Bogota.   Galeano was captured days before the government began anationwide drug crackdown, launched after terrorists assassinated onAug. 18 Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a presidential candidate andanti-drug crusader.   A U.S. official in Colombia said the crackdown on drugs had cutthe cocaine trade by up to 50 percent, but that much of the $65million worth of military airplanes and hardware donated by theUnited States was not suited to the job.   In response to a question, the official said the eight A-37warplanes cannot be used to bomb cocaine labs and the only way toemploy them may be to help force down suspected drug flights.   ``All of this stuff came from stockpiles the military had. It ishard to take stuff out that stockpile and make it applicable'' toanti-narcotics work, he said.   Gonzalez Cardona, a pilot who allegedly ferried cocaine to theUnited States, was being held in Medellin, the 4th Army Brigade inMedellin announced.   It said Gonzalez Cardona was ``a pilot in the service ofnarcotics trafficer Pablo Escobar, making international flights onone of the Medellin cartel's main routes for distributing (cocaine)between Colombia and the cities of Miami and New York, amongothers.''   The Medellin cartel is believed to supply 80 percent of thecocaine consumed in the United States.   Gonzalez Cardona was arrested in a roundup that followed the Aug.17 assassination of Col. Waldemar Francklin Quintero, Medellin's toppolice official.   Escobar, who is in hiding, tops the list of drug figures wantedin the United States. He is said to head a $3 billion worldwidecocaine empire.   Colombia has offered a $250,000 reward for information leading tohis capture.   The government of President Virgilio Barco began a nationwidecrackdown following the assassination of Sen. Galan.   Barco declared a state of siege and said he would extradite drugfigures wanted in the United States. Millions of dollars inpossessions of drug lords have been seized and hundreds of peoplehave been rounded up, but top drug lords remain at large.   The man who reputedly laundered hundreds of millions of dollarsfor cocaine cartels, Eduardo Martinez Romero, was the first personextradited to the United States under the current crackdown. He wasbeing held under tight security in Atlanta pending a Monday hearing.   The poll by the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo, the Caracol radionetwork and a private consulting firm showed 75.8 percent of thosequestioned in four cities favored the government's actions and 24percent opposed. The remainder had no opinion.   Colombians also were overwhelmingly in favor of extraditing drugfigures and the seizure of their bank accounts and property.   But Colombians opposed 80 percent to 20 percent the presence offoreign military personnel in Colombia to aid with the crackdown.   The pollsters did not give their polling techniques or the poll'smargin of error.   President Bush approved the special military aid for Colombia'santi-narcotics forces and sent transport planes, helicopters andfighter jets to Colombia last week.   The Pentagon said up to 200 U.S. military personnel would have tocome to Colombia to set up the equipment and show Colombians how touse it.   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidFriday in Bogota that the military equipment shipped to Colombia sofar was merely ``symbolic'' and not adequate for anti-drugoperations.   He said the crackdown ``is not running out of gas'' and estimatedit has cut the drug flow in Colombia by ``maybe 25 to 50 percent.''</TEXT></DOC>
