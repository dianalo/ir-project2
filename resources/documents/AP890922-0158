The compromise authored by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and MajorityLeader George Mitchell, D-Maine, is designed to win support fortheir acid-rain proposal.   Baucus' home state of Montana, as well as Kansas, Minnesota,North Dakota, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming would be exempted becausethey use scrubbers on more than 50 percent of their coal-firedgenerating capacity. Scrubbers are pollution-control devices thatuse a spray of water to trap pollutants and cool emissions.   Acid rain reduction will be one-third of any clean-airlegislation passed by Congress, along with curbing ozone pollutionand controlling airborne toxic chemicals.   Bush has submitted a comprehensive clean air bill to Congressthat's moving through the amendment process. It is before the HouseEnergy and Commerce environment subcommittee.   The Senate has not begun to amend clean-air legislation, but isexpected to use the Baucus-Mitchell compromise as the vehicle whenthe process begins there.   Mitchell and Baucus said at a news conference that their planalso calls for a 10 million ton reduction of sulfur dioxide over1980 levels _ the same improvement President Bush wants.   Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides arechemically transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric or nitricacids, sometimes carried hundreds of miles in the air, and return toearth in rain or snow.   The pollution has been associated with destruction of aquaticlife in lakes, decline of forests, deterioration of buildings andhuman lung damage.   The Senate compromise also would:   _Achieve the 10 million ton sulfur dioxide reduction by Jan. 1,2000, while the Bush plan targets the end of the year for the sameresult.   _A requirement that emissions couldn't increase once thereduction is achieved, a cap that also is a feature of the Bushlegislation.   _Place the burden for the initial sulfur dioxide reductions on 20power plants burning dirty coal rather than the 107 plants thatwould carry the burden under the Bush legislation.   _A 2 million ton reduction by the start of 2000 for nitrogenoxides. The Bush bill would slow growth of that pollutant, but stillpermit an increase of 1 million tons in the air over the next decade.   _Provide that new sources of acid rain emissions take intoaccount the efficiency of the power plant, which could be animportant factor in easing global warming.   Every region of the United States wants to reduce acid rain, butthere are fierce disputes about who will pay the bill.   The states that would benefit from the compromise contend theyare victimized by a provision in current law that requires that allnew coal-fired power plants use scrubbers, including those that burnso-called ``clean'' low sulfur coal mined in the West.   The requirement, Baucus said, ``has imposed a huge andenvironmentally unjustified burden on the West. Today we propose toend that hoax.''   Mitchell said ``millions of dollars have been spent'' on thescrubbers by states that suffered the ``adverse effects'' of currentlaw even though their coal-fired plants produce little pollution.   After 2000, the Mitchell-Baucus plan would eliminate the scrubberprovision for new plants.   The compromise plan doesn't address another regional dispute thatremains to be negotiated: the contention of nine mostly Midwesternstates that they would be paying a disproportionate share of acidrain reductions.   The brunt of the cost would be passed on to electic ratepayerswhose utilities burn polluting, high sulfur coal.</TEXT></DOC>
