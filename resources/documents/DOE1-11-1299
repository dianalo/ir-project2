<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-11-1299 </DOCNO><TEXT>A number of improvements have been suggested for the taking and wrappingof samples, as well as more efficient conditions for their combustionin a flask with oxygen. This allowed a previously proposed procedurefor determining fluorine to be extended to new classes of substancesof different types: low boiling point, volatile, and sublimating compounds,tough heteroorganic substances containing many metals and nonmetals.It has been shown that it is possible to eliminate the interference froma number of heteroelements during the combustion step by the self-partitioningof the burned material. The fluorides in the absorbing solution are determinedphotometrically from the fading of the thorium complex with ArsenazoI.</TEXT></DOC>
