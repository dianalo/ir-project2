By now, consumers nationwide could have been taking advantage of all kinds of special services through their telephone lines -- checking airline schedules or baseball scores, tracking prices of their favorite stocks, arranging to watch pay-for-view movies on their TV sets. A phone call from the office would turn on the dishwasher or start dinner cooking at home.    But dinner isn't even thawed. A dispute among the regional Bell operating companies, regulators and information-service providers is delaying development of a new telephone network structure. Without it, most new-fangled services can't reach homes or workplaces.    Of course, custom-calling features, which are provided by the phone companies, are available just about everywhere. And some other services -- such as voice mail, electronic mail and audiotex products like weather updates -- are already available in some markets, but there isn't any integrated network yet for their delivery on a national basis.    Moreover, once the telephone network is restructured, say information-service suppliers, many new services could be developed and made widely available. To contrast the current, limited development of the industry with its potential, some experts draw an analogy to country back roads vs. interstate highways.    The dispute centers on a policy concept known as Open Network Architecture -- a way to let the information-service companies tap into the telephone network and deliver their offerings. The parties can't seem to agree on pricing or structure for an open network.    Stakes are high, especially for companies that already have an upper hand. The burgeoning information industry promises cash flow high in the billions, and the Bell companies hope to keep for themselves as much as half the fees that these services will produce.    For consumers, costs may vary from 50 cents for a single horoscope call and a few dollars a month for a feature like call forwarding to $20 or more for one fairly sophisticated data report. The market's potential size isn't clear because the industry is still in its infancy, but industry sources believe it could soar as high as $50 billion a year by 1995. Just one segment, computer-generated information services available through phone lines, brought in more than $1.6 billion of revenues last year, according to the Commerce Department's telecommunications information agency.    The Federal Communications Commission wants to resolve differences before the next president takes office. It hopes to implement a specific plan by the end of 1989. So far, however, there isn't much to show for the process, and the whole effort may be stalled indefinitely if the agency doesn't act before the next administration takes office.    Last year, the FCC ordered the Bell operating companies and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. to submit plans for opening up their networks. &quot;Some 7,000 pages of complicated, jargon-laden plans have been sent to the FCC,&quot; explains a telecommunications expert based in Washington. &quot;No one really knows what the plans say.&quot;    From the FCC's viewpoint, a major goal is to give network access to everybody under standard rules, so that the agency won't continue to get bogged down in policing the industry a case at a time.    ATandamp;T and the Bells are information-service vendors, too, and one objective of federal regulators is to help put other service providers on the same footing with them -- creating what is known, in the industry cliche, as &quot;a level playing field.&quot; But so far, the process has produced only a battlefield.    The Bells are jockeying to keep as much control as they can, while independent vendors are demanding maximum latitude of choice at the lowest possible price. Meanwhile, some state regulators complain that the FCC is sticking its nose where it doesn't belong.    Information-service companies and the Bells can't agree on how the telephone network's &quot;building blocks&quot; -- for example, various types of call-forwarding and call-waiting features -- should be sold. Most Bells propose to continue selling the blocks in bundles or packages -- much the same as a car dealer would offer, say, power brakes, power steering and air conditioning in an indivisible options package.    But information-service vendors, wary of the Bells' monopolistic tradition, insist on the right to buy only the parts they will need. Some vendors may want to offer a very simple call-forwarding service without having to purchase extra features.    &quot;Everyone is trying to get a competitive advantage,&quot; acknowledges William L. Weiss, chairman and chief executive officer of Chicago-based Ameritech Inc., the Bell company in the Midwest. &quot;It's to our benefit to open the network to everyone who wants to use it. What we have to do is unbundle the network in a way that doesn't put us at a disadvantage to a company like IBM.&quot;    Critics of the Bells argue that information-service providers ought to be able to buy only the elements they need. Robert Morris, a telecommunications industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., says he suspects the Bells are &quot;stonewalling to protect their monopoly position&quot; in areas like custom-calling features.    But some Bell companies argue that the network's building blocks need to be sold in packages to keep from putting a dangerous strain on the network. &quot;If the power steering protects the air conditioning, then we'll sell it that way,&quot; says Robert M. Wolfe, a vice president at a BellSouth Corp. subsidiary. &quot;The computer buffs don't understand that. They're used to having their systems fail. Our networks don't operate that way.&quot;    Pricing has also contributed to the ruckus. Information-service vendors want the network's building blocks to be priced primarily on the basis of cost. But most Bells favor setting prices according to what the market will bear.    Historically, the Bell System marketed services according to a social pricing system -- emphasizing low prices to encourage universal use. But the breakup of Ma Bell in 1984 brought in a new environment driven by profits. Explains BellSouth's Mr. Wolfe: &quot;We aren't in this for charity anymore. It's a business. We aren't going to give it away.&quot;    Many parties find the Bells' stance unacceptable. In a recent filing with the FCC, International Business Machines Corp. demanded that the Bell companies unwrap their network building blocks and establish consistent plans for a national network. IBM also protested that the Bells' current plans &quot;barely touch on future network design,&quot; even though future design is supposed to be an essential element of the plan.    Moreover, the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration has joined IBM, CompuServe Inc. and others in urging the FCC to set clear, tough guidelines. They also want the agency to send the Bells back to the drawing board.    Pacific Telesis Group acknowledges that its current plans aren't very elaborate. But Stephen M. Schuppert of the company's Pacific Bell Services unit contends that's because the FCC warned the Bell companies to refrain from spelling out any services that couldn't be offered to consumers within a year. &quot;That makes it difficult to be futuristic,&quot; he says.    Meanwhile, the feuding goes on. Ameritech's Mr. Weiss worries that the country can't afford prolonged bickering because foreign information-service providers are invading the market through separate services. &quot;If we don't settle our disputes soon,&quot; he warns, &quot;the foreign companies may step in and dominate.&quot;    ---                     Measurements of Growth   Revenues of some telephone-based information services, in millions.
