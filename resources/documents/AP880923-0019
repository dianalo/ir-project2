Gorbachev isproposing that interim limits be placed on the most potent U.S. andSoviet long-range nuclear weapons to keep arms control momentumgoing, U.S. officials say.   Gorbachev's proposal was sent to the State Department beforeSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze began talks Thursdaywith Secretary of State George P. Shultz on a wide range of armscontrol measures, human rights and regional problems.   The U.S. side is willing to consider the proposal, but willemphasize that any limitations on nuclear weapons must bereinforced with strict verification measures to guard againstviolations, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said Thursday.   These include assurances there will be no interference with themonitoring of test flights of the strategic nuclear missiles thatcarry the warheads and have ranges of 3,500 miles and beyond.   After a session today with Vice President George Bush andanother round with Shultz concentrating on problems in the MiddleEast, southern Africa and Southeast Asia, the Soviet foreignminister had a session scheduled at the White House with PresidentReagan.   A joint statement was to be issued then ``to mark the progressthat's been achieved,'' and Shultz and Shevardnadze were to holdseparate news conferences in the evening, a U.S. official said.   It was not clear whether an agreement on temporary ceilingscould be reached during the two-day visit. The Soviets did notraise the proposal in the first sessions on Thursday, the U.S.official said.   The United States and the Soviet Union set goals for limitingwarheads at the summit last December. Gorbachev wants to put thoselimits into effect on an interim basis, separate from other armsissues.   These would include a ceiling of 10 warheads on U.S.ground-launched MX missiles and eight on submarine-launchedTridents, while the Soviets would be held to 10 warheads on theirSS-18 and SS-20 missiles, the official said.   Shevardnadze carried a range of other arms control proposals toShultz along with a letter from Gorbachev to Reagan.   ``The agenda is very broad, but we have little time,''Shevardnadze told reporters.   He singled out two obstacles to a Strategic Arms ReductionTreaty (START) as included in the ``full-scope negotiations'' hewas holding with Shultz. They involved restrictions to be imposedon the range of non-ballistic cruise missiles that can be launchedby bombers and warships and ways of verifying that any agreed-uponcutbacks on their number are not exceeded.   Shultz met with Shevardnadze for 6{ hours and afterwarddescribed their discussion of arms control issues and human rightsas ``very constructive and very detailed.''   Negotiators in Geneva have been unable to resolve theseproblems, as well as related questions dealing with Reagan'sStrategic Defense Initiative, the search for a space-based shieldagainst Soviet ballistic missiles.   Immediately after Shultz greeted Shevardnadze, teams of U.S. andSoviet experts began private deliberations on the twin issues ofreducing strategic nuclear weapons and on anti-missile defenses.Veteran American and Soviet negotiators Paul H. Nitze and Viktor P.Karpov headed their respective delegations.   Shevardnadze also singled out hoped-for reductions inconventional weapons in Europe as a major item on the Sovietagenda. ``We want to see where we are, where we stand and what theprospects are,'' he said. ``We believe there are some goodprospects.''   Negotiations in Vienna are stalled over U.S. demands that theSoviets give equal weight to human rights in any negotiationsbetween the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pactto reduce troops, tanks and other conventional armaments from theAtlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.   ``We have specific proposals in many areas,'' Shevardnadze said,adding that the discussions in Washington would cover nuclear andspace weapons and conventional armaments and chemical weapons aswell.   Even before Shevardnadze's arrival, some U.S. officials wereoptimistic that an agreement could be reached on verifyingcompliance with a 1976 treaty to limit underground nuclear testsfor so-called peaceful purposes to 150 kilotons.   The idea is to clear the way for Reagan to submit the treaty tothe Senate for ratification before he leaves office in January.   Wrapping up a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles is amuch tougher and more important task. Reagan had hoped to completethe accord during his second term as evidence that he is committedto rolling back the nuclear arms race.   On Thursday, an Armenian demonstrator managed to getShevardnadze's attention during a break in the foreign minister'stalks with Shultz.   Amvarsam Khlgatian, 61, had been standing for two hours acrossthe street carrying a placard that read,``Gorbachev, Let Me VisitMy Dying Mother.''   As Shevardnadze's motorcade started for the Soviet Embassy, theman dashed into the street carrying his sign. The motorcade stoppedand security agents wrestled Khlgatian to the ground.   Shevardnadze left his limousine to talk to the demonstrator fora few minutes.   ``He said, `Don't worry, I`ll take care of it,''' Khlgatian saidafterward. ``But he can do nothing. It's up to the KGB.''   The protester said he was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1979after serving 15 years in labor camps for attempting to escape tothe West. He said he works as a machinist in New York.   Khlgatian gave Shevardnadze a leaflet in which he described hismother as 80 years old and fatally ill. It said Gorbachev, despitepromises of humanization, had kept him from visiting her inYerevan, the Armenian capital.</TEXT></DOC>
