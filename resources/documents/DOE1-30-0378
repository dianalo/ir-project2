The technique called Computerized Tomo-angiography (CTA)is applicable in the assessing of the location and extent of mediastinalmass lesions and in determining whether the lesions are isolated or multiple.It has also been found useful in determining lesion vascularity, in evaluatinganeurysms and aortic dissection, in evaluating cardiac and pericardialdisease and in assessing patients with superior vena cava syndrome. Thetext is divided into three main sections - technical considerations,normal anatomy, and abnormal anatomy. The normal anatomy section correlatesenhanced CT images with cross-sectional anatomical sections and withillustrative diagrams and explanatory text. In each chapter, advantagesand disadvantages as well as the limitations of the technique are described.</TEXT></DOC>
