U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell issued an order specifyingthat North's filing outlining his opposition would be sealed toprotect references to a grand jury transcript. The filing was madeWednesday, the judge's order said.   Gesell had earlier scheduled a hearing for next Wednesday in theevent that North opposed the subpoena for the notebooks, whichdetail his involvement in the Contra resupply operation as well asthe Reagan administration's arms sales to Iran.   North used the spiral-bound stenographer's notebooks from Feb. 1,1983 until the day he was fired, Nov. 25, 1986, when theadministration disclosed that a portion of the proceeds from theIran arms sales had been diverted to the Contras fighting theleftist government in Nicaragua.   Portions of the notebooks were turned over to the congressionalIran-Contra investigating committees and disclosed during hearings.
