Useof spread spectrum radiolocation offers real-time extraction and correctionof system biases eliminating fixed timing errors. An unlimited numberof users may receive differential signals as well as system descriptiondata in such a manner as to facilitate complete &quot;blind&quot; entry into thesystem while attaining full operational capability. Utilizing a proprietarytechnique, the passive user obtains additional lines of position as wellas calibration information while using the traditional number of referencestations. A single frequency could be used world-wide since &quot;networks&quot;are identified by code. Adjacent networks can be indicated to the receiverusing the system description data thus facilitating network to networkoperation without operator intervention. Although the system accuracyis excellent for survey, the automation of dynamic precise positioningis most advantageous in vehicle location.</TEXT></DOC>
