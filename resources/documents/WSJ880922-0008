Concerned about the cost, Congress has balked. But quietly, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has been doing it anyway. Instead of creating a new agency to do the job, the board's Southwest Plan is using thrifts themselves as its storehouse.    By guaranteeing acquirers market returns on the troubled assets of the 49 sick thrifts it has merged this year in Texas and Oklahoma, the Bank Board in effect is paying the acquirers to sit on those problem loans. Moreover, the board appears to be giving the acquirers little incentive to manage those assets well, since it typically pledges to make up any loss they may take on the book value of the loans.    According to private lawyers and accountants, the Bank Board's guarantees cover about 75% of the merged thrifts' assets. If Southwest real estate values recover soon, thus restoring the value of the loans, the guarantees won't cost much. But if values continue to fall, the Bank Board's bill will soar.    &quot;It's a form of regulatory gambling,&quot; says Edward Kane, an economics professor at Ohio State University.    Already, spreading predictions that it will cost $50 billion or more to rescue insolvent thrifts have both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue buzzing with concern. Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) plans to call today for Congress to cough up at least $20 billion next year to help bail out the thrift industry.    Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called for his agency to evaluate evidence that contradicts its long-held position that the Bank Board doesn't need more help. An answer, along with recommendations for what to do next, isn't due until after the Nov. 8 election.    In a draft of a speech he plans to deliver today, Sen. Proxmire charges that the Reagan administration has been burying its head in the sand while the regulators have entered &quot;sham resolutions&quot; that attract little new capital to failing thrifts but raise Bank Board commitments beyond its ability to pay.    The Bank Board calls its guarantee-assisted mergers &quot;resolutions&quot; that remove the sick thrifts from its insolvent list. But in fact, the mergers leave the agency still bearing the full risk of continuing losses on almost all of the &quot;resolved&quot; thrifts' loans.    Some critics say such arrangements don't solve much. The Bank Board &quot;is taking the risk and giving much of the upside {profit potential} to private individuals,&quot; charges Lowell Bryan a New York-based consultant with McKinsey andamp; Co. &quot;The liability for the government is unchanged.&quot;    The guarantees do discourage the &quot;dumping&quot; on an already weak market the thousands of office buildings and shopping centers that are in default. They do that by giving thrift acquirers a strong incentive to hold the bad loans and foreclosed real estate they are obtaining.    For instance, one acquirer, Southwest Savings andamp; Loan Association, Dallas, is guaranteed a healthy 2.75% return above the average cost of funds in Texas, declining to a 2% annual premium after six years of a 10-year agreement.    A well-run savings institution should hold its operating costs to about 1.5% of its assets, so such an agreement guarantees operating profits to any institution that keeps costs in line, according to William Isaac, former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall has said that the Southwest Savings arrangement was a &quot;loss leader,&quot; used to attract more bidders for insolvent thrifts. Later deals phase the yield maintenance down to the local cost of funds plus 1.6%.    Southwest Savings' arrangement also covers it for all losses on the original book value of the loans, and it allows Southwest to share profits if assets are sold for more than their original value. But critics say that it's unlikely that the assets, which in many cases have sunk to below half their original value, will rebound anytime soon. So they question whether Southwest has much incentive to manage the assets efficiently.    Other sick-thrift takeover arrangements vary. In one, the acquirer would share any returns above 80% of original book value. But the Bank Board has withheld details on most of them, claiming that disclosure would weaken its negotiating position with other bidders. The secrecy has frustrated analysts, reporters and lawmakers who have been anxious to examine the incentives and costs.    The Bank Board says it has run up guarantees totaling $7.5 billion to southwestern thrifts in the past six weeks. But by its own admission, the Bank Board has grossly underestimated the ultimate cost of thrift rescues, and its credibility is low. Analysts worry that the actual cost will be much higher.    &quot;What will it cost? Nobody knows,&quot; says Mr. Bryan. &quot;The deals are wrapped in secrecy.&quot;    In May, the bank board put the total cost of resolving savings and loan problems at $22.7 billion. In July, it raised that estimate to $30.9 billion, and officials recently have said they're going to have to raise the figure again. Most analysts put the cost at more than $50 billion.    For the Bank Board, the capital and yield guarantees have the advantage that they don't have to be reflected immediately as budget outlays. Their cost isn't counted until it is spent. And since these guarantees were little used until recently, they have largely escaped scrutiny. While most of them were being issued, Congress was distracted by recesses, year-end legislation and re-election campaigns.    Some lawmakers worry that the guarantees, by artificially inflating the net worth of the newly merged thrifts, will create a misleading impression that the Texas industry is recovering. In fact, they say, the newly merged institutions are dependent on a government-financed life-support system: The acquirers are using their government guarantees effectively to mark up bad loans to original book value, enabling them to eliminate reserves for losses. As a result, Texas thrifts are expected soon to start reporting large gains even though the loans are still bad.    Some Democrats charge that Bank Board Chairman Wall, a former Republican Senate staffer, is using the guarantees to keep a lid on the thrift crisis until November so as to shield Vice President George Bush from criticism during his presidential campaign. &quot;All it is is a paper shuffling to get them through until January,&quot; agrees McKinsey's Mr. Bryan.    But all sides acknowledge that the Bank Board has an almost impossible task. It must contend with about 500 insolvent thrifts, which have been losing almost $1 billion a month. Even with $10.8 billion in new borrowing authority, its resources are dwarfed by the problem.    &quot;You have to play with the cards you're dealt,&quot; said Thomas Vartanian, a former Bank Board general counsel. He praises the board for coming out of a period of inactivity. &quot;The fact that we're seeing deals done is a very positive sign,&quot; he says.    &quot;But they're not real deals,&quot; protests Paul Horvitz, professor of banking and finance at the University of Houston and a director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. &quot;There's a big chance that many of these will come back to bite him {Mr. Wall} again. Or, given the way the system works, to bite his successor.&quot;    One problem is that new investors aren't bringing new capital into the industry. For the 24 sick Texas thrifts that were married off to private owners in August, acquirers put up only about $82.5 million in new, outside capital to take over $8.4 billion in assets. That left them with paper-thin capital to withstand losses. Bank Board officials note that since most of the assets are guaranteed, a large capital cushion isn't needed: In other words, the Bank Board, through its Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. arm, is providing the cushion.    Bank Board use of complex arrangements to warehouse thrift losses isn't new. In the early 1980s, the agency first bunched insolvent thrifts and ran them under the &quot;Phoenix&quot; program. It also has taken over scores of thrifts and assigned them new managers under its control. In many cases, both programs have increased the ultimate cost of the insolvencies.    The better-heeled FDIC retains the bulk of the bad loans on failed banks that it merges with stronger partners. But unlike the Bank Board, it doesn't subsidize acquirers for holding the assets by guaranteeing them a return on the bad loans. FDIC Chairman William Seidman stopped the practice because he said the costs were &quot;potentially devastating.&quot;    Even the Bank Board has shown some skittishness about the practice. In 1982, it decided to stop providing yield and capital guarantees, Mr. Vartanian says, believing they are &quot;too costly&quot; a way to buy new management. </TEXT></DOC>
