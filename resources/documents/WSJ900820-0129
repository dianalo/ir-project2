Separately, Los Angeles-based Far West said it took anadditional $16.9 million in loss reserves for the secondquarter, resulting in an expected second-quarter loss of $3.7million, or 47 cents a share. A year ago, the company had netincome of $10.8 million, or $1.38 a share.</LP><TEXT>   Far West said the six-month loss is expected to total$29.9 million, or $3.83 a share, compared with profit of$16.3 million, or $2.09 a share, in 1989.   The continued financial hemorrhage and the OTS action putFar West at risk of even harsher sanctions that could includefederal seizure. The Belzberg family of Canada, whichcontrols the company, could elect to recapitalize Far Westand bring it out of its spiral. Far West foundered afteramassing one of the largest junk-bond portfolios in theindustry.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, FarWest fell 25 cents to $1.25.   The company's principal operating unit, Far West Savings andamp;Loan Association, failed to meet regulatory capitalrequirements, and filed a capital plan that was amended inMay.   However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s SanFrancisco office ruled that a major part of that plan, theproposed liquidation of the unit holding the company's junkbonds into Far West Savings, was &quot;impermissible,&quot; accordingto Far West Financial President Charles Green.   Far West protested the regional office's opinion as&quot;incorrect,&quot; and appealed the matter to FDIC in Washington.However, pending resolution by FDIC headquarters, Far Westsaid that on Aug. 13 it was notified by letter that the OTStoo had rejected the capital plan.   The OTS action precludes Far West from buying or sellingany assets, or making any new loans or commitments withoutprior approval from the San Francisco office of OTS.   In an interview, Mr. Green said the company's capital planwas based on the proposed liquidation into the thrift of theunit that owns all of the company's high-yield, or junkbonds, valued at $395 million as of June 30.   &quot;Liquidation of that unit into Far West Savings wasdesigned to accomplish certain tax strategies and to get awayfrom a capital deduction,&quot; Mr. Green said. &quot;It was always ourunderstanding that we could do that.&quot; However, the local FDICoffice in San Francisco &quot;presented this as an impermissibleacquisition of assets,&quot; he said. &quot;We maintain we've alwaysowned these assets. Therefore, there's no acquisition, and nochange of risk&quot; to the insurance fund.   Indeed, the executive said, rejecting the liquidationentails more risk to the insurance fund &quot;because it puts ourcapital plan in jeopardy.&quot; He said he continues to hope thatFDIC policy makers in Washington will review the matterfavorably.   Far West calculates its thrift's tangible net worth at$37.7 million as of June 30. But Far West warned that denialof the liquidation plan could result in a tangible capitalvalue on a regulatory basis of negative $23.6 million.Moreover, if certain accounting and tax issues aren'tresolved in Far West's favor, its value could reach anegative $75 million, the company said.   While Far West said it believes its assets and liabilitiesare properly valued, it noted regulatory authorities mayrequire the creation of additional reserves for loans,investments and other contingent liabilities. Such reserves,if required, would be reflected in the company's thirdquarter operating results.</TEXT></DOC>
