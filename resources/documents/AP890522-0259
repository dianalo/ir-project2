But in the telling, playwright Clare Coss has made her storylong, unpleasant, tedious, inconsistent and boring.   Louisa Horton plays a New Orleans woman in a spacious LongIsland old-age home who has periods of confusion, but most of thetime complains loudly that she wants to live with her daughter.   The photographer daughter, played by Anita Gillette, experiencesguilt but realizes she'd have to hire full-time caretakers for hermother. She patiently accepts her mother's abuse during weeklyvisits. The daughter's supportive lawyer roommate-lover, Nan, isplayed by Kelly Bishop, who was the original brash Sheila in ``AChorus Line.''   The playwright has the mother proclaiming aspects of her ownpersonality, some of them news to everybody else on stage. More newpersonality traits for Mom are written into the daughter'sthrobbingly delivered eulogy while her mother is still alive.   This apparently is meant to show the mother as a complex person.But it comes across as the writer throwing in everything she canthink of and creating no person known to humanity.   Three practical nurses often watch TV in the mother's room. BethFowler plays an Irish woman obsessed with the Catholic Church,Leila Boyd a mothering black woman and Olga Merediz a sympatheticHispanic girl. Anne Shropshire plays another old lady in the home,vague but saintly.   The play of seemingly innumerable scenes is directed by RobertaSklar.</TEXT></DOC>
