The request was made in a letter dated June 29 and released at anews conference Tuesday.   One of the signers, Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., said he had seenreports that Bush was considering meeting with F.W. de Klerk, leaderof South Africa's National Party, later this month.   Wolpe is the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommitteeon Africa.   The letter said that ``to meet with the National Party leader andanticipated president of South Africa without any significant changeby the white-minority regime would send a terribly wrong signalconcerning the direction of U.S. policy during the Bushadministration.''   The letter commended Bush for meeting with South AfricanArchbishop Desmond Tutu and other opponents of the racial policiesof the South African government.   As for Bush's meeting with de Klerk, congressmen said theyopposed such a session unless the South African government tookthese steps:   _Releasing all political prisoners jailed because of theiropposition to South Africa's racial policies.   _Ending the state of emergency, extended into its fourth yearJune 9, along with abolishing restrictions on leaders oforganizations outside parliament.   _Removing bans on all political organizations.</TEXT></DOC>
