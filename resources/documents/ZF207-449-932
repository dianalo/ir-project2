(GCC) have a great idea.andP;  They getoverseas shipping containers -- the &quot;piggy-back&quot; things that go from shipsright onto a semi-truck trailer or train flatbed.andP;  They fix 'em up, slap somepaint on them, put racks and air conditioning in them, and presto -- cellularshack.andP;  GCC's in San Francisco.andM;Reincarnation Dream: When Andy is born again, he wants to come back as thecompany with the contract to print all the stuff US West puts out.andM;100 Years Old.andP;  the payphone is 100 years old this year, So, we learn fromLIFE Magazine, is the brassiere.andP;  Coincidence?andM;You'll be hearing a lot about the &quot;new world of payphones&quot; in the generalpress, thanks to work by the &quot;Centennial Pay Phone Committee&quot; and its mainplatform, Public Communications mag.andM;Speaking of Payhones.andP;  Up till now, the common, regulated, telephone-companypayphone hasn't stayed up with the times.andP;  &quot;Management reporting&quot; consistedof sending the guy out to empty the boxes and scribble on a piece of paperhow many quarters he emptied.andP;  (Once, Andy saw a coin-box emptier drop about$10 in change into a New York sidewalk snow drift, and walk away.andP;  &quot;I don'tget my hands cold for this job,&quot; he said.andP;  Andy did.)andM;THE COCOT guys can't afford that crap, so they've insisted on &quot;smart&quot;payphones wiht dial-in reporting.andP;  Guess what?andP;  The telcos can no longerafford it either, so smart phone leader GTE Supply's Public Communicationsdivision (Salt Lake) is offering a smart phone to the telcos.andP;  It's prettymuch the same as their COCOT smarty (except it's line-powered).andP;  Telcos canbuy it three ways: totally dumb, but prepared to be retrofit with the smartparts; partly retrofit, but still not quite smart; and fully ready to go.andM;It'll cost the telcos about $450 per phone.andM;&quot;PBXs are Not Created Equal.&quot;andP;  And that makes life tough for automatedattendants.andP;  Different makers' switches have differing ring cycles, differentbusy patters, different ways of delivering forwarded calls, the works.andM;Automation Electronics' (Dublin, CA) new Max 370 attendant helps.andP;  It's got a&quot;parameter checker&quot; built in.andP;  It reads how the host telephone system doesits thing, and adjusts itself accordingly.andP;  Usually, the tech has tounderstand the switch and manually do the programming.andM;The Max also has a cool graphic management reporting feature that showsactivity on the thing in pie-chart form and in regular tabbed print-out.andM;Suggested list price for a three-port, two-minute system is $5,765.andP;  That'spretty much bottom-line; fully blown runs about $10,000.andM;Palco Telecom, Nashville, refurbishes payphones, mainly.andP;  (They bought GTE'smanufacturing business last year.)andP;  But they also sell business andresidential toll restrictors -- the kind that block certain numbers, likedirty-talk 976 exchanges.andP;  They advertise the product with a really sleazylooking hooker-type, and the words: &quot;She wants to talk to your children.andO;Call Controller won't let her.andM;Do You Have A Bad Ear?andP;  A lot of people hear better out of one ear than theother.andP;  Sometimes, it's just temporary (like an earache, or a do-it-yourselfpierce job).andP;  So why don't headsets (the single-ear kind) let you changewhich ear you listen through?andM;They do now.andP;  Audiosears, Stamford, NY, makes a headset that changes forlefties and righties.andP;  They call it the Satellite.andP;  It also has a goose-neckflexible boom and (get ready for this) comes in seven bright colors?andP;  It'sreally nice.andP;  You could get them for $89.95 each at Supercomm; they'reusually $109.95 for onesie-twosies.andP;  (We really liked the bright blue ones --hing-hint.)andM;Do you know what a SCIF is?andP;  It's one of those great government acronyms.andP;  Ismeans an area that is required to have secured (i.e., bug-free) telephones.andO;It's one of the things government sub-contractors have to do to get US bids.andM;Now regular Joes can have bug-free communications (you still have to notifythe authorities if you install SCIF-type equipment, but it's easier now).andO;Irvine, CA's Sanbar (yep, they're back) is making SCIF 1A2 equipment forbusiness.andP;  Their Secure Line Card (the 4001-201), for instance, makes aphysical metallic break between the CO and your key phone.andP;  (A phone'smouthpiece can be a room bug even when it's on hook.)andM;Super-Patch Panel!andP;  Amp (Harrisburg, PA) has the ultimateeverything-to-everything connector system.andP;  It's based on their new AmpCommunications Outlet.andM;It's basically a universal outlet box, and you buy inserts with the actualterminations...inserts now cover all twisted pair jobs and most coaxconnections.andP;  The real secret are the edge connectors that attach to thewires.andP;  All Amp inserts attach via the same edge connector.andP;  From then on,you mix and match connectors till you're blue.andP;  The idea, of course, is a&quot;vendor-impartial&quot; (their great term) wiring plan, which can be changedforever by simply changing the ends.andM;Gizmos Galore.andP;  We thought Telcor (Hackettstown, NJ) would coast forever ontheir pet-rock-of-the-telecom-business, the Twisstop Cord Untangler.andP;  But no!andM;They have a collection of installation goodies now.andP;  The Easy-Mount Jack iswhat they call an &quot;anchorless drywall surface-mount jack.&quot;andP;  It's neat.andP;  Theygive you a jack, a few weird looking nail/screws and a tool.andP;  The nail/screwspush into the drywall with the tool, at angles.andP;  The jack stays on tight ...andO;we tried one.andP;  You can remove them easily, because the nail/screws have anextra bit at the top for pliers to grab.andP;  And all that's left are four tinyholes a Lyme-disease tick couldn't even hide in.andP;  Telcor sells you a bag of250 jacks, with nail/screws, for $1.48 per jack.andP;  And they throw in a fistfulof tools for -- surprise?andP;  -free.andM;Next is the &quot;Easy-Patch/66.&quot;andP;  These are doodads that turn the punchdownterminals on a 66-block into modular, RJ-11-type connections.andP;  Patch-panelingthen becomes easy, and you can use wiring analyzers with them, too.andP;  Theyhave both four- and six-wire ones.andP;  They're in a kind-of &quot;L&quot; shape, so theyfit both side-by-side and back-to-back.andP;  Twenty connectors cost a dealerabout $45 bucks, so intended ones will pay around $80.andM;And finally, the &quot;easy-Cart.&quot;andP;  Wish we had a pciture.andP;  It's a chrome rod witha handle on one end and wheels on the bottom.andP;  You slide wire spools over therod, put the handle on, ans wheel four (or six -- it's modular!) spools up tothe job.andP;  Get on the elevator -- no problem, it stands upright like a Hooverat rest.andP;  Get to the job, lay it down, and unreel the wire like a gardenhose.andP;  Ge finished, and it breaks down to fit in the truck.andP;  We love it.andP;  Buyfour and you'll pay $62 each.andM;Cordless Headset.andP;  It was beautiful under-glass when we saw it at Supercomm.andO;It's a complete cordless telephone/headset/FM radio called the Walk-n-Talk byWicom, Canoga Park, CA.andP;  There you are, trying to remember the trade show youwere at last week, listening to George Jones on the radio through theheadphones.andP;  You get a call.andP;  Ordinarily, you jerk the headphones off, throwthem on the desk, pick up the receiver, answer the call just when the partyhas hung up.andM;Uh-uh.andP;  Now you hit a button on the belt pack.andP;  George stops in mid-sob andyou got your call.andP;  Finish your call, and you're back on the air in time forReba.andP;  The Walk-n-Talk is available mid-July, and costs about $229.andM;Siemens' Talk Show.andP;  Oprah, eat your heart out.andP;  Siemens sponsored a sort oftalk show/instant opinion poll at Supercomm.andP;  Arthur Miller -- the guy whohosts those ethics debates on PBS -- asked the questions, and the audiencevoted for their answers with little push-button devices.andP;  The questions weretypical future-of-interexchange-in-the-brave-new-world, etc., etc.andM;Most interesting statistic, we think?andP;  57% of the voters (nearly alltelephone company-types) believed entertainment -- cable TV, especially --will drive the pusch for broadband services.andP;  A measly 28% thoughtwork-at-home would be the impetus for phone companies to offer switchedbroadband services.andP;  As Kent Foster, GTE Tel-Ops president pointed correctlyout: &quot;People pay a lot more for cable TV than they do for telephone service.&quot;andM;Our sich for your children: that they all be CATV operators when the phonecompanies go coax shopping.andM;My Favorite Things.andP;  We know.andP;  TELCONNECT is goofy.andP;  But we can't help it.andO;Our absolute favorite products at Suprcomm were the Line Mark Flags bySmi-Carr, Odessa, TX.andP;  Their simplicity is almost divine.andP;  These arecolor-coded strands of some kind of tough plastic, bound by a steel clip witha point on the bottom.andP;  Pound stakes in the ground along the path of a buriedline of some kind, and attach the Line Mark flags to the stakes.andP;  You can runover them, fall on them, kick dirt at them, taunt them with names ...andP;  butthey spring back for more.andM;They're cheap, simple and they work.andP;  And they're kinda pretty.andP;  Top marksfrom us.andP;  $103.95 for 1,000, packed one color per box.andP;  They'll mix colorsfor an additional $2.50 per thou.andM;Dumb Luck.andP;  Our faces are red.andP;  We unconsciously (we're frequentlyunconscious) tossed a business card into Newbridge Networks', Herndon, VA,drawing for a &quot;1082 MainStreet&quot; data controller, with software.andP;  Much to oursheer embarrassment, Peter Madsen drew our name.andM;Now, we begged they give it to a customer instead.andP;  But they played by therules, and insisted we keep it.andP;  So, here's our solution: write 350 words tous, explaining &quot;Why I Should Have Won The MainStreet Data Controller Insteadof TELECONNECT.&quot;andP;  Convince us, and we'll give it to you.andP;  At least you'lldeserve it.andM;Unlike Newbridge, we have no plans to be objective.andP;  The winner will be up toour utter discretion, all decisions will final and arbitrary.andP;  But we willgive the winner the prize, and publish the winning answer in an upcomingissue.andM;Send entries to &quot;Andy Moore, refaced guy, c/o TELECONNECT, 12 West 21 Street,New York, NY 10010.&quot;andP;  As usual, netness counts.andM;By the way, the 1082 connects eight RS-232-type devices (computers, modems)and two parallel devices (like printers) into a very easy to use LAN-typething.andP;  It's for sharing those devices in a small office or department.andM;ALARMing.andP;  Keptel, Tinton Falls, NJ, has an alarming product.andP;  It's calledGOLD System -- Guaranteed Open Loop Detection.andP;  It's basically an alarm thatmonitors up to 950 lines and screams like hell when one gets interrupted.andO;Actually, it doesn't scream exactly.andP;  It just calls as many as eightdifferent &quot;things&quot; -- terminals or dumb printers -- and spits out a report.andO;The idea for the phone companies is to offer &quot;alarm monitoring&quot; as avalue-added service to special circuit customers, like banks.andP;  But end userscan use it for their dedicated modem lines, etc.andM;Short Haul LAN.andP;  We learned this about LANs over microwave hops: the firstradios used the same Ethernet protocol for passing data through the air asEthernet passes data through wire.andP;  But Ethernet is one-way; microwave isduplex.andP;  So when data packets passed in the air, the Ethernet softwareassumed it was one packet, which had collided and returned forre-transmission.andP;  That's how Ethernet works.andP;  So at the usual distance formicrowave -- 10 or so miles -- the packets were passing and beingunnecessarily re-transmitted like a bandit.andM;So, that's why LAN microwave links have been kept short -- four or fivemiles.andP;  So that packets could make it all the way across without passinganother one en route.andP;  That's the only reason.andM;Microwave Networks Houston, TX, solves this problem by &quot;teaching&quot; Ethernet anew protocol for going through the air.andP;  That's as technical as we want toget here.andP;  The result: Microwave Networks' LANs can work up to a reported 20miles per link (they don't say, but that's probably the 15 GHz radio; we'repretty sure the 23 gig radio links would be shorter).andM;The other thing microwave LANs need is security.andP;  You know and I know thatmicrowave is hard to steal, but when precious data in involved, people willpay for security.andP;  So, Microwave Networks now offer encryption in theirradios (that was new at Supercomm.)andM;How'd they find out?andP;  Did you know that if you stick a straight pin throughthe armored cord of a payphone handset just right, you can keep the coinsfrom being returned (until you pull the pin out, then it's like a slotmachine)?andP;  And if you poke one through a mouthpiece hole just right, you canget free calls?andP;  Well, you can't anymore, 'cause Audiosears fixed thoseproblems for the payphone makers.andP;  They love doing that customized stuff.andO;They're a good group of people and have been around for-absolute-ever.andM;The Cutting Edge of Distribution.andP;  Alltel/Texocom is hawking a slew of newproducts.andP;  They include ATandamp;T's new two-pair fiberglass reinforced drop wire,Audichron's multichannel digital voice announcer and Datapoint's desktopvideo conferencing system.andP;  In addition, Alltel/Texocom and Mitel haveannounced a new sales promotion program to encourage sales of the Mitel line.andO;It's called &quot;The switch to paradise.&quot;andM;Elcotel's Automated Operator Functions.andP;  Elcotel has a new automated operatorfunction for payphones.andP;  This system provides message store and forward,calling-card number validation and automatic billing-data collection onpayphones.andP;  This system doesn't restrict choices on billing, collection andvalidation agents.andM;Some Supercomm '89 Statistics.andP;  Supercomm had over 15,000 attendees thisyear.andP;  Almost 4,000 attended on the morning of the keynote address alone.andM;There were over 400 exhibitors manned by about 5,000 worker bees.andM;It was sunny and 75 degrees for the entire show.andM;Last year, Supercomm had about 12,000 attendees.andM;Another Fine Fiber Distribution Frame.andP;  ADC (Minneapolis, MN) introduced anew Fiber Distribution Frame at Supercomm.andP;  This piece of hardware provides acentralized point for cross-connecting, splicing and storing optical fiber.andO;ADC emphasized modularity and flexibility in designing the frame, enabling itto grow from one fiber to thousands of fibers without sacrificing space orfunction.andM;Secretary Show.andP;  Ed and Maddy went to the New York Secretary Show (which alsohas Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago incarnations) to see if they had anyinnovative office products that will make all our lives easier.andM;They found out something very important.andP;  Secretaries dress better thanwriters.andP;  Every secretary at the show was dressed in an executive-perfectsuit and blouse.andP;  Maybe they all saw Working Girl.andM;The most interesting product at the show was the Safe Monitor from SafeComputing (Needham, MA).andP;  The Safe Monitor is a radiation-free computermonitor (or VDT).andM;Citing studies linking radiation from computer monitors to miscarriages, SafeComputing says the Safe Monitor protects pregnant employees and theirdeveloping fetuses from possible radiation while protecting employers frombirth-defect related lawsuits.andM;An award for creative marketing for an office supply company should go toPerforming Artists Diversified (New York, NY).andP;  Why should you buy from them?andO;Because by doing so &quot;you will be supporting the arts and helping an artistearn a dignified living while still pursuing his (sic) artistic goals.&quot;andM;For your altruism you get (in addition to your supplies, we assume) a thankyou sung in four-part harmony.andM;At the NYNEX booth they had something that looked like a high-tech pillow.andO;Finally, something to ease the pain of breakfast meetings!andP;  But no, it turnedout to be NEC's VoicePoint teleconference transceiver.andM;It features full duplex transmission, volume control, howling control (forfeedback squeals) and a microphone-off switch for private conversations.andP;  Andif things get boring, it still looks comfortable enough to double as apillow.andM;A New Voice Multiplex from PCSI.andP;  PCSI (San Diego, CA) unveiled its ClaritySeries 4100 Voice Multiplexer.andP;  Using proprietary voice compressionalgorithms, this machine offers great voice quality, transparency to analogmodem signals and an ability to network through corporate PBXs withoutdegrading voice signals or adding delays.andM;We were told that prices for the CS4100 are starting at $8,000.andP;  This macineis just right for 56 and 64 Kbps digital links.andP;  By combining up to fourvoice channels and a data channel over a single high-speed digital circuit,the CS4100 provides rapid paybacks on circuits as short as 50 miles.andM;PCSI will service its customers through a direct sales and seviceorganization with offices in Dallas and San Diego.andP;  There are also authorizedregional reps and national value added distributors.andM;Fujitsu's New Digital Cross-Connect System.andP;  Fujitsu showed off their new DAX3/1 digital automatic cross-connect system at Supercomm.andP;  The DAX providesefficient routing of CO T-1 traffic.andP;  The real-time, alternative-routetraffic restoral capacity of the DAX minimizes losses caused by catastrophicfailures.andM;The Chameleon Changes Its Spots.andP;  Tekelec was showing off the Chameleon8000's field-test system's new ZBTSI capability.andP;  This option provides accessto DS-0 channels on systems using ZBTSI so users can monitor or simulateZ-bit errors in the transmitted signal for thorough testing.andM;The ZBTSI is currently listed at $1,900.andM;Birth of the Solstar System.andP;  Sun Moon Star (San Jose, CA) showed off theirnew Solstar DKTS digital key systems at the show.andP;  These are available forimmediate delivery.andM;The Solstar is for the small business end user.andP;  It can be configured viamultiple default databases or can be customized to meet station-user needsvia user programmable keys.andP;  It can be operated with a PBX or as a standalonesystem.andP;  Features include auto-route selection, speakerphone capability onall sets, softkeys and off-premise call forwarding.andM;Shutout of the Magic Kingdom.andP;  When Nikita Khrushchev came to the US and tookoff his shoe to bang home his point that the Communist World would bury thedecrepit west, he, nonetheless, made sure he got to visit Disneyland.andM;Conventioneers were not so fortunate.andP;  Since the Magis Kingdom closes at 7 PMSunday through Thursday, there was just no time, no time.andP;  It seems thatDisneyland is committed to an kinder, gentler America where people go to bedearly.andM;Macrotel's 80D Digital Hybrid Key System.andP;  This hybrid key system wasintroduced at Supercomm as the perfect niche system for the sophisticatedusers, like attorneys and others with particularly heavy traffic.andM;The 80D has a minimum of four stations and has 120 nonblocking channels.andP;  Afew of the many system features include alphanumeric display, answerselection, auto attendant, calling number display, call splitting, DID, musicon hold, station busy field and trunk busy field.andP;  Station features includelast number redial, off-hook voice announce, group pick-up and speed dialing.andM;Telrad's Virtuoso ISDN Demonstration.andP;  Telrad (Woodbury, NY) had a big crowdaround their booth on the first day of the show.andP;  Onlookers were introducedto a new &quot;Version 2 Plus&quot; software and a SpeakEasy voice mail/automatedattendant system for Telrad's Key Bx hybrid key system.andM;The SpeakEasy will also work with Telrad's Symphony Digital Hybrid PBX.andP;  TheSpeakEasy is a PC-based, menudriven system that is fully integrated into therespective key system.andM;The SpeakEasy Automated Attendant provides incoming callers with instructionsfor calling extensions, for recording messages and for playing back messagesfrom individual extensions.andP;  Assigned users have mailboxes in which they mayrecord reminders and messages for or from callers.andM;But as neat as the SpeakEasy is, the real crowd pleaser at Telrad's show wasthe IDS-287 fully featured voice/data terminal for use with a basic rateinterface (2B + D).andP;  That's ISDN!andM;The lovely Angela Mastandrea directed us to a demonstration of this setupwhich, among other things, allowed two remote users to interact on the sameWordStar document.andM;The IDS is available in four ISDN compatible configurations:andM;* IDS 287/V.andP;  This uses the B-channel for voice features.andM;* IDS 287/P.andP;  This terminal uses the B-channel for voice features and theD-channel for asynchronous packet-switched data.andM;* IDS-287/D-1.andP;  This uses both the B and D channels of the basic rateinterface.andP;  Through a single RS-232 connector, the user can designate thedata path as the D-channel (packet capability), or the B-channel (circuitswitched).andP;  The designation can be made on a per call or &quot;until changed&quot;basis.andM;* IDS-287/D-2.andP;  This uses the full 2B + D capability of the basic rateinterface.andP;  B-channel voice, B-channel circuit switched data and D-channelpacket-switched data.andM;Science Dynamics' New VRS.andP;  Science Dynamics (Cherry Hill, NJ) introduced anew Voice Response System that is an automatic intercept product, providingflexible announcement capabilities for the CO environment.andM;The VRS is available in a wide range of interface configurations toaccommodate any size switching facility.andP;  It contains a PROM-based speechlibrary that consists of standard phrases used to build messages.andP;  The systemsupports up to 1,000 messages consisting of 500 factor recorded messages, 300user messages and 200 user-recorded messages.andM;The VRS starts at about $3,000 for the smallest setup and can rise withmodular expansion to as much as $160,000.andP;  This product has a wealth ofapplications, including auto changed-number referral, 800-service referral,vacant-code announcements and information-providing services.andM;The folks from Macrotel's headquarters in Ft.andP;  Lauderdale, FL, told us thatthe 80D is ready for immediate delivery.andP;  So give 'em a call.andP;  The 80D may bethe key to your communication needs.andM;Faster than a Bolt of Lightning.andP;  GTE announded two solid state replacementsurge arrestors, the SS7B/SS8B, for use at the customer's premise.andP;  These arefor use in 1/2-20 and 7/16-20 protector wells.andM;Unlike spark-gap devices, these solid state elements are capable of reactingquickly enough to stop the energy of lightning-fast surges.andP;  The maximum peakvoltage allowed by the SS7B/SS8B replacement surge arrestors is 425 voltswith a rise time of up to 10kV per microsecond.andM;Everyone got Lei-ed at GTE's elegant, Hawaii-style poolside gathering.andO;Congratulations to Jan Doutre, the world's best hospitality giver, and CarolMorrisson, a nifty dancer.andP;  And it's great to see &quot;Uncle&quot; Al Lindholm,looking better than ever after a brief illness.andM;New Test and Monitoring Sets from 3M Dynatel.andP;  3M showed a slew of new testand monitoring sets at the show.andP;  Like the brand-new 965 loop analyzer.andP;  Thisperforms tests that previously required from three to seven separate testinstruments.andP;  It's compact, lightweight and uses combinations of voltages andohms measurements and automatic fault detection methods to zero.andP;  It's asolution to complex cable problems.andM;Dynatel's new VenCAT 3100 DS-3 performance monitoring system allowscontinuous, real-time peformance monitoring of up to 36 DS-3 paths per shelf.andO;This unit does all this using standard M13 framing formats.andM;Intense Switch: Supercomm '89 had an abundance of switching and CO-relatedequipment.andP;  TELECONNECT doesn't generally dwell on such things.andP;  But we werestopped in our tracks by Hekimian's new electronic digital signalcross-connect DS-1 switch, the T::DAX.andM;T::DAX stands for &quot;transparent digital access and cross-connect system.&quot;andO;This product provides remote provisioning, automatic network reconfiguration,full-time performance monitoring and automated test access.andM;This switch also becomes an ideal vehicle for grooming and  managing DS-3capacity (you just have to add a modular M13 shelf which features 1:8protection and DS-3/1 performance monitoring).andM;Trial runs are still being conducted on this product.andP;  But the folks atHekimian's headquarters in Gaithersburg, MD, tell us that it will be marketedin the near future.andM;At this time, three models are planned: a single seven-foot bay with two to448 ports, a two-bay unit containing up to 1,120 ports and a three-bayversion containing up to 1,792 ports.andP;  Equivalent DS-3 ports can besubstituted for DS-1 ports on a shelf-by-shelf basis.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
