Wood, an economist at Bank of America, San Francisco. &quot;And there is ample evidence to believe they are, which is why support in the bond market suddenly collapsed. We are so dependent on foreigners to finance our deficits that if the Japanese raise their rates, ours will have to rise as well just to maintain an attractive differential,&quot; Mr. Wood said.    The Treasury declined to comment on the report that the Bank of Japan is tightening monetary policy. Prices of actively traded 30-year government bonds fell more than 1 1/4 points yesterday, or over $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury issue climbed to 9.69%, matching the highest level for this year, which also was the highest since mid-December 1985, according to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Many corporate and municipal securities also slumped. At the Chicago Board of Trade, where traders reported a late afternoon wave of sell orders from customers, Treasury bonds for delivery in December settled more than a point lower.    Earlier this week, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita indicated at a meeting of insurance company executives that the central bank is shifting its credit stance amid signs of rising inflation. Yesterday, a news service of Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc. cited government officials saying they planned to limit the growth of commercial bank lending and allow short-term interest rates to move higher.    The news report -- which appeared as several long-term credit banks agreed to raise their long-term prime rates 0.5 percentage point to 5.7% effective Oct. 1 -- also said Mr. Sumita plans to explain the tighter monetary policy to officials of the so-called Group of Seven industrial countries at a weekend meeting. The report was neither confirmed nor denied by Japanese officials, although it was taken very seriously in the foreign exchange and credit markets.    &quot;It had immediate impact and spread through the market like wildfire,&quot; said John Harangody, a vice president in the institutional financial futures division at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;The sell orders just came in droves&quot; in the bond futures trading ring at the Board of Trade. &quot;It may turn out to be one of the busiest days in some time,&quot; he said.    Early in the day, speculation that President Reagan might veto the revamped Gramm-Rudman law with the new debt ceiling &quot;started the market off with a bad tone,&quot; said James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.    The slump deepened in the afternoon because of the report that Japanese interest rates will rise further. &quot;The market was on the defensive all day,&quot; Mr. Capra said.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 15.24 points to 1177.06. That was only slightly above its low for the day of 1176.32. The high for the day was 1189.29.    Among actively traded issues, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 92 1/32 from 93 3/8 Wednesday, as the yield rose to 9.69% from 9.55%. The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 declined to 94 5/32 from 95 4/32, while the yield increased to 9.55% from 9.39%.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills were mixed. The rate on the Treasury's latest three-month bills declined to 6.42% bid from 6.50% Wednesday, while the latest six-month bill rate rose to 6.80% bid from 6.76%.    The federal funds funds rate averaged 7.35% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was down from an average of about 7 3/4% Wednesday, but it was higher than the daily average of about 7 1/4% in the week ended Wednesday. The funds rate is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight.    In the new issue market, Salomon Brothers said sales were very brisk for the previously reported $2.38 billion issue of rural housing senior mortgage pass-through certificates backed by Farmers Home Administration rural housing loans. &quot;It was very successful, very well-received,&quot; a Salomon Brothers spokesman said.    The issue was divided into four CMOs, or collateralized mortgage obligations. Yields ranged from 8.63% on securities with a weighted average life of 3.44 years to 10.97% on securities with a weighted average life of 20.15 years, according to Salomon.    The 8.63% yield was 0.01 percentage point below the yield on comparable Treasury issues at the time the offering was priced Wednesday morning, a Salomon spokesman said. And the 10.97% yield was 1.4 percentage points over comparable Treasurys at the time of pricing.    The issue was offered with outside insurance. It received triple-A ratings from both Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc. The insurance comes from the American Loan Guarantee Association, a group of insurers.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, a $475 million issue of Supermarkets General Holdings Corp. notes, due in 1997, was offered. The 14 1/2% senior subordinated notes were priced at par, according to Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The issue was rated single-B-2 by Moody's and single-B-minus by Sandamp;P.    Supermarkets General Holdings is a newly formed company organized at the direction of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc., a subsidiary of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., to acquire Supermarkets General Corp. Net proceeds from the note sale will be used to repay a short-term bridge loan made to Supermarkets General Holdings by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., to finance part of the acquisition. The rest of the proceeds will be used for working capital as well as fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction.    Separately, an issue of about $231.6 million of Big Rivers Electric Corp. cooperative utility trust certificates due in 30 years was priced yesterday by underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. The 10.7% certificates were priced at par. The issue, which is noncallable for 10 years, was priced 1.1 percentage points above the rate on comparable Treasury bonds. </TEXT></DOC>
