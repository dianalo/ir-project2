Earnings for the period, ended May 31, rose 51% to $47.8 million, or 56 cents a share, on a 1.3% sales rise to $1.55 billion. A year earlier, the company reported earnings of $31.6 million, or 37 cents a share, after restructuring charges of $21.6 million, or 25 cents a share. Sales in the year-earlier period were $1.53 billion.    For the year, the company reported earnings dropped 62% to $69.3 million, or 81 cents a share, compared with $181.9 million, or $2.10 a share, for fiscal 1987. Revenue rose slightly to $6.19 billion from $6.13 billion. The net earnings were the lowest for Pillsbury in 10 years and led to a management shakeout.    As previously reported, Pillsbury took restructuring charges of $140.9 million, equal to $1.64 a share, in its third quarter as part of what the interim chairman, William H. Spoor, yesterday described as &quot;a clear-the-deck effort.&quot; Charges covered the sale of the Godfather's Pizza, Quik Wok, Bay Street and Key West Grill restaurant chains, disposal of 30 Steak andamp; Ale and Bennigan's restaurants, a write-down of Burger King assets, consolidation of several food plants and dismissal of about 200 headquarters employees. For fiscal 1987, Pillsbury had net restructuring charges of $11.9 million, or 14 cents a share.    Without the charges Pillsbury said it would have posted a record year. Its consumer foods group reported a 5.8% sales gain, to $3.56 billion, and pre-charge earnings of $280.5 million, a 6% increase. But for the fourth quarter, operating profit declined 2% to $51.2 million, largely because of continued weakness in frozen pizza and seafood and hefty introductory costs for a line of Green Giant frozen vegetable products.    Restaurant sales for the year declined 5% to $2.63 billion, as each of the core units reported lower average sales. Operating profit slipped 8% to $217.2 million. Fourth-quarter sales dropped 8% to $649 million while operating earnings fell 10% to $65 million. Earnings at Steak andamp; Ale and Bennigan's units were down sharply, the company said.    Pillsbury's problems led to the resignations of its former chairman and chief executive officer, John M. Stafford; of the restaurant group's chief executive, J. Jeffrey Campbell; of Steak andamp; Ale and Bennigan's chairman, Kyle T. Craig; and to a management shakeup at the consumer foods group. </TEXT></DOC>
