Trucking, telecommunications,railroads, airlines, banking, financial services - all have survivedthe stresses and challenges of deregulation. Even firms not directlyregulated by federal or state governments have felt the tugs of the trendtoward deregulation. The relaxation of trade barriers, for instance,has incited increased competition in the automobile industry. Some companieshave not survived: Braniff capsized, Pan Am and Eastern are bailing ferventlyto avoid being swamped, and many small banks and trucking companies havegone under. Despite the casualties, deregulation has worked. For themost part, prices have fallen and service has improved. Yet policymakersmust be cautious about using these deregulated industries as models forthe natural gas industry. Unlike the other industries, the natural gasindustry cannot be completely deregulated, in part because pipelinestend to be natural monopolies. Policymakers must achieve a level of deregulationthat optimally balances costs and benefits - no easy task. Although thereis no blanket prescription for formulating policy, there are some guidelines.First, policymakers must understand that natural gas firms will evolveas they adjust to a newly competitive world. Second, they must evaluatemarket demands and anticipate how firms will develop in response to them.Third, they must formulate a sector-sensitive regulatory strategy. Separatepolicies for industrial and residential user must be set in a way thatleaves pipelines and LDCs with incentives to serve both markets. Theseguidelines are not definitive, but they underscore the need for deregulatorypolicies that respond sympathetically to the needs and realities of thediverse, differentiating, and newly competitive natural gas industry.</TEXT></DOC>
