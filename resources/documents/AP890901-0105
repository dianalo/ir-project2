(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Behind the slogans and politicalmaneuvers highlighting ethnic tension in Soviet republics is thehurt and confusion of transplanted Russians who fear being uprootedfrom their homes.   As colonizers, exiles, scientific and economic specialists,Russians have been settling in Moldavia, the Baltics, and othernon-Russian areas for more than 100 years _ both before and afterthe Bolshevik Revolution.   In a period of heightened ethnic feelings as the Soviet Union'sminorities review what decades of Soviet rule have brought, much ofthe anger and frustration is directed at the Russians next door.   Many of them never learned the local language because it neverhas been much of an issue in a land dominated by Moscow. But in asociety that is becoming rapidly polarized by demands for greaterlocal sovereignty, language has become the first and greatestindicator of who is who.   ``Today it's a law on language, tomorrow on citizenship and theday after on residency,'' Russian-language teacher Raisa Kochetovacomplained to the Moldavian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, as itbegan its debate Tuesday on a law making Moldavian the officiallanguage of the republic.   Moldavia on Thursday joined other republics that have passedlanguage laws. The Baltics have followed with legislation restoringnational flags, economic and political sovereignty, and immigrationrestrictions. Estonia went the furthest by setting strict residencyrequirements for voting and running for office.   No nationalist group has called for Russians and others to bethrown out of their republics. In Latvia, the independence movementis taking applications from ethnic Latvians, Russians, and everyoneelse for citizenship in an independent republic.   But the immigrants are worried that some slogans of ethnicprotesters demanding they leave will become the policy of powerfulnew political movements.   ``We read stories about apartheid in South Africa, where peopleare barred from any work except manual labor if their skin is thewrong color,'' said Pyotr Zalozhnikov, 45, a Russian worker andmember of a strike committee in the Moldavian city of Tiraspol.   ``This is what this law would do to all people here who are notMoldavian. In one day we'll be made deaf-mutes. Our children willhave no future,'' he said by telephone.   Non-Moldavian workers are feeling the same pressures asnon-Estonians did in that Baltic republic. They reacted the sameway, by walking off their jobs.   In both republics, the proportion of Russians and non-nativepopulation is less than 40 percent.   Zalozhnikov echoed the concern for his children expressed byNikolai Chugunov, a 42-year-old Russian who has lived in Estonia for33 years. Although he was not affected by the residency requirementsapproved by the Estonian government, he said he was worried aboutwhat steps officials would take next.   Mihai Ghimpu, one of the top officials in the Moldavian People'sFront, said a language law would change mean nothing for the averageworker. ``For workers, life won't change at all,'' he said in aninterview.   But partly to demonstrate the view that their lands were taken byforce and partly to preserve the language and culture from theencroachment of Russian, ethnic leaders insist their language mustbe the official one.   The republics' painful history of incorporation into the SovietUnion makes many people regard the Slavic population with suspicion.   When hundreds of thousands of Estonians, Lithuanians, Latviansand Moldavians were shot or deported as Stalin extended his controlover their lands in the 1940s, they were replaced by Slavs who thedictator regarded as more reliable.   Ethnic activists argue that the immigration has continued sincethen, either as a predetermined policy to weaken the localpopulation, or to take advantage of better living conditions on theSoviet Union's western frontier.   But many go back much further.   In the early 19th century, the great Russian poet AlexanderPushkin was exiled to Kishinev, in what was then the Russianterritory of Bessarabia.   In 1903, Pyotr Shornikov's grandfather, a factory worker, wasexiled to Moldavia for participating in a strike. He stayed therewhen Moldavia became part of Romania after World War I.   Shornikov has lived in Moldavia all his life, became anhistorian, and says he speaks fluent Moldavian. A Russian, he is oneof the leaders of the group Yedinstvo, which is fighting for therights of non-Moldavians.   He rejects the argument that Moldavia is being inundated with anew wave of immigrants. Kishinev, the capital, was about 47 percentethnic Moldavian in the years 1850-90, compared with the 43 percentMoldavian population now, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
