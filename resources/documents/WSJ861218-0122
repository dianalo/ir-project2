Woolworth Co. got to have its cake and eat it too.    The company was expecting a payment in West German marks -- a dividend from a subsidiary. Woolworth expected the mark to strengthen, so it didn't want to lock in the current exchange rate and lose its chance to profit.    On the other hand, says Peter Brown, director of corporate finance, &quot;Our philosophy is to protect our investment first.&quot; If the mark dropped in value, the company didn't want to get hurt.    Woolworth turned to Salomon Brothers Inc., which was selling something it calls a &quot;range forward contract.&quot; The contract, similar to products offered by some other banks and investment concerns, &quot;protected our exposure and allowed us to participate, to a certain extent, in the strength of the mark,&quot; Mr. Brown says.    Basically, the contract set a range of exchange rates, with the bottom of the range being the exchange rate that was in effect when the dividend was declared. If, when the dividend was paid, the mark was below that level, Salomon would make up the difference. If it was above the top of the range, Salomon would collect the excess profit.    As it turned out, the mark appreciated, and Woolworth ultimately got almost double the foreign-exchange gain it would have received if it had locked in the rate when the dividend was declared.    Salomon's success with Woolworth was just one example of an increasingly common phenomenon among major corporations: banks and investment banks pulling once-reluctant corporate treasurers into the options and futures markets by offering them custom-tailored instruments.    In something of a marketing triumph, products with catchy names such as &quot;windows&quot; or &quot;min-max&quot; -- as well as duller ones, such as range forward contract -- are getting treasurers to try what's really an old-fashioned technique -- hedging their interest-rate and currency risks.    Originally, most bankers expected to act as brokers for clients doing their own hedging. But hedging is a complex problem for a corporation. Woolworth could have given itself the same protection by buying puts and selling calls. But the company would have had to monitor those hedges and deal with the attendant accounting problems. The whole process can be complicated and confusing, and boards of directors often call it speculation.    So instead of trying to drag reluctant clients to the market, bankers are bringing the market to their clients, in the form of rate-protection products. With one phone call, a company treasurer can get his interest or exchange rate capped, floored or collared, either now or in the future, at whatever level he's willing to pay for.    &quot;Everybody reacts negatively to complexity,&quot; says Robert Platt, a managing director at Morgan Stanley Group Inc. &quot;We provide a mechanism where we take the burden of understanding the design of the instrument.&quot;    Essentially, all the products operate the same way: Bankers provide some kind of assurance regarding the benchmark rate the company is interested in. (The banks' guarantees apply to market rates, not the company's own transaction costs.) They may guarantee a specific rate or a range of rates, or they may promise to make up the difference if the rate rises above or falls below a particular point.    Corporate issuers not only can buy various types of interest-rate protection; they also can profit from selling options they don't want. In recent months, the market has seen several such offerings. The Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, for instance, offered floating-rate notes whose interest rate rose as market rates dropped. Others offered notes with rates that rose twice as fast as market rates. Still others had returns tied to the relationship between the Japanese yen, or some other currency, and the dollar.    Those issuers weren't betting their companies on interest-rate or currency movements. In each case, the investment banker packaged the &quot;exotic&quot; portion of the offering and sold it to other buyers. The issuer ended up with a traditional financing whose cost was cut -- in Sallie Mae's case by almost half a percentage point -- by the profit from the sale of the so-called embedded option.    Investment bankers now argue that most clients shouldn't even try to use hedges themselves. &quot;If you go out to see a client and there's no Telerate machine in sight, you shouldn't talk about futures,&quot; says Benjamin Wolkowitz, a Morgan Stanley vice president. &quot;If he can afford to be away from the market, he shouldn't be in futures.&quot;    Some of the more complex hedges have to be checked every half-hour or so to make sure the market hasn't moved away from them. &quot;For a corporation to set up a whole system with only one product moving only one way through the channels doesn't generally make sense,&quot; says Edson V. Mitchell, a managing director at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    The new products spring from the increasing availability and sophistication of hedging techniques combined with a degree of market volatility that has made financing a risky business for issuers. &quot;We find many financing decisions to go or not go are being made at the most senior level, with the chief executive officer involved,&quot; says Michael Quinn, head of Merrill Lynch's debt transaction desk. &quot;A lot of them have turned into market-timers.&quot;    Bankers are cagey about how they protect themselves from the risks they're so eagerly taking off their clients' backs. But they've got a lot of choices. An interest-rate cap, for instance, can be sold as is, if there's a buyer; or it can be hedged in the options or futures market or through an interest-rate swap. &quot;The pricing of the product,&quot; says Merrill's Mr. Quinn, &quot;is driven off the various ways we can unwind it.&quot;    Investment bankers try to lay off the risk as quickly as they can. That has provided an opening for banks eager to gain clients. They can use the expertise they've gained in hedging their own huge currency and money-market operations to act as principals on interest-rate guarantees.    Chemical New York Corp.'s Chemical Bank landed the lead manager role on one $200 million Eurobond issue largely because it was willing to act as principal on a hedge that was involved.    &quot;We were able to make an instant decision to book, position and hedge it,&quot; says David M. Gelber, an executive director of Chemical Bank International Ltd. &quot;It definitely helped us to achieve the corporate finance business.&quot;    The competition between banks and investment bankers gives issuers one big benefit: lower costs. In many cases -- Woolworth's among them -- the products are free; the bankers make money by trading the options and through efficiencies of scale in their own hedging operations. And companies can shop widely for the best terms. Even when there is a fee, it poses much less of an accounting problem than, for instance, the purchase of a futures contract.    So far, only the most sophisticated issuers have made much use of these techniques. But most bankers expect them to spread.    &quot;The genie is out of the bottle,&quot; says Merrill's Mr. Mitchell. &quot;Unless you think there will be re-regulation and corporate finance will become less sophisticated and the market less volatile, this is here to stay.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
