Italiansdemonstrated to the Department of Agriculture that the air-cured,raw ham is not hazardous to your health.   Parma had long exported its famous Parmesan cheese, along withthe opera music of its native Giuseppe Verdi and its conductorArturo Toscanini. But its light pink, tender, sweet-tastingprosciutti were kept out in 1967, when swine fever swept Italy.   Fearing foot-and-mouth disease and hog cholera, the U.S.government closed its borders. Americans had to make do with Swissham from Tessin or imitations from Pennsylvania or Connecticut.   ``But,'' claims Giorgio Orlandini, ``no one could ever match thecuring by sweet and foggy air drifting through pine, olive andchestnut forests and the tradition of pork pummelers massaging hogshoulders into tenderness for at least a year before they reach thestore.''   Orlandini, director of the Industrial Union of Parma, helped leadthe battle to get prosciutto back to the United States.   Only pigs bred in a special area on a combination of Parmesancurds and other feed _ but not slop _ can be candidates forprosciutto. They must reach 330 pounds at the end of a year beforegoing to registered slaughterhouses.   After hardening for 24 hours in deep freeze, hog shoulders arepared of fat, salted, seasoned and frozen for another month.   The hams emerge to the kneading bench for the first of manymassages to squeeze out the salty juice and tenderize the meat.   They are kept at least 400 days in ventilated storage halls thatcontain slats opened from time to time at night to allow thebalsamic air to waft through the hanging hams.   Finally, the hams are scrubbed with warm water, sandpapered to anattractive finish and kept in a moist chamber until selling time.   At almost every stage, the ham massager gives them another quickrubdown. Inadequate hams are eliminated, with the 214 members of theprosciutto ham corsortium able to take a tax deduction.   The Parma ham symbol _ a ducal crown with five points _ burntinto the prosciutto and a specially stamped metal joint guarantee itis the real thing.   Parma produces over 8 million prosciutti a year, about half ofItaly's total raw ham production.   Processors say the long seasoning destroys all potentiallypresent microorganisms and should trim the ham to nearly half itsoriginal weight, but no less than 15.4 pounds.   Stung by the U.S. ban, the consortium fought to prove that swineflu had been licked and that the slaughtering, seasoning andpummeling were as hygienic as in America.   A veterinarian from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service was sent to visit the 21companies accredited for export to the United States. Changes weremade _ but five-century-old traditions remained, such as ceremonialham-by-ham ``smelling.''   An expert still inserts a thin bone from a horse's tibia todiscern if the aroma in the processing is just right.   ``Finally, the innocence of prosciutto has emerged,'' says FrancoScatozza, dean emeritus of veterinarian medicine at the Universityof Parma.   ``It would be absurd to suspect that if the animals suffered aninfection, these organisms would survive a long period of processingand seasoning. And these illnesses would not be contagious forhumans.''   Scatozza said the U.S. government finally was persuaded, aftergovernment-supervised experiments on both sides of the Atlantic,that the long curing of the ham triggers self-sterilization andeliminates any viruses.   On April 8, 1987, the news spread through this gastronomiccapital of Italy: the U.S. Department of Agriculture had lifted theban.   After clearance procedures, the go-ahead was flashed forshipments to America this month.   The thin, silky slices of ham retail in Italy for about $15 apound. The price should hover around $20 a pound in the UnitedStates, selling under such labels as ``Il Numero Uno.''   Macy's was reported ready to sell it for $14.95 a pound.   About 40,000 hams are scheduled for export to the United Statesbefore yearend. Two million prosciutti are exported yearly, mainlyto other European countries.   Prosciutto agent Thomas Phiebig of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., saysprosciutto will be found initially at East Coast specialty shopsafter an Oct. 1 gala dinner to welcome back the Italian ham at NewYork's Hotel Pierre with Gov. Mario Cuomo in attendance.</TEXT></DOC>
