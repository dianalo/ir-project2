Members of Congress and the financial industry said the plan islikely to be substantially modified before winningcongressionalapproval although officials gave Bush credit for moving quickly toaddress the crisis.   ``The president deserves credit for at least putting a plan onthe table,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and a member of theHouse Banking Committee. ``He faced up to a difficult problem thatPresident Reagan spent a year ducking.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Bush's proposal ``gives usa starting point. We'll probably have a lot of people who don't likethis plan.''   Dole himself raised questions about the amount of the tabtaxpayers will be asked to shoulder. Bush's budget director, RichardDarman, estimated that the cost in direct taxpayer funds wouldamount to $39.9 billion over the next 10 years.   Dole called that figure ``a little high. It would begin to crowdsome of these other programs Congress wants, like education, theenvironment. ... I would propose we shrink the taxpayer impact.''   Barney Beeksman, chairman of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, the largest lobbying group for the Sandamp;L industry, saidin a statement he was glad Bush dropped his proposal to impose apremium tax on depositors but he said the league had reservationsabout other parts of the plan.   ``We are neither endorsing nor rejecting it,'' Beeksman said.``There are components of the president's proposal that would beburdensome to our industry if adopted, but we see today's proposalas a first step only.''   Bud Koch, chairman of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions, another Sandamp;L trade association, said his organizationwas unhappy because Bush's plan would not eliminate the discrepancybetween Sandamp;Ls and banks over the amount they pay in deposit insurancepremiums.   ``The basic inequalities that the healthy Sandamp;Ls have lived underfor four years are still there,'' said Koch, the president of FirstFederal Savings Bank of Cleveland.   The American Bankers Association said in a statement that it wasglad that the nation's banks were not being asked to pay to resolvethe Sandamp;L crisis.   ``The burden to fund this crisis will fall largely on the savingsand loans, themselves, where it belongs,'' said C.G. Holthus,president-elect of the ABA. ``We are encouraged that apparentlybanks and their customers will not be asked to bail out the Sandamp;Ls.''   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared at Bush's newsconference where the plan was unveiled and in a statement issuedlater expressed support for the proposal.   ``This comprehensive package of measures to strengthen the thriftindustry, and depository institutions generally, should assure thatthe problems that occurred in the savings and loans will not happenagain,'' Greenspan said in a statement.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee,said he was withholding judgment on Bush's proposal until it wasanalyzed.   But he praised Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady ``fortheir sensitivity to the seriousness of the problem and forpresenting, under pressure, a formal proposal worthy of careful andmost serious consideration.''   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., the chairman of the SenateBanking Committee, promised to move the legislation quickly.   ``I think the proposal is by and large a sensible proposal,'' hesaid. ``I think the structural reforms make sense'' and the proposedchanges in the law would ``put an end to the excessive practices''that have led so many Sandamp;Ls to failure.   But Riegle said the taxpayer cost was ``a substantial amount ofmoney.'' He said he was concerned federal programs such as fightingdrugs and helping education not be hurt as a result.   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, praised Bush and said he supported thesolution, even though any answer to a $50 billion problem wasn'tsomething you'd want to embrace and ``kiss on the mouth.''   ``I think you're going to see some real bipartisanship here,'' hesaid. ``I think we have a reasonable proposal before us.''   Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he had some questions onspecifics, such as including credit unions in the premium increases,but believed ``the major portion of it will fly.''   Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., a member of the banking committee,said he had some concerns but overall the plan was praiseworthy.   ``There is no solution without cost and without pain,'' he said.``This plan tries to ensure that both are fairly shared.''</TEXT></DOC>
