Gen.Prosper Avril and said no elections are possible under his rule.   ``The prerequisites of free and honest elections at all levelscannot be met by the present government,'' said the statement,signed by Haiti's major parties, including the Communists and aconservative coalition.   Avril has promised to allow presidential elections scheduled forOctober.   During a crackdown in January police arrested more than 50opposition activists, who said they were beaten in custody. Allwere released except for the nation's seven most prominentactivists, who were exiled.   The crackdown followed the killing of an army colonel.   After strong criticism from France, the European Community andthe United States, Avril lifted a state of siege and said theexiled leaders could return. Most refused, however, sayingelections were not possible under Avril.   Also Wednesday, the Rev. Willie Romelus, the radical bishop ofthe western city of Jeremie, urged Haitians to boycott carnivalcelebrations later this month to show they oppose the militaryregime.   ``We can't celebrate carnival while the country istopsy-turvy,'' Romelus said on the Roman Catholic Church's RadioSoleil.   The government has said public participation would mean supportfor Avril.   The three-day festivity comes before Lent and is Haiti's mostpopular annual event. All businesses close and thousands of peopledance, sing and drink in the streets to the music of dozens ofbands.   But no carnival has been widely attended since 1985, the yearbefore dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in Franceafter a popular uprising.   Romelus said elections were not possible under ``a regime whichhas violated the constitution.''   ``They (voters) know they have two alternatives: Nov. 29 andJan. 17,'' Romelus said, referring to the November 1987 ElectionDay massacre in which thugs protected by soldiers killed dozens ofvoters, and to army-rigged elections the following January.</TEXT></DOC>
