Constitution: Asampler attached with an ionizing box detector, a NaI detector and aCdTe detector is disposed to the outlet of an off-gas attenuation pipe,while a sampler attached with a NaI detector and a CdTe detector is disposedto the outlet of a charcoal tower respectively. Signals from a pluralityof detectors and information such as off-gas flow rate are inputted intoa computer to determine the quantitative value for Xe-133 thereby judgingthe absence or presence of the fuel failure. If fuel failure should bepresent, the quantitative value for Kr-85 is determined to calculatethe burn-up degree of the failed fuel rod. According to this device,it is possible to detect the fuel failure neither with the interferenceby N-13, etc. nor with the effect of fluctuations in the off-gas flowrate, as well as the position of the failed fuel rod can be estimatedfrom the burn-up degree.
