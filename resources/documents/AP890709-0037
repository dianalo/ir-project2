Police in Jerusalem dispersed a crowd of Israelis who chanted``Death to Arabs!'' and stoned Arab cars in anger over the busattack on Thursday, the deadliest event in the 19-month-oldPalestinian uprising.   Police on horseback charged the stone-throwing Israelis, mostlyOrthodox Jews in black hats and long coats, when rioting eruptedafter the funeral of Moshe Shapiro, 74, one of the bus victims.   Police said 11 Israelis were arrested Sunday, bringing to 27 thenumber arrested since the violence over the bus attack broke out onFriday.   Israeli officials criticized the three days of anti-Arabviolence, which left one Palestinian dead and nine wounded.   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin broke a three-month silenceand condemned the violence.   ``It is self-evident that this despicable crime carried outagainst bus passengers ... caused deep pain in the hearts of everycitizen of Israel,'' the 75-year-old Begin said in a statementreleased by his spokesman Yehiel Kadishai.   ``But the responses we have seen in the last few days will onlysharpen hatred between the two nations and it must be prevented,''he said.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday on Israel's Arabtelevision news: ``I'm sorry for the attacks. These areirresponsible acts that do not help anyone, bring chaos to our land,and do not hurt the Arabs in the end.''   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the Labor Party, saidhis center-left party would decide Monday whether to pull out of thecoalition government led by Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.   Several Labor ministers have called for such a move, sayingprinciples adopted by Likud last week could discourage Palestiniansfrom agreeing to Israel's plan for elections in the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip.   A Labor pullout could topple the government seven months afterIsrael's elections.   Israel television reported Sunday that high-ranking U.S.officials were urging Labor not to leave the government.   A high-ranking U.S. State Department delegation plans to visitIsrael in 10 days to discuss the future of the government's proposalfor elections in the occupied lands.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens summoned U.S. Ambassador WilliamBrown on Sunday to complain that the United States failed to condemnthe bus attack as terrorism, a ministry statement said.   The statement said Arens also told Brown the Palestine LiberationOrganization ``has long ago broken the conditions set by the U.S.government for continuing the (U.S.-PLO) dialogue'' in Tunisia.   The U.S. Embassy had no comment on the statement.   On Sunday, a senior police official said that investigatorsbelieve the bus attacker acted on his own. Palestinian sources saidhe apparently was avenging the beating of a brother by soldiers lastmonth and the arrest of other relatives during the uprising.   Soldiers blew up the home of the suspect, Abdel Hadi SalmanRassem Ghanem, in Gaza's Nusseirat refugee camp on Sunday. Thegovernment often destroys or seals homes to punish Palestinianssuspected of violent attacks.   The United States has condemned the practice as a violation ofdue process rights because most suspects have not faced trial whentheir homes are destroyed.   Ghanem, 23, was in the hospital ward of an unidentified prisonSunday recovering from head and chest injuries suffered when the busplunged into a deep ravine. Police say Ghanem grabbed the steeringwheel from the driver and forced it to crash, killing 14 people,including 10 Israelis and injuring 27.   In the West Bank village of Ramin, near Nablus, 20-year-old AymanHamad was shot in the chest and killed when soldiers opened fire onmasked Palestinians building a roadblock to stop troops fromentering the village, Arab hospital officials said.   In Madana, also near Nablus, Fayez Yousef, 21, was killed by agunshot wound to the chest when troops opened fire on a group ofyouths who stoned an army patrol, Arab reports said.   A military spokesman said the army had hospital reports of adeath in Ramin but was still investigating the circumstances. Hesaid he had no reports of the Madana incident.   The deaths would bring to 552 the number of Palestinians killedin the uprising. Thirty-three Israelis have been killed.   Seven other Palestinians were reported shot and wounded Sunday inclashes with the army.   Under Shamir's election plan, Palestinians in the West Bank andGaza would choose representatives to negotiate with Israel onlimited self-rule.   Shamir maintains the principles voted by Likud on Wednesday donot affect the plan, but U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIcriticized the party's action as ``not helpful'' to the peaceprocess.   Likud said no elections would be held until the uprising ends andthat a program of building Jewish settlements in the occupiedterritories will go forward.</TEXT></DOC>
