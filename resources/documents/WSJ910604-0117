General Electric Co.'s NBC, News Corp., cable operatorCablevision Systems Corp., and Hughes Communications Inc. hadannounced the venture in February 1990. But conflictinginterests between the partners and financial troubles at NewsCorp. conspired to kill Sky Cable.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, General Motors Corp.'s Hughes unit has signed adefinitive agreement for a multi-channel service with afledgling company, U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Inc., a unitof Hubbard Broadcasting Inc. of St. Paul-Minneapolis. Theagreement calls for USSB to receive satellite space on asatellite Hughes is building and is scheduled to launch inJuly 1994.   USSB is paying Hughes &quot;in excess of $100 million,&quot; thecompanies said. That is far below the $1 billion price taggiven to Sky Cable when it was announced last year. Sky Cablewas going to supply subscribers with as many as 108 channelsvia a napkin-size satellite receiver a subscriber could placeon a window sill.   Sky Cable flamed out because each of its four partners&quot;had different needs,&quot; said Eddy Hartenstein, senior vicepresident at Hughes. &quot;NBC was spending time and moneyacquiring the Financial News Network, and News Corp. had torestructure. In order to go forward, you needed all fourpartners. That wasn't going to happen.&quot;   There also was the prospect of disagreement among partnersover how the service would be sold to households. Thoughdirect-broadcast satellite TV competes with cable service,Cablevision was likely to argue that cable operators shouldbe the local sales agent for the system.   In December, there were hints the project would never getoff the ground as Cablevision Vice Chairman William Bell saideach partner was &quot;re-evaluating&quot; its commitment.   The USSB and Hughes venture is somewhat different from SkyCable. For instance, USSB and Hughes will be competingservices. &quot;We're not a partner, we're a customer,&quot; saidStanley E. Hubbard II, USSB's vice president. USSB will havea capacity for a minimum of 15 channels with the capabilityof exceeding 20 channels when the first of two Hughessatellites is launched. Hughes, meanwhile, would provideabout 70 channels.   Mr. Hubbard said USSB is projecting it would break even inthe second year with only &quot;a few million&quot; subscribers. Heprojected USSB would have a &quot;positive cash flow&quot; in its thirdyear.   There are close to 60 million households with cabletelevision, but channel capacity on some older systems islimited, and rebuilding them is costly. Direct-broadcastsatellite television has been trumpeted as the next wave,with dozens of channels reserved for pay-per-viewprogramming, including sporting events and recently releasedmotion pictures.   Mr. Hubbard said USSB would be a &quot;hybrid,&quot; as some of thechannels will be reserved for free, advertiser-supportedprogramming.   Stanley S. Hubbard, president and chief executive officerof Hubbard Broadcasting, was one of the earliest advocates ofdirect-broadcast satellite service, which to date has failedto gain a foothold in the U.S. television business. &quot;We'vespent millions of dollars on items such as satellite dishsize, subscription price,&quot; the younger Mr. Hubbard said. &quot;Weknow the marketplace. We've been talking about thistechnology for ten years.&quot;   Eventually, the USSB and Hughes services will be capableof transmitting more than 100 separate channels, includingCD-quality audio services. Like Sky Cable, the USSB andHughes services also hope to beam so-called high-definitionTV signals once the technology is introduced in the U.S.later in the decade.   The newly announced satellite services would usetechnology similar to that envisioned by Sky Cable. Thecompanies hope the receiver would be napkin-size or smallerand would sell for about $300.   Direct-broadcast satellite television has stumbled in theU.S. In Japan, more than 30 companies compete in the DBS areaand more than 12% of Japanese households have DBS technology.   Executives at USSB and Hughes are confident the newservice won't have a fate similar to Sky Cable. &quot;This is adefinitive agreement,&quot; said Mr. Hartenstein of HughesCommunications. &quot;It isn't a memorandum of understanding, likeSky Cable was.&quot;   Stanely E. Hubbard said, &quot;Sky Cable's mistake wasannouncing a deal that wasn't finished. This is a 100% go.We'll be in business come July 1994. Period.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
