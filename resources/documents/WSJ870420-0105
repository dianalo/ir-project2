OK, TakeTwo Bowls and Call in the Morning---By Meg SullivanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Add to the list of the world's cures for stress: the caressing of Tibetan copper-colored bowls with wooden mallets.    At least that's the method practiced by Kabbalah Bach, a 52-year-old dental hygienist. For the past three years, Ms. Bach has spent many of her evenings as a self-described &quot;sound healer,&quot; conducting &quot;healing concerts&quot; as a cure for stress.    The main attraction are the Tibetan bowls, placed at various points on a reclining client. Ms. Bach then rubs a wooden mallet around their rims, eventually producing a high-pitched whine (from the bowls, not the client) similar to that made by rubbing a crystal goblet.    But there's more. During the concerts, which are held in her home or along the boardwalk in Venice, Calif., Ms. Bach also plays Tibetan cymbals, large gongs, drums, maracas and conches -- all designed, she says, to &quot;realign the body's natural energy field.&quot;    At one recent performance, Bobbie Japka, a clinical psychologist, pronounced the treatment a success. &quot;When you put the bowl down on me, I could feel the pulsating,&quot; she tells Ms. Bach. &quot;Suddenly, I got very warm.&quot;    What's the secret? The importer of the bowls says they are made of a unique alloy of &quot;at least nine&quot; different metals -- including iron from meteorites -- which accounts for their mystical properties. But Ms. Bach is less forthcoming.    &quot;We are constantly being bombarded by these sounds and we don't realize how the tension is building,&quot; she says. &quot;How it does this, the words fail me.&quot;    The words quickly return when Ms. Bach is asked how much the treatments cost. A three-hour session goes for $10, but a cassette tape only costs $9. She doesn't make any specific therapeutic claims for her concerts, but many satisfied clients give her free word-of-mouth advertising.    Camille Bilger, a 50-year-old interviewer with the Los Angeles City Housing Authority, says a recent concert &quot;really helped&quot; her get over a bad day at work. Eleanore Floboda, a 41-year-old administrator with the city of Los Angeles, says she feels rejuvenated after a session. And Ms. Japka, the psychologist, says she was on the brink of a mind-out-of-body experience before being distracted by the sound of a person sucking Lifesavers.    Ms. Bach isn't surprised. &quot;You have to be careful,&quot; she says. &quot;You can get real spacey with these things.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
