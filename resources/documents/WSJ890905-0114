For two hours, there will be no visitors, and all are asked to please refrain from disturbing their neighbors.    &quot;It used to be kind of a Wild West atmosphere in here,&quot; says Mr. Brown. &quot;I think this is going to work out fine.&quot;    But Mr. Brown's charges aren't five-year-olds. They're the 80 or so adult civil servants who work for the Pierce County Assessor-Treasurer's office, and they're not so sure about Mr. Brown's plan.    Mr. Brown, an insurance agent who was elected assessor-treasurer last fall, thinks he can boost productivity by invoking a two-hour quiet time every morning. He hopes to give workers a chance to catch up on homework and map out a schedule for the day, eliminating distractions that used to result in a &quot;two-hour coffee break.&quot;    To that end, all but a few workers will be forbidden from talking, and movement around the office will be discouraged. A &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign will be posted on the door and, except in emergencies, the phone essentially will be disconnected. An operator will take messages.    The quiet-time proposal, which was to go into effect this morning, has already drawn a noisy reaction.    One employee grumbles that it seems &quot;more like kindergarten.&quot; Some wonder how the office -- which appraises real estate and collects property taxes -- will be able to avoid miffing citizens.    Sheldon Cook, the man Mr. Brown defeated in the race for the assessor-treasurer post last year, says he hears that the idea is wrecking morale. &quot;They are just totally discouraged,&quot; he says. &quot;I feel awfully, awfully sorry for the taxpayers.&quot;    Mr. Brown, however, says phone operators and a handful of others will be able to handle most of the queries, and that the advantage to the public of his office catching up on a big backlog of paper work will more than outweigh any inconvenience taxpayers may feel.    Moreover, he says the idea, which he experienced while working as a claims adjuster for Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., has a proven track record.    A Fireman's Fund spokesman said, however, that his company is now &quot;going in the other direction. We have developed more of a service-oriented system.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
