Michael Levin, a philosophy professor at City College, gave aspeech Wednesday at Long Island University's Brooklyn campusdefending the argument that white fear of black crime is logicaland morally correct, said Frank Post, an LIU spokesman.   Police formed a blockade at the auditorium's doors and kept theprotesters from entering, Post said.   Levin has written in academic journals that on average, blacksare less intelligent than whites.   ``The difference in intelligence is inarguable,'' the New YorkPost quoted Levin as saying. ``There's good evidence that there's asignificant genetic contribution'' to that alleged difference.   In his speech, Levin said, ``whites have a right to be afraid ofblacks. That's reasonable.'' He argued that police have a right toinclude blacks in suspect profiles used to make drug arrestsbecause ``blacks are so largely involved in crime.''   After Levin had finished speaking, one of the protesters outsideyelled that Levin should be removed from the campus, Post said.   Of the nine who were arrested, seven were charged withdisorderly conduct, one was charged with harassment and one wascharged with riot and assaulting a police officer, said policespokesman Fred Weiner.   The university, whose student population is 70 percent black,had considered revoking Levin's invitation to its Urban Ethicsconference, Post said. A panel of students, faculty andadministrators decided that in the interest of free speech and afree exchange of ideas on a university campus, Levin should beallowed to speak.   Levin was escorted from the university unharmed.</TEXT></DOC>
