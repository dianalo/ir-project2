EverettKoop's declaration that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.   His report lumping nicotine with heroin and cocaine asphysiologically addictive drugs underscored the seemingcontradiction between the government's support of tobacco pricesand its warnings about using the product.   But at the Agriculture Department, where cafeteria patrons haveno-smoking or smoking areas, ban-the-butt crusades are viewed witha certain cynicism. The attitude is that Congress makes the laws,and if Congress wants the farm price of tobacco supported atminimum levels, it's USDA's job to do it.   ``Careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettesand other forms of tobacco are addicting,'' Koop said last week inthe surgeon general's annual report on smoking and health. ``Anextensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug intobacco that causes addiction.''   The USDA has run federal price supports for tobacco since theearly 1930s. Basically, in return for going along with controls onplantings and marketings, growers are assured a floor price on whatthey produce.   The anti-smoking campaigns have affected cigarette use, althoughit's hard to be precise about their impact, says Verner Grise ofthe department's Economic Research Service. Price increases bycigarette manufacturers and rising taxes have boosted retail costssharply, prompting some smokers to quit or cut down.   Since 1981, total U.S. cigarette consumption has dropped morethan 10 percent, and last year Americans consumed 575 billioncigarettes, or ``pieces,'' the fewest since 1972.   Grise said the decline in domestic cigarette use isn't over andthe surgeon general's report last week will add to the downturn.   ``I don't know that we'll see any accelerated drop inconsumption, but certainly it (the report) will be a factor in thecontinued drop in consumption of one-half to 2 percent a year,''Grise said in an interview.   Grise said he thinks that ``there will be a push for anadditional warning label'' on cigarette packages to indicatenicotine is addictive. ``And I suppose that a push for prohibitionor restrictions on where minors can buy cigarettes ... is going tobe stepped up,'' he said.   More than 40 states and the District of Columbia have laws thateither ban smoking in certain places or segregate smokers fromnon-smokers. At least 10 states regulate smoking in workplaces.   The rate of smoking cigarettes by adults 18 years and olderpeaked at 4,345 cigarettes a year _ more than 217 packs of 20 each_ in 1963 and has generally declined since then. Last year'saverage was 3,201 cigarattes, or 160 packs, the lowest since WorldWar II.   The figures are used statistically to compare year-to-yearchanges and include both smokers and non-smokers.   Meanwhile, U.S. cigarette exports are up sharply _ a record100.2 billion pieces last year, a 56 percent jump from 1986.   With domestic use declining, the export market grows inimportance to the cigarette industry. An additional boost couldhave been provided if a proposal by tobacco-state lawmakers hadsucceeded.   The Senate Agriculture Committee, at the urging of Sen. JesseHelms, R-N.C., last year inserted in the trade bill a move to maketobacco exports eligible for Export Enhancement Program subsidies,with any resultant losses to be borne by the USDA's CommodityCredit Corp.   The panel acted without much fanfare and major debate did notcome until the measure moved to the Senate floor.   The Senate last July 10 killed, 51-43, an attempt by Sen. JohnChafee, R-R.I., to delete the plan from the bill.   Chafee claimed the $39 million cost estimated by theCongressional Budget Office represented a violation of the 1982no-net-cost agreement governing the tobacco program.   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and other tobacco-state lawmakersretorted that the agreement was never supposed to have affectedexport programs and that in any case it was not a smoking issue butan economic one.   No similar measure, however, was contained in the House versionof the legislation and when the trade bill went to a House-Senateconference committee the tobacco provision was quietly dropped.   The 1982 No-Net-Cost Tobacco Program Act required that growershad to pay, through assessments, the costs of operating the federalsupport program. To be eligible, producers of most kinds of tobaccoare required to go along with federal production controls.   In 1986, additional legislation changed the quota-settingprocedure, price support levels and the no-net-cost assessments forflue-cured and burley tobacco, the main types produced by U.S.growers. The changes were aimed at making U.S. tobacco morecompetitive in world markets and to bring supplies into balancewith demands.   Grise said the no-net-cost law has worked and, combined with the1986 changes, has put the government's tobacco program on a muchsounder basis.   ``Except for $10 million to $15 million of administrative costs,the tobacco program in recent years hasn't cost the taxpayer anymoney,'' Grise said.   Even before the 1982 law, tobacco support operations wererelatively small compared with those for some other farmcommodities that piled up huge crop surpluses and then cost a lotto dispose of, he said.   According to USDA, in the 1986 fiscal year, for example, netoutlays by the Commodity Credit Corp. were a record $25.8 billion.Of that, tobacco support operations cost $253 million, comparedwith $12.1 billion for feed grains, $3.44 billion for wheat, $2.34billion for dairy, and $2.14 billion for cotton.   Since then, there have been no net outlays by CCC for tobacco,according to department figures.   The tobacco industry says more than 700,000 Americans earn atleast part of their incomes from tobacco, and that retail sales ofmore than $30 billion a year generate $9 billion in federal andstate tax revenues.   At the producer level, Grise says the 1982 census of agricultureshowed about 179,000 tobacco farms in the country but he says thoseprobably have declined to fewer than 170,000. In 1954, there wereabout 512,000.   Last year's tobacco harvest came from 601,700 acres in 16states. Total output was around 1.23 billion pounds, with 65percent produced in North Carolina and Kentucky. In all, accordingto USDA, the 1987 crop had a farm value of $1.93 billion, makingtobacco the sixth-ranked U.S. commodity in terms of value. Corn ledat $12.1 billion.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday May 22</NOTE></DOC>
