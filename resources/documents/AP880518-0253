Legal Aid attorneys, who represent many of the MartiniqueHotel's 455 families, said that as many as 80 rooms have beenillegally subdivided.   City officials, however, said the rooms do meet state standardsand have not been illegally divided. One of the hotel's owners alsodenied the Legal Aid claims.   Suzanne Trazoff, a spokeswoman for the city Human ResourcesAdministration, said owners are not making more money bysubdividing, since they are paid by the person and two families ofthree are now living where a family of six would once have been put.   ``For New York City to decide that smaller families don't needprivacy is clearly a surprise to me and a violation of stateregulation,'' said state State Social Services Commissioner CesarPerales after hearing the Legal Aid attorneys' claims. ``Myregulations clearly apply to all families.''   Perales ordered an inspection Thursday and said the city wouldbe ordered not to put any families in substandard rooms.   The subdivided rooms are barely large enough to contain adresser and beds, and Legal Aid Attorney Steven Banks said theylack bathrooms and ``furniture necessary for daily living _ liketables and chairs to eat and do homework on.''   Salvatore Tuccelli, who identified himself as one of the ownersof the hotel, angrily denied the charges.   Tuccelli said the Martinique had begun using some of the hotel's57 two-room suites to house two small families each rather than onelarge one, but denied that the hotel had illegally subdivided anyrooms or housed anyone in ``cubicles.''   ``There were no walls built. There were no divisions ofanything,'' he said. ``If you don't believe me, you can call theBuildings Department.''   A spokesman for the Buildings Department, Vahe Tiryakian,confirmed Tuccelli's contention.   ``We inspected several of the rooms in the Hotel Martinique,''he said. ``Our inspector found absolutely no alteration work thatchanged the size of the rooms. They are, in some of the setups,sharing the bathroom ... but that is not disallowed by the buildingcode. There's nothing illegal about that.''   Perales has said, however, that state regulations require aprivate bathroom.   Tuccelli said the rooms in the two-room suites varied in size,and that some of them ranged from 130 square feet to 180 squarefeet. He said he didn't know if any were smaller. A 9-by-12-footroom would contain 108 square feet.   He also denied that the rooms were barren of furniture.``Whatever they need, we give them,'' he said.   Ms. Trazoff acknowledged that conditions in the hotel were lessthan ideal, but said the state knows the city is trying to changethe situation.   ``Our first obligation is to provide a bed to every family.Nobody has ever said hotels are a long-term answer,'' Ms. Trazoffsaid.   Ms. Trazoff said the city is aware the hotel has been dividingtwo-room suites but said it was to accommodate smaller families.She said there used to be many families of six or more, but mostfamilies there now are smaller.   ``They're getting the same money as they did when they housed afamily of six in one room as they do housing two families of threein two rooms,'' she said.   The city pays $17 a day for the first person and $12 for eachadditional person per room. The monthly cost for a family of threeis $1,230; in welfare cases, the federal government reimburses thecity for 50 percent of that cost, while the state takes care of 25percent.   Last year, Perales ordered the city to stop using onecockroach-infested room in the Martinique. It had no tables andchairs and the family of three shared a bathroom with another womanand her four children.   That was the first time New York state had ordered the city tomove a family out of a welfare room. The state said, ``TheMartinique fails to even minimally conform to the standards setforth in department regulations.''   Perales said the Legal Aid Society sent his office a lettersaying other rooms at the Martinique had similar violations,including putting families of three in 9-by-12 rooms.   ``We require that when a local welfare department puts up afamily in a hotel or motel anywhere in the state that they be givena private bathroom and other necessities'' _ like tables andchairs, Perales said. He said his staff would inspect theMartinique on Thursday.   The city recently announced a plan in which it hopes to havehomeless families out of all welfare hotels in five years. Itcurrently houses 5,189 homeless families, of which 3,437 are inhotels and the rest in shelters.</TEXT></DOC>
