Michael Gist went on a spree of overseas dialing that he figuredhis roommates would have to pay for. The call he will pay for,perhaps with a prison term, is a bomb threat to the U.S. Embassy inBeirut, Lebanon.   Michael Gist, 18, originally of Canoga Park, Calif., pleadedguilty Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis to one countof making harassing telephone calls, a misdemeanor. MagistrateFloyd Boline ordered a presentence investigation and released Giston a $5,000 unsecured bond.   The telephone harassment charge is punishable by up to sixmonths in prison and a $50,000 fine. However, under a plea bargainwith the U.S. Attorney's office, Gist would serve a maximumsentence of three months if Boline approves.   Gist moved to Minnesota from California in July, according toAssistant U.S. Attorney Richard Vosepka.   During Wednesday's court appearance, Gist told Boline that hewas angry with his friends for moving out without paying the renton their apartment in the Twin Cities suburb of Fridley.   Since the apartment telephone was still in the other roommates'names, Gist said he and his girlfriend decided to spend the nightof Aug. 5 making overseas calls.   In his call to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Gist spoke with theembassy switchboard operator. Gist said he asked to speak withsomeone ``higher up,'' but was told no one else was availablebecause it was 4:10 a.m. in Beirut. Gist said he then told theoperator that a bomb would go off at the embassy at noon.   ``Then he asked me what my name was,'' he said. Gist hung up.   The long-distance operator came back on the line to ask theembassy if the call had been completed and the switchoard operatordescribed the call as a bomb threat, Vosepka said.   The operator immediately gave Gist's telephone number to theembassy, which notified the State Department in Washington. TheState Department called the FBI, which had agents staking outGist's apartment in about an hour, Vosepka said. FBI agentsarrested Gist the following evening.</TEXT></DOC>
