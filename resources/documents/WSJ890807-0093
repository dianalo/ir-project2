The testing showed oil-flow rates of as much as 5,400 barrels a day, about the same as rates turned in by the first well in June. Taken together, the Los Angeles-based energy company said, the tests on both wells indicate that the ultimate recovery at Point McIntyre could reach 300 million barrels.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Arco shares closed at $101.125, up $3, on heavy volume of slightly more than one million shares.    The discovery at Point McIntyre, about two miles north of the giant Prudhoe Bay producing area, was announced in January by Arco and its partners, Exxon Corp. and British Petroleum Co. Their ownership interests in the field are still being negotiated. Arco has said, though, that it expects to retain an interest between 30% and 50%.    The second delineation well is about 2.5 miles from the discovery well, initially drilled last year. Test results from that well yielded a sustained flow rate of 2,500 barrels a day.    &quot;We have confirmed the presence of a high-quality reservoir with good porosity and permeability,&quot; said Jerry Dees, Arco Alaska's vice president, exploration.    Arco previously said production at Point McIntyre won't begin until at least the early 1990s. Analysts noted, however, that aside from possibly being the largest domestic oil discovery in recent years, it also is important because Prudhoe Bay production is slowing.    The Point McIntyre find &quot;comes at a good time,&quot; said Eugene Nowak, an oil analyst at the New York brokerage firm of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He added that although it is too early to estimate production costs, &quot;It doesn't appear that there's anything inordinate about it that would suggest they'd be extremely high.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
