The dollar closed at 133.42 yen, up 0.47 yen from Friday's closeof 132.95 yen, with spot volume estimated at $4.8 billion.   After opening at 133.82 yen, the U.S. currency graduallydeclined, then reversed direction after Japanese trade figures forAugust were released late in the afternoon, said Hajime Sugiyama ofthe Bank of Tokyo.   ``The trade surplus, $4.9 billion, was less than most of theinvestors had expected. Now they have started worrying that theU.S. trade balance for July may not be too bad,'' he said.   The U.S. trade figures are scheduled to be announced Wednesday.   ``That's why some investors sold yen to buy dollars,'' Sugiyamaadded.

Steels and high-tech issues, which attracted investors duringthe afternoon session, pushed up the Nikkei index, which hadfluctuated in the morning. Volume traded on the market's firstsection was estimated at 700 million shares.   ``Volume was quite satisfactory for a day like this, consideringit's Monday, especially when everybody is worried about the U.S.trade figures due soon,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities,who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``Investors are getting rather optimistic here,'' the analystadded.   Other dealers said a fall in crude oil prices last week wipedout Tokyo investors' concern over inflation and higher interestrates in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
