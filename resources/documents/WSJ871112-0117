MitchellStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) </IN><TEXT>   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. filed a $279 million racketeering suit against former top executives and major holders of FirstSouth, a failed Pine Bluff, Ark.-based thrift.    The suit, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Ark., charges that Howard J. Weichern Jr., former chairman and chief executive officer of the thrift, conspired with and made improper loans to George S. Watson and A. Starke Taylor III, partners in Watson andamp; Taylor Realty Co., Dallas, and major FirstSouth holders.    The suit alleges that Mr. Weichern approved more than $300 million of loans to the two partners -- going well beyond regulatory limits on loans to one group -- without seeking approval of the thrift's board and without receiving any guarantees, audits or appraisals from the borrowers.    About $93 million of the loans remains unpaid.    A lawyer representing the developers said he hadn't reviewed the FSLIC suit and declined to comment. He noted, however, that Messrs. Watson and Taylor previously filed suit against the FSLIC in its role as FirstSouth's receiver. In that suit, the developers basically echo many of the FSLIC charges against the thrift but deny that they were involved in any conspiracy with Mr. Weichern.    According to the developers' suit, the thrift's officers repeatedly assured them that loans were being sold to other institutions to keep FirstSouth within federal lending limits. In a statement, the developers said they weren't controlling shareholders, as the FSLIC contends, and weren't &quot;in a position to know what FirstSouth management was doing internally.&quot;    In its suit, the FSLIC also said it is seeking federal bankruptcy court permission to include Roderick D. Reed, the thrift's former president and chief operating officer, as a defendant. The court is overseeing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing by Mr. Reed.    FirstSouth was declared insolvent last December. It had $1.68 billion in assets at that time.    Mr. Weichern and Mr. Reed weren't immediately available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
