Vehicles carrying thousands of soldiers bearing rifles rumbledout of this northwestern province after a band played pop music andthousands of Cambodians threw the troops flowers and flags in agovernment-organized ceremony.   Vietnam says it is conducting a six-day withdrawal of its last26,000 troops from Siem Reap and several otehr areas of the country.   But guerrillas charged that Vietnam was faking the troop movementand actually hiding and disguising its troops.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978 and within twoweeks toppled the fanatical Khmer Rouge regime, a former Communistcomrade that had launched bloody attacks on the Vietnamese border.   During its four-year rule, the Pol Pot-led Khmer Rouge killedhundreds of thousands of Cambodians as it tried to turn Cambodiainto an agrarian commune.   At the height of its conflict with Cambodian guerrillas, Vietnamhad 200,000 men in the country, according to Vietnamese officers.They say it began annual partial pullouts in 1982 and that 55,300Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, including 25,000 in 1977-78.   The invasion also brought economic blockades by non-Communistcountries that kept Vietnam one of the world's poorest counties.   With the collapse of peace talks in Paris last month, the pulloutwould leave the Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government fightingthree guerrilla groups backed by China, Thailand and other countries.   Maj. Gen. Huol Savorn, commander of Cambodia's 4th Army Region,said he expected a major guerrilla offensive after the pullout ofthe some 10,000 soldiers of ``Front 479'' from Siem Reap, Battambangand Oddar Meanchey provinces. These are among Thai border provincesthe guerrillas have been strongly contesting for years.   ``They are going to fight a lot'' to try to occupy border areasbefore striking inland, he told reporters.   ``But they will not be able to achieve this,'' he said ``With theequipment that they have, they can only carry out hit-and-runattacks.''   The Paris talks failed to agree on international monitoring ofthe troop movement, and the only official foreign observers seen inSiem Reap were from Vietnam and its close allies Laos, Cuba and theSoviet Union, the main source of arms for the war.   Of the absence of Western observers, Soviet delegate and ForeignMinistry official Genrich Kinreed said ``it was astonishing why theyinsisted (on international monitoring) but didn't come.'' Hisfour-member team was led by Suleimenov Oljas, member of the SupremeSoviet, or parliament.   About 50 journalists from non-Communist countries watched thetroop movement.   The Cambodians bade the soldiers farewell in a two-hour ceremonyon the rain-soaked gravel road outside a kindergarten built byVietnamese soldiers.   Banners expressing sadness at the troops' departure and hopes forcontinued Vietnamese-Cambodian ``solidarity'' were raised by groupsof students, soldiers, and schoolchildren wearing red kerchiefs _the ``young pioneers'' of the ruling Cambodian Communist Party. Theysweated under a hot sun that charged in just after a morning mistlifted.   On a wooden stage with the military officers, four Buddhist monksin flowing saffron robes chanted prayers for peace.   Cambodian and Vietnamese officials took turns with speeches thatdenounced the ``Pol Pot genocide'' and defiantly claimed theguerrillas cannot take any territory.   Maj. Gen. Khieu Anh Lon, commander of Front 479, hugged aCambodian commander in front of a blue banner displaying thenational emblems of Vietnam's yellow star and Cambodia's Angkor Wattemple.   A young pioneer gave him her kerchief while three women intraditional costumes presented a bouquet of flowers.   The general walked down the muddied road, picked up a young boy,and climbed into his weather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin thewithdrawal.   The Vietnamese troops, whose intervention triggered fighting thatkilled tens of thousands of people and split almost all Asia intotwo hostile camps, waved yellow and purple flowers as theydisappeared down the road.</TEXT></DOC>
