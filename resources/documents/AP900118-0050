Carol Keenan, 38, alleged she was the victim of a pattern ofdiscrimination, and her colleagues argued they were transferred outof the homicide unit merely because they supported her.   After two months of testimony, the U.S. District Court juryWednesday awarded the five officers $640,000 in compensatorydamages and $1.8 million in punitive damages.   The largest part went to Keenan, now a detective in SouthPhiladelphia. The jury awarded her $220,000 in compensatory damagesand $600,000 in punitive damages.   Keenan, who joined the police force in 1976, predicted theverdict will help other women in the department.   ``The next woman who makes this kind of complaint won't beignored _ they'll listen,'' she said.   Keenan contended throughout the trial that she repeatedly triedto resolve the problem informally, but officials refused to takeher complaints seriously.   She filed the lawsuit in 1988, saying she was subjected tounusual scrutiny by Robert Grasso after he became commander ofhomicide. She also alleged discrimination led to her transfer fromthe unit in 1987.   She was joined in the lawsuit by Lawrence Gerrard, Walter Smith,Ernest Gilbert and Daniel Rosenstein.   The city planned to appeal.   ``The verdict is totally out of proportion to justice, law andreality and will be appealed from now to infinity,'' said DeputyCity Solicitor Richard G. Freeman.   Jurors said they hoped their decision sends a message to thecity.   ``I would say there was simply little, if any, defense,'' saidjury foreman Thomas Gilbert.   Juror Harry Wilson Jr. said he hoped the verdict showed citypolice officials ``that they have to be fair in their treatment ofall their employees, flat and simple.''</TEXT></DOC>
