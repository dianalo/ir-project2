Pan Am on Tuesday announced a new round-trip restricted fare of$298 to London from New York, Washington, Detroit and Miami. Thenew fare represents a 41 percent cut from the airline's previouslowest fare of $508 for the same route, Pan Am spokeswoman PamelaHanlon said Wednesday.   In addition to the London ``Super Eurosaver,'' Pan Am said italso is offering new ``Eurosaver'' fares to 22 other Europeancities that are up to 30 percent cheaper.   American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Trans World AirlinesInc. quickly said they would match the new fares in the marketswhere they compete with Pan Am. Continental Airlines said it wasstudying the possibility of fare cuts, but had made no decision.   The reductions are designed to stimulate U.S. passenger trafficto Europe, which has suffered recently from the dollar's declineagainst major foreign currencies.   In addition, Ms. Hanlon said, it is part of a strategy for PanAm to move away from the use of travel consolidators, who buy largevolumes of discounted tickets from airlines, mark them up 10percent to 20 percent and then resell them to travel agents andconsumers.   ``It is part of a strategy to move away from the consolidators,offering a competitive product directly to the public and throughthe retail travel agents,'' she said.   The $298 Pan Am London fare can be used for travel only oncertain days of the week, and the first day of travel must bebetween Oct. 16 and Dec. 7. Travel must be completed by Dec. 15.The non-refundable tickets must be purchased 45 days in advance,except for those bought before Sept. 30.   ``Eurosaver'' fares to other European cities must be purchased30 days in advance and within 48 hours of making the reservation.They also are non-refundable. The cities include Paris; Rome;Frankfurt, West Germany; Athens, Greece; Brussels, Belgium; andZurich, Switzerland.</TEXT></DOC>
