But government critics, including those who appearing on thescreen, contend that television access remains minimal and thatmore airtime is needed to create an informed public for thesingle-candidate presidential balloting planned for later this year.   Chile has no commercial television. One national network is runby the government. All other channels are operated by universitiesthat have been under government control since the military tookover in a 1973 coup.   Political debates, a popular feature on television before thecoup, were prohibited by the military rulers, and general politicalinformation was limited to the broadcast of government views.   But that changed in January when the national university'sChannel 11 in Santiago began broadcasting a Sunday night programcalled ``Currents of Opinion,'' a two-hour pre-recorded politicaldebate. Participants came from both the government and theopposition.   In March, Channel 13 of the Catholic University introduced``Face the Nation,'' a live Monday night program in which threejournalists question representatives of a particular politicalparty.   But the state television, the only one that broadcastsnationally, has not yet followed suit.   The return of political debates has coincided with a limitedincrease in the coverage of opposition political parties ontelevision newscasts.   Members of the opposition and some media experts, acknowledgingthat they see some progress toward more balanced politicalpresentations on television, say it's still not enough.   ``I think what television is doing is still absolutelyinsufficient to give Chileans ample and pluralist information inthe face of the upcoming election campaign,'' said Jaime Moreno,president of Chile's Journalists Association.   The new debates indicate ``some progress,'' Moreno said in aninterview, but he added that the opposition still facesdiscrimination in news programs.   Chileans will vote later this year _ no date has been set _ foror against a single, military-picked candidate who, if approved inthe referendum-style balloting, will serve as president from 1989to 1997.   President Augusto Pinochet, the 72-year-old army commander wholed the 1973 coup, appears to be aggressively seeking thenomination and is considered the most probable candidate.   Chile's Roman Catholic Church and some foreign governments,including the United States, have said equal access to televisionis needed to ensure a fair election campaign and ensure the newgovernment's legitimacy.   Enrique Krauss, a Christian Democrat who has represented hisparty in several debates, said TV access remains too limited.   ``Debates are not enough,'' Krauss said. ``The general newscoverage today continues to be dominated by a non-democratic line.''   Hour-long nightly news programs commonly dedicate a half hour ormore to activities or comments by Pinochet and other officials, aswell as public works projects and other pro-government information.   Figures compiled by a Santiago-based private social researchinstitute indicated that, during a five-day period in late January,Santiago's TV channels devoted 75 minutes to government views onpolitical issues, and the opposition got 7 minutes, 54 seconds.During the first week of March, coverage allocated to thegovernment was 88 minutes, with 2 minutes, 13 seconds for theopposition.   A similar report by the Christian Democratic Party concludedthat 98 percent of television's political coverage in 1987 wasdevoted to pro-government news.   Rene Abeliuk, a Social Democrat who has also participated inseveral debates, said television's new approach to politicalcoverage ``is just a beginning that should be followed by a morebalanced coverage of the opposition views in the newscasts.''   Participants in the debates say they have generally been allowedto state their views without restrictions. Some of the topics ofthe debates have been highly sensitive for the government, such asalleged human rights violations.   Television officials say they are working without governmentinterference.   ``We are inviting anybody we want to participate in the debate,and we intend to continue to do so,'' said Roberto Pulido, one ofthe inteviewers on ``Face the Nation.''   TV officials acknowledge that the political opening ontelevision is still limited. Juan Agustin Vargas, an executive ofthe Catholic University television station, explained: ``Ourchannel has done whatever it has been able to during these years.And we've gradully been giving more political information.''   Although TV political debates were popular before the militarycoup, the new ones have not attracted the massive audiences someexpected.   ``Currents of Opinion'' rose from a rating of 5.6 in the firstfew weeks to around 11 March 27. The same day, another station got39.9 points by showing ``The North and the South,'' the U.S.mini-series set during the American Civil War.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, April 13</NOTE></DOC>
