 Thieves get intothe telephone system in one of two ways: by cracking the securitypassword on the Direct Inward System Access (DISA) feature on thePBX or by using the second dial tone that appears after the callforwarding or call processing features are accessed.andP;  The thievesare computer hackers and people who resell stolen long distancephone calls for a profit.andP;  All three major telephone carriers saya company is responsible for all calls, legitimate or fraudulent,made from the company's PBX.andP;  Companies can protect themselves byrestricting international calls, using monitoring servicesprovided by the interexchange carrier, monitoring itself, usingautomatic number identification for 800 numbers, turning off DISAat night, and using anti-fraud devices.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer CrimesPBXTelecommunicationsComputer HackersTelephone Companies.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>TOLL FRAUDandM;It usually happens in the middle of the night or on a long weekend.andP;  Callersget into your PBX and/or your private network and rack up thousands ofdollars in long distance, usually to foreign countries -- and stick you withthe bill.andM;These phone-call thieves get into your telephone system by cracking thesecurity password on the Direct Inward System Access (DISA) feature on yourPBX or by using the second dialtone they get after accessing call forwardingor call processing features.andP;  Because this second dialtone is requested fromthe CO by your phone equipment, you get biled for the call that follows.andM;When the caller uses your 800 number to get into your DISA or other features,you have double the trouble because you are paying for both the incoming andthe outgoing call.andM;Al Kramer, General Counsel for NATA and a member of the law firm Wood,Lucksinger andamp; Epstein, reports that CPE fraud is a growing problem.andP;  &quot;But datais hard to come by because telephone companies, long distance companies andcompanies that experience fraud do not want to release any numbers.&quot;andM;The &quot;official estimate&quot; is $500 million in toll fraud.andP;  But Barry Berman,president of US Tele-Comm, a private New York City payphone company, says thefigure is closer to $5 billion.andP;  He says over a weekend a single company canlose $1 million to phone fraud.andP;  Berman is a board member of NATA and isinvolved in several payphone associations and the Communications FraudControl Association.andM;He says phone system hackers are not just kids.andP;  &quot;Organized crime is heavilyinvolved in this.andP;  But organized crime doesn't mean the Mafia.andP;  It meanspeople who resell stolen long distance phone calls for a profit.&quot;andM;Aspokesperson for a major long distance carrier echoed Berman's concern aboutorganized crime as well as his explanation that some hackers are organizedinto &quot;call sell&quot; groups that use the pirated long distance calling cardnumbers as wel as the DISA codes to provide an illegal phone service topaying customers at payphones or other locations.andM;Berman talks about a house in Queens, NY, which has dozens of small cubicles,one chair and one phone.andP;  People who want to make calls line up outside.andO;They give the number they want to call to an &quot;operator,&quot; who dials thenumber.andP;  When it answers, the person is directed to a cubicle.andP;  The &quot;operatorassistance&quot; is designed to conceal the dialing pattern.andP;  The caller pays forthe call in cash.andP;  Typically $3 to $5.andM;The &quot;hackers,&quot; who discover the &quot;dialing patterns,&quot; are often skilledcomputer engineers, paid large sums of money to create hacking programs thatcan uncover one or two good numbers an hour.andM;Why is Berman so concerned with CPEFraud?andP;  He believes all telephone fraud isconnected -- that payphone fraud and CPE fraud feed off each other to createa huge, expensive problem that affects long distance  companies, payphoneowners, CPE vendors, manufacturers and individual users.andM;He warns most PBXs are virtually unprotected against fraud.andP;  As long distancecarriers beef up their security, and hackers find it riskier to defraud them,the hackers are turning to easy pickings in CPE (i.e.andP;  PBX and privatenetwork) fraud.andM;All three major carriers say that companies are responsible for all callsmade from their PBX -- fruadulent or legitimate.andM;As the spokesperson for one carrier explained, since the long distancecarrier can not force their customers to protect their PBXs against fraud,they expect the customers to pay for fraud that does occur.andM;ATandamp;T says it tries &quot;to have a certain amount of understanding and sympathy&quot;the first time a customer isandM;defrauded.andP;  That is, they make cut a deal.andP;   ButandM;if you're hit a second time and you haven't taken precautions, they won't besympathetic.andP;  You'll pay!andM;All three major carriers have fraud prevention programs and are eager toprovide information on the subject to their customers, when their marketingdepartments will allow them.andP;  The carriers will also help you investigate thefraud and prosecute the criminals.andP;  MCI even has an excellent video tape onthe subject.andM;But the police and the courts are often baffled by the &quot;high-tech&quot; nature ofthe crime.andM;NATA is also concerned with CPE fraud and its effects on its members.andP;  It putout a memorandum describing what phone system vendors can do to protectthemselves and their clients from this type of fraud.andP;  In the memo, NATAsGeneral Counsel outlined steps CPE users can take to avoid fraudulent use oftheir DISA or other remote features:andM;1.andP;  Restrict international calls.andP;  International calls are the major sourceof fraud.andP;  If you don't normally make international calls, toll restrictthem.andP;  If your company makes international calls to certain countries, blockcalls to all other countries.andM;You can use the toll restriction features of your PBX to block these calls,or you can talk to your local exchange carrier (LEC) and interexchangecarrier (IXC) about toll restriction services.andP;  Some LECs now offer 011blocking.andP;  (All direct dialed international calls are dialed with the prefix011.)andM;Berman tells us there are no specific countries to watch out for, but notesthat clients of organized phone fraud setups are often recent immigrants withlow-paying jobs and phone fraud is often (but not always) linked with drugs.andM;2.andP;  IXC monitoring.andP;  IXCs could provide monitoring services that would helpyou spot unusual activity on your lines.andP;  Your IXC is probably best equippedto spot fraud.andP;  MCI quickly cuts off your credit card if calling volumesuddenly skyrockets, but the same methods don't work for DISA fraud.andM;NATA is discussing this matter with IXCs and you could add your own pressureby requesting the service yourself.andM;3.andP;  Do your own monitoring.andP;  Many fraudulent calls are usually made quickly.andO;Berman says some hackers systematically distribute personal identificationnumbers (PINs) and access codes when they crack them, and a cracked code canfind its way  to fraudulent users in 35 cities in an hour.andM;But the typical &quot;hit&quot; is done over a long three- or four-day weekend.andP;  Thatweekend can rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent calling.andM;&quot;You should see the egg on the telecom manager's face when he comes back towork the following week and sees the calls made over the weekend.andP;  A realnice 'Welcome Back from Vacation Present!,&quot; says one observer.andM;You should look at your SMDR data often and study it for suspicious callingpatterns.andP;  Be careful, some SMDR data is midleading.andP;  TELECONNECT's own callaccounting package got confused between the number of our DISA trunk (204)and one of Harry's ex tensions -- 204.andM;When TELECONNECT got hit for several thousand dollars of international frauda few months ago, the accounting system seemed to indicate  that people weresneaking into Harry's office on the weekend and making calls.andP;  He put a lockon his door!andP;  The calls still persisted.andP;  Then we figured the problem withDISA.andM;4.andP;  ANI.andP;  Use automatic number identification (ANI) for your 800 numbers.andO;It'll cost you.andP;  But if you're forced to have 800 lines into your DISA, thenbuying ANI is a cheap defense.andP;  Make sure you record the numbers.andM;5.andP;  Turn off DISA at night.andP;  Fraudulent calls are often made late at night orearly in the morning.andP;  Turn off DISA and any other remotely accessiblefeatures during these dangerous hours if the equipment allows it.andP;  Be surethe feature can not be turned back on remotely using a special access code --through your PBX maintenance port.andM;At TELECONNECT we have turned our DISA off completely.andP;  And since our switchdoesn't have a remote diagnostics port (it barely has local diagnostics) ourDISA can't be turned back on remotely.andM;Also, we gave everyone their own MCI credit cards.andP;  Since we don't have any24-hour leased lines, there's really no reason for anyone for anyone to useour DISA port to dial long distance.andM;6.andP;  Keep secure access codes.andP;  Use as many digits in your code as you can.andO;Have someone in your company test the password for hack-ability.andP;  Are digitsrepeated?andP;  (999999) Does anything else make it too easy to crack?andM;Change your codes frequently.andP;  Change them every 30 days.andP;  Warn youremployees about sharing their access codes.andP;  Purge the codes of formeremployees and change any access codes known by former employees.andP;  Beespecially wary of disgruntled employees, but apply this rule to alldeparting employees.andM;Make sure your vendor guards any access codes it has for entering your systemfor remote service.andM;Remember, it is not only kids you have to watch out for, but trained computerengineers with all the time in the world  (on their computers) to crack yourcode.andM;7.andP;  Use anti-fraud devices.andP;  Look into any anti-fraud devices that might beeffective.andP;  Voice recognition will cut down on fraud in the future, saysBerman, but until then take advantage of the devices already on the market.andM;TELECONNECT has an electronic bulletin board.andP;  The software costs severalhundred dollars.andP;  When you log on, it asks  you for your password.andP;  If youget  your password wrong three times, it cuts you off.andP;  Dead in the water .andM;Most PBX DISA access ports allow you to stay on and make as many tries as youwant.andP;  And that's comething a personal computer is very good at.andP;  HAckers getinto your Disa, start the program and go to sleep.andP;  Next morning theirpersonal computer screen shows the &quot;hits&quot; -- the codes that worked .andM;And what's even better is that you paid for the call -- on your 800 line.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
