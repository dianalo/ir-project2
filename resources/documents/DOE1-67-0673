<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-0673 </DOCNO><TEXT>In Part I - Theory, a number of surface subsidence mechanisms were identifiedon the basis of elastic theory. Some of these were illustrated by fieldresults. In Part II actual behaviour is compared to theoretical behaviour.NSW subsidence data are evaluated in the light of subsidence mechanismsand empirically derived design curves are critically evaluated. Rockmechanics principles which govern mine design for both controlling surfacesubsidence and ensuring local and regional stability of workings arediscussed in Park III. 13 refs., 20 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
