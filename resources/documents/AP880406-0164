The delegation from the Senate Committee on Energy and NaturalResources, led by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., met with deputyPolitburo member Pyotr Demichev, Col.-Gen. Nikolai Chervov andacademician Yevgeny Velikhov for discussions centered on securityand improving trust between the two superpowers.   A Tass news agency account of the meeting said the Sovietparticipants outlined proposals for spurring the Vienna-based talkson conventional arms reductions, but said the U.S. government hadalready rejected the ideas.   ``We told them there is no support in Congress for beginningconventional arms control until the meeting in Vienna finishes withgood results,'' said Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.   He referred to the European human rights forum that has beenunable to produce a plan for improving individual freedoms in the35 member nations, including the United States and the Soviet Union.   But Wirth said the senators found a greater willingness on theSoviets' part to work toward improvements in superpower relationsand further arms control measures.   Tass said Demichev claimed a treaty eliminating half of bothnations' strategic nuclear weapons could be completed in time forthe next summit between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev``given mutual desire.''   However, Soviet officials have conceded privately that time isrunning short before the May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow and majordifferences persist on the issue of Reagan's space-based missiledefense system.   The Soviets contend the project violates the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile Treaty signed by both nations. Demichev reiterated theKremlin line that any pact on strategic weapons cuts would have toadhere to the ABM agreement.   Velikhov restated the Kremlin's desire to jointly work outmeasures for monitoring and verifying the disarmament process,according to the Tass report.   Wirth said the delegation told the Soviets they would like tosee detailed proposals on how they propose to ensure compliance inthe event an accord is signed in the future banning nuclear testingor use of commercial space vehicles to bring weapons into thecosmos.   The other senators accompanying Johnston and Wirth are KentConrad, D-N.D.; Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.; BobGraham, D-Fla.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; FrankMurkowski, R-Alaska; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; and Paul S. Trible, R-Va.</TEXT></DOC>
