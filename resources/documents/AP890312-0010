No Israeli soldiers were hurt in the fighting, an armyannouncement said.   It was the third confrontation between Israeli soldiers andguerrillas in south Lebanon since February 23. The two otherincidents were described by Israel as PLO attempts to carry outattacks inside Israel and became an issue in the U.S. dialogue withthe PLO.   An army announcement referred to the guerrillas as ``terrorists''but did not indicate if they were Palestinian or Lebanese. Aspokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she had noinformation on whether the guerrillas were trying to infiltrate intoIsrael.   The confrontation in Lebanon took place near the town of Hasbaya,about five miles north of the Israeli border, the army said.   Hasbaya is within the security zone set up by Israel to protectits northern border in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forcesfrom Lebanon after a three-year occupation.   Seven Palestinian guerrillas were killed in the two earlierbattles, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, aMarxist faction of the PLO, said they were members of their group.   One confrontation took place on Feb. 23, and the second was onMarch 2.   Israel accused the Palestinian group of trying to infiltrate intoIsrael in the two previous confrontation and called on the UnitedStates to halt its dialogue with the PLO, saying PLO chief YasserArafat had broken his pledge to stop terrorist attacks.   U.S. officials criticized the PLO for the incidents, but it alsocalled for a halt to retaliatory Israeli bombing raids againstPalestinian positions in south Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
