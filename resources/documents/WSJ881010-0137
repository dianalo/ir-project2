In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it bought its International Genetic stock as an investment. It has had informal talks with a member of the company's management on getting a seat on the board. It initiated the talks &quot;in the ordinary course of its business,&quot; the filing said, and not for the purposes of seeking control. The group now wants to &quot;formally communicate&quot; with the company's board, the filing said.    In Santa Monica, Calif., Arup Sen, vice president of International Genetic, said the biotechnology company had just received the Atalanta Selective filing and hadn't yet studied it.    According to the filing, the group holds 658,029 International Genetic common shares, including 86,000 shares bought from Aug. 17 to Sept. 28 for $4.625 to $5 each.    The group said it may buy more shares in the open market, in private transactions, by tender offer, or &quot;otherwise,&quot; the filing said. But it didn't rule out disposing some or all of its holdings.    Other group members are Mark Newman, a New York investor, and Atalanta Investment Co., a New York investment firm.    In national over-the-counter trading, International Genetic closed Friday at $4.625 a share, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
