In a 2-1 ruling, the panel said Nofziger's 1988 conviction must``be set aside because it is not based on a finding that he hadknowledge of each element of the offenses'' he was accused ofcommitting.   ``The government was required to prove that he had knowledge ofall of the facts making his conduct criminal,'' said the decisionwritten by U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge James Buckley.Buckley was joined by judge Stephen Williams. Both are Reaganappointees.   Appeals court judge Harry Edwards, a Carter administrationappointee, dissented, saying there was ``no basis for overturningNofziger's conviction.''   Asked at a news conference whether he thought he had gotten offon a legal technicality, Nofziger said, ``Absolutely no. ... I thinkthey came after me on a technicality.''   James McKay, the independent counsel who prosecuted Nofziger,issued a statement saying he ``will consider his options to pursuefurther appellate review of this decision.'' The prosecutor couldseek a review by the entire federal appeals court in Washington orappeal to the Supreme Court.   President Bush and other high level administration officials wereclearly pleased.   Bush, asked at a state dinner honoring Australian Prime MinisterRobert Hawke what he thought of the ruling, smiled broadly and saidonly, ``I'm always glad when soembody is found not guilty ofsomething.''   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was more effusive, callingthe decision ``terrific.''   Vice President Dan Quayle said it was good news and Bush's chiefof staff, John Sununu said he had called Nofziger to congratulatehim and let him know `` at least some of his old friends hadn'tforgotten him.''   The case against Nofziger, President Reagan's White Housepolitical director in 1981, was the first major test of therevolving-door provisions of the Ethics in Government Act. The lawimposes a one-year ban on lobbying former government colleagues oncean upper-echelon employee leaves service in the executive branch.   Nofziger said he was ``certainly pleased'' by the decision. ``Ithink I was innocent from the beginning; I still think I aminnocent,'' he said.   He was convicted Feb. 11, 1988, of three counts of illegallylobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients afterhe left the White House one year into the Reagan administration. Theclients were scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a maritime engineersunion and the manufacturer of the Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane.   Nofziger, who is 65, was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined$30,000. He said that defending himself cost ``a bundle, a bundle,''with legal fees running over $1.5 million and ``I suppose, more thanthat'' in lost income.   As a lobbyist accused of felonies, ``you not only lose clients,you don't get clients.'' But he acknowledged he has been able tokeep his business going while the case made its way through thecourts.   Asked about the ``revolving door'' provisions of the ethics lawunder which he was prosecuted, Nofziger said, ``I don't think I ampart of any revolving door syndrome.''   ``People lobby in this town; the main industry in this townbesides government is lobbying,'' he said.   The ethics law prohibits executive branch officials from``knowingly'' acting as agents or attorneys before their oldagencies within one year after leaving the government.   Nofziger contended the word ``knowingly'' also applied to aprohibition against making ``oral or written communications'' totheir previous government colleagues on matters in which the agencyhad ``a direct and substantial interest'' within one year.Prosecutors said the word ``knowingly'' referred only to acting asan agent or attorney.   ``This is not an idle grammatical inquiry,'' said Buckley'sruling. ``If Nofziger's interpretation is correct, no one may beconvicted ... unless it is proven that he had knowledge of each ofthe facts constituting the offense.''   The court found that the wording was ambiguous.   ``Canons of statutory construction require that an ambiguouscriminal statute be interpreted in the defendant's favor,'' saidBuckley.   The prosecutors never alleged that Nofziger knew his formercolleagues had a direct and substantial interest in the matters onwhich he was lobbying them.   Under the prosecution's theory, ``if an ex-official tries tointerest his former agency in a particular project in the mistakenbelief that it had no `direct and substantial interest' in it, hewill have committed a felony punishable by up to two years injail,'' said Buckley.   In his dissent, Edwards said the law was clear and that the word``knowingly'' didn't apply to the provisions under which Nofzigerwas convicted.   ``The majority has labored mightily to find an ambiguity,'' saidEdwards. But there is no ambiguity to resolve ``and, consequently,no basis for overturning Nofziger's conviction,'' he said.   ``I cannot comprehend my colleagues' convoluted attempts toembrace'' Nofziger's ``fancied ambiguity, and their ... willingnessto ignore clear legislative history and engage in overtlegislating,'' said Edwards.   Buckley and Williams remanded the case to the District Court``for proceedings consistent with this opinion.''   ``The District Court should have dismissed the indictment filedby the prosecution,'' said the decision.   A federal court jury found Nofziger guilty of illegally using hisinfluence by sending an April 8, 1982, memo to then-presidentialcounselor Edwin Meese III.   The memo suggested that Meese enlist the support of PresidentReagan and others to persuade the Army to give a no-bid contract tobuild small gasoline engines to Wedtech, which in the last years ofthe Reagan administration became the focus of a massive federalcorruption probe. While he was attorney general, Meese himself cameunder criminal investigation in connection with Wedtech. He wasn'tprosecuted.   Nofziger also was convicted of sending an Aug. 20, 1982, memo toJames Jenkins, Meese's deputy, urging the administration to putcivilian sailors on Navy vessels. The policy was being pushed by theMarine Engineers Beneficial Association, which paid Nofziger'slobbying firm $100,000 a year.   Additionally, the jury said Nofziger illegally lobbied twoNational Security Council officials about continued production ofthe Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane, which was made by FairchildCorp.</TEXT></DOC>
