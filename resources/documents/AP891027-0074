The 42 officers are assigned to Project Peace Pearl, a $500million program to upgrade Chinese F-8 fighter planes, with Chinaexpected to ultimately buy enhanced aviation electronic technology.   They were taken off the project at Grumman Corp. in Bethpage,N.Y., and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, whenPresident Bush banned high-level contacts with China after theChinese army attacked demonstrators in June, killing hundreds andperhaps thousands in Beijing.   But early this month the Bush administration quietly lifted thesuspension, the Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions.Seven of the Chinese officers who stayed in the United Statesreturned to work Oct. 2, and 18 returned from China to begin workthis week.   ``It was determined by the U.S. government that they areneeded,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman.``You can assume that the decision was fully coordinated by theDefense Department, the State Department, the White House andNational Security Council.''   Project Peace Pearl, which will sell advanced avionics equipmentto the Chinese for the F-8s, is still in the development stage. Thescheduled shipment to China of $500 million in equipment is not dueuntil 1992, but it is undetermined if the sale will go through.   In June, Bush announced a $600 million freeze against Chinawould include the avionics sale, and another $100 million shipmentof military equipment.   On June 5, immediately after Bush proposed the freeze, Grummanofficials told the 40 Chinese nationals not to return to work, butkept 250 Americans assigned to the project on the job, said MariamReid, a Grumman spokeswoman.   Two Chinese military officers working on the project atWright-Patterson were not kicked off the base, but told to stayaway from the project office.   The Air Force oversees the project, which will continue despiteuncertainty about the sale, Lundquist said.</TEXT></DOC>
