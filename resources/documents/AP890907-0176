For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Bush requested $33.5million.   ``We'll always be looking for opportunties to increase that aidbut we believe certain economic reforms and political reforms arenecessary as a link with any real increases in aid, so we have someassurances that it is, indeed, revitalizing the Polish economy,''said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   He said Bush wrote to congressional leaders and asked for rapidapproval of his request.   In addition to the economic aid, the administration is preparinga $58 million package of food aid for Poland that is expected to beready around Oct. 1. Fitzwater said, ``We want to get all the foodaid in there we can.''   Bush announced the $150 million package during his July trip toPoland and Hungary. Some members of Congress have urged theadministration to expand the package to reward the installation ofSolidarity member Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister of Poland.   The president discussed the package, along with other subjects,with Republican members of Congress during a meeting at the WhiteHouse.   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., who earlier hadrecommended a higher figure, said, ``I think he's doing what heshould do in providing the leadership, working with the Westernalliance.''   Dole said ``the bottom line is ... it's primarily theresponsibility of Poland.''   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., said he recommended to Bush thathe name a task force of American businessmen, labor leaders andothers to work with Poland's government to identify the reforms itshould adopt ``to get from a communist economic base to a moreproductive base.''   Fitzwater said the idea is being considered.   In July, Bush said he would provide Poland with $100 million tospur private enterprise and $15 million for environmental projects.Hungary is to receive $25 million for entrepreneurial projects and$5 million for environmental projects. Bush also requested $5million to promote organized labor.</TEXT></DOC>
