We show that in general the Casimirenergy depends on a normalization scale. This phenomenon has relevanceto applications of the Casimir energy in bag models of QCD. Within theframework of Kaluza-Klein theories we discuss the one-loop correctionsto the induced cosmological and Newton constants in terms of a Casimirlike effect. We can calculate the dependence of these constants on theradius of the compact dimensions, without having to resort to detailedcalculations.</TEXT></DOC>
