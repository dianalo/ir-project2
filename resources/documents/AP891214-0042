The finding of this ``super greenhouse effect'' over the westerntropical Pacific Ocean is a cause for concern, said co-authorVeerhabdran Ramanathan.   If it occurs because the water there has surpassed somethreshold temperature, the Earth's overall warming may accelerateas more of its water warms beyond that temperature, said theUniversity of Chicago climatologist.   But its cause is not known and its implications for the futurecannot yet be assessed, he said in a telephone interview.   In the greenhouse effect, the atmosphere traps some energyradiating from Earth rather than letting it all escape into space.With buildup of certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbondioxide, more energy is trapped, resulting in a global warming ofclimate.   Ramanathan said results of his study are consistent withpredictions that a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide will leadto a warming of about 4 degrees Fahrenheit.   He and graduate student Ameet Raval present the work in today'sissue of the British journal Nature.   They measured the amount of trapped energy by comparing seasurface temperatures to the amount of energy escaping into space,as measured by satellites. The readings were taken during 1985 and1986.   They found that the higher the sea temperature, the more energywas trapped in the atmosphere above.   Analysis gave ``compelling evidence'' for existence of a naturalprocess that amplifies atmospheric warming caused by other factors,the authors wrote. The effects of such a process are incorporatedin current computer models used to study the greenhouse effect.   Essentially, the process is that as the sea surface and air getwarmer, the atmosphere accumulates more water vapor. The extravapor traps more energy radiating from the Earth, leading tofurther atmospheric warming.   The Nature paper is the first ``really decent'' demonstration ofthis process, commented Robert Cess of the State University of NewYork at Stony Brook, who wrote an accompanying editorial.</TEXT></DOC>
