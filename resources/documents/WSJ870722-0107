There was a viva, it seemed, for almost every demandand ideal bottled up within this country's disenfranchisedblack population.   When the last viva had been shouted, and the last clenched fist waved, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, known as Cosatu, had firmly, and defiantly, positioned itself at the front of the black opposition movement in South Africa. The convention completed a metamorphosis of the 750,000-member federation from traditional labor union movement to committed political organization. The bread-and-butter issues of wages and job security were recast to include the toppling of the government, the installation of black-majority rule and the creation of a socialist economy.    &quot;Politics, and especially the lack of even the most basic democratic rights for the majority of our people, is a bread-and-butter issue for the working class,&quot; says Elijah Barayi, Cosatu's president. &quot;It is the fundamental question which is tormenting millions of workers -- and we are obliged to answer it.&quot;    Cosatu's answer -- a resounding viva -- has put South Africa's black union movement, with a total membership of nearly two million, on a collision course with a government determined to keep black politics out of labor relations. It has also pushed the country's factories and mines to the front line of the anti-apartheid struggle, where they are replacing the schools and streets of the black townships as the flashpoints of confrontation.    &quot;The conflict in South Africa is shifting from the townships to the shop floors,&quot; says Tom Lodge, a specialist in black politics at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand.    This shift began with the imposition 13 months ago of the state of emergency, under which many township leaders have been detained or driven underground and their organizations crippled. As a result, political emotions have been channeled into the unions, which remain one of the few legal outlets of black grievances.    This politicization of the unions elevates South Africa's crisis to a new level. It raises the specter of a large-scale withdrawal of black labor from a modern economy utterly dependent on black sweat and skills. Any such action would be a much greater shock to South African society than scattered unrest in the townships.    Also, the introduction of politics to the factory floor threatens to upset the country's delicate labor-relations system, which has evolved into South Africa's only model of genuine black-white power sharing.    &quot;We have developed a sophisticated industrial-relations system in this country,&quot; says Bokkie Botha, the personnel manager of AECI Ltd., South Africa'a largest chemical concern. &quot;To interfere with it would be extremely dangerous.&quot;    As the emerging center of black power, the labor movement has become the focus of persistent pressure by the state. Since the state of emergency was imposed more than a year ago, 3,000 union officials have been detained, union meetings have been banned, and Cosatu's headquarters was bombed and burned during a transport workers strike in May.    But unlike locally based organizations that were quashed with the removal of their leaders, Cosatu's enormous size -- it represents 13 industrial unions, including the National Union of Mineworkers, the country's biggest -- and its organizational structure have insulated it from the state's wrath. Indeed, it has even retaliated by orchestrating a couple of mass walkouts with other union federations.    &quot;The government is out to crush us,&quot; says Jay Naidoo, Cosatu's general secretary. &quot;But the workers will die to defend their organizations.&quot;    This isn't the way the government figured things would turn out when it granted legal recognition to black unions in 1979. Pretoria's intention was to open up a relief valve for emotions that had erupted in a wave of illegal strikes by black workers in 1973 and then in the violent uprising of Soweto students in 1976.    But over the years, this strategy soured. &quot;As long as blacks have no other channels for expressing political aspirations they will use the unions to do so,&quot; says Johann Liebenberg, chief negotiator for the country's mining companies.    They used that channel with a vengeance during the Cosatu convention. The meeting hall was overflowing with the pent-up emotions of South Africa's blacks. &quot;We produce the wealth of South Africa, yet we are victims of a brutal and exploitative system of apartheid and capitalism,&quot; shouted Mr. Barayi, Cosatu's president. &quot;Viva!&quot; the delegates thundered back.    The &quot;fraternal greetings&quot; of the banned African National Congress, which seeks the violent overthrow of the government, were welcomed with cheers. So, too, was the telegram from the South African Communist Party.    The delegates unanimously adopted the Freedom Charter, a 1955 document synonymous with the ANC that calls for the nationalization of major industries and a redistribution of land. They also endorsed closer ties with the United Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheid political group.    The plunge into politics was complete and irrevocable. But it isn't without risks. Some unionists worry that political alliances, such as affiliation with the United Democratic Front, will jeopardize the unions' independence in a post-apartheid South Africa. &quot;We must ensure that the post-apartheid unions are free, independent and democratic,&quot; says Phiroshaw Camay, the head of the National Council of Trade Unions, the country's second largest trade federation. &quot;We don't want to become the transmission belts of a one-party state.&quot;    But Cosatu officials argue that under the state of emergency, the unions can't afford the luxury of setting their own agenda. The &quot;struggle&quot; comes first.    The government believes the unions are being manipulated by revolutionaries. &quot;It is a disturbing fact that certain trade unions or trade union groups are moving deeper into the political terrain,&quot; says Manpower Minister Pietie du Plessis.    Mr. du Plessis is vague on what measures the government is planning to prevent this. But union leaders are bracing for a clampdown. They also fear a surge in right-wing black vigilante action.    In their confrontation with the government, the unions have a unusual ally: the business community. It isn't that South African employers favor the politicization of the unions; it's just that they have gotten used to negotiating with them.    In an effort to head off a shop-floor showdown, the Federated Chambers of Industries recently sent a memo to the government attacking the notion that &quot;physical force against a few communist agitators and revolutionaries&quot; is the answer.    Rather, the industrial group said, &quot;The importance of strong trade unions and trade union federations, both for economic vitality and democracy, must not be underestimated.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
