The dollar took another dive against most other major currencies.    After seesawing through much of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a loss of 19.54 points at 2641.12 in heavy trading. The prospect of further easing of credit by the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, propelled bond prices higher and drove the dollar lower.    The National Association of Purchasing Management's July survey set the stage for much of the action in financial markets. The survey's index of business conditions in July fell to 46%, indicating that the nation's manufacturing sector contracted for the third consecutive month. The index was the lowest since January 1983.    Stock and bond markets also got a boost from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments that the Fed has apparently been successful in defusing inflation and that the economy remains on course for a &quot;soft landing&quot; -- modest growth with lower inflation and interest rates.    The bond market rally started in overseas trading and gathered steam after the purchasing managers' report was released. At its midday peak, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up more than two points, or $20 for each $1,000 face amount, and the yield was down to 7.76%. But by the end of trading, the bond had given back about a point of that gain and was yielding 7.83%.    Stock prices were even more volatile, fueled as they were by computerized trading tied to stock index arbitrage. They rallied twice during the day, carrying the Dow Jones industrials up as much as 16 points. But the subsequent retreats were harsh, at one point knocking the average down nearly 25 points from its opening level of 2660.66, a post-crash high.    Analysts said the swings reflected uncertainty among investors about the risks and benefits that came with rapidly falling interest rates. &quot;Three months ago, I don't think anyone would have predicted that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond would hit 7.76%,&quot; said Charles Clough, chief portfolio strategist at Merrill Lynch. &quot;That's just an indication of how fast interest rates can fall, and that's unmitigatingly positive for stocks.&quot;    But he also said investors are worried about the outlook for corporate earnings in a declining economy. &quot;The only question {in the} near term is the sustainability of corporate earnings,&quot; he said.    In major market activity:    Stock prices sank in heavy trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 225.3 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 808-729.    Bond prices rallied. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained more than a point.    The dollar fell against most other currencies. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8510 marks and 135.90 yen, compared with 1.8648 marks and 136.95 yen late Monday. </TEXT></DOC>
