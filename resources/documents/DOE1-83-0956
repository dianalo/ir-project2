Thesedisturbances alter the spatial pattern of ecosystem processes that aredynamic components of landscape systems. Recent developments in landscapeecology demonstrate the need to explicitly incorporate pattern-processinteractions when analyzing the response of natural systems to disturbancesover large geographic areas. Since degraded ecosystems are both localand regional problems, it will be necessary to incorporate informationon land cover heterogeneity when addressing the mitigation options andmanagement techniques needed to rehabilitate these land areas.</TEXT></DOC>
