The victim, Francisco Jose Guerrero, was a former presidentialcandidate and served as foreign minister and chief justice of theSupreme Court.   Police said a bodyguard shot to death one attacker and anotherwas wounded. But the military said later one attacker was killedand a Guerrero bodyguard was wounded.   The military said four assailants were involved and blamedleftist guerrillas. No group claimed responsibility.   Witnesses and officials said the attack occurred at 9:40 a.m.and Guerrero, shot once in the throat, managed to drive severalhundred yards to a hospital, where he died.   Rebels and soldiers battled again early Tuesday in the capital'snorthern neighborhoods of Mejicanos and Ciudad Delgado.   After the fighting died down, reporters saw the bodies of eightguerrillas. Government casualties were not reported.   The battle began about 3 a.m. with mortar barrages andmachine-gun and rifle fire. Three helicopter gunships strafedguerrilla positons. Shooting tapered off in midmorning.   Both areas had been scenes of heavy fighting during theoffensive the rebels launched Nov. 11. Most of the rebel forcewithdrew last week but guerrilla patrols had been seen in bothMejicanos and Ciudad Delgado.   It was the first time this week that fighting in the capitalzone was more than brief exchanges of gunfire.   Guerrero, 64, represented conservative landowners in theirsuccessful bid to remove a key phase of the land reform program inthe 1970s.   He was a founder of the National Conciliation Party, thegovernment party during military rule in the 1960s and '70s.   Guerrero served as foreign minister in 1968-71 and ran forpresident in 1984 against Jose Napoleon Duarte, a centristChristian Democrat, who won in a runoff. Guerrero was president ofthe Supreme Court for five years during the Duarte administration.   The Christian Democrats were defeated in an election this yearby the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.   In another development, the rebel high command denied anyconnection with Jennifer Jean Casolo, an American arrested Sundayby police who said they found tons of ammunition buried in thegarden of her home in San Salvador. A broadcast on the rebels'clandestine Radio Venceremos said the rebels deny ``any linkbetween this North American citizen and our vanguards and regardsthis as a vulgar frame-up by the armed forces and the government... as part of their persecution of churches, humanitarianorganizations and everyone else connected with aiding the poor.''   Ms. Casolo, 28, a native of Thomaston, Conn., represented theTexas-based Christian Education Seminars.   Police said the arms were buried by rebels on the grounds of thehouse that Ms. Casolo had rented for three months.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday of Ms.Casolo, ``There are indications of her involvement, that's forcertain.''   Also Tuesday, diplomatic and church sources, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said American Baptist Church missionaryRuth Mooney was arrested, held overnight by Treasury Police andreleased on condition she leave the country.   They said she was arrested Monday in Santa Ana, 35 milesnorthwest of San Salvador, and brought to the capital Mondayevening, where a U.S. consular official met with her at TreasuryPolice headquarters.   President Alfredo Cristiani's government contends mosthumanitarian organizations linked to foreign churches are littlemore than guerrilla front groups.   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said Tuesday in Washington hewas outraged by comments by Bush administration officials.   ``When an American is in legal trouble in another country,particularly a country in which the tradition of equal justice isnot firmly established, the U.S. government ought to eitherpublicly insist on its citizen's innocence or keep its officialmouth shut,'' Dodd said.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Ms. Casolotechnically is being held incommunicado by national police but isbeing allowed regular visits by a U.S. consular officer.   A U.S. Justice Department official said the agency is trying todetermine if Ms. Casolo should be charged with violating theNeutrality Act, which prohibits private U.S. citizens from takingsides in wars where the United States is not involved.   He added U.S. authorities have not eliminated the possibilityMs. Casolo was framed.</TEXT></DOC>
