Filippo Gambina of Middle Village, N.Y., contended that the cashnever came into his possession or control and, thus, that he had noobligation to report it as taxable income.   The court, in a decision made public today, said nothing in the1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act ``indicates that Congressintended that a taxpayer whose property is forfeited should berelieved of the income tax consequences that would have attachedwithout said forfeiture.''   ``Indeed, that history clearly reveals that ... Congressintended to maximize the financial benefit of forfeiture to theUnited States as against third parties who, prior to theforfeiture, had acquired the fruits of the taxpayer's criminalactivities other than in a bona fide transaction,'' the court said.   Freeing a person from having to report such money would have thesame effect as allowing a deduction for the amount _ ``a deductionwhich has been denied on the ground that it would frustrate publicpolicy,'' the court added.   This is the first time the Tax Court has reached such aconclusion, although the U.S. District Court in eastern Louisianamade a similar ruling in another case last March.</TEXT></DOC>
