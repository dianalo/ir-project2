The European Directiveon Emissions has still not been issued. The current position is reviewedwith the expectation that agreement on future European Emission levelscan be reached this year. A survey, comparing costs, performance andeconomy, of catalyst and non-catalyst models sold in European marketsshows the effects on performance and economy to be marginal, while initialpurchase costs are modest. The simple fitment of catalysts on small cars,less than 1.4 litres, has shown that emission levels approaching US limitscan be achieved without additional fuel management costs.</TEXT></DOC>
