Gupta President and CEO Gupta Technologies, Inc.andM;I predict significant growth in database server use on PC LANs, replacingtraditional minicomputers systems.andP;  I see a significant increase in graphicaluser interfaces for database applications rather than the traditionalcharacter-mode user interfaces.andP;  And I predict the emergence of a new classof PC DBMSs intended for Microsoft Windows and OS/2 Presentation Managerplatforms.andP;  They'll be capable of operating as stand-alone DBMSs and as frontends to SQL database servers.andP;  It's going to be exciting in 1990.andM;Adam Green dBASE/FoxPro t rainer and authorandM;1990 will be the year when the dBASE market finally returns to life.andP;  Thedecisive factor in the recent collapse was the dramatic drop in new dBASE&quot;project starts.&quot;andP;  When dBASE IV was announced, users decided to put newapplications on hold until its release.andP;  After evaluating dBASE IV Version1.0, most users decided to wait until a reliable version was delivered.andP;  Inthe meantime, so few new dBASE projects were started that sales foreverything related to dBASE plummeted.andM;I'm confident that Ashton-Tate won't ship dBASE IV version 1.1 until it'saccepted by beta testers as a solid product.andP;  When it ships in 1990, thepent-up demand for new dBASE applications will be released, causing a surgein new projects.andP;  This rising tide will lift the entire dBASE industry,including add-on publishers, corporate and independent developers, and, Ihope, even writers and teachers.andM;The other major development will be a tremendous growth in Fox Software'sshare of the dBASE market.andP;  FoxPro is the most exciting version of the dBASElanguage I've ever used.andP;  I watched from close range as Lotus 1-2-3 took onand defeated VisiCalc.andP;  It looks like Ashton-Tate's greatest challenge in1990 will be to keep history from repeating itself.andM;Michael Gardner V.P., Research and Development WordTech Systems, Inc.andM;dBASE IV clones from several vendors will save Ashton-Tate's bacon bypreserving an interest in dBASE, even in the face of encroachment fromBorland and Microsoft.andP;  Non-developer dBASE IV 1.1, without connected SQLsupport, will finally shape up by the second quarter.andP;  At that point, thedBASE IV language will become the standard level of dBASE, although SQLServer and the Professional Compiler editions of dBASE IV won't be out untilthe fourth quarter--at the earliest.andP;  Standardization on dBASE IV syntax willpressure Nantucket to make Clipper more dBASE IV-compatible.andP;  The firstclient-server dBASE applications, using embedded SQL in dBASE, will beavailable before the year is up.andM;Mini and mainframe hardware vendors will face financial pressure from thesupermicro developers.andP;  The dominant minicomputer DBMS products will weaken.andO;dBASE will grow as a cross-platform migration language and be acceptedgrudgingly by MIS, with products available for Macintosh, UNIX, VAXs, andmainframes, and with robust SQL interfaces.andP;  Computer Associates'pseudo-dBASE product will establish a beachhead for the first &quot;real&quot; dBASEmainframe implementation, which will eventually make a fortune.andP;  In the PCdatabase server arena IBM's OS/2 EE will show itself to be a true contender.andM;Ken Sawyer Sequiter Software, Inc.andM;The dBASE community can expect to see 286/386 specific tools.andP;  These toolswill use DOS Extender technology, harnessing the protected mode capabilitiesof the 286/386.andM;DOS Extenders let programs access all available memory in 286/386 computers.andO;Most PC products are developed in C, and C programmers are now using DOSExtenders to increase their programs' abilities.andP;  DOS Extender technology isnow supplied by a number of companies, so you can expect an explosion in286/386 specific software.andM;Expect Ashton-Tate to market a 286/386 specific version of dBASE IV.andP;  If anyproduct ever cried out for more memory, it's dBASE IV.andM;Clipper programs will grow.andP;  Nantucket will soon realize that most Clipperprograms are run on 286/386 machines and need a DOS Extender option.andM;What about Fox Software?andP;  You may notice from the FoxPro ads that the FoxProinterface looks like Microsoft Windows.andP;  Microsoft Windows 3.0 will run inprotected mode and will provide a future version of FoxPro with all thememory it needs.andM;Lots of memory is the key to performance in database management applications.andO;Make sure you buy 386, with extra memory.andP;  Then get ready for the comingsoftware.andM;Martin Rinehart Board of Directors, WallsoftandM;SQL-based servers will be benchmarked against Clipper and FoxBASE+, helpingspur sales for Clipper and FoxBASE+, not SQL-based servers.andM;FoxPro's user interface will make us all rethink our applications.andP;  We'llwrite in Clipper and C to duplicate them.andM;The Clipper 5.0 language preprocessor will bring out additions to thelanguage like mushrooms after a rain.andP;  It'll be enthusiastically cloned inPerrysburg, Ohio.andM;&quot;For-alike&quot; libraries for Clipper will boom, as will template sets to makethem easier to use.andP;  Templates will generate over half the application codeinstalled--though they'll be used by less than 10 percent of the developers.andO;An established CASE vendor will bring out a major new template product.andM;Ashton-Tate will scramble to reposition themselves as a full-line softwarevendor.andP;  WordPerfect will take firm command of the third position--behindMicrosoft and Lotus.andP;  Attempts to rescue dBASE IV will fail, and encouragedby Ashton-Tate's weakness, Lotus and Microsoft will ship bit-mapped,object-oriented DBMS contenders.andP;  We'll be impressed, but continue writingtext-mode code in our familiar dialects.andM;Computer Associates will make a major acquisition for extending its Cbaseproduct line to smaller computers.andP;  Oracle will completely revamp itsadvertising, but not its product.andM;It will get harder, but those who keep up with the technologies of the '90swill have very happy New Years.andM;C.andP;  Wayne Ratliff Ratliff Software Products, Inc.andM;If Ashton-Tate doesn't self-annihilate during 1990 and if Fox and A-T don'tdestroy each other with litigation for a few years, I think that the dBASElanguage will firmly reside in the Number One spot for at least 10 years.andO;SQL will be a well-financed second or third contender during all of dBASE'sreign, unless the SQL &quot;standard&quot; is enlarged to handle record-oriented accesswith bi-directional cursor movement and absolute record positioning.andM;Network-oriented database operations will grow continuously.andM;As PCs get faster (into the hundreds of megahertz), mainframes will eitherdisappear or become a super disk controller for corporate databases andpublicly accessible databases.andP;  We'll soon see bulletin board services thatare database engines/servers that you can attach to and do databaseoperations directly.andM;Karen Watterson Contributing EditorandM;What'll we see in 1990?andP;  Borland's Paradox and the dBASE work-alikes willcontinue to gain market share in the PC DBMS arena at dBASE's expense.andP;  Filemanagement programs, like Symantec's Qandamp;A, will become more sophisticated(read multi-file-capable), even as high-end DBMSs, like R:BASE, borrow theuser-friendly QBE-type interface from their lower-end counterparts.andM;1990 won't be the Year of the LAN, any more than past years.andP;  But we'll seemore organizations and workgroups get LANs on-line and struggle to adaptexisting single-user database applications.andP;  Organizations with LANs willlook at OS/2-based LANs and think more about interconnectivity.andP;  We'll beinundated by seminar announcements about distributed processing, cooperativeprocessing, strategic information systems planning, LANs, and databaseservers.andM;We'll see more pilot projects that test PC-based database servers' downsizingsuitability, i.e.andP;  projects where minicomputer applications are &quot;downsized&quot;to run on PCs.andP;  Concurrently, those responsible for PC-based databaseapplications running intl LAN bottlenecks will be forced to consider howtheir systems can be integrated into their organization's overall informationresources.andP;  CIOs and their kind will continue to gain prestige as firms beginto realize the importance of information as an organizational resource.andM;Database and data communications specialists will start ecognizing the needfor collaboration, and we'll see more and more cross-training--both formaland informal.andM;Finally, let's just roll over those predictions I made last year: moreobject-oriented programming and object-oriented database management systems(OOPs and OODMBSs), more experiments with computer-aided software engineering(CASE) tools, and more adopting OS/2.andP;  No, 1990 won't be the year of OS/2,but it may be the year of Windows!andM;John L. Hawkins Contributing EditorandM;1990 may be the Year of the Showdown.andP;  Is FoxPro as good as it seems?andP;  WillNantucket Future Technology carry Clipper into brave new worlds?andP;  Can Borlandconvince developers that Paradox isn't just for users?andP;  And Ashton-Tate(remember them?)--will they finally show the world the Right Stuff?andP;  Will theworld care?andM;Splitting database front and back ends will become a major issue  Developerswill choose a database programming language, then mate it with a range ofdatabase management engines running locally or on network servers.andP;  It'lleven be possible to use several different front ends simultaneously.andP;  Aprogrammer might write applications in dBASE, FoxPro, Clipper, Paradox,ORACLE, and Vulcan, plus several spreadsheet products.andP;  These applicationswill talk to data stored and manipulated by Novell's NetWare SQL, Oracle'sSQL engine, Wayne Ratliff's Emerald Bay, the Sybase engine used byAshton-Tate, Gupta's SQL product, plus the native engines of dBASE, FoxPro,and others.andP;  This won't happen overnight, but 1990 will be the year the majorplayers recognize this inevitability.andP;  No one product or company can dominateor supply all the pieces of the solution.andP;  Instead, each firm will define itsturf and begin building the bridges and interfaces.andM;VARs face a series of challenges in 1990.andP;  Competition for customers willintensify.andP;  Major retail chains, recognizing the value consultants provide,will try to become VARs.andP;  They may not be qualified, but customers can'talways tell until it's too late.andP;  Developers will be challengedintellectually and economically by ever more sophisticated database products,environments, and hardware.andP;  The price tag to remain in theVAR/developer/consultant game will go up significantly, forcing many peopleto gear up or get out.andP;  The one-man shop will truly die.andM;On the other hand, vertical and custom software will become even moreimportant as users seek focused solutionsandM;rather than computer &quot;experiences.&quot;andP;   FewerandM;people will tolerate learning curves.andP;  Instead, they'll expect the computerto speak their language, walk them through each step, and be so obvious thata computer-phobe can do it.andP;  For superior programmers, developmentopportunities will abound.andM;Steve Hochschild Manager of Product Marketing Novell Development ProductsDivisionandM;Short version:andM;More, bigger, better, faster.andM;Long version:andM;We'll see more applications addressing bigger problems using betterdevelopment tools running faster on tougher problems.andP;  Because LAN-basedsystems can address the problems of corporate America, the developmentcommunity will start attacking these opportunities.andM;The growth of the network computing market will continue, aided by theincreasing awareness among developers of the amazing power available to them.andO;I believe developers in 1990 will look up from their keyboards and see thepossibilities awaiting them.andM;R.andP;  Russell Freeland Contributin EditorandM;Once again I look into my crystal ball...hold it a minute, gotta reboot thisthing.andP;  Ah!andP;  There it is, 1989.andP;  But wait a minute, we're looking for 1990.andO;Hmmm...this could be a prediction of sorts.andP;  I think the crystal ball istrying to tell me that we may finally see some of 1989's softwareannouncements realized in 1990.andM;Or maybe it's hinting that 1990 will be more of the same hype, vapor, andsmoke we saw in 1989!andP;  After all, last year I predicted we'd see some realdBASE compilers.andP;  Between announced EXE compilers from Fox Software, Apex,and even a new announced version from Nantucket, I expected to see somethingnew.andP;  But nooooo.andP;  What's encouraging is that some of the developers writingthe new software don't seem to care what the announced dates are.andP;  Good forthem.andP;  I'd rather wait until they're ready.andM;I see a lot that won't change.andP;  My favorite game show will still be RemoteControl, and I'll still drink too much at COMDEX.andP;  Scads of people willcontinue to be offended by my columns.andP;  Ed Esber and Dave Fulton willcontinue bowling together on Tuesdays...whoops, I think this thing has hung.andM;Wait, here's something new!andP;  dBASE language versions will proliferate acrossmany operating systems and hardware platforms.andP;  And they'll all bedifferent--just what I needed.andP;  FoxPro will never be totally compatible withdBASE IV, and Clipper 5.0 will proudly hold on to its incompatibility withevery other dBASE version.andP;  Third-party vendors will really have a balltrying to support d'Tower of Babel.andM;Of course, dBASE language products won't be the only divergent technology.andO;We've been living in an IBM DOS world for so long, that we take standards forgranted, but even the DOS standard is starting to unravel.andP;  That may be agood thing.andP;  Before things can come together, sometimes they need to fallapart.andP;  (Case in point is my psyche, or at least I hope so.)andP;  But guess who'sgoing to be paying more for software in 1990?andP;  Ahhhh, that's right.andP;  Softwarepublishers will spend more to develop for several different platforms.andP;  Ionly hope that the users who end up paying for all this get a reasonablereturn on their money.andM;Let's face it gang.andP;  We're spoiled.andP;  We've been living in a &quot;golden age&quot; ofmicrocomputers for too long, and the next phase is about to begin.andP;  What itis I can't say, but it won't be easy making the transition.andP;  This begins theend of stability, at least for a while.andP;  Keep a stiff upper lip and kiss therelative good times goodbye.andP;  Save some affectionate farewells for our otherold friends: the 640K barrier, eyestrain from crummy monitors, ridiculous DOSfiling conventions, lousy sound effects, and version 1.0 of almost everythingyou tried last year.andM;Stephen G. Perry Chairman Revelation Technologies, Inc.andM;1990 will be the year that Lotus, Microsoft, and Ashton-Tate don't bringtheir SQL Server front-end to market.andP;  It'll be the year that VARs,integrators, and Corporate America look to other vendors for front-endsolutions.andM;The qualifications for front ends will be availability, first and foremost.andO;Functionality, completeness of SQL implementation, and the variety of serverssupported will be secondary.andP;  The players in 1990's market will be thosevendors offering complete solutions, that not only provide access to SQLServer, but also a complete development environment that actually enhancesSQL Server's power.andP;  A requirement for development environments is that theybe both database and dialect independent, dictionary driven, and compliantwith existing applications.andM;1989 proved to be the year of the hype.andP;  We learned that SQL servers were thesolution to all our problems.andP;  In 1990 we'll learn that they're only half ofthe solution.andP;  We also learned that SQL can lead to nightmares and that thebest solution will be to hide SQL from all but the most masochistic among us.andO;1989 brought us intrepid explorers building applications using SQL and SQLServer.andP;  The new year will see a new requirement added to the list for DBMSs:They must be an environment suitable for prototyping.andM;Products that offer variable length fields, access to diverse back ends andfile formats, and a complete development environment, will be the DBMSs thatexperience growth in the marketplace in 1990.andM;Larry Heimendinger President, and Chief Operating Officer Nantucket Corp.andM;There will be an outbreak of PM applications, but a true OS/2application--one taking advantage of the operating system--is still a wayoff.andP;  Why?andP;  Because there's no apparent foundation to build a comprehensiveapplication on.andP;  No database, communication, or network facilities haveemerged as an apparent--much less an installed--leader or standard.andM;What comes are tools--personal use tools such as advanced word processing,DP, and graphics tools--and tools making the job of interfacing with acomplex operating environment easier.andP;  These will come from big names, oldnames, and new names.andP;  They'll focus on being tools for specific technologiesrather than new, more sophisticated approaches to tackling problems.andM;Notable expections are Mitch Kapor and Steve Jobs, for example--but you don'tsee them pumping out OS/2 PM products.andM;David F. Hull President andamp; Ceo MicrorimandM;1990: Glasnost for customers, total war among DBMS developers.andM;1.andP;  At large computing sites, the iron curtain between professionalapplications developers and non-technical users will continue to fall.andO;Leading MIS executives, seeking freedom from the confines of last-generationDBMSs, will continue calling for a complete DBMS solution formultiple-platform, enterprise-wide data sharing.andP;  It will have to be usableby operating managers, and non-technical users as well as by professionalapplications developers.andM;2.andP;  The DBMS wars will be more action-packed and interesting to watch.andP;  Thechanges in market share among DBMS developers begun during 1989 willaccelerate.andP;  Among DBMS companies, technical excellence will ascend inimportance as a success factor, while marketing and sales decline (but willcertainly still be important).andP;  A next generation of graphical-user-interfaceDBMSs, this time sporting real power under the hood, will beintroduced--blowing the minds of Data Based Advisor readers and other leadingpower users.andM;3.andP;  Because of No.andP;  2, trying to build applications for OS/2 PM will becomeworthwhile (and fun).andP;  OS/2 will gain many ardent supporters.andM;4.andP;  The Microsoft/Ashton-Tate/Sybase SQL Server alliance (the attemptedpublic relations OPEC of the DBMS world), will leak like a sieve and maycollapse (at least for Ashton-Tate).andM;5.andP;  Microsoft's internal DBMS development project, Omega, will--again--notbear first-customer-ship fruit during 1990.andP;  Other big-names not already inthe business but attempting internal DBMS development efforts willcontinually be frustrated with their inability to jump aboard the DBMSdevelopment train, last clocked at 500 miles per hour.andM;6.andP;  Microrim will ship its next-generation DBMS, Vanguard (formerly known byits code name, Atlas).andM;Eric Kim V. P., Database Division Ashton-TateandM;PC database systems in the 1990s will be driven by three fundamental forces:andM;1.andP;  The need to improve user and application development productivity,reducing software development cost.andM;2.andP;  The need to manage large volumes of multiple data types, media, andobjects.andM;3.andP;  User demand to transparently access and more efficiently processenterprise-wide data.andM;As a result, the 1990s will focus on leveraging data and applicationinvestments in products like dBASE III PLUS while using more productive userand application development tools like dBASE IV and beyond.andP;  To develop in4GLs like dBASE, in a more cost-efficient PC environment, then porting toheterogeneous operating systems will be critical to reducing costs--allowingeasier,  more productive data management.andM;Future database systems will embrace graphics interfacing with new metaphors,providing greater ease of use and development, while managing multi-mediasystems with built-in intelligence--thus preserving integrity in an openarchitecture.andP;  The client/server architecture will be preferred for accessingworkgroup and corporate data, forcing minis and mainframes toward serverstatus in an heterogeneous enterprise-wide system.andM;The ultimate driving force shaping the database future is to provide powe andflexibility to users.andM;Richard L. Schwartz Chief Technical Officer and V. P. Borland InternationalandM;PC database technology in 1990 will be a year of bridges--bridges betweendifferent platforms and different application areas.andM;As the industry starts to deliver products based on common data formats andcommon access methods, there will be more intimate connections andinformation sharing.andP;  We'll begin to see this kind of synergy in products andproduct families delivered in 1990.andP;  To users, this means the ability toconstruct applications that were previously difficult or impossible.andP;  Userswill tap a variety of tools that work together to solve an oveall problem,using the appropriate tool for each part of the application: a spreadsheetfor data analysis and modeling, a database for storing and manipulatingpersonal and corporate information, or a group appointment scheduling programto coordinate the workgroup--all these working with the same information on aLAN.andM;The trend introduced in 1989 for PC databases to have transparent access toSQL databases on larger mini and mainframe platforms will reach the level ofcorporate testbed in 1990.andP;  With the capabilities delivered by the databasevendors, corporate customers will begin to explore cooperative processingapplications.andP;  We'll recognize the benefits of a blanced approach: havingsome data and some processing occur on both PC workstations and the server.andM;Jeffrey B. Tash Database Decisions A Division of Hewitt AssociatesandM;This is the year that SQL databases will become ubiquitous on desktops.andP;  LANinstallations and the emergence of cooperative processing will segment thesoftware marketplace into two parts: front-end clients and back-end servers.andO;The main advantage of client/server processing is the synergy created bymergin RDBMSs with LANs.andM;By the end of 1990, there will be scores of front-end products on the market.andO;Most PC DBMS vendors will become primarily client suppliers, as will vendorsof spreadsheets, graphics, report writers, 4GLs, CASE, natural language, etc.andM;The server market will evolve into a market controlled by a few vendors.andP;  Thethree best positioned products are OS/2 EE, SQL Server, and ORACLE.andO;Virtually all popular client software will support all three.andP;  Other possiblewinners include: CA:DB, given Computer Associate's size and mainframemarketshare, SQLBase because of its DOS support, and Ingres, due to itsinstalled UNIX base.andP;  Smaller DBMS companies, including OODBMS VENDORS, areexpected to struggle throughout 1990.andM;Anticipated 1990 product enhancements include improved performance,vendor-defined SQL extension to ease object-oriented development, gateways toforeign databases, distributed transaction management (especially two-phasecommit), and automated snapshot distribution.andP;  Few users will implementdistributed databases in 1990.andM;Richard Ney Director of Marketing Fox SoftwareandM;We think 1990 will bring a distinction between character and graphics modes,as significant as the distinction between hardware platforms and operatingsystems.andP;  Users will choose the operating mode based on their requirementsand preferences: character modes for speed, hardware compatibility and costsavings, and graphics modes for images and proportional type management.andO;We'll see character mode DOS, OS/2, and UNIX, as well as graphics modeimplementations for each (and, or course, the Macintosh).andM;Execuation speed will be even more significant than it is already.andO;Microcomputer-based systems, both stand alone and networked, must handle farlarger files and complex applications.andP;  While advances in hardwareperformance will continue providing incremental improvements, software mustcontinue offering greatly enhanced throughput.andM;We think the market will increasingly recognize that server technologyimpacts two distinct issues: performance and connectivity.andP;  We'll seespecialized server implementation striving to increase throughput, and otherswhich continue the expansion of connectivity across platforms.andM;Finally, 1990 will reconfirm the dominance of database management derivedfrom the dBASE approach.andP;  Innovative implementations from Fox and others willsolidify and validate the dBASE style as the leading database managementapproach for the 1990s and beyond.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
