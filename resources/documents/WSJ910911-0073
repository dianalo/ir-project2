An attorney for the plaintiffs said the lawsuit, filed instate court here, was the first step in an effort to forcethe insurer, American International Group Inc.'s NationalUnion Fire Insurance Co. unit, to help pay any potentialjudgment won by regulators. The attorney said NationalUnion's exposure under a directors and officers liabilitypolicy appears to be about $15 million.</LP><TEXT>   An attorney for National Union declined to comment, and anAIG spokesman didn't have any immediate comment.   The issue arose in July when the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. filed lawsuits in federal court in Houston and Dallasseeking at least $200 million from former officers anddirectors of First RepublicBank's largest banking units,accusing them of contributing to the banks' 1988 collapse.The failure, the most expensive in U.S. history, has cost theFDIC an estimated $2.94 billion.   National Union and another insurer have already paidclaims totaling $19.5 million, primarily to resolvelitigation by investors in First RepublicBank, which isn'trelated to First Republic Bancorp. of San Francisco.   But National Union balked at making pay-outs connectedwith the FDIC lawsuit, arguing that the policy specificallyexcluded claims brought by federal regulators, according toan attorney for the former officers and directors.   In their lawsuit, the former officers and directors alsoseek to have First RepublicBank's insurance broker, Alexanderandamp; Alexander of Texas Inc., a unit of Alexander andamp; AlexanderServices Inc., named liable for potential claims in the eventNational Union isn't forced to pay. An Alexander andamp; Alexanderattorney declined comment.</TEXT></DOC>
