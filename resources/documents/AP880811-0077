The spiritual head of the Church of England met Wednesday nightwith an Iranian Foreign Ministry official, Mohamed Reza SaidMohamedi.   The meeting was the first known direct meeting between Runcieand an Iranian envoy on the fate of Runcie's envoy Terry Waite andother Britons believed held hostage in Lebanon by pro-IranianShiite Moslem extremists.   In a brief statement issued today at Heathrow Airport beforeboarding a flight for a three-week vacation in Philadelphia, Runciesaid:   ``I believe that everyone who is genuinely concerned about theimprovement of Anglo-Iranian relations and about the Britishhostages in Lebanon will recognize that there are times whenprogress can only be made quietly.''   The archbishop refused to elaborate and officials at his Londonresidence, Lambeth Palace, said no further statement would beisssued.   The Iranian Embassy also declined comment and there was no wordon when Mohamedi would leave Britain.   Lambeth Palace officials also would not comment on earlierreports that Runcie and Mohamedi has scheduled several meetings fortoday.   Waite disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying tosecure the release of American hostages held by pro-Iranianextremists.   Mohamedi, a senior official on the European desk of the Iranianforeign ministry in Tehran, helped arrange a visit to the Iraniancapital by four British legislators last month.   The British domestic news agency Press Association said theWednesday night meeting lasted 75 minutes.   The talks come as Britain planned its first diplomatic visit toIran in a year. First Secretary David Reddaway, a senior officialof the British Foreign Ministry, was scheduled to leave for Tehrantoday.   Reddaway will spend three weeks in the Iranian capital assessingthe possibility of a full-scale resumption of diplomatic ties.   A British Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on condition ofanonymity, stressed that Mohamedi's talks in London with Runcie hadnothing to do with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government.   He said they were entirely the affair of church officials.   Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while in Lebanonseeking the release of foreign hostages there.   British television journalist John McCarthy was kidnapped April17, 1986. Brian Keenan _ a teacher from Belfast, Northern Ireland,with dual British and Irish nationality _ has been missing sinceApril 11, 1986.   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, aNew York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claimthey killed him. His body was never found.   There are 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nineAmericans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.   Reddaway, who helped Britons escape from the besieged BritishEmbassy in Tehran in 1980, will report to Mrs. Thatcher'sgovernment on his return to London. Foreign Office Minister LyndaChalker said Monday that it was too early to say if Britain wouldsend an ambassador back to Iran.   Britain closed its embassy and withdrew its ambassador fromTehran in 1980 after revolutionary guards stormed the building.British diplomats then began working out of the Swedish Embassy.   Last summer, Britain all but broke diplomatic relations withTehran after a British diplomat was detained and beaten there inapparent reprisal for British police arresting an Iranian envoy onshoplifting charges.   One Iranian diplomat remains in London.   Last month, Britain and Iran reached a compensation agreement ondamage to the British Embassy and to the Iranian Embassy in London,which was damaged in 1980 during a siege by opponents of AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini.</TEXT></DOC>
