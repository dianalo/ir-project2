 There are myriad scanner typesavailable--flatbeds, sheet-feeds, handheld scanners, and variations on eachkind.andP;  If you've never used a scanner before, how do you select the rightmodel?andP;  Even after you've identified a odel that's most suited to your needs,there can still arise occasions when another scanner would be more suited.andM;Mitsubishi Electronics America must have had this in mind when it developedthe scanner equivalent of the Swiss army knife.andP;  Simply referred to as theHandled Image Scanner, manual operation is only the beginning of theMitsubishi Handheld Image Scanner's features.andP;  With an optional attachment,this functionally designed handheld scanner transforms into a compactsheet-feed model capable of reading a full 8-1/2-by 14-inch document.andM;THE HANDHELD SCANNERandM;Mitsubishi considers its scanner to be a three-in-one model.andP;  First, it's ahandheld scanner with a sleek and easily held body; this basic device retailsfor $995, accompanied by an interface card, cables, and a graphics scanningprogram.andP;  For an additional $260, Mitsubishi sells the attachment that allowsadditional scanner functions; it's a sheet feeder with a flat paper path.andM;The handheld portion snaps right over the top of the sheet feeder's paperentry.andP;  Once assembled, the entire apparatus is a featherweight at 3-1/2pounds and occupies a miniature footprint of 12-1/2 by 8 inches.andP;  The powersuply is completely derived from the interface card at the CPU.andM;The sheet feeder constitutes the second scanner type of the 3-in-1 design.andO;The third scanner type is a flatbed mode, which may not be apparentimmediately.andP;  Basically, it is the feature set these combined products offerthat resembles that typically found on flatbeds.andP;  The flat paper path of thesheet feeder allows heavier card stock to slip through without impairingpaper finish--a benefit of flatbed models.andP;  The use of the handheld portionto scan material from books or other oversize documents is anotherflatbed-type feature.andP;  And for scanning especially delicate items such assingle carbon copies, credit-card receipts, and damaged paper (no problem forflatbed models), Mitsubishi provides a transparent holder to sandwichsensitive documents in prior to scanning.andM;Maximum functionality through minimal design: this theme surrounds theMitsubishi Handheld Image Scanner.andP;  The theme even extends to the productsaccompanying image scanning software.andP;  Installation is truly a matter ofminutes.andP;  The entire program is contained on just one 360K diskette and isinstalled by copying its files to the hard disk.andP;  Normally, this method ofsoftware installation conjures up visions of some crudely written,command-oriented program.andP;  On the contrary: with no further installation, youare presented with an elegant graphical interface of the GEM/Windows genre,complete mouse support, and automatic recognition of expanded memory.andM;It if weren't for the efficient disk/memory caching technique used toexpedite the scanning process, it would be possible to run this applicationon a two-floppy-drive system.andP;  Instead, it will run on a PC, but there mustbe a hard drive with 1.2MB of free space.andP;  Whem momory is available, thesoftware buffers the image as it scans, which produces full-page scan timesremarkably close to the manufacturer's own specification sheet--approximately10 seconds.andP;  Whe additional memory is unavailable, the software willautomatically write the image temporarily to disk as it scans, to simulatethe buffering process.andP;  Even in this case, scan times are not sluggish.andM;IMAGE SOFTWAREandM;The image software supports both PC Paintbrush and TIFF file formats.andO;Graphics editing tools include flip, rotate, erase, and zoom, and alloperations are performed swiftly with both line art and photo imagessupported.andP;  While the software does not recognize gray scales, an automatic16-level dithering process is invoked to simulate them when you choosehalftone as the scanned image format; resolution is automatic and limited to200 dpi (dots per inch).andP;  Output both on-screen and at the printer are quiteacceptable, considering the resolution.andM;No OCR support is currently offered, but the manufacturer does plan toprovide drivers for third-party manufacturers of text-scanning software.andP;  Noproducts hae officially been targeted for this yet, nor have any dates beenannounced.andM;The Mitsubishi Handheld Image Scanner is not the least-expensive scanner onthe market, and without OCR its capabilities are still limited.andP;  But itsattractive and functional design of both hardware and software and its easeof installation and use make it a smart system to consider.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
