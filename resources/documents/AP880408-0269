(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women in sales forces tend to represent astrong portion of housewares, publishing and food productsindustries, but few sell tools, hardware and general machinery, astudy found.   ``Over the past decade, the most significant advances for womenin sales have been in banking, financial services, utilities andpublishing,'' said William O'Connell, head of sales managementpractice for the company that conducted the study, PersonnelCorporation of America.   ``In these industries, where there is no apparent gender-relatedconsumer bias, sheer numbers women have equalled or surpassed theirmale counterparts on the sales force,'' O'Connell said Friday.   The data for the study, conducted earlier this year, came from12,000 salespeople employed by nearly 350 companies representing 40industries.   According to the study, the industries with the greatestpercentage of women in their sales forces are textile and apparel,utilities, banks and financial services, housewares, publishing andfood products.   The industries with the smallest percentage of women in theirsales forces are general machinery, aerospace, transportationequipment, tools and hardware, automotive parts and fabricatedmetal products, the study found.   ``Our hypothesis is that selling such technical items as toolsand hardware requires some engineering and technical background,which statistics have shown, women have not gotten into,''O'Connell said.   But, he said, the sales managers he surveyed indicated thatwomen tend to be better performers in the industries where they areselling.</TEXT></DOC>
