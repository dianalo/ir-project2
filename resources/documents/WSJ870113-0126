Insurance brokers say that leading writers of such insurance, American International Group Inc. and Chubb Corp. among them, have recently increased the size of the policies they will write. A number of companies, too, are entering the market for the first time or increasing their presence in it, including giant Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., which is expected to announce expansion plans today.    By buying several policies, &quot;you can certainly get up to $100 million in coverage for major companies,&quot; about double what businesses could assemble last year from limited supplies, says William K. Brown Jr., a managing director with insurance brokers Marsh andamp; McLennan Inc. in New York.    But the problem isn't over yet. For one thing, most companies still can't find as much directors-and-officers insurance as they had two or three years ago, when a company might have had coverage of $200 million or more. And the newer policies usually include a bevy of added restrictions, such as exclusions for claims related to hostile takeovers. &quot;I think the crisis is still here because of the coverages that are missing from the policies,&quot; says John B. Foley, a vice president with New York-based insurance brokers Alexander andamp; Alexander Services Inc. Moreover, many companies, especially smaller and younger ones, are still unable to find coverage or to afford the policies that are available.    As with other types of liability insurance, an extended price war among writers of coverage for directors and officers helped to make the business unprofitable over the past few years. And even more than in other lines, claims ballooned far beyond expectations. As a result, some insurers stopped writing the policies altogether; others raised premiums as much as tenfold over the past two years.    The ensuing shortage has led groups of businesses to form their own jointly owned insurance companies, which have helped to meet some of the demand.    Meanwhile, one factor enabling insurers to increase policy limits is a greater availability of reinsurance -- essentially, insurance for insurers. A spokeswoman for Warren, N.J.-based Chubb says that higher reinsurance capacity enabled the company to raise its policy limit on Jan. 1 to $25 million from $15 million.    In addition, today's higher premiums are making directors-and-officers coverage more attractive to traditional insurers. Aetna, never a big player in the field, will offer to write policies of up to $15 million for industrial companies, banks and nonprofit organizations. Much of the risk will be assumed by a new reinsurance company formed by Aetna and several institutional investors, with an initial $100 million in capitalization.    John J. Dwyer, an Aetna vice president, says the Hartford, Conn., company plans to offer &quot;modestly broader coverage for a modestly better price.&quot; For instance, the policy doesn't exclude claims related to hostile takeovers.    As Mr. Dwyer's comment suggests, there is some competition stirring among sellers of directors-and-officers insurance. But so far, insurance brokers say, the benefits are being felt only by the largest and financially strongest corporations.    Some of those &quot;very, very top risks&quot; are seeing either small price cuts or a greater willingness among insurers to alter policy terms, says Mr. Foley of Alexander andamp; Alexander. Many other corporations, he notes, will see their premiums for such coverage rise another 10% to 15% this year. (While premiums vary widely, Mr. Foley says most larger companies now pay on average $40,000 to $50,000 a year for each $1 million of coverage.)    Some companies, most of them small or recently formed, have lost outside directors because they couldn't find or afford liability insurance for them. That will probably happen less often in 1987 than in recent years, predicts John M. Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate Directors in Washington, D.C. This, he notes, is largely because Delaware and several other states have modified their laws to make it possible for companies to indemnify directors against certain claims.    Thus, while companies are still expected to seek insurance to cover those potential expenses, they may be able to retain directors when insurance isn't available. Mr. Nash notes, however, that such situations aren't risk free. &quot;That indemnification,&quot; he says, &quot;is only as good as the financial stability of the company.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
