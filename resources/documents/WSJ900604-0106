In a statement, Comfed said that &quot;as is customary withbanks with negative tangible capital,&quot; it expects to receivea report from its auditors expressing doubt about its abilityto continue as a going concern. The company said it issubject to a range of potential regulatory actions that maybe imposed by the Office of Thrift Supervision, includingconservatorship or receivership, which &quot;would likely cause atotal loss of stockholders' investment.&quot;   Comfed attributed the losses to &quot;the continueddeterioration of residential construction, income propertyand mortgage loan portfolios,&quot; and a substantial provisionfor estimated losses on loans. Because the decliningreal-estate market has further eroded the bank's ability torecover its assets, provisions for estimated losses of $42.6million were added during the most recent quarter.   The company also announced that Jefferson F. Allen,chairman, director and chief executive officer of the companyand its subsidiary, Comfed Savings Bank, would resign,effective June 30. The company named Jack Zoeller, presidentof Comfed Savings and Comfed Mortgage Co., to succeed Mr.Allen as president and chief executive of Comfed.   For the full year, Comfed's net loss was $47.9 million, or$5.73 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $3.5million, or 42 cents a share.   The Home National Bank was declared insolvent Friday bythe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, with theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver. The failedbank's 10 branch offices will reopen today as branches ofBayBanks Inc.'s BayBank Middlesex subsidiary, which willassume Home National's $440 million in deposits.   The BayBanks unit has agreed to pay the FDIC a purchasepremium of $2 million. The unit will also purchase HomeNational's cash and securities and will have options to buyother assets later.   To facilitate the transaction, the FDIC said it willadvance the BayBanks unit $350 million and the FDIC willretain Home National assets with a book value of about $380million.   Two weeks ago, Merchants Capital Corp.'s main unit,MerchantsBank of Boston, was declared insolvent and its $340million in deposits assumed by Bank of Boston Corp. And inlate April, federal thrift regulators took control of HomeOwners Savings Bank in Burlington, Mass.   Scores of New England financial institutions have beenwounded by the region's slumping real-estate market, and morefailures are expected.   In a statement regarding Home National, the comptroller'soffice said it noted a &quot;substantial deterioration&quot; in thebank's loan portfolio in 1987, &quot;due to liberal lendingpractices and weak supervision by both the board of directorsand management.&quot;   The statement said, &quot;The OCC obtained a formal commitmentof the board to address the bank's problems. The boardsubsequently replaced management, but a downturn in the localeconomy exacerbated the problems in the bank's loanportfolio.&quot;   The agency said the bank's board attempted to raisecapital as losses mounted, but was unsuccessful. &quot;Lossesfinally exhausted the bank's capital, resulting ininsolvency,&quot; the comptroller's office said.</TEXT></DOC>
