The measure appropriates $680 million more than the presidentrequested. He said it bings the nation $198 million closer totriggering cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.   The measure was the fifth appropriation bill that Reagan hasreceived and signed of the 13 bills Congress annually considers.   ``I urge the Congress to act swiftly to send me the remainder ofthe fiscal year 1989 appropriations bills _ on time and onbudget,'' Reagan said.   Although he said that ``on balance the act merited myapproval,'' the president complained that it once again extendedthe moratorium on granting oil and gas leases for certain areas ofthe outer continental shelf.   ``The Congress increased the damaging effect of the moratoriumby extending it to apply to grants of permits for drilling andexploration activities under leases already granted,'' he said.``For the Congress to prohibit the issuance of such permits tothose who already had obtained leases is unfair.''   Reagan also said that portions of the bill, requiring approvalof congressional committees for such things as changes in ForestService regional boundaries, are unconstitutional.</TEXT></DOC>
