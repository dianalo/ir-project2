Broadbent said.andP;  &quot;It adds costs to every firm bidding, and that ispassed on to the taxpayer.andP;  We need a new philosophy for how we do businessand must eliminate the steps that do not add value.&quot;andM;Broadbent, deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for informationsystems, and several other federal IRM officials voiced their concerns at aprocurement conference in Washington this month sponsored by GovernmentComputer News.andM;Broadbent's continuing criticism of the procurement process has sparked ireon Capitol Hill.andM;Sen.andP;  John Glenn (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Governmental AffairsCommittee, has complained that comments by Treasury officials raisedquestions about the department's commitment to full-and-open competition andcast doubt on the integrity of the protest resolution process andlsqb;GCN, March 4andrsqb;.andM;Nonetheless, in his comments at the GCN conference, Broadbent stuck to hisposition that changes are needed.andP;  Agencies spend too much time trying to getthrough the regulation maze, he said, calling on Congress, the agencies andthe administration to eliminate needless administrative burdens.andM;Broadbent urged GSA's IRM Service to increase the blanket delegation ofprocurement authority, currently $2.5 million.andP;  Such a low threshold meansIRMS must approve most agency purchases and prevents IRMS officials fromconcentrating on  arger, more complex acquisitions, he said.andM;IRMS also should establish an oversight system based more on trust, he said.andO;Agencies should give project managers greater responsibility and training toencourage them to stick with programs, Broadbent said.andM;&quot;We need to force accountability down to the lowest levels.andP;  Lengthy lifecycles and high staff turnover have so diffused the process that it's hard tofind anyone who feels responsibility for a project,&quot; Broadbent said.andM;&quot;There should also be greater focus on long-term strategic planning,&quot; hesaid.andM;Defending the SystemandM;Capt.andP;  Thomas McQueen, commander of the Navy's Information TechnologyAcquisition Center, said numerous regulations stiffle efficiency.andM;Oversight is necessary, but it should be an integral part of the procurementcycle rather than a series of audits conducted at milestones, he said.andM;&quot;Give people a charter for responsibility and hold them accountable,&quot; McQueensaid.andP;  &quot;Put the review people in the trenches, because if they're part of theprocess they'll know how it's working and will not waste time.&quot;andM;Several agency officials also called for revamping the bid protest process atthe GSA Board of Contract Appeals by penalizing protesters who file frivolouscomplaints.andM;But procurement attorneys warned that identifying unwarranted protests is notsimple.andP;  Lt.andP;  Col.andP;  Clarence Long, chief of the Army's bid protest team, saidthe merits of a case are not always evident at first.andM;&quot;I believe that a protester should not pay all costs unless the board findsthat the protester conducted the litigation in bad faith,&quot; Long said.andO;&quot;Legitimate protesters should not be penalized unless the protest isirresponsible.andM;Bad DecisionsandM;Joseph J. Petrillo, a partner in the Washington law firm of Petrillo andamp;Hordell and a GCN columnist, defended the protest system as fair and not inneed of an overhaul.andP;  Despite inconvenient delays, Petrillo said protestshelp keep agencies accountable and prevent bad decisions from being carriedout.andM;&quot;We're expending public funds, and the public expects accountability,&quot;Petrillo said.andM;&quot;It's not perfect, but it's the best system yet to be designed.andP;  We don'twant to go back to pre-Competition in Contracting Act days when the GeneralAccounting Office gave slavish deference to agency decisions, because that'snot a true adversarial process,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;The alternative to open competition is the buddy system -- if we want thefederal procurement system to look like the Washington, D.C., system underMayor Barry,&quot; said GSBCA Judge Stephen Daniels.andP;  &quot;When agencies are spendinga good slug of the taxpayers' money it's good to hold them up to toughscrutiny.&quot;andM;Robert J. Woods, deputy assistant secretary for IRM at the Veterans AffairsDepartment, said the likelihood of protests increases dramatically whenagencies bundle requirements into massive buys.andP;  The more expensive andcomplex an acquisition, the less likely it is that losing bidders will acceptdefeat, Woods said.andM;&quot;It's like if I lose $20 playing poker, I tell my wife I had bad luck,&quot; Woodssaid.andP;  &quot;If I go to Las Vegas and lose the house, I come home and tell her howthey cheated me.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
