Gen. Prosper Avril went onnational television early today to announce that forces loyal tohis government thwarted a coup attempt by power-hungry soldiers.   There were indications the attempt to overthrow Avril may havebeen related to his vow to crack down on officers involved in drugsmuggling.   The international airport remained closed early today andsoldiers patrolled Port-au-Prince streets, now quiet, that hadechoed with gunfire 24 hours earlier.   Avril, who assumed power in a coup six months ago, wasreportedly seized at his suburban home early Sunday and rescued byloyal soldiers as he was being driven to the airport to be deported.   ``Some members of the armed forces, blinded by their exorbitantambitions, attempted to overthrow the government,'' Avril said in a10-minute speech on state-run television.   ``I appeal to the nation to cooperate with us in peace and unityfor the realization of our democratic objectives,'' he added.   Avril gave no details of the attempted coup, but said, ``I havefaith in the army.'' There were no reports of casualties.   He was flanked by a dozen soldiers, including Sgt. Major JosephHeubreux, who led the September revolt by non-commissioned officersthat put Avril in power after ousting a regime blamed forwidespread human rights abuses.   ``Today's events have shown that the establishment of democracyin Haiti under the present circumstances is a long and arduoustask,'' said Avril, who has promised presidential elections thisyear and other reforms.   Loyalists in tanks thwarted Sunday's coup attempt by rescuing ahandcuffed Avril as he was being driven by rebel officers to theairport to be flown out of Haiti, according to presidentialguardsmen and a U.S. Embassy official.   A government communique said that in the early hours of the coupattempt ``certain officers besieged'' the presidential palace ``andattempted to overthrow the government.''   Last week, Avril fired four senior army officers for allegeddrug trafficking and promised the crackdown would bring more purgesin the military.   Richard Melton, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state forCaribbean affairs, had told Avril that resumption of $70 million inU.S. aid depended partly on efforts to curb the drug trade.   An army officer, Col. Jean-Claude Paul, was indicted by a Miamigrand jury on drug smuggling charges last year but died in Octoberafter eating soup that officials said was poisoned.   U.S. officials began to talk of restoring the funds after the50-year-old Avril came to power Sept. 17, 1988 in the coup thatousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. Namphy had ruled the country for mostof the 2{ years after Jean-Claude Duvalier was deposed in a 1986popular uprising that ended three decades of Duvalier family rule.   Details on Sunday's events were sketchy and sometimes conflicted.   Presidential guardsmen said Avril was taken captive early Sundayat his mansion in Canape Verte, a wealthy neighborhood in the hillsoverlooking Port-au-Prince after he returned home from a party.   They said Avril's wife, Marie-Ange, and her mother were takencaptive with Avril but released a few hours later.   Loyal soldiers said one of Avril's sons, two of his brothers,and Interior Minister Col. Acedius St. Louis and his son were alsoseized by the rebels. They were reportedly freed Sunday night afterloyalists in two tanks rolled into the Leopards commandobattalion's encampment outside the capital.   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said reports indicated thecoup attempt began at about 4:30 a.m. Sunday and that Avril wasdetained for a time. Unconfirmed reports said four army officersplanned the coup, including Gen. Guy Francois, commander of thepowerful Dessalines barracks. The unit's fortress next to theNational Palace houses the most feared fighters in Haiti's7,000-man army.   The reports said the four officers were detained.   Military sources confirmed that one officer identified as aleader, Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, was under military guard at theNational Palace. Rebu commanded the Leopards battalion.   The sources said coup leaders asked army commander Maj. Gen.Herard Abraham to assume the presidency and the plot collapsed whenhe refused.   Although Avril has promised elections this year and restoredsome suspended constitutional rights two weeks ago, critics say heis moving too slowly toward democratic reforms.   ``The only way for Haiti to stop having coups is for it to havea legitimate, constitutionally elected civilian government,'' saidLouis Dejoie Jr., a moderate politician with presidentialaspirations.</TEXT></DOC>
