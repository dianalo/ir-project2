The method consists of: providing the prismwith the reflection face angularly disposed with respect to the inputface; depositing a layer of light-sensitive material on the input faceof the prism; providing an auxiliary prism and a substance having a refractiveindex close to that of the light-sensitive material and placing the substancebetween the light-sensitive material and the auxiliary prism; recordingan interference pattern to obtain a three dimensional hologram in thelight-sensitive layer removing the auxiliary prism and the substance;and developing the light-sensitive layer; wherein the angular relationshipbetween the reflection face, the input face and the angle are chosento preclude the diffraction of a beam which has been reflected from thereflection face.</TEXT></DOC>
