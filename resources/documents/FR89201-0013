The elimination of MARAD'sforeign posts delays the collection of foreign wage cost data applicableto the annual subsidy rate calculations. To avoid potential delays in the finalization of wage subsidy rates whilecontinuing to maintain a fair and reasonable determination of the U.S./foreignwage cost differential, MARAD is amending andSection; 282.21(f) to providefor the comparison of U.S. and foreign wage costs as of January 1 of thefiscal year preceding the subsidized fiscal year. The percentage relationshipof foreign to U.S. wage costs resulting from the comparison would be appliedto the full U.S. wage costs determined as of January 1 of the subsidizedfiscal year to derive the corresponding foreign wage amount used in thesubsidy rate calculation. The foreign flags for which the wage cost determinationare made would continue to be those flags identified on the basis of datafrom the penultimate calendar year preceding January 1 of the subsidizedyear. MARAD is also amending andSection; 282.21(f) to provide that the exchangerates used to convert the foreign wage cost estimates into U.S. dollarsare the average end-month exchange rates for the period July through Junethat includes the January 1 for which the foreign costs are determined.The regulation presently provides a seven-month period for exchange ratesto permit timely ODS rate calculations. However, the regression of theU.S./foreign wage cost comparison by one year would permit the use of exchangerates for a twelve-month period without delaying final rate calculations.MARAD considers the use of twelve months of exchange rates perferable tothe shorter seven-month period. The NPRM provided a period for public comment that expired on June 27,1988. Written comments were received from one party, Matson NavigationCompany, Inc. (Matson), on June 27, 1988. Matson is an unsubsidized carrierthat operates exclusively in the domestic trades including a service fromHawaii to the U.S. West Coast. American President Lines, Ltd. (APL), asubsidized operator, has applied for service to and from Hawaii as partof the company's service from the U.S. West Coast to the Far East. A hearinghas commenced under section 805(a), Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended(46 App. U.S.C. 1223), in which Matson has intervened. Matson focused its attention on the receipt of subsidy by ODS contractorsoperating subsidized vessels in ``mixed voyages'' in which cargo is carriedin both domestic and foreign commerce. Matson's basic contention is thatprocedures currently followed in the administration of the ODS programallow payment of wage subsidy in excess of the amount required to placeODS operators on a cost parity with their principal foreign competitorsand, therefore, create an unfair competitive advantage against the unsubsidized,exclusively domestic operators. Matson maintains that under certain conditions(a continually declining U.S. dollar <T3>vis-a-vis </T3>other foreign currencies) a nonsubsidized operator isfurther disadvantaged by a rate methodology which does not include currentfull-year exchange rates applied to current foreign wage cost data. Matsonurges the return to a system that requires the use of current full-yearexchange rates applied to current foreign wage cost data.Matson's basic contention that procedures currently used for the calculationof ODS allow payment of wage subsidy in excess of parity refers to argumentsthat the operator put forth in Docket S-801, the section 805(a) hearingin which Matson intervened. Matson contends that the indexing system adoptedin the 1970 amendments to the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, along with the1986 regulations adopted by MARAD (46 CFR 282) which base ODS paymentson estimates with periodic, prospective adjustments, creates a system inwhich operators may be paid ODS in excess of parity. This argument is usedas a prelude to the specific complaints that Matson has with the proposedamendments. As Matson does not seek to argue the merits of the 1970 amendmentsor the 1986 regulations in this rulemaking proceeding, and inasmuch asthese arguments are beyond the scope of this final rule, MARAD will notaddress those contentions. However, Matson's specific objections to this final rule are directed atthe very basis of the changes incorporated in this rule, and merit review.Matson's complaints are twofold: (1) That a twelve month cycle should beemployed in the determination of a final exchange rate, as opposed to theseven month cycle that is now being used; and (2) that the full year employedto determine the final exchange rate should correspond to the current twelvemonth subsidy rate period, July to July, and that the exchange rates shouldbe applied to foreign wage costs determined for that period. MARAD's principal goal in adopting and implementing 46 CFR 282 in 1986was to provide a means for determining and paying subsidy in a more timelyand more predictable manner. This enables operators receiving ODS to budgetand to plan more accurately. To accomplish a more timely determinationof ODS, the current procedures in 46 CFR 282 reduced the period for analysisof end-month exchange rates from twelve months (July to July) to sevenmonths (July to January). Exchange rates from the seven months are appliedto the current foreign wage data to determine foreign wage costs. The regressionof the U.S./foreign wage cost comparison by one year as proposed in theNPRM permits the use of exchange rates for a twelve-month period withoutdelaying final rate determinations. Matson agrees that MARAD should return to a twelve-month exchange ratecycle. However, Matson further urges a return to the procedure that MARADformerly used, that is, the foreign wage costs used in the ODS rate calculationshould be determined by applying the current year exchange rates to thecurrent year foreign wage cost data. Matson argues that by regressing data a full year, unsubsidized operatorswill be disadvantaged <T3>vis-a-vis </T3>ODS operators on ``mixed voyages,'' in periods whenthe U.S. dollar is in a continual decline in comparison with foreign currencies.Under this scenario, the difference between U.S. and foreign wages continuesto shrink. Therefore, the difference between the currencies and exchangerates is greater at the close of the regressed year than in the currentyear. The subsidy rate will also be greater at the close of the regressedyear than during the rate year. This argument is correct, as far as itgoes. However, Matson views the situation from only a single approach.While a declining U.S. dollar is the current economic scenario, historicallythe U.S. dollar has both increased and decreased <T3>vis-a-vis </T3>foreign currencies. In other words, the recent declineof the U.S. dollar should not be viewed as a permanent situation. In thosesituations where the U.S. dollar is strengthening, Matson's contentionwith respect to the ODS operator having an advantage would be reversed.Furthermore, it is difficult to imagine that a nonsubsidized operator couldbe seriously disadvantaged under any scenario. Section 605(a) of the MerchantMarine Act provides that for subsidized voyages having a domestic cargoleg, ODS for the entire voyage is reduced by the same ratio that the domesticcargo revenue bears to the gross revenue derived from the entire voyage.The Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, provides that ODS is based ona fair and reasonable estimate of foreign costs. The current proceduresin 46 CFR Part 282 and the proposed procedures with respect to wage costregression conform to that requirement. MARAD also does not believe thatMatson's objections to the proposed rulemaking are sufficiently compellingto prevent MARAD from adopting the proposed procedures as a Final Rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Regulatory Impacts</ITAG>This amendment has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it hasbeen determined that this is not a major rule. It will not result in anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be noincrease in production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governments, agencies, or geographic regions. Furthermore,it will not adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This amendment is not significant within the definition in DOT's RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures, 49 FR 11034 (1979), in part because it does notinvolve any change in important Departmental policies. Because the economicimpact should be minimal, further regulatory evaluation is not necessary.Moreover, the Maritime Administrator certifies that this amendment willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.This amendment does not significantly affect the environment. An environmentalimpact statement is not required under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969. It has also been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient implicationsfor federalism to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.Finally, the amendment is exempt from the Paperwork Reduction Act becauseit does not include new information requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 282</ITAG>Liner cargo vessels, ODS program, Water transportation.Accordingly, 46 CFR Part 282 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 282_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
