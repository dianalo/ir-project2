Although Pennzoil said it had acquired about 12 million shares ofBurlington as an investment, or about an 8 percent interest, thecompany did not rule out future transactions.   ``We may dispose of all our part (of the stock) or we may buyadditional shares,'' Pennzoil spokesman Bob Harper said.   Harper said Houston-based Pennzoil is not looking to force a``merger, reorganization, liquidation, sale or transfer of amaterial amount of assets, or any change of management'' inBurlington, a large Seattle-based diversified resource and energyholding company.   On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, Burlington's stock soared$9.87{ a share to $49.12{ compared with Friday's close. Pennzoilclosed up $1.50 at $83.25 a share.   Pennzoil filed documents with the Securities and ExchangeCommission on Friday because it had exceeded 5 percent ownership ofBurlington stock, Harper said. Under SEC rules, any investment in apublicly held company that passes the 5 percent threshhold must bereported to the federal agency.   Pennzoil disclosed it had bought nearly 8.6 million shares ofBurlington Resources stock for about $300 million and got 3.4million more shares as a result of a distribution by BurlingtonNorthern Inc. In addition, Pennzoil purchased another 355,000 sharesearlier this month, the company said.   Burlington Resources was spun off last year from BurlingtonNorthern.   The stock acquisition was an investment, but Pennzoil said in itsSEC filing it will take ``actions deemed appropriate'' pending itscontinued review of Burlington's business affairs.   A spokesman for Burlington Resources did not return telephonecalls Monday.   Industry observers have been waiting to see how Pennzoil wouldspend the $3 billion settlement it received last April from Texacoto end the companies' four-year legal battle over Texaco'sacquisition of Getty Oil Co.   Prior to the Burlington stock purchase, Pennzoil's only majorinvestment since the Texaco settlement had been the $250 millionpurchase of Facet Enterprise Inc. of Oklahoma City. Facetmanufactures automotive parts and oil-field equipment.   One analyst said Monday that Pennzoil's stock acquisition doesn'tmean Burlington is an actual takeover target.   ``Their move is perplexing,'' said Paul Kuklinski of Cowen andamp; Co.in Boston. ``It is not clear to me if this is anything more than aninvestment. Typically, when a company acquires this size of stock,the intention is fairly evident, but not this time.''   Kuklinski said that in the past, Pennzoil has acquired fairlygood amounts of stock for investment purposes and not followedthrough with takeover attempts.   In addition, Burlington has some attractive assets it would beexpensive to buy, he said.   But other analysts said they believe Pennzoil is positioningitself for a takeover _ whether by accumulating more stock on theopen market or by making an offer _ before Burlington has theopportunity to put up more barriers.   Burlington has shown little interest in being acquired,installing a ``poison pill'' and other takeover defenses inDecember. The pill, designed to make an unwelcome takeoverprohibitively expensive, would be triggered when a hostile bidderacquired 20 percent or more of the voting power of BurlingtonResources.   ``The cat is in the bag. I'm sure they won't sit on their handson this one. I think they will actively pursue something one way oranother,'' said Ron Londe, an analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.   Londe said Pennzoil likely won't take the whole company, but``gas reserves are first on the menu.''   Burlington is believed to hold the largest natural gas reservesin the United States outside of the major oil companies, with anearly 18-year supply, compared with an industry average of 10 years.   A merger of Pennzoil and Burlington would propel the company intoa position just under the majors in natural gas reserves, Londe said.   ``They would have 5.8 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves _ thatmeans a lot,'' he said.   Burlington Resources' largest units include El Paso Natural GasCo., which consists of a 22,000-mile interstate gas transmissionsystem extending from West Texas to California and Meridian Oil Co.,one of the nation's largest independent oil and gas companies.   Burlington also has extensive mining operations, including gold,and more than a million acres of timberland.   Analysts valued Burlington Resources stock at between $49 and $51a share.</TEXT></DOC>
