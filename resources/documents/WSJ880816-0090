The theory is that the many thousands of shareholders will have a broader range of investment vision and more powerful profit incentives than the corporation's managers. As a group, they will thus find the most productive uses of the capital.    While that is sound theory, in the real world the theory has to be modified. Dividends are taxed as ordinary income, so tax-paying shareholders are handicapped by the tax collector as they set about to out-perform management. To be sure, today's flatter tax rates have reduced the handicap from the days when the top rates were 50% or more. But even 28% is a hurdle. That is why for many years investors by and large have been content to let managements reinvest earnings to try to generate higher stock prices and capital gains. It also is why free-market economists have urged -- albeit unsuccessfully -- an end to the double taxation of dividends.    It was partly for reasons akin to these that the Chicago-based FMC Corp. decided in the spring of 1986 to distribute a major chunk of its capital to shareholders. Another reason was that the company saw recapitalization as a way of protecting itself against hostile takeovers. With its good position in its markets and strong cash flow, it was a prime target. Robert Malott, chairman and chief executive, says this consideration was &quot;peripheral&quot; but all the signs would suggest that the periphery was pretty close to the center.    &quot;Although it was not high on our list of reasons, I'm delighted that we did it in relationship to what I've seen happening to other companies since,&quot; he says. &quot;One way or another we would have been a candidate. Right now there is a lot of money available to invest in hostile takeovers, the price of which in most cases can only be justified by breaking the companies up. I just don't think that's very healthy.&quot;    The 1986 &quot;recap&quot; suffered some hitches because of an alleged premature leak to Ivan Boesky, whom FMC is suing for trading up FMC stock and thereby forcing the company to revise its plan. But on the whole, the FMC recap seems to be working out OK for the parties most concerned, employees and shareholders. Circumstances have changed since 1986, giving FMC more interesting opportunities for direct investment, but Mr. Malott suggests he would not be averse to doing another recap some day if circumstances again warranted it.    Mr. Malott called his recapitalization a &quot;public leveraged buy-out,&quot; or public LBO. Public shareholders received $80 and a new share of stock valued at $17.14 for each old share. The cash could be treated as a capital gain for tax purposes. Old shares had soared in price to $97 from $71.75 over the preceding three months, thanks in part to the inside trading of Mr. Boesky, or so FMC charges in its lawsuit. As a result, FMC had to raise its cash offer from an initial $70.    Management and FMC's employee thrift program, however, received in lieu of cash an equivalent amount of new stock. The upshot was a sharp rise in management and employee ownership, which now stands at 40% compared with 18% before the LBO. The company is heavily leveraged (indebted) and, most likely, totally immune to hostile takeovers. But analysts seem to like FMC's prospects. Its new shares are now trading at around $35.    In his offices high in one of those towers that dot the Chicago lakefront, Mr. Malott admits to some trepidation when he undertook the recap. &quot;We leveraged from $300 million to $2.3 billion and took net worth down from $1 billion to a negative 500 or 600 million dollars. Anyone who says he would not be concerned about that has got to be crazy. That kind of change of capital structure gets your attention. It not only has but it will continue to do so. We are a higher risk company than we were before.&quot;    But aside from capital structure, FMC is pretty much the same company. It evolved out of the old Food Machinery andamp; Chemical Corp. and still makes food-processing equipment, but that is now a relatively small part of its $3 billion-plus in annual sales. Industrial and agricultural chemicals are a major source of revenues and profits. It also is a big defense contractor, with contracts to produce armored troop carriers, rocket launchers and other military equipment.    Mr. Malott says the FMC board decided to do the recapitalization because the company was in mature industries but generating a lot of cash. &quot;Basically we had fairly good market positions in most of the markets we are in. Most of them were not growing very rapidly. All of them with a few exceptions were generating more cash than we could internally use.    &quot;We made a very aggressive effort to look for acquisitions as a way of intelligently using shareholder money and weren't very successful. We looked at a lot of them and the market was such that the greater fools would outbid us. We could have used our money that way. We could have closed some of those deals but I -- and I think my associates -- felt it was not in the shareholders' best interests to overpay. So therefore we bought very few.    &quot;We had a few small acquisitions that have done very well, but we couldn't use the bulk of the cash we were generating. So I was casting around for some way of using this money effectively. The first thing we did was a Dutch auction. We used some $450 million to buy 25% of our shares at a little over $50. In spite of that we continued to generate excess cash so I started looking at alternative ways of recapitalizing the company and we went through a whole range of alternatives.    &quot;This idea of a public LBO, where we leave the shareholders in but leverage the company and pay the public shareholders a substantial amount of cash, had been done once before as far as I recall, by a company not on the New York Stock Exchange. We discarded the other alternatives in favor of this one.&quot;    Management now owns about 8.5% of FMC's stock, with an additional 31% or so owned by the 14,000 employees who are members of the company's thrift plans, mainly a 401k stock-purchase program with matching contributions from the company. Mr. Malott thinks the rise in employee ownership has been positive.    &quot;I think ideally every company should be run as if those who run it own it,&quot; Mr. Malott says. &quot;I think you tend to get better management and a better company. We can see some of that. I think it is a bit too early to tell how much that's going to happen. But our employees are obviously a lot more interested in the price of the stock. We post the stock every day on most of the bulletin boards throughout our plants and offices. So they take more interest in their jobs and the contributions they make.&quot;    Mr. Malott says that with the improved economic outlook there are better opportunities for internal investment this year, with the result that the company's direct investment will rise. It also is interested once again in acquisitions, although prices of potential acquisitions are again being bid up, in part by foreign investors.    One thing he is not interested in is diversification for the sake of diversification. &quot;That is a job for our shareholders.&quot; On that, a lot of free-market economists would agree. </TEXT></DOC>
