Late Sunday, about 50 students marched around the universitycampus chanting, ``Continue the strike! Continue the strike!'' Thecry soon was picked up by classmates shouting from dormitorywindows.   Students at other universities in Beijing that participated inthe class boycott have decided to return to class after stagingseveral mass demonstrations that brought tens of thousands ofpeople onto the streets.   But the independent student union at Beijing University, thenation's most prestigious school, decided at a meeting Sunday nightto continue the boycott through Friday. ``We are the only oneskeeping the flame,'' said one student leader. The boycott beganApril 24.   The group listed as conditions for returning to class governmentrecognition of new student unions that have organized the fledglingpro-democracy movement; reinstatement of a recently fired liberalShanghai newspaper editor; changing city laws that restrictdemonstrations; and an apology from the official People's Dailynewspaper for ``distorted reporting'' of the student movement.   If the government fails to meet the conditions or refuses tohold a dialogue with pro-democracy students, further protestmarches may be called, Beijing University student activists said.   One new poster at the university suggested daily sit-ins atTiananmen Square, the symbolic center of China.   ``All of China watches Beijing. All of Beijing watches BeijingUniversity,'' another poster said.   The largest protests in Communist China's 40-year history, inwhich tens of thousands of students and workers marched throughBeijing and occupied Tiananmen Square, have resulted inconciliatory statements from the nation's leaders and politicaldebate that would have been unimaginable just one month earlier.   But leading student activists seem unsure of what to do next tokeep up the movement's momentum.   Although Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang on Thursday calledfor talks with students, China's leadership has refused to talkwith the independent student unions.   A new group of pro-democracy students was set up last week toinitiate talks with the government. It sent a written appeal toparty and government leaders, who promised to reply Monday.   Xiang Xiaoji, a leader of the Student Dialogue RepresentativeGroup, said Sunday the group wanted to ``raise some constructiveproposals for the future building of democracy and the legalsystem.''   Issues he named for discussion included education, familyplanning and price reform, but he did not mention establishing afree press and fighting corruption _ major demands of the democracymovement.   ``We don't set ourselves up as the government's opponent,''Xiang said. ``Our government is the people's government, and we arecitizens.''</TEXT></DOC>
