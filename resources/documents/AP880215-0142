(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most of the presidential candidates inTuesday's New Hampshire primary were struggling not just to win,but to avoid losing so badly that it could virtually eliminate themfrom the race.   Democrat Bruce Babbitt, who finished a dismal fifth in the Iowacaucuses, managed a joke about the precarious existence of hiscampaign.   ``Bruce Babbitt frankly did not start out as a household name,and some would say he'll end this race as not a household name,''the former Arizona governor said at one stop Sunday night.   But for most of his rivals and for those at the back of the GOPpack, the prospect that the nation's first primary could also betheir last was no joking matter.   Nearly to a man they were vowing to press on no matter what, butfacing the prospect that a resounding defeat in New Hampshire mightforce them to abandon their White House ambitions in the snow, justas Alexander Haig did on Friday.   George Bush, the acknowledged front-runner here until athird-place Iowa finish threw a wrench into the gears of hiscampaign machinery, has the money and resolve to continue evenshould he sustain a second loss to Bob Dole.   But a primary defeat here would evoke the memory of WalterMondale's loss in the Democratic primary four years ago _ anoutcome that ensured a long, brutal struggle to the convention anda nomination that proved worthless.   Democrats Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. campaigned knowingthey had a ticket to Super Tuesday, the next major campaign threeweeks hence across the South. Republican Pat Robertson is sure togo on, too.   But there's no such assurance for Democrats Gary Hart, PaulSimon, Richard Gephardt and Babbitt, who need badly to beatsomebody. Gephardt, a winner in Iowa, seemed to need a second placefinish here to sustain a candidacy badly in debt _ and Simon neededthe same. Michael Dukakis, governor of neighboring Massachusetts,needed not only to win, but by a respectable margin.   Republicans Jack Kemp and Pete du Pont needed to beat each other.   Babbitt told a crowd at a Jewish temple in Manchester Sundaynight, ``New Hampshire this Tuesday has within its grasp the powerof life and death over my candidacy.   ``There are people who tell you my candidacy is over. They'rethe same people who tell you your vote doesn't matter,'' saidBabbitt, who fielded questions for more than an hour and even thenseemed reluctant to go.   ``I'm willing to stay here till the sunrise, whether it comes atthe usual time or Pat Robertson makes it a little earlier,'' hejoked.   What kind of finish would it take to allow Babbitt to stay inthe race? ``We're looking for a reason to hang on,'' Babbittspokesman Mike McCurry said over the weekend.   Babbitt's campaign has put up some of its computers for saleback home in Phoenix. Campaign spokesman Scott Phelps said theywere surplus now that the Iowa caucuses are finished, and did notsignify an impending campaign shutdown.   Du Pont went into Iowa's caucuses saying all he needed to do wasto beat Kemp to establish himself as the conservatives'alternative. He failed to do that, so how could he withstandfailing to beat Kemp here too?   ``I'm going South in any case,'' du Pont insisted.   In Concord on Monday, du Pont dismissed the pundits'prognostications. ``Oh, you remember pundits. They're the ones whotold us President Dewey would soon be taking the oath of office,that President Muskie had this nomination under control, thatWalter Mondale was facing the biggest election victory'' here fouryears ago, he said.   ``I dont know where all those poitical pundits are today butthey ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run forcover tomorrow,'' said du Pont.</TEXT></DOC>
