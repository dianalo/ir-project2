(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who repeatedly stole eggs fromthe nests of endangered sea turtles was sentenced Tuesday to twoyears in prison.   It is believed to be the longest prison sentence imposed underthe Endangered Species Act, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said in astatement.   James Bivins, 37, of West Palm Beach, pleaded guilty in June totaking 818 green and loggerhead sea turtle eggs from 17 nests onJupiter Island Beach in August 1988.   Six weeks earlier, wildlife officers had caught him poaching1,088 eggs from a state park in Riviera Beach, the U.S. attorney'soffice said. He also had a 1973 turtle egg theft case in whichadjudication was withheld.   ``By destroying these nests, James Bivins has pushed theendangered green sea turtles one step closer to extinction,''Lehtinen said in his sentencing recommendation.   After Bivins' second arrest, he had agreed to cooperate withFlorida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission officers as aninformant, and cease his nest raids.   At that time he told them customers paid him up to $15 for adozen sea turtle eggs. Some people believe the eggs are anaphrodisiac, while others buy them for the taste.   State game officers abandoned Bivins as an informant after histhird arrest.   U.S. District Judge James C. Paine ordered that Bivins serve twoyears in prison, followed by a year's supervised release and threeyears of probation.</TEXT></DOC>
