Specifically, the proposed revision:(1) Reflects changes in the Agency's FOIA procedures necessitated by internalreorganizations and by the 1982 separation of Peace Corps from ACTION;(2) codifies the centralized coordination of responses to FOIA requestswhich has for some time been the <T3>de facto</T3> practice of the Agency; and (3) implements certain provisionsof the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L 99-570, in accordancewith the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Uniform Freedom of InformationAct Fee Schedule and Guidelines, 52 FR 10012 (March 27, 1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on the proposed rule must be received on or beforeFebruary 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be sent to: Assistant Director, Officeof Administration, ACTION, Room M-306, 806 Connecticut Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20525.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Gregory C. La Rosa, AssistantGeneral Counsel, (202) 634-9333.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.552, as amended, requires each agency of the Federal Government to promulgateregulations informing the public of procedures for requesting informationunder the Act, specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the processingof such requests, and establishing procedures and guidelines for determiningwhen such fees should be waived or reduced. ACTION's current FOIA regulationwas promulgated in 1975 (40 FR 18558, Apr. 29, 1975).Further, under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Reform Actof 1986, Pub. L. 99-570, andSection;andSection; 1801-1804, 100 Stat. 3207,3207-48 (1986), all Federal agencies subject to the FOIA are required topromulgate new fee and fee waiver regulations. Such regulations must informthe public of criteria (based on the identity of the requester) for assessingFOIA request processing fees; and of the factors to be considered in determiningwhether requests for fee waivers or reductions will be granted by the agency.Under the new legislation, such fee waivers or reductions may be grantedonly where disclosure of the requested information is in the public interestbecause it is likely to contribute significantly to public understandingof the operations or activities of the Government, <T3>and </T3> it is established that disclosure of the information is notprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester. OMB published guidancefor all Federal agencies in drafting such fee regulations in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 27, 1987; additional guidance was providedto the agencies by the Department of Justice in a Memorandum dated April2, 1987. Section 1215.7 of this proposed regulation, ACTION's scheduleof fees, is consistent with the guidance of OMB and the Department of Justice.The proposed revision is intended both (1) to provide to the public detailedinformation regarding ACTION's adminstrative procedures for FOLA requests,responses, appeals, and fee assessments, and (2) to set forth for FOIArequesters the criteria the Agency will apply in accepting FOIA requests,in responding to FOIA requests for business information, and in rulingon requests for fee waivers or reductions. The factors to be consideredby the Agency in making determinations regarding fee waivers and reductionsconform to criteria established in guidence provided to Executive agenciesby OMB and the Department of Justice.Additionally, the proposed regulation no longer gives examples of the typesof records which may be withheld from disclosure under the FOIA exemptions(set forth at andSection;1215.5 of the current regulation), because it isfelt that such examples are gratuitous to the extent they simply repeatthe language of the Act, and may be misleading and/or become easily outdatedto the extent they suggest that denial of access may be based on generalizationsrather than on case-by-case review.ACTION has determined that this proposed regulation is not a major ruleas defined by Executive Order 12291. The regulation will not result in:1. A major effect on the economy;2. A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regional; or3. Any adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productively,innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This proposed regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as defined by section 605(b) of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq</T3>.), as the rule codifies changes in the Agency's internalpractice and procedure only.The proposed regulation does not constitute a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment, as defined by the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (Pub. L. 91-190, 42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq</T3>.).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1215</ITAG>Freedom of Information Act, Administrative practice and procedure.For the reasons set out in the Preamble, the Director of ACTION proposesto revise 45 CFR Part 1215 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1215_PROCEDURES FOR DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS UNDER THE FREEDOM OFINFORMATION ACT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.1 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.3 Availability of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.4 Location of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.5 Record request and response procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.6 Time limits and extensions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.7 Schedule of fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.8 Business information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1215.9 Appeal procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Pub.

Informationcustomarily furnished to the public in the regular course of ACTION's officialbusiness may continue to be furnished to the public without complying withthis part, provided that the furnishing of such information would not violatethe Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). Rules for the disclosure by ACTIONof records protected by the Privacy Act are set forth at 45 CFR Part 1224.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1215.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>As used in this part, the following definitions shall apply:(a) ``The Act'' means the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).  (b) ``The Agency'' means ACTION.   (c) ``Records'' include all books, papers, maps, photographs or other documentarymaterial, or copies thereof, regardless of physical form or characteristics,made or received by ACTION and preserved as evidence of its organization,functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or other activities;but do not include books, magazines, or other materials not produced byACTION and acquired solely for reference purposes.(d) ``Search'' means time spent locating records responsive to a request,including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of responsive materialwithin a record.   (e) ``Review'' means the process of examining records located in responseto a request to determine whether any record or portion of a record ispermitted to be withheld. It also includes processing records for disclosure(<T3>i.e., </T3>excising portions not subject to disclosure under the Actand otherwise preparing them for release). Review does not include timespent resolving legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptionsunder the Act.   (f) ``Commercial use request'' means a request from, or on behalf of, aperson who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial,trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalfthe request is made. The use to which a requester will put the recordssought will be considered in determining whether the request is a commercialuse request.(g) ``Educational institution'' means a preschool, a public or privateelementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or graduatehigher education, an institution of professional education, or an institutionof vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarlyresearch.(h) ``Non-commercial scientific institution'' means an institution thatis not operated on a for-profit basis and which is operated solely forthe purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which arenot intended to promote any particular product or industry.(i) ``Representative of the news media'' means any person actively gatheringnews for an entity that is organized and operated to disseminate news tothe public. The term ``news'' means information that is about current eventsor that would otherwise be of current interest to the public. Examplesof news media entities include, but are not limited to, television andradio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals(but only those publishers who qualify as disseminators of `'news'') whomake their products available for purchase or subscription by the generalpublic. Moreover, as new methods of news disseminatioin evolve (<T3>e.g.</T3>, electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunicationsservices), such alternative media would be included in this category. ``Freelance''journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if theycan demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization,even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would bethe clearest proof, but the Agency may also look to the past publicationrecord of a requester in making this determination.(j) ``Business information'' means trade secrets or other commercial orfinancial information.(k) ``Business submitter'' means any commercial entity which provides businessinformation to ACTION and which has a proprietary interest in such information.(l) ``Appeal'' means the appeal by a requester of an adverse Agency determinationon his request, or on his application for a waiver of fees, as describedin 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1215.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Availability of records.</ITAG>(a) All publications and other documents heretofore provided by ACTIONto the public in the normal course of Agency business will continue tobe made available upon request to the Agency.(b) The Agency will promptly make available to any member of the publicwho requests them, the following Agency records:(1) Final opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases;(2) Statements of policy and interpretation adopted by an office whichhave not been published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>; and(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to the staff which affectthe public.(c) A current index, which shall be updated at least quarterly, of theforegoing materials, is maintained by the Agency, and copies of some orany portion thereof will be furnished upon request. The Agency deems furtherpublication of such index in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> unnecessary and impractical.(d) To the extent necessary to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion ofpersonal privacy, the Agency may delete identifying details from materialsfurnished under this section.(e) Brochures, leaflets, and other similar published materials shall befurnished to the public on request to the extent they are available. Copiesof any such materials which are out of print shall be furnished at thecost of duplication, provided, however, that, in the event no copy exists,the Agency shall not be responsible for reprinting the document.(f) All records of ACTION which are requested by a member of the publicin accordance with the procedures established in this part shall be timelymade available for inspection or copying, at the Agency's option, exceptto the extent that the Agency determines such records are exempt from disclosureunder the Act.(g) The Agency will not be required to create new records, compile listsof selected items from its files, or provide a requester with statisticalor other data (unless such data have been compiled previously and are availablein the form of a record, in which event such data shall be made availableas provided in this part).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1215.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Location of records.</ITAG>(a) The Agency maintains a central records room at its headquarters, locatedat 806 Connecticut Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20525.

All such requests, and the evelopes in which theyare sent, must be plainly marked ``FOIA Request''. Hand-delivered requestswill be received between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excepton official holidays.(b) <T3>Agreement to pay fees.</T3> The filing of a request under this subpartshall be deemed to constitute an agreement by the requester to pay allapplicable fees under andSection; 1215.7 of this part, up to $25, unlessa waiver of fees is sought in the request letter. When filing a request,a requester may agree to pay a greater amount, if costs are expected toexceed $25.00.(c) <T3>Request must adequately describe the record sought.</T3> A requestmust describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Agencypersonnel to locate the records with reasonable effort. A request shallbe regarded as fulfilling this requirement if it enables the Agency toidentify responsive documents without unreasonable burden to or disruptionof Agency operations. Persons wishing to inspect or secure copies of recordsshould describe and identify such records as fully and as accurately aspossible. Among the kinds of identifying information which a requestermay provide are the following:(1) The unit or program of the Agency which may have produced or may otherwisehave custody of the record (<T3>e.g.,</T3> VISTA, RSVP, FGP);(2) The specific event or action, if any, to which the record pertains;(3) The date of the record, or the time period to which it refers or relates;(4) The type of record (<T3>e.g.,</T3> application, contract, grant or report); (5) The name(s) of Agency personnel who may have prepared or been referencedin the record; and (6) Citation to newspapers or other publications which refer to the record.(7) The distribution made of the record.(d) <T3>Initial processing.</T3> Upon receipt of a request for Agency records,the Director, Administrative Services Division, will make an initial determinationas to whether the request describes requested records with sufficient specificityto determine the office of the Agency having custody of any responsiverecords. If so, upon making such initial determination, he shall refersuch request to the head of the custodial office. The office head shallpromptly ascertain whether the description of records(s) requested is sufficientto permit a determination as to existence, identification, and location.(e) <T3>Insufficiently identified records.</T3> On making a determination thatthe description contained in the request does not sufficiently describea requested record, the Director, Administrative Services Division, shallpromptly so advise the requester in writing; the requester may submit anamended request providing necessary additional identifying information.Such a request shall be deemed to have been received by the Agency on thedate it receives the amended request. (f) <T3>Release of records; denial and right to appeal.</T3> Upon receipt ofa request specifically identifying existing Agency records, the Agencyshall, within ten working days, either grant or deny the request in wholeor in part, as provided in this subpart. Any notice of denial in wholeor in part shall also inform the requester of this right to appeal thedenial, in accordance with the procedures set forth at andSection; 1215.9below. If the Assistant Director, Administrative Services Division, determinesthat a request describes a requested record sufficiently to permit itsidentification, he/she shall review the requested records with the custodialoffice and the General Counsel, and shall make it available as providedherein, unless he/she decides to withhold the records as exempt from mandatorydisclosure under the Act. (g) <T3>Form and content of notice granting a request.</T3> The Agency shallprovide written notice of a determination to grant a request. Such noticeshall describe the manner in which the record will be disclosed, whetherby providing a copy of the record to the requester or by making the recordavailable to the requester for inspection at a reasonable time and place.The procedure for inspection shall not unreasonably disrupt the operationsof the Agency. The Agency shall inform the requester in the notice of anyfees charged in accordance with the provisions of andSection; 1215.7 of thispart. (h)<T3> Form and content of notice denying a request.</T3> The Agency shallnotify a requester in writing of the denial of a request in whole or inpart. Such notice shall include: (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;(2) A brief statement of the reason or reasons for the denial, includingthe exemption or exemptions under the Act on which the Agency has reliedin denying the request, and a specific explanation of the manner in whichthe exemption or exemptions apply to each record withheld; and (3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under andSection; 1215.9of this part, and a copy of that section. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1215.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Time limits and extensions. </ITAG>(a) The time limits specified for the Agency's initial response in andSection;1215.5, and for its determination on an appeal in andSection; 1215.9, aremandatory, and a person requesting records shall be deemed to have exhaustedhis administrative remedies with respect to such request in the event theAgency fails to comply with the applicable time limits in accordance withthis section. (b) The time limits specified for the Agency's initial response in andSection;1215.5, and for its determination on an appeal in andSection; 1215.9, maybe extended by the Agency upon written notice to the requester which setsforth the reasons for such extension and the date upon which the Agencywill respond to the request. Such extension may be applied at either theinitial response stage or the appeal stage, or both, provided the aggregateof such extensions shall not exceed ten working days. Circumstances justifyingan extension under this subpart may include the following: (1) Time necessary to search for and collect requested records from fieldoffices of the Agency; (2) Time necessary to locate, collect and review voluminous records responsiveto a single request; or (3) Time necessary for consultation with another agency having an interestin the request; or among two or more offices of ACTION which have an interestin the request; or with a submitter of business information having an interestin the request. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1215.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Schedule of fees. </ITAG>(a) It is the policy of ACTION to encourage the widest possible disseminationof information concerning the programs under its jurisdiction. To the extentpracticable, this policy will be applied under this part so as to permitrequests for inspection of copies of records to be met without substantialcost to requesters. (b) Request processing charges will be determined by category of request,as follows: (1)<T3> Commercial use requests.</T3> When a request for records is made forcommercial use, charges will be assessed to cover the costs of searchingfor, reviewing for release, and reproducing the records sought. (2) <T3>Requests from educational and non-commercial scientific institutions.</T3>When a request for records is made by an educational or a non-commercialscientific institution in furtherance of scholarly or scientific research,respectively, charges will be assessed to cover the cost of reproductionalone, excluding charges for reproduction of the first 100 pages. (3)<T3> Requests from representatives of the news media.</T3> When a requestfor records is made by a representative of the news media for the purposeof news dissemination, charges will be assessed to cover the cost of reproductionalone, excluding charges for reproduction of the first 100 pages. (4)<T3> All other requests.</T3> When a request for records is made by a requesterwho does not fit into any of the preceding categories, charges will beassessed to cover the costs of searching for and reproducing the recordssought, excluding charges for the first two hours of search time and forreproduction of the first 100 pages. (However, requests from record subjectsfor records about themselves contained in the Agency's systems of recordswill be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 whichpermit the assessment of fees for reproduction costs only, regardless ofthe requester's characterization of the request).(c) Fees assessed shall provide only for recovery of the Agency's directcosts of search, review, and reproduction. Review costs shall include onlythe direct costs incurred during the initial examination of a record forthe purposes of determining whether a record must be disclosed under thispart and whether any portion of a record is exempt from disclosure underthis part. Review costs shall not include any costs incurred in resolvinglegal or policy issues raised in the course of processing a request oran appeal under this part. (d) When the Agency believes that a requester or group of requesters hasdivided one request into a series of requests for the purpose of evadingthe assessment of fees, the Agency may treat such requests as a singlerequest. (e) The following charges may be assessed for copies of records providedto a requester: (1) Copies made by photostat shall be charged at the rate of $0.10 perpage. (2) Searches for requested records performed by clerical/administrativepersonnel shall be charged at the rate of $3.00 per quarter hour. (3) Where a search for requested records cannot be performed by clerical/administrativepersonnel (for example, where the tasks of identifying and compiling recordsresponsive to a request must be performed by a skilled technician or professional),such search shall be charged at the rate of $5.50 per quarter hour. (4) Computer searches for requested records shall be charged at a ratecommensurate with the combined cost of computer operation and operator'ssalary attributable to the search. (f) In the event a request for records does not state that the requesterwill pay all reasonable costs, or costs up to a specified dollar amount,and the Director, Administrative Services Division, determines that theanticipated assessable costs for search, review and reproduction of requestedrecords will exceed $25.00, or will exceed the limit specified in the request,the requester shall be promptly notified in writing. Such notificationshall state the anticipated assessable costs of search, review and reproductionof records requested. The requester shall be afforded an opportunity toamend the request to narrow the scope of the request, or, alternatively,may agree to be responsible to pay the anticipated costs. Such a requestshall be deemed to have been received by the Agency upon the date of receiptof the amended request. (g) Advance payment of assessable fees may be required from a requesterwhen: (1) The Agency estimates or determines that assessable charges are likelyto exceed $250.00, and the requester has no history of payment of FOIAfees. (Where the requester has a history of prompt payment of fees, theAgency may require satisfactory assurance of full payment.) (2) A requester has previously failed to pay a FOIA fee charged in a timelyfashion (<T3>i.e.,</T3> within 30 days of the date of the billing). When the Agency acts under paragraph (g) (1) or (2) of this section, theadministrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the Act willbegin to run only after the Agency has received fee payments or assurances.(h) Interest charges on an unpaid bill may be assessed starting on the31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest willbe assessed at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title 31 U.S.C.,and will accrue from the date of billing. (i) Payment of fees shall be made to the Director, Administrative ServicesDivision, by check or money order payable to ``ACTION.'' A receipt forany fees paid will be provided upon written request. (j) Charges may be assessed for search and review time, even if the Agencyfails to locate records responsive to a request or if records located aredetermined to be exempt from disclosure. (k) No fee shall be charged if the costs of routine collection and processingof the fee will equal or exceed the amount of the fee.(l)(1) a requester may, in the original request, or subsequently, applyfor a waiver or reduction of document search, review and reproduction fees.Such application shall be in writing, and shall set forth in detail thereason(s) a fee waiver or reduction should be granted. The amount of anyreduction requested shall be specified in the request. Upon receipt ofsuch a request, the Director of Administrative Services shall refer therequest to the Deputy Director or to such official as the Deputy Directormay designate, who shall promptly determine whether such fee waiver orreduction shall be granted. (2) A waiver or reduction of fees shall be granted only if release of therequested information to the requester is in the public interest becauseit is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of theoperations or activities of the Agency, and is not primarily in the commercialinterest of the requester. The Agency shall consider the following factorsin determining whether an application for a fee waiver or reduction willbe granted: (i) Does the requested information concern the operations or activitiesof the Agency? (ii) If so, will disclosure of the information be likely to contributeto public understanding of the Agency's operations and activities? (iii) If so, would such a contribution be significant? (iv) Does the requester have a commercial interest that would be furtheredby disclosure of the information? (v) If so, is the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of therequester sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest indisclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest ofthe requester? In applying this criterion, the Agency will weigh the requester'scommercial interest against any public interest in disclosure. Where thereis a public interest in disclosure, and that public interest can fairlybe regarded as being of greater magnitude than the requester's commercialinterest, a fee waiver or reduction will be granted. (3) When a fee waiver application has been included in a request for records,or has been made subsequent thereto, the request shall not be deemed tohave been received until an Agency determination is made regarding thefee waiver application, provided, however, that such determination shallbe made within five working days from the date any such request is receivedby the Agency. (m) The Agency may use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act of 1982(Pub. L. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies andthe use of collection agencies, to encourage payment of delinquent fees.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1215.8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Business information. </ITAG>(a) Business information provided to ACTION by a business submitter shallbe disclosed pursuant to a request under the Act in accordance with thissection. (b) The Agency shall promptly notify a business submitter is writing ofany request for Agency records containing business information. Such writtennotice shall either specifically describe the nature of the business informationrequested or provide copies of the records, or portions thereof containingthe business information. (c) Through the notice required in paragraph (b) of this section, the Agencyshall afford a business submitter a reasonable opportunity to object todisclosure of the information in question, and to provide the Agency witha written statement of grounds for such objection. Such statement shallspecify all grounds for withholding any information under any exemptionof the Act and, in cases where it argues information should be withheldunder exemption (b)(4) of the Act, a business submitter shall state specificallywhy the information is a trade secret or is otherwise protected as proprietarycommercial or financial information. Information provided by a businesssubmitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosureunder the Act.     (d) The Agency shall consider carefully a business submitter's objectionsand specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether torelease requested business information. Whenever the Agency decides todisclose business information over the objection of a business submitter,the Agency shall forward to the business submitter a written notice ofsuch decision, which shall include:(1) The name, and title or position, of the person responsible for denyingthe submitter's objection;(2) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's objectionwas not sustained;(3) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and(4) A specific disclosure date.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Such notice of intent to disclose business information shall be mailedby the Agency not less than six working days prior to the date upon whichdisclosure will occur, with a copy of such notice to the requester.(e) Whenever a requester brings suit to compel disclosure of business information,the Agency shall promptly notify the business submitter.(f) The notice to submitter requirements of this section shall not applyif:(1) The Agency determines that the information shall not be disclosed;(2) The information has previously been published or otherwise lawfullymade available to the public; or(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C.552).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1215.9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appeal procedures.</ITAG>Upon receipt of a notice of denial, a requester may, within 15 calendardays from the date of receipt of such notice, appeal such adverse determinationto the Deputy Director.
