USTRANSCOM, whichis a unified command (i.e., personnel are drawn from all services), wascreated in the fall of 1987 to consolidate the functions of the formerMilitary Transportation Operating Agencies (the Military Airlift Command,the Military Traffic Management Command, and the Military Sealift Command).An important factor justifying creation of USTRANSCOM, was the possibilityof combining and improving coordination in deployment planning betweenthe organizations responsible for strategic transportation activitiesduring times of crisis. This report, the second in a series to be producedin the course of the ORNL study, presents three possibilities for integratingdeliberate and time-sensitive planning. Two proposals recommended foruse by MTMC and MSC build on cooperative planning initiatives alreadyin progress in the two commands. A unique application of relative probabilisticmeasures is a key element in a proposal for improving MTMC/MAC airliftplanning. 35 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
