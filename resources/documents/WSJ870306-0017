The maker of electrical, metalworking and plastic products posted net income of $1.2 million, or 22 cents a share, on sales of $15.7 million, compared with $1 million, or 20 cents a share, on sales of $15.8 million a year earlier.    Per-share figures have been adjusted for a 4-for-3 stock split in February 1986 and a 6% stock dividend last November.    In the six months, the company's profit fell 10% to about $2 million, or 38 cents a share, on sales of $31.4 million, from $2.2 million, or 41 cents a share, on sales of $31.6 million.    John C. Instone, president and chief executive officer, said in an interview that earnings for the second half &quot;will nicely exceed $2 million,&quot; surpassing the year-earlier level of $1.9 million, or an adjusted 36 cents a share, by 15% to 20%.    He also said that new products, a rising backlog of orders and continued cost-cutting should produce record earnings for the fiscal year ending July 31. Mr. Instone expects earnings in the range of 85 cents a share.    In fiscal 1986, SL Industries had a profit from continuing operations of $3.9 million, or 74 cents a share, on sales of $61.9 million. A profit of $145,000 from discontinued operations made net income $4.1 million, or 79 cents a share.    Mr. Instone said the company has an order backlog valued at &quot;about $16.6 million, up from $12.1 million at this time last year.&quot; Initial response has been strong for a new line of uninterruptible power supplies designed for sophisticated electronic equipment, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
