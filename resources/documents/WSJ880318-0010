Mr. Jeanniot said the airline will chose, &quot;I hope within the next few weeks,&quot; among the 737-400 made by Seattle-based Boeing, the MD-88 made by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., and the A-320200 made by Airbus Industrie, a European consortium.    &quot;All three airplanes are still in the running,&quot; Mr. Jeanniot said, commenting on press reports that Air Canada was leaning toward the Airbus.    Mr. Jeanniot said Air Canada plans to buy 34 aircraft to replace its 727s gradually from about late 1989 through early 1993. He said he expects each airplane to cost more than 30 million Canadian dollars ($24 million), with the entire replacement program costing 1.5 billion to 2 billion dollars, including ground equipment.    Separately, a spokeswoman for the Canadair aircraft manufacturing unit of Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. confirmed European press reports that Canadair is negotiating with the French aerospace group Aerospatiale to make fuselage parts for Airbus aircraft. She said talks were &quot;very well advanced&quot; toward a contract that could be valued at as much as $1 billion over 15 years. Bombardier is a maker of transportation equipment.    Mr. Jeanniot said there were &quot;no ties&quot; between Canadair's hoped-for contract and a decision as to whether Air Canada would order the Airbus planes. </TEXT></DOC>
