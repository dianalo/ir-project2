Apple says the suit also &quot;containsnumerous inaccuracies about the Lisa and Macintosh developments&quot; and that theallegations raised in Xerox's 1complaint are similar to defences raised byMicrosoft Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co in Apple's own copyright infringementproceedings.andM;- o -andM;Magnetic disk drive recording head manufacturer National Micronetics Inc,Kingston, New York has laid off about 8% of its employees: the cuts areprimarily in non-production jobs, and are designed to reduce the company'soperating overhead.andM;- o -andM;Ing C Olivetti andamp; Co SpA says that consolidated turnover rose 11% in the first11 months of 1989, but as that is rather lower than it expected, it isthought unlikely that the Italian will be able to meet its target of matchingthe net profit of $276m that it saw last year.andM;- o -andM;Atlantic Computers has confirmed that Barry Graham, Hitachi Data Systems'director of strategic accounts Europe, has been asked to join the company inthe New Year as marketing director for the group.andM;- o -andM;MiniScribe Corp has failed to pay the half-year interest due on its $97.5m of7.5% convertible subordinated debentures: the company had already said thatit was deferring payment for at least the 30-day grace period provided in theTrust Indenture governing the debentures, which expired on Friday, puttingthe company in default on the debt.andM;- o -andM;Comdisco Inc, Rosemont, Illinois plans to buy in up to $25m of its own sharesfor general purposes.andM;- o -andM;IBM is preparing a major change in emphasis for the PS/2 Model 30 series,Newsbytes believes, looking for an announcement next spring: the Model 30 -&quot;worst PC clone I've ever seen&quot; according to Philippe Kahn - sticks out likea sore thumb among the other PS/2s with an XT bus in the 8086 models and ATbus in the 80286 ones, no Micro Channel and no VGA graphics, and thesuggestion is that IBM will move the machine away from the mainstream PS/2range, offering in applications-specific configurations bundled with softwareand printer, so the 50 becomes the entry-level PS/2; the 30s may shed thePS/2 name.andM;- o -andM;Normally associated with the uninspiring world of invoicing, Electronic DataInterchange may now have come to the rescue of independent classical musicproducers feeling the squeeze from the international music publishing groups:a group of French, German and Belgian producers has won backing from theEuropean Commission to develop a network giving producers, distributors andthe public access to an electronic musical catalogue, while cutting costs byallowing the electronic exchange of orders and invoices over the network;GFI, a French division of software services group SD-Scicon Plc, is toundertake the so-called Musik project, for which the Commission has releasedan initial #125,000 funds.andM;- o -andM;East-London-based National Telecommunications Plc has signed a distributionagreement with NTS SA, Nixdorf Computer AG's Spanish subsidiary, which willhave NTS marketing National Telecom's London 8, London 16 and London 64private branch exchanges in Spain under the Nixdorf Keysi badge: NationalTelecom sees the pact as the start of a long-term partnership with Nixdorf.andM;- o -andM;GEC Plc's Marconi Electronic Devices Ltd has formed a French company to lookafter the power semiconductor operations acquired from SGS ThomsonMicroelectronics in 1988.andM;- o -andM;We were far from convinced that Phoenix Group International Inc, Irvine,California really did have a contract for a joint venture to build 6mpersonal computers in the Soviet Union, which is why we dismissed the storyin a downpage Minigram (CI No 1,261), and now the company has acknowledgedthat it does not yet have a contract: John French, president of PhoenixInternational subsidiary American PC Corp is quoted in the Orange CountyRegister as saying that neither American PC nor Phoenix has ever received acontract entitling them to sell 6m personal computers in the USSR orelsewhere; the declaration is part of a legal document filed in connectionwith a lawsuit brought by American PC's minority shareholder and formerchairman, Michael Kolsy, who is accusing Phoenix of illegally trying todilute his interest in American PC; the suit claims that Phoenix and hisformer partners in American PC tried to squeeze him out to avoid having toshare the profits to be derived from the Soviet &quot;contract&quot;.andM;- o -andM;In case anyone is interested, DEC is making a shareholder rights issue thatwould be triggered by a hostile bidder buying more than about 20% of theshares, in which case other holders would have rights to buy additional DECshares at preferential prices, flooding the market with the shares and makingthe aggressor's task harder and more expensive: since the majority ofcomputer companies in the US now have such plans in place - in many casescompanies where it is hard to imagine anyone wanting to buy them! - and sincethis particular type of poison pill has never actually been activated in anyhostile takeover bid, we don't usually trouble readers with any new ones.andM;- o -andM;Rover faces a traumatic Christmas this year if he lives in the pet-owner'shome that has everything, because houseproud pet owners can now keep theirpooches off the furniture or confined to the kitchen even when doors are leftopen: the secret, reports the Daily Mail America column is the Photo-ElectricTalker, a $100 gadget that enables you to record a sharp command so thatwhenever you are out, the thing barks at the poor hound whenever it getswithin 12' of the forbidden bed, chair or whatever.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
