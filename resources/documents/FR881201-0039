The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Coast Guard regulations require the construction of sections of certaintypes of commercial vessels to be of approved structural fire protectionmaterials. The materials approval specifications are contained in SubchapterQ of Title 46 CFR. Materials which have complied with the applicable provisionsof these specifications are issued Certificates of Approval. Traditionally, many materials approved for fire protection purposes havecontained asbestos. As the health hazards of asbestos became known, manufacturersof structural fire protection materials switched from producing asbestos-containingmaterials to asbestos-free substitutes. Now, no asbestos-containing materialsare used.The approval specification for noncombustible materials, 46 CFR 164.009,needs to be revised to formally remove references to asbestos as an acceptablestructural fire protection material. Additionally, this rulemaking proposesto update the list of designated laboratories contained in andSection; 164.009-1.The Coast Guard also proposes to revise 46 CFR 56.25-15, to delete referenceto asbestos-metallic gaskets for high temperature or high pressure pipingsystems. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this proposal are: Mr. KlausWahle, Project Manager, and Lieutenant Commander Don M. Wrye, Project Attorney,Office of Chief Counsel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and nonsignificant under DOT regulatory policies and procedures(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). The economic impact of this proposalis expected to be minimal. The proposed regulations simply delete referencesto asbestos and asbestos-containing materials as acceptable for use invessel construction and as gasket material, and update the list of designatedtesting laboratories for noncombustible materials. Since the use of asbestosis now obsolete, there should be no economic impact on vessel constructionor replacement of gaskets. Accordingly, the Coast Guard certifies thatthe proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. A draft regulatory evaluation has been prepared and placed in the rulemakingdocket. The evaluation may be inspected and copied at the address listedabove under <T2>ADDRESSES.</T2> Copies may also be obtained by contacting the personlisted under <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The proposed regulations do not contain any information collection or recordkeepingrequirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Analysis </ITAG>This rulemaking has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and ithas been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmentaldocumentation in accordance with section 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction(COMDTINST) M16475.1B.
