The army said it had no information on the clash in the villageof Beit Lahiya, where Arab doctors said one Palestinian was killedand two were wounded, one seriously.   Palestinian reporters said the clash broke out after troopstried to reimpose a curfew on the village of 13,000 afterdistributing new, computerized identity cards to residents. Arabdoctors identified the dead man as Jamil Hafez Suleiman, 22, andsaid he was shot in the head.   The death raised to 507 the number of Palestinians killed in the18-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank andGaza Strip. Twenty-two Israelis have also died.   In Jerusalem, about 2,000 mourners waved outlawed Palestinianflags at the funeral of Omar Qassem, 48, a senior figure in thePLO's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Qassem diedon Sunday.   He spent 21 years in Israeli jails for his role in a 1968guerrilla raid and had become a symbol for Palestinians held byIsrael.   Israel radio said 20 Palestinians were detained following astone-throwing protest that broke out after the funeral, whichincluded a three-hour procession through Arab east Jerusalem.   Reporters at the scene watched police fire tear gas to dispersethe demonstrators, who left the funeral shouting, ``We are thefedayeen,'' or guerrillas in Arabic.   Mourners vowed to increase their opposition to the occupationand carried signs saying:``Escalating the Intefadeh will redeemOmar Qassem's blood.'' Intefadeh is Arabic for uprising.   Two Israeli-Arab legislators led the procession. One of them,Abdel Wahab Daroushe, told the mourners after Qassem's body waslowered into the grave: ``In spite of Israel's arrogance, theintefadeh will be victorious.''   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian shop keepers closedtheir doors to mourn Qassem.   The army maintained a curfew in the Gaza Strip for a thirdstraight day and began issuing computerized identity cards thatPalestinians will be required to carry to enter Israel. Arabsdetained for security reasons or convicted of serious crimes willbe denied the entry permits.   The restrictions are designed to exert economic pressure onPalestinian activists. About 50,000 Gazans work in Israel, andthere is little employment in the coastal strip.   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told 500 AmericanJews visiting Israel he was surprised the United States would meetwith PLO officials on Thursday for a third round of talks since thedialogue began in December.   Everything the U.S. government does to ``give the PLO status andlegitimization is counterproductive and cannot possibly helpIsrael's peace initiative,'' Arens said.   Also today, police said Mayor Ron Nachmann of the Jewish WestBank settlement of Ariel apparently did not break the law when heordered Arab laborers to wear badges identifying them as ``alienworkers.''   The police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, wouldnot elaborate. The investigation will continue, he said.   Nachmann backed down after the decision sparked widespreadcriticism and raised comparisons to the yellow Stars of David thatJews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
