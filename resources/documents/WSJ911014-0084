Mr. Miyazawa assured the officialthat Japan wouldn't undercut the new U.S. position publicly-- and then proceeded, with penetrating logic and in eloquentEnglish, to devastate it privately.   &quot;I'm glad that guy is on our side,&quot; an aide recalls theU.S. official remarking after the encounter. &quot;I sure wouldn'twant him for an enemy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Now Mr. Miyazawa is on the verge of becoming primeminister, and while Japan is still on the U.S.'s &quot;side,&quot; U.S.officials can look forward to a far more assertive Japanesevoice on international issues than they've heard under thecurrent Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu.   On Friday, Mr. Miyazawa received support from a leadingLiberal Democratic Party faction, effectively ensuring hisvictory in the election for party president -- and thus primeminister -- scheduled for Oct. 27.   Mr. Miyazawa, 72 years old, is a skilled debater who hasbeen known to go one-on-one with Henry Kissinger and hold hisown. Mr. Kaifu's occasional telephone conversations withGeorge Bush were widely satirized here as a case of theschoolboyish prime minister seeking cues from theprofessional White House diplomat. But Mr. Miyazawa iscapable of having the kind of relationship with the U.S.president that some European leaders have -- and ofoccasionally telling Mr. Bush some things he might not wantto hear.   Few leaders anywhere can equal Mr. Miyazawa's breadth ofgovernment experience. He has been a front-row observer andan important player in Japan's postWorld War II emergence asa global economic power. He traveled to the U.S. in the 1950sas a finance ministry aide and interpreter to senior Japaneseofficials, represented Japan in the so-called Kennedy roundof multinational trade talks in the 1960s, ran the powerfulministry of international trade and industry in the early1970s, attended the first summit of industrialized countriesas foreign minister in 1975, and served as finance ministerduring Japan's adjustment to a dramatically stronger yen inthe late 1980s.   Casual foreign acquaintances tend to assume that, becausehe speaks fluent English and has American friends -- hisdaughter even married a U.S. diplomat -- that Mr. Miyazawa ispro-American. Others suspect he may be outrightanti-American. But the truth seems to be somewherein-between. Close associates say his feelings toward the U.S.are complex, partly because of the sometimes humiliatingtreatment Japanese officials endured during the postwar U.S.occupation and its aftermath.   In his memoirs, published earlier this year, Mr. Miyazawawrites, &quot;It is hard for people today to understand howunpleasant it is to live under an occupation.&quot;   At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Miyazawa soundedconsiderably more comfortable than most of his colleagueswith the idea of a bilateral dialogue with the U.S. thatincludes occasional differences of opinion -- rather than aconstant effort to smile and sweep issues under the rug.   U.S. calls for Japan to alter some of its businesspractices shouldn't be viewed as &quot;interference in ourinternal affairs,&quot; he said. &quot;Japan occupies an importantplace in the global economy, and if we don't harmonize ourpractices with international standards, we won't be able tofill that role.&quot; Likewise, &quot;if we have something to say, weshould speak frankly,&quot; he said. &quot;If we didn't have commonvalues, this would be a problem. But we have a relationshipof trust.&quot;   Despite Mr. Miyazawa's brilliant career, many politicalobservers in Tokyo believed until about two weeks ago that hemight never get his long-awaited shot at the primeministership. As recent events in Tokyo's political backrooms have underscored, the president of the ruling LDP isstill chosen by a handful of party barons. And Mr. Miyazawahas never been particularly popular within that circle.   Yoshiko Ohtaka, chairwoman of the foreign affairscommittee in the Diet's upper house and a member of Mr.Miyazawa's faction, says he is a shy man. &quot;He's serious andnot very chatty, so some people think he's a snob,&quot; she says,&quot;but it's not so.&quot; Colleagues in other LDP factions considerhim cool and aloof, better suited to the elite ranks of thefinance ministry than the hurly-burly of politics.   Still, Mr. Miyazawa has shown that he isn't quite above itall. Along with several other senior LDP figures, he wastarred by the influence-peddling scandal that paved the wayfor Mr. Kaifu to rise from obscurity to the prime minister'spost in 1989. Although the financial favors Mr. Miyazawa andother party leaders received weren't illegal, the disclosuresillustrated the pervasive role of money in politics, andsparked calls for a thorough reform of the electoral systemand fund-raising laws.   After opposing Mr. Kaifu's ill-fated attempt to push apolitical-reform legislative package through the recent Dietsession, Mr. Miyazawa now seems to support the basic elementsof that package.   And to many observers, Mr. Miyazawa now seems to betoadying to the LDP faction of former Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita, which placed Mr. Kaifu in power and supported himthere -- until a few weeks ago. Along with the othercandidates to succeed Mr. Kaifu -- Michio Watanabe andHiroshi Mitsuzuka -- Mr. Miyazawa last week called on IchiroOzawa, the 49-year-old heir apparent to the Takeshitafaction, to explain his policy views and seek the faction'ssupport.   Mr. Miyazawa received that support, greatly enhancing hischances to win the election later this month. But many sawthe spectacle of the older men calling on Mr. Ozawa asevidence that the Takeshita faction -- and, increasingly, Mr.Ozawa -- will continue to call many of the shots. Mr.Miyazawa acknowledges seeking the Takeshita faction'ssupport, but says it will be necessary if he is to unite theparty after the election and pursue his policy goals.   Among those goals will be to ensure that Japan's economy,which recently has slowed notably, keeps growing. &quot;We won'tbe able to make the global economic contribution that isexpected of us if our economy doesn't keep moving,&quot; he said.   A longtime advocate of heavy spending on Japan'sunderdeveloped infrastructure, Mr. Miyazawa indicated hewould be committed to carrying out the sharp increases inpublic-works spending pledged in last year's trade talks withthe U.S.   Although considered dovish on defense issues, Mr. Miyazawasupports the government's legislative proposal to enableJapanese armed forces to participate in certain U.N.peacekeeping operations. He also says he would encouragefurther public debate on how Japan can reconcile its antiwarconstitution with a growing sense that the country should domore to help shoulder the burden of maintaining world order.   In the long run, a Japan that speaks its mind more openlymight be better able to overcome some of the strains thathave developed with the U.S. and other trading partners, someargue.   &quot;At a point when the building of the new internationalorder is on the agenda and when the most important taskbetween Japan and the U.S. is figuring out how we can worktogether, perhaps a {person} with his ability toconceptualize can be a very good prime minister,&quot; says aJapanese bureaucrat who has worked closely with Mr. Miyazawa.</TEXT></DOC>
