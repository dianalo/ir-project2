LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain recommended today that all airlines usingits airports examine passenger's electrical and electronicequipment, following the announcement that a bomb hidden in aradio-cassette player destroyed Pan Am Flight 103.   British Airways, the country's largest airline, immediatelystarted checking radios, portable computers, cassette players andother equipment being checked in, said an airline spokesman, who bycustom is not identified by name.   The Department of Transport said it sent a directive outliningthe suggestion to all airlines operating in Britain on Friday, a dayafter investigators said they believe the cassette-player bomb wasin hold baggage.   Passengers at British Airways counters today were asked to takeall electrical and electronic equipment out of their suitcases for aseparate security check, the airline spokesman said.   Afterward, passengers were asked to carry them aboard the planeas hand baggage, he said.   A Department of Transport spokesman said the directive did notrecommend how the items should be carried on the plane once theywere cleared.   He said the directive was aimed mainly at battery-operatedtransistor radios, lap-top computers and cassette recorders, whereexplosives could be hidden, rather than smaller items such as hairdryers. But the final decision on what should be checked would beleft to the airline, he said.   At this week's meeting in Montreal of the International CivilAviation Organization's governing council, British TransportSecretary Paul Channon outlined an eight-point program to increaseairline security, including checks on electrical equipment, thespokesman said.   The aviation organization unanimously adopted a resolutioncalling for a worldwide tightening of security, including possiblerestrictions on carrying electrical and electronic devices on planes.   The Montreal meeting was requested by Channon and U.S.Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to consider internationalresponses to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. All 259people aboard the New York-bound Boeing 747 were killed along with11 people in the Scottish town of Lockerbie, where much of thewreckage fell.   While the council was meeting, the detective heading theinternational investigation into the Pan Am crash, Detective ChiefSuperintendent John Orr, told a news conference Thursday that thebomb had been planted in a radio-cassette player checked as baggage.   Anti-terrorist experts have said the explosive most likely usedwas Semtex, an odorless, highly malleable substance made inCzechoslovakia.   Orr said there was insufficient evidence to pinpoint the identityof the person or group responsible for planting the bomb.</TEXT></DOC>
