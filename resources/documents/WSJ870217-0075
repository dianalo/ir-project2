The U.S. car makers sold 170,134 cars in the Feb. 1-10 period, down from 172,372 in the like year-ago period, which was relatively strong because of buyer incentives.    On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars were selling at a 7.8 million annual rate in early February, compared with an 8.2 million rate at this time last year. The big difference in the seasonally adjusted rate is due mostly to statistical correction factors that were changed last year by the Commerce Department.    Last December car sales soared, spurred by buyer incentives and a last-minute rush to buy before sales tax deductions expired. January sales, however, were correspondingly weak, analysts said, because sales that normally would have come in that month occurred instead in December.    Now &quot;the hangover from the buying spree is wearing off,&quot; said David Healy, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    The February sales bounce helped the Big Three auto makers reduce their inventory, as expressed in days of supply. A sales analyst for one Big Three company estimated that General Motors Corp. has reduced its days supply to 98 from about 110 at the end of January, while Ford Motor Co. reduced its inventory to 85 days of supply from 99, and Chrysler Corp. trimmed its figure to 110 from 127.    The domestic auto makers normally feel comfortable with a 60-day supply of cars, although the use of buyer incentives has distorted days supply figures during periods of unusually strong and weak sales.    Among the Big Three, GM continued to suffer loss of market share as its sales declined 9% in the period. Ford's sales rose 8.2% while Chrysler's were 1.7% lower. GM's share of the domestic market dropped to 53.3% in the period from 57.8% a year ago; Ford's share rose to 27.3% from 24.9%, and Chrysler's share remained flat at 12.8%.    ---                        Feb. 1-10      Feb. 1-10                          1987           1986        x-%Chg.
