Spear Leeds, a New York-based brokerage partnership that holds a 16.3% stake in Allegheny's $11.25 convertible preferred stock, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it plans &quot;to consider communicating with members of the company's board of directors, other holders of preferred stock, and with prospective acquirers of the company&quot; in an effort to realize fair value for the preferred shares of the Pittsburgh-based consumer and industrial products company.    The brokerage firm didn't say what price it is interested in getting for its stock. The filing did caution, however, that Spear Leeds has &quot;no plans concerning any specific course it may pursue&quot; and continues to hold its Allegheny stock as an investment.    As previously reported, Spear Leeds refused to tender its stake to Sunter Acquisition Corp., a unit of New York-based First Boston Inc. that recently made an offer for all of Allegheny's shares. The failed offer, which expired last Thursday, called for holders to receive $24.60 for each Allegheny common share, $20 for each $2.19 cumulative preference share and $87.50 for each $11.25 convertible preferred share.    Allegheny's board, which had approved Sunter's offer last month, met late yesterday to discuss its options in the wake of the failed offer. The company declined to comment on the meeting and the Spear Leeds filing.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Allegheny common shares rose 75 cents to close at $22.75. </TEXT></DOC>
