Olson put deregulation of the company's highly profitable long distance business at the top. Despite probable opposition from consumer groups, he may get most of what he wants.    While total deregulation is unlikely, regulators, ATandamp;T competitors and telecommunications consultants increasingly in the past few months have adopted ATandamp;T's fallback point of view, calling for a regulatory mechanism that caps the prices ATandamp;T charges rather than limits its profit. The company suggests tying prices to the Consumer Price Index, say those who have met with ATandamp;T. The new method would beef up ATandamp;T's earnings and, possibly, those of its competitors.    The Federal Communications Commission likely will propose removing ATandamp;T from profit regulation at its Aug. 4 meeting, says Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau. Given necessary procedural delays, any new regulatory scheme probably wouldn't go into effect until sometime next year or early 1989.    Anticipation that a regulatory change will substantially boost ATandamp;T's profit is the main reason behind the heavy trading and recent new highs in ATandamp;T stock, securities analysts say. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the shares have traded as high as $29.25 on daily volume that in one case exceeded seven million shares. Yesterday, ATandamp;T closed at $28.125, unchanged, with almost five million shares changing hands.    But while the industry and regulators are reaching a consensus, consumer groups, including big businesses, say there is little if any public benefit from capping prices instead of profit. Long distance rates, which have fallen more than 30% since the Bell System breakup, probably wouldn't fall as fast, and prices for services that ATandamp;T still monopolizes would probably rise, they say.    &quot;Rates have been artificially depressed&quot; because of rate-of-return regulation that lets ATandamp;T earn only 12.2% on its $9.1 billion interstate long distance investment, acknowledges John Hoffman, a senior vice president at US Sprint Communications Co. In recent weeks, US Sprint has said it favors removing ATandamp;T from profit regulation, and in March MCI Communications Corp. said it supported lessened regulation of ATandamp;T.    Despite the likelihood of consumer-group complaints, a regulatory change is likely because regulators by their own admission can't police ATandamp;T's earnings anyway. In addition, ATandamp;T found a powerful ally this spring in Dennis R. Patrick, the ambitious new chairman of the FCC. Mr. Patrick, observers say, is most anxious to put his personal stamp on FCC policy before the Reagan administration leaves office in a year and a half. The 36-year-old Mr. Patrick wasn't available to be interviewed.    To build a consensus before formal consideration of a regulatory change, ATandamp;T executives have been seeking meetings with consumer groups, FCC staffers and congressional aides. &quot;They're running around town trying to size up where everyone is and what buttons they have to push to avoid extensive criticism of this idea,&quot; says Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of America in Washington.    ATandamp;T argues that the removal of profit caps would allow it to become more efficient and make more money, says Brian Moir, counsel to the International Communications Association, which represents organizations whose phone bills are more than $1 million a month. &quot;Our question was, 'What's in it for the user?' and for that, they (ATandamp;T) didn't have a lot of answers,&quot; he says.    Because ATandamp;T is as dominant a long distance supplier as it was three years ago, according to an exhaustive study prepared last year for the Justice Department, profit caps are necessary to ensure that prices reflect the industry's declining costs, says Mr. Kimmelman. Indeed, one of the biggest disappointments of the Bell System breakup has been the failure of competitors to create enough price competition to make big inroads into ATandamp;T's market position. ATandamp;T executives themselves have said publicly that competition in the industry is still nascent. Most chilling are observations by analysts that the market might be a natural monopoly after all.    &quot;If a price cap (approach) is predicated on having a competitive market, we aren't sure there is a competitive market,&quot; says Gerard Salemme, senior telecommunications policy analyst for the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. &quot;If consumers perceive this will only raise profits to long distance carriers and raise prices, Congress will respond to that type of issue.&quot;    While price cap regulation may make some sense in theory, even its proponents admit that in practice it raises a slew of problems. No one yet is sure where to set the caps in the first place, how to adjust them in coming years and how to ensure that some of ATandamp;T's productivity gains are passed on to consumers.    &quot;I don't support the whole idea of deregulation&quot; of ATandamp;T, says James M. Thompson, manager of consumer affairs for the American Association of Retired Persons. &quot;Competition is so shaky in the long distance field right now and ATandamp;T is so strong. If in five years the competitors to ATandamp;T are out of business for whatever reason, then we are left with an unregulated monopoly. And that is unacceptable.&quot;    ATandamp;T, whose executives declined to be interviewed, is informally suggesting prices be tied to the CPI, and that ATandamp;T be allowed to keep part of any reductions in the cost of connecting long distance lines to local phone companies, say those who have met with the company.    In addition, consumer groups say, the company wants to set different prices in different geographic regions when forced to by competition. Publicly, ATandamp;T executives have said that for three years ATandamp;T wouldn't geographically de-average rates and would continue to lower its rates to fully reflect declines in connection charges.    Consumer groups thus far are finding few of ATandamp;T's ideas palatable. Phone rates in the past 50 years have risen only one-fourth as much as the CPI, according to a recent FCC study, and reductions in local connection charges are the main reason long distance prices have declined so markedly in the past three years. Indeed, ATandamp;T says such connection charges account for half its costs.    As for ATandamp;T's anticipated productivity gains, there is talk in Washington about developing a &quot;productivity index&quot; that will force ATandamp;T to partly reflect in its prices increased operating efficiencies gained by the price cap approach.    Nonetheless, says Mr. Brock of the FCC, current profit regulation is inefficient because it encourages ATandamp;T to pad its costs. And, say other administration officials, the incessant haggling involved in profit regulation makes it far more costly and complicated than a price cap.    While the FCC is supposed to regulate costs to prevent padding, it has a hard time doing so, Mr. Brock says. &quot;There has to be some fairly clear evidence that costs aren't properly incurred,&quot; says Mr. Brock. &quot;Costs like an extra vice president we probably are never going to detect.&quot; In any event, he says, &quot;if we thought prices would decline faster under (profit) regulation than under the price cap approach, we would continue with (profit) regulation.&quot;    ATandamp;T says profit regulation has been removed in 12 states; in 10 of those, its instate long distance prices have fallen an average of 10%. And although ATandamp;T's confidence in its ability to compete helped lead it to call for decreased regulation, ATandamp;T executives have said that competitors have made some inroads among 25% of its residential customers that spend more than $25 a month and 55% of its business customers that spend more than $100 a month.    Removal of profit regulation from ATandamp;T may spur the same change in regulation of the regional Bell operating companies and GTE Corp.'s local phone companies, analysts say. ATandamp;T in March said it supported such a move for the Bell concerns, though it vehemently opposes entry of the Bells into the long distance business.    Those statements are consistent with the strategy laid out last fall by Mr. Olson. ATandamp;T has seen it could effectively compete against Sprint and MCI at a higher price level than it thought possible, says one former ATandamp;T executive. Consequently, it constantly bumps up against the profit cap set by the FCC, forcing it to lower prices or pad costs and putting futher pressure on MCI and Sprint. Removing profit regulation, as long as the Bells are kept from competing, will allow ATandamp;T to cut costs and boost earnings. &quot;There is no public benefit,&quot; says this former ATandamp;T executive. &quot;The ATandamp;T shareowner is the beneficiary.&quot;    ---   Long Distance Market Share                           1985      1986*     1987* ATandamp;T                     67.8%      65.3%     63.4% MCI                       5.3        6.6       7.9 US Sprint                 2.9        3.8       4.5 Baby Bells (intrastate)             14.1       13.6      13.0 Other                     9.9       10.7      11.0 TOTAL (In billions           $56.65     $61.67     $66.69 of dollars)   *Estimate   Source: The Yankee Group</TEXT></DOC>
