However, only limited parametric studieshave been performed to evaluate the challenge of these organic compoundstoward the currently installed adsorbent beds in nuclear power plantair cleaning systems. Initial evaluation of adsorbents has indicatedthat the removal properties of commercial adsorbents is different fororganic compounds other than methyl iodide. Tests were performed usingdi-iodomethane, iodoethane, iodopropane and iodo benzene. Adsorbentsevaluated included stable iodine alone, amine alone and coimpregnatedcarbons. The results indicated that there are significant differences,i.e., lower removal efficiencies for these compounds compared to methyliodide and also for the individual species depending on the impregnant.An explanation for these differences is offered based on isotope exchangerates for the various species and the fact that one or several of thesespecies may be responsible for the penetrating iodine species suspectedto be present by others in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
