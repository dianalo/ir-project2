A summary of the major provisionsalong with explanatory statements was included in the NPRM. In addition to minor editorial and technical revisions, there are somemajor differences between the NPRM and these final regulations. The majordifferences are: andbullet; The definition of an ``impartial hearing officer'' has been revisedto require that the individual not have a personal or financial interestthat would affect the individual's objectivity. andbullet; The grounds for granting extensions of time during the formalappeals process are limited to two circumstances: joint request of theparties or good cause shown by a party. andbullet; The definition of ``initial expenditure'' has been changed torequire that reallotted funds be obligated by November 15 of the subsequentfiscal year. andbullet; To be eligible to receive realloted funds a State must assurethat it will be able to obligate fully all of its original allotment offunds by the end of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated.andbullet; The definition of ``extreme medical risk'' has been revised toindicate that functional impairment may be increased, rather than caused,by delay in providing services. andbullet; Determinations of ``extreme medical risk'' must be based uponmedical evidence provided by an appropriate licensed medical professional.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 61 parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and ofthe changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Major issues are grouped according to subject, with appropriate sectionsof the regulations referenced in parentheses. Other substantive issuesare discussed under the sections of the regulations to which they pertain.Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary isnot legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_arenot addressed. Comments that discussed provisions of Part 361 that werenot included in the NPRM also have not been addressed. Appeals Procedures, Section 361.48 <T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received a number of comments on the proceduresin andSection; 361.48 that revise the requirements for State appeals proceduresif applicants or recipients request a review of State determinations regardingthe furnishing or denial of services. Some commenters stated that the length of time permitted for the appealsprocess is too long. Some commenters recommended shortening the time allowedfor specific steps in the appeal process or including an expedited procedurefor certain types of appeals. Some commenters also recommended that a provisionbe added requiring States to continue to provide disputed services duringthe appeal process. Some commenters were concerned that proposed andSection;361.48(b), which permits extensions of time at the request of a party,could result in lengthy delays in the appeals process. Some commentersrecommended limiting the circumstances under which an extension would begranted. One commenter was concerned that the 45-day time period for adue process hearing would adversely affect a State's ability to resolvedisagreements informally. Some commenters also felt that applicants andrecipients should be given notice of the procedures in andSection; 361.48.<T3>Discussion: </T3>While the Secretary recognizes the concerns aboutthe length of time for the appeals procedure, no change has been made inthe specific timeframes included in andSection; 361.48. These timeframesare either statutorily required or are based upon timeframes similar tothose in effect in the State special education program. The Secretary agreesthat a change should be made to the provision concerning extensions oftime, which has been revised to permit extensions for good cause shownor at the request of both parties. The final regulations make clear thatextensions of time can only occur in these two circumstances. Because extensionsof time can only be granted at the request of a party, the hearing officercannot unilaterally delay the formal appeal process. The Secretary agrees that the regulations should be changed to inform applicantsand clients of the rights and procedures available to them. He also agreesthat the regulation should be revised to clarify that the informal reviewmay not be used to delay any of the timeframes in andSection; 361.48(c)(2).Of course, if the applicant or the client and the agency are involved ininformal negotiations during any stage of a formal appeal under andSection;361.48(c), they can jointly request an extension of time, if they believethis is in their best interest.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 361.48 has been restructured to require in anew subsection (a) that applicants and clients be informed of their opportunitiesfor appeal. The use of informal reviews, previously authorized in subsection(d), has been relocated to a new subsection (b), which makes it clear thatsuch reviews cannot delay the formal appeal process unless both partiesjointly agree to the delay. Formal appeal procedures are now containedin subsection (c). The extension of time provisions are now located atsubsection (d). The final regulations permit time extensions on two groundsonly: At joint request of both parties or for good cause shown by a party.Regulatory provisions relating to the State fair hearing board and mandatorydata collections are in subsections (e) and (f). Definition of Impartial Hearing Officer, Section 361.1(c)(2) <T3>Comments: </T3>A number of comments were received on the proposed definitionof ``impartial hearing officer.'' Most of the comments concerned the provisionthat precludes an employee of an agency involved in any decision regardingthe furnishing or denial of rehabilitation services to a rehabilitationapplicant or recipient from serving as a hearing officer. A number of commentersopposed the provision because they believed it would be difficult to findqualified individuals to serve as hearing officers if agency employeeswere excluded from consideration. Recognizing that this is a concern, somecommenters made suggestions about how to recruit people with the knowledgeand skills to serve as hearing officers who were not agency employees.A number of other commenters strongly supported excluding agency employeesfrom serving as hearing officers. Several of these commenters were concernedthat the proposed definition might permit agency contractors to serve ashearing officers. Some commenters were also concerned that former agencyemployees, particularly former agency directors, might be appointed ashearing officers. They expressed concern about whether former employeeswould be biased toward the position of the agency. Some commenters askedfor further clarification of the provision that a hearing officer is notan employee solely because the hearing officer is paid by the agency forthe purpose of conducting hearings. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes the regulatory provision prohibitingagency employees from serving as hearing officers is a reasonable interpretationof the statutory requirement for impartiality and is consistent with theRehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 and the accompanying legislativehistory. Based upon the experience in the State special education programs,the Secretary also believes that a sufficient number of appropriately trainedindividuals who are not agency employees will be available to serve ashearing officers; therefore, no change has been made in this provisionof the regulations. The Secretary also does not believe that further guidanceis necessary on the provision that states that an individual is not anemployee solely because the individual is paid by the agency to serve asa hearing officer. The Secretary agrees that agency contractors and, undercertain circumstances, former employees may have a potential conflict ofinterest that could affect their ability to serve as an impartial hearingofficer. Generally, contractors will have a personal or financial interestthat will preclude them from serving as hearing officers. <T3>Changes: </T3>The Secretary has changed subparagraph (iv) of the definitionto clarify that individuals with a personal or financial interest thatwould conflict with their objectivity may not serve as a hearing officer.``Rehabilitation Engineering'', Sections 361.1, 361.32(c) <T3>Comments: </T3>A number of commenters recommended that the Secretaryexpand the definition of rehabilitation engineering in andSection; 361.1.A number of commenters recommended that the definition include lists ofspecific services. One commenter asked the Secretary to clarify what, ifany, difference there is between ``rehabilitation engineering'' and ``rehabilitationengineering services.'' Some commenters requested that the Secretary specify that other professionalsbesides rehabilitation engineers could make appropriate assessments ofthe need for rehabilitation engineering services. They pointed out that,in some instances, these determinations are also made by occupational therapists.Some commenters also suggested that the evaluation requirements of andSection;361.32(c) specify that the evaluation is of the potential to benefit fromrehabilitation engineering services. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Although the Secretary believes that the definitionof rehabilitation engineering provides sufficient guidance, the Secretarybelieves further guidance on the nature and purpose of the evaluation wouldadd clarity to this requirement. <T3>Changes: </T3>A change has been made to andSection; 361.32(c) to requireevaluations by ``qualified personnel of the potential to benefit from rehabilitationengineering services.'' Definitions, Section  361.1 <T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters recommended changes in the definitionsof ``supported employment,'' ``competitive work,'' and ``on-going supportservices.'' To ensure consistency in the provision of supported employmentservices under the Title I program and the new State Supported EmploymentServices program under Title VI, Part C (final regulations for this programwere published as 34 CFR Part 363 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 14, 1987, at 52 FR 30546), the proposedregulations incorporated in andSection; 361.1(c)(2) the same definitionsthat were adopted in the supported employment program. The comments receivedin response to this regulation were very similar to the comments that werereceived in response to the Supported Employment NPRM and were discussedin the preamble to the final regulations for that program. Two commentersalso asked what standards will be used to interpret ``other gainful work''which is included in the definition of employability. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that it is essential to ensureconsistency between the Title I program and the State Supported EmploymentServices program in interpreting these terms. Determinations of whetheran activity is ``other gainful work'' will be made on a case-by-case basis.<T3>Changes: </T3>No change has been made. Public Participation in Formulation of State Plans, Section 361.18 <T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters noted that sec. 101(a)(23)(A) ofthe Act requires the State plan to provide satisfactory assurances that``in the formulation of policies governing the provision of rehabilitationservices,'' the State agency will conduct public meetings to allow interestedgroups and individuals to comment on the State plan. They recommended thatandSection; 361.18(a)(1) be revised to make clear that consultation mustoccur during policy development. Comments were also received recommendingthat andSection; 361.18(a)(3) require a written description of other proceduresfor receiving comment and that this provision specifically require consultationwith Client Assistance Programs (CAPs).<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that Congress intended to requirepublic participation in the formulation of policy at the State plan stageand at subsequent stages. The Secretary also believes the regulations shouldrequire a written description of other procedures the State agency willuse in obtaining and considering public comment on State plan and policydevelopment. Because CAPs are clearly included as ``others interested invocational rehabilitation,'' the Secretary believes that they are alreadycovered by andSection; 361.18(c)(1)(iii); therefore, there is no need toinclude a specific requirement in the regulations to consult with the CAPs.<T3>Changes: </T3>A change has been made to andSection; 361.18(a)(1) specificallyto include ``formulation of'' policies. In andSection; 361.18(a)(3) ``othermethods'' has been changed to ``procedures.'' Individualized Written Rehabilitation Program, Sections 361.40-361.41 <T3>Comments: </T3>A number of comments were received recommending changesto or clarification of the requirements for an individualized written rehabilitationprogram (IWRP). One commenter recommended that States be required to makethe IWRPs available in taped form or in braille. Some commenters felt thata number of provisions concerning the need for post-employment serviceswere unnecessary. The commenters recommended that only a post-employmentassessment be completed and appropriate services be provided. One commenterrecommended deleting the provision in andSection; 361.40(a) requiring thatsuitable professional or informed advisors be included in the preparationof the IWRP. Some commenters asked for clarification on who designatesthese individuals. Apparently these commenters were concerned that thisprovision might be interpreted to permit the VR agency to select theseindividuals. Clarification was also requested by a number of commenterson the relationship between andSection; 361.41(b)(1), which conditions time-limitedsupported employment services to no more than 18 months, and andSection;361.41(a)(13), which provides for post-employment services. One commenterrecommended clarification in andSection; 361.40(a) that the designated Stateunit staff member is the vocational rehabilitation counselor or coordinator.Some commenters also felt an absolute 18-month limitation on time-limitedsupported employment services and the 20 hour requirement in the definitionof competitive work were inconsistent with the requirements of section504 of the Rehabilitation Act which prohibits discrimination against personswith handicaps by the Federal Government and in programs or activitiesreceiving Federal financial assistance. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The provisions concerning post-employment servicesare based upon the statutory requirements and are necessary to implementthose requirements. The provision requiring that suitable advisors or professionalsbe included in the development of the IWRP is clearly intended to permitthe individual with handicaps, or the individual and a parent or guardian,to include suitable professionals or informed advisors that they have chosen.The Secretary believes that the regulations provide sufficient guidanceon the relationship of time-limited services and post-employment services.Individuals in supported employment will need post-employment servicesthroughout the period of their employment. The use of time-limited servicesis intended to distinguish those short term services that are the responsibilityof the VR agency from those on-going long term services that are the responsibilityof other service systems. Post-employment services are intended to be occasionalservices needed by an individual with handicaps but are not intended tobe of the intensity or duration of on-going supported employment services.The Secretary believes that the definition of competitive work and the18-month limitation on time-limited supported employment services are consistentwith section 504 and that changes to these provisions are not required.In developing both the definition of competitive work and the 18-monthlimitation, the Secretary has provided considerable flexibility for adaptingrehabilitation programs to meet the needs of eligible individuals. In addition,these requirements are consistent with the Rehabilitation Act Amendmentsof 1986 and the legislative history and were based upon available datafrom discretionary grant supported employment projects. The Secretary agrees that andSection; 361.40(a) should be clarified to makeclear that the vocational rehabilitation counselor or coordinator is involvedin the development of the IWRP. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 361.40(a) has been revised to specifically providethat the vocational rehabilitation counselor or coordinator must be involvedin the development of the IWRP. Comparable Services, Section 361.47 <T3>Comments: </T3>A number of comments were received recommending changesin andSection; 361.47(b), which requires States to assure that, before vocationalrehabilitation services are provided, a determination is made whether comparablebenefits and services are available under any other programs. The proposedregulations provide for a number of exceptions to this requirement. Some commenters asked for clarification of the effect of student aid programson the comparable benefits provisions. One commenter asked if failure tofile for student aid in a timely manner would result in a denial of rehabilitationservices under the comparable benefits requirement. Several commenters recommended changes in proposed andSection; 361.47(b)(3),which provides that a determination of the availability of comparable benefitsneed not be made before services are provided, if a licensed medical professionaldecides that a delay in services resulting from the determination of theavailability of comparable services would cause an individual with handicapsto be at extreme medical risk. Commenters recommended changes such as notrequiring a determination prior to providing services if this would resultin a delay in services. Another commenter recommended that the provisionbe revised to conform more closely to the statutory provision in the RehabilitationAct Amendments. The commenter noted that the proposed provision appearsto require that the delay in services be the cause of an extreme medicalrisk. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that the statutory standardshould be followed in deciding whether services should be provided beforea determination of the availability of comparable benefits has been made.The Secretary believes that the proposed regulations did not provide sufficientclarity about the ``extreme medical risk'' exception. The Secretary hasdetermined that further guidance on the issues concerning student aid neednot be included in the regulations. The Secretary will determine whetherfurther policy guidance should be provided by the Department. <T3>Changes: </T3>A change has been made in andSection; 361.47(b)(3) to eliminatethe apparent cause-and-effect relationship between delay in providing servicesand the individual being at extreme medical risk.Reallotments, Section 361.87 <T3>Comments: </T3>Section 361.87 established procedures for the Secretaryto reallot funds when a determination is made that one or more States willbe unable to use all of the rehabilitation funds that have been allottedto them. A commenter recommended States be required to assure that theywill be able to use additional funds to be eligible to receive reallottedfunds. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that a requirement that Statesassure that they will be able to obligate all of their original allotmentby the end of the fiscal year will help to ensure more effective distributionof reallotted funds. States that are unable to provide this assurance willnot be eligible to receive reallotted funds. <T3>Changes: </T3>A change has been made to andSection; 361.87 to requirethat, to receive reallotted funds, States must assure that they will beable to obligate fully all of their initial allotment by the end of thefiscal year for which the funds were appropriated. Order of Selection for Services, Section 361.2(b)(2)(iv) <T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters requested further clarification ofandSection; 361.2(b)(2)(iv) which requires the State Plan to include a descriptionof and justification for the order to be used in selecting groups of individualswith handicaps to be provided vocational rehabilitation services if servicescannot be provided to all eligible individuals. Section 361.36(b) alsorequires that individuals with the most severe handicaps be selected forservices before other eligible individuals. Commenters were concerned thatandSection; 361.2(b)(2)(iv) might be interpreted to mean that individualswith certain types of handicapping conditions would be given priority,as a group, over individuals with other types of handicapping conditions.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the phrase ``groups of''should be omitted for the reasons given by the commenters. <T3>Changes: </T3>The phrase ``groups of'' has been omitted from andSection;361.2(b)(2)(iv). Initial Expenditure, Section 361.1 (Section 361.87) <T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that the definitionof an initial expenditure was unclear. Commenters expressed concern aboutthe use of the term ``first cash outlay'' which they felt was not a commonlyused term. Commenters also recommended that the definition use the term``obligation'' because it is a more commonly used term. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees the term ``initial expenditure''should be clarified and that the term ``obligation'' should be used insteadof ``first cash outlay''. The definition of initial expenditure has beenrevised to require that reallotted funds be obligated no later than November15 of the subsequent fiscal year. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 361.1 has been revised to define initial expendituresas obligations of reallocated funds made by November 15 of the subsequentfiscal year. Extreme Medical Risk, Section 361.1 (Section 361.47(b)(3)) <T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern about the definitionof extreme medical risk. Commenters were also concerned about the proceduresfor determining whether an individual is at extreme medical risk. Commentersexpressed concern that the definition in the NPRM was much more restrictivethan the statutory standard because it appears to require a causal relationshipbetween delay in providing services and the adverse effects on the individual.A commenter was also concerned about whether all licensed medical professionalswere the appropriate individuals to make assessments of extreme medicalrisk. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the definition of extrememedical risk in the NPRM is misleading and should be clarified. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 361.47(b)(3) has been revised to provide thata determination of extreme medical risk is based upon medical evidenceprovided by an appropriate licensed medical professional. The definitionof ``extreme medical risk'' in andSection; 361.1 has also been revised toreflect that functional impairment may be increased, rather than caused,by dalay in providing services. Reassessment, Section 361.41(a)(7) <T3>Comments: </T3>Some commenters recommended changing andSection; 361.41(a)(7)to require that a reassessment of the need for post-employment servicesbe completed prior to case closure. They consider andSection; 361.41(a)(7)as proposed, which requires a schedule and procedure for reassessment,to be unnecessarily burdensome. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the changes proposed bythe commenters clearly establish the obligation to perform an assessmentprior to case closure without imposing unnecessarily burdensome requirementsupon rehabilitation agencies. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 361.41(a)(7) has been changed to require a reassessmentof the need for post-employment services prior to case closure rather thana procedure and schedule for reassessment. Other Comments <T3>Comments: </T3>Comments were received recommending that referencesin the NPRM to ``recipients'' be changed to ``clients'' because ``client''is the term that is generally used in rehabilitation programs. Commentswere also received recommending that references to ``ANSI'' and the ``DevelopmentalDisabilities Act of 1984'' be revised to reflect that the ANSI standardshave been superseded and the Developmental Disabilities Act was amendedin 1987. Commenters also asked why the regulations did not include anyprovisions concerning the statement in the Conference Report that ``Nothingin the Conference Report prohibits any individual from pursuing a privateright of action''. The same commenters asked why the data collection requirementsconcerning review of rehabilitation counselor or coordinator determinationshad not been included. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the term client rather thanrecipient should be used in the regulations. The term client appears inother sections of the regulations and is generally used in rehabilitationprograms. The Secretary also agrees that the changes should be made tothe references to ANSI and the Developmental Disabilities Act of 1984,as amended. The Secretary believes that issues concerning the existenceof a private action are issues that must be addressed by the courts andare not an appropriate subject for inclusion in these regulations. Thedata collection requirements are included in andSection; 361.48(f). <T3>Changes: </T3>The term recipient has been replaced by the term clientin andSection; 361.48 and references to ANSI have been revised to refer tothe Uniform Accessibility Standards. The citations to the DevelopmentalDisabilities Act of 1984, as amended, have also been revised. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291.
