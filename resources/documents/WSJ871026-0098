Frankly, we think it's just as well. In fact, President Reagan should take the chance to walk away from the nearly complete agreement on intermediate nuclear forces.    The INF agreement has a fatal flaw, and is almost certain to boomerang on the President in the publicity wars that are the essence of arms control. Mr. Reagan keeps heralding INF as &quot;history's first agreement to eliminate an entire class of U.S. nuclear missiles.&quot; In fact, while the agreement would eliminate a class of missiles, it would do so only after the nuclear parts are removed and saved. The real meaning of zero option is that zero is the number of nuclear weapons eliminated.    How will this play as it is more widely understood by the public? Consider a colloquy between Secretary Shultz and Leslie Stahl on &quot;Face the Nation&quot; in September. Ms. Stahl asked about the Soviets' statement that they'd demand elimination of the &quot;warheads&quot; in the Pershing missiles the Germans agreed to give up.    &quot;There's a lot of misunderstanding about what the word 'warhead' means,&quot; Secretary Shultz explained. &quot;There is something called a re-entry vehicle, the whole thing that comes back into the atmosphere with the ballistic missile -- and that consists of a case, you might say, inside of which is an explosive and guidance system. You will find that the Soviets want to do just as we do, to take the re-entry vehicle and take the explosive device out of it -- it's a very secret, intricate thing -- and bring that back to our own territory. They want to do that just as much as we do.&quot;    &quot;Well,&quot; Ms. Stahl persisted, &quot;if they offer to destroy their warheads, would we go along with them?&quot; The Secretary answered, &quot;I believe what they really mean by that is the re-entry vehicle, the shell, so to speak, after you have taken the explosive device out of it. At least that's what they tabled in Geneva.&quot; She asked the question again, he answered again.    &quot;I'm still confused, I'm unclear,&quot; the questioner said again. &quot;Have they offered to destroy theirs?&quot; The Secretary replied, &quot;They have said that they want to take that, what would be a re-entry vehicle, and take the weapon, what we think of as the weapon, out of it.&quot; Two questions later, he concluded, &quot;The difference between what they have been saying publicly and what they precisely table in Geneva is to be noted.&quot;    No doubt President Reagan would have received a media boost from a summit to sign the INF. But he, his aides and his family need to understand that as soon as the smoke cleared, they would have to start explaining the difference between &quot;warheads,&quot; &quot;re-entry vehicles&quot; and &quot;explosive charges.&quot; The Great Communicator would be called upon to explain that the &quot;nuclear-missiles&quot; elimination doesn't include the part that causes nuclear explosions. That he never meant &quot;what we think of as the weapon,&quot; but just the missiles and the &quot;shell.&quot; Is this really how he wants to spend the rest of his presidency?    In fact, the explosive charges would go on newer and better missiles. The Soviets already have their SS-24s and SS-25s ready. The U.S. someday hopes to use its warheads in the MX. The agreement would, however, prevent the U.S. from raising the nuclear threshold by deploying ground-launched cruise missiles with conventional warheads, since both conventional and nuclear-armed missiles are prohibited in the name of verification. Whether this would limit the Soviets is doubtful; since no one can really verify whether a new cruise missile is &quot;intermediate&quot; range, there is an open invitation to deception and cheating.    None of this is surprising; the INF agreement founders on reality like other arms-control agreements before it. Ponder for a moment the question, How would the parties go about destroying nuclear warheads even if they agreed to? Explode them? Bury them? Plutonium has a half-life of more than 20,000 years. The best answer probably would be to burn them in nuclear-power plants, an unlikely prospect for verification. And, of course, the parties would still be producing weapons-grade fissionable material for other weapons.    Arms-control enthusiasts are unlikely to pause over these hard realities. When they learn that no nuclear weapons have been eliminated, they will blame Ronald Reagan for going back on his own rhetoric about a denuclearized world. The lesson they will learn is not that arms control with a determined adversary is unlikely, but that Reagan arms control is a sham.    In the world these columns recognize, the threat is not nuclear weapons but Soviet weapons -- in particular, the conventional tank armies that threaten to plunder Europe instead of mindlessly destroying it. But we have to agree that the likely complaint of the arms-control enthusiasts has a point: If this agreement doesn't eliminate any nuclear weapons, just what is the argument for signing it? </TEXT></DOC>
