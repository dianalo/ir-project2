American officials fear that if war starts between theU.S. and Iraq, U.S. citizens in those countries could bevulnerable to both Iraq-inspired terrorist attacks and toviolence and harassment from local governments or pro-Iraqimobs.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, a senior U.S. military intelligence officer inSaudi Arabia predicted that Iraq's leader would defy theUnited Nations demand that he pull his army out of Kuwait byJan. 15. The U.N. has sanctioned the use of force to oustIraqi troops after that date. Air Force Lt. Col. Tom Coury,appearing at a military news conference in Riyadh, said, &quot;Wepresently assess that Saddam Hussein intends to remain inKuwait for the long haul.&quot;   Yesterday, the State Department ordered all &quot;nonessential&quot;U.S. government employees and all dependents of governmentemployees, to leave Jordan and Sudan. It also urged all otherAmericans to leave the two countries, whose governmentssympathize with Iraq, &quot;well before&quot; Jan. 15.   The U.S. already had been evacuating U.S. employees andurging private Americans to leave Yemen, a third ally ofIraq's. Also, the department has authorized -- but notordered -- the departure of government dependents andnonessential government workers from Mauritania.   The department also has encouraged the departure ofdependents of U.S. government employees from Arab countriesthat are friendly to the U.S. but close to the potentialbattlefront. They include Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates,Qatar and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.   In Saudi Arabia, Lt. Col. Coury said at the first in aplanned series of military news conferences there that Iraqileader Saddam Hussein is spending so much of his scarceresources digging into Kuwait that a peaceful withdrawal isunlikely.   &quot;One of the things you look at as an intelligence officeris how a man is spending his resources,&quot; Lt. Col. Coury toldreporters. &quot;You're looking at an economy that's embargoedright now, and this man is spending tremendous resources tobuild defenses in Kuwait and on his western flank,&quot; he said.&quot;And that suggests to me that he has all intentions ofremaining there.&quot;   Lt. Col. Coury also said a chemical-weapons attack on U.S.and allied forces is &quot;likely&quot; if war breaks out, that Iraqhas installed Silkworm missiles to strike at U.S. ships, andthat it is &quot;very realistic&quot; to expect Iraq to try to attackIsrael if war starts.   Meanwhile, President Bush is scheduled to return from thepresidential retreat at Camp David today for staffconsultations on the Persian Gulf as well as other routinebusiness, the White House said. Aides wouldn't identify withwhom the president planned to meet; they said he is expectedto resume his vacation in midafternoon.</TEXT></DOC>
