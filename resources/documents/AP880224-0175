Republican also-ran Jack Kemp vowed he, too, would press ondespite an 0-5 record. Unlike Simon, the New York congressman saidhe would take his chances in the clump of primaries in the Southand elsewhere on March 8.   ``I'm in this all the way to New Orleans'' and the GOPconvention in August, said Kemp in Beaufort, S.C.   ``It is on to Atlanta'' and the Democratic convention in July,echoed Simon at a Washington news conference.   Simon, the Illinois senator, has yet to win a Democratic event,watching Massachusetts Michael Dukakis and Missouri Rep. RichardGephardt split the early contests. So he said he will skip theSouth and focus on his home state primary on March 15, one weekafter Super Tuesday.   ``The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting inIllinois,'' Simon said.   Money is the problem Simon sees in the South.   ``There is no sense in my fooling myself,'' the IllinoisDemocrat said. ``We just don't have the money.''   Simon's campaign plunged into debt before the New Hampshireprimary, but he has collected close to half a million dollars inthe past two weeks.   ``We have had record-breaking fund-raising,'' Simon said.``Monday, for example, $137,000 came in. We never had a day likethat before. But you take $137,000 and then look at 20 states andwhat it would cost for a media buy, and you're talking aboutsomething that is nowhere near adequate.''   ``I'm not writing off the South. I want my friends there to votefor me,'' Simon added. ``I'm realistic about resources. I simplycannot do everything.''   On the Republican side, Kemp said he was outspent in the Tuesdaycontests in South Dakota and Minnesota, but that would not happenin the South. Senate GOP leader Bob Dole won both contests, withformer evangelist Pat Robertson coming in second. Vice PresidentGeorge Bush trailed.   ``We beat Bush in Minnesota. ... I was outspent 8-to-1 by Doleand probably 10-to-1 by Robertson. We're going to match themdollar-for-dollar in the South and in South Carolina,'' Kemp said.   Kemp's hopes have been badly shaken by Robertson's strongshowing in the early caucus states. And Robertson has said that hewill win the South Carolina primary on March 5, the door-opener tothe Super Tuesday primaries.   ``I think last night proved the race is wide open. That's all Ireally needed. I needed to break up the idea that this is aBush-Dole race. This is no longer a Bush-Dole race,'' Kemp added.   Kemp finished second in Michigan, third in New Hampshire andMinnesota and fourth in Iowa and South Dakota.   Among the Democrats, Simon said he has concluded that the SuperTuesday contests will continue the early pattern of confusingresults with no clear front-runner emerging _ leading to a brokeredconvention in Atlanta.   ``Super Tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture,''he said. ``Phase one of the selection process ends on March 8. ...But we do not have the resources for winning in the Super Tuesdaystates.''   ``Phase two of the selection process begins March 15. I shalluse phase two to deliver the message that we must become a nationwith leadership characterized by compassion and vision and commonsense. It is on to Atlanta with that message.''   He cited ``growing evidence that for the first time in recenthistory there will be no first-ballot winner at the Democraticconvention.''   Simon claimed he was in second place in the delegate count, butthe AP count places Simon in third place with 33 delegates, behindDukakis with 44.5 and Gephardt with 39. Simon aides said he isclaiming delegates out of Minnesota, even though the returnsallocating the delegates there will not be known until March 8.   Simon is on the ballot in all the Super Tuesday primaries, buthe said he will do little or no campaigning in those states _except for the nationally televised debates that are a majorfeature of the next two weeks.   Simon's best day so far was in Iowa on Feb. 8, where he finisheda very close second to Gephardt. He was third in New Hampshire andthen fourth in the Tuesday contests.</TEXT></DOC>
