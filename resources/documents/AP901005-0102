Some offices for legislators from the former Communist Partywere ready in what was once a kindergarten, located near theParliament building. Lawmakers from other parties were also movinginto new rooms.   But they were shocked at prices in Bonn, the parliamentary seatof united Germany. Asked how he found his hotel, Wolfgang Thierseof the Social Democratic Party said:``Very expensive. I have neverbefore in my life slept for 215 marks ($140) a night.''   ``You're not there long enough to get your money's worth,''Thierse said.   At the offices of the former Communist Party, now called theParty of Democratic Socialism, lawmaker Sabine Fache was busysetting up her office after attending Friday's Parliament session.   ``We had a good flight from Berlin. It was a Lufthansa flightlate last night. That was a first,'' Ms. Fache said, laughing.   The four World War II allies prohibited Lufthansa, the nationalairline, from flying between West Germany and Berlin because itsplanes would have had to fly over East German territory. Thatchanged with German unity.   Missing in Bonn from the 23 Democratic Socialist deputies wasformer East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow, on a visit to Japan.Virtually all of the other 144 Parliament members from the Eastmade the trip West to Bonn.   After being driven past Parliament buildings, the newcomers weresplit among several hotels in the city, Ms. Fache said.   ``Ours was a little hotel on the outskirts. We weren't too happybecause there was no restaurant open. We ended up going to a littlepizza place about 11 p.m.,'' Ms. Fache said.   Bonn, a sleepy city along the Rhine, is notorious for closingdown early, unlike the bustling metropolis of Berlin.   But Social Democratic Party delegates said they had expectedmore distance from some of Bonn's deputies, Ms. Fache said.   ``But it wasn't like that. They gave us tips on what to do, theywere friendly. We were surprised. Maybe they still see us asexotic,'' she said.   Ms. Fache is a Social Democratic Party candidate for the Dec. 2elections from Altenburg, 150 miles south of Berlin.   New parliamentarians from other parties, many of whom arrived onthe same Lufthansa flight, were also scattered among various Bonnhotels.   Most were eager to get down to business.   ``I really can't talk about my feelings,'' said former EastGerman Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere and now a member of theBonn Cabinet. ``I just want to get down to work.''   And he meant it - the soft-spoken politician was the firstmember to arrive for Friday morning's Cabinet meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
