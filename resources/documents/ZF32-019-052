AND DESIGNER FRAMESandM;Harvard Graphics for Windows ships this quarter.andP;  And if SoftwarePublishing's market leader in presentation graphics is stepping out in newclothes, can a fashionable display of its worthy rival Lotus' Freelance befar behind?andP;  The debut of Freelance for Windows is also scheduled for thisquarter.andP;  So much for the old forms-oriented interface of the DOS graphicsleaders.andM;These new Windows versions promise to be much more interactive and fund touse, even as they read and write to the file formats of their DOS-basedpredecessors.andP;  At this writing, Lotus was expected to announce a competitiveupgrade price to its Windows product.andP;  Software Publishing confined itsupgrade price to registered users of Harvard Graphics.andP;  Version 3.0 users canupgrade for $50.andP;  Users of earlier versions can upgrade for $125.andM;SPEAKING OF LOTUSandM;Though Lotus' 1-2-3 version 3.1andplus; still enjoys attention after its late-summershipping, the Windows version of the world-famous spreadsheet is sure tosteal center stage.andP;  The Windows version, like v3.1andplus;, is three-dimensionaland features Datalens.andP;  Datalens debuted last May when Lotus shipped 1-2-3v2.3.andP;  It allows users to import data from external databases, includingdBASE IV, Paradox, and SQL server.andP;  Both upgrades are covered by the Lotustechnology guarantee, which carries a $49.95 upgrade price for anyone whopurchased any version of 1-2-3 since March 1; it's $150 for all otherregistered users.andP;  Both products also feature a competitive upgrade price of$150 for users of Borland's Quattro and Microsoft's Excel.andM;Symantec and Central Point, two of the leaders in PC utilities, issuedlate-summer maintenance releases of their popular products, Norton Utilitiesand PC Tools.andP;  Registered users of Norton Utilities 6.0 should have therelease in their possession by now.andP;  Symantec planned to ship new disksdirectly to them.andP;  Registered users of Central Point's PC Tools 7.0 can alsoreceive free disks containing updated system files.andP;  If you haven't receivedyours, call Symantec at 1-800-441-7234 and Central Point at (505) 690-8088.andM;Central Point's other recent upgrade, MacTools Deluxe 1.2, which shipped thissummer, brought System 7 compatibility with balloon help and Rescue, Mirror,and Optimizer to that product.andP;  The upgraded version is only for Mac userswho plan to move to System 7.andP;  But those who do will appreciate theinexpensive list price: $14 plus $5 shipping.andP;  For information, call1-800-445-4208.andM;STOLEN MEMORYandM;Even as Symantec and Central Point went to work on their DOS 5.0-compatibleutilities.andP;  Quarterdeck was preparing a new version of its QEMM memorymanager.andP;  QEMM 386 already delivered more muscular memory management thatwhat could be had from DOS 5.0.andP;  Yet Quarterdeck's own version 6.0 promisesto deliver as much as 115 K additional high memory by mapping PC ROM codeinto high RAM.andM;Just how much additional memory can be had from the new technology--whichQuarterdeck calls &quot;Stealth&quot;--depends on a manufacturer's ROM design.andP;  Not allof Stealth's tricks work with every manufacturer's implementations, butQEMM's Optimize feature will test Stealth's techniques on a user's andrecommend those that work.andP;  &quot;Squeeze,&quot; another new product feature, squeezeseven more usable memory by temporarily increasing the high RAM region forprograms that require more memory during initialization and then freeing thatmemory for other uses after they are resident.andP;  Version 6.0 also supports the&quot;Suspend-Resume&quot; feature of many laptops (allowing them to be powered up inthe same state they were in when they were shut off), as well as Chips andamp;Technologies' SCAT Shadow RAM.andM;THE RECORDS BUSINESSandM;PC-File, a dBASE-compatible flatfile database, appeared in version 6.0 thissummer.andP;  This is the latest release of the popular program, which startedlife in 1982 as a shareware product.andP;  Its maker, Buttonware, has gonecommercial since that time, and now PC-File, complete with manuals and helpfiles, distributes exclusively in the reseller channel.andP;  However, it remainsone of the best values in easy-to-use flatfile databases.andM;Registered users of any previous version can upgrade of PC-File 6.0 for$49.95; for new users, the prices ranges from $75 to $100.andP;  A LAN versionwith a site license for up to five users is also available and can be had inthe channel for between $249 and $299.andP;  Version 6.0 features a new andimproved interface with pull-down menus and full mouse support, a file Findfeature to locate files on any drive and directory, improved help screens, aplain-English macro facility and keystroke recorder, and a revamped reportwriter.andM;IBM, eying the ever-expanding international markets of small and mid-sizedbusinesses, as well as the needs of multinationals, released version 2.1 ofits Platinum Accounting Series.andP;  Despite its numeric designation, this is aconsiderable upgrade from version 2.0.andP;  In addition to adding a new module,the Foreign Currency Manager, nine other modules are being updated.andM;Carol Ellison is a freelance writer based in New York.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
