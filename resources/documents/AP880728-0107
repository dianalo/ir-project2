Chatichai Choonhavan, a conservative former army general andmillionaire, formally announced his nomination as prime ministerThursday.   Chatichai, 66, a member of Parliament and an acting deputy primeminister, reluctantly accepted the nomination Wednesday after PremTinsulanonda refused another term for unspecified personal reasons.Prem has served for eight years.   ``The five political parties that will form the coalitiongovernment have agreed to support the leader of the largest party,and as that party's leader, I am pleased to accept thenomination,'' Chatichai told reporters Thursday.   However, before he accepted the nomination to a four-year termas prime minister, Chatichai said on Wednesday: ``If I were primeminster, I'm afraid it (the government) won't last more than threemonths.''   Chatichai was nominated by the leaders of five political partiesthat hastily formed a coalition headed by Prem after no singleparty won a plurality in Sunday's parliamentary election.   Prem, a 67-year-old former army commander, called the elections24 months early after dissolving Parliament, disbanding hisfaction-ridden coalition government and nullifying a no-confidencemotion from the opposition.   Chatichai's Thai Nation Party received the most votes inSunday's general election. The other four parties in the coalitionare the Democrat Party, the Social Action Party, the RassadornParty and the United Democracy Party.   Although Chatichai's party and the coalition partners hold 215of the 357 seats in the lower house of Parliament, more lobbyingmay take place before his name is submitted for approval toconstitutional monarch Bhumibol Adulyadej.   In the past, Thailand's powerful military and senior bureaucratsalso were said to have been involved in the final choice of thecountry's leader.   Under Thai law, after elections the major parties select a primeministerial candidate, who does not have to be a member ofParliament. Prem, for instance, does not hold an elective office.   The coalition that backed Prem's last government, virtually thesame one that nominated Chatichai, was plagued by many divisions.   Before his nomination, Chatichai also was not widely regarded asa likely choice and has not enjoyed close ties with the powerfulmilitary, as Prem did.   However, Chatichai said Thursday he met with the army chief,Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, and ``got military support'' for hisnomination.   Chatichai's nomination was welcomed by students and othergovernment critics because he, unlike Prem, was an electedofficial. After the nomination the students said they would endprotests they held before the nomination.   ``Chatichai represents the people who voted him into thegovernment and we respect that,'' student leader Mana Treelayatewatsaid Thursday.   Mana, a leader of the 100,000-member Students Federation ofThailand, said: `This is the first time in 10 years that democracycan be developed and mature in Thailand. We have reached our goal:premiership from direct elections.''   Chatichai is a retired army major general and wealthybusinessman who has held the foreign affairs and industryportfolios in earlier governments.   Commissioned as an army officer in 1940, Chatichai served inThailand's brief war in Indochina in 1940-41, in World War II andin the Korean War to which Thailand sent troops to fight with theUnited Nations command. He also served as ambassador to Argentina,Austria, Turkey, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.   If Chatichai succeeds Prem, he is expected to follow aconservative, pro-Western policy and emphasize economic development.</TEXT></DOC>
