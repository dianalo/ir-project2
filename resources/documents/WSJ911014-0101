The lawsuit, moved last week to the Brooklyn courtroom ofU.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein, also should help clarifyrecent federal appeals court decisions on the responsibilityof companies in bankruptcy-law proceedings forgovernment-mandated cleanups.</LP><TEXT>   Forced in 1982 to seek bankruptcy-court protection as aresult of thousands of asbestos-related lawsuits, Manvilleemerged from bankruptcy court in 1988 with the asbestosclaimants holding majority control. As a result, any moneypaid to the government for environmental damage will depletethe value of the more-than-$1 billion asbestos settlement.Exposure to asbestos has been linked to lung disease andcancer.   Attorneys for Manville, which is based in Denver, areseeking a declaration by the court that the company isn'tresponsible for helping to pay for the cleanup of four wastesites, located in Florida, Maine, Colorado and California.The first three are old dumpsites said by the government tocontain waste generated by Johns-Manville Co., Manville'spredecessor, along with many other companies. Johns-Manvilleran an asbestos mill at the site in California on land leasedfrom Southern Pacific Land Co.   Manville argues that because the Environmental ProtectionAgency never filed a claim against it during bankruptcyproceedings, the EPA can't bring one now against thereorganized company. Robert Batson, Manville's seniorlitigation counsel, said that if Manville prevails regardingthese sites, it may seek similar declarations concerningother sites polluted before Johns-Manville filed forbankruptcy.   Manville earlier failed in court to compel the governmentto help pay for asbestos-related injuries at naval shipyards.&quot;Now, if they're able to come back and prevail on this issueon environmental claims, they win twice against the asbestosvictims,&quot; Mr. Batson said.   The government has asked that the lawsuit be dismissed onthe grounds that any ruling would be premature. Thegovernment hasn't yet formally sought money from Manville,although the EPA has indicated that Manville is likely to beasked to contribute. An assistant U.S. attorney handling thecase said the government had no further comment on the case.   Judge Weinstein is considering the issue one month after afederal appeals court in New York ruled in a case involvingLTV Corp. that at least some EPA claims arising from sitespolluted prior to a Chapter 11 filing must be filed inbankruptcy proceedings as creditors' claims, along with thoseof other creditors.   &quot;This is a second-generation lawsuit,&quot; said Martin Baker,an environmental partner in the New York law firm Stroock andamp;Stroock andamp; Lavan, who was involved in the appeals court case,known as In Re: Chateaugay. &quot;We know from Chateaugay thatsome environmental claims are discharged under bankruptcy,now the question is, which ones?&quot;   In the meantime, the EPA has become more active inmonitoring bankruptcy proceedings to make sure it gets itsenvironmental claims included among other creditors' claims.&quot;The whole thing with LTV is not very good for the EPA. Itseems to create a large loophole for the debtor,&quot; said AlanBakalian, a regional counsel in the Northwest for the agency.   There's also a concern among environmentalists that theChateaugay decision will allow companies facing largeenvironmental claims to escape them by filing forbankruptcy-court protection. The fact that one of theearliest cases to follow Chateaugay involves Johns-Manville,which used bankruptcy protection to handle massive personalinjury claims, doesn't reduce that concern.   But bankruptcy lawyers say that personal-injury suits andenvironmental cleanup demands, while both costly, presentdifferent strategic problems for companies.   &quot;The asbestos litigation was literally coming in at 1,000to 1,500 a month; you can't linger under the siege of thoselawsuits. That's why they had to go into Chapter 11,&quot; saidHerbert Edelman, a bankruptcy partner at Kaye, Scholer,Fierman, Hayes andamp; Handler who represents Manville. &quot;With theenvironment, government activity is very slow, verydifferent. It doesn't present the same kind of threat toongoing business as asbestos-type litigation.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
