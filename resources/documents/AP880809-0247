DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A young lawyer at the center of an insidertrading ring known as the ``Yuppie Five'' was sentenced Tuesday tofour months in prison _ nearly two years after he admitted hisguilt.   Michael David pleaded guilty in November 1986 to four criminalcounts for his part in an insider trading scheme with three otherWall Street professionals and an investor.   The five, who have all pleaded guilty to various charges, wereall in their 20s at the time of the indictment and were dubbed the``Yuppie Five.''   The case had nothing to do with insider trading cases involvingIvan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, said officials.   David, 30, of Manhattan, the last to plead guilty after hispre-trial motions were denied by U.S. District Judge John Keenan inlate 1986, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mailfraud and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange Commissioninvestigation.   ``You completely disrupt the forces of the free market and helpto create incredible cynicism among the general populace,'' Keenanlectured David, adding: ``People think that no one is straight.''   Defense lawyer Darrell Fennell, in asking for leniency, notedthat David, once an associate at the the prominent New York lawfirm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, facesdisbarment and has been driving a cab to support himself.   Visibly irritated, Keenan countered: ``I don't think anyoneshould confuse the practice of law with a right _ it's aprivilege!''   ``I regret my conduct,'' David, dressed in a dark gray suit,told Keenan before sentence was imposed and asked the judge for anopportunity ``to help rebuild my life as I have tried to do.''   ``If I just say `Go and sin no more,''' said Keenan, slappinghis own wrist, ``I'm making a mockery of the process.''   Keenan added: ``You did betray a trust.''   He sentenced David to four months in prison and four yearsprobation. Keenan did not impose a fine but David faces civilpenalties of between $50,000 and $150,000 under an SEC consentagreement.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Lowenson Jr., noted that Davidhad cooperated extensively for almost two years with federalinvestigators and if there were any future trials arrising from theprobe ``Mr. David would be an important government witness.''   Keenan said he would have sentenced David to more jail time ifnot for his cooperation.   David received the longest jail term of the ``Yuppie Five.''Former stock broker Morton Shapiro was sentenced to two months inprison but the other three did not receive jail terms.</TEXT></DOC>
