The incident is the latest instance of U.S. pressureholding Japanese supercomputers out of the U.S. Some Japanesecomplain the action is hypocritical considering the push theU.S. has made to force Japanese government laboratories tobuy American supercomputers.</LP><TEXT>   But U.S. government and industry officials say they areresisting what they see as a Japanese plan to enter theinternational supercomputer market by discounting, or evengiving away, the multimillion dollar machines.   &quot;It's a very difficult situation for us,&quot; said YoshinoriKinouchi, Fujitsu's public relations manager. &quot;We wanted todonate because it's a very good international contribution,but we do not want to make a donation with trouble.&quot;   Richard Antes, president of a Boulder, Colo., consortiumof universities doing atmospheric research, said the donationwould have gone to Model Evaluation Consortium for ClimateAssessment, or MECCA, to be used by scientists studying thegreenhouse effect. MECCA, based in Boulder, is funded byelectric utility organizations from France, Italy and Japanas well as the Electric Power Research Institute, a U.S.trade organization. MECCA is operated by Mr. Antes'sUniversity Consortium; Mr. Antes said it doesn't have anyU.S. government funding.   Although MECCA's 13 principal researchers currently leasetime on a supercomputer made by Cray Research Inc.,Minneapolis, they were eager for the $15 million Fujitsusupercomputer because it runs &quot;two-to-five times faster thanthe Cray&quot; model they're using, Mr. Antes said.   &quot;It's really a tragedy that they had to withdraw theoffer. This is a very badly needed resource for theclimate-modeling community,&quot; Mr. Antes said. He said theresearchers need supercomputers to dissect various models ofthe greenhouse effect, whose projections vary widely.   Mr. Antes declined to name government officials whoblocked the offer. &quot;The proposal ran into opposition fromCray Research and parts of the U.S. government,&quot; he said,leading MECCA and Fujitsu to drop the plan. Cray officialscouldn't be reached for comment.   Mr. Kinouchi of Fujitsu said that &quot;some congressmen&quot; wrotea letter complaining about the transaction, but he didn'tknow which congressman were involved.   A spokesman for U.S. Representative Richard Gephardt (D.,Mo.) said that Mr. Gephardt had sent letters to the Japaneseembassy and to President Bush's science adviser, AlanBromley, protesting the proposed donation.   Similar events occurred in 1987, when the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology said it cancelled plans to buy orrent a supercomputer made by Japan's NEC Corp. after U.S.Commerce Department pressure. The Commerce Department said itwarned M.I.T. that it would pursue &quot;dumping&quot; charges if NECtried to sell the computer below cost. And there have beenrumors that other U.S. laboratories were forced to squelchinterest in Japanese machines.   U.S. government and industry have grown increasinglyworried about Japan's advances in supercomputing, aided inpart by the Japanese companies' willingness to offer themachines cheaply -- or even for free -- at home and abroad.Some independent tests show that NEC and Fujitsusupercomputers can now crunch numbers as fast as Craymachines. Cray was stunned when NEC earlier this year won itsfirst major North American sale, beating out Cray for aCanadian weather forecasting contract.</TEXT></DOC>
