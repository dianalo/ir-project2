The bride was nursing at her mother's breast. The bleary-eyedgroom, burdened with a huge turban, a sword and marigold garlands,was yawning.   Sonu, the 2-year-old bride, and Arjun, the 8-year-old groom,were among an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 children who were marriedacross India's Rajasthan state during the weekend in violation of alaw banning child marriage.   The marriages are held on the first and second days of the fullmoon cycle in the month of May when village elders, in keeping witha centuries-old tradition, study the stars and predict rain _ thesource of life in a state where 80 percent of the land is desert.   These auspicious days also are celebrated as a weekend harvestfestival for the year's first maize and lentil crops.   Such weddings normally are kept secret from outsiders, lest theparents be prosecuted for marrying their children so young. Ifconvicted, an offender can be jailed for three months, fined about$330 or both.   But there is no record of a single conviction in Rajasthan,which lies between New Delhi and Bombay. Local journalists andNaryan Lal Tak, a tourist guide who is writing a book on Rajasthanweddings, said they knew of only two cases in which complaints werefiled, but no one was charged.   ``I have nothing to fear. I am just following what myforefathers did,'' said Sonu's father, Narayan Prajapati. His fourother children, none older than 14, also are married.   ``I was married when I was just six years old and my wife onlyone year old,'' said Prajapati.   ``For me, it is but natural that my children should get marriedaccording to our tradition,'' said Prajapati, who earns $4 a dayworking as a carpenter in Vorawas, 19 miles east of the ancientcity of Jodhpur where India's famed Rajput, or warrior, clanthwarted the might of 16th century Mogul invaders.   A 1978 Indian law set the legal marriage age at 18 for women and21 for men, but enforcement has been limited _ especially inRajasthan, where Hindu traditions are deeply rooted. Many of thechild marriages take place in areas where there are few lawenforcement officers and where disruption of custom could triggerviolence.   In and around Vorawas, 17 other marriages were conducted inrecent days. None of the brides was older than 14.   ``I am getting four of my daughters married,'' said Udham Singh,the head of the neighboring village of Gujrabas.   The youngest of his four daughters was 3-year-old Jamuna, whowas playing hopscotch with older children in the courtyard of thefamily's mud-plastered house.   ``If you travel through Rajasthan today you will find (child)marriages being held everywhere,'' said Tak, the tourist guide.   ``By conservative estimate at least 40,000 to 50,000 marriagesare solemnized in the state during these days,'' he added.   ``The parents of the bride think that they are doing what theyshould do,'' Tak said. ``They do not understand, or do not care tounderstand, all the nice legal things.''   ``They believe that they are doing the right thing and amarriage should be a grand marriage,'' he said.   That was apparent at Vorawas.   As Sonu and Arjun fought sleep amid heat from the sacred fireand loud songs of the village women, the elders held their ownrite: the opium ceremony.   The oldest man made a watery paste of opium, which he offered toall.   ``You are required to drink it from his hand and then bless thenewly wedded couple,'' said a member of the group. ``When he offersyou the opium, he is the giver. In return you can give yourblessings.''   But the blessings must accompany some money, another manadvised. ``Just 51 rupees (about $3.30),'' he whispered.   The groom is required to take an oath in front of a fire thatpersonifies the fire god, Agni Devta. Then the bride and the groomwalk seven times around the flames.   Hindus believe the fire god is the most powerful after the holytrinity of Shiva the destroyer, Vishnu the protector and Brahma thecreator.   ``If either of them budge from the vow of being man and wife heor she will face the anger of the fire god,'' said Ratan Lal, awedding guest.   ``For you this may appear terrible, but for us it is natural,''Tak said. ``In villages we wonder why you marry at old age in thecities.''</TEXT></DOC>
