For Boeing, the order not only boosts its once-lagging 757 production, it also gives the Seattle aerospace giant a record order backlog. The big 757 order also effectively closes the door on Boeing's development of the advanced-technology 7J7 plane.    The transaction had been expected. American estimated its investment for the first 50 planes would be more than $2 billion, which would double if the options are exercised.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boeing closed at $53.625 a share, down 25 cents. The stock rose earlier this week on speculation about the order. Meanwhile, shares of Dallas-based AMR Corp., American's parent, rose 37.5 cents to close at $40.375 each, also on the Big Board.    The 757s will allow American to begin retiring its older 727s and to phase out the 737s it received last year when it acquired AirCal Inc. American will use its McDonnell Douglas Corp. Super 80s on 737 routes; the new 757s will supplant the Super 80s and 727s on routes with high load factors. Load factor refers to the percentage of available seats that are occupied.    Robert L. Crandall, AMR's chairman and president, said at a news conference in New York that to power the new planes, American chose Rolls-Royce PLC's RB211535E4 engine, which he called quiet and fuel efficient.    Mr. Crandall said the airline's financial position is strong, allowing it to make the purchase with internally generated funds plus debt or lease financing. Neither Boeing nor Rolls-Royce, based in London, will assist with the financing, he added.    American will take delivery on nine of the planes in 1989, 20 in 1990 and 21 in 1991. As the airline retires older planes, its total fleet in 1991 isn't expected to grow from the current projection of about 580 planes. At the end of 1988, the average age of the carrier's current 418 planes will be 9.4 years; the new planes will reduce this to 8.9 years in 1991.    American sees several advantages to the 757s.    The 757 carries 194 passengers, compared with American's 727s, which hold 118. The twin-engine 757s require two people in the cockpit; the 727, which has three engines, requires three crew members. And, the carrier said, the 757 burns an average of 25% less fuel per seat mile than the Super 80.    In addition, many parts can be interchanged between the 757 and 767. The new planes also can be used at airports with noise limits, and the larger capacity is an advantage at airports with restrictions aimed at easing congestion, American said. It cited Washington National as an example of both. Furthermore, pilots who fly American's large fleet of 767s will be certified to fly the new 757s as well.    With the sale to American, Boeing's order total so far this year is $13.7 billion, against $8.35 billion at this time last year. In number of aircraft, orders have reached 326 this year, compared with 154 last year. For all of 1987, Boeing took orders for 366 airliners valued at $19.89 billion.    American's order will cause Boeing to boost the monthly output rate on the 757s to five from the current four, said Dean Thornton, president of Boeing's commercial airplane division. But Boeing won't be hiring additional employees to accommodate the stepped-up production, he added.    &quot;We're on a roll. We're going great,&quot; Mr. Thornton said.    Boeing's shares have surged since International Lease Finance Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., disclosed May 2 that it was considering placing a huge jet order. The order turned out to have a value of $4.6 billion for Boeing. Other big orders are expected. However, Mr. Thornton declined to comment on industry speculation that Allegis Corp., the Chicago parent of United Airlines, also is negotiating a big 757 order.    Boeing suspended work on the 7J7 last year. American was the only U.S. airline that had expressed serious interest in a 165-seat version of the proposed planes.    Yesterday, Mr. Thornton said Boeing has begun a &quot;total rethinking&quot; of the 7J7 concept. Boeing has even stopped using the plane's name, referring to it in recent materials as a &quot;new medium-sized jet transport.&quot;    A Boeing spokesman said a consortium of Japanese companies that had a 25% equity interest in the 7J7 project would be involved in developing the medium-sized jet transport. Those companies include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Fuji Heavy Industies Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.    Earlier this week, a Boeing executive told a gathering of the Japan-America Society in Seattle that the Japanese companies also have held talks with Boeing's aircraft-building rival, the Airbus Industrie four-nation consortium based in Toulouse, France. The executive said he understood the talks were very preliminary. </TEXT></DOC>
