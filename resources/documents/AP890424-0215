Founded in 1912, the ANC has the reputation of being the world'soldest liberation movement. But it says it is stronger and moreeffective than ever, although its imprisoned leader, NelsonMandela, recently acknowledged that ``the realization of ourfondest dreams may not be at hand.''   ANC officials live modestly but in relative comfort in Lusaka,and work in a weatherbeaten one-story building in the alley justoff the main downtown throughfare.   No special security is evident at the headquarters, no sign ofguns or military uniforms. The cramped offices, with cluttereddesks and bulging file cabinets, resemble the offices of autorepair shops that share the same neighborhood.   The atmosphere is relaxed and the dress casual and the officialswho sometimes wear jackets and ties look slightly out of place.   Tom Sebina, the spokesman, said no more than 1,000 ANC membersare based in Lusaka. The organization refuses to divulge itsmembership, but it is estimated at 14,000, including about 8,000 inits military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, which means spear of thenation.   The ANC managed a steady stream of political successesthroughout the 1980s, but it currently faces several majorchallenges that have left it in a somewhat defensive position.   The international pressure on the South African government haseased since it signed a peace treaty with Angola and Cuba andagreed to grant independence to Namibia. As part of the treaty,Angola agreed to shut down ANC training camps, leaving theguerrillas with no acknowledged military bases in southern Africa.   The Soviet Union, which is the ANC's main arms supplier, hassaid that black revolution appears unlikely now and that anegotiated settlement should be sought.   ``The South Africans have scored diplomatic victories, but thesewill be only temporary advances,'' said James Stuart, a member ofthe ANC's National Executive Committee, its policy-making arm.``There have been no fundamental changes to apartheid, and this isthe issue they cannot evade.''   ANC President Oliver Tambo visited Moscow earlier this year, andthe organization has denied widespread reports that it is underpressure to call off its guerrilla attacks.   ``The Soviets accept the direction we have chosen and there isno change in their level of support,'' said Sindiso Mfenyane,another member of the National Executive Committee.   But in many eyes, the ANC has lost the initiative in itsstruggle against South Africa's white-led government.   After 28 years of limited guerrilla warfare, the ANC still vowsto intensify its armed struggle. But the military threat is limited.   ``The main benefit to the ANC of the armed struggle is thatexploding bombs and shootouts with the security forces keep itsprofile high in the black townships,'' said the South Africanpolitical analyst Stanley Uys. But he maintains that the impact onwhite civilians is marginal since they are seldom targets orvictims.   South African police say the number of ANC attacks has risensteadily and topped 200 last year, but its bombing and sabotagecampaign has been largely inactive of late.   ANC leaders deny the organization is in retreat, but many havespent more than a quarter-century in exile and hold out little hopeof making an imminent return to South Africa as triumphantrevolutionary heros.   ``We know that change won't come overnight in South Africa andthat some of us may not be around when it happens,'' said Mfenyane,who has spent 27 of his 49 years in exile. ``But we know that thechange will come.''   The ANC's endurance, more so than its limited successes, is oneof the main reasons it still has the loyalty of many of SouthAfrica's 28 million blacks.   The organization bridges both generational gaps and tribaldifferences. Elderly black men will speak of the reserved dignityof Tambo, a lawyer, while militant youths are drawn to theorganization's commitment to violent revolution.   Almost all leading anti-apartheid groups in South Africa vowallegiance to the organization and it is widely believed the ANCwould win national elections if blacks were allowed to vote.   But the ANC's support is far from universal. Recent polls,including one this year by The Independent newspaper of London,indicate that there is no black consensus on the ANC's violence orits campaign for comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.   The ANC also has had differences with allied anti-apartheidorganizations in South Africa.   The internal anti-apartheid movement harshly denounced Mandela'swife, Winnie, earlier this year and accused her controversialbodyguards of terrorizing other blacks. But the ANC, at a Marchmeeting in Norway, said, ``Winnie should be given the opportunityto continue to be the symbol of our struggle.''   The ANC, based abroad since it was banned in 1960, bristles attalk that it has lost touch with black South Africans after so manyyears in exile.   ``There is more contact now than ever before because of thecontinuous flow of traffic from South Africa,'' said Sebina. ``Wecouldn't have survived this long if the people didn't support us.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs May 1</NOTE></DOC>
