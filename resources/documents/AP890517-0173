(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A minister who operates a children's homewas sentenced to a year in prison Wednesday for striking a statetrooper during a raid prompted by allegations of abuse.   Circuit Judge Clinton Lockard also placed the Rev. HermanFountain, 39, on four years' probation but allowed him to remainfree on $40,000 bail pending an appeal.   A jury Tuesday deliberated for less than an hour beforeconvicting Fountain of assault on an officer.   Highway Patrol Capt. Richard Smith testified that whenauthorities took children from the home to the courthouse June 13,Fountain charged at him, hit him and kicked him.   Fountain testified that he did not intend to hit Smith, but mayhave done so as he rushed to the courthouse basement to see whatwas happening to the children.   ``I acted like any momma or daddy when they hear their childscreaming,'' Fountain said. ``They (officers) were pushing mearound like a dog. The whole thing was a farce.''   Some parents who have entrusted troubled children to Fountain'scare at the independent Baptist church-based Bethel Children's Homesay he has been unfairly targeted by the state Department of PublicWelfare.   The agency last year took custody of 72 youngsters in aninvestigation of beatings and other abuse at the home. The courtgave the state custody of 17 children found to have been abused;the rest were returned to their parents or guardians.   Under state law, church-run homes are exempt from stateregulation, and Bethel has taken in more children.</TEXT></DOC>
