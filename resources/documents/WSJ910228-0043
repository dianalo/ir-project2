The Bush administration has strongly supported the Patriotproduction compact with Italy, but the overlapping corporateconnections illustrate the often tangled interests in theworld of international arms.</LP><TEXT>   Few weapons in the war with Iraq have won more fame thanthe Patriot air defense system, which was celebrated byPresident Bush in a Feb. 15 visit to Raytheon Corp.'sfacilities in Massachusetts. By comparison, theItalian-designed mines, sold to Baghdad during the Iran-Iraqwar, remain a hazard for allied troops today and are anexample of the international arms trafficking by Westerncompanies that helped build Iraq's arsenal.   Linking the varied Italian interests is the giant FiatS.p.A., in which Libya was a large investor from 1976 to1986. Fiat holds a 50% interest in the arms company, ValsellaMeccanotecnica S.p.A., even as a Fiat subsidiary, BPD, isseparately a partner in the Italian-Patriot consortium.   Seven Valsella employees were sentenced this month inItaly in connection with the sales to Iraq, which includedalmost nine million mines shipped in the early 1980s,according to the prosecution. The sentences, which ran aslong as 22 months in prison, were suspended, and the companyargues that any export violations were largely technical. Butindustry sources say the munitions, valued at nearly $180million, included four different types of mines, many of themequipped with anti-shock devices to frustrate mine-clearingmethods such as fuel-air explosions.   Fiat denies any role in the management of Valsella, butits interests are represented by two directors who sit on afourmember board for the holding company, MeccanotecnicaS.p.A. A recent article in the weekly L'Espresso quotes oraltestimony to an Italian prosecutor by an officer in Fiat'sfinance directorate indicating Fiat knew about the sales andsought to assist Valsella with Iraqi officials when thecompany ran into hitches.   A Fiat spokesman said he couldn't deny anything in thearticle, but added that &quot;notwithstanding having executives onthe board, we were not directly involved in the management.&quot;Operations are said to lie with the Borletti family, whichshares ownership with Fiat and is represented by GiovanniBorletti, a chief executive in the company and the son of theindustrialist, Ferdinando Borletti, who once sat on the Fiatboard.   &quot;Everybody was selling to Iraq,&quot; said the younger Mr.Borletti in a telephone interview. He said Valsella hasenjoyed good relations with not only the Italian but U.S.military and said information had been provided to the alliesregarding the munitions. &quot;Nobody was expecting this,&quot; he saidof the current war. Instead of land mines, he said, Valsellais focusing more of its efforts toward casting parts forcars.   By comparison, the international market for the Patriothas been enhanced by its high-profile performance againstIraq's crude Scud missiles. Under the compact with Italy, theU.S. would put up $500 million to pay Raytheon for the mostsophisticated radar and control equipment, while the Italianconsortium of which BPD is part would be licensed toco-produce Patriot launchers and 1280 missiles.   ---   Guy Collins in Milan contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
