(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Jim Bakker says he has alwayspaid his taxes, but the federal government contends otherwise.   Bakker and his wife, Tammy, received a $1.2 million tax billThursday from the Internal Revenue Service. The lien ordered theBakkers to pay $666,000 for 1981 and $565,000 for 1982 in taxes,interest and penalties, The Orlando Sentinel reported in today'seditions.   ``I don't owe taxes,'' Bakker said when shown a copy of thelien. ``I've always paid my taxes. It's a part of the plot todestroy Jim and Tammy.''   The tax lien is only the latest in a series of setbacks for thetelevangelists, who recently moved to Orlando.   Bakker is to stand trial in August on charges of fraud inconnection with his former Praise the Lord ministry. Bakker, hiswife and an aide also have been ordered to pay $7.6 million to PTLas part of a judgment in a suit that accused them of misusingministry funds.   The lien, filed in Orange County, prevents the Bakkers fromselling any property without IRS permission, said Jackie Bracey, anIRS public affairs officer in Greensboro, N.C.   The Bakkers have been taping their ``Jim and Tammy'' show at anOrlando shopping center since May 8. They are leasing space at thecenter and renting a home in an exclusive subdivision.   During a taping Wednesday, Bakker told his audience he and hiswife were about $200,000 behind in paying off bills related to theshow.   IRS officials said the lien was related only to the Bakkers'individual income for the two years. However, Tammy Bakkercontended the IRS is somehow trying to charge the Bakkers for otherexpenses.   ``They're charging us for PTL store fixtures,'' she said,referring to the North Carolina ministry they were pressed to leavein 1987 amid sex and financial scandals.   In Columbia, S.C., U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishopentertained a claim that his predecessor, Judge Rufus Reynolds, wasbiased in ordering the $6.6 million judgment against the Bakkersand their top aide.   Bishop ordered a hearing on the matter and ruled that theremnants of the now-defunct PTL television ministry can filejudgments in states where it believes the Bakkers and former topaide David Taggart have money or property.   Taggart was ordered to pay PTL an additional $1 million.   The Bakkers and Taggart are believed to own property or havemoney in North Carolina, California, Florida, Missouri and NewYork. Any such property then could be seized by U.S. marshals.   In January, Reynolds retired and granted a newspaper interviewin which he called Bakker a ``little sawed-off runt.'' Bakker'sattorneys used that article Thursday as evidence of their claimthat the former judge was biased and prejudiced against the Bakkers.</TEXT></DOC>
