Analysts expect further weakening if, as they predict, the economy continues to slow down.    In the quarter ended June 30, after-tax earnings on continuing operations of 643 major corporations rose 5% from the 1988 second quarter. Net income climbed 4%, compared with 10% in the first quarter and 20% in the fourth quarter of 1988.    Reported profits were boosted by a pair of misleading factors, as they had been in the first quarter. Price increases raised inventory profits, but these are to some extent illusory, as the inventory usually will have to be replaced at higher cost. The 1986 Tax Reform Act, moreover, continues to limit the amounts that companies can charge against earnings. As Christopher Caton, a McGraw-Hill/DRI economist, says, this increases reported profits and leads to higher federal taxes.    Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers, looks for a sustained decline in corporate cash flow-after-tax profits plus depreciation allowances. &quot;By Labor Day,&quot; he says, &quot;cash flow will be at its lowest level since late 1986. This shrinkage threatens the growth of business investment, one of the few demand sectors still showing sustained vitality.&quot;    Consumer-oriented companies are usually expected to out-perform other corporations in a slowdown or a recession, but that may not be the case this year. Economists at Merrill Lynch note that wholesale prices have risen about two percentage points more than retail prices in the past year. &quot;As a result,&quot; they say, &quot;retail margins are being squeezed.&quot;    Among major groups, auto companies' second-quarter profits sagged and oil-industry results were overshadowed by Exxon's $850 million charge resulting from the Valdez oil spill in March. Computer concerns and steelmakers reported lower second-quarter net income, while the aerospace sector posted mixed results.    The auto slump took its toll on Big Three earnings, but the worst is yet to come. General Motors' net income dropped 3% and Ford posted a 15% decline. Chrysler, which reported weak earnings a year earlier, had a 7% rise this year, but a top company executive painted a troublesome profit picture for the rest of the year. &quot;I can't give you any assurance of continuing year-over-year {earnings} gains,&quot; said R.S. Miller Jr., executive vice president and chief financial officer.    What's causing the slump to bite hard into Big Three earnings is the increase in Japanese auto production in the U.S. The Big Three will build 18% fewer cars in the fourth quarter than a year earlier, forecasts Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade journal. Meanwhile, Japanese car production in the U.S. will jump 41%.    Exxon's charge to cover its estimated out-of-pocket costs for cleaning the Alaskan shoreline and waters wiped out most of the company's quarterly net income, reducing it to the lowest profit for any quarter in 20 years. Aside from the spill, Exxon's operations, like those of most major integrated companies, were strong. Higher crude prices boosted production profits. Gasoline-refining margins and petrochemical prices continued strong. Toward the end of the period, however, and through July, the fundamentals worsened as crude prices fell and gasoline and chemical margins narrowed sharply. Mobil had a $140 million charge related to the sale of operations in South Africa. Chevron net fell mostly because of $148 million of special gains a year earlier. Texaco and Amoco also had special year-earlier gains.    Most computer companies had a rough quarter; Wang, for instance, posted a $374.7 million loss, including restructuring and tax charges. Poor demand in the U.S. and the stronger dollar hurt the industry. In addition, mainframe companies got into a price war, and demand for minicomputers remained weak.    Supercomputer makers had an especially tough time, as Cray found demand soft and Control Data took a special charge to get out of the business. But IBM posted an earnings gain of 39%; the rise was just 8% after adjusting the year-earlier results for a restructuring charge and a gain on a sale. IBM had its first significant revenue gain in the U.S. in years, and got a strong performance from its AS/400 minicomputer line -- which wasn't yet introduced a year earlier. The industry's situation should change little this quarter.    A wide-ranging performance by aerospace and defense companies reflected a boom in airliner orders and the poor state of military contracting.    &quot;The defense-business environment is very tough,&quot; said Jerry Cantwell, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. &quot;And on the commercial side, it's almost totally the opposite.&quot; General Dynamics, one of several companies hit during the quarter by overruns on fixed-price Pentagon pacts, took an after-tax charge of $50 million to reflect excess costs on an attack submarine program. Lockheed's drop in profit was triggered by write-downs for overruns on two programs and the near phase-out of a third. McDonnell Douglas attributed its stunning deficit to a variety of factors, including a $72 million write-down to reflect overruns on its C-17 cargo plane. Northrop was hurt by a $150 million special provision stemming from additional costs incurred to complete a classified project.    Analysts' forecasts continue to be grim for the defense side and even more robust for the commercial. Mr. Cantwell said that for military contractors, &quot;there is no relief in sight.&quot; He added, &quot;The only way it will get easier is if the industry can cut costs even further.&quot; But in the jetliner arena, several Boeing and McDonnell Douglas programs now strained by manufacturing inefficiencies should begin to work better by the end of the year.    Hurt by slowing demand, higher raw-material costs and only moderate price gains, steelmakers posted lower profits. In the year-earlier period, producers benefited from higher prices, inventory buildup and relatively low raw-material costs. Still, steelmakers in the latest quarter generated higher profits per ton of steel shipped than in the first quarter. That reflected the tapering off of certain cost increases and the buildup of inventory by some customers. Steel's outlook is weak for the typically sluggish third quarter.    Some steelmakers fared better than others. Armco benefited from extraordinary gains, in large part from a joint venture. Allegheny Ludlum continued to see robust demand for its specialty-steel market, while Worthington Industries' processed steel benefited from strong demand for pressure cylinders, as well as promising results for new retail-oriented products. Profit at Inland Industries fell as it lost orders when contract talks stalled and as service-center volume declined. Bethlehem Steel had a special $50 million charge.    Here are the second-quarter profits for various industry groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When individual companies report for three-month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are used. In all the tables, 000s are omitted.    ---   BASIC MATERIALS @ 2ND QTR. 1989 2ND QTR. 1988 % CHG. @ 5,536,755 5,183,032 + 7    While steelmakers posted lower earnings, some aluminum companies enjoyed another quarter of robust profits despite sluggish consumer durables and construction markets. They were aided by strong demand in aerospace and can-sheet markets. Aluminum Co. of America was again bolstered by its overseas alumina operations. Amax, though posting a 45% drop in net because of a year-earlier gain of $125 million, turned in a strong operating performance led by aluminum.    Copper companies generally reported strong earnings growth, as prices increased. Some companies with coal interests said stoppages at mines in sympathy with a United Mine Workers strike at Pittston hurt earnings. Looking to the third quarter, Peter Anker, analyst at First Boston, thinks copper companies &quot;are going to do reasonably well.&quot; Gold companies were hurt as prices declined substantially from a year earlier. Although Homestake Mining posted an earnings increase, profit from continuing operations declined 67%.    Forest-products concerns showed modest improvement in the second quarter, boosted by increased wood prices. Georgia-Pacific's profit jumped 46%, partly because of increased capacity and an acquisition. Weyerhaeuser's profit was helped by strong paper and pulp markets but hurt by newsprint discounting. Demand for forest products was high in the Western U.S. and overseas, Weyerhaeuser said. Champion International, posting a 1% rise in profit, was hampered by restarting certain operations and softening newsprint prices. Louisiana-Pacific's 23% gain was helped by increased prices for building products. The company expects continuing price increases this quarter. Boise Cascade's strong results in its building-products segment offset weakness in its paper-products business.    In the paper industry, Kimberly-Clark was hurt by newsprint discounting, increased fiber costs and a maintenance shutdown at a pulp mill. International Paper was helped by acquisitions, increasing pulp prices and strong demand for paperboard and packaging. Mead's net fell because of restructuring; the company expects demand to be flat or slightly higher for the rest of the year.    The chemical industry is finding it harder to post record earnings quarter after quarter, though results vary widely. The second period saw declining profits at some big producers of commodity chemicals. Rising raw-material costs and lower selling prices are slimming the swollen margins of recent years. At Quantum, a producer of polyethylene and polypropylene, profit from continuing operations skidded 42%; the company had a nonrecurring gain of $129.4 million.

And although the major oil companies say they don't plan to increase their exploration spending in the U.S. soon, several large service companies have managed to become profitable through consolidations and restructurings. Contract-drilling companies have cut their losses, but there remains a large oversupply of rigs.    Natural-gas-pipeline companies again reported a wide spectrum of results, littered with special gains and charges. Enron, which operates the nation's largest natural-gas-pipeline system, said its net fell because of special year-earlier gains. It registered an increase in pipeline results. About $33.9 million of Sonat's net came from settling a rate case.    Continuing labor unrest hurt coal-company earnings, and the third-quarter outlook is clouded by lingering effects of lost shipments. Work stoppages, staged in support of the United Mine Workers' four-month strike against Pittston, shut down most union mines during much of June and July. Millions of tons of coal shipments were missed by major producers. @ OIL @ -- INTEGRATED OILS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 9 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Amoco Corp 497,000 667,000 - 25 @ Atlantic Richfield 467,000 400,000 + 17 @ Chevron Corp 404,000 520,000 - 22 @ Exxon Corp 160,000 1,200,000 - 87 @ Mobil Corp 401,000 519,000 - 23 @ Phillips Petroleum 197,000 170,000 + 16 @ Sun Co 105,000 -201,000 ... @ Texaco Inc 366,000 464,000 - 21 @ Unocal Corp 120,000 64,000 + 88 @ TOTAL 2,717,000 3,803,000 - 29 @ -- SECONDARY OILS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 14 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Amerada Hess 133,459 -23,460 ... @ Anadarko Petroleum 5,200 - 2,400 ... @ Ashland Oil 43,510 56,931 - 24 @ Kerr-McGee Corp 34,704 35,876 - 3 @ Louisiana Land 5,500 -17,200 ... @ MAPCO Inc 28,361 29,243 - 3 @ Murphy Oil Corp 16,763 9,400 + 78 @ Noble Affiliates 12,276 3,017 + 307 @ Occidental Petrol 80,000 77,000 + 4 @ Oryx Energy 17,000 -273,000 ... @ Pennzoil 118,045 1,388,701 - 91 @ Quaker State Corp 7,206 2,021 + 257 @ Union Texas Petro 85,900 28,800 + 198 @ USX Corp 250,000 213,000 + 17 @ TOTAL 837,924 1,527,929 - 45 @ -- DRILLERS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 4 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Energy Service 426 -1,077 ... @ Helmerich andamp; Payne 5,797 5,345 + 8 @ Parker Drilling -5,114 -16,690 ... @ Rowan Cos -4,607 -16,275 ... @ TOTAL -3,498 -28,697 ... @ -- OILFIELD EQUIP/SVCS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 4 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Baker Hughes 16,713 13,498 + 24 @ Dresser Indust 36,700 24,500 + 50 @ Halliburton Co 31,400 24,700 + 27 @ Schlumberger Ltd 126,824 144,035 - 12 @ TOTAL 211,637 206,733 + 2 @ OTHERS @ -- PIPELINES @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 7 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Burlington Resources 306,200 -98,953 ... @ Coastal Corp 35,300 30,600 + 15 @ Enron Corp 10,200 31,200 - 67 @ Enserch Corp 4,449 852 + 422 @ Panhandle Eastern -4,049 -1,223 ... @ Sonat Inc 43,801 21,577 + 103 @ Williams Cos -5,900 -2,200 ... @ TOTAL 390,001 -18,147 ... @ -- COAL @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 4 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ NACCO Industries 13,365 16,325 - 18 @ Penn Virginia Corp 1,923 7,810 - 75 @ Pittston Co 4,485 13,734 - 67 @ Westmoreland Coal -805 1,012 ... @ TOTAL 18,968 38,881 - 51    ---   INDUSTRIAL @ 2ND QTR. 1989 2ND QTR. 1988 % CHG. @ 3,972,681 3,495,518 + 14    The rail group's earnings soared, with comparisons being helped by a year-earlier net restructuring charge of $492 million at CSX and a $98.9 million loss from discontinued operations at Burlington Northern. But operating earnings generally fell because of an industrywide 1% decline in carloadings. Reduced results from transportation and real-estate operations at Santa Fe Pacific were only somewhat offset by improved performance of its natural-resources group. Santa Fe's year-earlier results were inflated by profit from discontinued operations. Norfolk Southern and CSX both benefited from strong export coal business, but the outlook is clouded by the Pittston strike.    The trucking group's earnings rose slightly, as the major less-than-truckload carriers gained market share from marginal competitors. But Consolidated Freightways' earnings declined because of expenses from its recent acquisition of Emery Air Freight. Analysts predict rate discounting will cut third-quarter net.    Shipment volume for air-freight couriers rose, but the sector's earnings fell because of declines at Federal Express.    Marine-transportation companies were hurt by lower-than-expected cargo volumes, with American President citing increased costs related to expansion.    Transportation-equipment producers reported higher profits, despite some slowing late in the quarter in the previously extremely strong sales of heavy trucks. Eaton reported slightly lower operating profit but net rose because of a special item in 1988.    Factory-machinery profits in the second quarter were lowered by production problems at Cincinnati Milacron, which is restructuring its machine-tool operations. Those problems are expected to affect third-period profit.    Profits of heavy-construction and farm-machinery producers jumped, mainly because of a 51% rise at Deere. The worst of the farm recession and drought appear to be over, and farmers are buying more tractors. Farmers still aren't splurging, but Deere has whacked costs enough to be highly profitable at current volume levels. Caterpillar reported a 3% profit decline despite a 17% sales surge; Steven J. Colbert of Prudential-Bache forecasts an about 20% drop in Caterpillar's second-half profit.    Electronic-component makers had a checkered performance, with giant Westinghouse reporting a 6% profit rise and AMP a 22% decline. More than half of AMP's drop came from special charges.    The slump in housing starts lingered through May, and the rebound in June wasn't enough to prevent a drop in earnings at some building-materials companies. Although most are operating at higher plant utilization than a year ago, analysts are cautious. The reason: June's 7% rise in housing starts is credited to sharply lower interest rates, and the outlook for rates is uncertain.    Net fell at some makers of containers and packaging, largely because of unsuccessful attempts to raise prices for containerboard and other products. Results were also hurt by unexpected price weakness in the newsprint market and by increases in the cost of wood at some mills. Federal Paper's profit soared, boosted by productivity gains and cost savings at a mill in Augusta, Ga.    Profits at heavy-construction companies rose slightly overall -- in line with analysts' expectations. Some analysts expect the segment's profit will be roughly flat in the second half.    For industrial and commercial services, profits generally rose as customers sought temporary workers and certain services in lieu of adding full-time workers to their staffs.    Profits also generally advanced for diversified industrial companies, boosted by stronger pricing. Earnings were helped by lower tax rates and by engineering and construction contracts for roads and environmental contracts sparked by regulatory requirements.

Sales surged, buoyed by declining mortgage-interest rates this spring and slight improvements in formerly moribund regional economies. Once again, sales were strongest in the West, paced by California.    Analysts expect retailers to report mixed results for the fiscal second quarter, which ended in July for most of them. Apparel chains will do better than most general merchants. Limited's net, for example, is expected to double. Sears Roebuck reported a 21% increase for the second calendar quarter; but profit at the company's merchandise group rose only 2.5% after a one-time gain and a change in the way Sears calculates adjustments for the effects of inflation on its inventories. K mart, meanwhile, is expected to post a 5% decline. Although K mart's sales improved in July from their sluggish pace earlier in the quarter, Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley said the chain is operating on a lower profit margin because it cut prices on a number of items earlier this year. Dayton Hudson and Wal-Mart are expected to report strong gains. Earnings are also likely to rise at May, Penney, Woolworth and Nordstrom.    Most apparel companies continued to benefit from better retail sales of their goods and from more-conservative manufacturing positions. Interco posted a loss on weaker footwear sales and higher interest charges. Hartmarx cited a sluggish performance at its specialty stores and higher interest expense.    Lodging and casino companies reported uneven results. Hotel units generally reported operating gains, while many casino operators posted moderate increases in operating earnings following a weak first quarter. Marriott's net income rose 5% despite higher interest costs from its share buy-back program, reflecting gains in its lodging, contract-services and restaurant units. Holiday Corp. reported improved operating income from both hotels and casinos, despite a sharp drop in net from the year-earlier quarter, which included a $154 million special gain.    Results for recreational-products companies were mixed. Most entertainment companies reported healthy gains while demand for boats showed continued weakness. &quot;Movie companies are having a very hot summer and box-office sales have soared to new records,&quot; said Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Hasbro termed the retail toy market &quot;sluggish&quot; but said it is &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about the rest of the year. Polaroid's improved results reflect a sharp cut in the number of employees.    Newspaper publishers continue to be helped by falling newsprint prices, although some still suffer from weak advertising sales. Broadcasters, on the other hand, still are paying for last year's writers' strike, but they should get a boost later from a big rebound in television-ad sales. &quot;There was a wide disparity in earnings of newspaper publishers,&quot; said Peter Appert, media analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. &quot;Gannett, Knight-Ridder and Washington Post all reported strong operating-income growth, but it was primarily on the benefits of declining newsprint prices, which have declined at least 10% since the end of last year. Some other companies, including New York Times, had soft earnings because of especially weak advertising markets in their areas.&quot; Knight-Ridder's net was lifted by the sale of a newspaper and five TV stations. Both Warner Communications and Time -- which is acquiring Warner -- posted gains.    Most airlines reported substantial improvements in second-quarter resultsthe result of higher fares and improved traffic. Many carriers also benefited from the fallout from the strike at Eastern Airlines. &quot;It was a terrific quarter,&quot; said Jack Hunter, an airline analyst at Howe Barnes Investments, Chicago. Not for Eastern, or its parent Texas Air. Even after a $250 million gain on the sale of its East Coast shuttle, Texas Air posted a loss, the legacy of the Eastern strike. Continental Airlines, another Texas Air unit, posted a modest profit, but not nearly enough to offset the cost of Eastern's strike and subsequent bankruptcy-law filing. Other carriers reported robust results. Delta's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings soared 85%. Most U.S. carriers were able to raise ticket prices despite fare cuts Eastern initiated. At UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, yield per mile, a measure of what passengers pay to fly, jumped 14%. USAir Group attributed its higher net primarily to stronger traffic. @ AUTOS @ -- MANUFACTURING @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 3 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Chrysler 341,000 320,000 + 7 @ Ford Motor 1,407,100 1,662,800 - 15 @ General Motors 1,454,200 1,506,700 - 3 @ TOTAL 3,202,300 3,489,500 - 8 @ -- PARTS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 8 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Dana Corp 42,900 42,700 0 @ Echlin Inc 13,544 17,901 - 24 @ Genuine Parts 50,008 45,460 + 10 @ Goodyear Tire 27,100 134,900 - 80 @ Johnson Controls 23,500 24,300 - 3 @ Masco Industries 28,480 31,760 - 10 @ Snap-On Tools 27,315 29,149 - 6 @ Timken Co 30,166 17,660 + 71 @ TOTAL 243,013 343,830 - 29 @ HOUSING @ -- HOME BUILDERS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 3 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Centex Corp 15,265 6,521 + 134 @ Kaufman andamp;

Consumer-food packagers such as Kellogg and pet-food giant Ralston Purina realized significant gross margin gains as good weather kept commodity prices flat. ConAgra's prepared-foods business achieved a 43% rise in operating earnings on a 15% sales gain. Gerber benefited from a baby-food sales surge tied to special promotions.    Some food retailers were upbeat, led by a 19% profit gain by industry giant Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea, a 29% jump by Giant Food and a 25% surge by Albertson's. They credit their increases to store expansions and cost-cutting programs. Grocery chains that didn't do well in the quarter attributed their problems to extraordinary factors. American Stores, which saw its quarter's profit fall 20%, said the drop largely resulted from interest expense associated with its 1988 acquisition of Lucky Stores.    Amid a rainier summer, the growth of domestic soft-drink volume slipped a bit, to 3%, but improved pricing helped CocaCola and PepsiCo post earnings gains. PepsiCo was also aided by higher snack-food and restaurant earnings. Rising raw-material costs and financing expenses accounted for Coca-Cola Enterprises' profit slide. Coca-Cola's third-quarter earnings will rise about 17%, estimates First Boston's Martin Romm, while PepsiCo's net, after the dilution effects from acquisitions, will rise about 10%.    Where health-care-service profits improved, the gains reflected the companies' shift into high-growth specialty services and higher prices for general-hospital care. Continued strong demand for psychiatric services helped Community Psychiatric Centers and National Medical Enterprises. National Medical's net was hurt by a $49.3 million loss from discontinued operations; profit from continuing operations rose 28%. American Medical International, which agreed to be acquired last month, had a 37% earnings decline due largely to poor cost controls while management was preoccupied with the sale.    Among medical-supply companies, Becton Dickinson's net was bolstered by a special $44.7 million gain; profit from continuing operations was flat. Sales and earnings growth of many medical suppliers were hurt by the stronger dollar.    Profit growth at pharmaceutical companies slowed as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar abroad. Merck said sales growth was reduced by four percentage points -- compared with one point in the previous quarter -- because of adverse foreign-currency translations. Despite the slowing, profits jumped ahead at those companies with newer drugs selling at premium prices. Lilly's profit surged on rocketing sales of Prozac, a new anti-depressant. Schering-Plough, Warner-Lambert and Merck also benefited from higher-priced products. But Bristol-Myers, Syntex, Upjohn and Pfizer were buffeted by slower sales of important drugs.    Sales were sluggish at some cosmetic companies. Cost-cutting helped Gillette and Avon. Gillette blamed its decline on foreign-exchange losses and on higher interest costs related to a stock buy-back. Diana Temple, analyst at Salomon Brothers, noted that the prestige cosmetics brands have performed stronger than the mass-merchandised brands. @ FOOD AND DRINK @ -- FOOD @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 20 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Archer Daniels Mid 116,819 74,749 + 56 @ Borden Inc 83,947 73,717 + 14 @ Campbell Soup 43,500 22,400 + 94 @ Castle andamp; Cooke 35,213 37,637 - 6 @ ConAgra Inc 197,878 154,698 + 28 @ CPC International 83,129 72,002 + 15 @ Dean Foods 22,163 8,327 + 166 @ Flowers Indust 7,573 17,127 - 56 @ General Mills Inc 35,600 54,900 - 35 @ Gerber Products 26,817 18,418 + 46 @ Heinz (H J) 117,201 101,697 + 15 @ Hershey Foods 25,080 28,649 - 12 @ Hormel (George A) 9,834 7,615 + 29 @ Kellogg Co 129,700 112,700 + 15 @ Lance Inc 11,033 10,887 + 1 @ McCormick andamp; Co 8,002 3,603 + 122 @ Ralston Purina 83,800 77,200 + 9 @ Tyson Foods Inc 27,474 21,085 + 30 @ Whitman Corp 27,600 55,800 - 51 @ Wrigley (Wm) Jr 34,127 30,291 + 13 @ TOTAL 1,126,490 983,502 + 15 @ -- FOOD RETAILERS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 10 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Albertson's Inc 44,391 35,443 + 25 @ American Stores 21,515 27,056 - 20 @ Circle K Corp -23,065 14,018 ... @ Fleming Cos 17,381 13,677 + 27 @ Food Lion 31,972 27,624 + 16 @ Giant Food 26,525 20,518 + 29 @ Great Atl andamp; Pac 45,390 38,047 + 19 @ Kroger Co -2,526 57,065 ... @ Super Valu Stores 41,060 38,882 + 6 @ Von's Cos -8,800 5,000 ... @ TOTAL 193,843 277,330 - 30 @ -- BEVERAGES @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 8 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Aandamp;W Brands Inc 1,995 1,409 + 42 @ Anheuser-Busch 233,700 211,500 + 10 @ Brown-Forman 21,255 18,949 + 12 @ Coca-Cola Btlg 1,581 2,784 - 43 @ Coca-Cola Co 345,519 303,058 + 14 @ Coca-Cola Enter 38,822 40,979 - 5 @ Coors (Adolph) 16,871 19,283 - 13 @ PepsiCo Inc 264,900 219,600 + 21 @ TOTAL 924,643 817,562 + 13 @ HEALTH CARE @ -- HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 4 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ American Med Int 21,087 33,715 - 37 @ Community Psych 23,457 19,731 + 19 @ Humana Inc 72,267 63,820 + 13 @ Nat'l Medical Enter 5,468 20,164 - 73 @ TOTAL 122,279 137,430 - 11 @ -- MEDICAL SUPPLIES @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 5 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Abbott Labs 212,555 185,284 + 15 @ Acuson Corp 9,339 6,447 + 45 @ Bard (C R) Inc 21,800 19,800 + 10 @ Baxter Int'l 104,000 91,000 + 14 @ Becton Dickinson 86,396 42,949 + 101 @ TOTAL 434,090 345,480 + 26 @ -- PHARMACEUTICALS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 13 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ American Home Prod 236,677 215,822 + 10 @ Bausch andamp; Lomb 27,399 23,638 + 16 @ Bristol-Myers 212,510 190,484 + 12 @ Lilly (Eli) andamp; Co 217,100 180,700 + 20 @ Marion Labs 70,470 39,751 + 77 @ Merck andamp; Co 396,600 316,300 + 25 @ Pfizer Inc 135,700 213,100 - 36 @ Rorer Group 12,402 11,354 + 9 @ Schering-Plough 120,500 101,000 + 19 @ Squibb Corp 133,000 114,000 + 17 @ Syntex Corp 74,800 73,600 + 2 @ Upjohn Co 94,583 87,772 + 8 @ Warner-Lambert 112,363 91,627 + 23 @ TOTAL 1,844,104 1,659,148 + 11 @ OTHERS @ -- COSMETICS/PERSONAL CARE @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 6 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Avon Products 39,500 -82,500 ... @ Gillette Co 62,500 67,800 - 8 @ Int'l Flavors andamp; F 41,254 38,779 + 6 @ Neutrogena 6,275 5,384 + 17 @ Noxell Corp 11,792 11,363 + 4 @ Tambrands 26,162 24,467 + 7 @ TOTAL 187,483 65,293 + 187 @ -- HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 7 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ American Brands 120,200 154,700 - 22 @ Colgate-Palmolive 73,596 65,501 + 12 @ Johnson andamp; Johnson 297,000 271,000 + 10 @ Philip Morris Cos 745,000 611,000 + 22 @ Rubbermaid Inc 28,210 24,315 + 16 @ Universal Corp 1,805 10,367 - 83 @ UST Inc 49,967 41,782 + 20 @ TOTAL 1,315,778 1,178,665 + 12 @ -- CONSUMER SERVICES @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 4 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Block (Handamp;R) Inc 115,491 106,106 + 9 @ CPI Corp 1,627 3,821 - 57 @ Kinder-Care Inc -71,879 14,124 ... @ Rollins Inc 10,554 12,396 - 15 @ TOTAL 55,793 136,447 - 59    (For part two of this story see: &quot;Quarterly Review of Corporate Earnings -- Part II&quot; -- WSJ Aug. 7, 1989) </TEXT></DOC>
