The justices unanimously said Congress was not justified when itpassed a law last year banning all sexually explicit telephonedial-up message services.   Congress may outlaw obscene telephone messages only, not indecentones, the court said. The dial-a-porn industry therefore must beallowed to survive, it said.   The ban violates free-speech rights when applied to ``indecent''messages, the court ruled.   An adult magazine's graphic centerfold or a movie love scene thatleaves nothing to the imagination may _ or may not _ be obscene.That's for a jury to decide. If such material is deemed onlyindecent, it is constitutionally protected.   In other action, the court:   _ Ruled that states are not required by the Constitution toprovide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initial roundof appeals.   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled in favor of Virginia officials whosaid requiring states to pay for attorneys in second-round appealscould lead to interminable delays in carrying out executions.   _ Made it more difficult for older workers to prove that whensome of their benefits are reduced their employers violated afederal law against age discrimination.   By a 7-2 vote, the court revived an Ohio pension law provisionchallenged by a woman forced to retire because of a disability.   _ Ruled that the Justice Department has a legal obligation tosupply a weekly tax magazine with copies of all federal trial courtopinions and orders in tax cases.   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, said the federal Freedom ofInformation Act imposes such a duty on the Justice Department's taxdivision.   A 1988 law made it a crime to use a telephone to make any``obscene or indecent'' communication for commercial purposes. Butits total ban was never imposed because U.S. District Judge A.Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles ruled it could be applied only toobscene _ not merely indecent _ phone messages.   The judge said that outlawing non-obscene messages, even thoughthey may be inappropriate for minors, violates the free-speechprotections of the Constitution's First Amendment.   Today, the nation's highest court said the law could be appliedto obscene messages, but not to indecent ones.   ``Sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene isprotected by the (Constitution's) First Amendment,'' Justice ByronR. White wrote for the court.   In an argument session before the justices last April, the Bushadministration urged that the total ban be reinstated.   Justice Department lawyer Richard Taranto said then that the banis needed to ``protect children from hearing patently offensivespeech.''   But Laurance Tribe, a Harvard law professor representing adial-a-porn company, said technological safeguards blockingchildren's access to the racy messages make a total ban unnecessaryand unconstitutional.   In today's decision, White said, ``It may well be that there isno fail-safe method of guaranteeing that never will a minor be ableto access the dial-a-porn system.''   But he said technological restrictions on the industry mightprove ``extremely effective, and only a few of the most enterprisingand disobedient young people will manage to secure access to suchmessages.''   The court's three most liberal justices in freedom-of-expressioncases _ William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens_ voted to strike down the law as it applies to obscene material aswell.   ``I have long been convinced that the exaction of criminalpenalties for the distribution of obscene materials to consentingadults is constitutionally intolerable,'' Brennan wrote in anopinion joined by Marshall and Stevens.   Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callersthrough 976 exchanges and ATandamp;T's 900 long-distance lines.   The telephone company typically charges callers according toper-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving theremainder to the dial-a-porn company.   The same exchanges also are used for other, non-controversialtypes of messages such as sports scores, time checks and weatherreports.   Born in 1983, the dial-a-porn industry matured quickly. Accordingto court records, in 1984 some 180 million calls were placed bycustomers in New York alone.   The industry's income last year topped $2 billion.   Congress in 1983 directed the Federal Communications Commissionto figure out ways children could be prevented from callingdial-a-porn services. A company's failure to adhere to those methodswas to be a crime.   The commission considered various means of restricting access tosexually explicit messages and eventually settled on access codes,scramblers and requiring credit card payment.   But an impatient Congress in 1988 enacted the outright ban.   Writing for the court, White said, ``Because the statute's denialof adult access to telephone messages which are indecent but notobscene far exceeds that which is necessary to limit the access ofminors to such messages, we hold that the ban does not surviveconstitutional scrutiny.''   Obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexuallyexplicit material.   The Supreme Court since 1973 had defined obscenity as a work thatappeals to a morbid interest in sex, is patently offensive and whentaken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political orscientific value.   Sexually explicit material, often called pornography, may or maynot be legally obscene.   In 1978, the court drew a distinction between obscene and``indecent'' expression when it allowed federal regulators torestrict the broadcast of indecent language.   Upholding the government's power to punish use of ``dirty words''carried on television or radio at times when children might belistening, the court adopted the FCC's definition of indecent _``patently offensive references to excretory and sexual organs oractivities.''   After Tashima's decision last July, the Reagan administrationappealed directly to the Supreme Court, challenging that part of theruling that protects indecent material.   Sable Communications of California Inc., a major purveyor ofdial-a-porn services in that state, filed a counter-appealchallenging the part of Tashima's ruling that allows the ban onmaterials judged to be obscene.   The cases are Sable Communications v. FCC, 88-515, and FCC vs.Sable Communications, 88-525.</TEXT></DOC>
