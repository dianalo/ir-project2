The guidelines, which have been distributed to all U.S.attorneys nationwide, spell out the standards under which thegovernment will pursue environmentally related indictmentsagainst corporations and their employees.</LP><TEXT>   Environmental lawyers say the guidelines for prosecutorsare significant because they address companies' growingconcern over whether their own internal audits will uncoverwrongdoing that will then subject them to criminal liabilityunder increasingly stringent environmental-law standards.Fearful of such prosecutions, some companies have beenreluctant to find out too much about their own environmentalshortcomings, lawyers say.   Justice Department officials said the 14-page memorandum,under consideration for more than a year, makes explicit theapproach that the department already endorses. &quot;We wanted toclear up any confusion,&quot; said Barry Bartman, acting assistantattorney general in charge of the Environment and NaturalResources division.   The memorandum, which Justice Department officials saidhas been made available to anyone who asked for it, providesa general policy statement as well as nine hypotheticalexamples of how a company's detection, and prompt disclosureand correction, of environmental crime can reduce or eveneliminate criminal liability.   At one extreme is &quot;Company A,&quot; described as the ideal casequalifying for &quot;prosecution leniency.&quot; According to thememorandum, &quot;Company A regularly conducts a comprehensiveaudit of its compliance with environmental requirements.&quot;And, as soon as something wrong is turned up, it goesstraight to the government, disciplines the responsiblepeople in the company and provides their names as well as allrelevant documentation to the government.   &quot;Company Z&quot; is the rotten apple. It tries to cover up anenvironmental violation. It doesn't cooperate with thegovernment or provide names. Its audit is narrow, and itscompliance program is &quot;no more than a collection of paper.&quot;For &quot;Company Z,&quot; leniency is &quot;unlikely.&quot;   In between are other examples to guide U.S. attorneys. &quot;Idon't view this as a get-out-of-jail-free card,&quot; said DennisC. Vacco, U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York.&quot;We're going to use the carrot of this document, but ifcorporations fall outside the parameters, they can restassured that they'll get whacked real hard,&quot; added Mr. Vacco,who heads the attorney general's new subcommittee onenvironmental law.   &quot;Corporatewide audits, everyone agrees, are the best wayto ensure environmental compliance,&quot; said Stanley M.Spracker, a Washington-based partner in the law firm Weil,Gotshal andamp; Manges. &quot;To leave open the possibility ofsubstantial criminal penalties gives the governmentenforcement engine too much of a heavy hand.&quot;   However, other attorneys said the government should haveprovided complete immunity to information collected throughinternal audits. But Rick Hind, a Washington lobbyist for theenvironmental group Greenpeace, said that the threat of jailtime is a necessary way to ensure corporate compliance.   ---   CITING PRINCETON/NEWPORT, judge may let fraud defendantwithdraw plea.   A federal judge in Manhattan is reconsidering whether toallow Jeffrey L. Feldman, the alleged head of a $140 milliontax-fraud scheme, to back out of his 1990 guilty plea.Although Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. denied the request inMarch, he now has asked Mr. Feldman and prosecutors to fileadditional briefs addressing whether the appeals-courtdecision in the Princeton/Newport Partners L.P. case affectsMr. Feldman's request.   Mr. Feldman, who Judge Haight sentenced to two years inprison, now says he pleaded guilty even though he didn'trealize he was breaking the law when the alleged taxtransactions occurred. &quot;I had no intent to commit a crimewhen the trades in question in my case were done,&quot; he said ina court filing. Mr. Feldman hasn't yet begun serving hissentence.   In Princeton/Newport, the Second U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals three months ago reversed tax-fraud and otherconvictions, partly because the defendants weren't allowed toargue that a &quot;good faith&quot; effort was made to comply with thetax law in the transactions at issue in the case. The appealscourt said in that decision that such a defense is especiallyimportant in tax-fraud cases because federal taxation is &quot;oneof the most esoteric areas of the law.&quot;   Judge Haight said that because the Princeton/Newportdecision &quot;dealt with the issue of intent in tax-fraud cases,&quot;it &quot;is arguably applicable&quot; to Mr. Feldman's request.   Neither Mr. Feldman's attorney nor federal prosecutorsdiscussed the Princeton/Newport decision in documents filedin connection with Mr. Feldman's efforts to withdraw hisguilty plea. The U.S. attorney's office counters in a courtfiling that, &quot;in unambiguous and unequivocal terms, Feldmanadmitted that he knew at the time of the subject activitiesthat he was violating the law.&quot;   ---   FORMER CHICAGO JUDGE found guilty of bribery and extortioncharges.   David J. Shields, who was defended by prominent defenseattorney Dan K. Webb, was convicted of taking bribes from anattorney acting as a government informant in order to fix a1988 civil case.   Mr. Shields's former position as presiding judge of thechancery division made him the second-highest judge in CookCounty, which is the largest single court system in thenation.   Mr. Shields's co-defendant, attorney Pasquale F. De Leo,was convicted of delivering $6,000 in bribes to Mr. Shieldson behalf of the informant. Both Messrs. Shields and De Leodenied any wrongdoing; and Mr. Shields's attorney yesterdayvowed to appeal the verdict.   The government's main evidence against Mr. Shields camefrom tape recordings secretly made in his chambers in thesummer of 1988. Mr. Shields was only the second sitting judgein U.S. history to have his chambers bugged by prosecutorsseeking evidence. Many observers had considered a convictionwould be difficult, given the poor quality of the tapes.Sentencing is scheduled for late January.   During the 1980s, a federal investigation known asOperation Greylord rocked the Cook County courts, resultingin the convictions of numerous judges, lawyers, clerks andpolice officers. Mr. Shields's defense attorney, Mr. Webb,was the U.S. attorney during that time and one of theGreylord prosecutors.   ---   FAILED PHOTO OP: Defense attorney Frank Rubino made anunsuccessful attempt yesterday to introduce a photograph ofPresident Bush with former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriegaas evidence in Mr. Noriega's trial on federal drug charges.U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler apparently rejected theintroduction of the photograph during a brief hearing at hisbench, although he didn't make his ruling public. Thephotograph apparently was part of an effort by Mr. Rubino tocounter government evidence, including photographs, ofmeetings Mr. Noriega had with Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, aswell as with convicted and suspected drug dealers.</TEXT></DOC>
