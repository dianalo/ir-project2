Klein</HL><DATE>12/13/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><LP>   West Allis, Wis. -- America's two best hopes for goldmedals at February's Winter Olympics in Albertville sat ashort distance apart in the warming house at the U.S. speedskating team's weathered training facility here the otherday, answering questions from news types. It was the team'sannual media day, but the reportorial turnout was smallerthan that for your run-of-the-gym NBA game.   Bonnie Blair, who set a world record in winning the goldmedal at 500 meters in the 1988 Games at Calgary -- one ofbut two golds the U.S. would capture at that fest -- wasdiscussing the fleeting nature of fame in a sport that existsfor the general U.S. public only during the few days everyfour years that it is on the Olympic stage.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I made a few ads, went to the White House with the restof the team and was a guest of honor at the Indy 500, butthere wasn't much else,&quot; the engaging 27-year-old told threenote-takers. She smiled and continued: &quot;I'm recognized on thestreet sometimes -- in my hometown {Champaign, Ill.} and inButte, Montana, where I train sometimes. I think the problemis that we wear those hooded Lycra suits when we compete, sonobody ever gets to see me with hair on TV. But I loveskating, and don't think I've reached my full potential init.&quot;   Dan Jansen was sitting on the floor a few feet away,entertaining a slightly larger group. He was a favorite inthe 500- and 1,000-meter men's races at Calgary, but themorning of the 500 his older sister Jane, a young housewifeand mother, died of leukemia. A distraught Jansen debatedcompeting and then did so, only to take a rare fall on thefirst turn. Four days later, racing again in the 1,000, hewas on a goldmedal pace through 600 meters but fell again.The photo of him on the ice after that spill, face in hands,became a lasting image of those Games.   Jansen's failure, and its background, was captivating in away the success of others wasn't, and he came out of Calgarya hero. He won something called the Olympic Spirit award, wassingled out for special praise by President Reagan and therewas talk about a TV movie of his life. And it was hispicture, not Blair's, that would grace a cereal box(Kellogg's Corn Flakes).   The boyish, 26-year-old native of this suburb of Milwaukeestill expresses puzzlement over that turn of events. &quot;Isuppose I was a good `story,' but it bothered me to get allthat attention after other people, especially Bonnie,performed so much better than I did,&quot; he said. &quot;That wholeperiod is still weird to think back on. A littleuncomfortable, too.&quot;   He goes on: &quot;I'm often asked if I'm out for revenge thistime. The answer is no. Nobody did anything bad to me atCalgary, so there's nothing to get revenge for. But this timeI'd like to show people the real me on ice. And this sportbeing what it is, the Olympics are my only real chance to dothis.&quot;   So here were the two athletes, friends as well asteammates, looking forward to another Games. But for speedskaters, unlike participants in some other, more lucrativesports, getting there is a good deal less than half the fun.   Yes, the Olympics have gone pro, and today's top U.S.speed skaters receive financial subsidies through theirnational governing body. For Blair and Jansen, there havebeen additional emoluments: Public appearances for Blair onbehalf of several corporations, and a white-collar job forthe recently married Jansen at Miller Brewing Co. thatpermits him to maintain his training schedule. For Blairespecially, it's a step up from 1988, when the police inChampaign held fund-raisers to support her training, but shealso speaks for Jansen when she points out that she's &quot;far,far, far from the Michael Jordan class.&quot;   &quot;I'm 27,&quot; she said, &quot;and still need two years of creditsfor my college degree. Ask me where I live and I have no goodanswer; I have some belongings here, some at my mom's houseand some at a sister's in Colorado Springs. Speed skatingfinally has a World Cup circuit with cash prizes, but I wonat Warsaw {Poland} last week and a first place was worth$310. So you can't say we're in it for the money.&quot;   There is, moreover, no certainty that the pair's fouryears of hard work since Calgary will pay off in a medal ofgold or any other hue. That's partly because the 500- and1,000-meter &quot;sprints&quot; in which they compete are settled bytiny fractions of a second, and the slightest misstep can befatal. Blair's 500-meter victory in 1988, for instance, wasby a margin of .02-second over runner-up Christa Rothenburgerof East Germany, and the difference between first place and15th in the men's version of that event was 1.05 seconds.   How much will there be to choose between the top eight or10 men and women in the sprints at Albertville? &quot;About thismuch,&quot; confirms Peter Mueller, the U.S. speed skatingco-coach for the coming Games, rubbing together his thumb andforefinger.   But Blair stood first in World Cup points in both sprintsbefore returning to the U.S. last week, and Jansen was aclose second in the 500 to Germany's Uwe-Jens Mey, theCalgary winner. And Mueller, an Olympic gold medalist himself(at 1,000 meters in 1976), says that if anyone deserves afavorite's role, they do. &quot;Dan and Bonnie have the physicaland mental strength it takes to succeed,&quot; he avers. &quot;If theyget good trips, they should do all right.&quot;   Mueller coached Blair and Jansen as teenagers before asojourn in Germany, and both skaters say his return as anOlympic coach has helped enliven their training routines.Among other things, he used roller skating to break themonotony of the running, bicycling and weight lifting thatdominate their summer regimens, and gave them time for fairlyfrequent golfing outings (both are decent players).   &quot;But it was the skating that kept us coming back -- theidea of going faster on our own two feet than any otherhumans,&quot; offered Jansen. &quot;With the stuff we have to put upwith, you know that has to be pretty good.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
