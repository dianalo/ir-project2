(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A congress of Latvian activists onSaturday debated plans for independence from the Soviet Uniondespite fears the Kremlin might impose an economic blockade inretaliation.   While red hammer-and-sickle flags fluttered over Riga for thenational holiday known as Soviet Constitution Day, the 1,074delegates of the People's Front of Latvia considered a program thatdenounced the Soviet system as ``feudal.'' The plan calls for afree market economy based on private property and profit.   ``The last half century has seen the rule of an absurd economicsystem, the absence of human rights, and an administrativearbitrariness, which has led Latvia to national, economic andecological catastrophes,'' the movement's draft plan said.   The program is a 126-point list of goals aimed at building anindependent economy and social structure in Latvia before it wouldsecede from the Soviet Union.   It calls for human rights, competing political parties, privatebusiness, and an end to Communist Party domination.   It also demands an end to discrimination against intellectuals,abolition of privileges in the distribution of scarce apartmentsand food, and restoration of Latvian geographical names.   People's Front President Dainis Ivans said the program facesstrong opposition, especially from radicals who are registeringLatvians to vote for an alternative parliament that would quicklydeclare independence.   He said the delegates to the congress represent 300,000supporters of the People's Front.   The ``centrist'' draft program under debate Saturday sets nodate for independence and conforms in many ways to the reforms ofSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   For example, Gorbachev has backed economic independence for theBaltic states, which also include Estonia and Lithuania, to bothappease activists and advance reform of the Soviet economy.   The program also avoids the popular street slogan in Riga, theLatvian capital, that demands removal of the Soviet ``occupation''army. Instead the Popular Front calls for the demilitarization ofLatvia.   Ivans and other leaders spoke agains any abrupt declaration ofindependence. ``We all know that no empire has given up its loot ofits free will,'' he said.   If the Soviet Union should try to blockade Latvia economicallyto pressure it back into the fold, Latvia could lose the majorityof its energy supplies, including all of its gasoline, economistArnmis Kalnins told the delegates. It could also forfeit 38 percentof its consumer goods, he said.   ``The political situation doesn't show Western countries wouldbe willing to give support at the risk of offending the SovietUnion,'' he added.   The congress, expected to end with a vote on the independenceplatform Sunday evening, was businesslike in comparison with theeuphoria of the People's Front's first congress one year ago.   At that time, 150,000 people jammed a park outside the CommunistParty's House of Political Education to weep in joy at the sound ofonce-forbidden folk songs and at the sight of the flag ofonce-independent Latvia.   During the past year the Latvian Parliament has passed measuresclaiming the right to veto Soviet laws, making Latvian the officiallanguage and restoring minority schools.   Estonia and Lithuania also have pressed for increased autonomyduring the past year.   At last year's congress, however, the Latvian activists madecalls only for an ill-defined ``sovereignty'' rather thanindependence from Moscow.   On Saturday, Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov, a closeassociate of Gorbachev, told reporters he was not disturbed by thenew calls for independence because the proposal was offered in ademocratic manner.   But he said he will oppose parts of the program concerning thepath to independence and local control.   Speaking of Latvian independence, he said ``at the present time,there are neither the social nor economic preconditions.''</TEXT></DOC>
