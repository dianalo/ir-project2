Councilman Nate Holden on Tuesday offered to pay up to $300 forsuch weapons from a $50,000 campaign fund, a plan derided as``spitballs at battleships'' by a spokeswoman for Mayor TomBradley's re-election campaign.   Meanwhile, Police Chief Daryl Gates appeared on ABC's``Nightline'' Wednesday night to renew his call to outlaw assaultrifles. Today, he was expected to announce plans to form a committeeto explore a 1990 gubernatorial run.   Assault rifles became a political issue after an AK-47 was usedlast week by drifter Patrick Purdy to fire more than 100 bulletsinto a schoolyard. Purdy killed five students and wounded 29 othersand a teacher before killing himself.   Holden said Wednesday the buy-back plan might stem gang slayings.``Any Uzi or AK-47 that we can get out of the hands of our citizensand into the hands of law enforcement, where they belong, anddestroyed, would be a step forward,'' he said.   Bradley spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the mayor opposes the saleof semiautomatic rifles altogether and favors comprehensive lawsrather than a buy-back.   Holden on Wednesday said a woman who kept the Uzi under her bedfor several years turned it in to ``get it out of her life.''   A 16-year-old and a 23-year-old man brought unloaded AK-47s totwo police stations, police said. The teen-ager said he received therifle as a gift and ``just wanted to be rid of it,'' said spokesmanLt. Fred Nixon.</TEXT></DOC>
