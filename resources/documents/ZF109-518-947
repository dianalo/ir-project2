(Computer-Aided Design-Automatic Test Equipment)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Dunn, Peter.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The Electronic Design Interchange Format (EDIF) Test Extension andthe Waveform and Vector Exchange Specification (Waves) are datastandards intended to simplify the exchange of integrated circuit(IC) design information between computer-aided design (CAD)programs and automatic test equipment (ATE).andP;  The Test Extensionis an addition to ANSI's EDIF specification and is supported byIBM and Philips groups, while Waves, which developed from IEEEstandards work, is supported by Teradyne, LTX, Schlumberger andthe Air Force's Rome Air Development Center.andP;  The Test Extensionwill be incorporated into EDIF updates 2.3 and 3.0.0 and willinclude compact data files, boundary scan design support andanalog capabilities.andP;  Waves represents logic signals with waveformand event value models, and no single standard logic model isused.andP;  Software exchanges could be made based on the models ratherthan specific equipment.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     StandardsComputer-aided designAutomatic Test EquipmentData ConversionStandardizationIntegrated circuits.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
