Col. Horst Romeis said Friday over a camp lunch of soup, a rolland East German beer. ``It needs some time to develop. The weatheris getting colder.''   As of Friday, only 14 people had turned up at the receptioncenter normally used to train civil defense recruits in this drabindustrial city 25 miles east of the West German border town ofHelmstedt.   More than 200,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany thisyear. In the new reform mood of the past two weeks, the governmenthas urged the refugees and emigres to come home.   Nationwide figures are sketchy, but they suggest that perhapsseveral hundred former refugees or emigres have taken advantage ofthe invitation to return.   The East German government hastily set up centers to welcomeback up to 10,000 returnees. But of the 18 reception centers openedMonday in Magdeburg district, all but two had closed by Friday forlack of business.   A returnee arriving Thursday evening by train in Magdeburg,about an hour's ride from the West German border, would have beendirected to an apprentices' residence, a brisk 15-minute walk fromthe train station.   But the home had gone back to its original purpose earlier inthe day after only seven returnees showed up.   ``Our 350 apprentices were angry that they had to interrupttheir training for people who had turned their backs on us,'' saidresidence supervisor Hans-Georg Friedebold, 32. ``That'sunderstandable.''   Romeis predicts a bigger inflow of disoriented, needy returneesin the coming weeks as East Germans find a new life is not so easyto build in capitalist West Germany.   The few East Germans who had turned up to enjoy Romeis'hospitality included a family of six who ran out of money and wereunwelcome with their West German relations, and two teen-agers whowere obeying parents' orders to end their two-week adventure in theWest.   Klaus-Dieter Krueger, 16, and Matthias Langner, 15, fled on amotorcycle via Czechoslovakia on Nov. 4, just five days before EastGermany's surprise decision to open its borders.   In a refugee camp near Cologne they received clothes and about$100 from the government.   ``We just stayed lazy and rode around the country,'' Kruegersaid.   Matthias' parents, taking advantage of the new travel freedom,crossed the border, found the boys in the refugee camp on Thursdayand told them to come home.   Matthias Paessler made his own decision to return after a yearand a half in West Germany.   ``It's not bad over there but you dream too much about making acareer and all that,'' said Paessler. ``Back here, it's moresecure.''   Living in a small Bavarian village with his family provedfrustrating.   ``The young people were cold,'' he said. ``They gave you strangelooks if you didn't smoke hash with them. The girls had thisattitude of `I'm so rich.'''   He worked odd jobs and made enough money to visit London,Belgium and Canada, but couldn't afford his own apartment in WestGermany's extremely tight housing market.</TEXT></DOC>
