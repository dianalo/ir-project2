Goals of the Office of Human Development Services (HDS)The Program Administrations within the Office of Human Development Services(HDS), although different from one another in the specific populationsthey serve and the varied programs which they administer, share a commonmission: to reduce dependency and increase self-sufficiency among our mostvulnerable citizens. Emphasis on this mission, and progress toward it,will help more Americans live independent lives. In the end, it will reducetheir need for services.We have left an era when the trend was to assign to the Federal governmentan ever-increasing responsibility for identifying the needs for socialservices and for designing programs to meet those needs. Current publicpolicy dictates that decisions are best made at the level of governmentclosest to the target populations served_by elected State and local officials,by those who manage social services at the State and local levels, includingGovernment officials, Tribal leaders, private organizations, voluntaryorganizations, schools or religious organizations. Therefore, HDS supportsa policy that social service needs are more effectively and efficientlydefined and addressed at the State and local community levels. With thisin mind, HDS has identified three goals to help families and individualsachieve self-sufficiency and independence. These goals are:andbullet; To increase family and individual self-sufficiency and independencethrough social and economic development strategies;andbullet; To target Federal assistance to those most in need; andandbullet; To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of State, local andtribally-administered human services.In order to be considered for funding each applicant must describe activitiesthat meet the goals of HDS.The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN), an agency of theAdministration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), and the Administrationon Aging (AoA) have in the past participated in the HDS Coordinated DiscretionaryFunds Program (CDP). However, because of recent legislation, these twoprograms will not be included in this solicitation.As in previous years, NCCAN must solicit public comment on proposed researchand demonstration projects in the area of child abuse and neglect. Thetiming of the reauthorization of the Child Abuse Prevention and TreatmentAct, signed into law on April 25, 1988, precluded participation in thisannouncement. NCCAN will publish a separate request for comment and a separategrant announcement for FY 1989. The National Center may be contacted directlyat the following address: National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Children'sBureau, Administration for Children, Youth and Families, Donohoe Building,Room 2030-D, 400 6th Street SW., Washington, DC 20024.<T3>Contact person: </T3>Susan A. Weber, <T3>Telephone: </T3>(202) 755-7600.AoA will also publish a separate grant announcement in the fall of 1988.AoA should be contacted directly at the following address for informationregarding its announcement: Administration on Aging, Office of ProgramDevelopment, Room 4256, Cohen Building, 300 Independence Avenue SW., Washington,DC 20201.<T3>Contact person: </T3>Ed Marcus, <T3>Telephone: </T3>(202) 245-0441.B. The HDS Program AdministrationBelow is a brief description of the HDS programs related to this solicitationfor applications.<ITAG tagnum="81">Administration For Children, Youth and Families</ITAG>The Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) serves as thefocal point within the Federal government for programs, activities andconcerns designed to improve the quality of life for children, youth andfamilies. ACYF administers the following programs which relate to discretionarygrants under this announcement:andCx.1; <T3>Head Start </T3>provides comprehensive services primarily to low-incomepreschool children, age three to the age of compulsory school attendance,and their families. Head Start programs provide comprehensive educationalhealth, nutritional, social and other services.andCx.1; <T3>Child Welfare Services </T3>assists State public social service agenciesto provide services with the goal of keeping families together. State servicesinclude preventive intervention; services to develop alternative placementssuch as foster care or adoption; and reunification services so that childrencan return home if at all possible.andCx.1; <T3>Child Welfare Training </T3>provides discretionary grants to publicand private nonprofit institutions of higher learning to develop and improveeducational and training programs as well as resources for child welfareservices providers by upgrading their skills and qualifications.andCx.1; <T3>Adoption Opportunities </T3>provides discretionary demonstration grantsto eliminate barriers to adoption and find permanent homes for children,particularly children with special needs.andCx.1; <T3>Runaway and Homeless Youth </T3>addresses the crisis needs of runawayand homeless youth and their families through the establishment or strengtheningof community-based programs providing temporary shelter, counseling, andaftercare services. It also provides support to coordinated network grantsdesigned to share information, expertise, and resources among service providers;and to a toll-free, 24-hour National Runaway Switchboard which serves asa neutral channel of communication between young people and their familiesas well as a source of referral to needed services.<ITAG tagnum="81">Administration on Developmental Disabilities</ITAG>The Administration of Developmental Disabilities (ADD), provides assistanceto States and public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations toassure that all persons with developmental disabilities can receive theservices, assistance and other opportunities necessary to enable them toachieve their maximum potential through increased independence, productivityand integration in the community. Recent changes made by the DevelopmentalDisabilities and Bill of Rights Act of 1987 emphasized that persons withdevelopmental disabilities include those with severe functional limitationsattributable to physical impairments, mental impairments and combinationsof physical and mental impairments. In addition, ADD seeks to enhance therole of the family in assisting persons with developmental disabilitiesto achieve their maximum potential as well as ensuring the protection oftheir legal and human rights. ADD funds projects of national significanceto States and public and private nonprofit agencies for projects relatingto persons with dvelopmental disabilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">Administration For Native Americans</ITAG>The mission of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) is to promotethe goal of social and economic self-sufficiency for American Indians,Native Hawaiians and Alaska Natives. ANA defines self-sufficiency as thelevel of development at which a Native American community can control andinternally generate resources to provide for the needs of its members andmeet its own short and long range social and economic goals.C. Goals Of The HDS Coordinated Discretionary Funds Program and Its Cross-ProgramFocusFor the past seven years, the HDS CDP has brought the major portion ofthe research and demonstration funding under one announcement.The CDP allows HDS to expand the boundaries of human service knowledgeby drawing on the testing new ideas, disseminating the findings, and incorporatingthe same new ideas in a ``cross-program'' approach within HDS. In thisway, the CDP becomes an integral part of the policy making process.In addition to facilitating ``cross-program'' approaches, these researchand demonstration projects provide the basis for modifying current policyand practice in order to address changing social service needs. The CDPallows HDS, together with States, nonprofit, voluntary and philanthropicorganizations, and local communities, to analyze trends and anticipatesocial issues that will become paramount in the future; and to improvethe effectiveness and efficiency of human services by developing innovativealternate techniques and approaches to address social service needs. Additionally,the CDP makes possible a coordinated use of information systems in a moreefficient and less costly grant making activity than would be possibleif done independently.The HDS CDP is based on the principle that the well-being of a specifictarget population is the responsibility of individuals, families, and thecommunities in which the target populations live. Human service needs arebest defined, as well as more effective and efficiently served, throughinstitutions and organizations at the level closest to the individual-State,Tribal, and local governments, public agencies, businesses, private sectorand voluntary organizations, religious institutions, communities, and families.HDS is primarily interested in providing funds for projects offering immediateimpact, or which can become self-sustaining in a short period of time.The CDP is not intended to provide funds for ongoing social services, orto serve as a supplemental source of funds for local activities which needoperating subsidies.Through the CDP, two or more Program Administrations within HDS have jointlyaddressed issues or needs in which each has program and discretionary interest.For example: early childhood education has program/descretionary interestnot only to ACYF's Head Start program, but also for ADD because it dealswith children who may have developmental disabilities. More than a fewsuch social service issues and needs fit into such a ``Cross-Program''category.In addition to those topics identified as major agency-wide interests ofHDS in the crosscutting section, there are several other priority areaswhich address multi-service system issues. Examples are the priority areastargeting on: Children in homeless families living in shelters and themental health needs of developmentally disabled children being served bythe child welfare system.D. Youth 2000 InitiativeSome of the priority areas in this announcement relate to a special initiativewhich was lauched in July 1986 as a joint effort between the Departmentof Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor. Designed as anationwide ``call to action'' between now and the year 2000, the purposeof the initiative is to enlist the involvement of all sectors of societyin helping vulnerable and at-risk youth achieve social and economic self-sufficiencyand fulfill their potential as viable, contributing members of society.The goals of Youth 2000 are:andbullet; To increase the employability and self-sufficiency of young people;andbullet; To improve their literacy and educational attainment;andbullet; To reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancy;andbullet; To promote lifestyles free from alcohol and other substance abuse;and andbullet; To reduce violent and accidental injuries and deaths among youngpeople.Within HHS, the Office of Human Development Services has been assignedthe legal responsibility for managing and coordinating this initiativeunder the Secretary's Agenda for promoting the ``Future of the Family.''The Public Health Service has the lead responsibility for the Youth 2000goals related to reducing the youth mortality rate. The Family SupportAdministration has the lead responsibility for the Youth 2000 goal relatedto reducing the incidence of teenage pregnancy.E.

Statutory AuthoritiesThe individual statutory authorities under which grants and cooperativeagreements will be awarded through the HDS Coordinated Discretionary FundsProgram are as follows: andbullet; Head Start: Head Start Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9831 <T3>et seq.</T3>);andbullet; Child Welfare Services: section 426 of the Social Security Act,as amended (42 U.S.C. 626); andbullet; Runaway Youth Program: Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended(42 U.S.C. 5701 <T3>et seq.</T3>);andbullet; Adoption Opportunities: Title II of the Child Abuse Preventionand Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5111<T3>et seq.</T3>);andbullet; Native Americans: Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended(42 U.S.C. 2991 <T3>et seq.</T3>);andbullet; Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of1987, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6000); andandbullet; Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, as amended (42 U.S.C.10401 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="82">Part II_Priority Areas</ITAG>This part contains the information needed in order to successfully applyfor funding. Failure to comply with the eligibility criteria and minimumrequirements of a particular priority area will result in an applicationbeing screened out.HDS experience has shown that an application which is broad and generalin concept does not score as well as one which is directly responsive toand which addresses the concerns of a specific priority area. Applicantsshould carefully read each relevant priority area description before theybegin to write their narratives.Applicants must identify under which specific priority area they wish tohave their application considered. Applications that are general in natureor which do not specifically address the ``Minimum Requirements'' sectionof a priority area will be screened out. These and other screening criteriacan be found in Part III. C., Application Screening Criteria.Applications that are developed jointly by State, local and community-basedsocial services agencies, foundations or universities are encouraged, sincethis helps to coordinate local resources and assure continuation of theproject after Federal funding ends. On all applications developed jointly,one organization must be identified as the lead organization and applicant.A. Eligible ApplicantsEach priority area description contains information about the types oforganizations which are eligible to apply under that priority area. Sinceeligibility varies from priority area to priority area, it is criticalthat you read the ``Eligible Applicants'' section under each priority areacarefully. Applications from organizations that do not meet the eligibilityrestrictions for the specific priority area will not be reviewed. Onlyorganizations, not individuals, are eligible to apply under any of thepriority areas. For-profit organizations may be eligible for certain grants to be foundunder the authority of the Native American Programs Act, the Runaway andHomeless Youth Act and the Head Start Act. For-profit organizations mayalso participate as contractors under grants to eligible applicants onall projects.  Nonprofit agencies which have not previously received HDS support mustsubmit proof of nonprofits status with their grant applications. This canbe done either by making reference to its listing in the Internal RevenueService's (IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations or by submittinga copy of its letter from IRS (IRS Code section 501 (c)(3)). HDS cannotfund a nonprofit applicant without acceptable proof of its status.  B. Available Funds  The availability of funds for FY 1989 is dependent on an enactment of anappropriations Act. HDS expects to award new grants and cooperative agreementsresulting from this announcement during the second and third quarters ofFY 1989.  Applicants should be aware that HDS receives 2,000 to 3,000 applicationsannually in response to the CDP announcement. HDS expects to make approximately200 new awards pursuant to this announcement. The Federal share of theseprojects ranges from $10,000 to a maximum of $150,000 per budget period(except where noted in the priority area descriptions), with an averageaward of $100,000.  Applications with budgets that exceed the Federal share listed under theapplicable priority area will be automatically screened out. Actual awardsmay vary widely. HDS encourages eligible applicants requesting smallerawards (or awards for projects of less than 12 months duration) to apply.Unless specifically stated in the priority area description, there is nopredetermined number of applications to be funded in the various priorityareas.  C. Indexes of Priority Areas  To simplify use of this announcement, two indexes are presented below foreasy reference by potential applicants.

Collaborationis defined as the substantive involvement of at least three major organizationswithin a community._Discuss how this collaborative network will provide for early identificationand intervention to prevent dysfunctional behaviors for pre-teens ages9-12._Provide a detailed discussion of the local network, including a descriptionof the services to be offered, criteria for determining the pre-teens tobe served, qualifications of provider(s), and costs involved._Explain how this network differs from other pre-teen intervention servicesavailable within the community and what makes it innovative._Discuss an evaluation methodology to determine the effectiveness of thecollaborative network.Background Information: Statistics abound on the conditions of troubledyouth_levels of illiteracy, poor school performance, failure to completehigh school, drug and alcohol abuse, unemployment, suicides and homicides.Attempted solutions to these problems have been typically reactive andtargeted on youth during their later teen years. Little attention has beengiven to early identification and intervention at the primary and juniorhigh school levels to prevent future teen problems.Schools have generally viewed their role as being educational, exclusiveof health or social services. Early identification by schools of childrenat-risk and a coordinated approach to intervention or remediation can bestbe achieved through strong working relationships and interagency agreementsamong the school, health, social service agencies and local community foundations.Local community foundations and/or community agencies should have the latitudeof pulling together these and other divergent resources to develop a localnetwork that can serve all high-risk children in their community, regardlessof the school they attend.1.2A Prevention and Treatment of Alcohol Abuse among Minority YouthEligibility Criteria: State, local, Tribal or private organizations/agencies,Alaska Native Villages, nonprofit community based Native American organizationsor Indian-controlled academic institutions. These organizations must havesignificant experience in dealing with one or more minority groups.Purpose: To develop innovative models which use culturally sensitive intervention,treatment and/or prevention techniques aimed at minority youth who abusealcohol.Duration of projects: Not to exceed 2 yearsFederal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $50,000 per yearMinimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Indicate the minority(ies) being addressed; provide a statistical overviewof alcohol abuse within the culture; provide specific statistics for theminority population within the geographic service area._Identify cultural and/or sociological factors which encourage alcoholabuse and inhibit the effectiveness of current prevention and/or interventionand treatment techniques._Outline the proposed intervention, treatment and/or prevention techniquesaimed at the minority youth group. Treatment by existing programs is encouraged,rather than the development of new services to be supported by this grant.It should include a discussion of how this methodology is culturally sensitive._Identify any partnerships or coalitions that are formed to undertake thisdemonstration project. The types and amount of participation and commitmentby different groups should be clearly outlined._Describe how the proposed project builds upon the existing service deliverysystem and expands its capabilities, if appropriate._Discuss an evaluation methodology to determine the effectiveness of theproject and to validate the local statistical data used._Describe how the project will continue after Federal funds are exhausted.HDS will give preference to applications which include this information.Background Information: The 1986 <T3>Report on the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health </T3>clearlystated that there are major problems involving minority youth and alcoholwhich have not been sufficiently addressed. The Report continues, ``thereis also emerging consensus among scientists and clinicians that alcoholismand related problems are coupled, and involve a wide range of medical,social, and legal problems which impact different populations at risk indifferent ways.''Studies on the impact of alcoholism within Black families show that interventiontechniques which are effective within non-minority families fail with Blackfamilies. Similarly, the Secretary's Report found that any interventionstrategies must be sensitive to the Black culture.Over 50 percent of the Hispanic population is under the age of 25 and themedian age is getting lower. Alcohol consumption is widely regarded withinthe Hispanic community as a sign of ``machismo.'' Male adolescents areparticularly susceptible not only to peer pressure but also to adult pressureto abuse alcohol. Alcohol is also used to cope with stresses caused byunemployment, alienation from the surrounding society, separation fromfamily, discrimination in employment and housing. The Secretary's Reporturges the targeting of prevention efforts on Hispanic youth and young adultmales.There have been extensive studies and on-going demonstration projects onthe alcohol problem within the Native American and Alaska Native populations.HDS is particularly interested in developing culturally sensitive interventionand/or prevention strategies which are focused on Native American youth.For example, in the Alaska Native community, alcoholism can be consideredthe number one health problem among Alaskan youth. One major obstacle inproviding intervention and treatment is the distance between the sourceof help and the youth.During the last couple of years the Administration on Native Americans(ANA) has funded demonstration grants in the area of alcohol preventionamong all segments of the Native American population. We are now interestedin funding culturally sensitive prevention and/or intervention strategiesfor Native American youth in either urban and rural areas that build onthis prior work.The 1986 <T3>Report on the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health </T3>canbe obtained by contacting: DHHS/Public Health Service, Office of MinorityHealth, Room 118-F, Hubert H. Humphrey Building, 200 Independence Avenue,SW., Washington, DC 20201, (202) 245-0020.1.2B Prevention and Treatment of Alcohol Abuse Among Native American Youthin Runaway and Homeless Youth CentersEligibility Criteria: Runaway and Homeless Youth Centers, Alaska NativeVillages, nonprofit community based Native American organizations or Indian-controlledacademic institutions.Purpose: To build upon and adapt the experience of 6 projects funded in1986 by ACYF to ``Improve Shelter Staff Capacity to Deal with Problemsof Alcohol Abuse Among Runaway and Homeless Youth'' to benefit Native Americanyouth.Duration of projects: Not to exceed 2 years.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $50,000 per project per year.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Describe how the original project design will be used including whereadaptation is called for. The need for adaptation should be documentedand the actual adaptation required should be outlined._Identify any partnerships or coalitions that are to be formed to undertakethis demonstration project. The types and amount of participation and commitmentby different groups should be clearly outlined._Describe how the proposed project builds upon the existing service deliverysystem and expands its capabilities, if appropriate._Discuss an evaluation methodology to determine the effectiveness of theproject and to validate the local statistical data used. Time for testingand evaluation must be included in the project design._Describe how the project will continue after Federal funds are exhausted.HDS will give preference to applications which include this information.Background Information: The Administration for Children, Youth and Familiesfunded six projects during Fiscal Year 1986 to ``Improve Shelter StaffCapacity to Deal with Problems of Alcohol Abuse Among Runaway and HomelessYouth.'' These projects developed programs and strategies, materials andstaff training curricula. HDS is interested in applications that will adaptthe models along with the training materials for staff of youth centersor other institutions that serve predominantly Native American youth. Informationon this model can be obtained from: National Resource Center for YouthServices, University of Oklahoma, 131 North Greenwood Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma74120.1.3 Collaborative Training Efforts to Support Children with More SevereHandicaps in Head StartEligibility Criteria: Only Head Start grantees and delegate agencies orUniversity Affiliated Programs (UAPs) for the developmentally disabledmay apply. Applicants must show that this is a collaborative partnershipamong a Head Start grantee, a UAP and a Resource Access Project (RAP) fromproject design through implementation. It is also desirable to show activeparticipation of a Parent and Child Center (PCC) serving infants, toddlersand their parents.Purpose: To increase the capability of Head Start grantees to serve moreseverely handicapped children through collaborative support efforts involvingUAPs and RAPs. These Head Start/UAP/RAP collaborations should include multiethnic,multicultural populations in rural or in urban areas. Products from theproject should include training materials for Head Start staff which willenhance their capacity to serve children with more severe handicaps.Several UAPs currently have relationships with Head Start grantees to providetraining for Head Start staff to increase their capacity to serve handicappedchildren. HDS would consider funding both existing UAP/Head Start collaborationsas well as new collaborations.  The applicant must be willing to work with an independent contractor whichwill be selected at a later date and funded by HDS. The independent contractorwill be responsible for evaluating the funded projects. An integral partof the evaluation will be the collection and analysis of data on costs,services, staffing and training materials.  Duration of projects: Not to exceed 2 years.  Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $50,000 per project per year. Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:  _Describe the combined expertise and resources of the Head Start grantee,the UAP and the RAP to provide training to Head Start teachers, aides,and parents that will enable them to work more effectively with more severelyhandicapped children. Evidence of this collaboration in both project designand implementation must be provided as well as collaboration with a PCCand Protection and Advocacy agency, if appropriate.  _Describe the level of disability of the children to be served.  _Reflect informed family involvement in the development and implementationof the Individual Education Plan for preschoolers and the Individual FamilyService Plan for infants and toddlers.  _Specify collaborative activities with other related public and privateagencies (State Developmental Disabilities Councils, Protection and AdvocacyAgencies, crippled children's services, local disability affiliates oforganizations such as the United Cerebral Palsy or the Association forRetarded Citizens, community mental health centers, local education agencies,etc.). Their levels of involvement must be described and documented.  _Describe how other sources of special assistance or related services forwhich the children or programs are eligible will be located and used, suchas crippled children's services, Medicaid, or third party insurers. Donatedvolunteer assistance should be documented also, as it is a factor in determiningwhich costs must be incurred directly and which can be accessed at no orlittle cost to Head Start. For example, Head Start uses community resourcesand seeks to receive services which other agencies provide prior to expendingHead Start funds.  _Describe the types, numbers and level of disability for each of the childrencurrently being served by the Head Start grantee(s) as well as the targetnumber of children to be enrolled by specific severe handicap.  _Describe the role(s) of the Head Start agency, UAP and RAP in terms ofsupport (financial and in-kind) and training.  _Ensure that services for children with handicapping conditions in theleast restrictive environment should be the goal of the project, includingthe provision of on-site training and intensive follow-up assistance bythe UAP and RAP.  <T3>Background Information:</T3> The 1986 Amendments to the Education ofthe Handicapped Act, Pub. L. 99-457, established additional incentivesto provide services for all children with handicaps below school age by1990-1991. To provide Federal leadership in the implementation of thislaw, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services in theDepartment of Education, ACYF and ADD in HDS, and the Division of Maternaland Child Health (MCH) in the Public Health Service signed a Memorandumof Understanding to mobilize and access national resources for the implementationof Pub. L. 99-457.The agencies signing this Memorandum of Understanding agreed to developand utilize a coordinated interagency approach to sharing information andresources in the areas of regulation, program guidance and priorities;parent participation; identification of handicapped children, materialsand resources; and training and technical assistance. The implementationof these projects by a coalition of Head Start grantees, UAPs, and RAPsshould address all of these areas. MCH will participate with HDS in fundingthe grants to be awarded under this priority area.ACYF's interests in this priority area include Head Start, the PCCs andRAPs. The Head Start program serves children from three to the age of compulsoryschool attendance, 12 percent of whom are handicapped based on nationalstatistics. Approximately 60 percent of these children have speech handicaps.Head Start has a successful history of serving mildly disabled children.This priority area is designed to increase Head Start's capacity to servechildren with more severe handicapping conditions than they are now ableto serve.ACYF also funds PCCs to serve infants and toddlers from birth through agethree with the parent serving as the main intervention agent to fosterthe child's development. To assist Head Start grantees and PCCs in servingchildren with handicaps and their families, ACYF supports a national networkof training and technical assistance providers, the RAPs.Both MCH and ADD support UAPs which provide interdisciplinary trainingfor personnel, demonstrate exemplary services and disseminate findingsand identify future research needs. There are currently 48 UAPs and satellitesfunded by either MCH or ADD or both in 40 States and the District of Columbia.A listing of UAPs and satellites is available from the American Associationof University Affiliated Programs, (301) 588-8252.1.4 Training and Technical Assistance for Family Violence Prevention andServices ProgramsEligibility Criteria: National, multi-State, or State Coalitions or Councilsof State Directors of Family Violence Programs. To the extent possible,applications should include as participants the Directors of Family ViolencePrevention and Services Programs for Indian Tribes located in the State(s)for which application is made.Purpose: To provide training and/or technical assistance on a multi-Statebasis in the conduct of both State and Indian Tribal programs for the preventionand treatment of family violence. In addition to the provision of trainingand technical assistance, an expected outcome is the establishment of anon-going process of coordination and peer assistance among participantsthat will continue after the conclusion of the Federal grant.Duration of projects: Not to exceed one year.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $15,000 per project.HDS plans to fund no more than 5 projects in this priority area with Federalfunding of between $10,000-$15,000 for each project. HDS may give preferenceto those multi-State efforts which were not funded in FY 1988. Informationon these States can be obtained from William Riley at (202) 245-2892. Adirectory of contact persons for Indian Tribal family violence programsis also available from Mr. Riley.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Be responsive to the identified priority needs of the participating Statecoalitions including Indian Tribal family violence programs, if any. Therefore,the application must clearly articulate those needs and show sufficientexpertise to provide the training and technical assistance._Clearly describe the training and technical assistance to be provided,e.g., the exchange of information on model programs, management and operationaltechniques, community relations, fund raising and specialized services.The applications must also describe the methods to be used to accomplishthe training and technical assistance, e.g., the combined use of workshops,the distribution of informational materials and teleconferencing. _To the extent possible, describe how they will utilize the considerableexpertise currently available at the national, State or local levels._Describe their plans for establishing an on-going process of coordinationand peer assistance among the parties involved that will continue afterFederal funding. Background: Programs to prevent and treat family violence have been establishedin all States, typically by local public and nonprofit private organizations(including religious, charitable and voluntary associations). These programsprovide emergency shelter and related assistance to victims of family violenceand their dependents in safe houses or shelters. Adjunct services and treatmentprograms may also be available in the community. These services includecounseling and self help services to victims, dependents, and abusers,and health care services, such as, drug and alcohol abuse treatment.Section 305(b)(3) of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act requiresthat the Department provide training and technical assistance in the conductof programs for the prevention and treatment of family violence. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Administration For Native Americans </ITAG>2.1 Innovative Community Approaches to Entrepreneurial Activity with NativeAmerican Youth Eligibility Criteria: Applicants must be American Indian Tribes, AlaskaNative Villages, Hawaiian Native groups or other Native American organizationsincluding Indian-controlled academic institutions. Purpose: To operate a formal program through which work-related skillsare transmitted in the classroom, through summer activities and/or throughextra-curricular activities geared to business operations. Such projectscan provide for skills acquisition not only for the youth themselves butalso for the community's need for persons with entrepreneurial orientationsand management skills. Projects can include a component addressing theexposure to business opportunities or business activities. Duration of projects: Not to exceed 3 years. Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $200,000 per project forthe total 3-year project period Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should: _Promote entrepreneurship among Native American junior and/or senior highschool students. _Include enterprises that are student operated and that include the expectationof income producing enterprises. These activities may include the developmentof a service needed by the community or the organization, co-ops providingfor the needs of the participants, and/or individual or group-managed businessesfor which markets may be identified. _Include an implementation plan with specific measurable outcomes suchas a decline in the rates of school drop out or increased competency inemployment-related skills among the population identified, to name a fewexamples._Include a budget for each year for which Federal funding is requested._Include and document the collaboration with local resources such as localbanks, Private Industry Councils, colleges, universities, etc. _Describe how it relates to programs in boarding schools, public schoolsor reservation day schools or after school type activities unrelated tothe school setting. Background Information: The Department's 1980 report entitled ``IndianPeople in Indian Lands'' states that the Native American population isyounger than the overall population of the country and that Native Americanshave the highest birth rate. More than one out of three Native Americansis under the age of twenty. Recent studies have pointed out that the lack of entrepreneurial and managementknow-how among the Native American community is a barrier to economic development.Reservation economic development in particular is still in an embryonicstage of development offering tremendous economic potential for the future.Since a large segment of the Native American population is young and willprovide the leadership of tomorrow, an entrepreneurial experience for trainingfuture leaders is critical. Few Native American children have been exposed to entrepreneurial activitythrough their school experience or through community role models. NativeAmerican youth have not had the opportunity to develop entrepreneurialand management skills through traditional avenues. HDS funded 4 projects under this same priority area in 1987 and 3 in 1988because of the continuing concern about the need to develop entrepreneurialskills among young Native Americans as well as the need for a variety ofmodels for replication. Applicants are encouraged to contact Sharon McCully, (202) 245-7776, forinformation concerning specific programmatic issues in this priority area.2.2 Development of Models Applying the Enterprise Zone Concept to NativeAmericans Eligibility Criteria: Eligibility is restricted to Federally-recognizedIndian Tribes, Alaska Native villages as defined in the Alaska Native ClaimsSettlement Act, nonprofit Alaska Native Regional Corporations, Alaska NativeIndian communities as recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and urbanIndian organizations. Purpose: To test the enterprise zone concept of attracting business andinvestment capital to an economically-distressed area primarily throughpackaging and marketing of local resources, governmental attributes andcertain location advantages. Enterprise zones seek to increase employmentin targeted locations by removing tax and regulatory obstacles to business.ANA is interested in addressing the enterprise zone concept in two parts.Section I focuses on Federally recognized Tribes and Section II looks aturban Indian organizations. Alaska Native villages, Alaska Native Indiancommunities and nonprofit Alaska Native Regional Corporations may referto Sections I and II where appropriate. Please refer to Background Informationbelow for a full discussion of Parts I and II. Duration of projects: Not to exceed 3 years. Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $275,000 per project forthe total 3-year project period. Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should: _Address the planning and setting up of an enterprise zone structure andthe implementation of a zone. _Show that the project will be completed or self-sustaining or supportedby other than ANA funds at the end of the project period. _Demonstrate that financing for the enterprise zone will be secured orwill soon be in place at the end of the project period._Include a budget for each year for which Federal funding is requested.Background Information: The concept of enterprise zones as a means of attractingbusiness and capital to Indian reservations is getting increased attention.American Indian Tribes have many of the attributes conducive to enterprisezone application, such as tax immunities, jurisdictional prerogatives,and natural and human resources.HDS funded 5 projects in FY 1987 to test the application of the enterprisezone concept on reservations. These projects are well underway with codedevelopment and the testing and exploration of incentives to attract industry.In FY 1988 the enterprise zone concept was expanded to apply to urban settingsand the Alaska Native community, as well as reservations. Five projectswere funded in FY 1988 and this effort will continue in FY 1989.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section I</ITAG>Tribes, like State governments, have the necessary attributes of sovereigntyto create their own enterprise zones prior to passage of Federal enterprisezone legislation. Tribes also have the option to explore jointly-sponsoredenterprise zones with their State or other local governments.According to a comprehensive 1981 report entitled ``The Applicability ofEnterprise Zones to American Indian Reservations,'' certain principal factorsare important to industry in determining where to locate. Copies of thisstudy may be obtained by writing to the Administration for Native Americans,330 Independence Avenue, SW., Room 5309, North Building, Washington, DC20201 Attention: Sharon McCully.Additional Requirements for Section I: In order to successfully competeunder Section I of this priority area, the application should:_Fully describe the basic economic factors involved in the demonstration(location, labor availability and skills, land, resource availability,market demand and availability of private capital)._Address the degree of civil order within the reservation (personal safety,property security, enforcement of contracts and political stability);_Describe the impact of the reservation's applicable taxes and regulations(Federal, State, Tribal and local);_Describe the reservation's infrastructure/service delivery (transportationaccess, utilities, site preparation, fire protection, schools and streetmaintenance); and,_Describe assistance programs that are available or that will be developed(job training, management assistance services, and grants and low-interestloans)._Include a letter of commitment if the Tribe proposes to engage in a jointlysponsored enterprise zone with another governmental entity. Letters ofcommitment must clearly state the amount of financial or in-kind contributionto be made.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section II</ITAG>For an enterprise zone concept to work effectively for an urban Indiancommunity, that population should be concentrated in a specific area ofthe city. An urban Indian organization must use the enterprise zone toaddress the Indian unemployment problem by: (1) Bringing the job opportunitiesto the community, and (2) assuring strong affirmative action programs gearedto employing Indian people in the businesses attracted to the zone. It must be remembered that ``Indian preference'' in hiring, although legallypracticed in certain Federal agencies and by Tribes on Indian reservations,is generally looked upon as against equal opportunity laws when appliedoutside the reservations and in specific Federal agencies. Therefore, anenterprise zone created to address unemployment problems among an urbanIndian community cannot discriminate against non-Indians seeking employmentinside their zone. Additional Requirements for Section II: In order to successfully competeunder Section II of this priority area, the application should:_Consider creating a special board to handle the enterprise zone programin order to ensure that there is no intra-community factionalism and nopolitical interference between business conducted with the private sectorand municipal governments._Describe how it plans to utilize Federal, State, local and Native Americanresources and programs which are currently available. These include butare not limited to:(1) Targeted assistance programs such as: SCORE, JPTA, ACE; bond issuancefor manufacturing facilities and equipment; tax and regulatory relief incentives,and improved municipal services (trash removal, security, etc.);(2) Local and regional private sector resources (i.e., financial contributionsfor venture capital fund, technical and management assistance, other creativecorporate philanthropy);(3) Federal Government assistance programs, such as: BIA, SBA, EDA andother programs available for technical and financial assistance, minoritypreference in securing contracts; and(4) Resources available through the urban Indian organization such as employmentand training programs, employee counseling and support programs, and creationof venture capital fund (i.e. UIDA's BIDCO fund, the Dakota Fund, etc.)._Include a letter of commitment from their municipal and State governmentsif they are from urban Indian centers. Letters of commitment must clearlystate the amount of financial or in-kind contribution to be made.Applicants are encouraged to contact Sharon McCully, (202) 245-7776, forinformation concerning specific programmatic issues in this priority area.2.3 Resolving Alcohol and Substance Abuse within Native American CommunitiesEligibility Criteria: American Indian Tribes, Alaska Native villages, Hawaiiangroups and other Native American organizations.Purpose: To address the reduction or prevention of alcohol and substanceabuse through innovative prevention projects. Demonstrations should showpositive measurable outcomes in preventing or reducing alcohol and substanceabuse. ANA hopes that projects will build on traditional Indian valuesand practices. Duration of projects: Not to exceed 3 years.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $160,000 per project forthe total 3-year project period.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_To the extent possible, present a comprehensive prevention approach involvingthe family and the entire community. Or applicants may focus on a particularsegment within the family or community, such as the workplace or school._State how the application relates to or could relate to their Tribal ActionPlan (TAP) if applicant is an Indian Tribe or Alaska Native village. Theapplication, however, cannot duplicate an existing funded element of theTAP or propose to develop or coordinate the TAP._Describe cooperative efforts including general public and private agenciesand/or organizations_To the extent possible, have a cultural approach focusing on traditionalNative American practices._Include a budget for each year for which Federal funding is requested._<T3>Not </T3>provide for on-going social service delivery, expansion orcontinuation of existing social service delivery programs, or direct services.Background Information: Widespread problems associated with alcohol andsubstance abuse among the Native American population have been documentedby various studies/reports through the Indian Health Service and the Bureauof Indian Affairs. The costs of alcohol and substance abuse measured interms of physical, mental, social and economic indices have been enormousto Native Americans.Historically, the health status of Native Americans has been substantiallybelow that of the U.S. population especially in terms of alcohol and alcohol-relatedhealth problems. Indians die from alcoholism at over four times the age-adjustedrates for the U.S. population. Misuse of alcohol and substance abuse resultin a rate of years of potential life lost nearly five times that of thegeneral U.S. population. Four of the top ten causes of death among Indiansare alcohol and drug related injuries (18 percent of all deaths), chronicliver disease and cirrhosis (5 percent), suicide (3 percent), and homicide(3 percent).Alcohol and substance abuse is especially hazardous to Indian youth. Indiansbetween the ages of 15 and 24 are more than two times as likely to commitsuicide as the general population and approximately 80 percent of thosesuicides are alcohol-related. Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 aretwice as likely as the general population to die in automobile accidents,75 percent of which are alcohol-related.Alcohol abuse affects and is associated with not only the abuser, but alsothe abuser's family. In most Native American communities family is definedas the extended family_parents, their children, grandparents, aunts, uncles,etc. It also affects and is associated with the abuser's friends and peers,therefore impacting on the condition of the workplace and the school environment.Therefore a comprehensive approach is needed. Community support throughpublic awareness as one means might prove useful in the problem solvingprocess.Another useful factor is incorporating traditionally held Indian valuesin reducing the use of alcohol and other substances. A 1980 study by E.R.Oetting, et al., found that Native American youth who did not use drugsor alcohol consistently came from homes that had strong family sanctionsagainst substance abuse. These families were perceived as being more successfulin the ``Indian way.'' A 1985 study of 2,000 Native American youth ages11 to 18, conducted by Velma Mason, showed that youth who did not use drugsor alcohol exhibited a high degree of family-oriented identity and perceivedtheir families as maintaining traditional values. The reverse was foundfor Indian youth who reported drug or alcohol involvement.HDS funded 5 prevention projects in FY 1987 and 4 in 1988 under this samepriority area. Applicants are encouraged to contact Sharon McCully, (202)245-7776, for information concerning specific programmatic issues in thispriority area.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Administrative on Developmental Disabilities </ITAG>On April 21, 1988, a notice soliciting comments on ADD's proposed priorityareas for Fiscal Year 1989 Projects of National Significance was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. A 60-day period was required to allow the publicto comment on the proposed areas. After review and analysis of these comments,ADD published its final priorities. ADD received 31 letters and a total of 44 specific comments from nationaland local human service organizations, advocacy groups, educators, representativesfrom State and local government offices, and private citizens. The commentsreceived were helpful in highlighting the concerns of the developmentaldisabilities field and have been extensively used in refining the finalpriority areas. The comments received were also the basis for excluding the following priorityareas from the final solicitation: Personnel Shortages, Integrated ChildDevelopment and Educational Environment, and Substance Abuse. The Ongoing Data Collection System Priority Area was included in the FiscalYear 1988 Projects of National Significance announcement. A grantee hasbeen selected and is scheduled for two year funding. This priority area,therefore, is not included in this announcement. 3.1 Early Intervention Eligibility Criteria: State, public or private nonprofit organizations,institutions or agencies. <T3>Purpose:</T3> To develop tools and procedures to enable the analysisand assessment of the adequacy of existing State policies and practiceson early intervention; and to develop models of interdisciplinary trainingand multi-organizational involvement (Head Start, University AffiliatedPrograms, and Maternal and Child Health centers) needed to ensure measurableprogress in ameliorating the effects of developmental disabilities throughearly intervention. This information is needed by policymakers who may make decisions on criticalissues pertaining to early intervention. Policymakers include individualsin decision-making positions in business, local/State government, associations,and community organizations. Duration of Projects: Not to exceed 12 months. Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $100,000 per project. Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should: _<T3>For Postnatal</T3>_explore and document the effect of neonatal andpostnatal prevention opportunities on reducing the incidence of developmentaldisabilities. Within this area, the following themes may be selected forstudy: (1) Projects which will provide screening for early identification andreferral of newborns and infants who are at-risk due to biological or environmentalfactors. Such risks can contribute to unfulfilled parental responsibilitieswhich may increase the incidence of developmental disabilities; and (2) Projects designed to reduce and prevent child abuse and neglect whichcontributes to the incidence of developmental disabilities. _<T3>For Education/Public Awareness</T3>_provide education and informationfor public and professional audiences regarding available early interventionactivities related to genetic, environmental, and other factors relatedto the well-being of individuals with developmental disabilities. Suchactivities may include the use of maternal transport of Neonatal IntensiveCare Units, the value of early intervention, the use of teratogen registries,and the role of community nursing. <T3>Background Information: </T3>Developmental disabilities are chroniclife long conditions which cause significant functional impairment in severalareas of life activity. Developmental disabilities can have great impactupon the lives of many individuals and families. The tragedy of developmentaldisabilities is that a highly significant percentage of these impairmentsare caused by factors which are preventable through early intervention.HDS encourages collaboration among agencies at the State and local levelin this priority area. 3.2 Family Support PracticesEligibility Criteria: State, public or private nonprofit organizations,institutions or agencies.Purpose: To assist policymakers to resolve specific barriers to the deliveryof home-based care, such as third party insurance payments, home-healthcare practices, funding mechanisms, and other relevant barriers withoutdisrupting the important involvement or informal, natural sources of familysupport; and to promote cost effectiveness and quality in the provisionof family support service and activities. Policymakers include individualsin decision-making positions in business, local/State government, associations,and community organizations.Duration of Projects: Not to exceed 12 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $100,000 per project.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Contain a specific focus on the resolution of barriers to home-based carein insurance practices and home-health care standards._Outline an effective process for evaluating and synthesizing the availableinformation on this issue._Include as an outcome the development of a guide which can be used bypolicymakers and program developers to select successful models or componentsof models which would be appropriate for replication within their jurisdictions._Provide evidence of collaboration with human service and/or private sectororganizations.Background Information: The projects sited below are among numerous effortsat the local, State and national level which have focused on the familysupport isssue. Following are examples of projects which ADD has fundedin the past several years:andbullet; ``PRO Family Support Project'', New Mexico Parents Reaching Out(PRO), in 1986-1988.andbullet; ``Community-Based Respite Care Project for Families ProvidingCare to Developmentally Disabled Children at Home,'' Maine Department ofMental Health and Mental Retardation, in 1985-1988.andbullet; ``Life Service Plans for the Elderly and the Developmentally Disabled_Nationaland Local Self-Help Models,'' American Bar Association, in 1985-1987.Additional information about these projects may be obtained by contactingRay Sanchez, ADD, at (202) 2456-1961.3.3 Technical Assistance Projects to Assist State Planning Councils, UniversityAffiliated Programs (UAP), and the State Protection and Advocacy System(Pandamp;A)Eligibility Criteria: State, public or private nonprofit organizations,institutions or agencies.Purpose: To expand or improve:andbullet; The advocacy functions of the State Planning Council;andbullet; The functions performed by University Affiliated Programs andSatellite Centers; andandbullet; The protection and advocacy services relating to the State protectionand advocacy system.This includes arranging for and coordinating the provision of technicalassistance to UAPs, PAs and State Developmental Disabilities Planning Councilson program development, planning and policy analysis across developmentaldisabilities agencies and programs.ADD expects to fund one project in each of the categories identified above.Duration of Projects: Not to exceed 12 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $100,000 per project.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Demonstrate the ability to expand or otherwise improve either the advocacyfunctions of the State Planning Council; or the functions performed byUAPs and Satelitte Centers; or the protection and advocacy services relatingto the State Pandamp;A system._Provide evidence of partnerships with community agencies and local advocacyagencies to emphasize productivity, independence, and integration intothe community of individuals with developmental disabilities.Background Information: Section 162(a)(2) of the Developmental Disabilitiesand Bill of Rights Act of 1987 provides that the Secretary may make grantsand enter into contracts with public or nonprofit private agencies fortechnical assistance or demonstration projects which hold the promise toexpand or improve State Planning Councils, UAPs, and State Pandamp;As.3.4 Community IntegrationEligibility Criteria: State, public or private nonprofit organizations,institutions or agencies.Purpose: To identify, evaluate and synthesize community-based models ofsuccessful social integration which have brought about the acceptance ofpersons with developmental disabilities as neighbors and friends; and toidentify models which were successful with other target populations thatcould be adapted for use with persons with developmental disabilities.Duration of Projects: Not to exceed 12 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $100,000 per project.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Indicate how the project would build upon or depart from current state-of-the-artpractices._Contain an evaluation plan focusing on the project products, includinga plan of dissemination and utilization of project findings.Background Information: Further development, enhancement and disseminationof successful models of community integration are needed to support personswith developmental disabilities so they can live and be accepted in theneighborhoods in which they live.HDS is particularly interested in examining successful models serving othertarget populations which can be replicated to serve the developmentallydisabled. These models could include: community residential programs, programssupporting employment within the community and other generic social integrationprograms, such senior nutrition/multi-service centers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Administration for Children, Youth and Families</ITAG>4.1 Adoptive Parent Groups_Partners in the Adoption of Special Needs ChildrenEligibility Criteria: Eligibility is limited to voluntary or public socialservice agencies, adoption exchanges or other national, regional or Statewideadoption related organizations.Purpose: To continue support for the development of new or involvementof existing adoptive parent groups and to utilize them in the adoptionprocess for children with special needs.Duration of Projects: Not to exceed 17 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $75,000 per project.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Establish that the organization has Statewide, regional (i.e., inter-state)or national membership to assist local or State adoptive parent groupsto work with child welfare agencies. These adoptive parent groups willbe responsible for activities which may include, but are not limited to:Adoptive information and referral services, recruitment and orientationfor prospective adoptive parents, and support to families following placementand legalization. Of particular interest will be their ability to supportand develop minority adoptive family groups._Include the rationale for choosing to work with existing adoptive parentgroups, or developing new adoptive parent groups, which will focus on problemsor issues of importance to special needs adoption._Establish procedures and criteria for the award of subgrants to incorporatednonprofit local or State adoptive parent groups, and for working with newlyformed groups, to assist them in incorporating. Subgrants may be awardedto groups only once they are incorporated and may not exceed $5,000.Background: Through the years, adoptive parents have continued to promoteand support the adoption of children with special needs. They have beeneffective advocates for children and have challenged the term ``unadoptable''by demonstrating that children with special needs can be placed with afamily of their own. The 600 adoptive parent organizations are comprisedof volunteers and have limited funds to develop their interests on behalfof children with special needs. Support for these groups is important asthey historically have been productive and successful in the activitiesthey pursue. They bring to the adoption field the perspective of consumersof services, and, are on the cutting edge between the children to be servedand the agencies that serve them. Adoptive parent groups and social serviceagencies have worked together to assist and provide support to new adoptivefamilies to integrate these special needs children into their families.4.2 Special Needs Adoption Services and the Mental Health SystemEligibility Criteria: Public adoption and mental health agencies as wellas private nonprofit adoption or mental health agencies are encouragedto apply. Consortia of private and public agencies that demonstrate collaborativeplanning and joint commitment of resources, including personnel, are encouraged.Emphasis should be placed on involvement of existing community mental healthfacilities.Purpose: To support collaborative efforts between adoption agencies andcommunity mental health services for the development or expansion of treatmentskills and resources for special needs children and families in adoption.These services and resources should address issues that occur prior toadoption, during placement and after legalization.Duration of Projects: Not to exceed 24 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $125,000 per project peryear.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should: _Provide for a process to achieve inter-agency coordination and improvedmental health services to the adoption community from a child's preparationfor adoption through placement, legalization and post adoption. _Describe methods to be used for coordinated planning, resource developmentand systems intergration that will provide a continuum of home and communitybased services to assist the child to be adopted, the prospective adoptivefamily and the adopted child in this family. _Describe methods to document whether goals and objectives have been metand to assess the effectiveness of the project. _Provide written assurances from the collaborating agencies of intent toparticipate in the project. Background: Children in the child welfare system for whom adoption is thegoal and their prospective adoptive families, as well as children now inadoption and their families, often need access to the skills and expertiseof mental health services in addition to child welfare services. This isespecially true with children who are older and have other special needsare being or have been adopted. Because the professional mental healthservice provider is often not aware of the special issues related to theadoption experience, special efforts must be made to expand existing treatmentskills to fully serve this group. Types of mental health problems related to adoption are not unique, butthese clients exist in a family environment that is different from othermental health clients. For example, the issues of loss, separation andattachment are part of the adoption experience and must be viewed in thatcontext. The development of appropriate services to meet the needs of thesechildren and their families is necessary. Information on special needs adoption projects can be obtained from: NationalResource Center for Special Needs Adoption, Spaulding for Children, 366Waltrous Road, P.O. Box 337, Chelsea, Michigan 48118, (313) 475-8693.4.3 Collaboration among Adoption, Mental Health and Developmental DisabilitiesService Systems Eligibility Criteria: Agencies administering any of the three public programs(Child Welfare (CW), Mental Health (MH) or Developmental Disabilities (DD))at the State, regional or local level with written commitment from theother two agencies can apply. Purpose: To promote systems change which provide for increasing collaborationamong the three programs identified above as related to the adoption ofspecial needs children with developmental disabilities. Duration of projects: Not to exceed 24 months. Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $75,000 per project per year.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Describe the development and institutionalization of a three-way collaborativemodel on either a State-wide, regional (intra-State) or local basis. _Provide clear and specific written commitments to the collaborative effortfrom the two agencies which are not the lead agency. _Provide for complete development of a collaborative model suitable fordissemination and replication in other locations. Background: Adoption services have changed dramatically over the past twodecades as children with special needs from a variety of settings are consideredfor and placed with permanent families. Traditionally, all children foradoption were served in the child welfare system, but in the past few yearthere has been real movement in considering children in mental health anddevelopmental disabilities facilities for permanent family life. For childrenwith developmental disabilities who cannot remain with nor return to theirbirth parents, regardless of which system (CW, MH, or DD) has responsibility,adoption is a viable option. Although there are exemplary models of cooperation between CW and MH andCW and DD, there has been very little done in the way of establishing athree-way collaborative model. Even in States with an ``umbrella agency,''where CW, DD and MH are part of the same State-wide department, there areno established cooperative procedures for children with developmental disabilitiesin need of adoption. In States with separate departments, there is evengreater need to develop such procedures.Information on special needs adoption projects can be obtained from: NationalResource Center for Special Needs Adoption, Spaulding for Children, 366Waltrous Road, P.O. Box 337, Chelsea, Michigan 48118, (313) 475-8693.<ITAG tagnum="81">Child Welfare Training</ITAG>Eligibility Criteria: For Traineeships, In-Service Training and Collaborationamong Agencies, applicants must be institutions of higher education whichare accredited by the Council of Social Work Education and which trainbachelors or masters level students in social work. Training <T3>must be</T3> for candidates for bachelors or masters degress in socialwork. For Indian Child Welfare Training, applicants must be two and fouryear colleges controlled by Tribes or serving reservations and accreditedby the appropriate accrediting authorities. For Historically Black Collegesand Universities (HBCUs), applicants must qualify under Executive Order12320. Generally institutions qualify as HBCUs, if they were establishedbefore 1964 with their principal mission having been and continuing tobe the education of Black Americans.Institutions may apply for traineeship grants and one other type of grant(either collaboration or in-service.) Institutions may not apply for bothin-service and collaboration.Purpose: To ensure the availability of adequately trained and skilled stafffor public child welfare services. These priority areas promote effectivecollaboration between schools of social work and public child welfare agencies,and expand the number of professionally trained and qualified individualswho manage and provide services in the public child welfare system.Duration of projects: See specific priority area.Federal Share of Project Costs: See specific priority area.Background: As the child welfare field is increasingly involved with anolder, and more difficult to serve population of children and their families,it is critical that public child welfare staff are adequately trained andskilled. Yet the most recently available data indicate that the vast majorityof individuals who are employed in public child welfare lack the professionalpreparation which would equip them to perform this demanding work.The social work profession has historically taken a lead role in the professionalpreparation of child welfare workers. However, as the field and the professionhave evolved, fewer graduates of social work programs have taken positionsin public agencies and some agencies have either been unable to find qualifiedpersons to fill positions or have declassified positions and hired individualswith no professional credentials. The combination of these and other factorshas created a critical problem in child welfare service delivery.Applications are sought in five priority areas: (4.4.A) traineeships forstudents pursuing degrees in social work or child welfare; (4.4.B) in-servicetraining for persons employed in the field of child welfare; (4.4.C) specialgrants for Indians; (4.4.D) special grants for HBCUs; and (4.4.E) demonstrationprojects which involve collaborative efforts between schools of socialwork and public child welfare agencies.Dissemination is not appropriate to these priority areas. Therefore, applicationnarratives should respond to the following sections:(a) Need for the Project (20 points/5 pages).(b) Project Methodology (30 points/7.5 pages).(c) Expected Outcomes (30 points/7.5 pages).(d) Level of Effort (20 points/5 pages).Only these four criteria will be used to evaluate applications under theseChild Welfare Training priority areas.4.4.A. TraineeshipsTraineeship grants will provide financial support for the education andprofessional training of students pursuing undergraduate or graduate socialwork degrees or graduate degrees in child welfare who have a stated interestin practice in public child welfare after graduation. Traineeships areintended to support the education of professionals who will assume leadershippositions in the field of public child welfare. All traineeships must includea field placement component that provides the student with direct experiencein a child welfare related setting, preferably in the public sector. HDSis especially interested in applications for traineeships for minoritystudents. Applicants are encouraged to seek cooperative agreements with public childwelfare agencies in order to provide traineeships to public agency employeeswho demonstrate potential for leadership in child welfare and who wishto return to school to obtain an undergraduate or graduate level degreein social work and have indicated a desire to remain in public child welfarefor a peroid of time at least equal to the period of the traineeship. Applications should describe the curriculum utilized and how it relatesto the needs of child welfare practitioners. Applicants must specify thenumber of students to receive traineeships. Traineeships grants may only be used for student financial support andnot for any other direct or indirect costs for the applicant institution.Applicants should include the cost of an annual grantees meeting, to beheld in Washington, DC, in their budgets. Traineeship grants will be awarded for up to 24 months, for stipends witha maximum of $5,000 per student not to exceed a total of $25,000 per yearper institution. No matching funds are required for traineeships. Institutionshaving current Child Welfare Traineeship grants which will continue beyondSeptember 30, 1989, are not eligible to apply under this priority area.4.4.B. In-Service Training In-Service training grants will support training for personnel employedin public/Tribal child welfare agencies. Topics for training should addressspecific high priority training needs identified by the public/Tribal agencyand may focus on any level of personnel, including front line workers,supervisors or administrators. HDS is especially interested in leadershiptraining for persons in management and senior supervisory positions andfor other agency employees who demonstrate potential for leadership inthe child welfare field and have indicated a desire to remain in publicchild welfare for a period of time at least equal to the period of in-servicetraining. The training program should be described in detail and include specificmeasurable outcomes and a plan for evaluation of effectiveness. Applicantsmust demonstrate and document that Indian Tribal or State child welfareagencies have actively participated in the selection of training topicsand in the planning and implementation of the project.

Collaboration Between Schools of Social Work and Child Welfare AgenciesGrants will be awarded in this priority area to support special projectsof national significance from institutions of higher education that demonstratecreative, innovative, organizationally sound and economically feasiblemethods of facilitate continuing interaction between schools of socialwork and public child welfare agencies in order to promote child welfaretraining objectives. These collaborative efforts may also include professionalassociations with significant involvement in public child welfare. Theonly eligible applicant, however, is the school of social work. HDS encouragesformulation of projects which ensure full input and participation of bothparties in the collaborative effort; which maximize the role of publicchild welfare agencies in pursuit of child welfare training objectives;and which ultimately improve the level of child welfare services in thecountry. Letters of commitment, not support, must be included with theapplication.Some examples are:(a) Demonstration of a model to share or exchange staff and faculty inorder to enrich teaching and promote improvement in the quality of agencyservices;(b) Efforts to promote the upgrading of State and/or local merit systemprocedures for classifying professional social work positions;(c) Efforts to improve the extent to which interdisciplinary services areprovided to child welfare clients;(d) Development of uniform certification standards for child welfare workers;(e) Definition of competencies for supervisors in child welfare practice,including child protective services; and(f) Development and implementation of strategies to recruit and train individualswith the characteristics, motivation and ability to become supervisorsand administrators in child welfare agencies.These examples are meant to be illustrative only and HDS encourages thefield to generate additional concepts.Projects which are primarily in-service training or traineeships will notbe funded under this priority area.

Suits against law enforcement agencies haveleft many with judgments for damages due to actions of its officers. Suitsagainst caseworkers in the child welfare and child protection agencieshave also been taken to court. Suits may be brought for not removing achild who should have been, for removing a child who should not have been,or for doing nothing. Liability insurance costs for social service agencieshave caused some localities to resort to self-insurance. All of these issuescan have an impact on the behavior of social service personnel, on theability to recruit professionals, on the costs of liability and malpracticeinsurance and on the quality control and decision making structures ofpublic agencies.4.6 Collaborative Effort to Establish Development Child Care for Childrenin Homeless FamiliesEligibility Criteria: Head Start grantees, child protective services agencies,public or nonprofit child care agencies, and other community service agenciesPurpose: To develop and provide developmental child care to homeless childrenfrom age one through the age for mandatory entry into public school whoare residing with their families in welfare hotels, homeless shelters,or other temporary shelters for homeless families. These children havevery limited opportunity for developmental experiences due to the environmentaland social restrictions inherent in these living arrangements. The leadcoordinating agency must be able to coordinate the agencies so that a packageof full day developmental child care services is available for all childrenin the family below mandatory school age regardless of the number, agesor special needs. The full day services are necessary not only to providethe physical and social space for optimum development, but also to provideparents with respite time to seek or train for employment and attend toother personal needs. Projects funded under this priority area can helpto find ways to ensure the availability of a wide range of services forthese homeless children.Duration of Projects: Not to exceed 24 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $100,000 per project peryear.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Provide for a collaborative arrangement which includes the public agencyresponsible for the families, the child protective services agency, HeadStart, a Parent and Child Center (PCC) or a developmental child care programfor special needs children, as appropriate, to establish a full day programwith parental involvement to meet the physical, social, emotional and educationaldevelopment needs of these children. Letters of commitment, not of support,must be included._Describe how the child care programs will enhance the child's development._Provide for adequate liaison through the homeless program to continuework with children when/if the family is moved from shelter to shelter.The provision of follow-up services, when they leave the shelter for apermanent home (especially in the identification of other child developmentarrangements for preschool children) must be addressed in the application._Explain how maximum use will be made of existing community services, utilizingcommunity donated services, such as volunteers for transportation or workingwith children, etc. All involved groups must provide a letter of commitment._Provide for an evaluation component which will clearly assess the effectivenessof the developmental child care project.Background: The effects of poverty on children's development is well documented.The lack of a permanent home, the restricted environment of alternativeshelters and the inability to count on the stability of services in thesame community add additional stress. Because of the inherent mobilityin the situation, these children and families often ``fall through thecracks'' for services that benefit low-income families with a permanentaddress.4.7 Adaptation of Early Childhood State-of-the-Art Methods, Models andCurricula in a Head Start Setting Eligibility Criteria: Institutions of higher education, research and trainingorganizations or other organizations which have existing program models,materials or curricula ready for demonstration in Head Start in one ofthe following areas: (1) Curricula including materials, in areas such as science or math ora developmental area such as problem solving or logical thinking;(2) Materials, models or methods for parent/child interaction or familydynamics;(3) Materials, models or methods to assist staff in assessing preschoolchildren;(4) Materials, methods or demonstrations focusing on leadership developmentor training for preschool staff; or (5) New models or materials for child or program assessment. These models, methods or materials shall either be new to Head Start orhave had limited prior use in Head Start programs. Purpose: To provide the field of child development with new ideas and methodsfor enhancing child, parent and staff development, and for keeping HeadStart grantees current with new ideas, methods and technology in the fieldof child development and early childhood education. Duration of Project: Not to exceed 24 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $150,000 per year per project.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should: _Include signed consent from one or more Head Start programs in which theapplicant can mount the demonstration. _Include a strong justification if the entire demonstration will not becarried out at Head Start site(s). _Provide a justification for how their project would improve the portionof the Head Start program on which it is targeted, how it will benefitHead Start children, parents and staff, and how it will contribute to thechild development field. _Include in the methodology sufficient specificity on the numbers of classrooms,children, parents, or staff participating so that judgments can be madeabout the potential to generalize the applicability of the models, materialsor technologies to other child development settings. Background: With the growing interest in the provision of preschool experiencesfor all children and especially low-income children, Head Start's roleas a model child development program becomes increasingly important. Therefore,as new knowledge, technologies and theories develop and are accepted byprofessionals in early childhood development, their introduction into HeadStart is important to the field as well as to the maintenance of Head Start'srole as a leader and model in the field of child development. It is alsocritical in providing Head Start children and their families with the bestservices possible based on state-of-the-art thinking and technologies.For the past several years Head Start has been funding innovative ideaswhich have been generated by Head Start programs, a grass roots approach.This was done in order to infuse Head Start with new programmatic possibilitiesand options. While this effort has generated a number of stimulating innovations,it has precluded the infusion of new innovations from the child developmentfield at-large and particularly those institutions engaged in state-of-the-artchild development research. During the final year of the project, each project may be evaluated todetermine the general applicability of the model, material or technology.Those projects which seem to have potential for general applicability maybe supplemented to test its transferability during a third year. 4.8 Development and Testing of Integrated Treatment for Dysfunctional Familiesof At-Risk Youth by Runaway and Homeless Youth CentersEligibility Criteria: Applicants must be runaway and homeless youth sheltersthat are currently funded under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act or wouldqualify under the Act's program requirements.Purpose: To develop and test model programs of treatment for dysfunctionalfamilies that enable the family to remain as the primary care giver andstill protect the interests and well being of at-risk youth.Duration of Projects: Not to exceed 36 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $100,000 per project peryear.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should:_Emphasize development of integrated services program design which supportsfamilies in their role as primary caregiver. The applicant must demonstratethe ability to put into place a treatment program that covers three majorservice components:andbullet; In-home treatment_intensive intervention;andbullet; Treatment services while the youth is out of the home; andandbullet; Outpatient services that are accessible._Have all three service capabilities or have agreement(s) with appropriateservice providers to provide missing components(s). Documentation of theagreement(s) should be included with the application._Provide for a third party evaluation of the impacts of the treatment components.The evaluation design should include some common measures to provide pre-and post-treatment assessments of family dysfunction. The specific commonmeasures to be used in the evaluation will be agreed upon at a projectbriefing at the outset of the project period.Background Information: One of the major causes of runaway behavior andhomelessness among youth is dysfunctional family situations. Family treatmentprograms can be successful to the extent of helping families remain theprimary care giver of their children. While integrated treatment may notdispel deeply rooted dysfunction, it can assist in developing a level ofmaintenance that permits the family to remain as the primary care giverfor the youth. Successful programs, however, need to be integrated in theirefforts. HDS is interested in the development of model integrated treatmentprograms for use by runaway and homeless youth shelters in working withat-risk youth and their families.4.9 Transitioning Homeless Youth from Emergency Homeless Center to IndependentLiving Programs and Self-SufficiencyEligibility Criteria: Partnership projects between Federally-funded CommunityAction Agencies and Runaway and Homeless Youth Center. Applications thatdo not include partnership arrangements with Runaway and Homeless YouthCenters are ineligible and will not be reviewed. Letters of commitment,not support, for the partner agency which is not the lead agency shouldbe included with the application.Purpose: To stimulate self-sufficiency by developing and testing new modelsfor working with homeless, older, at-risk adolescents which: (1) Integrateemergency services and (2) coordinate social service efforts that improveindependent living and self-sufficiency skills.Duration of projects: Not to exceed 36 months.Federal Share of Project Costs: Not to exceed $60,000 per project per year.Minimum Requirements for Project Design: In order to successfully competeunder this priority area, the application should: _Identify Federal, State and local impediments to the development and implementationof independent living/self-sufficiency models and describe the processto be used to overcome them in developing a comprehensive community wideplanning process that will become institutionalized. _Build on the knowledge gained from ACYF funded demonstrations and recentstudies. Information on such studies is available through the NationalReources Center for Youth Services, operated by the University of Oklahoma,131 North Greenwood Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74120. _Include an evaluation component which must be conducted by an independentevaluator. Background Information: The challenge to applicants for funds under thispriority area is to develop and test new models that deal with the rangeof problems encountered by homeless adolescents receiving emergency shelterservices when they attempt to live independently. One problem to overcomeis the lack of a comprehensive support system covering the full periodof time needed by adolescents to develop the skills necessary to achieveself-sufficiency. Most often, existing systems are not part of an integratednetwork that combines emergency services for the homeless and longer rangeplanning for independent living and self-sufficiency. Whatever specificproblem or combination of problems the applicant chooses to address, theapplicant will be expected to propose solutions that eliminate the ``networkingof services'' problems which cause youth to remain in emergency serviceor temporary placement situations for protracted periods of time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part III_General Information and Guidelines for the Application Processand Review </ITAG>This part contains general information for potential applicants and basicguidelines for submitting applications in response to this announcement.Application forms are provided along with detailed instructions for developingand assembling the application package for submittal. Specific guidelineson applicant eligibility and grantee matching requirements are providedin Part II under each priority area.A. General Information<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Review Process and Funding Decisions </ITAG>Applications that conform to the requirements of this program announcementwill be reviewed and scored competitively against the published evaluationcriteria by experts in the field, generally persons from outside of theFederal Government. The results of this review are a primary factor inmaking funding decisions.HDS reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring themto, other Federal or non-Federal funding sources when this is determinedto be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant.HDS also solicits comments from other Federal Departments, from Centraland Regional Office staff, from interested foundations, national organizations,specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments willbe considered by the Assistant Secretary for Human Development Servicesand the HDS Senior Staff in making funding decisions.Preference may be given to applications which focus on or feature: Minoritypopulations; a substantial innovation that has the potential to improvetheory or practice in the field of human services; a model practice orset of procedures that hold the potential for dissemination to, and utilizationby, organizations involved in the administration or delivery of human services;substantial involvement of volunteers; substantial involvement (eitherfinancial or programmatic) of the private sector; a favorable balance betweenFederal and non-Federal funds available for the proposed project; the possibilityof a large degree of benefit for a small Federal investment; a programmaticfocus on those most in need; and substantial involvement in the proposedproject by national or community foundations.To the extent possible, final decisions will reflect the equitable distributionof assistance among the States, geographical areas of the nation, ruraland urban areas, and ethnic populations. HDS Senior Staff also take intoaccount the need to avoid wasteful duplication of effort in making fundingdecisions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Required Notification of State Single Point of Contact</ITAG>It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials to theSingle Point of Contact (SPOC) and indicate the date of this submittal(or date of contact if no submittal is required) on the SF 424, item 22a.SPOCs will be notified of any applicant not indicating SPOC contact onthe application, when SPOC contact is required. SPOCs have sixty (60) daysstarting from the application deadline to comment on applications for financialassistance under this program. Comments are, therefore, due no later thanJanuary 10, 1989. This process is required when the program is coveredunder Executive Order 12372 ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs''and 45 CFR Part 100 ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Healthand Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under the Order, States maydesign their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federalassistance under covered programs.All States and territories, except Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska,American Samoa and Palau, have elected to participate in the ExecutiveOrder process and have established SPOCs. Applicants from these seven areasneed take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applications for projects tobe administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt fromthe requirements of E.O. 12372.SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsementsas official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to differentiateclearly between mere advisory comments and those official State processrecommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain''rule. It is helpful in tracking SPOC comments if the SPOC will clearlyindicate the applicant organization as it appears on the application SF424. When comments are submitted directly to HDS, they should be addressedto the application mailing address in Part I.A list of the State Single Points of Contact is included at the end ofthis announcement.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Notification of State Developmental Disabilities Councils</ITAG>A copy of the application must be submitted to the State DevelopmentalDisabilities Council for its review and comment when individuals with developmentaldisabilities who reside in that State are included among the target populationsof the proposed project. A listing of the Councils may be obtained by calling(202) 755-4560. This requirement is in addition to the SPOC notificationrequired by Executive Order 12372.B. Deadline for Submittal of ApplicationsThe closing date for submittal of applications under this program announcementis November 10, 1988. Applications must be either mailed or hand-deliveredto the address in Part I of this announcement.Hand-delivered applications are accepted during the normal working hoursof 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.
