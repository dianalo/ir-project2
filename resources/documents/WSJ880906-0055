The building materials and forest products concern said the project will include a new furnace at a site that it didn't identify and expansion of its Etowa, Tenn., facility.    Sales of fiber glass, which is used in the automotive, marine and construction industries, account for about 40% of Manville's $2.06 billion in annual revenue.    The company said the expansion must be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge. Manville six years ago sought protection from creditors' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in the face of a flood of asbestos-related lawsuits. </TEXT></DOC>
