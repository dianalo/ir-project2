Reactor balance analysis is made and problems still to solveto satisfy Lawson criterion are presented. Two ways are studied: themagnetic and the inertial confinement. Current technology in both casesis reviewed: mirror machines, toroidal machines, power lasers, theircharacteristics and their maximal power. Particle beams are seen. Performancebalances of the main machines are sketched.</TEXT></DOC>
