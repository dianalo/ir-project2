KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress celebrated its bicentennial onThursday with trumpets, with poetry and, reflecting the nature ofthe place, with speeches galore.   The House of Representatives and the Senate of the United Statesgathered for a joint meeting in the House chamber for a ceremonycalling attention to that late-winter day in 1789 when Congressassembled for the first time in New York City, eventually to breathelife into the newly ratified Constitution.   Actually, Thursday's session took place two days before theanniversary. The 1st Congress met on March 4, 1789. But the actualanniversary falls on a Saturday, and the 101st Congress will not bein session that day.   At the bicentennial celebration, the mood was both serious andirreverent.   ``Since reverence has never been America's thing, this verse inyour honor will not begin, `O Thou,''' said Howard Nemerov, poetlaureate of the United States, reading a poem dedicated to Congressas it begins its third century.   Even some of the words about Congress quoted in the printedprogram had an irreverent air:   _``Congress is so strange. A man gets up to speak and saysnothing. Nobody listens _ and then everbody disagrees.'' _ BorisMarshalov, a Soviet visitor in 1946.   _``We cuss Congress, and we joke about 'em, but they are all goodfellows at heart _ and if they wasn't in Congress, why, they wouldbe doing something else against us that might be even worse.'' _Will Rogers.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that in theage of television, the presidency is perceived by most Americans asthe primary branch of government.   ``I do not claim that Congress is the primary branch ofgovernment,'' Mitchell said. ``I do remind all it is a coequalbranch.''   David McCullough, a prize-winning historian, gave the principaladdress, and sounded the same theme.   In contrast to the presidency, he said, ``Congress seems to rollon like a river. Someone said you can never cross the same rivertwice. Congress is like that _ always there and always changing.   ``Individuals come and go. The stage is constantly crowded. Thetalk and the rumpus go on. And there has been a lot of humbug and somuch that is overwhelmingly boring.''   McCollough added: ``Congress for all its faults has not been theunbroken parade of clowns and thieves and posturing windbags sooften portrayed. ... What should be spoken of more often are thegreat victories that have been won here, the decisions of courageand vision achieved, the men and women of purpose and integrity,and, yes, at time genius, who have served here.''   The first Congress adopted the Bill of Rights _ the first 10amendments to the Constitution; established the Supreme Court andother divisions of the federal court system; counted the firstelectoral ballots that seated George Washington as the firstpresident; passed the first tariff legislation to provide an incomefor the federal government; and created the structure and committeesof both houses.   Although that first Congress convened on March 4, it took weeksfor each chamber to gain a quorum: April 1 for the House and April 6for the Senate.   Thursday's ceremony was a bit reminiscent of the initialdifficulty Congress had in assembling a quorum. Neither the 435-seatHouse nor the Senate had a quorum of its members present _ only 20of the 100 members of the Senate were to be seen.</TEXT></DOC>
