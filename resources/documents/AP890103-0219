In a 290-page decision dated Friday and released today, a panelof three administrative law judges said there is ``reasonableassurance that adequate protective measures can and will be takenwithin the New Hampshire portion'' of a 10-mile evacuation zonearound the plant.   Part of the zone lies in Massachusetts, which has refused tocooperate in the planning for an evacuation.   The plant's operator, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, hassubmitted a plan for Massachusetts communities. But the AtomicSafety and Licensing Board panel of law judges has yet to hold ahearing on it.   A recent order from President Reagan gave the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency authority to draw up a plan and operate it if astate refuses to take part.   Today's approval was conditioned on several paperwork tasks andresolving a traffic issue the board said had not been considered _workers in the area going home before they begin evacuating the area.   The board said it would seek advice from various groups on how todeal with that issue but added that ``the omission of the commutertrips to home will not have a large effect'' on the plan.   Several local officials, including teachers, had testified atboard hearings they would abandon their jobs or pupils in favor oftaking care of their own families rather than carry out dutiesassigned to them in the evacuation plan.   ``The board does not accept the implied conclusion of theteachers' testimony that virtually all of the teachers in the(10-mile zone) will abruptly abandon their pupils without evenpausing to account for them and seeing them to a school bus...,''the law judges said.   ``While we would not expect heroic behavior from all of theteachers, neither would we accept panic from all of them,'' thelicensing board said.   The law judges found the teachers' testimony ``perplexing'' andsaid it ``does not represent traditional American values andhistory.''   ``Where those relied upon to respond in an emergency know thatthey have a role, and are trained to that role, as a group they willnot fail their communities,'' the board opined.   The $5.7 billion Seabrook plant was completed two years ago buthas been idle because of the dispute over the evacuation plan.   The commission has said it will grant a low-power testing licenseas soon as Public Service Co. can present evidence that it would beable to pay for closing and decommissioning he plant once itscomponents become radioactive.   The company, which is operating under the protection ofbankruptcy courts, has said it expects to satisfy that requirementin a few weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
