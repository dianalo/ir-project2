The House voted 249-166 Thursday to begin dispensing $1.2billion to the 60,000 survivors of the camps. The Senate coulddebate the bill as early as today, and it is expected to be passedand quickly signed by President Bush.   The measure provides $500 million for the payments in the fiscalyear that began Oct. 1, the same amount the next year and theremaining $200 million beginning October 1992.   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., a Japanese-American who as a childwas confined to one of the camps, said time was essential because200 former internees die each month.   Camp survivors who already have died passed away ``still waitingfor the stigma on their loyalty to be lifted,'' he said.   The camps, set up in 1942 after war broke out with Japan, weresparked by fears that Japanese-Americans would subvert the U.S. wareffort. About 120,000 Japanese-Americans spent most of the war inthe camps.   Conservatives didn't challenge the justification for thepayments, which were authorized in a law last year. But theyobjected to language making the disbursements automatic, thusremoving them from competition with other programs for scarcefederal dollars.   ``Do you elevate these payments above child care?'' asked Rep.Harold Rogers, R-Ky. ``The defense of the country?''   The money is part of a House-Senate compromise for fiscal 1990providing $17.2 billion for the departments of Commerce, Justiceand State.   In addition to funding for the reparation, the bill leavesintact the Census Bureau practice of counting illegal aliens.   Next year's count will be used to redraw House district lines,and lawmakers from states with few illegal immigrants complain thatincluding them inflates the number of congressional seats fromborder states. The Senate had voted to prohibit counting thealiens, but House-Senate bargainers dropped the provision.   The legislation contains new restrictions on the directors ofthe Legal Services Corp., the federally subsidized agency thatprovides legal aid to the poor. Liberals say the corporation boardis dominated by Reagan-era appointees, and the measure wouldprevent changes in regulations until new directors are appointed.   Conservatives lost two efforts, 206-199 and 223-178, to limitthe corporation's participation in suits on behalf of migrantworkers and erect other constraints.   The bill also includes:   _$15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice WarrenBurger for the Supreme Court. Court officials say portraits of theother 14 chief justices already hang in the building. The money wasobtained by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., an old friend of Burger, andSen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who employs a former Burger clerk.   _A prohibition on the launch of American-built satellites byChina or the Soviet Union. The ban against China would be lifted ifBush certifies that martial law has been lifted and other reformsmade.   _A requirement that the government seek treaties with othercountries to protect sea turtles.   _Many pet projects, including $5.5 million for a clinical lawcenter at Seton Hall University in Newark, N.J.; $4.5 million for ahealth center at Voorhees College in Denmark, S.C.; and $5.2million for a science research center at the University of Kansasin Lawrence.</TEXT></DOC>
