No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge Wednesday denied a petition to freeanti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch, whom the Justice Department istrying to deport as ``Miami's No. 1 terrorist.''   But U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler ordered that Boschnot be expelled while his attorneys exhaust their appeals of theextradition order, made by the Justice Department in June.   Bosch, considered by some exiles a hero of the anti-Castrostruggle, has been held at the federal Metropolitan CorrectionalCenter south of Miami since February 1988 when he returned to theUnited States from Venezuela.   ``This order concludes another chapter in the sad odyssey ofOrlando Bosch Avila,'' Hoeveler wrote in a 12-page ruling. ``Once ahero of Cuban resistance to Castro's communist takeover, hisefforts became sullied by his extremes and eventually resulted inhis imprisonment.''   Bosch was convicted of a 1968 bazooka attack on a Polish ship inMiami and fled the U.S. while on probation in 1974. He was laterjailed for 11 years in Venezuela in the bombing of a Cubanairliner, killing 73 people, but he was never convicted in theattack.   According to CIA documents released by the Justice Department,the 62-year-old Cuban doctor ran successful bombing raids in Cubain the early 1960s. U.S. intelligence reports have linked Bosch toterrorist bombings throughout the U.S. and Latin America into the1970s, and he is regarded by the FBI as ``Miami's No. 1 terrorist.''   But his attorneys say that Bosch now repudiates violence, andhis family believes he'll be killed if he is deported.   Some prominent Cuban Americans have asked President Bush tointervene, but the White House has said it won't comment on theBosch case while it's in the courts.   Bosch's attorney, Raul Cantero, planned continuing the legalbattle, saying, ``I think it's an issue we can win. It's up to thefamily to decide whether they want to go through the aggravation ofanother few months litigating this.''   But Bosch's daughter, Myriam, left the court in tears.   ``He's a pediatrician,'' she said of her father. ``He's a loverof people _ and this is how this country pays him back.''</TEXT></DOC>
