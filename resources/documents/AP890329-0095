Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo cautioned communist leaders inthe North Korean capital of Pyongyang against continuing contactswith South Korean dissidents outside official channels.   ``If North Korea continues to use our sincere effort towardunification for anti-South Korea political manipulation, it willnot escape from all responsibility arising therefrom,'' he said.   The Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, adviser to the dissident United NationalDemocratic Movement, arrived in Pyongyang on a secret visitSaturday, violating the requirement for prior government approval.   Thousands of students tried to march from campuses into thestreets of the southern cities of Taegu and Kwanju, and hundreds ofriot officers fired tear gas to stop them, police and withessessaid.   Protesters shouted ``Unification!'' and ``Down with RohTae-woo!''   Lee accused North Korea of trying to undermine President Roh'sgovernment by expanding contacts with South Korean dissidents, andaccused it of incidting communist revolution in the South.   He issued the statement after Premier Kang Young-hoon and othersenior government and party officials met to discuss Moon's visitto North Korea.   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthey agreed to continue efforts to ease tension on the dividedpeninsula but would do so in a ``cautious'' manner. Roh'sgovernment has tried to improve relations with North Korea andincrease trade with other communist nations.   Moon, 71, arrived in Pyongyang by way of Japan and China. Hissupporters say the visit opens a new phase in reunification effortsand criticized prosecutors' plans to arrest him on his return home,expected next week.   Roh's government says dissidents are trying to undermine itsauthority.   About 5,000 students from 13 colleges gathered at ChonamUniversity in Kwangju to denounce the government and demandreunification, said a report by the South Korean news agency Yonhap.   Another 5,000 students and workers attended a rally at KyemyongUniversity in Taegu, where dissident leader Paek Ki-wan declaredthat Moon went to North Korea to speak for farmers, workers and thepoor. Paek claimed the government was not interested in unification.   Officials in Seoul said Moon, who met President Kim Il Sung ofNorth Korea on Monday, may face charges that could put him inprison for 10 years.   Seoul newspapers said the government may cancel a scheduledApril visit to North Korea by Chung Ju-yung, founder of the HyundaiGroup, one of South Korea's largest business conglomerates.   Chung has been negotiating joint ventures with North Korea,including a resort development in the Diamond Mountains on the eastcoast. He visited Pyongyang in January with the permission of bothgovernments.   The two nations have held a series of political and sportstalks, including a meeting Tuesday on a possible joint team for the1990 Asian Games in Beijing.   They remain technically at war and the border has been sealedsince the conflict of 1950-53, but government-level talks have beenheld irregularly since the early 1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
