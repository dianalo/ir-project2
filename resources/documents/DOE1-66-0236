<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0236 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report provides a detailed evaluation of the potential biologicaleffects of fringe magnetic fields associated with a superconducting magneticenergy storage (SMES) plant. The aspects of magnetic fields that arediscussed include mechanisms of interaction of static and slowly time-varyingmagnetic fields with living systems; biological effects of magnetic fieldson human and subhuman species, including the results of both laboratorystudies and human epidemiological surveys; physical hazards posed bythe interactions of magnetic fields with metallic implants, e.g., aneurysmclips and prostheses, and with medical electronic devices such as cardiacpacemakers; extant guidelines for occupational exposure to magnetic fieldsare summarized; recommendations for defining acceptable levels of exposureto SMES magnetic fields by occupational personnel and the population-at-large;and recommendations concerning several areas of research that would furtherour understanding of magnetic field interactions with living systems,and would provide additional elements of information required for thedevelopment of future exposure standards. 328 refs., 12 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
