(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LSI Logic has announced a family of chips designed for image compressionapplications.andP;  A two-chip set, the LVC650 Image Compression Processor andL64750 CCITT Variable Length Coder/Decoder, is designed for JPEGapplications.andP;  JPEG Joint Photographic Expert's Group) is likely to dominatecontinuous-tone, stillimage compression.andP;  C-Cube Microsystems introduced asingle-chip JPEG compression/expansion device earlier this year (see[micro]PR 3/7/90).andP;  At $150 in 1000s, LSI Logic's two-chip solution is pricedslightly lower than C-Cube's $155 single-chip design, but it won't be inproduction until the second quarter of next year.andP;  LSI claims their chip setwill be capable of processing 20 broadcast-quality frames per second.andM;LSI has gone beyond JPEG, however, by providing a set of building blocks forimplementing systems using the P*64 (also known as CCITT H.261) videoteleconferencing standard and the emerging MPEG (Motion Picture Expert'sGroup) standard.andP;  The table below summarizes LSI's offerings.andP;  A chip set forCCIIT H.261 teleconferencing applications consists of two 64760s, three64730s, and one each of the 64715, '20, '30, '40, '50, and '51, and is pricedat $700 in 1000s.andM;Image compression is rapidly growing application area for digital systems.andO;Many companies have their eyes on this market, and a variety of competingsolutions will appear in the next year.andP;  LSI hopes that its building-blockapproach and standard-cell design approach will enable it to quickly adapt toemerging standards and provide solutions for a variety of applications andprice/performance points.andM;The JPEG standard, which deals with individual frames as isolated items,reached the draft proposal form last April and is expected to be formallyaccepted without changes early next year.andP;  The MPEG standard is designed formotion pictures and takes advantage of similarities between frames, allowingvideo to be compressed more than three times as much as with JPEG at the samequality level.andP;  This standard is still in its formative stages; a draftproposal should be completed next spring, with formal acceptance in '92.andM;Intel is expected to introduce their next-generation DVI (digital videointeractive) chip set later this year, which-unlike the hardwired devicesfrom LSI Logic and C-Cube-is a programmable processor that can implement avariety of algorithms.andP;  For the moment, Intel's proprietary algorithm is theonly solution for decompressing full-motion video from a CD-ROM.andP;  MPEG willalso provide this capability, and at a higher quality level, but it is muchmore compute-intensive and low-cost silicon implementations won't beavailable until 1992 or later.andP;  Intel intends to support JPEG and MPEGstandards, in addition to their proprietary algorithm, using theirprogrammable hardware.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
