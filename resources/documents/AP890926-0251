(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A subsidiary of Whittaker Corp. and twoformer executives pleaded guilty today to charges they bribed aMarine Corps contracting official to increase the value of Pentagonelectronic contracts their company obtained.   Whittaker Command and Control Systems pleaded guilty toconspiracy to defraud the government and two counts of bribingformer Marine Corps official Jack Sherman with nearly $75,000between 1982 and 1988.   The Whittaker subsidiary agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines,civil penalties and reimbursement for the cost of the investigation.   Scott M. Lamberth, 59, the former head of the subsidiary, andJohn F. Van Tassel, ex-director of operations at its Fayetteville,Ark., facility, also entered guilty pleas before U.S. DistrictJudge Claude M. Hilton.   The plea by the Whittaker subsidiary is the third by acorporation since the investigation began last year. TeledyneElectronics and Hazeltine Corp. have both entered guilty pleas fortheir roles in the procurement scandal.   According to court papers, officials of Whittaker Corp. of LosAngeles were unaware of the bribery scheme, which began before thecompany acquired the subsidiary in 1986.   The bribery scheme allegedly began in 1982 when the company wasknown as Lee Telecommunications and continued two years after itsacquisition by Whittaker.   Lamberth was a stockholder of the company and became head of thesubsidiary following its acquisition by Whittaker. Court paperssaid Lamberth hid the scheme from Whittaker officials.   The bribes allegedly were funneled to Sherman through defenseconsultants John Marlowe, Thomas Muldoon and Donald Illeman.   Marlowe is cooperating with the FBI's continuing investigationof Pentagon procurement fraud dubbed ``Operation Ill Wind.''Muldoon and Illeman have not been charged.   Sherman, who pleaded guilty to taking bribes from Marlowe aspart of an FBI undercover sting, signed authorizations that greatlyenhanced the value of two contracts the company obtained to helpthe Marines develop a battlefield air traffic control system, courtpapers said.   Sherman signed papers increasing the value of one contract from$600,000 to $2.5 million, according to the papers, and alsoauthorized the enhancement of another contract's value from$540,000 to $3.6 million.   He also authorized the transfer to Lee Telecommunications ofanother contract worth $1.6 million when the company that firstobtained the deal had difficulty developing software, the courtpapers said.   Lamberth faced a possible 20-year sentence and fines up to$500,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy and bribery.   Van Tassel could be sentenced to up to 15 years and fined$250,000 for his bribery plea.   Hilton scheduled a Dec. 15 sentencing proceeding for bothdefendants, who have agreed to cooperate with the investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
