Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, also told reporters after meetingHanoi's U.N. ambassador that the envoy was ``very positive'' aboutthe idea of establishing an unofficial American presence in Vietnamfor humanitarian purposes, primarily help for Amerasian childrenwhose mothers were Vietnamese and fathers were U.S. servicemenduring the Vietnam War.   Murkowski, who plans another in a series of visits to Vietnam inMarch, talked to reporters Friday after meeting on Capitol Hill withVietnam's U.N. ambassador, Trinh Xuan Lang. Lang was the first Hanoiofficial in Washington for official meetings since the northern halfof Vietnam became independent from France in 1954.   ``I asked about the Soviet presence at Cam Ranh Bay,'' Murkowskisaid, referring to the giant port built by the United States duringthe Vietnam War and now the Soviet Union's largest overseas militarybase.   ``I was very pleased at the response that there is considerationgiven to opening that port up to all the countries of the world,''he said. ``I said sure, you'd find the United States interested inoccasionally calling in there.''   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last September offered todismantle the base at Cam Ranh Bay in exchange for the United Statesgiving up its key bases in the Philippines. Washington reactedcoolly and later agreed on terms with the Philippines for continueduse of its installations until 1991.   Ambassador Lang, at a meeting with State and Defense Departmentand National Security Council officials, promised that Hanoi wouldcontinue to cooperate with U.S. efforts to account for about 1,700American servicemen still missing in the Indochina War, the StateDepartment said Friday.   The department relaxed rules restricting the U.N. envoy to theNew York City area to enable him to attend a Washington receptionand used his presence to stress U.S. concern about the POW-MIAissue. State Department spokesman Charles Redman reiterated thatnormalization of U.S. relations with Hanoi depends on completewithdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Cambodia.   Lang said later he was ``very satisfied'' with his meetings,which he said aimed ``at better understanding and reconciliation.''   U.S.-Vietnam relations ``sooner or later'' will be normalized, hetold reporters on Capitol Hill.   Murkowski urged U.S. efforts in the meantime to complete thecomplicated finding and processing for entry to the United States ofthousands of people enduring hardship in Vietnam today because theyhad American fathers or American connections during the war, andtheir families.   Murkowski said the ambassador told him Hanoi was agreeable toallowing representatives of U.S. private voluntary organizations toestablish a ``humanitarian presence'' for such purposes in Saigon,since renamed Ho Chi Minh City.   The senator estimated 12,000 Amerasian children of Americanfathers, now young adults, remain in Vietnam and that with familymembers a total of up to 36,000 people could be involved. Estimatesof the number of Vietnamese marked as U.S. sympathizers andsubjected after the war to detention and ``re-education'' varywidely and have run as high as 500,000.</TEXT></DOC>
