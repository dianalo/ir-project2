Bentsen, the Texas senator who was the Democrats' vicepresidential nominee in 1988, isn't the only prominent Democratkeeping tabs on Iowa, the state with the first caucuses in thepresidential sweepstakes.   Those mulling a run for the White House in 1992 _ or consultantslooking to align themselves with a presidential campaign _ arekeeping an eye on 1990 elections in Iowa, which has tough contestsfor governor and Senate.   ``Anybody who is looking down the road to 1992 has a good reasonto visit the state,'' said Phil Roeder, political director forDemocratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who is being challenged next year byRepublican Rep. Tom Tauke.   Indeed, many potential 1992 Democratic candidates have beenstopping in Iowa of late.   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley came to raise money for Harkin, andactivists on hand said there was some informal talk about thepossibility of a Bradley presidential bid.   Bentsen was the featured speaker at the state Democratic Party'sannual fund-raiser this past fall, denying any interest in runningfor president in 1992 but nonetheless taking time to talk toreporters about his ideas for national election strategy.   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, winner of the 1988 Iowacaucuses, visited recently, and Jesse Jackson was on hand the dayafter the last election and since to speak at a funeral.   ``Those people have been out here under the auspices of helpingthe Democratic Party,'' said Shanahan. ``You can read whatever youwant into that, but we're glad they're here.''   And, although President Bush is expected to be unopposed for theRepublican nomination should he seek re-election, Democrats haven'thad the state to themselves.   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm and television evangelist Pat Robertson,an unsuccessful 1988 GOP presidential candidate who finished secondin Iowa last year behind Sen. Bob Dole, have dropped in for quickvisits, fueling speculation they might be looking down the road to1996.   Iowa political operatives aren't surprised at the earlyattention; presidential candidates who have done well here oftenbegan their caucus campaigns a year or more before the vote.   Said Roeder:   ``If we get by with 12 to 15 hours of down time between the 1990elections and the beginning of the 1992 caucuses, that will be apretty liberal amount of time.''</TEXT></DOC>
