The dog will goalong with it for only so long and then he'll bite,'' says JeremyD. Conway, chief of investigations for the Canadian Department ofFisheries and Oceans.   When the World Court divided the territory about 120 miles offCape Cod in 1984, American scallopers learned fast that theirtwo-thirds couldn't match the Canadians' rich portion. Periodicincursions became the norm.   But the raids have more than tripled in recent weeks, accordingto Canadian and U.S. officials, who report as many as 20 U.S. boatsnow cluster at the international line each night.   Last week, a Canadian navy destroyer tailed a Fairhaven,Mass.-based scalloper for 12 hours, during which a collision wasreported and warning shots were fired.   Canadian scallopers, who have observed government-imposedfishing quotas, are near despair. Their industry is losing morethan a $1 million a month to poachers even as 1,500 factory workersin the outpost town of Canso are losing their jobs and skippers aremissing boat payments, officials said.   ``We wouldn't allow American citizens to come up and raid ourshopping malls or banks,'' said Carl Goodwin, chief of surveillanceoperations at the Canadian fisheries department. ``Why let themraid our natural resources? We have to stop this before someonegets hurt.''   Radar and patrol records indicate a clear pattern. As soon asthe lone naval destroyer patrolling the boundary starts moving outof sight, intruders steam in and haul out as many scallops aspossible. When the patrol ship comes back into view, the violatorstake off.   The incursions have become easier because Nova Scotia'sscallopers have been ashore since October, when they filled theirquotas. At the same time, Canada's Coast Guard, which usuallypatrols the Hague Line, has been on strike.   Robert Prier, the fishing department's director of conservationand protection, said ``the flagrant disregard for Canadianboundaries and authorities'' has worn very thin and warships havebeen more frequently giving chase.   ``They have been tolerant in the past, but this latest actionsignifies a new direction in Canadian policy,'' said Lt. CraigLloyd, who is based at Coast Guard headquarters in Boston. ``Wewill not interfere with their law enforcement efforts ininternational waters.''   Lloyd said no Canadians have been reported poaching in U.S.waters, but, ``if we had Canadian fishing vessels over on our sideof the line we would take action to stop them.''   The Fairhaven-based Concordia's captain said his chartsindicated he was in international waters. He compared the ``hotpursuit'' to a wartime assault.   ``Even if they see a boat fishing a half-mile over the line andchase them out, isn't that good enough? Why do they want to startsinking boats?'' William Furey Jr. asked Sunday.   ``You're talking about a small boat and a few scallops or a fewfish. Is that serious enough to have 10 families burying their sonor husband a Christmas time?''   But Canadian officials and fishermen, who note the high technavigation equipment virtually all scallopers use, rejected thescenario.   ``If you don't want war then don't break the rules,'' Goodwinsaid. ``And if you want to take the risk ... then don't cry whenthe shots are fired, or say we're too aggressive.''   For the Canadian scallopers moored along these craggy shores,the violations provoke a particularly bitter reaction. They stuckto the government quotas imposed to protect against overfishing andtied up their boats more than two months ago.   Now it's Christmas time. Their savings are stretched and thecommunity's frustration mounts daily with second-hand reports ofhow American poachers are illegally hauling in a hefty holidaycatch.   ``Our boats are tied up and men are out of work while theseAmerican guys are catching our scallops,'' said Albert Eisner, whostarted fishing as a teen-ager. ``They're making fools of us. It'san insult.''   The story was different for the generations of scallopers fromNew England and Canada who fished Georges Bank side by side, butthe brothers bound by sea have turned to battle since the HagueLine was drawn.   ``These guys have so many common bonds in the maritimeenvironment. They've often helped each other out through theyears,'' said Fred Greene, who runs several Nova Scotia-areafishing enterprises. ``But our fishermen are being pushed todesperation.''   The problem defies easy solution. Canada lacks a treaty toextradite Americans for fishing violations. Lloyd said the U.S.Coast Guard planned to step up patrols and officials from bothcountries have been discussing stiffer penalties for U.S.intruders, but so far they're still paying less than 1 percent ofthe $700,000 fines Canadian violators pay.   ``You can't go out and solve this with warships. There's got tobe a better way,'' said Paul Allen, who has been scalloping for 34years. ``But we better do something soon because I've no doubt it'sgoing to get worse.''</TEXT></DOC>
