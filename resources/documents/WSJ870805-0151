The Southern Africa Bus and Taxi Association, or Sabta, a national organization of 45,000 black taxi owners and drivers, said it will exercise its option to purchase a 52.5% stake in Putco for a reported 156 million rand ($75.5 million). It said it has approached two leading black business organizations, African Bank and the National African Chambers of Commerce, to become its partners in the purchase.    As previously reported, a consortium of white businessmen had offered five million rand to buy Sabta's option to purchase Putco. The whites had expressed concern about the implications of black control over a business they labeled &quot;strategic&quot; because it transports labor vital to South Africa's economy.    Each day, one million blacks ride Putco's 3,000 buses from their homes in the black townships to their jobs. Putco, which is widely seen as a tool of apartheid, has been a frequent target of black political unrest in the townships.    Sabta said it will soon conduct a survey of its customers to gauge black opinion of Putco being taken over by a black organization. Sabta is hoping that its ownership will remove the apartheid stigma hanging over the company and make it less of a target for protesters. </TEXT></DOC>
