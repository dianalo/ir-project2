Although the expected rate cut won't provide a big boost to the sluggish German economy, it is the first example of immediate actions that Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg plans to take following the accord in Washington to reduce the U.S. budget deficit. Mr. Stoltenberg has for the time being ruled out such bold fiscal measures as an enlargement or an acceleration of tax cuts that critics, including the U.S., have demanded, but he hasn't ruled out all fiscal steps entirely, the sources said.    The rate cut by Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau -- a Frankfurt-based lending institution, 80%-owned by the federal government, that provides corporations and new ventures with subsidized loans for domestic investment -- may be announced by Mr. Stoltenberg as early as this week, the sources said. It also may be taken in tandem with further rate cuts by Germany's central bank, the sources suggested. Last week, the Bundesbank led a round of interest-rate cuts by four European nations that also was partly a response to the U.S. budget agreement.    Mr. Stoltenberg said last week in a speech to the German parliament that the government would soon unveil new proposals for stimulating its economy, but he didn't disclose details. Before that speech, he had suggested that steps the German government was contemplating were of a passive nature: a willingness to allow government budget deficits to grow beyond current projections.    But now the finance minister appears to be more amenable to demands world-wide that the German government do more to support its economy. Sources suggest, moreover, that Mr. Stoltenberg has been waging a behind-the-scenes campaign to influence the Bundesbank's interest-rate policies, which he has said may be more effective than fiscal measures in stimulating the economy.    A discount-rate cut by the central bank generally is expected soon. Speculation had been that the Bundesbank would delay a rate reduction until the seven largest industrialized democracies meet; a meeting of the nations, known as the Group of Seven, or G-7, isn't expected for several weeks. Now, however, senior government officials say they anticipate a cut sooner rather than later.    &quot;I think Minister Stoltenberg would like to have everything the government intends to offer out on the table in the next two weeks, before the meeting,&quot; said one senior government source, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. &quot;That includes rate cuts by the Bundesbank. &quot;The official cautioned, however, that the central bank guards its autonomy closely and that policy decisions are the ultimate responsibility of a 17-member governing council. That panel will hold a regularly scheduled meeting Thursday to review monetary policy.    A Finance Ministry spokesman declined to comment on the rate cut at Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, which last year provided loans totaling 14 billion West German marks ($8.38 billion). Its current lending rates range from 5.25% to 5.75% and are lower than rates available at commercial banks.    Besides interest-rate cuts, government sources said other immediate steps to stimulate the economy are under consideration. One notion, for instance, would be to increase capital investment at large institutions owned by the government, such as the Bundespost, Germany's state-owned postal and communications monopoly.    &quot;Stoltenberg won't dramatically change his fiscal policy,&quot; said Matthias Wissmann, the parliamentarian speaker on economics for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party, &quot;but he is also not excluding fiscal policy from the potential contributors.&quot;    The Bundespost also is likely to play an important role in Germany's future plans to stimulate the economy. Mr. Wissmann and others said the German government likely will commit to a deregulation of the Bundespost as part of a G-7 meeting.    Separately, the Federal Statistics Office reported on Friday that West Germany's trade surplus narrowed to 10.11 billion marks ($6.05 billion) in October from 10.70 billion marks a year earlier and 11.51 billion marks in September.    Imports totaled 38.67 billion marks in the latest month, up 3% from a year earlier and 12.8% higher than the September level. Exports rose more slowly, to 48.78 billion marks, up 1.1% from a year earlier and 6.5% above September's total.    The current-account surplus, which includes trade in goods and services as well as certain transfers, stood at 6.9 billion marks in October, down from 8.1 billion marks a year earlier but up from 6.5 billion marks in September, according to preliminary figures from the Bundesbank. </TEXT></DOC>
