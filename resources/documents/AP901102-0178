The Greenville City Council voted unanimously to settle thecase, which has haunted the east Texas town for eight years.   ``The city contends that its actions never violated the rightsof Geter and the other plaintiffs,'' said Dianne Callander, cityattorney. ``But this situation ... has created, to myunderstanding, a schism in the community.''   Geter, who is black, was sentenced to life in prison in 1982 forthe armed robbery of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, eventhough his co-workers at E-Systems, a defense contractor, testifiedhe was at work that day.   An all-white Dallas County jury convicted Geter and he served 18months before he was exonerated.   U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders dismissed most of Geter'sclaims against the city and its police department Aug. 14. Theclaims against Greenville police Lt. Jim Fortenberry, whooriginally implicated Geter in the robbery, were left intact.   Geter's attorney, George Hairston, was unavailable for commentFriday when contacted at his New York office.   According to the settlement, which brings to an end the nearly7-year-old lawsuit, the council does not admit liability of its ownor fault on the part of Fortenberry.   Before the settlement, Geter's attorneys offered out-of-courtsettlements of up to $1 million, which the city council rejected.   Geter's case received national attention and was the subject ofa CBS ``60 Minutes'' story and a television movie.   The settlement will come out of the city's general fund.</TEXT></DOC>
