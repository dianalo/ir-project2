JESSE JACKSON, saying Koch, President Reagan and formerDemocratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro haveraised ``race-based questions'' on the eve of the New York primary:``We went across the South on Super Tuesday without a singlecat-call or boo. ... It was not until we got north to New York thatthe litmus tests of race and religion became spouted from themouths of public officials without a significant media challenge.''      ALBERT GORE, renewing his attack on Michael Dukakis involvingnuclear policy in Europe: ``To say NATO policy is `no early firstuse' is another error. ... We have not adopted that policy.
