The include total cross section measurements of themagnetic substates of the He(3{sup 3}P) level populated in He{sup +}-H{sub2}, He{sup +}-D{sub 2} and He{sub 2}{sup +}-He collisions and the He(3{sup1}P) level populated in He{sup +}-H{sub 2} and He{sup +}-D{sub 2} collisions.The cross sections show an oscillatory behavior which suggests that thereare long-range interactions of the quasimolecular states (Rosenthal oscillations).The nature of the oscillatory structure is dependent upon the detailsof the potential curves of the (He-H{sub 2}/D{sub 2}){sup +} complex.Use of the quasidatomic model allows construction of diabatic statesthat enable the identification of the dominant excitation channels. Inaddition to oscillatory structure, the m{sub 1} = +/-1 cross sectionsexhibit an isotope shift both in relative velocity dependence and inthe magnitude of the cross section for population of He(3{sup 1}P) andHe(3{sup 3}P) in He{sup +}-H{sub 2}/D{sub 2} collisions. Similar shiftsare predicted by theories of rotational coupling in ion-atom collisionsand result from differences in the projectile trajectories for the differenttarget masses.</TEXT></DOC>
