Two Americans who were taken captive at the outbreak of theinvasion were freed. About 2,000 new U.S. troops began reinforcingthe thousands of troops who have met unexpectedly stiff resistanceby forces loyal to the ousted dictator.   Troops continued the hunt for the elusive Noriega.   Lt. Col. Jerry Marguila, spokesman for the U.S. SouthernCommand, said Noriega's Dignity Battalions are ``increasing theiractivities of harassing attacks with small arms and mortar fire,threatening the civilian population, and hostage-taking.''   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of Southern Command, said U.S.forces are not yet ``over and done with the Dignity Battalions.''He said earlier that an estimated 1,800 members of the battalionswere active, broken up into small groups.   The Pentagon reported that 25 U.S. servicemen, four more thanlisted Friday, had been killed in the fighting. Officials also saidtwo American dependents had been killed, 241 U.S. troops had beenwounded, and one was still missing.   The military said 139 Panamanian soldiers had been killed and 95wounded. There was no official count of casualties among Panamaniancivilians.   There were reports of higher casualties. Dr. Elmer Miranda,deputy director of Santo Tomas Hospital, said his morgue held 200bodies. He said a colleague said there were 60 more in GorgasHospital, run by the U.S. Southern Command.   ``Noriega destroyed everything when he fell. Everything wentback to zero,'' said President Guillermo Endara, who was sworn inWednesday morning shortly after the U.S. attack began.   Endara said in an interview that the news of the U.S. invasionwas ``like a kick in the head. It was not the best thing I wouldhave thought.''   ``We were not really consulted,'' said Endara, who said he was``very diplomatically'' told of President Bush's plans only two orthree hours before the invasion was launched. He said plans forkeeping public order should have been worked out better in advance.   ``I would have been happier without an intervention,'' he said.But he said he could work with the Americans: ``The gringos havetheir defects, but I am used to ... them.''   The 24,000-member U.S. force has been unable to put downremaining loyalists, some of whom attacked Southern Commandheadquarters Friday. The loyalists periodically surprised theAmericans with mortars and sniper fire. Noriega remained at large,with rumors flying as to his whereabouts. forces at thepresidential palace had turned themselves in and the building hadbeen secured.   Thurman, speaking at a briefing, also said a total of 2,250people had been detained, 15,500 weapons seized, and 33 armoredvehicles captured.   Pro-Noriega forces released Jon Meyersohn, a CBS News producerseized Wednesday at the Marriott Hotel, and Doug Mullen, anexecutive with GTE who was taken along with Meyersohn. There hadbeen no earlier reports of Mullen's captivity.   Meyersohn told a news conference in Panama City that he andMullen were taken to several locations during their captivity,first to a jungle clearing, then to a farmhouse, then to anapartment in the city.   He said their hands had been tied, they were at one point boundto trees, and they feared for their lives. However, he said theywere not mistreated.   The hostages were held in the jungle by five captors _ three menand two women _ armed with knives, pistols, grenades, and automaticweapons, Meyersohn said. He identified the men as current or formermembers of the Panamanian Defense Forces.   He said Mullen, who speaks Spanish, finally managed to persuadethe captors to let them make a telephone call Friday, allowing themto contact their families and employers. They were releasedSaturday at a neutral location, he said.   Four days of fighting have left parts of Panama City in ruins,with buildings demolished by U.S. bombings and streets litteredwith debris from rampant looting. The capital of 1 million issuffering from a growing shortage of food and medicine.   ``We are trying to open the airport and trying to open theBridge of the Americas so we can bring in medicine and food,''Endara said in the interview.   Airports around the country and the bridge were closed for thefourth day. The bridge is the main crossing of the Panama Canal,which splits the country in two.   Thousands of Panamanians sought refuge in schools and churchesto escape the fighting and many formed neighborhood vigilantegroups and set up barricades to protect themselves from looters.About 28,000 people were left homeless by the destruction of the ElChorrillo neighborhood near Noriega's headquarters.
