A microscopic theoreticalframework for the many-body reaction provides a clear conceptual (nonrelativistic)basis for treating final state interactions and goes far beyond simplewave or Hermitean potential models. The many-body physics of inelasticfinal state channels as described by optical and multiple scatteringtheories included by incorporating a full complex optical potential.Explicit nonrelativistic and relativistic momentum-space calculationsquantitatively demonstrate the importance of such a treatment of finalstate interactions for both the transverse and longitudinal response.Nonrelativistic calculations are performed using final state interactionsbased on phenomenology, local density models and microscopic multiplescattering theory. Relativistic calculations span a similar range ofmodels and employ Dirac bound state wave functions. The theoretical extensionto relativistic dynamics is of course not clear, but is done in obviousparallel to elastic proton scattering. Extensive calculations are performedfor {sup 40}Ca at momentum transfers of 410, 550 and 700 MeV/c. A numberof interesting physical effects are observed, including significant relativisticsuppressions (especially for R{sub L}), large-off-shell and virtual paireffects, enhancement of the tails of the response by the final stateinteractions, and large qualitative and even shape distinctions betweenthe predictions of the various models of the final state interactions.None of the models is found to be able to simultaneously predict thedata for both response functions. This strongly suggests that additionalphysical mechanisms are of qualitative importance in inclusive quasielasticelectron scattering. 48 refs., 16 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
