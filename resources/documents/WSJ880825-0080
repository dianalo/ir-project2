Next Tuesday in Chicago, the ruling council of the 272,000-member American Institute of Certified Public Accountants -- under regulatory pressure to become more competitive -- will vote in a closed session on whether to drop bans against such compensation.    Under a proposed compromise between the institute and the Federal Trade Commission, the bans would be lifted, with one major exception. They still would apply in situations involving clients where accounting firms perform audits, do financial reviews and compile data.    Several types of fees are at issue. First are commissions that accountants might get for steering business to a client; accountants, for instance, could earn money from sellers of computer equipment, if a client took the accountant's advice and bought the equipment. Then there are contingency fees, which would give accountants a percentage of savings they achieve for a client by devising such things as a cost-cutting plan, or for assisting in a merger or acquisition.    In a letter last year to the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, the FTC said allowing contingency fees could lower the cost and raise the quality of accounting services by linking CPAs' fees to the results of a job rather than the time put into it. In the same letter, the FTC said allowing commissions would give consumers an option of &quot;one-stop shopping for financial-planning services,&quot; thereby letting accountants be more competitive with rivals in other fields.    Under current ethics rules of the institute, the industry's principal professional group, accountants can only charge hourly fees for such advice and cannot accept any contingency fees or commissions. Contingency fees and commissions may be much bigger than hourly fees, but an accountant runs the risk of working for nothing if, for example, a client doesn't follow his advice.    But for many accountants, the major problem with fees and commissions is that they are fertile ground for conflicts of interest because they could lead an accountant to give biased advice just to get a bigger fee. Accepting such fees could change accounting to a cutthroat business from a profession with a reputation for objectivity, advocates of the ban say.    &quot;Permitting contingency fees and commissions will only make us unprofessional and create a lot of problems for our clients,&quot; says Edwin Kliegman, managing partner of Marcum andamp; Kliegman, a small Hicksville, N.Y., accounting firm.    But some accountants say dropping the bans would benefit clients by allowing accountants to compete with other consultants who are under no such restrictions.    H.D. Vest, an Irving, Texas, accountant who has threatened to sue the institute if it doesn't drop the bans, says eliminating the restrictions &quot;will permit CPAs to provide broad-based financial services to their clients at lower prices.&quot; Mr. Vest, who began offering clients financial-planning services in 1979, has been the object of an institute investigation over ethics violations since 1985. Mr. Vest says he has been accepting contingency fees and commissions for several years from clients of his financial-services company, which offers insurance and brokerage services in addition to limited accounting services.    &quot;The institute restriction on commissions places us at a competitive disadvantage compared with other financial planners,&quot; Mr. Vest says.    While the FTC won't comment publicly on its two-year investigation of the institute's ethics rules, institute officials say the group has been negotiating with the agency almost as long over the bans on contingency fees and commissions. At first the FTC wanted the contingency fee and commission bans dropped for all work performed by accountants, but in recent months the agency has been more willing to compromise, institute officials say.    That's apparently because the institute late last year vowed to fight the FTC in court and pointed out that the bans were supported by its ruling council in four votes since 1984. But since then, some members of the institute who accept contingency fees and commissions in violation of its ethics ban have threatened to sue the group on antitrust grounds.    Willkie, Farr andamp; Gallagher, the institute's outside counsel, has advised the institute that in the current legal climate of open competition, the bans probably wouldn't be upheld in court. So last week the institute's 20-member board voted, without a public announcement, to advise the 259-member ruling council to accept a consent decree from the FTC dropping the bans for non-audit clients.    &quot;It's a very emotional issue with our members, but at this point we feel it would be very difficult in an antitrust sense to sustain total bans against all contingency fees and commissions,&quot; says Donald Schneeman, the institute's general counsel. &quot;We expect the council debate to be lively but have every expectation&quot; that it will accept the board's recommendation, he adds.    If the institute accepts the consent decree, an FTC agreement to drop its investigation would be subject to public comment and review by the full commission. Jeffrey I. Zuckerman, director of the FTC's bureau of competition, declines to comment on specifics of the consent decree. But he notes that the FTC doesn't have jurisdiction over state laws that can ban business practices of accountants. &quot;We're hopeful that if the institute drops its bans, the state boards of accountancy or legislatures will get the message,&quot; Mr. Zuckerman says. </TEXT></DOC>
