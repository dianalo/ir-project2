<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-01-1345 </DOCNO><TEXT>The {sup 13}C NMR spectra of peroxide derivatives of cyclanes and cyclicperoxides have been investigated. Replacement of the exocyclic OH groupby OOH for saturated cyclic systems leads to a displacement of the signalsfrom the {alpha}-carbon downfield by 13.0 ppm, while the {beta}carbonis displaced upfield by 4.5 ppm, without any dependence on the size orconformational structure of the rings. Replacement of the transannularOO group by CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2} or CH{sub 2}O increases the shieldingof the quaternary carbon adjoining it.</TEXT></DOC>
