Try a certificate of deposit from a failing bank or savings and loan.    Stretching for that last iota of yield on an investment usually involves a big gamble. But that isn't the case if Uncle Sam's on your side.    Deposits at most banks and Sandamp;Ls are insured for as much as $100,000 by the federal government. And the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which covers bank deposits, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which backs those at Sandamp;Ls, have recently implemented policy changes designed to speed payments to depositors when the worst happens.    &quot;As long as (the institution) really is FDIC or FSLIC-insured and principal and interest is less than $100,000, the investor's CD is safe,&quot; says Eric I. Hemel, a thrift analyst with First Boston Corp. and a former official at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts and controls the FSLIC.    Not every bank or thrift that offers an above-average CD rate is about to go belly up; even the healthiest institutions sometimes promote special high yields to win new business. But banks and Sandamp;Ls have been folding at the rate of one a day, and the shakiest institutions often pay the highest rates -- as much as a full percentage point above the national average.    With the government ready to pick up the tab if the worst does happen, what's to keep a person from just going for the highest yield, without worrying whether the institution offering it is a safe one or one that's about ready to tank? &quot;Nothing,&quot; says Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall.    The FDIC and the FSLIC have been stepping up efforts to prevent troubled institutions from luring cash with promises of excessive rates. &quot;If we see some evidence that that's a problem {with exorbitant rates}, bank examiners are on the scene very quickly,&quot; says a spokesman for the FDIC.    Such pressure has narrowed the differences in interest rates paid by various financial institutions. Currently, for instance, information compiled by Banxquote, a New York bank information service, shows that the top yield nationwide on a six-month CD is the 8.38% offered by CitiSavings of San Antonio, Texas; the national average is 7.64%. A year ago, the gap between the highest and the average was about two percentage points.    Still, that extra yield can be awfully appealing. And Wall Street securities firms are urging investors to bet on the government's backing.    Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. for example, has sold some $800 million of CDs for American Savings andamp; Loan of Stockton, Calif., says Al Disposti, manager of retail CD trading for the firm. American Savings, a unit of Financial Corp. of America and the nation's largest thrift, is currently insolvent, awaiting a takeover by the Bass group under an FSLIC-assisted rescue plan.    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is selling CDs for &quot;financially troubled institutions in Texas that are under Federal Home Loan Bank Board of Dallas management.&quot; The CDs are backed by a letter of credit from the Bank Board and pay about a fifth of a percentage point more than standard brokered CDs, says Mary Anthes, a Drexel vice president.    The FDIC and the FSLIC are obliged under their charters to insure depositors against loss of funds placed in insured institutions. But if they merge a failing institution with a healthy one, they aren't required to ensure that all accounts will earn the same rate of interest at the new bank as they did at the old one. And the agencies are supposed to act speedily, but there is no limit on how long they may take to pay out funds in the event of a liquidation.    In the past investors who relied on federal deposit insurance risked suffering delays of weeks or even months in reimbursement after an institution was shut down. In addition, the federal agencies that closed the doors sometimes paid investors an interest rate below the lofty yields promised by the insolvent institution.    Brokered CDs were particularly prone to delays in a liquidation because &quot;one huge CD can be owned by hundreds or thousands of people,&quot; and could take weeks to unwind, says Kathy Nagle, director of the insurance division of the FSLIC.    Consider First South Bank of Pine Bluff, Ark., which was closed by the FSLIC on Dec. 4, 1986, and had deposits of $1.4 billion. David Hinkson, manager of the credit department of A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., a St. Louis-based securities firm, says settlement of the claims of investors who'd bought First South CDs through his firm was &quot;excruciatingly slow.&quot;    Several thousand investors weren't made whole for months, he says. In the meantime, their funds were frozen, inconveniencing many who'd counted on the money for tuition or mortgage payments. CDs that matured during the period earned a passbook rate of return, &quot;quite below the current rate on CDs.&quot;    More and more, however, the agencies have been going beyond the mere requirements, making depositors whole and doing so more quickly.    Last year, the FSLIC and the Securities Industry Association worked out an agreement to streamline payouts when an institution is liquidated; a similar pact is expected this month between the SIA and the FDIC.    William Fitzpatrick, general counsel of the SIA, says the agreement avoids &quot;a tremendous amount of paperwork, and speeds up the process considerably.&quot; In one of its most recent liquidations, Farmers Savings Bank of Irvine, Calif., the FSLIC claims to have gotten deposits and interest to many investors within 48 hours.    At the same time, the FDIC and the FSLIC have been merging troubled banks and thrifts into strong ones instead of taking the messier liquidation route. When that happens, most individual depositors notice only a change in the letterhead on their monthly statements; all deposits, even those that exceed the $100,000 insurance limit, move undisturbed to the new institution.    So far this year, 84% of the thrift failures have been resolved through mergers rather than liquidations, as opposed to 51% in 1986. Similarly, 142 of the 170 banks that failed in 1988 have been merged with healthier institutions.    People with deposits of more than $100,000 could still lose any money in their accounts in excess of $100,000 if their bank or thrift is taken over by another institution in a &quot;transfer of assets&quot; rather than a merger. Even here, however, things are looking up. Both federal agencies say they now strongly prefer mergers in which assumption of the troubled institution's deposits at the same interest rate is a condition of the sale.    There is an ethical issue in all this, of course. People who pick a CD without regard to safety are ultimately counting on their fellow taxpayers to make good on their high-flying expectations if their bank does go bust.    True, premiums paid by financial institutions themselves fund federal deposit insurance. But the FSLIC is so deeply insolvent that many financial experts expect the government will eventually have to chip in billions of dollars out of tax revenues. While the government isn't absolutely, legally obligated to bail out the FSLIC, Congress has essentially pledged the full faith in credit of the government to back insured deposits.    ---                Highest Yielding Six-Month CD's FINANCIAL                    FINANCIAL  RATE    TELEPHONE INSTITUTION    LOCATION      RANKING*   PAID      NUMBER CitiSavings    San Antonio,     107     8.38%  512-650-3735                  Texas Benjamin       Houston, Texas     8     8.35   713-940-6700   Franklin Barclays Bank  New York, N.Y.   141     8.30   212-412-4000 New England    Wellesley, Mass. 162     8.25   617-239-3300   FSB Guardian Bank  Hempstead, N.Y.    1     8.25   516-538-6000 *200-300=superior  165-199=excellent  125-164=average   50-124=below average    1- 49=lowest    Sources: Banxquote; IDC Financial Publishing Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
