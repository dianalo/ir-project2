Just days ago, political strife in the Soviet Union hadWestern businesses feeling decidedly cool toward investingthere. But the rapidness with which this week's coup fizzledhas made some Western investors ready not only to resumeearlier plans but indeed to intensify them.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're more optimistic than ever,&quot; says James Lewis,chairman of Commstruc International, a closely held Vestal,N.Y., company that is preparing to build a wireless phonesystem in the republic of Byelorussia.   &quot;Business will be better over the long term now that thehard-liners have made their play and lost,&quot; predicts Edgar L.Brown Jr., president of Bell Atlantic Corp.'s European unit,who earlier this week was one of many who were puttingnegotiations on hold. If the U.S. gives a green light fortravel, he says, he expects to send a delegation back to theSoviet Union as early as next week to resume talks on varioustelecommunications ventures.   &quot;I think the unfolding of the coup cleared the air andeverything in the future will be gung-ho,&quot; says Robert L.Parker Sr., chairman and chief executive officer of ParkerDrilling Co., Tulsa, Okla. Mr. Parker notes that BorisYeltsin, the Russian republic president who gained politicalclout during this week's turmoil, has been preaching the needto develop oil and gas reserves. His strengthened hand lookshopeful for Parker, which three months ago began a Sovietjoint-venture drilling program in Western Siberia, Mr. Parkersays.   Tetra Pak Group, the giant Swedish-Swiss packaging andfood processing concern, says it expects to accelerate workon a spate of food distribution projects in the U.S.S.R.&quot;We're extremely optimistic and will do whatever we can tospeed up several projects we have planned in the Soviet Unionand in the Baltic republics,&quot; a company spokesman says.   To be sure, many companies got a jolt from the attemptedcoup, and they say the roar of tanks is still echoing intheir ears.   Westinghouse Electric Corp. has two planned Soviet ventureprojects -- one producing transport refrigerator equipmentfor trucks and the other modernizing the country's airtraffic control system. Neither is up and running. Thecompany says it took the position when the coup began -- andstill believes -- that it is premature to speculate whatimpact it will have.   PPG Industries Inc., which is studying joint ventures inthe Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, says it doesn't thinkits position is any different today than a week ago. &quot;Are wemore bullish now? No. Obviously more progress needs to bemade there,&quot; a spokesman says.   Eastman Kodak Co., Generale de Banque S.A. of Belgium andauto makers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. also saythey're sticking with their wait-and-see stance.   &quot;Every day the political situation is changing,&quot; says FordMotor spokeswoman Lin Cummings. Ford's four-year, $41 milliondeal to sell diesel engines to Soviet auto maker Moskvich isstill on, but the first shipment of 72 engines isn't due tobe shipped until the end of this month. Ford officials saythey will wait until then to decide what to do.   But at the same time, other companies are rushing to bookflights and hotels to accelerate Soviet business plans, eventhough large obstacles -- both political and economic --remain.   &quot;Some of our people are hopping on planes this week,&quot; saysAnthony Easton, chairman of San Mateo, Calif.-based Roscom, aSoviet-American joint venture that provides fax, electronicmail, telephone and other business telecommunication servicesbetween the two nations. &quot;We hope to expand as rapidly as wecan.&quot;   &quot;The failure of the coup has accelerated free enterprise{opportunities}&quot; in the Soviet Union, says John Lisanti,chairman of American International Golf Resorts, a MarinCounty, Calif., developer that is building the Soviet Union'sfirst golf course, which will be outside Moscow -- a projectthat was conceived 15 years ago. Now that the hard-liners arelikely to be &quot;thrown out, foreign business people will have amuch better chance in Russia,&quot; he says.   &quot;My feeling is that businessmen will go ahead and notwait&quot; for all outstanding economic issues to be resolved,says William Newman, assistant general manager of London'sMoscow Narodny Bank, which plays a leading role in foreigninvestment in the Soviet Union. &quot;A lot of people will want toget in early, although not many contracts may be signed rightaway.&quot;   Right after the coup, U.S. accounting giant KPMG PeatMarwick put three major projects with the Soviet Union onice, says Nina Dimas, the accounting firm's U.S.S.R. programmanager. &quot;But now we're going ahead full steam,&quot; says Ms.Dimas, who is flying to Moscow next Tuesday to lead 30 U.S.and European businesses on a &quot;defense and aerospace businesstour&quot; of Russia. Despite the turmoil, not one of the 30companies has dropped out of the tour, she points out.   Ernst andamp; Young, the biggest U.S. accounting firm, which hashad a 32-person office in Moscow, has just set up a New Yorkhot line to help its clients and prospective clients gaugeprospects for doing business in Russia.   Filmmakers are keener than ever to make movies in theSoviet Union now that the coup appears to have a happyHollywood ending. &quot;I certainly feel more confident going toRussia today than before the failed coup, simply because wehave now seen the worst,&quot; says Robert Cooper, senior vicepresident at HBO Pictures. On Monday, HBO Pictures wasscrambling to move a chunk of the production of &quot;Stalin,&quot; aminiseries starring Robert Duvall slated to begin shooting inthe Kremlin, to Hungary. Now, plans are back on to film inthe Soviet Union. The division of Home Box Office, TimeWarner Inc.'s pay cable service, is also going forward withplans to shoot part of another film, &quot;Comrades of Summer,&quot; inMoscow's Red Square.   Perhaps not surprisingly, U.S. banks, while optimistic,remain cautious in light of the sad overall Soviet economicpicture. They say that the failed coup improves the prospectsfor them to increase lending in the Soviet Union but stressthat it won't happen overnight. &quot;We'll have to see economicprogress,&quot; says Paul McGonagle, senior vice president incharge of international risk management at First ChicagoCorp. &quot;Once the political-military questions are put to bed,there are still economic uncertainties. Hopefully, those willbe more easily resolved with more political clarity.&quot;   U.S. banks had only $257 million of exposure inunguaranteed credits to the Soviet Union as of March 31, outof a total world-wide bank exposure of roughly $20 billion,Mr. McGonagle says.   William Rhoades, vice chairman of Citicorp, adds: &quot;Banksare going to insist on a comprehensive economic plan that isrealistic and has the blessing of international financialinstitutions, including the IMF and the World Bank.&quot; Whenthat happens, they will more likely step forward forshort-term trade financing and eventually loan commitmentsfor oil and gas ventures and other joint ventures involvingU.S. corporations. Among areas that have to be resolved foroil and gas financing, however, are whether the Soviet Unionor the individual republics have the property rights, headds.   &quot;These reforms,&quot; Mr. Rhoades says, &quot;will take time.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
