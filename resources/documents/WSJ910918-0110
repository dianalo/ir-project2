Mrs. Schilling and her dozen or so colleagues are enrolledin a 10-day, $1,000 field course offered by Toronto's YorkUniversity and held in places like this: a dank, dark cavefilled with thousands of screeching live bats and a few deadones. None in the group minded getting a rabies vaccination,bathing in insect repellent (the bugs are terrible) or havingbats crawl up their shirtsleeves. They are here to beenlightened about the virtues of this much-maligned mammal ofthe night.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Can I pick up this dead bat without getting anything?&quot;the 44-year-old woman from Falls Church, Va., asks Prof.Brock Fenton, a leading bat ecologist and this expedition'sleader. &quot;Sure,&quot; he replies, &quot;as long as you don't lick it.&quot;(He's kidding.)   For a nocturnal animal, the bat is fast becoming thecreature &quot;du jour.&quot; Beyond this gathering of graduatestudents and biologists are thousands of other bat fanciers:home owners, environmentalists and scientists in the U.S. andabroad. They all have a stake in bats.   In Ireland, for example, bats are selling houses. Anewspaper article reports: &quot;Attic conversions are so passe.Bats not bunks are high on the priority lists ofhouse-hunting snobs.&quot; &quot;You see,&quot; it goes on, &quot;bats tend topick castles and mansions for their summer breeding roosts.&quot;They also pick &quot;period guesthouses.&quot;   In Spain, Mary Ann and Gunther Kunkel are trying this:&quot;Medium sized house on two floors&quot; for sale . . . &quot;2nd flooradjacent to wide terrace (ideal for bats and bat watchers).&quot;The advertisement includes last year's top bat count: &quot;about650.&quot; Mrs. Kunkel says that so far most of the people whohave come to look at the $94,000 house have been&quot;unsuitable.&quot; &quot;We have to find people who like wildlife,&quot; sheexplains.   More often, though, it's bat houses that are being sold.They are a lot like birdhouses, with no floor. Bats fly upinto the dark, warm shelters and hang upside down. &quot;Plow andamp;Hearth,&quot; a mail-order catalog of country goods, says thisyear's sales of bat houses should reach 5,000, up from about300 in l986. Heidi Hughes, who runs a bird-supply store inRockville, Md., lends further evidence: Sales of her $22 and$49 bat-roost kits have jumped 300% in three years. Is someof this increase due to the popularity of the movie &quot;Batman&quot;?Yes, she says, adding, &quot;Some people see the houses as anovelty, like that pet rock thing.&quot;   But the pet rock didn't do much. The average bat cangobble up 600 mosquitoes and other pests in an hour. For manypeople wary of pesticides, it pays to nail a bat house totheir own house and let the critters dine al fresco. &quot;I'mglad to see the bats show up at dusk,&quot; says Tom Dygard, ownerof an organic herb and edible-flower farm in Zionsville, Ind.&quot;It only takes four or five mosquitoes to make my eveningsmiserable.&quot;   All this attention is helping to demythologize the bat.For one, fewer than half of 1% of all bats carry rabies. Foranother, the vampire bat is found mainly in Latin and SouthAmerica and prefers cow's blood to human's, Bram Stoker'sfamous novel &quot;Dracula&quot; notwithstanding.   Moreover, bats are not rodents: They are more closelyrelated to monkeys than mice. There are more than 1,000species, accounting for about 25% of all mammals, and theycome in all sizes. Nor do bats land on people's heads and gettangled up in their hair: Bats use high-frequency sounds tonavigate, and this echolocation allows them to steer clear ofeven something as fine as hair.   Good bat PR is coming none too soon. More than 40% ofthose in the U.S. are now endangered species. Pesticides andvandalism in bat caves are largely responsible. In thePacific islands and Southeast Asia, some flying fox bats areextinct. &quot;People chop them up, bones and all, into hamburgerpatties,&quot; laments Merlin D. Tuttle, founder of BatConservation International. (Bats can be stewed, too. Throwthem into a pot with coconut milk.)   Ecology aside, some homeowners aren't thrilled with thebats in their own belfries. Maribel Swasy, this reporter'smother, has tried for more than four decades to evict a batcolony from the attic of her 106-year-old farmhouse attic inBlairsville, Pa. She put on a new roof, added new windows andhad the chimney sealed, all to little avail. &quot;As long as theystay in their part of the house, I don't really mind,&quot; saysthe 70-year-old retired nurse. &quot;It's just when I have toshare my bed with them that I get a little upset.&quot; (She oncefound one snoozing between her sheets.)   Scientists say there are new medical reasons to respectbats. Stephen J. Gardell, a biochemist at Merck Sharp andamp;Dohme, a research lab in West Point, Pa., has found an agentin vampire-bat saliva that could dissolve blood clots inhumans.   He says that rather than having to &quot;wrestle with livevampires&quot; to get them to drool into a test tube, scientistskill the bats and then suck the saliva out with a syringe.&quot;They do have sharp teeth,&quot; says Mr. Gardell.   Melanie Watt, a University of Toronto graduate student,prefers to work with live bats for her research on the DNA inbat blood. By studying the DNA, she hopes to explain why batsreturn to the same roosts for decades.   But now Ms. Watt is sitting in the glow of a Colemanlantern, near the cave entrance with the other members of Mr.Fenton's bat class. She helps in the blood letting of &quot;Myotislucifugus,&quot; or little brown bat. &quot;Sometimes you have to dobat aerobics to keep the blood circulating,&quot; she tells TomValega, of the National Institutes of Health, who holds thebat while she inserts a needle and exercises the wing to makethe bat donate more generously. &quot;You get a little warpedafter handling 400 bats,&quot; she says.   This isn't something to try in your backyard. Bats do bitewhen they are handled, so nocturnal neophytes are encouragedto wear thick leather gloves. Drinking wine before heading tothe cave also helps the spirits; David Johnston, a museumdirector from Saratoga, Calif., selects a Pinot Noir, 1990for this evening's picnic supper. &quot;I haven't had this muchfun on a trip in a long time,&quot; he says.   Most of the students say curiosity about bats brought themto camp. &quot;I collect dead things,&quot; confides Sue Smith, astudent at Humboldt State University in Arcata, Calif. AddsMr. Johnston: &quot;I'm surprised we don't have a psychologistamong us to study people who study bats.&quot;   To study the mammals, the bats have to be captured. Batdetectors -- receivers that pick up the bats' chirps -- helpspot them in a cave. The easiest way to catch a lot of batsis to set a &quot;Tuttle Trap,&quot; a device named after the founderof the bat conservation group. The trap, made from two metalframes strung with fishing line, catches bats as they fly.   After capture, each bat is wrapped in a sheer knee-highstocking (black stockings are &quot;too kinky,&quot; Mr. Fenton says),which makes them look like little egg rolls. They are weighedand tagged with a number. As the students work, they seemoblivious to the hundreds of bats that swoop around theirheads. &quot;Look at all this traffic,&quot; gushes Mr. Fenton. &quot;Theaverage person would find this distressing, but I think it'sgreat.&quot;   He hopes his students will continue to share hisboosterism after the course ends. &quot;They should go out andtalk to the Rotary Club about bats,&quot; he says.   Of all the members of his class, Mrs. Schilling is thetrue convert. She attended Bat 101 to please her husband,Steve, a bat-loving computer specialist with theEnvironmental Protection Agency. But she grew to love theseodd creatures. And what will she do with the many photographsshe took of her furry friends on this odd vacation? &quot;We'llput them in our Christmas cards this year,&quot; she says.</TEXT></DOC>
