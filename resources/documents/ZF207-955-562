(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Metzler, Douglas P.; Haas, Stephanie W.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A shallow syntactic parser, the Constituent Object Parser (COP),is developed which uses syntactic information to improve theperformance of information retrieval.andP;  The fact that people gaininformation from the meanings of the individual words in a text aswell as the structure implies that the use of syntacticinformation in addition to query context might improve the searchprocess.andP;  COP produces dependency tree representations ofsyntactic structure for more exact specification of intendedmeanings of a sentence than key terms are capable of.andP;  The parseruses syntax as a back-end filter by using syntax to analyzecandidate query matches obtained by conventional informationretrieval, and then to represent structural representations of howsingle-word terms have been used.andP;  Design, functioning,applications and ambiguity handling of COP are described.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Information Storage and RetrievalSyntax AnalyzersParsingTheoretical ResearchNew TechniqueArtificial IntelligenceLanguage ProcessingQuery ProcessingText Data Bases.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Noun phrase dependency trees.
