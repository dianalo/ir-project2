In a petition filed with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, All-Tech Investment Group Inc. and threeindividual investors want to scrap a rule that prohibitsmembers from entering orders on behalf of a &quot;professionaltrading account.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The petition comes as the NASD plans to expand thisdefinition under its small-order execution system, or SOES,which automatically executes orders of as many as 1,000shares, so that investors don't have to call market makers.   The NASD wants to redefine professional trading accountsas those, among other things, with &quot;excessive frequency&quot; ofshort-term trading and short sales, or sales of borrowedstock that is later bought back and returned to the lender.Currently, SOES professional trading accounts are defined asthose in which five or more trades are executed a day.   Professional traders such as All-Tech frequently haveclashed with OTC market makers by automatically executingmultiple trades before a market maker can update prices ofthe stock to reflect market conditions. And some regulatorshave alleged that these professional traders -- derisivelycalled &quot;SOES bandits&quot; and &quot;electronic highwaymen&quot; -- aremaking it more difficult for small investors to get fair andefficient pricing of their stocks.   But All-Tech and other investors are fighting back. TheNASD proposal is &quot;the first step in an attempt to developdiscriminatory, arbitrary and improper limitations uponSOES,&quot; the investors allege in their SEC petition.   NASD officials were traveling yesterday and couldn't bereached for comment.   But Sam Scott Miller, a lawyer for All-Tech, says the NASDis simply trying to protect its member firms, not smallinvestors.   &quot;The NASD's SOES will not withstand scrutiny beyond itsfacade,&quot; Mr. Miller said in a separate letter to the SEC.&quot;Designed as a showpiece for automatically effecting smallsecurities transactions, any use of this machine has beengreeted by sand in its gears thrown by those who feel theirfranchises threatened.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
