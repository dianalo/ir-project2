Rio Algom, which last year broke off talks to acquireDallas-based Uranium Resources for $2.55 a share, said itbought 2.1 million Uranium Resources shares for $1.50 each,or a total of about $3.1 million, from Elders ResourcesFinance Inc., a New York-based unit of Elders Resources Ltd.of New Zealand.</LP><TEXT>   Rio Algom said it also paid Elders Resources $2.5 million,or 35 cents each, for warrants to acquire an additional 7.1million Uranium Resources shares. The warrants, if exercised,would give Rio Algom a fully diluted stake of about 25% inUranium Resources. The warrants are exercisable at $1.25 eachuntil March 1992.   A Rio Algom spokesman said the company held furtheracquisition talks with Uranium Resources management lastmonth but that these also were unsuccessful. He said RioAlgom offered a lower price this time of between $1.50 and$2.55 for each Uranium Resources share.   Uranium Resources said it considers the value of thecompany to be &quot;substantially greater&quot; than what Rio Algom wasoffering. &quot;We have elected not to pursue further discussionswith Rio at this time because of the apparently widediscrepancy in values placed on the company,&quot; a companystatement said.   Rio Algom, which is 52%-owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain,said it may seek further meetings with Uranium Resourcesmanagement to discuss acquiring the company.</TEXT></DOC>
