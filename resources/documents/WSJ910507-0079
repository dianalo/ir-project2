Such an exceptionallylong period of rising output and employment left the countrywith enormous cumulative gains that will be barely dented bywhat appears to be a mild downturn.   From trough to peak, real GNP rose 32%, or 4.2% per year.That means the entire U.S. economy, including government,grew by nearly one-third in fewer than nine years. The outputof nonfinancial corporations grew even faster, by 38.6% overnine years -- an annual rate of 5%.</LP><TEXT>   The Federal Reserve's index of manufacturing productiongrew faster still -- by 6.3% a year -- yielding an awesometotal increase of 48.3%. All the talk about the&quot;deindustrialization of America&quot; turns out to have been notonly false but ludicrous. The near-doubling of exports, inreal terms, over those nine years is equally at odds withconventional unwisdom about an alleged loss of&quot;competitiveness.&quot; Indeed, it is quite unlikely that exportshave peaked, even now.   What happened to investment is more controversial. Totalprivate investment was up more than 71%, despite earlycutbacks in housing and nonresidential construction.Producers' durable equipment, which studies by Larry Summersand others have shown to be particularly vital to economicgrowth, was up 76.3%.   To make such a big number look small, some economistswould have us believe that most of the increased investmentwas eaten away by depreciation, leaving little improvement inthe &quot;net&quot; capital stock. There are complex conceptual andmeasurement problems with that argument. The quality ofcapital equipment, for example, cannot be measured by thenumber of dollars spent. Replacing a depreciated electrictypewriter with a similarly priced computer may not add adollar to &quot;net investment,&quot; but it certainly generates morevaluable goods and services.   The evidence contradicts the pessimistic claim that theinvestment boom yielded little &quot;net&quot; improvement in thenation's capital stock. Since manufacturing output rose bymore than 48%, and exports by nearly 93%, there must havebeen substantial investments in added capacity to generateall that added production. U.S. production of businessequipment last September was nearly 76% higher than it hadbeen in 1983, and imports of capital goods have exceededimports of consumer goods since 1987. It surpassescredibility to believe that most of the new machinery thatwas produced or imported in recent years is now all worn out,or &quot;depreciated,&quot; leaving little &quot;net&quot; improvement.   Farm income is not included in the graph, because farmingdoes not simply follow the overall ups and downs of theoverall economy. The trough for farmers was 1983, not 1982,and the most recent peak appears to have been in the firstquarter of last year, dipping slightly since then. In thefirst quarter of 1990, real net farm income was up 188% fromthe deeply depressed average of 1983, but also up 125% from1980.   Government certainly grew too. However, like farming, thetiming of government activities does not quite match theoverall cycle. Measured in constant 1982 dollars, federal taxreceipts soared by 36.8% between fiscal 1983 and fiscal 1989.So much for the canard that lower tax rates starved thecentral government. Purchases by state and local governmentsgrew by 30.2%. Before last year's increases in federal andstate taxes, real after-tax income per person (which hadrisen only 7.5% from 1973 through 1980) had risen by 19.2%from 1980 through the first quarter of 1990.   Another statistic that tracks a different cycle is laborproductivity. Indeed, productivity rose during 1981-82, as itdid in previous recessions and will again this year. Whenproductivity in nonfinancial corporate business reached itscharacteristically early cyclical peak, at the end of 1988,it was up 14.1% from 1980. When considered alongside the hugeand important increase in employment of millions ofless-skilled new workers, the combination of a 25% increasein hours of work, plus more output per hour, was really quitean achievement.   A unique feature of this expansion was the enormous growthof small entrepreneurial ventures, indicated by an increaseof nearly two-thirds in the real income of nonfarmproprietors. It is difficult to imagine this burst ofindividual creativity and enterprise occurring were it notfor the sharp reduction in marginal tax rates on individualincome and, until 1987, on capital gains.   The unusually rapid increase in the number of peopleseeking and finding jobs is likewise surely attributable tothe improvement in after-tax rewards. The percentage of theworking-age population with jobs had hovered around 58%-59%from 1966 to 1983. It soared to 63.4% by early 1990. Back in1980, the Labor Department's intermediate projection was thatthe civilian labor force would be 119.3 million in 1990. Theactual labor forced turned out to be 124.8 million, 4.6%higher than expected. Despite this unexpected surge in thenumber of eager job seekers, the unemployment rate is lowertoday -- in the middle of a recession -- than it was in allbut two of the years from 1975 through 1986.   There were 19.3 million more people working at the peak ofthe job cycle than at the end of 1982, an increase of 19.5%.And nearly all of these added workers are still working,despite the recession. Hours of work rose even more than thenumber of jobs, by 25.3%, as more people became willing towork overtime, or as self-employed proprietors, or at secondjobs.   Those who spent the past decade telling us that&quot;Reaganomics&quot; could not possibly succeed are still mystifiedby what happened, so they employ remarkable ingenuity andself-deception in trying to deny that it happened at all.Even now, we still hear such critics leaning on suchelementary fallacies as complaining about the increase inhousehold debts, while ignoring altogether the largerincrease in both real and financial assets.   There are several statistical tricks favored by those whosearch in vain for ways to denigrate what was obviously thesecond longest and strongest expansion on record. The mostcommon device is to compare 1980-89 with 1970-79, since the1980s (unlike the 1970s) began with three tough years, as wewrestled with runaway inflation and brutal taxation. Even ifwe switch to 1980 as a base for comparison, though, real GNPhad nonetheless increased 30.8% by the third quarter of 1990,and manufacturing output was still up by 41%. No amount ofstatistical gamesmanship can make gains of that magnitudedisappear.   Another common trick is compare annual rates of changewith previous, much shorter, cycles -- as though thedurability of an expansion makes no difference whatsoever.The inflationary 36-month 1971-73 expansion, and the similar58-month 1975-80 expansion, did indeed show rapid annualrates of increase in certain data -- especially prices andinventories. But a 4.2% rate of economic growth over 92months adds up to a lot more real output, income andaccumulated wealth than any conceivable rate of growth over36 or 58 months.   Facts are often politically inconvenient, but the factsabout this expansion just won't go away. Call it dumb luck orsmart policies, the prolonged U.S.-led expansion of 1983-1990must go down in the history books as one of the mostimpressive economic performances on record.   ---   Mr. Reynolds is director of economic research at theHudson Institute in Indianapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
