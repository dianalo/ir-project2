After the selection of a proposalfor funding, DOE may, if necessary, enter into negotiations with a proposerprior to the award of a contract. Such negotiations are not a commitmentthat DOE will make an award. Resultant contracts will be subject to theapplicable portions of the Federal Acquisition and Department of EnergyAcquisition Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A</ITAG>The Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) program has establishedtwo complementary overall goals supporting increased utilization of domesticfossil fuel resources. These program goals are: (1) Increase the contributionof coal by improving environmental, technical, and economic performanceand by increasing the areas of application and flexibility of coal-basedsystems; and (2) increase the effective resource base for premium gas andliquid fuels through enhanced resource recovery and/or production of liquidand gaseous fuel analogs from coal, shale, and tar sands. The METC programintends to pursue research opportunities in the utilization and extractionof domestic fossil fuel resources that are of high-risk and long-term characteristics.The METC program incorporates basic and applied research that is coupledto advance research activities needed to improve the understanding of scientificfundamentals and engineering process applications.
