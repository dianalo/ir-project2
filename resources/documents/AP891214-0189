MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The search for the elusive peace dividend isunder way, and in an election year, with the Cold War thawing, thegovernment is going to have to deliver one in 1990. After watchingthe Berlin Wall come apart, the voters are likely to insist ondefense cuts more drastic than the administration deems wise.   Even though Pentagon planners say real savings are not likely toflow from events in the Soviet Union and its freed satellites untillater, the peace dividend is too politically appealing to bepostponed.   ``When the tide's here, we're not going to be able to shovel itback out to sea, either,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. Heforecasts major cuts but worries that some may be premature.   A Republican senator suggests the Pentagon should recall thewords of Alexander Ladru-Rollin, a leader in the French revolutionof 1848: ``There go the people. I must follow them, for I am theirleader.''   Reduced defense spending next year will have more to do with thedemands of deficit reduction and with plans that already were inplace than with the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe and the armscuts now under negotiation with the Soviet Union.   The budget benefits that flow from those changes will comelater, in 1991 and beyond, Pentagon planners say. But patient,cautious business as usual won't satisfy the political demands ofthe year ahead.   ``We can talk in neat terms of threat strategy, translated intodollars in the budget, but outside the halls of Congress are somevery active constituents in growing large numbers,'' said Sen. JohnW. Warner, R-Va. ``And unless we have a real tight ... partnershipwith the president, predicated on sound, real-time information, wemight see that constituency get way out ahead of both the leadersin the executive branch and the legislative branch.''   Warner made that observation at a Senate Armed ServicesCommittee hearing last week. Senate Democratic leaders have askedthat panel and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to considerthe changes in the Communist bloc and weigh their impact onspending.   The new year will bring dozens of congressional inquiries inboth House and Senate as lawmakers look at potential savings anddebate what to do with the money.   That debate may produce more sound than substance. At the end ofevery war, hot or cold, there's a wave of optimistic speculationabout what will be done with the resources that no longer have tobe spent on the military. The results don't match the expectations,sometimes because of postwar recessions, sometimes because themoney has to go to old, unmet needs or to new ones that stem fromthe conflict just ended.   Former President Ford says any money freed by the easing of theCold War should go directly into deficit reduction, not into newfederal spending.   President Bush has said that would be his plan. But he also hassaid it is premature to be talking about a peace dividend.   Ford said there wasn't any after the Vietnam War. He said it wasabsorbed by federal spending. It also was absorbed by a soaringinflation rate.   ``We really never saw any beneficial result with the cutback ... after Vietnam,'' he said at an American Enterprise Instituteforum. ``It scares me that we'll make the same serious error whenit comes to whatever dividend you get.''   President Bush is expected to propose a $292 billion Pentagonbudget for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, less than thelast administration budget sought, but more than Congress actuallyapproved for the current budget year. Not much dividend there.   The administration warns that changes in the East and arms cutspromised by Moscow are incomplete and reversible. ``If we attemptto pocket too quickly the benefits that we anticipate, then we riskundercutting the very strategy that has brought us to the brink ofsuccess,'' Paul G. Wolfowitz, undersecretary of defense, told theSenate hearing.   Wolfowitz said he'd plead guilty to caution, and that thePentagon can foresee more substantial cuts in four or five years.   With department stores selling chunks of the Berlin Wall as $10Christmas gifts, caution and patience are going to be hard tomaintain.   ``Unless we're able to predicate our budget upon soundintelligence, sound planning, then we're not going to be able tohold a line,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine. ``Constituentswill demand that we make massive or substantial reductions wellbeyond what might be militarily prudent.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
