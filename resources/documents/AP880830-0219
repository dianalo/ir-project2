Reynolds Tobacco Co. will be test-marketed in St. Louis,Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., beginning Oct. 1, company officials saidtoday.   The new cigarettes, called Premier, will be odorless and willgenerate only a trace of ash or smoke that could irritate peoplenearby, the officials said.   Company officials said the new cigarettes contain a high-techpacket of tobacco extracts which is heated, but not burned.   The price per pack will be about 30 cents higher than othercigarettes, said Betsy Annese, director of public relations for theWinston-Salem-based company.   The company will use a variety of advertising messages to sellthe new cigarettes, she said; one advertising approach will toutthe new product as ``Premier _ the Cleaner Smoke.''   But the company is not making any health or safety claims.   ``We're not claiming this is a safe or safer cigarette,'' shesaid.   A health claim would invite regulation by the Federal Food andDrug Administration.   ``If a product is sold with claims to make cigarettes safer, itis a medical device'' subject to FDA approval, said William Grigg,an FDA spokesman.   Anti-smoking groups are pressing the FDA to regulate the newcigarettes as a drug because, they maintain, Reynolds is makingimplied health claims for its product. In addition, theanti-smoking groups say the new cigarettes could appeal toteen-agers, thereby gaining a new generation of smokers ascustomers.   Analysts said Reynolds selected the test markets, in particularthe Arizona cities, because they have numerous older, sophisticatedsmokers who may be trying to quit smoking or are seeking analternative.</TEXT></DOC>
