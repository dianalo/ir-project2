 The subtitle of the session raised a relevant question: &quot;Goodfor business or just cute?&quot;andM;&quot;In case you think multimedia is cheap,&quot; he said, pointing to a piece ofequipment in the front of the room, &quot;that projector cost $11,000!&quot;andM;&quot;Most people think multimedia consists of combined video, animation,conferencing, voice annotation, [etc.].andP;  To have that, you have to go wellbeyond standard platforms.&quot;andM;What multimedia really is: &quot;Compound information processing, and an explosiveplethora of applications destined to unravel all system architectures, fromoperating systems to LANs to DBMS to spreadsheets.&quot;andP;  It provides the userwith a capability to &quot;process information in a different way.&quot;andM;Example: Insurance companies can completely process an accident claim on aterminal.andP;  They have access to hand written notes and photographs of theaccident scene -- all on the terminal.andP;  No piece of paper is needed -- orfiled.andM;&quot;The computer is the medium!&quot;andP;  &quot;People can absorb large amounts of data --quickly!&quot;andM;The markets and applications include:andM;* education/training -- including instructions for maintenanceandM;* business desktop -- modeling, presentations, advertising, publishing,hyper-anything (information management)andM;* industrial -- manufacturing, sales,medicalandM;* consumer -- entertainment and educationandM;* kiosks -- point of sale aids, sales support toolsandM;&quot;Kiosks is the fastest growing segment.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: This is an application that was not possible before multimediapresentation and hyper-data searches became available.andP;  Some good exampleswere demonstrated.andP;  See below.andM;To drive home his point that multimedia is expensive, he displayed someprices: A 386-size PC is available for about $3,000.andP;  If you add everythingneeded to give it minimal monochrome multimedia capability, the price jumpsto $12,400.andP;  But...andP;  only three years ago, that same equipment would havecost $25,500.andP;  Conclusion: It's expensive, but it's getting cheaper.andM;Before you get too excited, he also pointed out that once you have that$12,400 multimedia system, you will quickly want more memory, a video board,authoring software, and other peripherals that will increase the cost to$26,600 -- which is still about half the cost of three years ago.andM;&quot;Prices will fall at an accelerated rate.&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Wasner introduced representatives from three companies.andP;  Each used that$11,000 projector to demonstrate their multimedia system.andM;1.andP;  Price WaterhouseandM;To satisfy a training need, Price Waterhouse had a multimedia training coursedeveloped.andP;  It is an interactive video that teaches auditors how toinvestigate a computerized system.andP;  &quot;It's a boring subject.&quot;andP;  The video makesit interesting.andP;  The course -- which lasts from 5 to 10 hours depending onthe individual student's speed -- looks like fun.andP;  It provides &quot;in-depthtraining.&quot;andM;The package took almost 1.5 years to develop -- which is an indicator of cost-- but now it can be sent to any of its worldwide offices and can be usedrepeatedly.andP;  It is a mandatory course for auditors, optional for itsmanagement.andM;It was a very impressive demonstration.andP;  When students enjoy being trained,they learn quickly and well.andM;2.andP;  Aquidneck Management Associates, Ltd.andM;This company, &quot;a strategic partner of IBM,&quot; produced an interactive videotraining course for the National Linen Service.andP;  Again, it deals with &quot;aboring subject,&quot; the 27 volumes of the company's manuals.andP;  The titleindicates the contents: &quot;The Branch Operating Support System.&quot;andM;The developers &quot;took off-the-shelf applications and worked them into thesolution.&quot;andP;  &quot;It is an electronic operational manual that mimics what theusers are used to.andP;  It uses hyper-text to get to the page that is wanted.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: That explains the problem with this package.andP;  It is abook-on-a-screen.andP;  Period.andP;  Oh, they threw in a video library capability tomake it a little sexy, but it lacks the imagination of the Price Waterhousepackage.andP;  Using this system, you can get to the right page faster than if youthumbed through the 27 volumes, but is that enough to warrant the cost?andM;3.andP;  Competitive SolutionsandM;This company is another &quot;IBM business partner.&quot;andP;  It produces multimediapackages for large corporations.andP;  The packages utilize digitized photographs(stills) and audio.andP;  Three packages were demonstrated:andM;First -- produced for a Danish Real Estate companyandM;The package investigates the clients loan limitations and matches them toestimated costs (including closing costs, legal fees, taxes, etc.).andP;  Thatdetermines the client's spending range.andM;Next, the client's demands are recorded (number of bedrooms, location, style,etc.).andP;  The package searches the files, selects candidates, and displaysresults -- including photographs of the house and the surrounding area.andM;The package can be used from a remote site.andP;  The selection criteria can bedetermined by phone.andP;  The package can then (a) produce a video tape of thedisplays, or (b) hard copy displays which can be sent to the clients.andP;  Thedisplays can be sent via FAX -- making this a real-time system.andM;NOTE: This is an example of a &quot;kiosk&quot; application.andM;Second -- produced for Paramount PicturesandM;Paramount has a library of short film clips -- scenes of countries, cities,disasters, etc.andP;  -- that are available to directors for inclusion inproductions.andP;  Searching that library is a monumental task!andM;This package searches the library for the user.andP;  Search criteria arespecified to the system.andP;  The resulting display is three stills from eachclip found: first, middle, and final frame.andP;  That is usually sufficient forthe director to make a decision.andM;Third -- produced for a European travel agencyandM;The clients enter their search criteria -- example: skiing in the Alps -- thesystem displays enticing pictures of happy people skiing in the Alps and thenpresents a variety of vacation possibilities.andP;  It is a mini-travelogue.andP;  Andit can be narrated in the European language of the client's choice.andM;The displays have strong appeal!andP;  They are colorful, interesting -- it is asexy sell!andM;This was another example of a &quot;kiosk&quot; application.andM;All three of the company's demonstrations were excellent.andP;  They proved that alittle imagination can produce big business.andM;To answer the question: Multimedia is good for business!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
