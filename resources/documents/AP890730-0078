Judge Sarah Curley also said the examiner would study the meritsof the company's proposed reorganization plan.   She said in a decision released Friday that she found no ``unityof action'' to protect the interests of the bondholders, who soughtthe appointment of an examiner.   ``We can bring to light the facts and circumstances regardingserious allegations,'' said Andrew Friedman, an attorneyrepresenting a group of bondholders who are suing AmericanContinental in California.   The bondholders allege that company insiders, including ChairmanCharles H Keating Jr., conspired to defraud investors.   Mrs. Curley directed the bondholders' attorneys to meet withofficials of the U.S. Trustee's Office regarding the choice of anexaminer and the scope of the investigation. Friedman said he hopesto report to the court within 10 days.   Attorneys for American Continental opposed the appointment of anexaminer.   The added burden of an examiner would ``push this debtor intoliquidation,'' Terese Mosher-Beluris, an attorney for AmericanContinental, said during hearings Thursday.   On April 13, the company and 11 subsidiaries of Lincoln Savingsand Loan Association, its principal holding, filed for Chapter 11bankruptcy protection. A day later, federal regulators took overmanagement of the $5.4 billion Sandamp;L.   James Feder, an attorney representing American Continental, saidhe did not know whether American Continental would appeal Mrs.Curley's decision.</TEXT></DOC>
