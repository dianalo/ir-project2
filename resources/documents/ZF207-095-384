(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Stark, Craig L.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>POWER USER The advanced macro features in WordPerfect, Version 5.0, areseriously underdocumented.andP;  It's a shame because when properly applied, theyprovide a great deal of extra power and flexibility.andM;While writing a book on WordPerfect macros for Bantam Computer Books, I foundthat one of the least understood macro features is the [ *P] display code,which is used to place a message anywhere on the screen.andP;  The [ *P] code isused in [PROMPT], [TEXT], and [CHAR] message strings, and it is followed bytwo characters.andP;  The first character indicates a column position (from 1 to80); the second character indicates a line position (from 1 to 24).andP;  Byjudiciously calculating the column and line positions, you can produce pop-upmenus of any size or shape.andM;The [ *P] display code uses either control characters (*A, *B, *C, and soforth), or the IBM Extended Character Set characters those with an ASCIIvalue of 128 or more).andP;  The control character method is not recommended, asit precludes putting the start of the message at some locations on thescreen.andP;  The better method is to use the Extended Character Set.andP;  Enter theappropriate column and line characters by holding down the Alt key and typinga number into the numeric keypad (not the number keys on the top row of thekeyboard).andP;  For example, to enter ASCII 128, press and hold the Alt key, andtype 1 2 8 on the numeric keypad.andP;  The C character will appear.andM;You need to identify both the column and line after the [ P] code, so youmust enter two codes.andP;  The column code goes first, followed by the line code.andO;For example, to position the message at the upper-left corner of the display(ASCII 128 for the column and ASCII 128 for the line), enter [ P]CC Yourmessage goes here.andP;  [is approx.]andM;To determine the proper ASCII number to use for other locations, add 127 tothe desired column or line number.andP;  To place the message starting at column30 and line 15, for instance, use ASCII 157 (127 + 30) and ASCII 142 (127 +15).andP;  In the IBM extended character set these will show on-screen as yen(ASCII 157) and A (ASCII 142).andM;You can start the message anywhere along the width of the display, up tocolumn 80 (ASCII 207).andP;  After that, WordPerfect automatically wraps the startof the message onto the next line.andP;  Wrapping will also occur if the messageextends beyond the 80th column.andP;  Additionally, you can start the messagealong the length of the display up to line 25.andP;  Realistically, you would notuse the 25th line with the [ P] display code, however, since that's thestatus line used for WordPerfect message prompts.andM;A pop-up window is composed of separate lines in a [PROMPT], [TEXT], or[CHAR] message, and it has the effect of temporarily overwriting any textthat's underneath.andP;  Once the window is removed from the screen, the originaltext reappears.andP;  By formatting the lines of the message with a box frame, youcan make a realistic-looking pop-up window.andM;By way of illustration, Figure 1 contains a sample macro that displays apop-up window that allows you to select one of several Helvetica fonttypefaces (it's for use with a PostScript-compatible laser printer).andP;  Asecond, smaller box prompts for the point size of the font.andM;Text within the pop-up window is formatted using empty spaces.andP;  Each line ofthe window must end with an [Enter] code.andP;  Be sure that you use the properscreen locations after the [ P] code or your window will be literally&quot;shattered&quot;--with segments strewn all over the screen!andM;Sadly, you cannot use WordPerfect's Line Draw feature to make box frames foryour pop-up windows.andP;  You must create them in the macro editor yourself bydepressing Alt and typing a number on the numric keypad, or withWordPerfect's compose key.andM;When using the alt-key method, press the Alt key and a number on the keypadfor each segment of the frame.andP;  Use the Back-space and Delete keys to removeunwanted segments.andP;  When using the compose key method, press Ctrl-2, type thecode for the segment you want to use (don't forget the comma), and pressEnter.andP;  Repeat the process for each segment of the frame.andP;  Use the Backspaceand Delete keys to remove unwanted segments.--Gordon McComb; Canoga Park,CaliforniaandM;You can experiment with this macro even if your printer doesn't supportHelvetica.andP;  You'll just get the message &quot;Sorry, can't find the font&quot; at theend.andP;  Naturally you're free to modify POP-UP.WPM so it presents fontsavailable on your system.andM;POP-UP.WPM uses many advanced macro features, so you can't just enter it inMacro Definition mode.andP;  You must carefully construct it within the macroeditor.andP;  First, start an ordinary macro definition with the name POP-UP.andO;Enter a description, if you like, and immediately end the definition bypressing Ctrl-F10 again.andP;  Now define POP-UP once more--this time you'll get amessage inviting you to either replace the existing blank macro or edit it.andO;Select #2, Edit, and you're in the macro editor.andP;  Again select #2 to get intoediting the macro action.andM;From here on, you'll need to refer carefully to Figure 1.andP;  There are severalkinds of elements in the macro.andP;  Special commands, variables, and commandkeys appear in curly braces [].andP;  Everything else is ordinary text.andM;* To insert a special command, hit CtrlPgUp and select it from the menu.andM;* To insert a command key, press Ctrl-V followed by the key.andM;* To insert a variable, press Ctrl-V and Alt-n, where n is the number of thevariable.andM;* To insert ordinary text, just type it in.andM;Within the ordinary text, this macro uses six line-drawing characters tocreate boxes.andP;  It's easiest to enter these using the Alt-key method.andP;  Thecharacter numbers are: horizontal line, 205; vertical line, 186; upper-leftcorner, 201; upper-right corner, 187; lower-left corner, 200; lower-rightcorner, 188.andM;As you type, you'll notice that space characters in your macro arerepresented by a midline dot character.andP;  Press the Enter key at the end oflines, as usual.andP;  What is shown as [Enter] is a command key, so you'd pressthe three-key combination Ctrl-V-Enter to insert it.andP;  Don't try to type inthe special commands using the [ and] keys!andM;Creating this macro will take some effort, but you'll learn quite a bit aboutthe advanced macro features of WordPerfect 5.0 in the process.andP;  When you'vestudied this one, add pop-up windows to your own macros.andP;  Anywhere you'reprompting the user for information, you can expand the prompt into a helpfulwindow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
