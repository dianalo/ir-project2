The result is an uneven hemline that'sinteresting and looks to be less revealing than the traditional wrap skirt.;   Much of the Blass collection is clearly meant for special-occasion andevening wear. Particularly sexy, and sure to be copied widely, are the formalvelvet smoking jackets casually tied with sashes, bathrobe-style.;    Oneaccessory worth noting from Blass is the watch cap -- it showed up on many ofthe day dresses and suits and even for evening with the addition of arhinestone pin.;    Arnold Scaasi;  Starting off with Scottish-style tartandresses and a stirring bagpipe march, Scaasi's obviously hearing a differentdrummer than the rest of the designers showing collections thus far. Whileothers are sticking with shorter hemlines, Scaasi has dropped his to and belowthe knee.;    Scaasi's favorite silhouette in this predominantly eveningcollection is a shoulder-baring, waist skimming, full skirt. Frankly, it'shard to imagine Barbara Bush exposing her shoulders in one of these dresses,but on many women it could be a flattering look. And since Scaasi is herfavorite designer, he no doubt will come up with something special for her aswell.;    Fabrics are worth noting for both their luxury factor and color.Scaasi is liberal with velvet, chiffon and lavish with lace, appliques andembroidery. His prints include lots of roses, hearts and dots. Colors areoften eye-popping fuchsia, lime, purple, turquoise, orange and, of course,that shade that is becoming known as &quot;Barbara Blue.&quot;;    Carolina Herrera;   For her 10th-anniversary collection, Herrera sticks with designs that havebrought her success -- smart luncheon outfits, sexy cocktail dresses andattractive gowns.;    The day dresses, suits and trouser ensembles are mainlyin wool, classic in cut and pretty in unusual shades of pink with agreenish-brown, gray and cocoa, camel and chocolate and teal and pink. Muchbrighter is Herrera's use of her favorite combination of taxi cab yellow andblack -- in houndstooth-check dresses with black velvet cuffs and, fordressier affairs, houndstooth jackets shot through with metallic threads andteamed with slinky floor-length, black sequin skirts.;    Like Scaasi andBlass, Herrera is having a fling with lace, but makes it look fresh bylayering gold lace over navy-and-white lace over black. A feminine look isfound in her ball gowns with velvet bodices and layered organza skirts.;   Charlotte Neuville;  The former San Franciscan who has made her fashion markin New York takes her fall design cues from the streets and the '60s.;   Ribbed turtlenecks -- reminiscent of '60s &quot;poor boy&quot; tops -- are a keyelement, along with leggings paired with short, flippy dresses.;   Throughout, Neuville accessorizes clothes with what she calls &quot;HomeboyPendants&quot; -- large, sequined hearts, stars, crowns and peace symbols worn onlarge, long chains. They look to be a good deal lighter than the automobilehood ornament necklaces that they resemble.;    The evening look to rememberfrom Neuville is a very simple, short-sleeved, black T-shirt dress made from atextured, sparkling fabric she calls &quot;Astroturf.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY GOTTSCHALK, Mercury News Style Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910410  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  654  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 10, 199100101023,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
