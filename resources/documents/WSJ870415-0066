Following news of a wider-than-expected merchandise trade deficit, the dollar sank to another post-World War II low against the Japanese yen. It was quoted at 140.80 yen in late New York trading. Meanwhile, interest rates continued to rise as speculation grew about another prime rate increase. Commodity prices also reacted strongly to the dollar's slump    &quot;Everyone is concerned about the dollar. You have to be,&quot;said Tim Smalls, a vice president for equity trading atShearson Lehman Brothers Inc. In the past two weeks, thedollar has fallen more than 5% against the yen, despitefrequent central bank intervention aimed at propping up thecurrency. The dollar also continued its decline against mostEuropean currencies, though most of the declines weren't assevere.   Currency traders blamed the dollar's latest weakness in part on the Commerce Department's report early yesterday that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened to $15.06 billion in February. The trade gap has remained stubbornly high in recent months, despite a steadily falling dollar that makes imported goods more expensive. Continued trade deficits raise concern that the dollar may fall further, possibly hurting foreign investors' confidence in the U.S.    Market sources say Japanese buying of U.S. stocks and bonds has slowed lately, perhaps because of worries about the dollar. Japanese investors were expected to pump as much as $50 billion into the U.S. stock market this year, and their buying appetite has become an important psychological prop for U.S. securities markets.    &quot;Now the Japanese have switched back to buying in their own market,&quot; Mr. Smalls said. He also said that another seasonal source of securities market buying -- retail investors putting money into their Individual Retirement Accounts -- is effectively over this week.    Volume yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange soared to 266.5 million shares, the second biggest total ever.    The dollar could decline even further against the yen, some money managers believe. Nicholas Bratt, a managing director at Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark, said the yen could reach 130 to the dollar within a year. In early 1985, the dollar fetched 262 yen at its peak strength.    A more sudden but equally decisive market trend is the run-up in interest rates lately. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, which were about 7 1/2% in late March, climbed to about 8 3/8% by the end of trading yesterday. In the process, some bond prices, which move inversely to yields, have fallen more than 5%.    Losses have been especially pronounced in mutual funds that invest in long-maturity bonds. These have attracted billions of dollars from investors seeking higher yields than money market funds provide. &quot;In the last two weeks, a lot of these investors have given back practically all the gains they won last year,&quot; said Roger Hertog, a money manager at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.    (See: &quot;Wider Deficit Came Despite Imbalances With Japan, Canada, Western Europe&quot; -- WSJ April 15, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
