Accordingto the new data, emissions of sulfur dioxide from coal-fired electricgenerating stations decreased 74,000 tons, from 7.509 million tons duringthe first half of 1986, to 7.435 million tons in the first six monthsof 1987, at the same time coal use by those utilities nationwide increased11 million tons. The decline in emissions is attributable to furtherreductions in the average SO{sub 2} emissions rate which dropped from2.15 lbs. of SO{sub 2} per million Btu (SO{sub 2}/MMBtu) in the firsthalf of 1986 to 2.07 lbs. SO{sub 2}/MMBtu during the first half of 1987.These latest statistics are part of an ongoing NCA study of utility SO{sub2} emissions and support earlier conclusions that the emissions and theemissions rate expressed in lbs. SO{sub 2}/MMBtu are declining nationwidein the face of increasing coal consumption by utilities.</TEXT></DOC>
