In the 6,000-square-foot area, Liz Claiborne Inc. has posted 12 clerks -- five at the cashier's counter and seven on the floor -- double or more the number typically found in similar department-store sales areas.    Such participation on the part of apparel makers is becoming increasingly common. Under various financial arrangements, the manufacturers are designing their own departments to better show their wares, helping to train store employees and even dispatching their own salespeople to the floor, just as cosmetics and fragrance makers have done for years.    The motive, the clothing companies say, is better efficiency and quality of service. They argue that, to the shopper's eye, department-store merchandise is often unimaginatively displayed, and that many salesclerks don't know enough about the goods they sell.    For years, retailers and manufacturers have communicated poorly, with a resulting loss in sales and profits, says Kurt Barnard, publisher of Retail Marketing Report, a trade newsletter. &quot;They have failed to understand each other's operating realities,&quot; he explains. Now, he adds, given the uncertain retail environment, &quot;buyer and seller must work hand in hand in the interest of attracting customers.&quot;    Part of the service problem has been the changing nature of the work force, says Alice Bird McCord, a senior vice president at the National Retail Merchants Association, a major trade group. As more part-timers are used, she notes, stores see less incentive to invest in training.    Some in the industry say the situation is also an outgrowth of the fact that retail executives have been preoccupied in recent years by expansion and by mergers and acquisitions in the industry. &quot;They've diverted their attention from the sales floor to the financial office,&quot; says Mr. Barnard. &quot;Meanwhile, the consumer has been taken for granted.&quot; Adds Alfred Fuoco, chairman of New York-based Evan Picone Inc.: &quot;As store chains have grown larger, they've taken money out of their budgets for sales help. That has hurt us.&quot;    To address the situation, Evan Picone plans to double its eight-person staff of &quot;rotators,&quot; or staffers who tour stores coaching salespeople and spiffing up displays. J.H. Collectibles, a women's sportswear maker based in Milwaukee, has begun sharing the cost of a salesperson with Bloomingdale's in New York. New York-based Tahari Ltd., a high-fashion women's apparel maker, has a similar arrangement with Bloomingdale's and Macy's in New York and with Macy's in San Francisco.    Liz Claiborne went so far as to hire its own architect to design the selling space at Jordan Marsh. It will open a similar shop in Marshall Field's in Chicago this spring. Besides providing in-store personnel, the company fields a staff of 15 consultants who travel the country teaching salespeople how best to sell Liz Claiborne clothes.    While none of the companies will detail the costs involved, they typically report sales increases of 20% to 40% in stores where they've launched such programs. They say that this additional volume has offset the added expense without the need to increase prices.    However, skeptics say that, as more manufacturers get into the costly business of designing and staffing their own sales space, it's likely that either quality will fall or prices will rise. &quot;It's not in the best interest of the American consumer,&quot; says Bernard Chaus, chairman of Bernard Chaus Inc., a New York apparel maker. &quot;I resent very much the thought of us participating in any way in the infrastructures of stores, investing dollars where retailers should be spending.&quot;    Mr. Chaus and others think retailers may begin to pressure vendors into subsidizing the stores, awarding choice spaces to those who spend the most. &quot;What you're seeing in this whole development is a form of discount to get better space,&quot; says Alan Millstein, publisher of the newsletter Fashion Network.    Some stores, too, dislike the trend. A spokesman for Strawbridge andamp; Clothier in Philadelphia says: &quot;If a wholesaler decides they want to spend their money to do our job, they are taking it out of the product, or they will jack up the price of their goods.&quot;    Nevertheless, most people in the industry say that apparel companies' presence on the sales floor will only increase, and that makers of other goods will join them. Ultimately, speculates Arthur Britten, a New York retail consultant, &quot;it will all lead to vendors leasing their space. Like a mall owner, the department store will be a landlord of various stores.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
