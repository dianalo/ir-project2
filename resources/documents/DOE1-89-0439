Since1985, natural gas has been available as well. This can be economicalfor large-sized plants if the fuel currently used is heating oil andif the plants have to be retrofitted with flue gas purification systems.At the cogeneration plant the third unit, too, would have had to be backfilledwith a desulfurization system. As an alternative, BEWAG decided on switchingto natural gas as a fuel. The paper describes the set-up of the systemof natural gas supply to this cogeneration plant.</TEXT></DOC>
