The first lady in turn thanked the conventioneers who paid hertribute, saying they had given her the most fulfilling years shehas known.   ``You've given us such a wonderful life, a life I never dreamedpossible,'' Mrs. Reagan told the convention.``It's the mostextraordinary feeling to represent a nation and its people. I cannever thank you enough.''   Mrs. Reagan, introduced by actor Tom Selleck, appeared beforethe convention Monday night in the same melon-colored dress shewore the night her husband won the 1980 Republican nomination. ``Ido hang on,'' she laughed in noting her recycled outfit.   In a video presentation of their White House years shown to theconvention, President Reagan said of his wife, ``I can't imaginelife without her.''   ``I've been proud of her for a long time, but never more so thanin these last eight years,'' he then told the convention beforemaking his prepared speech to the delegates.   For her part, Mrs. Reagan alluded to the accolades she hasreceived for her anti-drug work and gave credit to the partymembers. ``You really gave me the chance to be more than I thoughtI could be,'' she said.   A poignant display from the president came earlier in the daywhen he showed up as a surprise guest at a Republican partyluncheon tribute to the first lady.   ``The presidency wouldn't have been the joy it's been for mewithout her there beside me,'' Reagan told some 3,000 guests as hiswife of 36 years stood beside him.   ``That second-floor living quarters in the White House wouldhave seemed a big and lonely spot without her waiting for me everyday.''   Mrs. Reagan was visibly moved by her husband's simple but deeplypersonal tribute. The couple embraced as the room erupted inapplause.   The scene reinforced the public image of the Reagans as a closeand deeply committed couple. They met when both were actors inHollywood and married in 1952.   ``What do you say about someone who gives your life meaning ...someone who is always there to support and understand you, someonewho makes sacrifices so that your life will be easier and moresuccessful?'' Reagan said. ``What you say is that you love thatperson and treasure her.''   He also said Mrs. Reagan had looked after him ``throughrecuperations and crises. Every president should be so lucky.''   ``Nancy, in front of all your friends here today, let me say,`Thank you for all you do, thank you for your love and thank youfor just being you,''' Reagan said.   Also paying tribute to Mrs. Reagan at the luncheon emceed byReagan's daughter, Maureen Reagan, the Republican NationalCommittee co-chairman, were several party officials and singerBarbara Cook and comedian Rich Little.   In brief remarks, Mrs. Reagan praised Vice President GeorgeBush, who is to receive the party's presidential nominationWednesday night, and his wife, Barbara.   ``Today the curtain begins to close on the Reagan era of theRepublican party. We've had a wonderful run. But the time has comefor the Bushes to step into the leading roles and for the Reagansto step into the wings,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
