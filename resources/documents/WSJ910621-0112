In Nantucket, Mass., where 82% of the island's houses arevacation homes, prices fell 35% in 1989, declined 11% morelast year and are dropping again this year.</LP><TEXT>   In the overbuilt resort area of Hilton Head, S.C.,two-bedroom condominiums that sold for $90,000 five years agocan be had for $40,000 -- often not enough to cover theseller's mortgage.   On Lake Winnipesaukee, N.H., realtors describe desperateowners trying to sell for half what they paid four years ago.   &quot;It's the worst I've ever seen,&quot; says Jack Armstrong, aLake Winnipesaukee broker whose family has been in thebusiness since 1932.   Mark Singer, a New Yorker who's trying to sell hisConnecticut country home and almost 40 acres of land, says:&quot;It's not as if the market's depressed. It's that the markethas ceased to exist.&quot;   Brokers and owners trying to sell second homes in manyparts of the country, especially the Northeast, echo thosesentiments. They say sales are occurring only at the highestend of the market.   That's quite a comedown after a decade of freneticexpansion in the second-home market, during which the numberof households owning one jumped 38% to 5.5 million. Vacationhomes became such an important symbol of conspicuous leisurethat the percentage of people who counted them as part of the&quot;good life&quot; jumped to 42% in 1988 from 25% in 1981, accordingto Roper Organization polls.   Fortunately, help is on the way, or so contend many in thereal-estate industry. The baby-boom generation -- 82 millionstrong -- is just hitting the prime age for buying secondhomes, 45 to 54 years old. Although recovery of thesecond-home market typically lags behind the primary market,real-estate brokers say demand will jump in the next fewyears.   &quot;Prices in this market won't rise, they'll explode,&quot; saysJohn W. Hawks, director of strategic research for DRC Group,a real-estate research and consulting firm. &quot;In the nextdecade, millions of baby boomers will buy weekend homes.&quot;   Others aren't so sure. Baby boomers have done many thingslater than their parents, including marrying, buying a firsthome and starting a family.   &quot;The share of baby boomers who will end up buying secondhomes in the next decade will be tiny because even those whoare affluent on paper will feel strapped,&quot; says CherylRussell, a demographer and author of a book called &quot;100Predictions About the Baby Boom.&quot; She adds that &quot;mortgagepayments, tuition costs from day care to college and savingfor retirement will prevent most baby boomers from feelingwell-off.&quot;   Even some realtors who believe the market will steadilyappreciate when this recession ends don't look for a repeatof the 1980s.   &quot;Back in 1986, you'd show a house, and there would beanother broker right behind you showing it. So your guy wouldsay, `What's he doing?' and you'd say, `He'll probably buyit,' so your guy would just buy it,&quot; says H. Flint Ranney,owner of Denby Real Estate in Nantucket. &quot;You don't see thatanymore.&quot; Mr. Ranney says that, with baby boomers now havingbabies, it will be 10 to 15 years before they can affordsecond houses.   Ms. Russell, the demographer, and others note that if evena tiny fraction of the baby boom buys second homes, that'shundreds of thousands of new buyers. But they say the babyboom's habits are unpredictable.   &quot;Travel patterns have changed markedly since the 1950s,and right now they're changing in a very profound way,&quot; saysClinton Burr, director of the Resort Property OwnersAssociation. &quot;Those same Yuppies who were weekending inAntigua six years ago are now loading their kids into astation wagon and heading off for a driving vacation.&quot;   During the 1980s, thousands of affluent young apartmentrenters, especially in the Northeast, bought second homesbefore they bought their first homes, seeking respite fromthe urban jungle and a chance to capitalize on thereal-estate boom. The city apartment served as sleepingquarters close to work, and the country home became a placeto turn off the television, talk to the kids and do the kindof handiwork they wouldn't dream of doing in the city.   &quot;It's become less a vacation home than the place wherefamily life is supposed to occur,&quot; says Gwendolyn Wright, aprofessor of architecture at Columbia University in New York.&quot;But increasingly, people can't afford to do that. It's agreat luxury to be able to split your life like this.&quot;   Indeed, many people have found that second homes are atleast as demanding as first homes. Alfred Gingold, author of&quot;The House Trap,&quot; a book about home buying, has been tryingto sell his vacation home in Columbia County, N.Y., for morethan a year and doubts if more than a dozen people have seenit. &quot;It's beautiful now,&quot; says Mr. Gingold, describingextensive renovations done to the old farmhouse. &quot;It lookslike a dream. I wish it were a dream.&quot;   What Mr. Gingold once sought in a country house he hassince found in a patch of green in a residential neighborhoodoutside Manhattan. &quot;If you're a New Yorker living in a studioapartment, you see a house with a lot of land and you thinkrapture of the deep. You think you're going to become one ofthe Cartwrights. I really had no idea of what was involved inowning property, much less in property you live 110 milesfrom,&quot; he says, citing termites, boilers and a neighbor whowore a gun when he came to call.   Thomas Miller, a Pitman, N.J., psychologist, bought asecond home in Kitty Hawk, N.C., four years ago. His plan wasto use it several weeks a summer and rent it out for therest. But Mr. Miller found he had to rent the house duringthe choicest weeks of the summer just to cover his mortgage,and even then he estimated he was losing $100 a month on it.Early this month, he put it on the market.   &quot;It got to the point where we were just going down to openthe house in the spring and close it in the fall,&quot; he says.&quot;And it wasn't looking that good as an investment.&quot;   Outside the Northeast, the picture is somewhat brighterbut hardly robust. In Big Bear Lake, a resort area 80 milesfrom Los Angeles, sales took a nosedive in the second half of1990; they have come back somewhat this year. In Carmel, nearSan Francisco, prices were flat in 1990 after a decade ofbooming. Santa Fe and Taos, N.M., hotspots in the 1980s, areailing, and Tucson, Ariz., is limping along.   In Whitefish, Mont., the economy is healthy, and peoplefrom Chicago, California and Canada are building homes. ButRichard Reilly, for one, has been unable to sell his vacationhome, which has been on the market since last summer.Although Vail, Colo., is generally doing well, JaredFichtelberg doubts he could get what he paid for histime-share a few years ago.   The declining second-home market has been especially toughfor condominiums. That market was so small in 1967 that theCensus Bureau didn't try to monitor it. But, following atwo-decade explosion, there are now more than 1.4 millionvacation condos in the U.S. The problem is that the federaltax laws changed in 1986, limiting the writeoffs people couldtake from losses on rental properties. That hit condominiumsespecially hard because so many were bought as investments,and the recession aggravated the problem.   So, too, has demography, as baby boomers with familiesseek more space and privacy. At Wintergreen, an 11,000-acreluxury mountain resort in Virginia's Blue Ridge mountains,condominium building has nearly halted. Property sales areoff by a third from their 1988 peak. At the Copper Mountainski resort in Colorado, condominiums in multifamily midrisebuildings just aren't selling. &quot;Buyers coming out of New YorkCity don't want to move from one apartment to another,&quot; saysHarry Mosgrove, president of the development company atCopper Mountain, which is planning to concentrate futurebuilding on more expensive, low-density housing.   Sheila Davis, a Long Island woman trying to sell her600-square-foot unit in Hampton Bays, N.Y., says she's&quot;giving away&quot; her condominium. Mrs. Davis put the condo onthe market in March for $110,000, dropped the price to$99,000 and now includes the line &quot;best offer accepted&quot; inher advertising. &quot;The market stinks,&quot; she says. &quot;A few peopleare looking, but nobody's buying.&quot;   People in the real-estate industry say the environmentalmovement has also changed what some people seek in a secondhome. &quot;It's back to nature,&quot; says Mr. Burr, director of theproperty owners association. &quot;Twenty years ago, people wouldbe happy with a bunker in Fort Lauderdale.&quot; Today, he says,many want places that have resisted large-scale development,such as the Hawaiian island of Kauai, or that are off thebeaten path, such as Bend, Ore.   Many people who would like to sell their second homes havedecided to try renting them out this summer instead. Realtorsin resort areas say the rental market is strong. But they saysome renters who once would have stayed three or four weekshave cut their vacations to a week or two. In some areas,such as Fire Island off Long Island, N.Y., brokers say rentalprices are down 15% to 30% from a year ago.   In any case, as many owners have found, renting oftendoesn't solve the problem. Jose Peczon, a Greenfield, Mass.,optometrist, bought a three-bedroom condominium in Vermont'sKillington ski area for $140,000 about five years ago. Lastfall, he sold it at a loss of about $40,000. &quot;Initially wewere using it quite a bit,&quot; he says. &quot;But after the firstyear the kids got tired of using it, so we kept it on therental market.&quot; Although the rental income covered the steepcondominium fees, which included heat, they weren't enough topay the mortgage.   Some real-estate industry observers say the younger babyboomers may go ahead and buy a second home despite theproblems, even if no one else does. Mr. Hawks, theconsultant, says this group is finding it can't make muchmoney on many first homes because the oldest third of thebaby boom &quot;sucked all the appreciation out of first homes.&quot;So he says the younger folks will &quot;keep a rental in the cityand buy a weekend house, where they'll spend Friday, Saturdayand Sunday nights. That's the European model of real-estateconsumption.&quot;   Those who do buy second homes are enjoying a luxury peoplehaven't felt in a decade: The real-estate agents pamper them,they feel no pressure to hurry, and they can often see pricesfalling before their very eyes.   &quot;They'll give you those little sheets, and the price willsay $250,000, slash, $200,000, slash, $175,000, and thatprice is four months old,&quot; says Gail Collins, who rents a NewYork apartment and is shopping for a country home. &quot;Thebrokers always say things are picking up, but then they showyou a $300,000 home marked down to $5.37.&quot;   Ms. Collins says she nonetheless feels as though she'sgambling. &quot;I don't know anyone who owns a house who's lookingfor a country house,&quot; she says. &quot;Even if you've both gotjobs, it's like, `What about tomorrow?' You feel like you'vegot to buy the country house cheap because you'll never beable to sell it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
