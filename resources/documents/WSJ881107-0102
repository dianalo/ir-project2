The latest phase of the two-year-old criminal investigation isn't considered a top priority by independent prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, and it is too early to tell whether any charges will be filed, according to people familiar with the matter.    From the beginning of Mr. Walsh's inquiry, there were plans to use a separate team of prosecutors to examine possible perjury by participants in the Iran-Contra affair, including relatively minor figures who haven't been charged with any wrongdoing. Questions of perjury typically are examined in the later stages of complex white-collar crime investigations.    The central focus of Mr. Walsh's investigation remains the role of current and former officials in the secret sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan Contras, according to law enforcement officials. Even though former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and his aide, Oliver North, have been charged along with others in the case, another federal grand jury continues to receive evidence on those issues.    Mr. Walsh is using a separate team of prosecutors for the perjury aspect of the case. He and his key assistants have eschewed exposure to the congressional testimony of Messrs. Poindexter, North and others who delivered testimony under limited grants of immunity. The immunized testimony can't be used against them in their trials on the substantive issues in the case, although they could be charged with perjury if it is shown they lied. </TEXT></DOC>
