The various ways in which small defects are introducedinto metals by processing, fabrication, environmental attack and servicestressing are briefly reviewed. Various practical situations are consideredwhich relate to either the low stress/high cycle or high stress/low cyclefatigue regimes to illustrate where Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanicsor existing Post Yield Fracture Mechanics can be adequate in assessingthe growth of short cracks. In the high cycle fatigue regime, particularemphasis is placed on the role of corrosion pits, inclusions and frettingand the associated short crack methodology used in assessing the integrityof rotating plant. Thermal loading is particularly important in hightemperature power plant and the use of damage tolerance concepts to describethe growth of short cracks in this regime is briefly described. Finally,difficulties associated with the treatment of short cracks will be identifiedincluding: (a) the undue conservatism often introduced by treating adefect as a crack, a process which can take up a large proportion offatigue life, particularly at low stresses, (b) the limited availabilityof reliable short crack data particularly for lower strength materials,(c) the effects of multiaxial loading and complex loading spectra onfatigue threshold have received relatively limited attention, (d) theincorporation of the effect of residual stress on the development ofa short crack.</TEXT></DOC>
