The panel voted 15-14 to defeat a motion to delete theprovision, which had been added earlier this week by a subcommitteeto the fiscal 1989 spending bill for the departments of health andhuman services, labor and education.   The Office of Management and Budget, in a letter to committeemembers, said presidential advisers would recommend a veto of the$139 billion bill if it includes the abortion provision.   The sponsor of the motion, Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., arguedbefore the committee that ``denying Medicaid funds to poor womenfor what is legal in this country makes no sense.''   The annual spending bill usually contains a provision sayingabortions can only be paid for under the federal-state Medicaidprogram when the woman's life would be endangered by carrying thefetus to term.   The version approved by the committee would return the law toits status before 1980. The same provision was added in 1986 incommittee, but removed on the Senate floor.   The 1989 spending bill is expected to reach the Senate floornext month.   OMB called the new abortion provision a Medicaid expansion that``diverges from longstanding policy on this issue.''   Weicker called the OMB letter ``a waste of power'' that divertsattention from the needs of the nation into ``narrow philosophicalissues.''</TEXT></DOC>
