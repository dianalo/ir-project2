The cable TV operators are expected to announce plans tomorrow for the new network, which is slated to make its debut this summer. The network, Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, or VISN, comes on the heels of myriad problems of evangelical broadcasters such as Jim and Tammy Bakker and their PTL Network and the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart.    The Rev. Daniel Paul Matthews, rector of New York's Trinity Episcopal Church and chairman of the National Interfaith Cable Coalition, which is developing VISN, said his group had been developing a plan for such a network before the recent scandals because of &quot;concern over the fact that the mainline churches were doing nothing to take advantage of the power of television.&quot; But he said the project came to fruition &quot;as cable operators became disillusioned with existing religious programming.&quot;    &quot;Four years ago, the cable companies would have yawned at an idea like this because they were riding high on income&quot; from various religious programs, Mr. Matthews said. But he added &quot;there has been a growing feeling among most respectable cable operators&quot; that the various evangelical programs didn't represent most Americans' religious needs.    Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable operator and one of the backers of VISN, dropped the PTL network from many of its systems last year and has searched for suitable religious programs &quot;representing a broad range of religions,&quot; according to Robert N. Thomson, vice president of government affairs.    The cable group, which includes United Cable Television Inc., Jones Intercable Inc., and Washington Post Co.'s Post-Newsweek systems, will invest about $5.2 million and agree to carry the network on their systems.    The network will launch with six million cable subscribers and reach 10 million by the end of 1988. It won't solicit any funds from viewers and will air programs from a broad range of Protestant, Jewish, Catholic, and other religious organizations, according to William Airy, a consultant to the group. Mr. Airy's company, GMN Management, operates the Gospel Music Network, a year-old cable network whose music program will be folded into VISN's own.    The Gospel Music Network currently reaches about 2.3 million cable subscribers. Mr. Airy said GMN will sell advertising for VISN and seek sponsors for various programs. Among the programs will be cultural and talk shows and programming aimed at teen-agers and young children, Mr. Airy said. </TEXT></DOC>
