The judge said the complaint failed to demonstrate how Mr.Milken caused the shareholders' losses or how Mr. Milkeneffectively controlled the California insurance company, asthe suit had alleged.                                                                                                          &quot;What this means is that you can't add Michael Milken'sname to every securities-fraud case in the country and expectit to stick,&quot; said Colleen McMahon, a partner at Paul, Weiss,Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, which represents Mr. Milken.   But other lawyers cautioned that law-suits linking Mr.Milken more directly to plaintiffs' losses won't necessarilysuffer the same fate. &quot;There are billions in liability outthere,&quot; said David Boies, a partner at Cravath, Swaine andamp;Moore, who is representing Columbia Savings andamp; LoanAssociation of California in its civil suit against Mr.Milken.   Nonetheless, Mr. Boies added, &quot;It doesn't mean open seasonon Milken either. You've got to have a good cause of actionand you've got to plead it well.&quot; Mr. Milken is currentlyserving a ten-year sentence for violations of federalsecurities laws.   In the First Capital suit, the shareholders alleged thatthe former junk-bond chief at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.controlled the insurance company in the 1980s and compelledit to purchase new issues of junk bonds as part of his &quot;daisychain&quot; scheme to manipulate the high-yield market. Theshareholders said that the scheme left First Capital with badinvestments that led to its bankruptcy-court filing earlierthis year.   But U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker ruled that anyallegedly deceptive statements on which shareholders relied-- such as the assertion that careful portfolio managementcould limit risks from junk bonds -- were made by FirstCapital, not by Mr. Milken.   And, the judge wrote, &quot;While these allegedly deceptivestatements may not have been possible without the existenceof an apparently vibrant junk bond market created by Milken,that background fact is . . . not sufficient to supportrecovery.&quot;   The judge wrote that the plaintiffs had failed to allegefacts that would support the notion that Mr. Milkencontrolled the company and should be held responsible for itsactions. Indeed, Judge Lasker added, the plaintiffs hadfailed to &quot;identify any meeting which {Mr. Milken} attendedor conversations which he had with any of the company'sofficers.&quot;   The judge also noted that the suit contained no factualassertion that the shareholders had directly relied on Mr.Milken's actions in their decision to invest in FirstCapital.   Since Mr. Milken's legal troubles began, a large number ofcivil lawsuits have been filed naming him as a defendant. Butso far, courts have been reluctant to allow plaintiffs tolink Mr. Milken to losses at financial firms in which theyinvested or entrusted their money. At least two earlier civilsuits, brought by investors in mutual funds, have also beendismissed.   Suits brought by individuals and institutions that dealtdirectly with Mr. Milken, rather than by shareholders, couldraise significantly different issues, however. For example,the Columbia case -- along with several others brought bydifferent financial institutions, including Drexel itself --involve plaintiffs that dealt directly with Mr. Milken. Thus,the plaintiffs will be able to cite incidents that they claimsupport their allegations that they were defrauded.   The plaintiffs' lawyers in the First Capital case saidthey expected to avoid a dismissal because of the closerelationship between Mr. Milken and Robert Weingarten, thefounder of First Capital. But Judge Lasker was nonethelessunconvinced by the allegation that Mr. Milken controlled thecompany.   Stuart Wechsler, a New York attorney who represented theshareholders, said he would probably appeal the dismissal. Headded that there are several civil suits brought by FirstCapital policyholders against Mr. Milken that are stillpending in state court in California.   ---   TWIN PEAKS GUIDE violated TV show's copyright andtrademark, judge rules.
