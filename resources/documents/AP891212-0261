Dr. Alan Solomon, who also heads a British company called S andS specializing in the examination of computer viruses, said severalthousand of the disks had been mailed to legitimate computer users.   Users' addresses had apparently been taken from computermagazines, said Solomon, chairman of the IBM Personal ComputerUsers Group.

He said he feared more couldarrive in the mail this week.   ``There is no urgent panic in the short term but if it hasalready been installed I would advise them (computer users) to seekurgent help because it is a nasty thing,'' he said.   A letter accompanying the disk asks for payment of $189 for onetype of license and $378 for another, he said.
