<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0475 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention relates to a fireplace opening cover, for an additionalor alternate method of eliminating flue loss of warm air when the fireplaceis not in use, and of controlled entry of combustion air when it is.Such a cover could be variously designed to be decorative. A shut-offdevice of this kind could be placed over the fireplace opening beforethe fire is completely out, thereby eliminating overnight heat loss withoutthe danger of combustion products entering the room. According to thisinvention the cover is composed of a sheet of sheet metal folded on theedges forming a hem with attached pivoting covers over inlet vents toallow controlled entry of combustion air. A small hole is located ineach top corner, allowing the cover to be secured to the fireplace byvarious means such as with clips or hooks on elastic, rope, wire or plasticlengths or with bolts, screws or nails. A variation of the inventionhas two metal arms attached to the inside surface of the cover extendingup against the throat of the fireplace holding it secure. The cover mayneed no securing against the fireplace opening other than being placedbehind an existing, free-standing fireplace screen or an object leaningagainst its front surface, eg. a fireplace accessories stand. The covermay be hinged vertically in the middle to collapse together for easierstorage when not in use, and to be used as a shield while the fireplaceis in use, where the shield stands freely in front of the fireplace openingby not being extended into its full 180/sup 0/ position. 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
