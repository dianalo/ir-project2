The Head of the Connecticut Regatta is an annual event on theConnecticut River that attracts some 2500 participants each year. The congestionon the river is such that each year, in the interest of safety of lifeon the navigable waters of the United States, the Coast Guard districtcommander has issued special local regulations governing the conduct ofthe regatta. By adopting permanent regulations, the Coast Guard will continueto provide the same level of public safety at reduced administrative cost.Public notice of the exact dates of the regatta will be published eachyear in the local Coast Guard Notice to Mariners and in a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before August 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be mailed to Commander (bb), First CoastGuard District, Captain John Foster Williams Building, 408 Atlantic Avenue,Boston, MA 02210-2209.

Personssubmitting comments should include their names and addresses, identifythis notice (CGD1 88-035) and the specific section of the proposal to whichtheir comments apply, and give reasons for each comment.The regulations may be changed in light of comments received. All commentsreceived before the expiration of the comment period will be consideredbefore final action is taken on this proposal. No public hearing is planned,but one may be held if written requests for a hearing are received andit is determined that the opportunity to make oral presentations will aidthe rulemaking process. The receipt of comments will be acknowledged ifa stamped self-addressed postcard or envelope is enclosed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The drafters of these regulations are LT L. BROWN, project officer, FirstCoast Guard District Boating Affairs Branch and CDR M. A. LEONE, projectattorney, First Coast Guard District Legal Office.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Regulations</ITAG>The Head of the Connecticut regatta consists of approximately 550 racingshells and 2500 participants racing in heats throughout the day. Duringeach heat, the shells will race against the clock and start in staggeredintervals of 15 seconds. The purpose of the regulation is to close theportion of the Connecticut River off the towns of Cromwell, Portland, andMiddletown to all traffic except participants, official regatta vessels,and patrol craft. Vessels under 20 meters will be allowed to transit theregulated area between each heat (approximately 15 to 18 times during theeffective period of regulation); and vessels over 20 meters in length willbe allowed to transit the regulated area during the lunch break between12:30 p.m. and 1:45 p.m., or as directed by the Coast Guard patrol commander.The regulations are needed to provide for the safety of participants andspectators due to the traffic density and the swamping hazards inherentto the low freeboard racing shells. The regulated area and immediatelyadjacent waters will be patrolled by Coast Guard vessels and state andlocal law enforcement authorities. The Coast Guard Auxiliary may be patrollingto advise nearby traffic of the content of these regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment and Certification</ITAG>These proposed regulations are considered to be nonmajor under ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulation and nonsignificant under Department ofTransportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979). The economic impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimalthat a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The event will draw alarge number of spectators into the area that will easily compensate areamerchants for the slight inconvenience of having navigation restricted.Larger commercial traffic will be given the opportunity to transit thearea during the afternoon break (12:30 p.m. to 1:45 p.m.). There is minimalcommercial traffic at this point in the Connecticut River, and as in pastyears, advance coordination between the Coast Guard and the oil facilitiesupriver of the regulated area will minimize or eliminate any potentialinconvenience to the commercial users of the waterway. Since the impactof this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that,if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 100</ITAG>Marine safety, Navigation (water).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Regulations</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard proposes to amend Part100 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 100_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
