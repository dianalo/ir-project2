The first involves a combination of chemicaland microbial methods used to clean up a sudden release of formaldehydein a railroad yard. The second involves the use of in situ bioreclamationto clean up a more gradual leak of gasoline at a service station. Ineach instance, the in situ microbial approach avoided extensive excavationof soils, roadways, and/or railroads. Both instances also involved otherremediation tools in addition to microbial remediation, emphasizing theneed to examine complementary and synergistic remediation techniqueswherever possible.</TEXT></DOC>
