The dollar closed at 122.15 yen, up from Monday's close of 122.00yen. The currency opened higher following its advance overnight inNew York, then gradually slid back. Sources said the Bank of Japanbought dollars to stabilize the currency when it was about to fallbelow the 122-yen mark in the early afternoon. The central bank doesnot comment on its activities.   Dealers attributed the dollar's rise in New York to the increaseMonday in the U.S. prime interest rate from 10 percent to 10.5percent, and the agreement by the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries to reduce production.   OPEC members meeting in Vienna agreed to a daily production quotaof 18.5 million barrels and a target price of $18 a barrel.   The announcement triggered a $1-a-barrel increase in oil prices.But Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the agreement's effect onexchange rates was mostly psychological and it would not immediatelyaffect the world economy.   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa Bank said the dollar fell after itsinitial jump because speculators in Tokyo had expected an increasein the U.S. prime rate and its occurrence did not change marketsentiment for a weaker dollar.   ``Many market players still tend to think they should get rid ofthe dollar now,'' Kinugasa added.   An exchange dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking anonymously,said other traders were awaiting the release of U.S. gross nationalproduct figures for the July-September period, due later today, andU.S. unemployment figures for November, expected on Thursday.   Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average regained 334.98points, or 1.2 percent, to return to 29,318.30. On Monday, the indexdropped 380.27 points, its largest one-day decline since Sept. 1.   The index gained 79.53 points shortly after trading began Tuesdayand advanced further in the afternoon, boosted by the stabilizedcurrency market, dealers said.
