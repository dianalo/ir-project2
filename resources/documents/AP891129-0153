HIGGINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush on Wednesday talked bytelephone with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl about Kohl'splans for German reunification as Secretary of State James A. BakerIII outlined a four-point U.S. stand on the divided country.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaer told reporters that Bushand Kohl had discussed the chancellor's plan and that they also hadtalked about Bush's upcoming summit meeting with Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev.   The spokesman said he had no details of the conversation.   ``We note that Chancellor Kohl is responding to the deepestaspirations of his people,'' said Fitzwater. ``This is a goal thatwe and the Federal Republic of Germany have long held in terms ofGerman unity.''   Baker told reporters at a pre-summit news conference that theU.S. position on German reunification ``should essentially embracefour principles.''   They are:   _The people of East and West Germany should decide forthemselves whether they want unity and what form it should take.   _A reunified Germany should be a member of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization and the European Economic Community.   _Any steps toward reunification should be ``peaceful, gradualand part of a step-by-step process'' to preserve European stability.   _Any change of borders in Europe should be made according to the1975 Helsinki accords, which specify that frontiers can be changedonly peacefully.   ``We really shouldn't endorse or exclude any particular visionof unity,'' Baker said. ``Unity can mean a lot of things. It canmean a single federal state. It can mean a confederation. Or itcould mean something else.''   There have been suggestions that a reunited Germany might beneutral, with West Germany withdrawing from NATO and East Germanyfrom the Warsaw Pact.   But Baker said the United States opposes such a West Germanwithdrawal from the Western community.   ``There should be no trade of neutralism for unity and thereshould be no dilution of the Federal Republic of Germany's liberaldemocratic character,'' he said.   Baker noted that Kohl had not mentioned changing borders. Someright-wing political forces in West Germany have called forreclaiming traditional German areas that have been in the SovietUnion and in Poland since World War II.   ``I think we should reiterate our support for the principles ofthe Helsinki Final Act, recognizing the inviolability of frontiersin Europe and allowing for the possibility of change in thoseborders only through peaceful means,'' he said.   Baker was asked whether he thought a Europe-wide conferenceshould be held to consider the German question.   He said he thought the 35 nations _ involving Eastern andWestern Europe, the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada _that signed the Helsinki accords ``all have a very firm anddefinite interest in what happens with respect to the question ofunification.''   But he said the focus should be first on what is meant byunification because the word ``means different things to differentpeople.''</TEXT></DOC>
