The Association of Professional Flight Attendants said the contract was approved by 68% of the 5,256 members who returned valid ballots. The union has about 12,500 members.    Union president Patt A. Gibbs called the contract &quot;the beginning of the end of the two-tier pay scale in the airline industry.&quot; She predicted it &quot;will help labor's efforts to weaken similar systems in other industries.&quot;    American, a unit of AMR Corp., pioneered the two-tier wage scale, which pays flight attendants hired since 1983 significantly less than senior flight attendants. Under the new contract, about 20% of the flight attendants on the lower scale will jump to the higher scale during the life of the contract, the union said.    In addition, the contract, which runs through 1992, provides modest pay raises for all flight attendants, as well as improvements in retirement and work rules, the union said. </TEXT></DOC>
