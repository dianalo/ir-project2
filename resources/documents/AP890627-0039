The state-run news agency Prensa Latina said the 47-membertribunal recommended after two days of hearings that Division Gen.Arnalfo Ochoa be dishonorably discharged and lose all his militaryhonors.   The panel called Ochoa's acts a serious blow to Cuba'sinternational prestige and said they threatened national security.It said a ``serious lack of moral character and corruption,dishonest management, improper use and pilferage of economicresources'' had been proved.   In testimony broadcast by state-run television Monday, witnessestold of officers under Ochoa's 1987-88 command in Angola sellingtroops' supplies on the black market, smuggling diamonds and ivoryand receiving kickbacks.   They also said he had helped Colombian cocaine bosses use Cuba asa way station for smuggling operations to the United States.   The witnesses _ three colonels, two lieutenant colonels and twocaptains _ testified before the tribunal on Sunday, the day Ochoaadmitted guilt and ``accepted responsibility'' for his actions,according to Prensa Latina.   Defense Minister Gen. Raul Castro, brother of President FidelCastro, told the tribunal Sunday that Ochoa's punishment should``set an example.''   Some Foreign Ministry officials interpreted this to mean Ochoamight face a firing squad. But others speculated Ochoa might bespared because of his combat service, his long friendship with thedefense chief and his high rank.   In their testimony, the witnesses gave detailed accounts of blackmarket dealings involving diamonds, ivory, sugar, TV sets, taperecorders, coffee, wheat, dried fish and sides of beef.   Most said they had believed the sales and conversion of theproceeds into dollars were geared to shoring up the troubled Cubaneconomy. They also said they believed the money was meant to improvethe quality of life of the Cuban troops in Angola, who were helpingthe Marxist goverment fight guerrillas.   At least $200,000 of the proceeds from those sales ended up in aPanamanian bank account apparently managed by Ochoa, witnesses said.   They testified that part of the money went toward buyingrefrigerators, stereo equipment, juice extractors, a bed, andclothing for several officers, including Ochoa.   Capt. Jorge Martinez Valdez, Ochoa's assistant and one of thewitnesses, testified that he began money-laundering transactionswith Panamanians and Colombians as early as 1985 on behalf of Ochoa.   He described direct contacts with leaders of the Medellin cartel,the world's largest cocaine-smuggling operation, based in Colombia.   Martinez said that the Colombians were under the impression thattheir Cuban connection had official sanction.   ``The Colombians thought that we were official representatives ofCuba,'' Martinez testified. ``In the visit to Cuba, they were put upat an official protocol house and a Mercedes-Benz was placed attheir disposal.''   Martinez said the Colombians, during one of their three visits toCuba, proposed printing dollars in Cuba and even setting up acocaine laboratory on the Caribbean island. He said the Cubanofficers involved only accepted helping the Colombians push theirproduct toward the United States.   Martinez said he traveled to Colombia on a false passportprovided by the cartel and met with cartel head Pablo Escobar. Hesaid the drug lord talked about obtaining some ground-to-airmissiles ``for his own personal protection so he could defendhimself against helicopters.''   Cuba has mounted an intensive public relations campaign againstOchoa, describing his alleged corruption in extraordinary detail inGranma, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.   In a break from its usual reticence to report on internalaffairs, Prensa Latina has distributed extensive reports on the drugscandal.   Ochoa was decorated for his service as a field commander inAngola in 1987 and 1988 and is one of only five officers everawarded the Hero of the Republic of Cuba.</TEXT></DOC>
