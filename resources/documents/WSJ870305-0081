TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci plans to get the White House to devise ways to lessen U.S. dependence on imported oil, congressmen said.    Rep. Beau Boulter (R., Texas) said Mr. Carlucci told him and two other congressmen that he would seek a presidential directive ordering the White House National Security Council &quot;to develop proposals and a national energy policy to deal with the national security threat posed by the high levels of imported oil.&quot;    Rep. Mickey Edwards (R., Okla.), who also attended the meeting last Friday, said Mr. Carlucci &quot;indicated a willingness to raise the issue's visibility in the White House and (the) departments and try to develop an administration response (that would) increase U.S. energy independence.&quot;    Advocates of a more activist White House response to rising U.S. oil imports have complained for months that former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan was their toughest obstacle. Mr. Carlucci's remarks, which coincided with Mr. Regan's departure, are the strongest comments in years from the White House on U.S. oil dependency and could signal an important policy change.    Michael Canes, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, said of Mr. Carlucci, &quot;It's good to know that a guy in his position knows there is a problem, and that he thinks that something ought to be done to reduce it.&quot; He said there was a &quot;general feeling&quot; among oilmen that Mr. Regan &quot;felt oil was like any other commodity, so we should let the market work for oil.&quot;    Imports currently supply about 37% of U.S. oil needs, and the Energy Department expects that to climb to 50% by the late 1990s.    Deputy Energy Secretary William Martin is expected to release shortly an analysis of the security threat from the growing U.S. dependence on energy imports and the alternatives to reduce the problem, including an oil import fee. Such a fee has been opposed by the Reagan administration but supported by several lawmakers from oil states. </TEXT></DOC>
