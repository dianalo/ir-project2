Especiallyfor the internal inspection of the long distance pipe, main stream willbe a TV camera using a solid pick up element from the view-point of picturequality and cost. Technical problems in the development are the compactizationand division of the inspection unit, cost reduction, and the peripheryequipments which enables to examine without causing any trouble to thegas supply to the homes. This report describes on the procedure and resultof TV camera development and the future problems, and contains the followingitems. Principle of solid pick-up element. Target performance of TV camera.Basic study on illumination and the optical system. Method of camerainsertion and recovery. Construction of TV camera. Inspection of corrodedhole by the camera. Eventually a TV camera system which can inspect theguide pipes without stopping the gas supply was completed including theperiphery equipments.
