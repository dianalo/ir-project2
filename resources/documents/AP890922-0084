The main arteries into town are either full ofwater or full of trees.''   Coastal residents _ who braced through the night for possiblehurricane-force winds _ awoke to lessening rains. But people in theregion around Charlotte, 200 miles from the coast, were battered bywind and rain as the center of the storm passed over at 5 a.m.   About 175 National Guardsmen were sent to locations around thestate to assist local authorities.

High winds toppled a transmission tower at WSOC in Charlotte, andwindows on the 42-story First Union office building were blown out.   Winds clocked at 75 mph were reported at Charlotte DouglasInternational Airport. A gust to 90 mph prompted evacuation of theFAA control tower at 4:15 a.m.   Duke Power spokeswoman Anne Sheffield said ``extremely high windsand heavy rains'' knocked down power lines in the city. She saidthere was no way to know immediately what effects were in Duke'sservice area outside Charlotte.   About 200,000 of the utility's 235,000 customers in Charlottewere without power.   ``Our chief concern right now is safety,'' she said. ``Peopleneed to stay at home to begin with, and when the storm subsides westrongly advise them to stay away from any downed power lines. We'reasking for customer patience today.''   The state emergency management office said 5 to 10 inches of rainwere forecast for 100 miles on either side of the storm's track.   Windows were blown out of First union's 42-story downtown officebuilding in Charlotte, said David Keathley at the Mecklenburg Countyemergency operations center.   Charlotte police Capt. J.D.

A tornado watch was in effect for the southern foothills,northern foothills and sandhills regions of North Carolina, while ahigh wind warning and a flood watch were in effect for nearly theentire state.
