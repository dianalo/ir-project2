Jay Goldinger, and four other financial advisersand investors, were accused by the Securities and ExchangeCommission of insider trading related to Pacific Enterprises'1986 acquisition of Thrifty Corp.   Mr. Goldinger, an occasional guest on local television andradio financial-advice shows and author of a new book ongovernment securities, was a bond broker at BeverlyHills-based Cantor, Fitzgerald andamp; Co. when the alleged insidertrading occurred. He is currently a director and officer ofCapital Insight Brokerage here.</LP><TEXT>   The other defendants are Bert R. Cohen, another CapitalInsight Brokerage director and Mr. Goldinger's former boss incharge of Cantor Fitzgerald's fixed income division; AndrewE. Gerald, a Cantor Fitzgerald broker; Harvey M. Rosen, aBeverly Hills investor; and Ronald A. Weinstein, a Bellevue,Wash., investor and a former executive at Egghead Inc., anIssaquah, Wash., software retail chain.   In prepared statements, Mr. Goldinger and Mr. Cohen saidthey didn't violate any securities laws. Attorneysrepresenting Messrs. Rosen and Weinstein said their clientsalso didn't violate any securities laws. Mr. Gerald'sattorney declined to comment on the charges, saying hebelieves it is &quot;more appropriate to let the court hear thesematters.&quot;   The SEC complaint, filed Wednesday in federal court here,offers a fascinating tale of the alleged spread and illegaluse of confidential information about the purchase of theThrifty drugstore chain. On May 26, 1986, PacificEnterprises, then known as Pacific Lighting Corp., held asecret meeting to get major shareholders' approval of theproposed acquisition.   Early the next day, two of the shareholders allegedlysought investment and tax advice about the deal from theiraccountant and from their financial adviser, Mr. Goldinger.The holders admonished the accountant and Mr. Goldinger thatthe information was nonpublic and confidential, according tothe suit.   Mr. Goldinger then tipped his supervisor and businesspartner, Mr. Cohen, according to the complaint. Before publicannouncement of the Thrifty acquisition the next day, Mr.Cohen purchased securities for himself and for severalclients, the SEC charged. He also allegedly conveyed theinformation to Mr. Gerald and to Mr. Rosen, who alsopurchased Thrifty securities. The complaint also alleges thateither Mr. Cohen or Mr. Gerald, or both of them, passed thetip to Mr. Weinstein, the former Egghead executive.   Thrifty shares skyrocketed $5.50 to close at $37.50 inAmerican Stock Exchange trading the day before the company'sofficial announcement. Ultimately, Pacific Lighting acquiredThrifty for about $800 million in stock. The defendantsreaped illicit trading profits related to the deal totaling$518,000, the SEC said. The agency is seeking disgorgement ofthe allegedly illegal profits plus $4.6 million in penalties.   In his statement, Mr. Goldinger said, &quot;I have not profited-- have not made one dime -- from the trading by others ofThrifty stock.&quot; Mr. Cohen said, &quot;I have not violated anysecurities laws, period. I'm absolutely convinced I will becleared by the courts.&quot;   Mr. Weinstein's Seattle attorney, Larry Finegold, said onhis client's behalf that, &quot;I'm confident that the court willfind he didn't do anything improper.&quot; Attorney Thomas L.Taylor III said &quot;there is no evidence whatsoever&quot; to supportthe charges against Mr. Rosen. &quot;He never received nor tradedon inside information.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
