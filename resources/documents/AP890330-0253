Like Ford, GM indicated the new package was mandated partly bythe recent rise in other kinds of interest rates _ includingadjustable rate home mortgages _ that have slowed consumer spendingon big ticket items such as cars and trucks.   Chrysler Corp., which has a program featuring 4.9 percentfinancing on some auto loans, did not immediately indicate it wouldmatch the cut-rate deals.   In addition to 2.9 percent financing, which is good only ontwo-year loans, GM said it was offering cash rebates ranging from$300 to $1,500, depending on model. Ford's rebates range from $300to $4,000 per vehicle.   The incentive programs offered by each of the Big Three havesliding scales for low-interest financing, with rates decreasingfor shorter-term loans. rate. Ford and GM offer 9.9 percentfinancing on five-year loans while Chrysler's package calls for a10.9 percent rate on a 60-month loan.   GM's new incentives take effect Friday and expire June 5. Ford'snew program took effect Wednesday and is to end May 31. Chrysler'scurrent program runs indefinitely.   The move toward lower financing rates comes as the automakerswatch early 1989 sales fall below expectations. Through March 20,this year's vehicle sales by the eight companies making cars inNorth America were running 5.4 percent behind last year's pace.   Monthly sales figures for March are due out next week.   On Wednesday, Ford lowered its 1989 sales forecast to about 15million cars and light trucks, down from a 15.4 million vehicleestimate made less than two months ago.   At the same time, production by the nation's Big Threeautomakers have been keeping up with ambitious schedules andinventories of unsold vehicles have been hovering around the 80-daylevel.   One way to trim large inventories is to offer incentives,although manufacturers pay for such programs out of their ownprofits. The prospect that automakers will have to offer bigger andbigger incentives to buyers has some analysts raising the prospectthat earnings reports for the first half of this year could belower than initially expected.   Ford and GM also were attempting to use their new incentives toencourage buyers to take shorter term loans. Both automakers havedropped their rate on fourt-year loans to 6.9 percent from 8.9percent.   About half of the loans written by Big Three automakers havefive-year terms, which have contributed to an increasing rate ofloan defaults and repossessions.</TEXT></DOC>
