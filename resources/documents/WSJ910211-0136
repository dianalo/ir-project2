Earnings plunged steadily throughout the year as problemloans rose to 3.03% of assets, a post-World War II high, andbanks set aside reserves for possible writeoffs of thoseloans, according to a survey by SNL Securities, aCharlottesville, Va., bank research and publishing firm. SNLsurveyed banks accounting for two thirds of industry assets,and projected fourth-quarter and full-year financial resultsfor all commercial banks.</LP><TEXT>   The banks' reserve additions did not keep pace with thegrowth in problem loans, SNL said, and the percentage ofreserves to nonperforming assets dropped sharply from theyear earlier, erasing a decade of progress in building up thereserve cushion.   Despite the continuing problems with the economy andexpectations of more problem loans, analysts said theyexpected a modest earnings rebound this year following thepoor 1990 results. They said the rebound will be stronger ifbanking regulators stress profit and capital-building overtougher loan examinations.   The profit downturn, which began in 1989, turnedespecially vicious toward the end of 1990. Profit for allbanks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationplunged to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter from $6.3billion in the first quarter of 1990, according to estimatesby SNL.   &quot;It was the worst year for banking since the GreatDepression,&quot; said Thomas Hanley, a bank stock analyst atSalomon Brothers.   According to Salomon Brothers' index of 35 of the largestbanks, profit for the fourth quarter was only $700 million.For the full year, Mr. Hanley said, net operating profit ofthe 35 banking companies, minus reserves for less developedcountry loans and asset sales, fell 28% to $8.7 billion from$12.1 billion in 1989.   The sharp earnings deterioration for the full bankingindustry is seen in the decline of profits as a percentage ofassets: Exclusive of nonrecurring provisions for lessdeveloped country loans, profits of all U.S. commercial banksaveraged 0.54% of assets in 1990, down from 0.80% the yearearlier, according to SNL.   The jump in nonperforming loans -- to 3.03% of assets from2.24% a year earlier -- was due largely to a rise in problemcommercial real estate loans. Loan-loss reserves, however,dropped sharply to 58.5% of nonperforming loans from 82.1% in1989.   SNL's data also provides evidence of the credit squeeze,as commercial loan growth in the industry slowed in 1990 to1.9% from 6.88%. In the fourth quarter, those loan balancescontracted slightly, with much of the decline coming from NewEngland banks.   Profit for the industry would have been worse, says EdwardFurash, president of Furash andamp; Co., a Washington, D.C., bankconsulting firm, if not for expense control measures thatbegan in 1989. &quot;The banking industry has actually been in arecession for the last eight quarters,&quot; he said. Alsooffsetting the industry's problems, Mr. Furash said, was themove by banks to increase fees on many of the basic bankingservices, and strong consumer loan demand in the first halfof last year.   For 1991, even tougher cost controls will help to offsetcontinued additions to loan-loss provisions, said JamesMcDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, a bankresearch firm which expects a median growth of 11% in profitfor the top 150 banking companies.   &quot;The dynamic that has to be woven into the earningsoutlook is a change in the regulatory environment towardenhancing profitability,&quot; he added. &quot;What the changes we areseeing suggests is more emphasis on building up bank capitalthan adding to loan-loss reserves.&quot;   Mr. Hanley of Salomon Brothers expects a modest overallearnings gain of 2.5% for his 35-bank composite this year,helped in part by the lower interest rate environment. &quot;Afterthe fourth quarter of 1990, when it seemed there was a newshock every other day, this year should be one where banksstart to dig out,&quot; he said.   &quot;By the second or third quarter of this year we shouldbegin to see signs of stability in credit quality,&quot; Mr.Hanley added. He said banks would fare better also if aregulatory plan for so-called loan splitting goes through.Under such a plan, banks could return to their earnings aportion of the interest earned on loans that technically areconsidered nonperforming but actually are meeting some of theloan obligations. Loan-loss reserves would also be reducedfor such loans.   Mr. Furash is not as sanguine about bank profits thisyear. &quot;The biggest problem today is that banks can't findenough quality loans to maintain earnings.&quot; He adds, &quot;Iexpect a continued erosion of bank earnings this year. Theonly question, depending on the recession and extent ofproblem loans, is how bad&quot; the erosion will be.   Aside from a high level of bank failures this year andnext, Mr. Furash said, he expects that &quot;as soon as theearnings decline bottoms out, bankers will move moreaggressively to merge with each other.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
