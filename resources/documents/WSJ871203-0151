As secretary of state in 1981, I objected to the zero option chiefly because the deal would weaken the West by removing an essential component of our deterrent -- not because the Soviets would never negotiate it. After leaving the administration, I made this position public. For example, I wrote in &quot;Caveat&quot; (1984) that &quot;it would risk uncoupling the U.S. strategic forces from the defense of Europe&quot; and intensify doubts among our allies.    As for Soviet acceptance of it, in 1981, before we had deployed any of our own weapons, especially the Pershing IIs that the Soviets feared most, I pointed out that we would never succeed in getting something for nothing out of Moscow. My fear that the Soviets would take the zero option once we had deployed the missiles has now been realized. To me, this treaty is the ultimate triumph of public relations over strategic sense and that is why I continue to speak against it.    Alexander M. Haig Jr.   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
