Separately, Kodak's Sterling Drug unit said it isdeveloping six new drugs with Sanofi S.A., its new jointventure partner. Until now, Sterling hasn't discussed which,if any, new drugs it's working on. Louis P. Mattis,Sterling's chairman, said in an interview that Sterling andSanofi are developing a diagnostic imaging drug and compoundsdesigned to treat strokes, angina, prostrate cancer,osteoporosis and Paget's disease. The two companies haven'tyet filed new drug applications for any of the compounds, Mr.Mattis said.</LP><TEXT>   Leo J. Thomas, president of the company's core imaginggroup, said Kodak's latest restructuring is different fromfour previous ones in the 1980s because now individualbusiness units will have more autonomy to develop productsand customize them for sale in different global regions.   But the biggest changes will be in the money-losing officeequipment business, where the U.S. sales climate is &quot;just atouch short of a disaster,&quot; Chairman Kay Whitmore said in aninterview. With the new management team in place, the unitshould achieve 10% profit margins in 1995, he said.   But analysts were skeptical. Michael Ellmann of WertheimSchroder said he hopes those &quot;now carrying the torch will bemore innovative, action-biased and results oriented.&quot; But, hesaid, &quot;only time will tell.&quot;   He was somewhat encouraged by the unit's new marketingstrategy. In past years, it sold complete informationmanagement systems -- including software and printers --directly to customers. Now it will start selling components,instead of systems, to vendors instead of customers.&quot;Customers are changing the way they want to buy things,&quot; Mr.Thomas said.   And Kodak will combine its copier business with its imagestorage and retrieval business. That way both can takeadvantage of each other's customers, which they hadn't donein the past, Mr. Thomas said.   Also, the company has turned off the chief spout thatdrained its office equipment unit; research and developmenton software that has nothing to do with imaging. The companywill no longer invest in software which helps integratedifferent systems or processes data instead of images. &quot;Wewant to be an imaging company, not a computer company,&quot; Mr.Thomas said.   The restructuring also includes several senior managementchanges. Katherine M. Hudson, formerly vice president ofcorporate information systems, was promoted to director of anew information services unit within the imaging group, whereshe reports directly to imaging president Leo Thomas. She isnow at the same level as William Fowble, who was named Mr.Thomas' No. 2 man. Additionally, Richard T. Bourns, a seniorvice president, was named director of the imagingmanufacturing and supply group, which oversees the making offilm and electronic imaging.</TEXT></DOC>
