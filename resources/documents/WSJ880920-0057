So great is the threat that the lawyers have crafted an uncharacteristic strategy: They are keeping quiet.    Lawyers who usually spend thousands of dollars each week on advertising for personal-injury cases are canceling TV ads until after the Nov. 8 election. So is the Florida Bar, which had planned a $600,000 advertising campaign.    The proposed constitutional amendment would place a $100,000 cap on damages that don't directly compensate for economic loss. Such a cap would eliminate a rich source of income for lawyers who take cases on a contingency-fee basis and thus keep a percentage of the damage award.    &quot;We don't want attorney ads to obfuscate or confuse the real issue -- the $100,000 cap,&quot; says Hollywood, Fla., attorney David Singer, who predicts a lawyer-bashing campaign by proponents of the amendment.    Although the lawyers will stay off the airwaves, groups that oppose the measure -- on the ground that it protects bad doctors, polluters and makers of unsafe products -- will be advertising heavily. With supporters also campaigning aggressively, the two sides are expected to spend $10 million to $12 million on their media blitz.    Successful Arbitration   Gets a Gold Medal   THE U.S. OLYMPIC boxing coach almost got kayoed by a legal dispute that would have kept him from accompanying his team to Seoul. But instead of going to court, the combatants took their case to the American Arbitration Association.    Advocates of arbitration and other &quot;alternative dispute resolution&quot; methods push these techniques for their ability to deliver speedy justice. In this case, score one for them.    In the weeks leading up to the Summer Olympics, boxing coach Ken Adams was locked in a legal battle with the U.S.A. Amateur Boxing Federation. It seems that Mr. Adams had been suspended from the boxing association for six months for grabbing the throat of the federation's controller during an altercation in the federation's headquarters.    He appealed the suspension, which would have kept him out of the Olympics. The Olympic committee recommended arbitration, and the parties agreed to abide by an arbitrator's decision. The advantage, says arbitration association President Robert Coulson is &quot;the speed. What they need is a very quick answer.&quot;    The arbitrator, based in AAA's Denver office, ruled that the suspension was too harsh a punishment. Moreover, he ruled within two weeks, clearing the way for the trip to Seoul and -- Mr. Adams hopes -- more conventional victories.    Prison Latest Site   For Smoking Debate   THE BATTLE over smokers' and non-smokers' rights has spilled over into an unlikely arena: a state prison in New Hampshire.    The question is whether inmates who don't smoke have a constitutional right not to share prison cells with smokers. And it could be resolved in a civil suit filed earlier this year by a state prison inmate, Clifford Avery.    Mr. Avery, who was recently paroled from prison, claimed in the suit that other inmates' smoking amounted to cruel and unusual punishment and violated his rights under the Eighth and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution.    U.S. District Judge Shane Devine of Concord, N.H., recently agreed to consider the federal constitutional issues. Judge Devine also allowed 19 other inmates in the state prison system to join Mr. Avery in suing state corrections officials.    Assistant Attorney General Dan Mullen, who is defending the state officials, says the state prison system has a written smoking policy providing for segregation of smokers and non-smokers in cafeterias and other common areas. Mr. Mullen says prison officials have added smoking to the list of factors considered when inmates are paired in cells.    Still, keeping all the non-smokers happy is complicated, Mr. Mullen says. The real problem? With little else to distract them, 70% of the inmates smoke.    Marshall Chides Judges   On Ineffective Lawyers   PEOPLE WHO are convicted of serious crimes frequently complain that their lawyers let them down. But judges hearing appeals based on claims of ineffective legal representation generally ignore these pleas and send the convicts back to prison.    Now one Supreme Court justice argues that judges aren't taking the issue of incompetent counsel seriously enough. Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall scolded the federal judiciary last week for giving &quot;short shrift&quot; to appeals from criminals who claim their lawyers were ineffective.    Justice Marshall reeled off a series of examples to support his argument. In one case, he said, a lawyer called his own client &quot;a leech on society&quot; and told the jury that &quot;he ought to be off the streets. He deserves to do hard time working in the fields.&quot;    Justice Marshall reminded judges that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees defendants the right to effective assistance of counsel.    Asked to comment on the justice's comments, prosecutor Ray Marky of the Florida attorney general's office calls the justice's comments &quot;an unwarranted insult to lawyers&quot; and an example of a &quot;severe bias against the death penalty.&quot; Prisoners given harsh sentences always complain about their attorneys, Mr. Marky says. </TEXT></DOC>
