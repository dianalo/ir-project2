<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0226 </DOCNO><TEXT>For the past several years, analytical chemists have been exploring thepotential uses of expert systems in analytical chemistry. In some casesthe results have been excellent but in others the results have been discouraging.Some of the discouragement may have come from an incomplete understandingof what expert systems are and why they cannot always be applied successfully.An expert system is a computer program that emulates the problem-solvingprocess of human experts. Because there are many such computer programs,there are many types of expert systems. The differences among these systemsare attributable to the different ways human knowledge is representedand manipulated in the programs. Along with natural language processingand robotics, the field of expert systems is generally considered tolie within the larger artificial intelligence (AI) domain. In this A/CINTERFACE, the authors will examine two different types of expert systemsand consider how they could be used in the analytical laboratory. Theywill also discuss some of the realities of developing and using expertsystems.</TEXT></DOC>
