Blaisdell, aPennsylvania oilman, watched in 1932 as a friend tried to light hiscigarette with a cumbersome two-piece Austrian lighter.   ``You're all dressed up,'' Blaisdell said. ``Why don't you get alighter that looks decent?''   ``Well, George,'' the friend replied, ``it works.''   So was born the trusty Zippo lighter, an American folk objectthat stands for American durability in Blaisdell's old-fashionedway. Blaisdell didn't just guarantee his lighters, he guaranteedthem for life, no questioned asked.   The Zippo Manufacturing Co., based in the northern Pennsylvaniatown of Bradford, is the last American cigarette lightermanufacturer. The company shipped its 200-millionth metal lighter acouple of months ago.   Company officials, who offered the Blaisdell anecdote, sayBlaisdell's promise set Zippos apart from the competition, foreignand domestic.   ``Zippos are some of the finest,'' said Eddie Dektor, aPittsburgh gift shop owner who has amassed 3,000 lighters, includingmore than 150 Zippos, during the past 30 years.   ``They work very well,'' he said. ``The mechanism and theworkmanship and everything is great. They also were the only companyever to give you a lifetime guarantee.''   Despite a decline in the number of smokers and the popularity ofdisposable lighters, business is better than ever for Zippo, saidspokesman William W. Jones.   The introduction of cheap, disposable lighters in the 1960sactually was good for Zippo, converting match users to use of bothdisposables and metal lighters, Jones said.   ``It made the country more lighter conscious,'' he said.   The privately owned company does not release detailed financialfigures. But Jones said sales in 1987 topped $37 million, and morethan 80 percent of Zippo purchasers buy them as gifts.   Zippo's slowest year was 1964, the same year the U.S. SurgeonGeneral placed health warnings on cigarette packs.   ``Even then we had a good year,'' Jones said. ``Sales just didn'tgrow as fast as they did in other years.''   Dektor said Zippos are history and a symbol of enduring qualityin the modern-day age of planned obsolescence.   According to Zippo, Blaisdell set up shop in a garage inBradford, a city that boasts it was once capital of the world's oilproduction in the late 19th century.   Jones said Blaisdell obtained U.S. distribution rights for theAustrian lighter used by his friend, but he could not sell them at aprofit until he improved their design, making them more attractiveand easier to use.   Blaisdell's fascination with another recent invention, thezipper, invented in nearby Meadville, led him to call his newlighter ``Zippo,'' Jones said.   The lighters achieved worldwide fame during World War II afterwar correspondent Ernie Pyle publicized them. The company saysBlaisdell became known as ``Mr. Zippo'' in Pyle newspaper columnsafter Blaisdell offered to distribute Zippo lighters to servicemenoverseas.   Zippo's entire wartime production was supplied to the military,where they were used to light smoking lamps and campfires in swampsand jungles, cook soup in helmets and light signal fires, notcounting lighting GIs' cigarettes from Berlin to Bataan.   The company said one pilot landed his disabled plane safely byusing a lighter to illuminate his darkened instrument panel. Thereare stories of servicemen saved when bullets were deflected offlighters carried in pockets.   Generals Douglas McArthur and Dwight Eisenhower wrote Blaisdelltestimonial letters saying his lighters never failed.   Blaisdell died in 1978 at age 83 in Miami Beach, Fla.   Today, the company is owned by Blaisdell's daughters, Sarah B.Dorn and Harriett B. Wick, and the lighters' conservative design haschanged little since the company's founding, Jones said.   About 200,000 dropped, crushed, mutilated or unhinged lightersare returned every year and are repaired and returned, or replaced,within 48 hours of their arrival, Jones said. Few people abuse thepolicy.   ``We find that there are so many honest people out there, it'samazing,'' he said.   Zippo once received a damaged lighter from a San Franciscosecurity guard who had been the target of a gunman. The guard hadbeen carrying the lighter in his front shirt pocket, Jones said.   ``He was confronted by someone who was trying to break in hisbuilding and was shot at point-blank range,'' he said.   The guard told the company he thought he had been shot in thechest, but found the bullet lodged in the lighter when he pulled itout of his pocket, Jones said.   Zippos remain a favorite of ``lighter maniacs''_ collectors whosometimes acquire several thousand lighters as a hobby.   ``I used to get them at flea markets, at house sales and atantique shops,'' Dektor said. ``After a while I developed anobsession about them. I used to get up about 5 a.m. on Sunday andhit four flea markets in one day.''   Earlier this year, Dektor stopped adding to his collection.Today, he's content to browse through them, recounting the storiesbehind some lighters, pointing out favorites, showing off unusualpieces.   About 1,200 of Dektor's lighters are displayed in two cases inhis small store. An eight-piece commemorative set featuring profilesof Elvis Presley, bought this summer during a tour of Zippo's plant,is displayed on one wall.   Collections of longtime lighter enthusiasts can range in valuefrom $5,000 to $20,000, with individual lighters usually costingabout $3, said Tom Prylinski of Erie, president of The Lighter Side,a 5-year-old lighter collectors' club. The Lighter Side has about110 members in the United States, Australia, England and France.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions Jan. 21-22.</NOTE></DOC>
