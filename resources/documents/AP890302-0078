Fifty-five corporations and public employers accounting for 16percent of metropolitan Miami's work force have joined in a campaignto administer urine tests to job applicants and to current workerssuspected of drug use.   ``This campaign will tell those entering the work force that ifyou use illegal drugs, don't bother applying for a job here,'' TedHoepner, chairman of SunBank-Miami, said Wednesday. ``At the sametime, it offers help to those who may have a problem.''   Business Against Drugs could be the biggest program of its kindin the country, Hoepner said. The companies involved represent137,000 employees.   The program, sponsored by the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce,calls for drug screening as a prerequisite for employment, testingof employees suspected of drug use and assistance to workers foundto have substance-abuse problems.   Workers who fail to respond to the assistance programs would faceprobable loss of their jobs, Hoepner said.   Among the employers involved are Burger King Corp. Knight-RidderInc., the University of Miami and Dade County Public Schools.   Charter members of the chamber can take part in an employeeassistance plan for $18.50 per worker annually and receive a reducedgroup rate for the urine tests.   ``The most effective means of controlling something bad is aforceful move, something that will create fear in the person,'' saidDade County Medical Examiner Dr. Joe Davis.</TEXT></DOC>
