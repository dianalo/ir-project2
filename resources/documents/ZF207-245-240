Can theytransfer you?andP;  No.andP;  They have to send you back to the operator.andP;  Arg!andM;In this situation you probably wouldn't mind if your call had been answeredafter one or two rings.andP;  If you heard a recorded greeting thanking you forcalling Very Big Company, telling you to dial 1 for sales, 2 for the servicedepartment, 3 for accounting, 4 for a company directory or hold the line foran operator.andM;You wouldn't mind because you would have wound up in the right place thefirst time.andP;  And if you did have to hold for the operator, he or she wouldnot have an attendant console that was lit up like Times Square on a Saturdaynight and would have more time to help you.andM;Think of poor Very Big Company.andP;  They are probably wondering why sales havedropped.andM;There is something to be said for personal service from a live human being.andO;Very Big Company could set up a separate trunk for frequent callers.andP;  When apotential client called they wouldn't wind up in the same queue withhusbands, wives, golfing buddies and frequent customers.andM;Those frequent callers would get their own, special, private phone numberwhere their calls would be routed by an automated attendant.andP;  They wouldappreciate the speed with which their calls are processed.andM;Other callers, using the phone number listed in the phone book will begreeted by a live attendant who will be much more rested and relaxed now thathe or she doesn't have to answer so many calls.andM;A third option is to use the automated attendant to handle the call overflow.andO;The automated attendant won't pick up until the phone has rung seven times(for example) without the attendant picking it up or until five people are inthe hold queue.andM;One and two port systems mean that automated attendants are not just for VeryBig Company.andP;  Small companies are often short-staffed.andP;  An automatedattendant can provide a small company with features and services theycouldn't give their callers if they were depending on the VP of operations toalso be the receptionist.andP;  An automated attendant gives every company, bigand small, a professional phone image.andM;Not The Same Old ThingandM;The first automated attendant was introduced in 1982, practically the dawn ofhistory.andP;  While the technology seems like old news to people in the industry,automated attendants are a pleasant new technology to plenty of users outthere.andP;  And even for the old-timers, there are new features to get excitedabout.andM;Many automated attendants are found in voice-processing packages.andP;  You getnot only the automated attendant, but voice mail too.andP;  And in some cases callsequencing, voice response and audiotext.andM;Almost all automated attendants these days let you get to a live operatorfrom any menu.andP;  Most let you dial for the operator or another extension ifyour call reaches a busy signal or if there is no answer at the extension youdialed.andP;  Those autom attendants that are integrate with voice mail also letyou leave a message at this point.andM;No more dead-ended calls.andM;Two features that seem very popular with manufacturers this year are callscreening and do-not-disturb.andP;  Don-not-disturb for an automated attendant isjust like do-not-disturb for a phone system.andP;  If the feature is activatedcalls will be routed to another extension or directly to voice mail withoutringing the called extension.andM;Call screening is the electronic equivalent of having a secretary screen yourcalls for you.andP;  Like real live call screening this can be good news or badnews.andP;  One piece of good news is that the systems that offer call screeninglet you assign the capability selectively.andP;  If you only want executives thatrate VP or higher to have call screening, so be it.andM;It works this way: when the caller enters an extension from the autoattendant menu the auto attendant asks the caller &quot;Who is calling please?&quot;andO;and records the answer; it dials the extension and plays you the person'srecorded name; and then it asks you whether you want to take the call or not.andM;If you choose to take the call (using your keypad) the caller is connected.andO;If you don't want to take the call, you and the caller have a number ofoptions -- depending on the particular automated attendant.andM;Some systems will automatically transfer the caller to voice mail.andP;  Some willgive the caller a choice among calling another extension, leaving avoice-mail message and dialing the operator.andP;  The caller usually gets somekind of message saying &quot;I'm sorry, that party is not available right now...&quot;andM;The whole effect is exactly like having a live secretary give you the brushoff.andP;  Anti-technology types will probably think that being screened by amachine is worse than being screened by a human.andP;  It's another feature tohandle with care.andM;Another interesting innovation is automated attendants that back-up directinward dial trunk and Centrex lines, With this feature the automatedattendant will not only greets callers at the main number, but will also pickup calls dialed directly that reach a busy signal or aren't answered.andM;What will the future bring for automated attendants?andP;  We'll bet on more voicerecognition.andP;  Rotary-dial phones are still a big drag for voice-processingsystems.andP;  All those rotary-dial people have to wait for the operator.andP;  Theircalls can't be automated.andM;With voice recognition, callers with rotary-dial phones can use automatedattendants and voice-processing systems.andP;  Plus, as Votan's new systemillustrates, with voice recognition, the growing number of cellular phoneusers can access call-processing systems without causing a traffic accident.andM;Telecommunication technology saving lives!andP;  That's what it's all about, isn'tit?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
