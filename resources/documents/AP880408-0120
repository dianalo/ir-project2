Paul Simon drove himself to alocal shopping mall and bought two sport shirts for a week-longvacation trip to Puerto Rico.   Not an unusual event for a man about to spend some leisure timewith his family.   But for Simon, the shopping excursion was the first time inthree months he appeared in public without a Secret Service escortwatching his every move and those by people around him.   The constant protection has a price in personal freedom, as wellas in dollars.   The Secret Service has protected five 1988 presidentialcandidates, not including Vice President George Bush, for the pastfew months at a cost of $15,000 a day for each man.   Until the number of candidates began to dwindle _ the federalagency only protects two now _ the cost to the taxpayers was$75,000 a day or $525,000 a week.   As expensive as that might sound, it pales at what was spent toguard Pope John Paul II during his 11-day visit to the UnitedStates last year _ $4.9 million or some $445,455 per day.   Secret Service Director John R. Simpson and Francis A. Keating,assistant Treasury Secretary for enforcement, in recent testimonyand documentation submitted to a Senate appropriationssubcommittee, called the Pope's visit to the United States ``thesingle most demanding protective event in our history.''   The Secret Service received a supplemental appropriation of $5.6million to cover the costs of the pontiff's visit, in addition toits regular budget of $367 million for the fiscal year that endsSept. 30.   Keating, who has since been nominated to be the JusticeDepartment's No. 3 man, and Simpson said the Secret Service hasprotected four Democrats and one Republican presidential candidatesover the past four or five months. Vice President Bush getscoverage by virtue of his office, and Democrats Albert Gore Jr. andJesse Jackson also receive the protection.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Kansas Sen. Bob Doledeclined protection. Kitty Dukakis, the governor's wife, saidDukakis believes that ``it would be just one additional layer fromthe people.'' Walt Riker, Dole's press secretary, said Dole has asimilar belief.   Candidate dropouts Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and GaryHart of Colorado also received Secret Service escorts. So didRepublican Pat Robertson, who has all but abandoned his race.   Keating said the Secret Service never guarded Bruce Babbitt,Alexander Haig and Pete du Pont because a five-member advisorycommittee did not recommend them to the Treasury secretary whomakes the final decision.   Candidate protection is determined by a panel consisting of aSupreme Court justice, the Senate majority leader and minorityleaders and the House speaker and minority leader, who meet to makerecommendations to the Treasury secretary. Among the things takeninto consideration: the number of delegates a candidate receivesand whether any death threats have been made against the candidate.   If the secretary accepts the panel's recommendations, thecandidate is notified. To decline protection, a candidate mustinform the secretary in writing.   The Secret Service received an appropriation of $29.9 millionfor fiscal 1988 to provide the protection during the campaign. Theagency is seeking another $7.1 million to cover the campaign periodfrom Oct. 1 until the Nov. 8 election, and then for coverage of thepresident-elect, the vice president-elect and their families andspouses through the inauguration.</TEXT></DOC>
