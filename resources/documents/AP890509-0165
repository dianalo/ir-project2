The plaintiffs said they feared states with more illegal alienswould get a disproportionate number of House seats and electoralvotes, thus diminishing the political power of states with fewerillegal aliens.   The Census Bureau argued it is constitutionally obligated tocount everyone, including illegal aliens, for congressionalapportionment and has done so since the first census in 1790. Houseseats are redistributed every 10 years to reflect populationchanges.   U.S. District Judge William L. Standish said, in a ruling filedlate Monday, that the plaintiffs cannot show they would be hurt bythe 1990 census because ``they are unable to establish how manyillegal aliens will be present ..., in which states these illegalaliens will reside, or to what extent the illegal population willcome forward to be counted.''   The lawsuit was filed last year by the congressmen, led byPennsylvania Republican Tom Ridge, and the states of Pennsylvania,Kansas and Alabama.   Ridge said Tuesday that Standish dismissed the lawsuit ``ontechnical, legal grounds and not on the merits of the CensusBureau's plans.''   Ridge, recently named vice chairman of a House subcommittee thatoversees the Census Bureau, said he may appeal Standish's decisionand will introduce legislation in Congress to change the method ofthe 1990 count.   Standish's opinion noted that the congressmen's demographeroffered estimates that up to 5.6 million illegal aliens will becounted in 1990. The demographer predicted a gain of up to fourcongressional seats for California and one seat for Texas, and thepossible loss of one seat each for Georgia, Wisconsin, NorthCarolina, Minnesota and Michigan.   The judge noted another congressional analyst had predictedgains for California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida at theexpense of Pennsylvania, Kansas, West Virginia and Alabama.   But, the judge said, ``Based on the evidence offered, it issheer speculation as to the identities of the states that will beaffected by the inclusion of illegal aliens.''   Standish also said the state governments of Pennsylvania, Kansasand Alabama cannot show they would be damaged by ``reduced power orprestige'' with the loss of congressional representation. He saidonly the residents of the states might suffer and they did not filethe lawsuit.   Standish noted that the non-profit Federation of AmericanImmigration Reform, a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, filed a similarlegal action in 1980 that was dismissed by a three-judge federalpanel in the District of Columbia.   Ridge was joined by 19 colleagues from Pennsylvania, and othersfrom Kansas, West Virginia, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana,Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Wisconsin,Alabama, California and Maryland.</TEXT></DOC>
