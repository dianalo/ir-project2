Consequently, there is a need for a low cost retrofit acid rainprecursor control technology and Reburning - Sorbent Injection, is onesuch technology. The injection of calcium based sorbents for in-furnaceSO/sub 2/ control has been the subject of much research effort over thelast twenty years because of a desire to develop an alternative to fluegas desulfurization. Full scale demonstrations carried out by TVA inthe early 1970's gave rather poor results. Recent experience in Germanyand research funded by EPA suggest that significantly higher SO/sub 2/capture levels can be achieved by injecting the sorbent at the most appropriatelocation in the furnace which is dependent upon the temperature and flowfield in each application. Upper furnace injection involves the injectionof calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide at an appropriate temperature,approximately 2250{sup 0}F. The sorbent calcines and subsequently reactswith sulfur dioxide to produce a solid calcium sulfate which can be removedtogether with the fly ash in the particulate control device. Recent studieshave indicated that injection at lower temperatures may also allow sulfurcapture. R-SI will use the most appropriate sorbent injection locationdependent upon system constraints to achieve the maximum sulfur capture.In this paper the process studies were conducted in the 2.5 m refractory-linedcontrolled temperature tower (CTT). This 25 kW furnace is 20.3 cm indiameter and the time/temperature profile can be adjusted using backfiredheating sections within the refractory walls. The experiment resultsare presented in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
