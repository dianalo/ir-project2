Mr. Dukakis, who clinched his party's presidential nomination in final primaries this month, offered no specifics as to what system he would prefer. But his advisers said that among the options that could be considered is a variation of the Midgetman that would be deployed in fixed silos rather than more costly mobile launchers.    Such an idea has been advanced by Kosta Tsipis, a nuclear physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a weapons expert who is sometimes consulted by the campaign. Mr. Dukakis' advisers said any decision would be made in the context of arms control talks.    Mr. Dukakis sought in a speech here to focus attention on a proposal that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization seek substantial cuts in conventional weapons in Europe. But the governor had to field questions about his views on nuclear weapons, which are drawing increasing attention as a test of his military-policy and foreign-policy knowledge and of his ability to resolve differences within his party on arms control.    Vice President George Bush, citing Mr. Dukakis' opposition to such weapons systems as the MX and the Midgetman, already has begun to portray the governor as weak in his commitment to defense. And even some Democrats insist the U.S. should develop one of the missiles.    In recent years, Congress generally has been divided between the MX and Midgetman schemes. Mr. Dukakis's rejection of both missiles puts him at odds with leading moderates in his party. He also opposes the administration's costly anti-missile defense program, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. But some observers believe that to prevail against the SDI program, he must first assure lawmakers that he will reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. land-based nuclear arsenal.    Both the MX and Midgetman alternatives are designed to reduce this vulnerability by having some mobility in case of an attack. In arms talks with Moscow, Washington is seeking a ban on mobile weapon systems already developed by the Soviet Union, but the Pentagon argues the U.S. must develop its own alternatives in the absence of such an agreement.    Mr. Tsipis would address the vulnerability question by deploying hundreds of small, single-warhead missiles like the Midgetman. The theory is that in an attack, the Soviets would be reluctant to exhaust their arsenal attempting to destroy each silo. &quot;We inexorably are moving toward single-warhead missiles,&quot; said Mr. Tsipis.    Critics argue that he may be overly optimistic, though. And Mr. Dukakis is certain to face more pressure on the question from Vice President Bush, who supports both the MX and Midgetman. Moreover, most of the members of Congress being considered as potential running mates for Gov. Dukakis have backed one or the other missile plans. The defense authorization bill pending in Congress is expected to put off any decision until a new administration takes office next year.    Mr. Dukakis is scheduled tomorrow to begin a campaign swing through the South. Yesterday, his close friend, Paul Brountas, met privately with members of Congress in preliminary talks aimed at screening the field for likely running mates. </TEXT></DOC>
