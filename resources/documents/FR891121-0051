Delivery units containing live hogs weighingunder 210 pounds but not less than 200 pounds and weighing over 240 poundsbut not more than 250 pounds are deliverable on the current contract ata discount of 50 cents per hundredweight. Hogs weighing less than 200 poundsor more than 250 pounds are not deliverable on the contract. The existing provisions of the futures contract also specify seven (7)delivery points. At present, the contract provides for par delivery onlyat Peoria, Illinois. Futures deliveries at Omaha, Nebraska; Sioux City,Iowa; and East St. Louis, Illinois are at a discount of 25 cents per hundredweight.Deliveries at Kansas City, Missouri; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and St.Joseph, Missouri are at a discount of 50 cents per hundredweight. Deliveryof live hogs at St. Paul, Minnesota is at discount of 75 cents per hundredweight.The proposed amendments would: (1) Increase the size of the contract'sdelivery unit from 30,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds; (2) increase the parweight range of deliverable hogs from 210 to 240 pounds to a new par weightrange of 230 to 260 pounds; (3) increase from 90 to 150 the number of hogsin a delivery unit which must fall into the par weight range; (4) imposea discount of $3.00 per hundredweight for delivery of hogs weighing under220 pounds but not less than 215 pounds; (5) specify a discount of $1.00per hundredweight for the delivery of hogs weighing under 230 pounds butnot less than 220 pounds and for heavier hogs weighing over 260 poundsbut not more than 270 pounds; (6) specify a discount of $2.00 per hundredweightfor the delivery of hogs weighing over 270 pounds but not more than 280pounds; (7) stipulate that hogs weighing under 215 pounds or over 280 poundsare not deliverable on the futures contract; and (8) allow par deliveryof hogs at Omaha, Nebraska; Sioux City, Iowa; and Sioux Falls, South Dakotaas well as at Peoria, Illinois, the existing par delivery point, with nochanges in the discounts for the remaining delivery points. The Exchange maintains that the proposed changes reflect current conditionsand practices in the cash hog market. In regard to the proposed increasein the contract's size from 30,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds, the Exchangenotes that the standard size truckload of hogs has become larger, makingit inconvenient and costly to deliver hogs in units of 30,000 pounds. TheCME indicates that transporting hogs in truckload sizes of 40,000 poundsis economically more efficient than in truckloads of 30,000 pounds andthat hogs can be safely shipped in 40,000-pound truckloads. The Exchange submits that increasing the par weigh range to 230-260 poundsfrom 210-240 pounds would reflect the average current commercial slaughterweight of hogs, as packers are slaughtering and producers are marketinghogs at heavier weights. In this respect, the CME notes that data on slaughterhog weights reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for sevenprimary hog markets show that the average weekly slaughter weight for theperiod 1984 to 1988 fluctuated between 230 and 260 pounds. The Exchangealso states that increasing to 150 from 90 the number of hogs in a deliveryunit which fall within the par weight range is necessary because of thelarger proposed contract size, and also because packers are demanding moreuniform hogs in addition to heavier hogs. According to the CME, the proposedincrease in the number of hogs that must fall within the par weight rangewill result in fewer hogs falling outside the range of weights which aredesirable to packers.The Exchange maintains that the proposed discounts for hogs that weighoutside the par weight range reflect prevailing cash market price differentials.In this regard, the CME indicates that USDA data on price differentialsbetween heavier hogs (230-250 pounds) and lighter hog (210-220 pounds)for 1988 show discounts for the lighter weight hogs which range from $0.00to $4.00 per hundredweight. The Exchange also indicates that packers havereported discounts ranging from 25 cents to $3.00 per hundredweight forhogs weighing in excess of the proposed par weight range.As noted above, the Exchange is proposing to expand the number of the pardelivery locations to include Sioux City, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; and SiouxFalls, South Dakota in addition to Peoria, Illinois, as currently specifiedin the futures contract. The CME indicates that these changes are consistentwith prevailing cash market pricing relationships among the contract'sdelivery points. In particular, the CME indicates that its evaluation ofdata on cash price differentials between the contract's delivery pointsindicate that cash prices for hogs at Sioux City, Omaha and Sioux Fallsare no longer at a discount to cash prices for hogs at Peoria. In addition,the Exchange notes that above 24 percent of the hog production and 28.2percent of the U.S. hog slaughter occurs in Iowa and that Sioux City, Omahaand Sioux Falls directly serve the Iowa area. The CME also notes that receiptsof salable hogs at Sioux City, Omaha and Sioux Falls are comparable toor greater than receipts of saleable hogs at Peoria.The CME intends to make the proposed amendments effective for all newlylisted contract months following Commission approval.The Commission is seeking comments on the proposed amendments noted above.In particular, the Commission is requesting comment on the extent to whichthe proposed changes reflect cash market conditions or practices.Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at theOffice of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 KStreet NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the amended terms and conditionscan be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the aboveaddress or by phone at (202) 254-6314.The materials submitted by the Exchange in support of the proposed amendmentsmay be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act(5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR part145 (1987)). Requests for copies of such materials should be made to theFOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance Staff of the office of the Secretariatat the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8.Any person interested in submitting written data, views or arguments onthe proposed amendments should send such comments to Jean A.
