Eastern employees rallied in Washington, New Jersey and New York,where Gov. Mario Cuomo threw his support behind the workers andchallenged President Bush to intervene in the labor war with Easternboss Frank Lorenzo.   Eastern's 8,500 Machinists entered their third week on strike,which has crippled the nation's seventh-largest airline and forcedit to seek bankruptcy protection. The workers have refused to givewage concessions.   And a top Teamsters official warned that the strike could beexpanded to struggling Pan Am, which competes with Eastern on theBoston-New York-Washington shuttle route.   ``One of the (strike) targets would be the shuttle of PanAmerican ... where Eastern Airlines is now being picketed,'' saidWilliam F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters Air Division.``Therefore we could tie up the Northeast corridor of the UnitedStates.   ``The strike at Eastern Airlines is a fight for every workingperson in the United States.''   Federal judges have restrained other unions from sympathy strikesthat could have extended to the nation's railways and otherairlines. But Genoese said a Pan Am strike would be legal becauseits 4,200 Teamsters employees have an open contract and other unionscould honor their picket lines as pilots and flight attendants havedone at Eastern.   Pan American has beefed up its shuttle service since Eastern'sstrike began March 4 while Eastern dropped fares to attractpassengers to its shuttle flights.   Genoese said he didn't want to discuss strike timing or strategyfurther.   Meanwhile, rallies in Washington, New York and Newark launchedthe third week of the walkout.   A crowd estimated by police at more than 1,000 turned out for arousing, flag-waving rally at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Gov.Mario Cuomo, wearing a black satin pilot's jacket and a pilot's cap,challenged President Bush to intervene in the labor war with Lorenzo.   ``Focus your thousand points of light on this situation. It'stime to lead, Mr. President,'' he said.   In Washington, about 300 people gathered across the street fromthe White House to hear similar remarks aimed at Bush, who wasreported to be relaxing on the White House grounds playinghorseshoes and tennis.   ``C'mon George, get with it,'' said Interntional Association ofMachinists President William Winpisinger, pointing at the WhiteHouse. He called for Bush to intervene by naming an emergency boardto mediate the dispute.   Bush declined to impose a cooling-off period that would havedelayed the strike by 60 days, and has remained opposed togovernment intervention in the walkout that began March 3.   Jesse Jackson, who has been walking picket lines with thestrikers in the past two weeks, said he was making ``an appeal topresidential leadership, an appeal for mercy and justice.''   In Newark, a crowd estimated at about 700 people attended a rallyin front of the Continental Airlines terminal that was cut short bytorrential rains.   Genoese made his comments after having breakfast Saturday withCharles E. Bryan, head of Eastern's Machinists union, and localTeamsters and Machinists officials to discuss strategy, including aproposed joint employee buyout that would combine the two strugglingairlines.   ``This is the opportunity of a lifetime,'' Genoese said. ``Theycan save two airlines.''   Bryan has been pushing several years for employee control ofEastern as a solution to its problems, and Genoese said Eastern'ssituation provides an opening to combine that goal with a similareffort he has pushed for years at Pan Am.   Bryan said the employees had ample financial backing, butdeclined to give details.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the company wouldn't commenton the Bryan-Genoese remarks. There was no answer Saturday at Pan Amcorporate headquarters.   Although Eastern and Pan Am are two of the weakest majorcarriers, Bryan and Genoese said their route structures andpersonnel combined could create a strong, stable airline.   Bryan added that other possibilities are still being explored,such as a buyout of Lorenzo by financier Carl Icahn, owner andchairman of Trans World Airlines Inc. Lorenzo has expressed renewedinterest in selling Eastern.   Pan Am, like Eastern, has been racked by financial losses andlabor tensions. Pan Am Chairman Tom Plaskett recently said thecarrier probably would need to merge with another airline to ensureits survival.   In a memo circulated Friday, Eastern said it could no longer waitfor its pilots to return to work.   ``New pilots are our only viable option,'' the message said. ``Insummary, total pilot capacity will determine whether Eastern livesor dies.''   However, the pilots union says few experienced pilots areavailable for Eastern to hire.   Eastern, with only 200 pilots crossing picket lines, has beenable to operate about 10 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1,040daily flights.   Bryan said the Eastern unions will fight in bankruptcy courtagainst all sales and transfers of Eastern assets, including theairline's notice late last week that it was putting narrow-bodyplanes in its 250-aircraft fleet up for sale.   He said transfers of assets such as Eastern landing slots in NewYork and Washington to Texas Air's predominantly non-unionContinental are part of ``an enormous psychological war'' againstEastern employees.</TEXT></DOC>
