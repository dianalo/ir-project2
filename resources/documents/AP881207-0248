DannyWall says he believes the worst is behind the troubled savings andloan industry.   ``There are fewer unprofitable institutions than there were lastyear,'' Wall told the National Council of Savings Institutions at anannual management conference Tuesday.   He said that ``by the end of the month we will have dealt withthe worst cases'' of insolvent thrifts, and that with $30 billionmore his regulatory agency could tackle the others.   But the council, which represents about 500 of the moreprofitable savings banks and Sandamp;Ls nationwide, painted a more somberpicture of the industry Tuesday. They said Wall might beunderestimating the cost of removing the 511 insolvent thriftsnationwide.   The group says that one solution is to phase out the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures desposits of up to$100,000 among the nation's thrifts and is currently in red ink, andto use taxpayer money toward the clean-up costs.   In a plan released last week and outlined again Tuesday, thecouncil said that healthy thrifts should be transferred to the morestable Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the insurer of banks andsome Sandamp;Ls. Those that failed to meet the FDIC's stiffer capitalrequirements would have five years to become healthy or shut down.   That was the opposite of recommendations made last week by thelargest Sandamp;L trade group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions,which advocated preserving the current system.   Many members of the league, though, are not healthy enough tojoin the FDIC, which has substantially lower premiums, while abouttwo-thirds of the council's members already are insured by thatagency. No thrifts can switch to the FDIC now anyway because of amoratorium imposed by Congress.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman was unavailable for commentTuesday. However, the American Bankers Association, the largest banktrade group, criticized the council's proposal, saying the group``wants to have its cake and eat it too; They want to leave theproblems of their industry behind ...''   The National Council of Savings Institutions did not provide anyestimates for reaching its goals, although some members indicated itwould cost more than the $30 billion figure suggested by Wall.   ``We think the problem is bigger than that,'' said Keith G.Willoughby, chief executive officer of First Mutual of Boston.   Charles John Koch, head of the First Federal Savings Bank inCleveland and council chairman, said, ``If that's the number thatsolves the problem, great. (But) it's really immaterial. The cost isclearly in excess of what the industry can pay by itself.''   Estimates for dealing with the quarter of the 3,200 federallyinsured Sandamp;Ls that are considered at or near insolvency lately haveranged from $50 billion to $100 billion.   Wall said that while shaky thrifts continue to drag down theindustry, the vast majority of all Sandamp;Ls are profitable because moreand more troubled thrifts have been restructured or merged withhealthy institutions.   He said that industrywide net losses totaled $1.5 billion in thethird quarter, down from $3.8 billion in the second quarter and $3.9billion in the first quarter.   At the same time, the amount of federal income tax paid out bythe profitable thrifts has risen to $573 million in the thirdquarter from $547 million in the second quarter and $490 million inthe first.   Wall said that at the start of this year the bank board, whichregulates federally insured Sandamp;Ls, predicted 52 thrifts would berestructured this year but, in fact, about 200 have been.</TEXT></DOC>
