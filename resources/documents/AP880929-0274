Edelman is about to become an Americanraider in Paris.   With profitable runs on major companies like Lucky Stores andFruehauf Corp. under his belt, Edelman said in a rare interviewthis week that he plans to transplant part of his investmentbusiness overseas, where the takeover environment is less hostileto the hostile.   Despairing over the high prices of U.S. companies and the legalroadblocks that impede the swift stroke of the raider's hand,Edelman said he's looking to become ``very, very active in Europe.''   For at least six months a year, the 48-year-old Edelman plans tomake camp in his computer-equipped Paris apartment and work througha holding company. The Edelman Companies, a menagerie of tradingoperations and limited partnerships, will continue to operate inNew York.   Perhaps to prepare the takeover canvas he intends to paint,Edelman recently bought a 5 percent stake in the Britishconglomerate Lonrho PLC. The foreign press, relatively unacquaintedwith brash, American-style dealmakers, has been humming over justwhat he's up to and why he would want the company, whose mostvaluable assets include the Metropole and Princess hotel chains inBritain, Acapulco, Bermuda and the Bahamas, as well as African goldfields.   The eccentric art collector who's admittedly more comfortable inthe company of ballerinas than bankers is rumored to be courtingother large Lonrho shareholders. Edelman had no comment but notes``there's been no bid.''   Edelman's personal wealth is estimated at about $100 million,and he is believed to have amassed a warchest for takeovers fivetimes that amount. Hence, Lonrho Chief Executive Tiny Rowland said:``We are taking him very seriously.''   Lonrho aside, Edelman has warm words for the Continent. Firstoff, the Common Market lacks the tremendous deficits that theUnited States shoulders. And Europe already has emergedsuccessfully from what Edelman calls ``a social revolution'' thatis only in its embryonic stages here.   He notes that ``European businesses already have faced up totheir social responsibilities,'' like kicking in for employees'medical benefits, something that many American companies haven'tbeen forced to do.   Trade barriers are softening, and European companies have anincreasingly urgent need to expand their share of what in 1992officially will become a single, unified market of more than 300million people.   ``For all of this to work, European companies have to merge,they have to consolidate, they have to go across borders,'' saidEdelman, relaxing in his art-bedecked office.   He also believes European companies are less expensive andrelatively unencumbered by anti-takeover devices like poison pills.Shareholders, he says gleefully, ``have ultimate power over thecompany.''   Edelman is no stranger to Europe. Fluent in French, he spentfour years running the French and Belgian operations of theinvestment firm Carter, Berlind andamp; Weill. He holidays overseasseveral months a year, this summer piloting his yacht through theMediterranean to visit archaeological digs.   The decision to focus more exclusively on Europe came after hisunsuccessful bid for Burlington Industries Inc.last year.   Though he reaped an estimated $60 million, Edelman said the dealdegenerated into a ``horrendous'' and ``saddening'' exchange,punctuated by accusations that he and his partner, Canada'sDominion Textile Inc., had received inside information from aformer Burlington employee.   Ultimately Burlington was taken private, assuming $3 billion indebt in the process. Spokesman Bryant Haskins said the resultingstring of staff reductions and asset sales ``was like curing anin-grown toenail by cutting off a leg.   ``We are still not too happy with Mr. Edelman. We felt thatbeing put into play in a hostile takeover attempt allegedly usinginside information was certainly not the way to go about acquiringa company,'' he said.   For Edelman, the incident convinced him that ``there were justtoo many legal hassles and not enough economic substance to gettingdeals done'' here.   Raised on Long Island's manicured south shore, Edelman earned adegree in economics at Bard College and then moved into thebrokerage business. In 1969 he went out on his own, changing courseover the years from brokering to arbitrage to takeovers whileposting an average net return of 30 percent annually for his fewerthan 100 well-heeled clients.   Edelman not only has challenged the corporate status quo but theacademic status quo as well. Last year, while teaching a course atColumbia University entitled ``Corporate Raiding: The Art of War,''Edelman offered a $100,000 ``finder's fee'' to any student whospotted a takeover target.   Columbia, irked that he would have students do his legwork,forced him to withdraw the offer. But according to Larry Barth, astudent in the class, Edelman ``had no problem mixing academia withcash incentives.''   On Wall Street, Edelman is held in varying degrees of esteem.``Probably in general people have not made a lot of money withAsher like they have with Carl Icahn or Boone Pickens,'' said onearbitrager, whose job it is to follow the dealmakers in betting ontakeover stocks.   ``He's out there for himself, and if you want to come along,that's dandy, but it's caveat emptor,'' said the dealer who spokeon condition of anonymity.   The string of companies that lies in Edelman's wake is lengthy.Fruehauf fended him off in 1986 in a leveraged buyout that resultedin divestitures and an $80 million net loss for the year. AndFoster Wheeler Corp. charged in court last year that Edelman andhis associates manipulated the company's stock in a takeover bid.   Although he won Ponderosa Inc., Edelman sold out at no profitafter cutting overhead and employees. He contends the companieshe's touched are more efficient after such changes.   No one can call Edelman a ``typical'' businessman. He brandshimself _ emphatically so _ as ``avante garde'' and ranks hisinterests pyramid style with family at the top, followed by thearts, the community and business, which is conspicuously last.   Edelman has hand-picked an impressive art collection and spendsat least a full day each week gallery-hopping, sometimes in hischauffeur-driven Jeep.   Swerving through the curved corridors of his office, a visitorcomes upon a secretary working near a large piece of squashedmetal. ``It's a Chamberlain,'' she sighs, referring its creator,John Chamberlain.   Within his 15-room Manhattan apartment, objects d'arte are notconfined to a 57-foot gallery. Indeed, a metal sculpture issuspended above the dining room table _ another Chamberlain.   Recently his eye has strayed from contemporary works toantiquities and European art of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Astestament to his diversity, a second-century sculpture of a Romanemperor has replaced two, 500-pound boxes by Donald Judd, now onloan to the Whitney Museum.   ``He has a real sincere interest in the arts,'' said one formerbusiness associate. ``He's more interesting than many people givehim credit for and can certainly be provocative. I like the factthat he has these pretentions.''</TEXT></DOC>
