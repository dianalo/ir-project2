Robert T. Morris, 24 years old, of Arnold, Md., is the first person to be prosecuted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Justice Department said. Mr. Morris, who is on leave from Cornell, faces as much as five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and could be required to pay restitution for the incident.    The software virus choked thousands of computers at universities and military bases that use the Arpanet computer data network. In the indictment, Mr. Morris is charged with illegally accessing computers at a National Aeronautics and Space Administration computer center; the University of California at Berkeley; Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and other computer sites that aren't specified.    Mr. Morris's attorney, Thomas Guidoboni, said his client would not comment on the indictment. But he said that &quot;after many months of uncertainty, Mr. Morris accepts this event as a step toward the final resolution of this matter.&quot; He said Mr. Morris will plead not guilty and contest the charge. &quot;He looks forward to his eventual vindication and his return to a normal life,&quot; Mr. Guidoboni added.    Mr. Morris told friends that he created the virus program but that he didn't intend for it to spread as quickly and destructively as it did. The virus raced across the network Nov. 2, replicating itself so rapidly that it forced computers to shut down.    Paul Graham, a graduate student in computer science at Harvard University and a friend of Mr. Morris's, said that Mr. Morris is being unfairly used as an example by federal prosecutors eager for their first prosecution under the computer-crime law. &quot;He's an honest person with a genuine interest in computer security, and it was an accident the program spread to all those other computers.&quot;    But computer-industry executives see it differently. Maryanne Karinch, a spokesperson for the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, said that &quot;hacking with criminal intent is not a sophomoric prank but a serious violation of the law.&quot; She said violators &quot;should be punished the same way someone who robs a convenience store should be punished. Computer users have a right to security and privacy, and that is what these statutes are designed to protect.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
