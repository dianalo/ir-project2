The sale, expected to be announced next week, means that RJR will receive a total of $2.35 billion for Del Monte's tropical-fruit and canned-food businesses.    That total falls short of the $3 billion that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which took RJR private in a $25 billion leveraged buy-out, hoped Del Monte would fetch, according to a former RJR executive. &quot;We all knew it was a tough piece to sell,&quot; he said.    He speculated that KKR would next try to sell the Planters LifeSavers business, and may eventually have to sell parts of its domestic Nabisco business. That business, along with the tobacco company, are considered RJR's crown jewels, and assets that KKR has said it wants to keep.    Though the total price was lower than hoped for, the Del Monte sales seem to keep RJR on track toward a goal of selling $5.5 billion in food assets within the first year after the buy-out.    The asset sales will play a big part in determining the buy-out's success. The first major sale, a $2.5 billion purchase of five European food businesses by BSN S.A. in France, was far above expectations.    RJR yesterday confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal that it plans to sell the Del Monte tropical-fruit unit, which sells bananas and pineapples, for $875 million to Polly Peck International PLC.    RJR bonds, which moved up substantially in price since the buy-out was completed last spring, inched up slightly in reaction to the tropical-fruit sale news.    The price &quot;wasn't out of line. So this continues a trend of adequate prices being received, confirming that cash flow will be more than adequate to service the debt,&quot; said Roy Burry, a beverage and tobacco analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    The sale of the canned-food division, which sells canned fruits and vegetables, doesn't include Del Monte's Canadian operations, but does include the businesses in the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and the Far East. RJR plans to keep the Canadian business, which could by itself be worth $100 million or more.    Although less than hoped for, a former RJR food executive said the final sale price for Del Monte was nonetheless &quot;good&quot; for KKR. Before the sale of the tropical-fruit unit was disclosed, word had been out that KKR was having trouble selling Del Monte in one piece and might resort to selling it at a lesser price to somebody else to break up, another former RJR executive said.    The Del Monte purchase would be the largest buy-out for the Citicorp unit, a midsized buy-out organization whose largest previous transaction was a $1.35 billion buy-out in December 1986 of Reliance Electric Corp., which Citicorp Venture led with Prudential-Bache Securities Corp., according to Securities Data Corp.    The two-part Del Monte auction was orchestrated by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. In addition to advising Citicorp on the purchase, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. is expected to assist in the financing, which is likely to involve a sale of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.    The canned-food sale price is 1.3 times the company's expected $1.9 billion sales, but only nine times its expected 1989 pretax operating profit of $160 million. But the numbers aren't strictly comparable because the Canadian unit isn't being sold.    The tropical-fruit sale price was also 1.3 times sales and 13 times expected 1989 operating earnings of $70 million. But if the $200 million value of ships which Del Monte has already bought and paid for, and which Polly Peck plans to sell, is subtracted from the $875 million price tag, the multiple of earnings would be only 10. </TEXT></DOC>
