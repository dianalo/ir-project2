A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., will soon decidewhether the trust's policies force victims to forgo trials orarbitrations when they are unhappy with settlement offersfrom the trust. The policies were upheld in June by JudgeRobert H. Merhige of Richmond, the architect of thecompensation fund who is overseeing its operations.</LP><TEXT>   The controversy is a low point in relations between thetrust and claimants in what was conceived as an innovativeplan to resolve thousands of Shield-related injury claims.The trust evolved out of the reorganization of A.H. RobinsCo., the maker of the contraceptive device, which filed forbankruptcy protection to freeze thousands of productliability suits in 1985.   The Shield was used by an estimated 3.9 million womenworld-wide between 1971 and 1974, even as Robins became awarethat it caused severe gynecological infections, oftenresulting in infertility. The trust fund was designed toencourage settlements of claims and to promote arbitrationinstead of trials.   So far, about 80% of the claimants are settling amicably,according to the trust. The continuing dispute involves womenclaiming severe injuries who are getting low settlementoffers, usually because of missing or inadequate medicalrecords.   When they voted to approve the reorganization plan in1988, women were promised they would be free to contest lowsettlement offers, either through binding arbitration or byjury trial. But according to arguments filed by Baltimoreattorney Michael Pretl and 34 other claimants' attorneys, thetrust has drafted arbitration rules to its own advantage.Under the trust's rules, arbitrations will be governed byVirginia law instead of the laws of the state where theindividual suits were filed. Lawyers for the trust maintainthat a single legal standard is more efficient, but lawyersfor claimants point out that Virginia law is among thenation's most restrictive toward plaintiffs.   The trust has also drafted a three-year statute oflimitations for bringing claims to arbitration, meaning thatany claims brought after that period would be invalid.According to the rules, the clock starts ticking when aclaimant discovers, &quot;or reasonably should have discovered,&quot;an injury that was a ground for a suit.   Trust lawyers argue that the standard is one of the mostflexible in the country. But lawyers for claimants say itcould result in thousands of valid claims being rejected.Evidence of the Shield's defects was concealed from consumersand became widely known only after lawyers suing Robinsobtained internal documents. A more generous approach,claimants' lawyers argue, would start the clock on the day aclaimant discovered that her injury was caused by a defectiveproduct.   Claimants who feel at a disadvantage under thesearbitration rules will opt for more expensive jury trials,their lawyers say. The result will be added costs for thetrust and a further depletion of fund assets intended forvictims.   Trust officials say that 20% of the women who haverejected settlement offers have elected binding arbitration.Eighty percent want jury trials, but most of those claimantsalready had suits pending when Robins filed for bankruptcyprotection, according to Michael Sheppard, the trust'sexecutive director.   Perhaps more controversial, however, is the trust'sso-called holdback policy, whereby a $10,000 cap has been puton jury and arbitration awards until the trust is sure it hasenough money to satisfy all remaining 40,000 active claims.Litigants awarded more than $10,000 still could face years ofdelay before receiving full compensation.   Lawyers for the trust say the holdback is necessarybecause of the possibility of big arbitration or jury awardsdepleting the fund. The trust's priority, says GeorgeneVairo, a professor at Fordham University School of Law andthe trust's chairman, is to preserve assets.   But Public Citizen Litigation Group, a Washington, D.C.,public interest law group representing claimants, maintainsin legal papers that the provision is intended to bludgeonclaimants into forgoing litigation and accepting settlementoffers. The trust has not submitted any evidence that itsassets are -- or even might be -- insufficient, contendsPublic Citizen Director Alan Morrison.   In June, Judge Merhige rejected those arguments.Subsequently, he met with trust officials to review financialdata without notifying lawyers for claimants. In September,he filed a three-paragraph order affirming his decision butsealed a summary of the information he was shown, saying itwas highly confidential.   That alone constituted a violation of due process,according Mr. Morrison, because claimants were not given achance to challenge the data. Trust lawyers counter thatJudge Merhige said in May that he would seek additional datahe needed to justify the holdback and that no lawyers forclaimants objected.   ---   PHOTOCOPYING OF NEWSLETTER is banned by court for thefirst time.   A federal judge in Dallas permanently stopped Enmark GasCorp., a Dallas-based gas distributor, from &quot;cover-to-coverphotocopying and facsimile transmission&quot; of Gas Daily, anewsletter published by Pasha Publications Inc., Arlington,Va.   Judge A. Joe Fish ruled that Enmark infringed Pasha'scopyright by distributing copies to employees without thepublisher's permission. The ruling is the first court victoryfor newsletter publishers, who have launched an offensiveagainst what they call an epidemic of illegal newsletterphotocopying by business subscribers.   Several copyright infringement lawsuits brought bynewsletter publishers have been settled out of court andothers are pending. But until now, the question of whether asubscriber is entitled to make a few copies of a newsletterand distribute them in-house had been left unanswered bycourts.   Under the federal copyright law's fair use doctrine,photocopying for research and noncommercial use is permitted.Courts have found, for example, that the doctrine protects acollege professor who copies portions of journals or booksfor scholarly research, but not if multiple copies will bedistributed to students.   Newsletter publishers argue that the law does not protectbusinesses that distribute full photocopies of newsletters toemployees, because that cheats them of additionalsubscribers. Subscribers counter that the practice is properbecause publishers don't lose substantial revenue and mayeven be helped by the increased exposure their newslettersreceive.   Judge Fish ruled that Enmark's unauthorized copying &quot;hadan obvious detrimental effect on the potential market for GasDaily.&quot;   Lee Levin, a partner with Ross, Dixon andamp; Masback inWashington, which represented Pasha Publications, said theparties had settled the case contingent on the ruling andthat no appeal is expected. He said the terms of thesettlement prohibited him from disclosing whether Enmark willpay damages.   Neal Tomlin, a partner with the Tulsa, Okla., law firmBaker andamp; Hoster, which represented Enmark, noted that JudgeFish found the company was unaware that its actions wereimproper.
