The department's Soil Conservation Servicesaid that based on snowpack and precipitation data, stream flows are expectedto be less than 70 percent of normal in all or parts of eight states: all ofCalifornia and Nevada, central Utah, south-central Idaho, northwesternColorado, southern and eastern Oregon, eastern Wyoming and central Arizona.;   William Richards, SCS chief, said the below-average forecasts result frombelow-average precipitation last fall and snowpack accumulations this winter.For some areas, 1991 could be the fifth consecutive year of below-averagestream flows. Other parts of the West were said to have &quot;received good fallprecipitation and early snowpack accumulation.&quot; The agency said three states-- Colorado, New Mexico and Washington -- report reservoir water suppliesabove 100 percent of the average level. Reservoirs were lowest in Nevada at 8percent of average.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  EXPERTS PREDICT LOW STREAM FLOW IN MUCH OFWEST  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  National News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910124  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  159  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 24, 199100024296,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
