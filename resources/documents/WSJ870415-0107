However, the officials' comments, their toughest talk in the two countries' latest trade dispute, were coupled with statements that reflected reluctance to take such action.    Masaji Yamamoto, deputy director-general of the MITI bureau that oversees the electronics industry, said: &quot;It is a fact we are giving abrogation of the treaty really serious consideration.&quot; But he said that nothing had been decided and that &quot;it is a misinformed reading&quot; to believe that the Japanese government will take drastic steps. &quot;It would hurt our credibility if we abrogated the treaty,&quot; he said.    U.S. trade officials said they don't believe Japan is seriously considering abrogating the pact. Doing so could cost Japan more than the expected sanctions because it would revive anti-dumping suits against leading Japanese computer chip makers and reopen a broader unfair-trade case against the same producers, the officials said. Also, Japanese withdrawal from the semiconductor pact could provoke Congress to consider even harsher trade legislation, they added.    The Reagan administration is urging Japan to continue working within the framework of the semiconductor accord, even though Japan says the U.S. is acting unfairly in planning to impose 100% tariffs on $300 million of Japanese electronics goods on Friday.    &quot;It's a good agreement, one in the best interests of both countries,&quot; said Gary Holmes, a spokesman of the U.S. trade representative's office. &quot;It just hasn't been completely implemented so far.&quot;    Tokyo has said that it intends to protest the sanctions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the multilateral agreement that sets ground rules for international trade. The suit could be filed this week, Japanese government officials said.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter told a Washington breakfast meeting of reporters yesterday that he wouldn't view Japan's taking the semiconductor dispute to GATT as &quot;a hostile action.&quot; He said: &quot;I would be comfortable personally with a GATT challenge,&quot; though he emphasized that the U.S. would defend its interests in the case.    The U.S. plans to impose the sanctions because it believes Japan has failed to fulfill the two nations' eight-month-old semiconductor agreement, which is meant to regulate Japanese sales of computer chips. The U.S. says it has trade data indicating that Japan has been selling semiconductors below cost on world markets, while keeping its own market restricted. U.S. and Japanese negotiators failed to resolve the dispute -- and avoid sanctions -- in Washington last week.    The Japanese government believes that it has abided by the semiconductor pact's conditions. Japan contends the U.S. is using six-month-old market data to calculate semiconductor prices. Those calculations support U.S. charges that Japanese companies are dumping products in Southeast Asia and Europe.    Japan complains that the U.S. won't share the data it has collected to support its conclusion that Japan must be punished. &quot;It seems the U.S. isn't amenable to common sense,&quot; Mr. Yamamoto said.    Japan also says it is living up to the second element of the chip accord -- allowing U.S. semiconductor makers a larger share of the Japanese market. Japan says U.S. makers' share of its home market rose about 15% in the October-March period from the prior six months. And Japan says U.S. concerns' share of the Japanese market rose to 11.2% in 1987's first quarter from 10.5% in the fourth quarter.    The agreement doesn't set a market share that U.S. companies must attain, but the Japanese government says that the U.S. side &quot;presupposes that there is some percentage of market share to which the U.S. producers are entitled.&quot;    MITI has already ordered Japanese companies to cut production of certain kinds of chips as much as 32% from the levels of 1986's fourth quarter. It also says it is trying to make it more difficult to sell chips in unofficial &quot;gray-market&quot; transactions.    There has been speculation that the U.S. would lift its sanctions after just a few weeks in exchange for concessions by Japan on other trade issues. But Mr. Yamamoto said Washington hasn't indicated that to MITI.    ---   Eduardo Lachica in Washington contributed to this article.    ---   Nakasone Sales-Tax Stance   Special to The Wall Street Journal    TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said his Liberal Democratic Party will continue to push for a 5% sales tax despite setbacks in local elections Sunday that are viewed as a rejection of the proposed levy.    Mr. Nakasone made the remarks to the budget committee of parliament's lower house after a Socialist Party member demanded that the proposed sales tax, which is now before parliament, be scrapped because of apparent voter discontent.    The budget committee convened yesterday after a four-week standstill in parliamentary deliberations on the budget for the fiscal year that began April 1. The deadlock has resulted from opposition party protests against the tax, which if approved would take effect next Jan. 1 as part of a package that includes corporate and personal income tax cuts.    Leaders of Mr. Nakasone's ruling party agreed at a meeting earlier this week that the party's setback in the local elections was primarily a result of voter criticism of the planned sales tax. They decided, however, that the tax shouldn't be withdrawn. </TEXT></DOC>
