With this model, it is possible to predictthe dimensions of many more fibers than it is practical to measure bytypical electron microscopic techniques. Thus, sample mass extrapolations,required for animal implantation studies, can be based on a much largernumber of particles, reducing error that could occur, for example, fromthe presence of one or two very large particles. The model assumes alinear relationship between length and width. The number of fibers predictedin each length category is determined from the measure data. Particlelengths were randomly chosen within size classes, and the correspondingwidths were predicted using the model. The similarity of the predictedpopulation to the actual population was tested by comparing the widthdistributions using the chi-square test at the 90% confidence level.Model populations ranging from 250 to 10,000 particles were predicted.Those populations with 2500 or more fibers were similar to the actualsample in their size characteristics. Predicted populations in excessof 75,000 fibers were required to produce consistent sample masses.</TEXT></DOC>
