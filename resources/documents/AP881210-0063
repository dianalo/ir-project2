He did not elaborate.   Fadlallah was quoted by the An Nahar Arab and International, aweekly based in Christian east Beirut. None of the magazine'sprevious reports about the hostages have proved accurate.   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for Shiite extremistfactions holding most of the foreign hostages.   Fourteen foreign hostages are being held in Lebanon, includingnine Americans. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March16, 1985.   In addition, Peter Winkler, a Swiss Red Cross worker, wasabducted Nov. 17 in southern Lebanon, but no group has claimedresponsibility.   In a separate report today, An Nahar said Hezbollah hadthreatened to kill some of the hostages to stop attacks on itspositions in west and south Beirut by the rival, Syrian-backedShiite Amal militia last month.   The magazine did not identify the hostages Hezbollah allegedlythreatened to kill or give further details.   The rival factions have long been vying for dominance of the 1million Shiites who make up the largest single sect of Lebanon'spopulation of 4 million.</TEXT></DOC>
