Itwill not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;will not result in a major increase in costs or prices to consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local agencies, or geographic regions; andwill not have a significant adverse impact on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. This Part applies to Federal Government agencies. In accordance with theRegulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, it is hereby certified that this proposedrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This rule does not contain information requirements that are subject tothe Paper Work Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and OMB implementingregulations 5 CFR part 1320. The regulation in this Part provides guidance to Federal agencies whichmay or may not take an action which could be subject to environmental documentationrequirements. The guidance has no environmental consequences and it isdetermined, under FEMA's regulation published in 44 CFR 10.8, that it isnot necessary to prepare either an environmental assessment or an environmentalimpact statement. In promulgating these rules, FEMA has considered the President's ExecutiveOrder on Federalism issued on October 26, 1987 (E.O. 12612, 52 FR 41685).The purpose of the order is to assure the appropriate division of governmentalresponsibilities between national government and the States. Among otherprovisions, this rule implements the requirements that agency rules bein accordance with the so-called common rule, adopted by FEMA at 44 CFRpart 13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and CooperativeAgreements to State and local Governments. The problem dealt with in thisPart is national in scope. In view of the joint Federal-State responsibilityfor civil defense, and FEMA's role under the Federal Civil Defense Actof 1950, as amended, the regulation in this Part is determined to conformFEMA assistance to Executive Order 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 335 </ITAG>National defense, National security emergency, Protection of essentialresources and facilities.Accordingly, Subchapter E, Chapter I, Title 44, Code of Federal Regulations,is proposed to be amended by adding a new part 335 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 335_PROTECTION OF ESSENTIAL RESOURCES AND FACILITIES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">335.1 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">335.2 Scope and applicability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">335.3 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">335.4 Policy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">335.5 Responsibilities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">335.6 Criteria. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">335.7 Implementation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">335.8 Reporting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>National Security Act of 1947, as amended, 50 U.S.C.404; Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, 50 U.S.C.
