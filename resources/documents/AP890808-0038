Castillo, who pledged to eradicate drug production in Mexico,spoke at the end of a day of talks that featured an unusuallyhigh-level U.S. delegation headed by Secretary of State James A.Baker III and four other Cabinet members.   The talks produced no major accords but served to lay thegroundwork for a Salinas visit to Washington at the beginning ofOctober and the new mood of cooperation.   ``The United States has no more important relationship than withits neighbor and friend, the Republic of Mexico. These are not merewords _ they represent the solemn commitment of the UnitedStates,'' Baker said.   Baker praised the new Mexican administration's vigor in the waron drugs, saying it had made clear ``it wants to tear the roots ofthe opium poppy and marijuana plant from its soil.''   ``Mexico's success over the past six months in capturing andprosecuting drug traffickers has seized the world's attention,''Baker said.   Mexico has been a principal source of heroin and marijuana and atransit point for U.S.-bound cocaine. U.S. officials have saidcorruption in the Mexican government prevented aggressive pursuitof traffickers.   A former Mexican police officer was convicted in the UnitedStates last year in the 1985 torture-slaying of U.S. drug agentEnrique Camarena. Another Mexican policeman was indicted in thecase last month.   Mexican officials have long insisted that cutting U.S. demand isthe key to the problem.   The Bush administration ``knows all too well that 60 percent ofthe world's illegal drug supply is consumed in the United States,''Baker said. ``This senseless demand must be cut through the effortsof all Americans.''   The U.S. recognition that it must cut the demand for drugs isvital to the new spirit of cooperation, Foreign Minister FernandoSolana said.   Officials on both sides noted the positive new tone after yearsof misunderstanding, disagreement and mutual recrimination that ahigh-ranking Salinas administration official described as at timeshaving been a ``dialogue of the deaf.''   Baker and Treasury Secretary Nicolas Brady praised the economicpolicies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whoseadministration has been in office eight months.   Brady hailed the debt reduction agreement Mexico reached withcommercial banks two weeks ago and the steps it has taken toencourage foreign investment and lower trade barriers. Payments onthe country's $107 billion foreign debt have contributed to a sharpdecline in living standards the past seven years.   Baker said Mexico has become an economic model for other debtornations because of Salinas' ``bold far-sighted policies.''   After two decades of 6 percent growth, the economy completelystagnated under Salinas' predecessor, President Miguel de laMadrid, in part due to an austerity program put into effect to keepup with debt payments.   But despite efforts to encourage non-petroleum exports, reducegovernment deficit spending and cut inflation, the economy hasremained in the doldrums. Combined unemployment and underemploymentis estimated at 40 percent.   Other U.S. officials joining Baker and Brady for the talks underthe auspices of the U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission includedAttorney General Richard Thornburgh, Commerce Secretary RobertMosbacher, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and FBI directorWilliam Session.   Also on the agenda were issues relating to the U.S.-Mexicanborder, the environment, fisheries, trade and investment andcultural ties.</TEXT></DOC>
