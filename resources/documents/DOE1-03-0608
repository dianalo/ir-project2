We developed an economic model to examine the relative importanceof several key economic and engineering factors that firms consider whendeciding whether to cogenerate. The model determines the amount of cogeneratedelectricity produced and the total electricity used by a plant as a functionof economic and engineering factors that influence a plant's demand forand marginal cost of electricity. The analytical results suggest thatpolicy actions concerning industrial cogeneration turn on electricityprices and external factors that affect the plant's marginal cost ofcogenerating. The buy-back rate, considered by some to be an importantfactor in determining the amount of cogeneration, was found to be importantin determining the amount of cogenerated power only when the plant meetscertain economic and engineering conditions. 10 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
