<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0227 </DOCNO><TEXT>A stochastic, dynamic programming model, RAPSODY, which is designed toanalyse and determine optimal operating strategies for a hybrid electricitygenerating system comprising up to three diesel sets with optional batterystorage and augmented by variable wind or photo-voltaic power is described.The model takes capital, operating and maintenance, and fuel costs intoaccount to assess the optimal operating strategy for the auxiliary andto calculate the average daily cost of satisfying an electrical loadprofile which may also contain a stochastic element. In doing so, thedecreased fuel efficiency and lifetime of the diesel set as it is operatedbelow full capacity is explicitly taken into consideration as is a furtherimportant cost component attributable to switching on. The model is providedwith an efficient optimizing routine which allows the user to obtainoptimal component sizes for a particular load profile and wind or solarresource.</TEXT></DOC>
