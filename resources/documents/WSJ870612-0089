Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska) has held an interest in a Fairbanks refinery that relies on Alaska's North Slope oil while he has advocated opening more of the North Slope to oil development.    The senator didn't specifically report his interest in the Petro Star Inc. refinery in his Senate financial disclosure forms. But he asserted he disclosed it by referring in the forms to partnership holdings &quot;in resource development.&quot;    Sen. Murkowski's connection to the refinery was made public by Charles Hamel, an Alexandria, Va. oil broker, who claimed it represented a conflict of interest and urged that the senator withdraw from the North Slope oil issue. Sen. Murkowski conceded that he knew the interest was held for him as recently as last year in a &quot;blind&quot; trust, but denied it posed any conflict. He asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review the matter. Meanwhile, he presided yesterday over a hearing on the North Slope issue.    The refinery obtains crude oil from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which would shut down if North Slope production runs out. North Slope production is expected to begin declining next year.    Sen. Murkowski currently is the chief Senate sponsor of a bill to open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration and development. According to his staff, he has been advocating that position since coming to the Senate in 1981. Further oil development on the North Slope could extend the life of the pipeline, and hence of the refinery.    Mr. Hamel charged in a letter to Sen. Murkowski that passage of his bill &quot;will help to ensure the continued profitability of Petro Star far into the future, to your personal and substantial economic benefit.&quot;    Sen. Murkowski asked the ethics panel for a prompt review of the matter because of his involvement in hearings on oil development on the North Slope. He said the panel also has received an allegation that he received the refinery interest as a gift. He denied that, saying his partnership, Frontiers-Alaska, paid $178,000 for its 10% share.    Sen. Murkowski's support for oil development in the refuge isn't surprising. Alaska relies heavily on the oil industry for tax revenue and jobs, and development is favored by the state's governor and its two other members of Congress.    In 1983, the Ethics Committee advised Sen. Murkowski in response to his questions that he was free to participate in Frontiers-Alaska and other partnerships only as long as they didn't present conflicts with his senatorial duties.    His tie to the refinery came through the one-third of Frontiers-Alaska held by him and his wife. Frontiers-Alaska obtained 10% of the shares of Petro Star on April 29, 1985, according to Petro Star's president, Stephen Lewis. One month earlier, Sen. Murkowski put his Frontiers-Alaska holding into a blind trust. In an interview, he denied that the purpose of the trust was to avoid reporting his refinery interest; he said the trust was formed to avoid &quot;inaccurate&quot; press reports on his holdings and to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest.    But he wasn't unaware of his ownership in the refinery. His wife, Nancy, didn't put her Frontiers-Alaska interest into such a trust until April 9, 1986, almost a year after Frontiers-Alaska obtained an interest in the refinery. Moreover, the senator said he knew before he established his trust that Frontiers-Alaska was trying to establish the refinery company. And he said he later learned from other partners in Frontiers-Alaska about his investment in the refinery, which was built in 1985 outside his home town of Fairbanks.    Despite this, in May 1986 he reported in his Senate disclosure that the Frontiers-Alaska holdings he placed in trust included only real estate and &quot;interests in resource development.&quot; In an interview, he said he intended that phrase to disclose his holding in Petro Star.    The Ethics Committee's disclosure instructions call for reporting lawmakers' holdings and &quot;the nature of the business&quot; they do. The instructions aren't clear about how specific such identification must be, however. Bonnie Parker, staff administrator of the ethics panel, declined to comment on whether Sen. Murkowski's disclosure was adequate.    A Frontiers-Alaska filing listed Juneau attorney James Clark as &quot;trustee&quot; for one of its partners as of February 1986. Mr. Clark is the trustee of Sen. Murkowski's blind trust. The senator said he doesn't know if Mr. Clark has sold his interest, as he is authorized to do without telling the senator. Petro Star's Mr. Lewis said he believed Sen. Murkowski remains a part owner of Frontiers-Alaska through &quot;some kind of trust.&quot;    Even before 1985, Sen. Murkowski valued his Frontiers-Alaska interests at more than $250,000. The partnership is the second largest Petro Star shareholder. Mr. Lewis estimated the current value of the refinery at $6 million to $8 million. He declined to discuss its revenues or earnings.    Mr. Lewis said the refinery taps about 6,500 barrels of crude oil a day from the pipeline to make diesel fuel and heating oil. It has contracts to continue that crude supply through early 1996, he said. He asserted that he is &quot;fairly confident&quot; that the refinery can obtain crude for some time after that date, but added, &quot;nine and a half years from now I'll worry about it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
