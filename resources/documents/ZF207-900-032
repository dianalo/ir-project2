(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LANs are growing both locally and remotely.andP;  Just as the users on differentfloors of the same building or different buildings on the same campus wantaccess to each other's resources, users in different Cities or states want tobenefit as well.andP;  The more users and devices that are added to the LAN, themore bandwidth that is consumed.andP;  Ethernet users are complaining that10M-bits-per-second is not enough.andP;  16M-bits-per-second Token Ring isgrowing, albeit slowly.andP;  The amount of information sent back and forth isincreasing.andP;  The number of network locations is growing.andM;Building a wide-area network is more complex than a local one.andP;  It involvesthe expertise of not only the LAN group, but the telecom group as well.andO;Management and support is more difficult simply because of the geographicdistance.andP;  Reliability is an issue, because for the most part your companydoes not have control over the links between the LANs; the various telephonecompanies do.andP;  As for the actual link, anything from a dial-up line to T-1 tosatellite may fit your needs.andP;  The type of link you buy depends on yournetwork geography, construction, applications and budget.andM;If only a few users need infrequent access to a particular host or LAN,modems and asynchronous dial-up lines are the best bet.andP;  Although theconnection will be slow, it will be inexpensive.andP;  Running LAN applicationsinteractively will be tedious, so it is best for users to transfer the files,work on them locally, and transfer them back when they are done.andP;  Users whoare accustomed to the fast response times of the LAN will find even a19.2K-bits-per-second modem slow.andM;So don't be surprised when users complain the dial-up lines are not enough.andO;When the company is spending a big chunk of money giving each user a dial-upline and modems, a communication server will allow users to share thosemodems and lines.andP;  But once the line's capacity becomes a problem, leasedlines, X.25 and T-1 provide larger bandwidth.andP;  There are also more exoticservices, including microwave, laser, satellite and ISDN.andM;Leased Lines And T-1andM;Today, the majority of WANs use dial-up and leased lines.andP;  A leased line willprovide you with up to 56K bits per second of bandwidth.andP;  This digitaltelephone line will provide fewer errors and higher reliability than voicegrade lines.andP;  But as demands on the internetwork increase,56K-bits-per-second is going to be constraining.andP;  For that reason, T-1, andspecifically fractional T-1, has piqued the interest of many a WAN manager.andM;T-1 service offers a two-way connection at 1.544M bits per second.andP;  T-1 isfamiliar to those in telecommunications, since many companies use it to buildprivate voice networks.andP;  T-1's bandwidth is divided into 2464K-bits-per-second channels.andP;  Each channel can carry one voice conversation.andO;Each 64K-bits-persecond channel is known as digital signal level zero orDS-0.andM;Although T-1  seems to have an oddandM;bandwidth size,   it makes sense whenandM;you understand its origin.andP;  When T-1 began, it turned  out that 1.5M bits persecond was about the highest rate that could be reliably supported for theone mile distance between manholes in large cities.andP;  The manholes were usedfor splicing cables and offered a site for regenerators.andP;  The convention wasretained when 24 channels were created with time division multiplexing asthey are today.andP;  At 64K bits per second each, the aggregate data rate of 24channels became 1.536M bits per second.andP;  To keep the two multiplexerssynchronized, 8K bits per second were added, making the total 1.544M bits persecond.andP;  This is the standard T-1 rate in North America, Japan and Australia.andO;In European and other CCITT countries, 30 voice and two signalling channelsare multiplexed at the rate of 2.048M bits per second.andP;  Indubitably toconfuse us LAN people, both are called DS-1.andM;Quite often, voice and data are multiplexed over the same T-1 circuit.andP;  Lessfrequently, compressed video for teleconferencing, facsimile and audio areadded to the circuit.andM;T-1 is available from many sources.andP;  Most often the local telephone companyor telco provides the twisted pair wire from each of your offices to thenearest central office where the phone com- pany's switching equipment islocated.andP;  These are called local loops.andP;  If your T-1 circuit is within thelocal area, in telcospeak the LATA or Local Access and Transport Area, thenonly one telco will be involved.andP;  If you have a long T-1 circuit, there maybe different telcos at either end.andP;  These telcos provide access to thecentral offices of a long distance phone company which carries the signalbetween LATAS.andM;In addition to the local loop, an in- traLATA channel will probably beneeded.andP;  An intraLATA channel connects the first central office with theinterLATA carrier's point of service.andP;  ATandamp;T usually has a couple of servingoffices for T-1 service in each LATA.andP;  However, T-1 is not at every centraloffice.andP;  Several rural LATAs have no ATandamp;T point of service at all.andP;  This justincreases the number (and price) of links.andM;The local telephone company can only carry traffic within its assigned LATA.andO;Calls that cross a LATA must be carried by an interLATA or long distancecarrier.andP;  This requirement holds even if the same operating telco controlsthe LATAs at both end points.andP;  A T-1 circuit that crosses a LATA is much moreex- pensive than one that does not.andM;A company can also construct a private T-1 network, which is most often donewith microwave, optical fiber or copper.andM;T-1 And LANsandM;Once largely the domain of the telecommunications group, T-1 has recentlybecome very attractive to MIS and LAN groups.andP;  T-1's usage has only recentlybegun to skyrocket,&quot; according to Tad Witkowicz, president of CrossComm, abridge vendor headquartered in Marlboro, MA.andP;  &quot;This is due to a number ofeconomic factors such as increased competition caused by telephonederegulation, technical advancements in the design of cost effective terminalequipment, and an increasing need for high speed data communicationsservices.andM;&quot;The T-1 service is of particular importance to LAN users because it providesnearly transparent connectivity across long distances,&quot; Witkowicz continues.andO;&quot;Its high speed allows the building of corporate wide networks that connectgeographically distinct LANs in such a way that a virtual LAN is createdwhere users can send data freely and without delays - unlike telephone modems- regardless of their location.&quot;andM;Fractional T-1 is stirring up the most interest for LAN usage, since mostcompanies do not need the full T-1 bandwidth.andP;  Before fractional T-1 wasavailable, if you needed more than 56K of bandwidth but less than 1.544M bitsper second, you had to buy multiple leased lines.andP;  Fractional T-1 willrevolutionize wide-area networking.andP;  With fractional T-1, you can buy T-1 inincrements of 64K bits per second.andP;  The telephone company still runs theentire T-1 line to your site, but you only pay for the channels you order.andO;Fractional T-1 brings the service to many, many more people - potentially allthose who are currently running 56K-bits-per-second leased lines.andM;Fractional T-1 lends itself to expansion.andP;  If you only need 64K bits persecond of bandwidth, you can pay for that now.andP;  Then as your needs expand,you order more.andP;  There's also the possibility of shared tenant services,where several smaller companies in the same building can use differentchannels of the same T-1 line.andM;The T-1 providers are pushing the service heavily.andP;  Rates are dropping allthe time.andP;  A point-to-point link 400 miles long within one LATA of fractionalT-1 from ATandamp;T is actually cheaper than either a leased line or a voice-gradeline.andP;  For comparison purposes, the service charge for a leased line fromATandamp;T over the same distance, called Dataphone Digital Service, costs about$3.86 per month.andP;  This is the cheapest variation of T-1, however.andM;For every $1.00 spent per month on a 56K/64K-bits-per-second line on AccunetT1.5  ATandamp;T's name for fractional T-1), you would spend $1.15 for a voicegradeline.andP;  To install Accunet T1.5, it costs $310 per end, so installing a fullpoint-to-point link over a 400 mile distance is $620.andM;Although per channel, ATandamp;T's T-1 service is cheaper than fractional T-1, youhave to buy all 24 channels.andP;  If you could buy only one channel of AccunetSpectrum  ATandamp;T's name for its full T-1 service), it would cost 69 cents.andP;  Forthe 24 channels, it costs $16.56 per month.andP;  Installation costs areconsiderably higher for full T-1 than for fractional T-1.andP;  To install AccunetSpectrum in 56K- or 64K-bits-per-second channels, it costs $196 per channel.andO;That means for a 400-mile circuit within one LATA, full T-1 will cost nearly$5,000.andP;  For other width channels, called &quot;intermediate rates,&quot; it costs $500per channel.andP;  In other words, ATandamp;T charges you more on a perchannel basiswhen you buy fractional T-1 as opposed to when you buy full T-1.andM;Before ATandamp;T can quote you a price on long distance services, you must tellthe salesperson how many points the WAN should serve, the speed of theapplication, the volume of transmission, the portion of the line that will bein use each day, the amount of time the circuit will be used and thebandwidth.andP;  These parameters are run through ATandamp;T's modelling system.andP;  Thissystem will tell you what the most economical system is, and what T-1 mux]s,channel banks or other &quot;adjunct&quot; equipment you need.andP;  Other local and longdistance telephone service providers will have similar requirements.andM;T-1 and fractional T-1's circuit costs are proportional to distance, so thelonger the haul, the more it costs.andP;  For companies with a metropolitan areanetwork, the cost of T-1 is nominal, as the above example shows.andP;  If two ormore telephone companies are involved, and the T-1 service is interLATA, theFCC Tariff Number 40 applies.andP;  It consists of a fixed portion ($75 to $175per month) and a distance portion (about $30 per mile per month).andM;If you need to connect a LAN, you need a bridge so that only the remotetraffic will be sent over the link.andP;  The bridge is then connected to either achannel bank or a T-1 mux.andP;  A channel bank takes 1.544M bits per second andbreaks it into 24 channels, each 64K bits per second wide.andP;  A channel bank isgenerally used in point-to-point applications.andM;AT-1 multiplexer takes the T-1 bandwidth and breaks it up anyway you want.andP;  Amux allows you to create different sized pipes.andP;  T-1 muxes are frequentlyused when more than one T-1 line is involved.andP;  if the LAN bandwidthrequirements are more than the T-1 channels you have available, some muxescan do compression.andP;  if you are interested in fractional T-1, make sure theT-1 mux can handle it.andP;  Fractional T-1 is new.andM;T-1 MAC-layer bridge makers include 3Com (Mountain View, CA), ACC (SantaBarbara, CA), Alantec (Fremont, CA), CMC (Santa Barbara, CA), Cisco Systems(Menlo Park, CA), CrossComm (Marlboro, MA), Halley Systems (San Jose, CA),Infotron (Cherry Hill, NJ), Microcom (Norwood, MA), Network ApplicationsTechnology (Cupertino, CA), Novell (Provo, UT), RAD Data Communications(Rochelle Park, NJ), TRW (Torrance, CA), Vitalink (Fremont, CA) and Wellfleet(Bedford, MA).andP;  Companies who make routers with T-1 interfaces include 3Com,Cisco Systems, Proteon (Westboro, MA), Ungermann-Bass (Santa Clara, CA),Vitalink and Wellfleet.andP;  Companies such as Newbridge Networks (Herndon, VA)and Timeplex (Woodcliff Lake, NJ) sell T-1 muxes channel banks and other T-1Public Data NetworksandM;Whereas T-1 is used for point-to-point links, X.25 can be used to create amesh network.andP;  X.25, the protocol o packet switched networks, lends itself tointernetworking.andP;  You can receive X.25 service from a public data network(PDN), such as ATandamp;T, Tymnet, Telenet or Infonet  El Segundo, CA), or you maybuild a private packet switched network with a packet switch you buy fromcompanies such as Amnet (Framingham, MA), Micom, or Hewlett-Packard(Cupertino, CA).andM;Because PDNs literally span the globe, X.25 is very popular for internationalinternetworking.andP;  However, X.25 is not nearly as popular within the UnitedStates as it is within Europe.andP;  That is largely because people can getreliable telephone service quickly in the U.S., while getting a leased linein Europe can be difficult and its quality poor.andM;X.25 is the best WAN link for a company with several host computers in itsheadquarters and a large number of branch offices that need access to theLANs and hosts.andP;  &quot;If you have limited data traffic and use the remoteresource less than 20 hours per month, then you are a candidate for X.25,&quot;says Ed Fudurich, vice president of research and development at GatewayCommunications, an X.25 gateway maker located in Irvine, CA.andP;  Industrieswhich typically use X.25 include insurance companies, banks and retailstores.andP;  These types of companies all have many branch offices which need toconnect to a central host.andM;X.25 can also be used to translate among different hosts.andP;  All hostsconnected to an X.25 cloud (i.e., network) must run X.25 software.andP;  X.25becomes a diplomatic language which the hosts all understand and speak.andP;  Thatmeans your VAX and your IBM host - or whatever - can exchange data.andM;X.25 is far more popular for connecting remote terminals to host computersthan for internetworking PC LANS.andP;  One problem is the fastest circuit in theU.S.andP;  is 56K bits per second.andP;  (Some European PDNs go up to 64K bits persecond.) Most users have 9,600 baud or 19.2Kbits-per-second lines to the PDN.andO;These speeds may suit mainframe users, but not PC LAN users.andP;  At such speeds,batch file transfer is more viable than running LAN application softwareinteractively.andM;The US Army Corps of Engineers uses an X.25 gateway to connect LANs and usersto host computers between Omaha, NE and Kansas City, KS.andP;  They are running a19.2K-bits-per-second link which is split into two channels.andP;  Because thelink is slow, &quot;you don't try to run DBASE.andP;  It sends you DBASE as if you wereon a regular LAN, but at a fraction of the speed,&quot; according to NathanHarrington, a programmer/analyst and LAN specialist in the Omaha division ofthe Corps.andP;  Because their traffic levels don't yet justify a T-1 link, theCorps mainly uses the X.25 link to transfer files overnight.andP;  They do not dointeractive work, simply because the link is too slow.andM;For the most part, X.25 users have dedicated lines to the packet switchednetwork.andP;  But if there isn't enough traffic to justify a dedicated line, orthe users are on the road frequently, Dial X.25 or X.32 will allow users todial into a host through an X.25 cloud using an ordinary modem andasynchronous telephone line.andP;  X.25 normally requires a synchronous connectionfrom end to end.andM;Billing should improve with X.75, an upgraded version of X.25 which allowsX.25 carriers to exchange call charge information and customer information.andO;&quot;Ninety percent of calls from terminals to mainframes are billed tomainframes:' says Fudurich.andP;  &quot;The mainframe charges the user once he hasentered the codes.andP;  X.75 will allow for better charge back to customer.andP;  Youwill pay as you use the service.andP;  For example, without being a subscriber youcan dial into Compuserve when you want to get the news and be charged to yourown X.25 connection.andP;  X.75 provides a more open type of interconnectionbetween the users and the service provider.andP;  That applies in spadesinternationally,&quot; say Japan's PDN uses X.75, and others may follow suit.andM;X.25 GatewaysandM;LAN users can't talk through public or private data networks without an X.25gateway.andP;  An X.25 gateway's software and hardware translates LAN protocols tosynchronous packet switched protocols use on an X.25 network.andP;  Then ittransmits them onto the PDN.andP;  Each LAN connected to the X.25 cloud needs anX.25 gateway and synchronous modem.andM;X.25 gateways can be external boxes, while others fit into a PC (but not thefile server).andP;  Of those that fit in a PC, they can be dedicated ornon-dedicated gateways.andP;  Most work with NetBIOS LANs, and some arespecifically designed for NetWare's IPX.andP;  Most claim to be non-dedicated,meaning the PC can be used for another function while serving as the X.25gateway.andP;  However, in practice, it is generally wise to dedicate the PC tobeing the gateway if the load is heavy.andP;  The X.25 gateway PC also hassoftware which packetizes the LAN traffic for transmission over apacketswitched network.andP;  Additionally, if the PC users want to talk to hosts,they must run the appropriate terminal emulation software.andM;An X.25 gateway isn't the only method used to connect a LAN to a PDN.andP;  Youcan use a MAC-layer bridge or router that uses X.25 as its communicationsmethod.andP;  Or you can use a NetB[OS bridge with an X.25 interface.andP;  &quot;MAC-layerbridges tend to be more efficient and more transparent to upperlayerprotocols.andP;  NetBIOS bridges have trouble in getting NetBIOS transportmechanisms which are compatible on both sides.andP;  But in terms of overallefficiency, everything is bottlenecked by the speed of X.25 lines,&quot; saysFudurich.andM;Eicon Technology (Lachine, Quebec), ICOT  Mobile, AL), and Rabbit Software(Malvern, PA) make X.25 gateways for NetBIOS LANS.andP;  Novell sells an X.25gateway for NetWare.andP;  Gateway  Irvine, CA) has X.25 gateways for both NetWareand NetBIOS LANS.andM;Microwave And LaserandM;When building a wide area network, sometimes wire is constraining.andP;  Perhapsbecause of the distance and the way the LATAs are arranged T-1 is tooexpensive.andP;  Perhaps pulling fiber would demand crossing a highway or cuttingthrough rock.andP;  Microwave, laser and satellite are wireless alternatives tothe services provided by long distance companies.andM;Short-haul microwave and laser are largely used to get around a specificproblem, rather than as a corporate direction.andP;  They are used where fiber ortelephone lines are too expensive or too difficult to run, such as under ahighway, across a river or through rock.andP;  Shorthaul microwave and laser areoften used as temporary solutions while waiting for fiber to be pulled.andO;Because the transmission and reception equipment is portable, these types oftransmission lend themselves to being temporary.andM;Both microwave and laser require a line of sight.andP;  That means there can be noobstruction between the two antennae.andP;  The antennae must be placed on top oftall buildings or a tower.andP;  If your company isn't located on top of a tallbuilding, you may be able to rent roof space on some other building.andP;  Bothmicrowave and laser have large bandwidths - large enough to carry acombination of voice, video and data.andM;A microwave link connecting Ethernet LANs cannot be longer than 4.5kilometers, due to Ethernet's propagation delay.andP;  Reliability is a functionof the frequency, distance, rain rate and antennae.andP;  A severe downpour - fourinches of rain an hour - will put out a microwave signal, but such delugesare rare in most parts of North America.andP;  For microwave, each end of the linkrequires an antennae, a microwave transceiver and a MAC-layer bridge.andO;Microwave requires an FCC license, which the microwave link installer shouldprocure for you.andP;  Still, getting frequencies is increasingly difficult incongested spaces like Manhattan.andP;  There is often a long lead time associatedwith the license.andP;  Among others, Digital Equipment Corp. (Maynard, MA) andMicrowave Bypass (Cambridge, MA) supply MAC-layer bridges with microwavetransceivers.andP;  Including the microwave antenna, the link will probably cost$50,000.andM;Laser does not require any FCC licensing, although HUD regulations willapply.andP;  Other laser beams will not interfere with your beam.andP;  In fact, thebeams can cross paths.andP;  Laser can pass through window glass and it cantransmit about a kilometer before the signal degrades severely.andP;  At thatdistance, you can expect about 15 hours of downtime during the year.andO;Extremely heavy fog will block out the laser signal.andP;  Since laser does notrequire  dishes,&quot; but small  cameras,&quot; laser is more aesthetic thanmicrowave.andP;  Like fiber optic LANS, which transmit laser beams within glass,laser out of the cable has potentially huge bandwidth possibilities.andM;Laser Communications' (Lancaster, PA) LACE runs voice, full-motion video andEthernet data over a laser beam.andP;  A Token Ring version is coming.andP;  For theT-1 link, LACE needs a DS-1 signal, which comes from a T-1 mux.andP;  For anEthernet link, repeaters and the LACE transceivers are required.andP;  LaserCommunication's T-1 device costs $12,000.andP;  Its Ethernet device costs $14,00.andM;SatelliteandM;While laser and microwave are short distance solutions, usually alternativesto fiber, satellite is a long distance affair.andP;  Geography or distance mayimpede the usual means of internetworking.andP;  It may be cost-effective tolocate parts of the company outside of major cities.andP;  Or it may be necessaryto communicate with divisions overseas.andP;  These remotely-located people maynot be able to get high-speed data circuits.andP;  Or they may not be able to gettelephone service at all.andP;  This is where satellite may make sense.andP;  Satellitelinks are popular in the mining, construction and timber industries,according to Frank McCarthy, vice president of sales and marketing at Vitacom(Mountain View, CA), a maker of LAN satellite links.andM;Satellite is attractive to those who demand a very high quality link.andP;  &quot;Wecan provide a bit error rate of 10 to the minus seven, or one in ten million&quot;says McCarthy.andP;  &quot;Satellite is important for scientific groups since theyrequire a very high level of quality.&quot;andM;Satellite provides speeds up to T-1, and multiple T-1 channels can be run offthe same satellite hub.andP;  According to McCarthy, most of Vitacom's customersare operating at 64K, 112K and 228K bits per second, rather than full T-1speeds.andM;The greatest difference between satellite and terrestrial circuits is thetime delay.andP;  The closest an earth station can ever be to a satellite is22,300 miles, and that's only if the earth station is on the equator directlybeneath the satellite.andP;  All U.S.andP;  earth stations are farther away, leading toa long two-way transit time.andP;  Even at the speed of light, there is a 1/4second of delay between earth stations.andP;  The round trip delay is 1/2 second,from the user's point of view.andM;Data traffic must account for this time very carefully.andP;  Protocols have to beset to accommodate the long time between the transmission of the data and thereceiver's acknowledgment.andP;  Any additional delay, like processing time at thefar end, could mislead the protocol at the sending end to time out.andP;  This maylead to a reset or an outage.andP;  LAT, DEC's terminal server protocol, is one ofthe troublesome protocols.andP;  LAT's name is very descriptive; it really is alocal area transport.andM;While the WAN at the Defense Systems Group and Underseas Division ofHoneywell is made mostly of bridges and T-1 links, there is one satellitelink between Minneapolis, MN and Joliet, IL.andP;  Although Mike Miller, a seniordata communications analyst at Honeywell, has found the T-1 links reliableand speedy, he is not equally content with the satellite link.andP;  &quot;Thesatellite seems to be much slower than the terrestrial links.andP;  Some peoplesay it's due to the protocols we are running.&quot; Honeywell used a satellitelink because the cost of running a T-1 or 56K-bits-per-second leased linefrom the western suburbs of Minneapolis to Joliet was too high.andP;  &quot;It wasalmost impossible to go with a T-1 or 56K line.andP;  That's mainly because of thefacilities in Joliet,&quot; says Miller.andM;And while Honeywell has not experienced any problems with the T-1 links,Miller says, &quot;Every times it rains in Joliet, we have a problem.andP;  We call tofind out why the link isn't working, and they tell us it's raining there,&quot; helaments.andM;There are two types of satellite: VSAT and SCPC.andP;  VSAT or Very Small ApertureTerminal is very expensive.andP;  Single Carrier Per Channel satellite is morefrequently used for LANS.andP;  Although SCPC sends directly, it can be used inbroadcast mode.andP;  Although all devices hear the message, only those to whichpackets are addressed can pick up.andP;  It can be configured so that thebroadcast is one way only.andP;  Or the remote stations can send data back to thehub, or selectively to other stations via the hub.andM;Although costs depend on a number of variables, to install a basic56K-bits-per-second circuit to a 1.8 meter station in an outlying area willcost about $40,000.andP;  You will need a MAC-layer bridge or router, a satellitetransceiver and an antenna.andP;  You can either buy your own hub station, or usethe satellite company's.andP;  Hughes Network Systems (Germantown, MD) is a majorprovider of satellite services and equipment.andM;ISDNandM;ISDN, or Integrated Services Digital Network, will revolutionizecommunications, some claim.andP;  Those on the other side of the fence argue thatISDN is a solution looking for a problem.andP;  &quot;Over the next two to five years,ISDN will become a part of a company's overall communications strategy,&quot;predicts Jim Borton, product manager for ISDN at NCR Personal ComputerDivision in Dayton, OH.andP;  &quot;They're going to evaluate it, and those who want itwill incorporate it into their bag of tricks where it applies, just as theydo now.andP;  I don't think ISDN is an answer to everyone's needs for everysituation.&quot;andM;Although ISDN is not a panacea, there are situations where it can be ideal.andO;Borton points to two: server-to-server and gateways.andP;  PC LANs can betransparently connected through ISDN, or they may be connected to a hostcomputer.andP;  In these applications, ISDN can be a viable alternative to dial-upand leased lines.andP;  Instead of using a 9,600 baud or 19.2K-bits-per-secondleased line, ISDN's basic rate line may be cheaper and have betterthroughput.andP;  Basic rate is 2B+D.andP;  Each B channel is 64K bits per second wideand can be used for voice or data.andP;  The D channel is 16K bits per second wideand it is for signalling information, call setup or packet switched servicelike X.25.andP;  Primary rate ISDN services will be used for host-to-host andLAN-to-host connections, where a data highway needs to be constructed.andO;Primary rate, as opposed to basic rate, has 23 B channels at 64K bits persecond each and a D channel 64K bits per second wide.andM;Much of ISDN's success will depend on its pricing.andP;  The cost depends on thetariff of the local service provider and the manufacturers of the hardwareand software needed to make the LAN- to-ISDN connection.andP;  There are very fewISDN lines installed anywhere in the U.S., except for Chicago.andP;  Also, ISDNequipment from the various vendors are not necessarily compatible.andM;ISDN will not replace LANs as the local transport.andP;  LAN users are accustomedto the speedy services of Ethernet and Token Ring.andP;  Basic rate will not sateLAN users.andP;  Primary rate is too expensive.andP;  It would be like giving each userhis or her own T-1 line.andP;  ISDN may be used as an alternative to LANs wherethe bandwidth requirements are very small, such as for an E-mail network.andM;WIDE-AREA NETWORKING OPTIONSandM;* Voice-grade lines: Dial-up lines are good for occasional links to remoteresources.andP;  They're inexpensive, but only good for low bandwidthapplications.andP;  Need asynchronous modems and voice-grade telephone lines.andM;* Digital leased lines: Speeds up to 56K-bits-per-second.andP;  Good for WANs witha medium amount of traffic.andP;  Need synchronous modems and lines.andM;* Fractional T-1: Speeds range from 64K- to 1.544M-bits-per-second.andP;  Order inincrements of 64K-bits-per-second.andP;  if conditions are right, fractional T-1ca be cheaper than dial-up or leased lines.andM;* T-1: Good for high-bandwidth applications.andP;  Data is often multiplexed overT-1 line with voice, fax or video traffic.andP;  Can be very expensive.andP;  Requireslines from telephone company, plus channel bank or T-1 mux.andM;* Microwave; Good as a temporary solution or where the cost of running fiberor using telephone lines is too high.andP;  Often used to get around an obstacle,such as rock.andP;  Need line-of-site between antennae, microwave bridge and FCClicense.andM;* Laser: Similar to microwave, except an FCC license is not required.andO;Maximum distances are shorter than with short-haul microwave.andM;* Satellite: Used to build a WAN which reaches geographically isolated placeswhere telephone service is very poor or nonexistent.andP;  Need satellite bridge,earth station and satellite.andM;* ISDN: Offers simultaneous voice and data to the desktop.andP;  Basic rate usedfor LAN to LAN connections, primary rate used for LAN to host and host tohost links.andP;  ISDN equipment is not standardized-I ISDN rates are not set.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
