It has torecognize that people have both independent and collaborative needs in thecreation and production of documents,'' Hild said.andM;XyQuest's own LAN word processor, XyWrite III Plus, includes an editingfeature called ''multi-redlining.'' The company claims that this featureallows a work group to interactively contribute different parts of a documentand simultaneously keep track of who is making which edits when.andM;This control may be implemented at the server level or at the individualworkstation, depending on the decision of the system administrator.andM;Version control is also a critical component of a groupware environment wheremany editors make continual changes to multiple versions of a document.andM;Stromberg-Carlson Corp., a manufacturer of telecom equipment in Lake Mary,Fla., uses both Samna IV+ word processing from Samna Corp. in Atlanta and thePVCS version-control system from Polytron Corp., of Beaverton, Ore., duringproduction of documentation for its telecom equipment.andM;The combination has worked quite well, according to Bob Segal, aStromberg-Carlson systems engineer.andP;  ''We use Samna for all our documentcreation and PVCS to keep track of all of the changes made to each version ofthe documentation.''andM;According to Amy Wohl, president of Wohl Associates Inc., a market-researchfirm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., true groupware word processing is not a reality,and probably won't be until 1991.andM;''Most of the coordination of groupware activities is dependent on thefunctionality of network hardware and software,'' said Wohl.andP;  ''Thisfunctionality is still basically missing.''andM;Wohl added that the LAN-based word processors available now represent anolder generation of technology and are a compromise between stand-alone wordprocessors and true groupware.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
