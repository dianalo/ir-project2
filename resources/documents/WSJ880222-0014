Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPAN </CO><IN> MON PCS CMD FRX </IN><TEXT>   The dollar has stabilized lately at higher levels after its explosive January rally, but economists and foreign-exchange traders still see the U.S. currency hitting new lows this year.    Political and economic worries and actions by central banks of the major industrial nations will block any further significant gains for the dollar and eventually pressure the U.S. currency lower, economists and traders say.    &quot;I'll stick to my forecast that we'll see lower levels&quot; in 1988, says Jim O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank, New York. &quot;By the end of the year, I think we'll see the dollar at 100 yen,&quot; he says.    If Mr. O'Neill is correct, the dollar is headed for a steep 23% slide from its level of 130.25 yen in late New York trading Friday. Many other forecasts call for a 16% decline from current levels to 110 yen. The dollar also is seen dropping 15% to 1.45 West German marks this year. The dollar stood at 1.7095 marks late Friday.    After nearly three years of decline, the dollar touched 40-year lows of 120.25 yen and 1.5630 marks Jan. 4, just before major central banks stepped in to reverse the trend. Their large, widely publicized dollar purchases in the foreign-exchange market in early January helped lift the dollar to its current levels, as did recent reports of a narrowing U.S. trade deficit.    But this may be it for the dollar's recovery, dollar bears say, and Friday they received what they consider an official endorsement of their views from a major central banker. In Zurich, Swiss National Bank President Pierre Languetin said the dollar will remain in a downward trend as long as imbalances among the major industrial powers continue. Speaking to reporters, he cited the U.S. budget deficit as a major destabilizing factor.    Mr. Languetin also indicated that major industrial nations will even block any further significant gains for the dollar. If the U.S. currency were to rise sharply again, he said, &quot;hopefully&quot; the major central banks would sell dollars in the market.    According to traders, two European central banks, the West German Bundesbank and Bank of England, sold modest amounts of dollars last week, as the U.S. currency buoyed to recent highs. In addition to stabilizing the dollar, traders believe the central banks aim to relieve a buildup of their dollar reserves and domestic money supply resulting from last month's intervention.    In doing so, traders say, the central banks will leave them no choice but to speculate on the dollar's decline by selling dollars themselves, pushing the currency lower.    But fundamental factors ultimately will drive the dollar lower, traders say. Concern about the U.S. presidential election heads the list of bearish factors. A Democratic victory is feared, because of the party's image for being protectionist and poor managers of the economy and budget. &quot;If you're an international investor in Zurich, Frankfurt or London, you'll be a little hesitant of putting your assets in dollars if any of the Democratic candidates look like they're going to win,&quot; says John J. McCarthy, vice president of foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co., New York. Foreign investors also are spooked by the &quot;fringe candidates&quot; of both parties, Mr. McCarthy says.    A sluggish economy and a possible recession are the other big weights on the dollar. The dollar is seen falling more sharply against the yen than major European currencies, because Japan's economy is seen growing between 5% and 6% this year, compared with flat growth in the U.S. and among other major industrial countries. &quot;Japan still performs like an economy on a different wavelength than the rest of the world,&quot; says Mr. O'Neill, the Marine Midland economist.    Lars J. Pedersen, chief international economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, adds that &quot;the recession risk is very central&quot; to investors' fears of the U.S.    The dollar is &quot;in a very precarious balance here,&quot; Mr. Pedersen says. &quot;It really boils down to whether we bring in these long-term capital inflows again. Are we at a point of this sea change? I don't think so.&quot;    ---   Friday's Activity   The dollar eased against most major currencies, in a continuation of the listless trading that distinguished last week.    The comments by Swiss National Bank's Mr. Languetin pressured the dollar to its intraday lows of 1.7050 West German marks and 130.02 yen, but it recovered a bit as dealers balanced positions ahead of the weekend.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7095 marks, down from 1.7120 Thursday. The dollar was unchanged against the Japanese currency at 130.25 yen. The British pound climbed to $1.7485 from $1.7420.    The dollar was stable in early trading Monday in Tokyo. At midmorning, the dollar was quoted at 129.98 yen.    The main impetus for the dollar's move down came from Mr. Languetin's saying that he hopes the major central banks would sell dollars, should the U.S. currency climb sharply in coming months, and that he believes the dollar will decline, given current relationships among the major industrial powers.    The comments &quot;scared people that there are further possible drops of the dollar in the offing,&quot; Thomas Benfer, a trader at Bank of Montreal, New York, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.20 an ounce to $445.10 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $445.25 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Friday, Feb. 19, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
