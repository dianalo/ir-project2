(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Preliminary studies in mice suggestthat an air pollutant may hasten the spread of cancer within thebody, a researcher said Tuesday.   Mice with cancer that breathed air containing nitrogen dioxide,which is found in smog, showed higher numbers of cancer-cellcolonies in their lungs than mice than breathed purified air, saidArnis Richters.   ``It is very difficult to say at this point, what does it meanfor human populations,'' said Richters, an associate professor ofpathology at the University of Southern California School ofMedicine in Los Angeles.   He spoke at a science writers seminar sponsored by the AmericanCancer Society.   In other presentations, researchers said doctors often overlooka warning sign for cancer in the mouth, and said a new treatmentstrategy appears promising for cancer of the esophagus.   About 11,500 new cases of cancer of the mouth are diagnosed eachyear; an estimated 10,600 new cases of cancer of the esophagus areexpected to be diagnosed this year, and 9,500 people will die fromit.   In the mouse study, animals breathed air with nitrogen dioxidelevels ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 parts per million. Such levels canbe reached in Los Angeles' notoriously dirty air, Richters said.   After breathing the air for six weeks to six months, the micewere injected with skin-cancer cells. Sixty days later, their lungswere examined to see if cancer had colonized there. The mice wereparticularly prone to get lung colonies from the skin cancer,Richters said.   Studies showed that breathing air with nitrogen dioxide damagedthe linings of tiny blood vessels in the lung, which may trapcirculating cancer cells and provide an environment for them togrow, he said.   The pollutant also reduced numbers of cells that form part ofthe disease-fighting immune system, he said.   He recommended that cancer specialists try to find places withfiltered air for their patients just before and after surgery, whenmore cancer cells may be released into the bloodstream.   Common cancers in humans that tend to spread to the lung, aprocess called metastasis, include those of the colon, breast andprostate.   Lance Liotta, chief of the National Cancer Institute's sectionof tumor invasion and metastasis, said the concept of Richters'paper ``makes sense.''   Previous work has shown that lung damage can increase theefficiency of metastasis to the lung, he said.   But he said it will be difficult to see whether air pollutionraises lung metastasis in humans because so many other factors areinvolved.   In another presentation, Dr. Arthur Mashberg of the VeteransAdministration Medical Center in East Orange, N.J., said dentistsand doctors often overlook an early sign of cancer of the mouth.   Doctors tend to look for white growths called leukoplakia as anearly sign of the cancer, but a red lesion that persists for 10 to14 days with no apparent ongoing irritation is actually moreominous, he said.   Only about 11 percent of leukoplakias are cancerous, but some 64percent of red lesions called mucosal erythroplasias are cancerous,he said.   The third presentation dealt with treating cancer of theesophagus.   Traditional treatment includes radiation or surgery. Dr.Lawrence Coia of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicinereported on a combined treatment of chemotherapy and radiation,without surgery.   Being able to avoid surgery is an advantage, because theoperation itself is dangerous and survival from the disease stillis low, commented Roy Sessions of Georgetown University.   Coia said half of patients whose disease had been confined tothe esophagus lived more than 18 months after the experimentaltreatment, with a corresponding figure of eight months for thosewith more advanced disease.   Under traditional treatment with either surgery or radiation,half of patients die within a year, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
