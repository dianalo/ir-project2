U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene also said Poindexter mustnarrow his other requests for material.   The ruling follows statements last week by independent counselLawrence Walsh that prosecutors would abandon substantial portionsof the indictment against Poindexter.   Poindexter is charged with four counts of obstructing and makingfalse statements to Congress in connection with Lt. Col. OliverNorth's activities on behalf of the Contras and a November 1985 armsshipment to Iran.   Walsh plans to retain portions of the indictment alleging thatPoindexter conspired with North and others in the obstructions andfalse statements. He said he would seek dismissal of theft and wirefraud charges against Poindexter pertaining to the diversion of Iranarms sale proceeds.   Poindexter should ``reformulate and limit his demands,'' Greenesaid in a four-page order signed Wednesday and made public Thursday.   The judge rejected a wide-ranging request for classifieddocuments that Poindexter filed June 12, four days before Walshannounced his intention to reduce the scope of the indictment.   An 64-page request for material filed May 15 demanded that thegovernment give Poindexter ``all documents created between Dec. 1,1981, and the present'' referring to U.S. support for the Contras.   Poindexter also demanded notebooks, diaries and other documentsrelating to former President Reagan, Vice President Bush, CIADirector William Casey and former Secretary of State George Shultz,as well as all material tending to establish that Reagan or Bushdirected the National Security Council staff to ensure that theContras would be supported during a congressional ban on militaryaid to the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
