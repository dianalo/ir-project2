The write-off will also be felt by Coca Cola Co., which retains a 49% stake in the entertainment giant it created in December by combining its own Entertainment Business Sector with its 37%-owned Tri-Star Pictures Inc. Coca-Cola said its first-quarter profit will be reduced by $51 million, which it will record as an equity loss. However, the Atlanta-based food and soft-drink giant said it still expects profits to increase by a percentage &quot;in the low teens&quot; both in the current first quarter and for the year. Analysts had predicted profit increases for both periods of between 13% and 15%.    New York-based Columbia plans to emphasize cash flow and a strong balance sheet, a strategy that &quot;will result in limited earnings, if any, over the next few years,&quot; company President Victor A. Kaufman said in an interview.    Columbia also said a new accounting rule that changes the way companies account for tax-vs.-book differences in asset values, will likely cause a one-time loss of $50 million to $60 million in the fiscal year beginning next Feb. 28. However, the company said the loss will be more than offset by strong syndication revenue expected from such television shows as &quot;Who's the Boss?&quot;    Columbia said its $105 million loss was for the period from Dec. 17 through Feb. 29, a one-time reporting anomaly that occurred because Columbia is changing from a calendar year to a Feb. 28 year end.    Mr. Kaufman described the movie write-downs as a one-time event that wiped the slate clean on &quot;all sides of the inventory&quot; and won't recur. Although the loss was caused mainly by write-downs of roughly 10 movies, it also included some operating expenses, Columbia said.    Analysts such as Harold Vogel, at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said the writedown and resulting loss aren't surprising.    &quot;Clearly the write-off is healthy,&quot; said Lisbeth R. Barron, an analyst with Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. &quot;It was probably closer to $200 million pretax, which is what we were hoping to see.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Columbia shares closed yesterday at $8.75, down 25 cents. Also in Big Board trading, Coca-Cola stock closed at $38.50, down 37.5 cents.    Mr. Kaufman stressed that Columbia is striving for cash flow and long-term growth, a strategy that is possible at least partly because of the nature of its ownership. Coke's 49% stake makes the movie, television and theater giant fairly impervious to takeovers and less prey to quarterly earnings pressures.    Coca-Cola said the loss on the Columbia Pictures stake will be partially offset by a $25 million pretax gain on the sale of a previously undisclosed stake in E-II Holdings Inc., which was acquired last month by American Brands Inc. Coca-Cola said it also expects its profit to be buoyed by strong performances by its domestic and international soft-drink businesses and by favorable foreign currency translations.    Coca-Cola disclosed its part of the news at an analysts' meeting in Atlanta, where several who attended said they were surprised by the company's disclosure that it holds an 8.5% stake in Beatrice Co., formerly BCI Holdings Inc., the company that was created to take Beatrice Cos. private in a leveraged buy-out in 1986. Coca-Cola secured the stake for less than $30 million in order to be sure it succeeded in buying back its own West Coast bottling company, since folded into Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the publicly held bottler in which Coca-Cola holds a 49% stake.    Coca-Cola also disclosed it had acquired for an undisclosed price the citrus food service business of H.P. Hood, a private Boston-based dairy and citrus concern. It said the acquisition would greatly increase the food service business of its foods division, maker of Minute Maid juices. Hood's food service business had sales last year of about $85 million. Its largest customer is McDonald's Corp.    Last year, Coca-Cola had first-quarter profit of $185.4 million, or 49 cents a share on revenue of $1.9 billion. In 1987, the company had net income of $916.1 million, or $2.43 a share, on revenue of $7.66 billion.    Coke had set up a $100 million reserve for costs associated with the Columbia merger with Tri-Star, such as layoffs and write-downs of TV programming. A Columbia spokeswoman said the latest writedowns are in addition to that earlier reserve and separate from it.    Columbia said that, after allowing for the brief inter-year period, its balance sheet will show roughly $3.5 billion in assets, $1 billion in net worth, $1 billion in debt outstanding, and more than $1.5 billion in unused credit, part of an overall credit facility of $2.5 billion.    Columbia also announced results for the Entertainment Business Sector for Jan. 1, 1987 through Dec. 17. It said net income was $51 million on revenue of $1.07 billion.    ---   Betsy Morris contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
