(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Sperry Corp. marketing executiveadmitted in court Friday that he initiated a bribery scheme inwhich a Navy official was paid $400,000 to help the company competefor a lucrative electronics contract.   Frank J. Lavelle, 68, who was marketing director at thecompany's Clearwater, Fla., facility, faces a possible 20-yearprison sentence for participating in the scheme that included otherofficials of Sperry, which became part of Unisys Corp. following a1986 merger with Burroughs Corp.   Lavelle entered his guilty plea in U.S. District Court on a daythat Dennis Mitchell, a former Unisys marketing executive, wassentenced to a 90-day term in a halfway house for arranging $4,000worth of illegal corporate campaign donations to severalcongressmen.   The guilty plea was the latest in a series of more than 20convictions of defense consultants, corporate executives andPentagon employees stemming from the Justice Department'sinvestigation of defense procurement fraud, nicknamed ``OperationIll Wind.''   Lavelle admitted that he introduced Garland L. Tomlin Jr., aformer Navy procurement official, to Sperry vice-president CharlesF. Gardner, saying that Tomlin wanted a ``nest egg'' for hiseventual retirement from the government.   Tomlin, 59, already has pleaded guilty to receiving $400,000from Sperry in 1983 and 1984 and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc., inexchange for bid information on a multimillion-dollar maintenancecontract on the electronic components of Navy weapons.   Sperry was eliminated from competition for the contract eventhough Tomlin wrote reports favoring the company's proposal andpromoted the bid with other Navy officials.   Gardner, 59, who was vice president in charge of Sperry'ssurveillance and fire control systems unit in Great Neck, N.Y., wassentenced Sept. 15 to 32 months in federal prison for his role in aseparate bribery scheme.   According to court papers, Gardner obtained permission from anunidentified Sperry official before approving the payments toTomlin, which were funneled by defense consultant James G. Neal toan offshore bank account Tomlin kept in the Bahamas.   Neal, 65, who has been described by prosecutors as ``the bankerfor Mr. Gardner and Mr. Gardner's operation'' has received a27-month prison term for his role in the bribery scheme.   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled Lavelle's sentencingfor Jan. 12, 1990.   The judge, meanwhile, ordered Mitchell to perform 100 hours ofcommunity service after serving a 90-day term in a halfway house.   Mitchell admitted arranging, at Gardner's behest, the payment of$4,000 in illegal corporate campaign contributions to various Housemembers who had influence over defense issues. They included Rep.Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the HouseAppropriations Committee.   There was no evidence that the lawmakers knew they werereceiving illegal contributions, which were made in the names ofdefense consultants hired by Unisys.   Mitchell, who could have received a 10-year prison term, toldHilton: ``I am sorry for my deeds and I am ready to face up to ithere.''   While acknowledging Mitchell's cooperation with the JusticeDepartment's continuing investigation, prosecutor Lee J. Radek saidhis crime was a ``very serious offense ... that goes to the heartof the electoral process.''</TEXT></DOC>
