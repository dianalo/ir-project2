(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man accused of killing a policeofficer surrendered Tuesday after holding a family hostage andtelling a television station he shot the officer in the headbecause he ``was calling me a worm.''   Police arrested Phillip Cole, 29, after Cole tossed out his gun,raised his hands and walked out of a rural Lester Prairie farmhousearound 5:15 a.m., said Hutchinson police Sgt. Scott Schwartz.   During the standoff, Cole spoke on the telephone with WCCO-TV inMinneapolis, telling the station that he shot police officerMichael Hogan.   ``He was calling me a worm. He was calling me a punk. He said hewas going to take me in. I shot him in the head,'' Cole told thestation.   ``It was the stupidest thing I did in my life because it'scosting me my life,'' Cole said.   Cole, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death lastFriday, was taken under heavy security to McLeod County Jail inGlencoe, Schwartz said.   Second-degree murder and theft charges also were filed Tuesdayagainst two women and a man arrested Friday in Hutchinson, a townof about 10,000 people 60 miles west of Minneapolis, in connectionwith Hogan's death.   The three others, whom authorities allege were part of ashoplifting ring with Cole, were each held in lieu of $125,000bail, McLeod County Attorney Michael Junge said.   Junge said murder charges were filed because ``they should haveand could have foreseen that, based on Mr. Cole's violent natureand the fact that he carried a weapon, their shoplifting couldeasily escalate to a shooting.''   He said more than $1,000 in merchandise was recovered from thevan the three were in when they were arrested.   Police would not say what charges were being considered.   Hogan, a 16-year police veteran, was shot to death in a privateroom at the J.C. Penney store in Hutchinson while he wasinterviewing Cole as part of a shoplifting investigation.   The funeral for the 43-year-old officer was held in Hutchinsonon Tuesday. About 600 people attended, at least half of them lawenforcement officials from around Minnesota.   After Hogan was shot, Cole allegedly escaped by commandeering acar to the Twin Cities, authorities said. On Sunday and Monday,police surrounded three different Minneapolis homes, believing Colewas hiding in each. But they failed to find him.   As police surrounded the third home late Monday night, Cole wasable to get away and take a car driven by a woman who also became ahostage, authorities said.   Officers began chasing Cole after an officer tried to pull hiscar over for a minor traffic violation in Minnetonka, said McLeodCounty Sheriff Duane Kopesky.   Cole's car rolled over and Cole, who has a long record ofviolence and imprisonment, ran from the accident to a farmhouse,forcing a woman to go with him, authorities said.   He then took Alan and Sandy Otto and their 2-year-old daughterhostage in their home, Kopesky said.   During the five-hour standoff, Kopesky said Cole's mother,Grace, and one of his sisters were brought to the scene to talk tohim by telephone. The strategy helped convince Cole to give up,Kopesky said.   Steve Geiger, a police psychologist who assisted in thenegotiations, said, ``There were extreme threats to the hostages inthe house and it was very clear that Cole wavered between homicidaland suicidal moments.''   WCCO-TV reported that during the standoff Cole said he wanted tosay goodbye to his mother and sister and commit suicide.   ``All I wanted was to talk to my family, you know, my familymembers. And say goodbye to my friends and I was gonna let thesepeople walk out the door and I was gonna take my own life,'' Coletold the station.   ``I just want to tell them that, `Hey, I love ya, ya know. AndI'm sorry that this had to happen. I'm sorry it came down tothis,'' he said.   The Ottos did not immediately return a telephone call Tuesday.   Cole also told WCCO-TV that a police officer helped him avoidcapture by warning him of searches, but police Sgt. Phil VanTasselsaid Cole's claim was ``ludicrous.''   ``I believe it's a little outlandish,'' said Minneapolis PoliceChief John Laux, ``but on the other hand, I am having my internalaffairs commander review the tape and we'll look into it. ... Ihaven't drawn any conclusions so early.''</TEXT></DOC>
