<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0111 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two types of x-ray computed tomography scanners (x-ray CT's) developedby the author for use in the engineering and archaeological areas arebriefly outlined. One is designed for non-destructive analysis of steelsamples, which was installed at the First Technical Laboratory of NipponSteel Corporation. This CT was designed based on a CT for medical usemarketed by Toshiba Corporation and consisted of a high voltage generator,x-ray measurement chamber, console and computer. Compared to medicalCT's, the equipment uses high voltage to permit analysis of steel samplesof up to 50 mm in diameter. The sample is rotated unlike ordinary medicalCT's in which the x-ray source and detector rotate. The use of sophisticatedcolimeters achieves a high plane resolution of 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm. Transmittedx-rays are measured in eight different directions and processed by thecomputer to give cross-sectional images on the CRT display on the console.The other CT presented here, which is currently being constructed atthe Fuchu Plant of Toshiba Corporation, is designed for analysis of historical(archaeological) samples. The CT is equipped with two radiation sources,one for x-ray and the other for gamma ray, to serve for different samples.Some measurements made with the CT for steel samples are presented.
