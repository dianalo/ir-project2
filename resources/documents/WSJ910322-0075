A Charter spokesman dismissed the proposal. &quot;We believebecause of antitrust difficulties and differences inoperating styles, {Community} knows it's highly likely thiswill never happen. We believe they are trying to destabilize{Charter} and its operations and get highly competitiveinformation.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   James W. Conte, Community Psychiatric's chairman and chiefexecutive officer, made the offer in a letter sent yesterdayto Charter directors. The letter, which was made public,states that Community is &quot;confident&quot; it can obtain allnecessary financing to complete the transaction.   The letter also states that the offer will expire April 1if the two companies haven't begun &quot;good-faith negotiations.&quot;   Taken private in 1988 in a leveraged buy-out, Charter hasbeen battered by insurers' efforts to reduce medical costs --particularly in mental health services, Charter's primarybusiness. Community Psychiatric, a smaller company, hasmanaged to post steady profit increases despite averagecompanywide occupancy rates of only slightly above 50%.   Throughout much of 1990, Charter insisted it could avoid arestructuring by cutting costs and selling assets. InJanuary, however, the company moved to restructure its $1.7billion debt, saying its cash-flow projections indicated it&quot;would not be able to meet all debt service payments&quot; in1991.   In an interview, Mr. Conte said he had met with Charter'schairman, William A. Fickling Jr., a few months ago at theairport of Charter's home city of Macon, Ga. Mr. Ficklingsaid that &quot;he would take the matter {of a businesscombination} under advisement,&quot; Mr. Conte said. He said therehasn't been any progress toward an agreement at subsequentmeetings between the companies' financial advisers.   A merger of the companies would create the U.S.'s largestpsychiatric hospital company, one that might ultimatelycontrol as much as 35% of the market, analysts said. Mr.Conte said such a company would be able to attractsubstantial business from big employers seekingguaranteed-price contracts and consistent mental health carefor employees.   The proposed combination also would be a good geographicfit that would bring &quot;considerable cost savings,&quot; Mr. Contesaid. Community Psychiatric, based in Laguna Hills, Calif.,owns and operates 50 hospitals in 18 states, mainly inCalifornia and other Western states. Charter owns 89psychiatric hospitals and 12 general hospitals in 29 states.Community Psychiatric said the companies have psychiatrichospitals in about a dozen of the same cities.   George Pillari, president of Health Care InvestmentAnalysts Inc. in Baltimore, applauded Community Psychiatric'soffer, saying it placed a &quot;very, very fair value&quot; on Charter.If the two companies were to combine, he predicted, Communitywould sell off Charter's general hospitals for a total of$170 million to $200 million and would try to sell the 12&quot;bottom performers&quot; in Charter's psychiatric business,leaving Community and Charter with about 125 facilities.   While a merger would give the two companies a significantportion of the psychiatric-hospital market, Mr. Pillari said,the large number of psychiatric beds in acute-care hospitalsmight dilute federal regulators' concerns about antitrustviolations.   Community Psychiatric has discussed its proposal withlenders who have indicated &quot;sufficient interest for us tothink we can raise the financing,&quot; Mr. Conte said. Hewouldn't identify the lenders. Community Psychiatric has alow debt-to-capital ratio of 6%, he said.   In its fiscal year ended Nov. 30, Community Psychiatrichad net income of $83.2 million, or $1.80 a share, on revenueof $381.8 million. Community Psychiatric has consistentlyposted annual profit increases of 15% or more over the past20 years, Mr. Conte said. Charter posted a loss of $311.3million on revenue of $1.28 billion in its year ended Sept.30.   &quot;Our current analysis shows that a combination withCharter based upon the prudent capital structure we aredesigning should not result in dilution in reported earningsper share, despite the issuance of our own common shares,&quot;Community Psychiatric said.   The letter to Charter's directors specifically asksCharter to halt any efforts to dispose of any of its assetsor subsidiaries and says any acquisition is contingent on &quot;anabsence of any bankruptcy filings.&quot; Other conditions includea complete review of Charter's current operating performanceand its prospects.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, CommunityPsychiatric shares fell 62.5 cents to $33.75. The company'sproposal was disclosed after the close of trading.</TEXT></DOC>
