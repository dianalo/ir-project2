In other words, in this bicentennial year everybody is celebrating the Constitution, but nobody is reading it.    That is why our work at the Committee for Literary Reconstitution is so important. Our plan is to enlist the country's pre-eminent authors literally to rewrite history, to turn the documents of freedom into the kind of stories people want to read.    Imagine the vast audience for a preamble to the Constitution written by a storyteller such as Garrison Keillor:    Philadelphia Days   &quot;We, the folks of the United States, in order to form a pretty good Union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity . . . but in those days, Philly was already more tranquil than Lake Wobegon.    &quot;On the lawn outside the State House, you could see sheep grazing in the summer silence, sheep as white and fluffy as the biscuits down at Mrs. Helga Johansen's Minuteman Cafe -- which reminds me of the time Jimmy Madison and Gouverneur Morris tried to borrow Mrs. Johansen's mule. . . .&quot;    Our marketing analysts project this version of the preamble would sell four million copies in hard-cover and produce a 26-week radio series.    To make this dream come true, we need your support -- and your contribution. Transforming the Constitution into a best seller takes money.    For the original articles, we need a real heavyweight such as John Updike, Elmore Leonard or Danielle Steele.    For the Bill of Rights, we need 10 top-flight authors, each specially suited to his or her amendment. We hope to contract Bob Woodward for freedom of the press; Alan M. Dershowitz for trial by jury; and for the right to bear arms, the king of the Second Amendment, Louis L'Amour:    Gunfight at the NRA Corral   &quot;Bump Hackett looked at the lawman, and his gun-metal gray eyes narrowed.    &quot;'You must be funnin' me, sheriff.'    &quot;'Sorry, son. I'm collecting the hardware. Hand over them shooting irons.'    &quot;'Hold on,' said Bump. 'I got my constitutional rights. Us Hacketts always bear arms. Even Grandpappy Hackett, who manned the cannons at Vicksburg, still drags his artillery around with him.'    &quot;'I interpret the framers' intentions around here, boy. Deputy, take his guns.'    &quot;Suddenly, the sound of hooves echoed through the purple canyon.    &quot;'Sheriff!' cried the deputy. 'It's Big Ed Meese and his gang of strict constructionists!'    &quot;'Take cover,' shouted the sheriff. 'A couple of you men head back to Harvard Law School for reinforcements. We're in for it this time. . . .'&quot;    If you pledge your support now, we will send you a handsome, boxed set of the reconstituted Constitution and its amendments as soon as they are issued. Your donation also entitles you to other proposed blockbusters of the Revolutionary era, such as &quot;No Paine, No Gain&quot; by the author of &quot;Common Sense,&quot; and the &quot;Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin&quot; by B. Franklin with Dave Anderson.    As a thank-you gift for your generosity, you will receive a new, leather-bound edition of the national anthem, specially commissioned from the master himself, Stephen King.    The Spangling   &quot;Oh!&quot;    &quot;Say, can you see?&quot;    &quot;By the . . . light!&quot;    &quot;What?&quot;    &quot;The twilight's . . . perilous! . . . We watched . . . streaming . . . RED . . . bursting . . . through the night . . . Still there! . . . OH!&quot;    If we can raise sufficient funds, the committee intends to turn over the redrafting of every American historical and political document to the popular and prolific Mr. King.    Some people may object to a Pledge of Allegiance that runs 1,200 pages. But Mr. King's millions of fans will savor every word; everyone else can just wait for the movie.    ---   Mr. Graybill is a writer living in the Washington, D.C., area. </TEXT></DOC>
