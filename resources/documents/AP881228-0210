The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, prior to the acquisition,placed all five institutions into receivership. The consolidationforms the state's largest savings and loan institution and itsfourth largest financial firm, said the board.   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will provide apackage worth $5.1 billion to assist the consolidation, said DavidColgren, a board spokesman. He said no taxpayer funds are involved.The money comes from the FSLIC insurance fund, created fromassessments on savings and loans.   George Barclay, president and principal supervising agent FederalHome Loan Bank of Dallas, described the deal as the largest suchbailout in the nation. Barclay said taxpayers won't directly beaffected by FSLIC's action.   The previous single largest transaction under the so-calledSouthwest Plan was the August consolidation of eight insolventthrifts, including Sunbelt Savings, into a new Sunbelt Savings. Thatdeal included a $2.5 billion cash infusion by FSLIC.   The 2-year-old Southwest Plan was devised by federal thriftregulators as a way to deal with the savings-and-loan crisis,centered in Texas with its energy and real estate slump.   Also today, the bank board said it had completed an agreement foranother takeover _ the sale of American Savings and Loan Associationof Stockton, Calif., to an investment group headed by Texasbillionaire Robert M. Bass. That deal totals as much as $1.7 billionin FSLIC funds.   Investors in the $5.1 billion takeover are banker Gerald J. Ford,chairman of Ford Bank Group in Dallas, along with MacAndrews andForbes Holdings Inc. of New York, a private investment group whosechairman is Ronald O. Perelman, according to a board statement.   The savings and loans being acquired are First Texas SavingsAssociation and Montfort Federal Savings and Loan Association, bothin Dallas; Gibraltar Savings Association and Home Savings and LoanAssociation, both in Houston; and Killeen Savings and LoanAssociation, in Killeen.   The former offices of the five thrifts opened today as branchesof First Texas Bank F.S.B., and the consolidation should cause nointerruption to depositors, the agency said.   Bank board officials said Gibraltar, with assets of $6.1 billion,and First Texas, with $3.5 billion in assets, are among the state'slargest Sandamp;Ls. The five thrifts have combined assets of $12.2 billion.   ``As far as the day-to-day operations, I want to assure you nochanges will take place except for the name on the door,'' Ford saidat a news conference. ``Overnight, we (First Texas) are healthy andstrong and everyone will benefit from this fresh start,'' he said.   M. Danny Wall, bank board chairman, said the $315 million in thedeal announced today is the largest capital infusion by anypurchaser under the Southwest Plan.   ``The plan has attracted more than $800 million in new capital toTexas thrifts this year and that level is quickly approaching thebillion-dollar mark,'' Wall said.   ``This demonstrates that there is a viable interest in Texasthrifts, and investors are confident enough in the future of thethrift industry that they are willing to invest hundreds of millionsof dollars in Texas thrifts.''   Seventy insolvent Texas thrifts have been merged into 12 underthe Southwest Plan to date.   The transaction was one of several in a last-minute spree ofSouthwest Plan deals expected for this week. Regulators andpurchasers are racing to finish by midnight Saturday, when taxbenefits that lower the costs of the purchases expire.   ``Federal regulators are continuing to meet with potentialacquirers,'' said Colgren. ``The chairman had said he hoped that wecould resolve somewhere between 15 and 35 thrifts (in Texas) byyearend, and we are at 20.   ``Clearly, we continue to meet with acquirers in constructing thebest transactions that balance the needs of the FSLIC and privateindustry.''</TEXT></DOC>
