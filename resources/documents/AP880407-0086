Scores of people were reported killedand wounded.   The deadly duel erupted at dawn after Iran said squadrons of itswarplanes bombed Baghdad twice in the first air raids on the Iraqicapital in more than two years.   The official Iraqi News Agency said only one Iranian jet gotthrough to Baghdad and was shot down by an Iraqi interceptor insideIran after being driven away from the capital by heavyanti-aircraft fire.   But Iraq then loosed six long-range missiles against Tehran andthe cities of Karaj, the holy city of Qom, Isfahan and Tabriz, theagency reported. Iran also reported bombing the northern Iraqi cityof Erbril and the southern ports of Basra and Umm Qasr.   The sudden escalation overshadowed talks to resume in New Yorkbetween United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarand Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Larijani, on effortsto arrange a cease-fire in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war.   ``Iran is determined more than ever to punish this criminalregime in Iraq for its aggression,'' Larijani said after a meetingWednesday, indicating little change in Tehran's refusal to acceptthe U.N. Security Council's July 20 cease-fire resolution.   Today's sharp upsurge in hostilities came on the eve ofparliamentary elections in Iran. Officials fear the Iraqis willlaunch a missile blitz when voters go to the polls Friday.   Both sides reported scores of civilians killed or wounded intoday's missile attacks on Tehran and Baghdad and other cities aswell as air raids and artillery bombardments.   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,said Iranian jets penetrated ``sophisticated radar andanti-aircraft defenses'' ringing the Iraqi capital to ``heavilybomb selected targets.''   It said the first raid at 6:05 a.m. scored ``accurate hits.''   Another formation of fighter-bombers streaked above the city of5 million people 10 minutes later, IRNA reported.   IRNA said all the jets returned safely to their bases, but didnot say how many were involved in the attacks or give any detailsof their targets.   Although Iraq said only that one Iranian jet got through toBaghdad and was shot down, the ferocity and scale of the Iraqibombardment indicated that the Iranian claim was probably true.   It was one of the most widespread missile barrages the Iraqishave unleashed since the latest bout of the ``war of the cities''exploded Feb. 29.   Iran said Iraqi warplanes also bombed Tabriz and other cities inwestern Iran. In retaliation, the Iranians said they fired twomissiles into Baghdad and battered ports of Basra and Umm Qasr, anIraqi naval base, with 13 short-range missiles.   Basra and other Iraqi border cities were hammered with artilleryfire, IRNA reported.   IRNA said that other formations of Iranian warplanes attackedIraqi troop concentrations in Al-Amara, north of Basra, and otherareas in the southern front, ``inflicting heavy losses.''   The Iranians have had some 250,000 men massed east of Basra forweeks. But despite repeated air raids on Iraqi defenses, they havemade no move to launch a long-awaited offensive against the city.   INA said two Iranian warplanes also bombed the northeastern cityof Erbil, killing several civilians.   IRNA said Iranian fighter-bombers also attacked a headquartersof the National Liberation Army, an Iraqi-based dissident movementseeking to topple the Tehran regime, in the northern Diyala region,``destroying all their targets.''   Iran's air force has been badly depleted by combat losses and achronic shortage of spare parts.   Outnumbered by around 8-to-1 by Iraq's powerful air force, ithas not raided Baghdad since early 1986. But in recent months ithas become increasingly aggressive.   IRNA said the Iranian air raids ``completely caught the enemy bysurprise.''   It said the warplanes destroyed Iraqi military basses inBaghdad, ``killing or wounding dozens of soldiers.''   IRNA quoted Iran's air force commander, Brig. Gen. MansourSattari, as saying the bombing raids were ``unique and veryvaluable militarily.'' He did not elaborate.   Half of Tehran's 6 million people have fled the capital sinceFeb. 29. Both sides have fired nearly 300 missiles into eachother's cities, killing hundreds on both sides.</TEXT></DOC>
