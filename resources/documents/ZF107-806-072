(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Microsoft Works 2.0 Adds Windows-like Functionality While the debates aboutMicrosoft Windows and the Presentation Manager raged, another Microsoftsoftware package quietly established itself as the standard in low-endintegrated software.andP;  Graphical environments may be the future of trulyeasy-to-use PCs, but Microsoft Works is here now.andM;In one easily mastered packaged, Microsoft has combined the four most basicsoftware tools: a word processor, a spreadsheet, a database, and acommunications module.andP;  Version 2.0 ($149) builds on its predecessor'sintelligent design and close integration of components.andM;Perhaps the most intriguing addition to Works is the ability to open up toeight simultaneous windows.andP;  You can start a report in the word processor,for insance, and then open a spreadsheet.andP;  The spreadsheet appears in awindow that you can move or size in much the same way that Windows allows.andO;Windows can overlap or completely obscure each other.andM;The windowing feature gives Works a modest form of context switching, whichis Windows' biggest selling point.andP;  It's not multitasking, and it is limitedto the built-in Works tools, but there is great value in the ability to movequickly from one application to another without having to close files.andP;  Toswitch from the current window to one that is partially obscurred, you simplyclick on the desired window.andP;  It moves to the foreground and becomes active.andM;You use a pull-down menu to control the movement and sizing of windows; youcan handle most of these functions with a mouse, as well.andP;  The Arrange Allmenu choice tiles your open windows so that all are visible and they don'toverlap.andM;The Arrange All feature can make for a busy screen if you have lots of openfiles, but it's useful for getting a &quot;global&quot; view of your work.andP;  It alsocomes in handy when you lose a window behind several others and don't want torearrange the whole screen to find it.andM;Another useful enhancement comes directly from Word, Microsoft's high-endword processor.andP;  Like Word, Works can be started either in straight charactermode or in &quot;character graphics&quot; mode, which allows on-screen representationof attributes like boldface and italics.andP;  The pure character mode maximizesperformance on older, slower machines, while the graphical enhancements giveusers access to WYSIWYG amenities not usually found in integrated packages.andM;All of these improvements seem to move Works toward the graphical futurepresaged by Windows and realized (one hopes) by the Presentation Manager.andO;Other enhancements in Works, Version 2.0, are clearly designed to solidifythe package's role as a self-contained environment.andP;  Works--or any otherintegrated package--is too confining for advanced PC users.andP;  But Works seeksto provide an all-encompassing solution for the lower-level user.andM;Toward that end, Version 2.0 allows you to launch DOS applications fromwithin Works.andP;  That can mean simply shelling out to the DOS prompt, or it caninvolve running an external application.andP;  The typical Works user would havelittle need for external applications, but this feature provides theopportunity for some flexibility.andM;I easily configured Works to launch XyWrite, my preferred word processor, andProcomm, the communications package I use.andP;  With XyWrite called throughWorks, I was able to load four 19K text files and still have some memory leftover.andM;Basic DOS services are now supported from within Works, as well; you can copyand format disks, for instance, without leaving the familiar pull-down menuenvironment.andM;Microsoft stumbles a bit when it comes to file conversion.andP;  With the wideassortment of word processors currently used in offices, this is anabsolutely essential, and increasingly common, feature.andP;  PFS:ProfessionalWrite, from Software Publishing Corp., sets the standard at the low end withits truly transparent conversion of a variety of file formats.andM;As shipped, Works 2.0 doesn't offer built-in conversion to and from majorword processor formats other than Word.andP;  The documentation includes an orderform for the conversion utility--not much help if you need to convert a fileon the spot.andM;Works 2.0 provides some of the functionality associated with SideKick andother desktop managers.andP;  You can pop up a calculator from within the Worksapplications, and an alarm clock displays a brief on-screen message at auser-specified time.andM;The enhancements in Version 2.0 also include support for extended memory, a30,000-word thesaurus, and a limited style-sheet convention for each basictool.andM;Good integrated software saves many users from the prolonged pain of learningseparate applications.andP;  Microsoft Works lives up to this standard but alsogoes beyond it in offering truly useful and powerful tools.andP;  Only its lack ofgood file format conversion deserves serious criticism.andP;  At $149, Works is anoutstanding value.andP;  That one outlay covers just about all the functionalitythat many users will need.andP;  One rarely sees that kind of value in software.andM;Ironically, in bringing Windows-like functionality down to this level,Microsoft may be poaching in its own potential market.andP;  but some MicrosoftWorks users might eventually make the transition up to Windows anyway.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
