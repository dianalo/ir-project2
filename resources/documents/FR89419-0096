Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from March 25, 1989 through April 7, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on April 5, 1989 (54 FR 13756). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By May 19, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arkansas Power andamp; Light Company, Docket No. 50-368, Arkansas NuclearOne, Unit 2 (ANO-2), Pope County, Arkansas </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>December 12, 1986 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>This amendment would changethe ANO-2 Technical Specifications (TS) which describe the design featuresof the Spent Fuel Storage Pool. These changes will update the TS to conformwith Amendment 43 (April 15, 1983) which increased the spent fuel storagecapacity for ANO-2. This amendment also would make a number of editorial,clarifying and administrative corrections to the Technical Specifications.Remaining issues in the amendment request have been addressed in previousnotices. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards for determining whether a significant hazards considerationexists by providing certain examples (51 FR 7751). One of the examples(i) of actions not likely to involve a significant hazards relates to apurely administrative change to technical specifications; for example,a change to achieve consistency throughout technical specifications, correctionof an error, or a change in nomenclature. This amendment would correct an administrative error in omission of spentfuel pool design feature information in the ANO-2 Technical Specifications.The new information should have been included in the February 17, 1983request for TS change to reflect expansion of the spent fuel pool capacityfor the plant. That requested change was approved in Amendment 43 whichexpanded storage from 485 spaces to 988 spaces. In addition the requestedset of editorial changes are administrative in nature. The current changeswould correct these administrative oversights, and therefore appear tobe similar to example (i). Since the application for amendment involves proposed changes that aresimilar to an example of an action that is considered not to involve significanthazards considerations, the Commission has made a proposed determinationthat the application for amendment involves no significant hazards considerations.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Tomlinson Library, ArkansasTech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Nicholas S.

Calvo <ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company et al., Docket No. 50-325 and 50-324,Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units No. 1 and 2, Brunswick County, NorthCarolina </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendment: </T3>September 4, 1987, as supplementedApril 5, 1988, superseded February 20, 1989, and supplemented March 20,1989. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>Based on the guidance providedin NRC Generic Letter 88-16, the proposed change removes the values ofcycle-specific parameter limits from the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant(BSEP) Technical Specifications (TS) and includes them in the Core OperatingLimits Report (COLR). However, the COLR will be referenced in the TS, andwill be periodically submitted to the Commission. In addition, and based on the guidance in the NRC Safety Evaluation Report(SER) for Amendment 19 to General Electric Licensing Topical Report NEDE-24011-P-A,the proposed change eliminates BSEP Technical Specification 3/4.2.4, LinearHeat Generation Rate (LHGR), and the associated Total Peaking Factor (TPF).The use of TPF in the formulation of the Average Power Range Monitor (APRM)flow-biased scram and rod block setpoint setdown requirements of Specification3/4.2.2 is being revised, along with associated definitions that are added,deleted, or revised. The associated revision of Technical Specification3/4.2.1 specifies that only the most limiting lattice Average Planar LinearHeat Generation Rate (APLHGR) limit for multiple lattice fuel types willbe specified. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L) has reviewed the proposedchanges to TS and has determined that the requested amendment does notinvolve a significant hazards consideration as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">Removal of Cycle-Specific Parameter Limits: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Theabnormal operational transients analyzed in the BSEP Updated Final SafetyAnalysis Report will remain bounded. There will be no change in the operationof the facility as a result of the amendment. No safety-related equipmentor function will be altered. The proposed amendment merely removes cycle-specificparameter limits from the Technical Specifications and references theirinclusion in the CORE OPERATING LIMITS REPORT. NRC approved analyticalmethodology will continue to be used as the basis for the results thatwill now be reported in the CORE OPERATING LIMITS REPORT. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Asstated above, no safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operationswill be altered as a result of this amendment. The requested change doesnot create any new accident mode. The proposed amendment is in accordancewith the guidance provided in Generic Letter 88-16 for licensees requestingremoval of the values of cycle-specific parameters from Technical Specifications.The establishment of these limits in accordance with an NRC-approved methodologyand the incorporation of these limits into the CORE OPERATING LIMITS REPORTwill ensure that proper steps have been taken to establish the values ofthese limits. Furthermore, the submittal of the CORE OPERATING LIMITS REPORTto the Commission will allow the Staff to continue to trend the valuesof these limits without the need for prior Staff approval of these limitsand without introduction of an unreviewed safety question. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment does not alter the requirement that theplant be operated within the limits for cycle-specific parameters nor therequired remedial actions that must be taken if these limits are not met.While it is recognized that such limits are essential to plant safety,the values of such limits can be determined in accordance with NRC-approvedmethods without affecting nuclear safety. The removal of the values ofthese limits from the BSEP Technical Specifications is coincident withtheir incorporation into the CORE OPERATING LIMITS REPORT that is submittedto the Commission. Hence, appropriate measures exist to control the valuesof these limits. Therefore, the proposed changes are administrative innature and do not impact the operation of the facility in a manner thatinvolves a reduction in the margin of safety. Indeed, as stated in GenericLetter 88-16, the proposed amendment is responsive to industry and NRCefforts on improvements in Technical Specifications, and will result ina resource savings for the licensee and the NRC by eliminating the majorityof license amendment requests for changes in values of cycle-specific parametersin Technical Specifications. Indirectly, this is a safety improvement becausethe released resources may now be utilized on more consequential tasks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Deletion of LHGR: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The NRC SafetyEvaluation Report for Amendment 19 to GESTAR-II concluded that a changesimilar to the proposed change ``...will, in practice, result in the sameoperating power distribution limits and safety margins as the current TechnicalSpecifications.'' The essential redundancy of the Linear Heat GenerationRate and the Average Planar Linear Heat Generation Rate, and the equivalenceof the formulation of the APRM flow-biased setpoint setdown requirement,has been established and is documented in the NRC Safety Evaluation Reportfor Amendment 19 of GESTAR-II. Since the same operating power distributionlimits as current Technical Specifications will, in practice, be required,the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the consequencesof any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change eliminates a thermal performance limit, modifiesseveral definitions and provides an equivalent basis for adjusting APRMflow-biased setpoint setdown based on power distribution parameters. Assuch the change only affects power distribution parameters which do notinfluence the probability of any accident. Therefore, the proposed changedoes not result in a significant increase in the probability of any accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed change does not alter the function of any componentor system and, therefore, does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The margin of safety, as established by current Technical Specificationpower distribution limits, are [SIC] based on the assumptions and analysesdocumented in the BSEP Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. The proposedamendment will, in practice, result in the same power distribution limitsas contained in current Technical Specifications; therefore, the proposedchange does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the CPandamp;L determinations and is in basic agreementwith them. Cycle-specific parameter limits will be referenced in the TS,but will be located in a licensee controlled document instead of locatedin the TS. The linear heat generation rate limit is essentially redundantto the average planar linear heat generation rate limit and the latterlimit will be retained. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington,North Carolina 28403-3297. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>R. E. Jones, General Counsel, CarolinaPower andamp; Light Company, P. O.

Adensam <ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company, Docket No. 50-400, Shearon HarrisNuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina</ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>February 22, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldchange Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.1.1.3, ``Moderator TemperatureCoefficient,'' to allow a more negative moderator temperature coefficient(MTC) in the Limiting Condition for Operation, TS 3.1.1.3b, and in theassociated Surveillance Requirement, TS 4.1.1.3b. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityof consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided the followingno significant hazards consideration determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.Accident analyses do not explicitly input an MTC, but rather a constantmoderator density coefficient (MDC). Converting the MDC used in the accidentanalyses to an MTC is a straight forward calculation which accounts forthe rate of change of moderator density with temperature at the conditionsof interest; namely, Hot Full Power (HFP). For those non-LOCA transientswhere analysis results are made more severe by assuming maximum moderatorfeedback, a constant MDC of 0.43 delta K/gm/cc has been assumed to existthroughout the transient. Converting this to a limiting MTC at HFP conditionsgives about -56 pcm/anddegrees; F. The proposed Technical Specification LCOMTC value of -49 pcm/anddegrees; F conservatively assures that under otherallowed operating conditions (such as rods at insertion limits, off-nominaltemperature and pressure and xenon and axial offset variations) that theactual MTC will not exceed the analysis value. Hence, there is no effecton any design basis accident and no increases in the consequences of anydesign basis accident associated with this Technical Specification change.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For LOCA analyses (large and small break), the only significance ofa change in MTC would be to the extent that it may affect generated decayheat. The reactivity assumptions in the large break and small break LOCAaccident analyses assume a maximum decay heat generation according to therequirements of Appendix K. Consequently, any changes to the MTC wouldshow no effect for the large and small break LOCA analyses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As stated above, the safety analysis assumption remains conservativewith respect to the proposed LCO limit value of -49 pcm/anddegrees; F. Therefore,the proposed change in the LCO limit from -42 pcm/anddegrees; F to -49 pcm/anddegrees;F still assures that the accident analyses moderator temperature coefficientis not exceeded. The proposed changes do not impact the consequences ofany design basis accident. Also, there are no failure modes associatedwith the proposed changes; therefore, there is no increase in the probabilityor consequences of any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident. There is no change in the plant design orin operating procedures. Additionally, there are no new failure modes introducedby the proposed changes; therefore, there can be no impact on plant responseto the point where a different accident is created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The proposed changes have no impact on the consequencesof an accident or on any of the protective boundaries. The bases to theMTC Technical Specification 3/4.1.1.3 states ``The limitations on moderatortemperature coefficient (MTC) are provided to ensure that the value ofthis coefficient remains within the limiting condition assumed in the FSARaccident and transient analyses.'' The proposed changes continue to satisfythis statement. The definition of the most limiting condition assumed inthe safety analyses is changing from an extremely conservative and unrealisticassumption of Hot Full Power (HFP), all rods in (ARI), to a Most NegativeFeasible MTC approach. The Most Negative Feasible MTC still provides aconservative estimate of the worst MTC, and the revised limits still provideassurance that the values used in the safety analyses remain bounding comparedto those which may be experienced under real accident conditions. Basedon the above discussion, there is no significant reduction in the marginof safety. </ITAG>Based on the above, the licensee has concluded that the proposed amendmentmeets the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significanthazards consideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendmentdoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Cameron Village RegionalLibrary 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh, North Carolina 27605. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>R.

Currently, Surveillance Requirement 4.9.8.2 requires that at leastone RHR loop be verified in operation and circulating reactor coolant ata flow rate of greater than or equal to 2500 gpm at least once per 12 hourswhen the reactor is in Mode 6 with irradiated fuel in the vessel and thewater level above the top of the reactor vessel flange is less than 23feet. The 2500 gpm flow requirement would be maintained when the waterlevel is at or above the reactor vessel flange. The associated Bases sectionwould also be revised to reflect this change. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityof consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided the followingno significant hazards consideration determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The existing requirement of Specification 3/4.9.8.2 that at leastone RHR loop be in operation ensures that: (1) sufficient cooling capacityis available to remove decay heat and maintain the water in the reactorvessel below 140anddegrees; F as required in Mode 6, and (2) sufficient coolantcirculation is maintained through the core to minimize the effect of aboron dilution incident and prevent boron stratification. The Mode 6 minimumflow limit of 2500 gpm was established to alleviate the potential for boronstratification under refueling conditions. However, achieving 2500 gpmflow rate at the reduced water levels of mid-loop operation could causecavitation and eventual damage of the RHR pumps. Boron stratification isonly a concern with the large volumes of water present when the refuelingcavity is filled. Sufficient mixing exists, even at low RHR flow rates,to preclude boron stratification when the water level is below the reactorvessel flange. Administrative controls to isolate potential sources ofnon-borated water from the reactor, established in Technical Specification3/4.9.1, prevent a boron dilution event while in Mode 6. Since boron stratificationis not a concern at reduced RCS water inventories and the possibility fora boron dilution event is precluded by Technical Specification 3/4.9.1,the proposed revision to eliminate the minimum flow limit when the RCSwater level is below the reactor vessel flange does not significantly increasethe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Theproposed amendment splits the existing surveillance requirement into twoseparate surveillances. The first, Surveillance Requirement 4.9.8.2.1,is applicable when the RCS water level is at or above the reactor vesselflange and maintains the 2500 gpm minimum flow limit. The second, SurveillanceRequirement 4.9.8.2.2, is applicable when the RCS water level is belowthe reactor vessel flange and requires that one RHR loop be verified inoperation and circulating reactor coolant at least once per 12 hours. Thisnew surveillance requirement is identical to the existing Mode 5 SurveillanceRequirement 4.4.1.4.2, the only difference being the plant mode. That is,prior to de-tensioning the reactor vessel head closure bolts with watertemperature less than 140anddegrees; F the plant is in Mode 5. Upon detensioningof the bolts, the plant is in Mode 6. There is no change in reactor vesselwater level, however, at this point the existing Surveillance Requirement4.9.8.2 establishes a minimum flow rate of 2500 gpm. This minimum flowrequirement is not necessary when the water level is below the reactorvessel flange as demonstrated in the Bases for Specification 3/4.4.1, ReactorCoolant Loops and Coolant Circulation, which states that, in Mode 5, ``.. . the operation of one reactor coolant pump or one RHR pump providesadequate flow to ensure mixing and prevent stratification.'' No Mode 5minimum flow rate is established in Specification 3/4.4.1. Therefore, aslong as the RCS water level is below the reactor vessel flange a minimumflow requirement is not necessary either in Mode 5 or Mode 6. Upon raisingthe water level above the reactor vessel flange, the proposed SurveillanceRequirement 4.9.8.2.1 will be in effect and require a minimum flow rateof 2500 gpm. As such, the proposed amendment will not result in the plantbeing placed in a condition not currently allowed during Mode 5 operationand, therefore, does not create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Eliminating the minimum RHR flow limit of 2500 gpm when the RCSwater level is below the reactor vessel flange does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. As stated above, the Mode 6 minimumflow limit of 2500 gpm was established to alleviate the potential for boronstratification under refueling conditions. Boron stratification is onlya concern with the large volumes of water present when the refueling cavityis filled. Sufficient mixing exists, even at low RHR flow rates, to precludeboron stratification when the water level is below the reactor vessel flange.In addition, the proposed amendment does not result in the plant beingplaced in a condition not currently allowed by the existing Mode 5 SurveillanceRequirement 4.4.1.4.2. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not resultin a significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>Based on the above, the licensee has concluded that the proposed amendmentmeets the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significanthazards consideration.

According to 10 CFR50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe proposed amendment would not: 1. Involves a significant increase in probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes requested have been evaluated as presented below:(1) The automatic actuation of the shut trip coil attachment provides analternate method to open the reactor trip coil breakers. When a reactortrip signal is generated, there are diverse mechanisms to provide a reactorbreaker trip which would minimize the possibility of an Anticipated TransientWithout Scram (ATWS) occurring. The proposed changes revise the surveillancesto require independent testing of the undervoltage and shunt trip coilattachment for the manual reactor trip and the reactor trip breakers. These surveillances provide assurance of reactor trip breaker operabilitywhen required. Since there are now two diverse trip mechanisms, a changeis also proposed to allow forty-eight (48) hours to restore one of thetrip features when it becomes inoperable, before a reactor shutdown isrequired. This is conservative because it recognizes that there are twotrip mechanisms instead of one and allows forty-eight (48) hours to restorethe inoperable trip feature. This change is based on the allowable timereferenced in the NRC Generic Letter 85-09. Removal of note 14, for theBraidwood Technical Specifications is administrative in nature. (2) The proposed changes do not change the manner in which the reactorprotection system provides plant protection. The addition of surveillancetest requirements provides assurance that the Reactor functions will occurwhen required. Present plant equipment is not being altered to accommodatethese changes, hence, no new failure mechanisms are introduced. (3) The proposed changes are expected to increase the overall margin ofsafety because they provide periodic test requirements for the ReactorTrip Breakers. These proposed surveillance changes are designed to provideassurance of operability of the reactor trip and bypass breakers.

The MAPLHGR limit curves of Technical Specification 3.2.1 for both Units1 and 2 are being redrawn to reflect higher nodal exposure values for fueltypes 8CRB176, 8CRB219, and BP8CRB299L. The purpose of the revision isthat the full analyzed range of nodal exposures was not previously reflectedand operation during Cycle 3 of each unit is expected to go beyond thelimits of the existing curves. The MAPLHGR limits of Technical Specification Figures 3.2.1-1 and 3.2.1-2depict the maximum allowable Average Planar Linear Heat Generation Ratefor the specific fuel types as a function of nodal exposure. The exposuredependent limits are analyzed by GE and approved by the NRC through reviewsof General Electric Standard Application for Reloads (GESTAR). The siteTechnical Specifications then provide a controlling document to reflectthese analyzed limits. During the Cycle 2 reload licensing submittals for both LaSalle units (Amendment40 for Unit 1 - NPF-11, Amendment 32 for Unit 2 - NPF-18), the MAPLHGRlimit curves for fuel type 8CRB299L were drawn to the same exposures (30,000MWD/STU) as the initial cycle fuel curves for simplification. The GE analyzedexposure range of up to 44,500 MWD/STU (49.0 GWD/MTU) was reviewed andapproved in those submittals (GE ``Supplemental Reload Licensing Submittal''documents 23A1843 and 23A4735 for Units 1 and 2, respectively). Redrawingof these curves is an administrative change only, and will adequately reflectthe analyzed exposure range of the 8CRB299L bundles throughout their useablebundle lifetime. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether no significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).

Specifically, the proposed amendment would add Section 3.25, AlternateShutdown System, which would require the operability of the Alternate ShutdownSystem whenever the reactor coolant temperature reaches or exceeds 325anddegrees;F. This section specifically identifies the minimum equipment to be operable,their locations, and action to be taken in the event of inoperability ofany specified equipment. The proposed amendment would also add Section 4.20 which would requireperformance of periodic surveillance testing of certain Alternate ShutdownSystem equipment. This section specifically identifies the Alternate ShutdownSystem components subject to the surveillance requirements. The amendment request also proposed other changes not described above.Those proposed changes will be discussed in a separate notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>when the Commission considers issuance of thosechanges. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.59, this means the operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The Commission has evaluated the proposed changesagainst the above criteria as follows: A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences or an accident previously evaluated because the AlternateShutdown System design provides a means to control auxiliary feedwaterin the event of a fire in the control room which results in loss of controlfrom the main control room of the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pump.A third auxiliary feedwater pump provides a separate injection path tothe steam generators in the event of a fire at the Alternate Hot Shutdownpanel which results in loss of control of the normal auxiliary feedwaterpumps. Therefore, since a postulated fire cannot disable the auxiliaryfeedwater function, the change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.B. For the same reasons as cited in paragraph A above, the change doesnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. C. The change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safetybecause the Alternate Shutdown System provides assurances of the auxiliaryfeedwater function in the event of a fire that disables normal controlof this function.

In addition, afootnote would be added to the applicability for TS 3.3.4 to state thatthe Turbine Overspeed Protection System need not be operable, ``... inMODE 2 or 3 with all main steam line isolation valves and associated bypassvalves in the closed position and all other steam flow paths to the turbineisolated.'' <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>By letter dated November 7, 1988, Northeast Nuclear Energy Company(the licensee) submitted the Millstone Unit 3 Turbine Overspeed ProtectionMaintenance and Test Program (TOPMTP). The TOPMTP encompasses the surveillancerequirements of Section 4.3.4.2. In addition, the TOPMPT provides for otherturbine overspeed system related tests and for high and low pressure turbinerotor inspections, thereby assuring an acceptably low probability of arotor burst at or near design overspeed. Avoiding destructive overspeedand rotor failures is essential to minimizing the probability of the generationof turbine missiles which could impact and damage safety-related components,structures, and equipment. The more comprehensive TOPMPT provides the necessaryassurance that the probability of turbine generated missiles will remainat or below the criteria of 1 x 10-5 per year in accordance with StandardReview Plan, Section 3.5.1.3, ``Turbine Missiles.'' The proposed changeto TS 6.5.1.6(f) would provide for administrative and technical oversight,by the licensee, for the TOPMPT. With regard to the proposed footnote to TS 3.3.4, the provision would allowthe inoperability of the Turbine Overspeed Protection System, during operationalModes 2 and 3 (hot standby and low power generation) only under specifiedconditions which prevent the turbine, itself, from operating. Title 10 CFR Part 50, Section 50.92 contains standards for determiningwhether a proposed license amendment involves significant hazards considerations.In this regard, the proposed changes to the TS does not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously analyzed. The TOPMPT encompasses all of the surveillancerequirements of Section 4.3.4.2 and also provides for additional turbineoverspeed protection system related tests and high and low pressure turbinerotor inspections. Since the intent of this change is to ensure the reliabilityof the overall Turbine Overspeed Protection System, (i.e., channel calibrationand testing of related components), there is no adverse impact on any designbasis accident. This program would also provide the necessary assurancethat the probability of turbine generated missiles will remain at or belowthe NRC criteria, eliminating the need for considering turbine missilesin design basis analysis. In addition, the proposed change to TS 6.5.1.6(f),requiring PORC oversight of the TOPMPT provides reasonable assurance thatchanges to the TOPMPT will not adversely affect the program. With regard to the proposed inoperability of the Turbine Overspeed ProtectionSystem during Modes 2 and 3, the probability of turbine failure would notincrease since the turbine cannot be operated under the proposed restrictions.2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously analyzed. Since there are no changes in the way the plant isoperated, the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created. No newfailure modes are introduced. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposedreplacement of the Section 3/4.3.4.2 turbine overspeed protection surveillancerequirements with a newly developed comprehensive maintenance and testingprogram does not introduce any adverse impacts. Since the proposed changesalso do not affect the consequences of any accident previously analyzed,there is no reduction in the margin of safety.

Butler <ITAG tagnum="84">Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, JamesA. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego, New York </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>October 13, 1987, as supplemented March31, 1989. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment woulddelete a Technical Specification (TS) surveillance test of the scram dischargesystem which requires that a manual scram of the reactor be performed froma control rod configuration of less than or equal to 50% rod density onceeach operating cycle. This test was intended to verify the operabilityof the scram discharge system. However, it is felt that other surveillancerequirements which are present in the TS which do not involve a scram,are already in effect which adequately demonstrate this operability. Additionally,the licensee has committed to performing an evaluation of the operationof the scram discharge volume prior to restart, should a scram occur. Thisproposed change, therefore, will reduce the number of unnecessary challengesto the reactor protection system and the resulting transient. Other proposedchanges are made to correct typographical errors which exist on the samepage. Specifically, the proposed change would delete Specification 4.3.A.2.gso that a scram at 50% control rod density would no longer be required.When any scram occurs, the scram discharge piping and the instrument volumevent and drain valves automatically shut to isolate the system from thereactor building environs. The piping and instrument volume then receivethe water discharged from the control rod drives as they force the controlrods into the core. A scram discharge system modification was installed some years ago to ensurethe adequacy of this system and a post-installation test was performedat that time which proved the adequacy of the design. Since no unexpectedchanges can be expected which affect this design, repeated tests of theadequacy of the system by manual scram are not necessary. Other TS requirements(namely, Specifications 4.3.A.2.b, 4.3.A.2.f, 4.3.C.3, Table 4.1-1, andTable 4.1-2) adequately ensure the continued operability of the scram dischargesystem. Therefore, no decrease in testing which is designed to ensure theavailability and operability of the scram discharge system results fromdeleting the 50% rod density scram test requirement. Also, the proposedchange is consistent with the testing requirements of most BWR plants andwith the Standard Technical Specifications. The proposed administrative changes would (1) relocate Specification 3.3.A.2.ewhich is located on page 89a to the right-hand column of the page so thatit becomes 4.3.A.2.e, (2) replace the colon in the second sentence of thenew Specification 4.3.A.2.e with a comma and add ``a'' after the comma,and (3) remove the period from the end of Specification 3.3.A.2.d, combineit with its continuation which is on page 90, and place the entire specificationonto page 89a. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and the licensee's findings are summarized below: Operation in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve asignificant hazards consideration as stated in 10 CFR 50.92 since it wouldnot: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. The removal of this surveillance requirementdoes not affect any accident as analyzed in the FSAR. Other surveillancerequirements exist in the Technical Specifications which ensure the operabilityof the scram discharge system to perform as required during a reactor protectionsystem actuation. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated. The elimination of an unnecessary surveillancerequirement and challenge to the reactor protection system cannot initiateor contribute to a new or different accident. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This surveillancerequirement was intended to demonstrate operability of the scram dischargesystem which is assumed in the FSAR accident analyses. Removal of thissurveillance has no effect on these analyses since the design of the modifiedsystem together with other Technical Specification surveillance requirementsassure the operability of the scram discharge system. The resulting eliminationof an unnecessary challenge to the reactor protection system is consistentwith industry and regulatory philosophy and goals. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination. Based on the review and the above discussion, the staffproposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>State University of New York,Penfield Library, Reference and Documents Department, Oswego, New York13126. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Charles M.

The changes are administrative and include:correction of misspelled words, deletion of expired pages, and correctionof grammatical errors. There are no setpoint changes, safety limit changes,surveillance requirement changes that were not previously evaluated, orchanges to any limiting conditions for operation. These changes have noimpact on plant safety or plant operations and will have no impact on previouslyevaluated accidents. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previouslyevaluated.

The proposed changes are to revise surveillancerequirement (SR) 4.6.5.6.a.1 by increasing the base current value from28 amperes to 32 amperes for the containment air return fan (CARF) motors.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>TVA provided the following information in its application to supportthe proposed changes: <ITAG tagnum="21">Review of the past performance data of Surveillance Instruction (SI)28, ``Containment Air Return Fans,'' has shown that the amperage windowof 28 277.5 amperes is too low. Amperage values obtained have consistentlyremained on the upper end of the allowed tolerance value and thereby indicatethe need for an increase in the base amperage value. This surveillanceamperage value should be increased to a value of 32 277.5 amperes to establisha new data baseline that will be used to verify the motor operability ofthe CARFs. </ITAG>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification change andhas determined that it does not represent a significant hazards considerationbased on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of SQN in accordancewith the proposed amendment will not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. As stated in the SQN FSAR, section6.6.1, the primary purpose of the CARFs is to enhance the ice condenserand containment spray heat removal operation by circulating air from theupper compartment to the lower compartment, through the ice condenser,and then back to the upper compartment. The secondary purpose of the systemis to limit hydrogen concentration in potentially stagnant regions by ensuringa flow of air to these regions. Therefore, increasing the base amperagefrom 28 to 32 amperes will not affect the system's function as previouslyevaluated. This change will enhance the ability to verify the CARF motoroperability by establishing a more realistic data baseline as a resultof actual plant test data. Therefore, the proposed change does not involvean increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previouslyevaluated because the system's operation and function are not affected.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. Increasing the base amperage in the amperagewindow of the CARF motors will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than previously analyzed. System operation and functionare not affected by this change. As previously stated, this change is beingmade to establish a more realistic data baseline for future surveillancetesting. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed becausethe system's operation and function are not affected by the change. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This changewill not involve a significant reduction in a safety margin of the CARFsystem. The amperage window is solely used to verify CARF motor operabilityand to allow for variations in board voltage due to changes in board loading.Neither system operation nor function will be affected by this change becauseit only establishes a more realistic data baseline for motor reliability,Therefore, no reduction in a margin of safety is involved by the proposedchange because the system's operation and function are not affected bythe change. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The amendment would also delete that portion of the LicenseCondition 2.F.(1) which referred to the Environmental Technical Specifications.Appendix B originally consisted of two types of specifications when issued,one related to radiological effluents and the other related to non-radiologicalenvironmental matters. Prior to this request, the NRC staff issued Amendment86 (July 2, 1985) which incorporated more comprehensive Technical Specificationson radiological effluents into Appendix A of the Operating License anddeleted these requirements from Appendix B of the Operating License. The second type of specifications originally contained in Appendix B involvemonitoring and reporting requirements associated with nonradiological environmentalmatters such as aquatic and land management.

The following Technical Specifications governingfire protection are proposed to be removed: 3/4.3.7.9, ``Fire Detection Instrumentation'' 3/4.7.6, ``Fire Suppression Systems'' 3/4.7.7, ``Fire Related Asseblies'' 6.2.2.e (Fire Brigade staffing requirements) Related bases sections would be modified and the index would be revisedto delete the sections removed. Generic Letters 86-10, dated April 24, 1986, and 88-12, dated August 2,1988, from the NRC provided guidance to licensees concerning removal ofthe fire protection technical specifications. The licensee's proposed amendmentfollows these Generic Letters. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed revisions to the license condition and to the technical specificationsare in accordance with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 86-10 forlicensees requesting removal of fire protection technical specifications.The incorporation of the NRC-approved fire protection program, and theformer technical specification requirements by reference to the proceduresimplementing these requirements, into the Final Safety Analysis Report(FSAR) and the use of the standard license condition on fire protectionwill ensure that the fire protection program, including the systems, theadministrative and technical controls, the organization, and the otherplant features associated with fire protection will be on a consistentstatus with other plant features described in the FSAR. The provisions of 10 CFR 50.59 would then apply to changes the licenseeconsiders making in the fire protection program. In this context the determinationof the involvement of an unreviewed safety question defined in 10 CFR 50.59(a)(2)would be made based on the ``accident...previously evaluated'' being thepostulated fire in the fire hazards analysis for the area affected by thechange. Hence the proposed license condition would establish an adequatebasis for defining the scope of changes to the fire protection programwhich can be made without prior Commission approval, i.e., without introductionof an unreviewed safety question. Neither the proposed license condition nor the removal of the existingtechnical specification requirements on fire protection creates the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.They also do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safetysince the license condition does not alter the requirement that an evaluationbe performed for the identification of an unreviewed safety question foreach proposed change in the fire protection protection program. Consequently,the proposed license condition for the removal of the fire protection requirementsdo not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The Administrative Controls section of the technical specifications (Section6) includes a requirement for fire protection program implementation procedures.This section will also be modified as necessary to define the roles ofthe Plant Operations Committee and the Corporate Nuclear Safety ReviewBoard in reviewing the fire protection program and implementing procedures.The fire protection program will be subject to administrative controlsconsistent with other programs addressed by license conditions. These changesare themselves administrative in nature and do not impact the operationof the facility in a manner that involves significant hazards considerations.The proposed amendment includes the removal of fire protection technicalspecifications in four areas: (1) fire detection systems, (2) fire suppressionsystems, (3) fire-rated assemblies (fire barriers), and (4) fire brigadestaffing requirements. While it is recognized that a comprehensive fireprotection program is essential to plant safety, many details of this programthat are currently addressed in technical specifications can be modifiedwithout affecting nuclear safety. These requirements being removed fromthe technical specifications have been incorporated into the fire protectionimplementing procedures. The administrative controls section of the technicalspecifications ensure that licensee initiated changes to these requirementswill receive careful review by qualified individuals. The transfer of these items from the technical specifications to a separatefire protection program is believed to be an administrative action whichdoes not impact the operation of the facility in a manner that involvessignificant hazards considerations. Based on the above considerations the Commission proposes to determinethat the requested changes to the WNP-2 License and Technical Specificationsinvolve no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland City Library, Swiftand Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorneys for licensees: </T3>Nicholas S.

Currently such mode changes are prohibited.Technical Specification 4.0.3 would be changed to delay compliance withan action statement for up to 24 hours in order to allow performance ofa missed surveillance. Currently the plant must be shutdown if a surveillanceinterval is inadvertently surpassed. Technical Specification 4.0.4 would be changed to allow the plant to proceedthrough or to required operational modes to comply with Action requirementseven though applicable surveillance requirements may not have been performed.Currently Technical Specifications 3.0.4 and 4.0.3 are in conflict whensuch a procession is necessary to come out of an Action statement. Theproposed revision would address the existing conflict. The amendment would remove the statement, ``..the provisions of Specification3.0.4 are not applicable,'' from the various Chapter 3 Limiting Conditionsfor Operation which do not require the shutdown since the proposed revision3.0.4 makes such wording superfluous. The licensee would retain the existingexceptions to 3.0.4 in those specifications that do require a plant shutdown.Bases associated with these specifications would also be revised. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The changes requested are to specifications 3.0.4, 4.0.3 and 4.0.4 andare as recommended by the staff in Generic Letter 87-09. The Supply System has evaluated this amendment request per 10 CFR 50.59and 50.92 and determined that it does not represent an unreviewed safetyquestion or a significant hazard. The proposed amendment does not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because: The change to Specification 3.0.4 will allow mode changes while the plantis in an Action statement that does not prohibit power operation. Exceptionto 3.0.4 has already been taken in many of the individual Action statements.Incorporating the proposed change into 3.0.4 will ensure that exceptionswill be consistently applied when justified. Deletion of the individualexceptions will have no impact upon the requirements in the Specificationssince the exception to 3.0.4 will now be contained within 3.0.4. The change to Specification 4.0.3 will allow delay in the application ofAction requirements for up to 24 hours when a surveillance has been missed.Because surveillances normally verify system or component operability,as opposed to discovering inoperability, the allowance of an additional24 hours to demonstrate operability is not significant. Without the 24hour delay it is likely that a missed surveillance would force a plantshutdown. Avoidance of this transient state and associated thermal cycling is beneficialand far outweighs any incremental uncertainties regarding system operabilityassociated with the additional 24 hours in which to perform a missed surveillance.The change to Specification 4.0.4 will not result in a change to the designor operation of the facility and is administrative in nature. For the reasonscited above, this change will not result in an increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because: The change to 3.0.4 will allow the plant to continue operation in an Actionstatement that already allows continued operation. As such, no new modesof operation are being introduced by this change. The change to 4.0.3 would allow the plant to continue operation for anadditional 24 hours after discovery of a missed surveillance. Missing asurveillance does not mean that a component or system is inoperable. Inmost cases surveillances demonstrate the continued operability of the componentsand systems. All systems and components currently required to be verifiedoperable by Technical Specification requirements will continue to be maintainedoperable. This change will not affect the design of the plant and willnot allow the plant to be operated outside the currently allowed modesof operation. The change to 4.0.4 will alleviate a contradiction within the specifications.This change is administrative and does not affect any of the accident analyses.(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because: The change to Specification 3.0.4 will allow mode changes in Action statementthat do not require plant shutdown. Exceptions to 3.0.4 are already containedwithin many of the applicable Action statements. Incorporating the exceptionswithin 3.0.4 will ensure their consistent application. The change to 4.0.3 will allow up to 24 hours to perform a missed surveillance.In most cases this will eliminate the need for a plant shutdown. The overalleffect is a net gain in plant safety due to avoidance of unnecessary shutdownsdue to missed surveillances. The change to 4.0.4 is administrative in nature and therefore does notaffect any margin of safety. Based on the above considerations the Commission proposes to determinethat the requested changes to the WNP-2 License and Technical Specificationsinvolve no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland City Library, Swiftand Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorneys for licensees: </T3>Nicholas S.

In making this request the licensee has noted that significant progresshas been made toward meeting the requirement prior to startup followingthe fourth outage. The fourth refueling outage is now scheduled to beginon April 28, 1989. This amendment application has been submitted to allowrestart in the event that requirements of the Regulatory Guide are notmet by the end of the outage. The Supply System has reviewed the requested amendment per 10 CFR 50.59and 50.92 and has determined that no unreviewed safety questions or significanthazards will result. Further, the licensee stated that the proposed changewill not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated because the existing instrumentationconsists of four redundant safety-related channels. Additionally, thereare unrelated systems in place to provide operators with sufficient datato assess reactor conditions (e.g., control rod position monitors, reactorvessel level and pressure monitors) in the unlikely event of an accidentcondition prior to replacement. (2) Create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident because no function of the flux monitor systemis being changed; therefore, no new or different kind of accident is conceivable.(3) Involve a significant reduction in a safety margin as adequate instrumentationis provided to allow the operator to assess reactor conditions withoutthis monitor in the unlikely event of an accident condition that couldcause the monitor currently in place to fail prior to replacement. Based on the above considerations the Commission proposes to determinethat the requested changes to the WNP-2 Technical Specifications involveno significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland City Library, Swiftand Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorneys for licensees: </T3>Nicholas S.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By May 19, 1989, the licensee may filea request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to thesubject facility operating license and any person whose interest may beaffected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party inthe proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requestsfor a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordancewith the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to interveneis filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition andthe Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board willissue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
