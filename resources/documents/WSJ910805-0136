The panel's 12-9 vote suggests that aspects of the billwill face substantial challenges when it reaches the fullSenate this fall. &quot;It's obvious that the bill as reported outisn't going to become law,&quot; said Sen. Pete Domenici (R.,N.M.).</LP><TEXT>   Six of the panel's 12 Democrats and three of the nineRepublicans opposed the broad plan to modernizeDepression-era bank laws. Many of the opponents raised thefear that the nation may have to bail out the banking systemjust as it's rescuing the savings-and-loan industry, andcomplained that the bill doesn't do enough to limit taxpayerliability.   In important respects, the Senate bill is similar tolegislation the House Banking Committee passed in June. Bothwould strengthen bank regulation, limit the scope of federaldeposit insurance, and allow banks to operate nationwidebranch systems. Versions of these basic elements almostcertainly will become law this fall as part of a billCongress must pass to bolster the sagging bankdeposit-insurance fund with long-term Treasury loans to berepaid by the banking industry. Both panels also have votedto allow banks to affiliate with securities firms, but thischange is more controversial.   Unlike the House committee, the Senate panel refused toallow commercial companies to purchase banks, a change theBush administration argues would bring more capital into thebanking industry. And in a victory for hard-lobbyinginsurance agents, the Senate bill would more severely rollback the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to sellinsurance.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady praised the Senate panelfor embracing &quot;comprehensive banking reform legislation.&quot;But, referring to continued separation of commerce andbanking, he said, &quot;We are disappointed that the bill doesn'tadopt provisions which permit private capital to flow freelyinto the banking industry ahead of the taxpayer.&quot; Mr. Bradyalso blamed the insurance sales provisions on &quot;the narrowview which has succeeded in restricting the existingauthority of banks to engage in profitable, low-riskfinancial activities.&quot;   The Senate panel's decisions on commercial ownership ofbanks and insurance could shrink the support for broadfinancial restructuring. Such companies as American ExpressCo., General Electric Co., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., and Sears,Roebuck andamp; Co. that have begun establishing financialsupermarkets offering credit card, brokerage, insurance andother services will have little incentive to support a billthat fences them out of commercial banking while allowingbanks into the securities business.   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle's primarygoal was to maintain the separation of commerce and banking.The Michigan Democrat was so successful in negotiatingcompromises supporting his view that Republicans never evenbrought the issue up.   The Senate bill is more liberal than the House version inallowing banks to use their capital to finance operations bytheir securities affiliates. Securities industryrepresentatives failed in their efforts to win stricter&quot;firewalls&quot; between banks and their securities affiliates,but they may have more success on the Senate floor and in theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, which deals with thesecurities industry and is considering the House bankingbill. Many of the Democrats who voted against the Senate billsaid it went too far in allowing banks into the securitiesbusiness. Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D., Md.) called the bill &quot;anassult on safety and soundness&quot; in banking.   Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American BankersAssociation, praised the bill for allowing banks into thesecurities business and for curbing the Federal DepositInsurance Corp.'s ability after 1994 to reimburse uninsureddeposits, as it frequently does when banks fail today. Thischange would help hold down the premiums that banks pay tothe bank insurance fund.   But he said the ABA is upset because the bill is &quot;loadedup with regulatory costs.&quot; The bill would require thatauditors of the nation's 2,000 largest banks -- those withassets of more than $150 million -- review internal controlson lending and other standards. Banks fear sharp increases inauditing costs. The ABA also is upset by a requirement thatbanks offer government check-cashing or small-fee checkingaccounts to low-income customers.   The American Association of Retired Persons fought hardfor this element of the legislation, arguing it would helpprovide banking services to the 16% of U.S. households thatdon't have bank accounts. The provision split the bankingindustry, because the Independent Bankers Association, whichrepresents small banks, supported the AARP in return for thegray lobby's aid in defeating efforts to place new limits onthe number of insured accounts a person can have.   The bankers are also worried about the cost implicationsof a provision to mint a new $1 coin.   But one of the banking industry's major objections to thebill is that it would reverse recent gains banks have madeinto insurance. The House and Senate bills would close aloophole that allowed national banks to sell insurancenationwide. The Senate bill would restrict Citicorp'sCitibank unit from using a Delaware law to underwrite andsell insurance nationwide. And after an emotional debate, theSenate panel adopted an amendment by Sen. Christopher Dodd(D., Conn.), one of the insurance industry's more influentialfriends, that would prevent bank affiliates from sellinginsurance in other states unless specifically allowed bystates.   &quot;The insurance industry is afraid of competition, andthey've won again,&quot; complained Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah).&quot;They want to maintain state regulation {of insurance}, butthey want to force national regulation on banks,&quot; he charged.Outraged, Mr. Garn said he's ending his longstanding supportof state regulation of insurance in favor of new federalsupervision, joining a movement that's under way in Congressto police the troubled industry.   Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas and William Roth ofDelaware both said they voted against the bill because theinsurance provisions would lead to &quot;the balkanization of theeconomy.&quot;   ---        Senate Committee's Banking Bill Highlights                                                                                                          FDIC RESCUE                                                                                                          The FDIC gets $70 billion in new borrowing authority toshore up the bank deposit insurance fund. Of the total, itcan borrow $25 billion from the Treasury to cover losses onbank failures; the banking industry has 15 years to repaythis loan and rebuild the fund through premiums it pays ondomestic deposits. Additional borrowing of $45 billion tomeet working capital needs would be repaid from sellingassets of failed banks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 There are no new limits on the number of insured accountsan individual can hold. Only the soundest banks could offerfederally insured brokered deposits. Insurance would nolonger cover bank investment contracts.                                                                                                          TOO BIG TO FAIL                                                                                                          The FDIC's current ability to deal with bank failures in away that reimburses all uninsured deposits -- those above$100,000 and foreign accounts -- would be sharply curtailedafter 1994. The Federal Reserve's ability to make extendeddiscount-window loans to ailing banks also would be limited.                                                                                                          BANK REGULATION                                                                                                          New auditing requirements would focus more attention onloan underwriting, asset concentration and other operatingstandards. Supervision will increase as a bank's capitaldeclines, and regulators must move more quickly to haltdividend payments or force a bank to raise more capital. TheFDIC must appoint conservators for banks when their capitalfalls below 2% of assets, rather than waiting until they'reinsolvent.                                                                                                          BRANCHING                                                                                                          Sound banks will be allowed to establish nationwide branchsystems, but states would have three years to vote toprohibit out-of-state banks from branching into the state.                                                                                                          SERVICES                                                                                                          Well-capitalized banks will be able to offer a broaderrange of services by affiliating with brokerage firms andmutual funds. The ability of banks to sell and underwriteinsurance would be scaled back. Banks must offer accountsthat provide government check-cashing or low-cost checkingservices to poor customers.
