For suppliers as well as buyers, the analysis of the supplyand demand pattern over the next 10 yr can be a useful exercise, especiallyif it highlights geopolitical realities and the influence of new technologies.This paper will attempt to answer two questions related to the marketingof natural uranium and enrichment services: (1) on a global basis (i.e.,for the Western World), are uranium and enrichment capacities now online sufficient to meet long-term demand. (2) On a regional basis (theUS, Europe, and Far East), what is the short-to-medium term pattern ofthe supply-and-demand balance.</TEXT></DOC>
