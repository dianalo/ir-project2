The faulttriggered a full load rejection of all generating units, causing lossof power to the spillway gates. Efforts to restart the units or provideauxiliary power to the gates were unsuccessful. As a result, the riverlevel rose quickly and water overtopped and breached project embankments.Portions of the power canal were eroded and the foundation of one powerhousewas partially washed away. The papers in this volume describe the accidentinvestigation, repairs to the mechanical structures, and repairs andimprovements to the electrical and control systems. Three separate abstractswere prepared for the papers in this report. (JDH)</TEXT></DOC>
