Also, people of Indian descent are being attacked morefrequently in the area around the port city of Durban, which hasthe largest Indian population.   Growing violence in an area that has suffered four years ofblack factional fighting ``has been linked to the raised politicaltemperature created by Mr. Mandela's release and his statement thatthe ... armed struggle would continue,'' said The Star ofJohannesburg, South Africa's largest daily.   A police statement Tuesday afternoon said: ``Although thesituation was somewhat quieter today, a number of deaths werereported from Natal and the eastern (Cape) province.''   Police headquarters in Pretoria said an officer who tried tostop three men from robbing a bus driver in a black township nearPietermaritzburg, the capital of Natal, was shot in the back andhacked to death.   An officer was shot in the stomach and two black men were killedwhen police fired at two clashing groups in Nxamalala, a Nataltownship, police reported. They said houses were burned and threeblack women were injured.   Police said two black men were stabbed to death and burned whenhouses were set ablaze in a factional fight in Kwanobuhle townshipnear Uitenhage in the eastern Cape province.   Brig. Jac Buchner, police commissioner for the Zulu homeland inNatal, said guns were used to kill 13 people in Mpumalanga townshipMonday, the day after Mandela's release.   He called it ``a worrying escalation'' in an area wherefirebombs, knives and sharpened sticks are the usual weapons. Morethan 2,500 people have been killed in the factional violence since1986.   Most of the Natal fighting was between supporters of the AfricanNational Congress and members of the Inkatha political organizationof Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu chief minister, but criminalelements were taking advantage of the chaos, police reported.   The newspaper Natal Witness reported concern about increasinganti-Indian sentiment in the townships around Durban.   Black crowds have attacked Indians four times in a week, twoIndian men were stabbed to death in Durban on Sunday and otherblacks rescued Indians from a mob, it reported.   Black marchers celebrating Mandela's release Sunday burned threeIndian stores and a gas station, witnesses said Tuesday. They saidpolice had fired on the marchers.   Thulebana Phewa, 16, limping from police buckshot wounds, saidthe attacks by 3,000 blacks on Indian stores were not racial. Hesaid people were angered when officers from a nearby police stationopened fire on a peaceful crowd in a squatter area outside Durbancalled Amahula.   Phewa said looters took 12 cows from the I.J. Hafferjee generalstore and slaughtered two before police fired shotguns andrecovered the remaining cattle.   Groups monitoring the unrest said a pamphlet was distributed inblack townships saying Indians controlled the Congress of SouthAfrican Trade Unions and had called strikes so black people wouldlose their jobs.   The pamphlet urged Zulus to unite against the labor federation,which is affiliated with Mandela's African National Congress.   Buthelezi said Tuesday the pamphlets had nothing to do with hisorganization or government.   ``I totally condemn any racist behavior and utterances directedagainst the Indian community and ask that a halt be called to allrumor mongering ... that may result in death and destruction,'' hesaid in a statement distributed by the independent South AfricanPress Association.</TEXT></DOC>
