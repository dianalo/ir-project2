Overturning a lower court ruling, the high court decided thatdisputes in which the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.takes over failing state-chartered thrifts should be decided by afederal judge, not in state courts. The Justice Department hadargued that the lower court ruling, if allowed to stand, could haveserious consequences for the FSLIC, which is under financialstrains to insure deposits in failing savings and loan associations.   In another decision, the high-court justices gave a boost tostate treasuries by ruling that states don't have to provide taxrelief for companies paying federal windfall profit taxes.   In a suit filed against New Jersey by 13 oil companies,including giants Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc., the high court saidan additional state tax does not unduly interfere with interstatecommerce since the companies operated numerous refineries in thatstate but do not drill for oil there.   The windfall tax, imposed by the Carter administration, wasrepealed by Congress last year but there may be some companiesstill paying on past earnings.   In the FSLIC dispute, the Supreme Court decided an insurer couldsue in federal court when it seeks to collect money, potentiallyhundreds of millions of dollars, allegedly owed to the failingthrift institutions.   The FSLIC acts as receiver in helping liquidate scores ofstate-chartered savings and loan institutions.   An appeals court had ruled in a case involving Manning Savingsand Loan Association in Illinois that the federal courts lackedsuch authority when the alleged violations of federal law aresecondary to related state law charges.   Former Manning directors were accused of declaring two illegaldividends in the early 1980s.   An Illinois regulatory agency ruled the dividends violate statelaw because Manning's net worth was insufficient. However, thedeadline for suing the Manning directors in Illinois state courtshad passed.   In other court rulings Monday, the justices:   _Agreed to decide whether defense contractors violate a federalconflict-of-interest law when paying severance to employees whoquit to take important government jobs. The court said it will hearappeals by the Boeing Co. and five former employees who received$485,000 in severance when they left to take jobs in the Reaganadministration.   _Dismissed a dispute over the confidentiality of lawyers'documents in a case stemming from a defense contractor's fraudulenttravel reimbursement scheme. The court refused to hear appeals byMartin Marietta Corp. and a former employee who said the company istrying to make him the scapegoat for the scheme.   _Left intact a ruling that permits widespread drug testing ofworkers in the nuclear power industry. The court turned away anappeal by workers applying for jobs with a company that doesmaintenance work on a nuclear plant in Washington state.   _Ordered reconsideration of a ruling that allows District ofColumbia officials to require drug testing for employees involvedin the busing of handicapped students. The justices had decidedlast month that drug and alcohol tests should be administered forrailway workers involved in accidents or jobs that require carryinga firearm.   _Refused to throw out an indictment accusing New York hotelowners Harry and Leona Helmsley of federal income tax evasion. Thecourt let stand a ruling that dismissed the Helmsleys' challenge tothe 47-count indictment.   _Refused to revive a lawsuit by Penthouse International stemmingfrom its failure to get financing for an Atlantic City, N.J.,casino. The court let stand a ruling that threw out a $128.7million judgment Penthouse won against a Virginia savings and loancompany and a Washington law firm.</TEXT></DOC>
