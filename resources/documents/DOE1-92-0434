Coal contains 5 - 40% level ofmineral components, and significantly cause abrasion before the reactorof the high pressure system. Because of the presence of these mineralcomponents, hydrogen is consumed in amount of 2 - 8 weight % to the amountof the supplied coal, causing the cost increase. This invention is pretreatingmethod wherein the raw material coal is sequentially treated first withgravitational separation and then with under-water granulation. Accordingto this invention, oil yield per unit hydrogen consumption is improved;as the content of the mineral components is less, the above-mentionedabrasion, clogging and corrosion are reduced. The under-water granulationin the latter stage reduces the water content in the purified coal. Sizeof the liquefaction unit gets less as the oil yield is improved. (2 figs,3 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
