The military announced it was replacing its top-ranking officersand said it had abolished the section in which the Communist Partyensured obedience from the military.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Friday that he was told that EastGermany is considering reducing its defense spending by 20 percentnext year.   The main body of New Forum, which claims membership of 200,000,decided earlier this week to remain a citizens' group rather thanfound a formal political party.   New Forum activists from five East German cities, however, metin Karl-Marx-Stadt and said they set up a committee to form theGerman Forum Party, the official news agency ADN said. The newparty will hold its founding convention on Jan. 27 and runcandidates in the May elections, ADN said.   There has been friction between New Forum founders, who aremainly based in East Berlin, and the more radical members of thegroup in the provinces.   New Forum was formed as a loose group of opposition activistsjust over two months ago, when the pro-democracy movement beganchallenging the hard-line Communist leadership.   The protests grew into massive street demonstrations that forcedthe ouster of hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker, democraticreforms and the resignation of the entire Communist leadership Dec.3.   In less the two months, East Germany opened the Berlin Wall andother borders and embarked on the path of democratic reforms thatwill culminate in the free elections.   Late Thursday, New Forum's national council issued a platformfor the elections, but said it still considered itself only anationwide citizens' movement.   The group said it was ready to assume political responsibility,strived for a ``mixed economy,'' and supported ''a specialrelationship'' with West Germany.   New Forum said it will offer an alternative for citizens who didnot trust other established parties and their willingness to carryout deep reforms. It said it supported a confederation with WestGermany.   The East German offer to trim 20 percent of its defense budget``could be very significant'' if it turns out to be true, said Sen.Levin. Levin said the figure came out during a meeting with DefenseMinister Theodor Hoffmann.   ``It adds evidence that there is a very significant reduction inthe threat from the East,'' said the senator, who added that lowerU.S. defense spending could be justified by the reforms beingintroduced in Eastern Europe.   East German officials had previously said the 1990 defensebudget would be at least 10 percent lower than the $13 billionreported for this year.   The Defense Ministry announced a series of new appointments thattake effect Monday.   Ministry spokesman Uwe Hempel told ADN that Gen. Horst Bruennerwas retiring after the abolition of the political administrationdepartment. The office dealt with ideological matters and ensuredCommunist policies and ideology were observed in the military.   The military also replaced the chief of staff and commanders ofthe navy, air force and land forces.   ADN gave no reason for the changes.</TEXT></DOC>
