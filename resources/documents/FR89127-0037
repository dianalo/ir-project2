Introduction</ITAG>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, as operating head of the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corporation (``FSLIC'' or the ``Corporation''), is proposingto adopt a new short-form application to be used by insured institutionsfor approval of routine reorganizations involving the creation of savingsand loan holding companies. We note that the Board is also proposing amendmentsto its regulations that would provide for automatic approval of such applicationson an expedited basis provided certain specified conditions are met.\1\<NOTE/> The purpose of this proposal, however, is to further streamlinethe application process by limiting the required contents of routine reorganizationapplications to information that is necessary to enable the Corporationto make an informed decision on an application consistent with its statutoryresponsibility.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>the Board's proposal to amend 12 CFR 574.7 by adding new subsections(a)(1) and (2) thereto, together with the explanatory statement accompanyingthe proposal, which is published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="85">II. Routine Holding Company Reorganizations</ITAG>During the past several years, the Board's staff has processed and approveda large number of applications by insured institutions to reorganize intoholding company structures. As a result of its experience with simple reorganizationapplications, the Board is aware that such transactions usually do notpresent unusual structural issues or raise significant law or policy concerns.The reorganization is almost always accomplished through a reverse triangularmerger transaction whereby an interim institution chartered under federalor state law is merged into the insured institution and each share of stockof the insured institution is exchanged for one share of stock of the newholding company.\2\<NOTE/> Furthermore, the new holding company engages in no operationsprior to consummation of the reorganization and its only significant assetimmediately after the transaction is its investment in the insured institutionsubsidiary. Shareholders of the insured institution generally have theopportunity to vote to approve or disapprove the reorganization and canexercise dissenters' rights of appraisal under applicable law if they donot vote in favor of the reorganization.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The shares of the new holding company issued to the formershareholders of the insured institution generally must be registered withthe Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') under the Securities Actof 1933, as amended. Nevertheless, the SEC staff, in recognition of thefact that a simple reorganization presents relatively minimal risk to shareholders,has adopted a streamlined and expedited registration procedure for suchtransactions. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin andplusmin;50, which originallycovered bank holding company formations only but is now applied to savingsand loan holding company formations as well, permits a registrant to omitfrom the applicable registration statement audited financial statementsand detailed statistical disclosure as long as certain conditions are satisfied.In addition, Instructions G to SEC Form S-4, which is the form utilizedfor most holding company formations, provides for the automatic effectivensssof the registration statement on the twentieth day after filing.Because the reorganization involves the acquisition of control of an insuredinstitution by the new holding company, an application to obtain priorapproval from the Corporation must be filed pursuant to the Savings andLoan Holding Company Act of 1967 (the ``Holding Company Act'').\3\<NOTE/> The appropriate application under current Board regulationsis Application H-(e)1.\4\<NOTE/> This application requires detailed and often voluminous informationon, among other things, the proposed transaction, the financial and managerialresources of the Applicant, the current business of the Applicant, andthe future prospects of the Applicant. The application also requires thefiling of detailed financial statements on both an historical and a proforma basis and certain exhibits. The Board believes much of the informationrequired in Application H-(e)1 is not necessary to enable the Corporationto make an informed decision on a simple reorganization application consistentwith its congressionally mandated responsibility to investigate the qualificationsof a potential acquiror and prevent the acquisition of control of an insuredinstitution in circumstances that might result in injury to the insuredinstitution. <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 997, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967). Therefore,the Board is proposing to adopt new Application H-(e)1-S to be used solelyby insured institutions seeking approval of simple reorganizations involvingthe creation of savings and loan holding companies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Holding Company Act prohibits any company, directlyor indirectly, or acting in concert with one or more other persons, orthrough one or more subsidiaries, or through one or more transactions,from acquiring control of one or more insured institutions without theprior written approval of the Corporation. 12 U.S.C. 1730a(e)(1)(B) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 12 CFR 574.6(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Eligibility for Use of Application H-(e)1-S</ITAG>In order to be eligible to use Application H-(e)1-S, an insured institutionmust be proposing a holding company reorganization transaction that qualifiesfor automatic approval under the Board's proposed amendments to 12 CFR574.7.\5\<NOTE/> These proposed amendments provide for automatic approvalof such applications 30 days after filing, as long as each condition specifiedin the proposed amendments are satisfied.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>footnote 1, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Contents of Application H-(e)1-S</ITAG>The Board's Office of Regulatory Activities, together with the Office ofGeneral Counsel, is currently considering the appropriate information tobe included in Application H-(e)1-S. The objective of this effort is tostreamline the application process by limiting the required contents ofroutine reorganization applications to information that is necessary toenable the Board to make an informed decision consistent with its statutoryresponsibility.
