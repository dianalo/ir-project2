The following summary also contains a list of submissions thatwere dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Glen Milner, 4/13/89, KFA-0127</T3>Glen Milner filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Albuquerque OperationsOffice of a request for information which he had submitted under the Freedomof Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE found thatthe authorizing official properly withheld portions of the requested materialunder Exemption 3 of the FOIA.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, 4/13/89, KFA-0132</T3>The Natural Resources Defense Council filed an Appeal from a denial bythe Director, DOE Office of Classification, of a Request for Informationwhich it had submitted under the Freedom of Information Act. In consideringthe Appeal, the DOE found that the documents at issue were properly withheldunder Exemption 3.

Although notified of the pendancy of this proceeding, Tampimexnever filed a Notice of Objection or other response to the Proposed RemedialOrder (PRO) that the Economic Regulatory Administration had issued to thefirm on July 24, 1987. As a result, the DOE found that Tampimex was deemedto consent to the issuance of the PRO in final form. The DOE further foundthat the PRO established a prima facie case of violations of 10 CFR 212.186and liability therefore. However, the DOE modified the remedial provisionsof the PRO to require Tampimex to remit the amount of overcharges, $8,524,448plus appropriate interest, to the DOE with instructions that the DOE willdeposit the sum into a suitable DOE escrow account for ultimate disbursementpursuant to procedures set forth in 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V.<ITAG tagnum="84">Motion for Discovery</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Carbonit Houston, Inc., Richard W. Johnson, 4/11/89, KRD-0620</T3>Carbonit Houston, Inc. and Richard W. Johnson (Respondents) filed a Motionfor Discovery in connection with their Statement of Objections to a ProposedRemedial Order (PRO) that was issued to the Respondents by the EconomicRegulatory Administration (ERA) on November 13, 1987. In the PRO, the ERAalleges that during the period January 1978 through December 1978, theRespondents engaged in a practice known as ``layering,'' prohibited underthe crude oil reseller price rules set forth at 10 CFR Part 212, SubpartL. 10 CFR 212.186 (the layering rule). The ERA also charges that Respondents'pricing practices were in violation of 10 CFR 210.62(c) (the normal businesspractice rule) and 10 CFR 205.202 (the anti-circumvention rule). In theirMotion for Discovery, the Respondents sought the ERA's responses to 29mostly multipart interrogatories and production of documents, relatingto: (i) The legal and factual bases of the PRO; (ii) contemporaneous constructiondiscovery of the pricing regulations at issue; (iii) administrative recorddiscovery of the layering rule, and the ERA's policy of assessing interestin PRO cases; and (iv) the ERA's audit and preparation of the PRO. In consideringthe Motion for Discovery, the DOE determined that the Respondents had failedto show that the discovery requested would lead to relevant and materialfactual evidence in support of their defenses to the PRO. Accordingly,the Respondents' Motion for Discovery was denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Implementation of Special Refund Procedures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Butler Fuel Corporation, </T3><T3>4/11/89, KEF-0094</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order implementing a plan for the distributionof $50,000 received pursuant to a Release issued by the U.S. Departmentof Justice on March 23, 1987.

Whitaker purchased directly from Exxon and is a resellerwhose allocable share is less than $5,000. On January 23, 1989, the DOEissued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) tentatively determining thatWhitaker's application be denied due to a false statement made by Whitakerin its application. The firm was permitted to file an explanation or anobjection to the PDO; Whitaker's subsequent explanation convinced the DOEthat Whitaker did not willfully provide false information. Thus, Whitaker'sApplication for Refund was approved and the firm was granted a refund equalto its allocable share plus interest. That amount was determined to be$3,360 ($2,864 in principal and $496 in interest).
