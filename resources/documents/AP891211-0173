Shultz said he is visiting Manila as a private citizen and thathis trip was planned by his company five months ago. He now is adirector of the Chicago-based Bechtel construction and engineeringconglomerate.   A seven-day military rebellion ended on Saturday when the lastrebel holdouts surrendered at Mactan air base, 350 miles south ofManila. The uprising killed at least 113 people and injured morethan 580.   ``I have a feeling that this effort by a renegade group in themilitary to overturn a democratic government has had a kind ofreverse effect,'' Shultz said.   He said the coup attempt ``galvanized the people, leading peopleto say that we struggled hard to get a free and democratic system ... and it is precious and so we have to fight for it and supportit.''   He said this will mean a strong following for the presentleadership, ``and so I continue to be bullish on the Philippines.''   Shultz said he and his wife have become close to Mrs. Aquino andwere invited by her to dinner Sunday.   ``She was in a very upbeat and feisty mood and I think it wasgreat,'' he reported.   He said U.S. air cover that was provided for loyal forces earlyin the insurrection was ``helpful'' in fighting the rebellion.   ``It would have been shameful'' for the U.S. government torefuse support to ``a friend ... a democracy under siege.''   ``I believe that President Bush handled it extremely well. It'sthe sort of thing that friends expect to see,'' Shultz added.   He also said the pro-democracy movement sweeping East Europe is``a phenomenon (that) is being replayed and the Philippines startedit.''   He was referring to the ``people power'' revolt that drove thelate President Ferdinand Marcos into Hawaiian exile and installedMrs. Aquino as president in February 1986.   Shultz on Monday called on Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, whosaid Shultz carried no message from Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
