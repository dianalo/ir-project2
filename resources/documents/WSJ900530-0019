Cystic fibrosis, a hereditary disease that affects one inevery 2,500 babies born in the U.S., is marked by thick lungsecretions that often lead to respiratory failure and deathby age 28. Currently, there are an estimated 30,000 youngpeople with the disease in this country.</LP><TEXT>   The experimental treatment is based upon a concept thathas been around since the 1950s. Decades ago, scientistsfound that a certain cow enzyme could dissolve excess amountsof DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the lung secretions, makingthem more liquid and easier to clear from the breathingpassages. But the cow enzyme provoked allergic reactions, andnever became standard treatment.   The biotech firm said its scientists used gene-splicingtechnology to insert the gene for the human form of thisenzyme into mammalian cells. The cells produce a purifiedform of the human enzyme, called DNase. Genentech said fewallergic reactions are expected because the engineered enzymemimics the natural form already found in the human body.   Genentech said it hopes to test DNase in an aerosolizedform in young adults with cystic fibrosis. After determiningits safety and appropriate dose levels, the company plans tolaunch studies in younger children.   If shown to be useful against cystic fibrosis, the drugmay be tested against other lung ailments, such as bacterialpneumonia, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, Genentech added.</TEXT></DOC>
