BirnbaumStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Making a small bow to political reality, Budget Director James Miller said the Reagan administration would be willing to consider easing the deficit targets under the Gramm-Rudman budget law.    Mr. Miller's comment signaled a change in the administration's position. President Reagan has previously insisted that Congress stick to the tough $108 billion deficit target for fiscal 1988, despite new estimates showing that to do so would require a cut of $60 billion to $75 billion from projected levels. But in the face of congressional pressure, Mr. Miller told reporters yesterday: &quot;We'd certainly talk about&quot; raising the targets, which would allow for a larger deficit.    Members of Congress from both parties are currently working on measures to revise the Gramm-Rudman budget law by raising the targets and reinstating a mechanism for automatic cuts should Congress and the administration miss those targets. The original mechanism was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.    These lawmakers hope to attach the changes to a bill raising the government's debt limit. The current limit on government debt expires Friday. Treasury officials say, however, that they have enough cash to operate through the end of this month without risking default on the government's obligations.    The debt-limit bill is turning into a hornet's nest for the Reagan administration. Two months ago, the White House agreed to negotiate changes in the budget process with Congress and to attach them to the debt-ceiling bill. However, disappointed by the results of those negotiations, the administration has changed course and now is calling for a &quot;clean&quot; debt-limit bill, one without amendments. The White House fears that Democrats are trying to set a Gramm-Rudman trap for the president that will force him to choose between higher taxes and large cuts in defense spending.    Despite pleas for a clean debt measure, however, Congress is clearly headed toward adding the Gramm-Rudman changes to the bill.    In addition, Congress may ignore the White House request for a long-term debt extension and pass a bill that carries only through September. That would give the Democrats an opportunity to attach their tax-increase bill to the next debt measure, in an effort to force the president to choose between a tax increase and an unprecedented government default.    House Democrats are also considering a plan that would extend the debt limit for just a few weeks, giving them more time to work out changes in the Gramm-Rudman law.    The expiration of the debt limit at midnight Friday means the Treasury will have to stop selling savings bonds and other debt instruments. If the debt limit isn't raised by July 23, the Treasury will have to pay cash to some 25,000 to 30,000 bill holders who in normal times swap their bills for new ones when they expire. If the limit isn't raised by the end of the month, the Treasury is unlikely to have the cash needed to pay off the $23 billion in Treasury securities that come due July 30 and 31.    Separately, the Congressional Budget Office told Congress that the budget deficit will rise to nearly $200 billion by fiscal 1989 if new cuts aren't made.    The budget office's latest estimates show the federal deficit at $161 billion in the current year, $181 billion next year and $198 billion in fiscal 1989. That's a sharp change from earlier this year, when estimates showed a slow but steady decline in the budget deficit. The change is largely from higher interest rates and slower economic growth than initially projected.    Mr. Miller told the Senate Budget Committee yesterday that the administration will have new deficit estimates ready next month. He said the Congressional Budget Office numbers probably aren't &quot;terribly out of line&quot; with the administration numbers, although the projected $198 billion deficit in fiscal 1989 &quot;is a bit big.&quot;    The House Budget Committee yesterday estimated that an across-the-board cut in government spending under a revised Gramm-Rudman law would slice nearly 6% from the military budget and 7.5% from nonmilitary programs. The estimate assumes that the revised law would require the $36 billion reduction in projected spending for fiscal 1988 that is being considered by lawmakers.    The Gramm-Rudman law, as simulated by the budget panel's staff, would require an $18 billion cut in projected military spending and in projected nonmilitary spending. But several programs would be exempt from cuts, including some of the largest social programs, such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps and a variety of programs intended to aid the poor. </TEXT></DOC>
