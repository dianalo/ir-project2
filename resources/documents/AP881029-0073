The ink and color portrait on a hanging silk scroll is ofMinamoto Yoritomo, the first of the shoguns _ military generals _who ruled Japan in the emperor's name from 1185 until the greatchanges in Japanese society following the arrival of the firstAmerican fleet in 1859.   One of 550 Japanese-owned works of art in the exhibit openinghere Sunday, the anonymous portrait of Yoritomo is designated a``national treasure'' in Japan. J. Carter Brown, the NationalGallery's director, called it ``the Mona Lisa of Japanese art.''   While Yoritomo was characterized in medieval military chroniclesas a brutal, ruthless warrior, the portrait of him attired in aformal silk robe sitted on a mat represents him as courtly figure.   Jumpei Kato, managing director of the Japan Foundation, saidYoritomo, despite his reputation as a warrior, led a subduedpersonal life.   ``He had no concubines -- he was too afraid of his wife,'' Katosaid.   Brown sees the exhibit, which has been five years in preparation,as a way to help bridge the gap between the civilizations of the twocountries.   ``These days there is no country more important than Japan to theUnited States,'' he said.   The final arrangments for bringing the exhibit to Washington weremade at a Tokyo conference of President Reagan and former PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone.   The exhibit includes paintings, sculpture, screens, scrolls,ceramics, textiles, door panels, swords, saddles, armor and otherobjects usually associated with such showings.   But the National Gallery also has built a stage in the main hallof its East Building for the presentation of elaborately costumedNoh _ ``talent'' translated in English _ dramas, the oldest form ofprofessional theater in Japan, dating back more than 500 years.   The exhibit also includes a replica of a Japanese tea house, thesmall thatched structures where members of the fuedal militaryheirarchy engaged in a highly cultivated ritual of giving andreceiving tea as an act of social communion.   During the exhibit, the huge metal mobile by American artistAlexander Calder that normally swings from the ceiling and dominatesthe East Hall, has been temporarily removed. Ruth Kaplan, a galleryspokeswoman, said the mobile is being cleaned and would not haveinterfered with the Japanese exhibit.   The exhibit is expected to attract several visitors from Japan,partly because the the elaborately but rarely staged Noh dramasthere and the gathering of so many other pieces of Japanese art intoone show.   So many American visitors are expected that the gallery has setup a system of reserving tickets for specific days and hours. Thetickets are free.   The show is called ``Japan: the Shaping of Daimyo Culture1185-1868.'' The daimyo were the great feudal lords who ruled Japanunder the shoguns. The exhibit will be on view until Jan. 23. Itwill not travel to any other city.</TEXT></DOC>
