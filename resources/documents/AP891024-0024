President Bush ``congratulates the Lebanese deputies for theircourage and statesmanship, which have yielded an extraordinaryopportunity to bring lasting peace in Lebanon,'' White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.   ``This is the first step toward restoration of a sovereign,unified, and independent Lebanon, free of all foreign forces,'' hesaid.   Gen. Michel Aoun put his Christian forces on alert aftercomplaining that the plan didn't provide a timetable for thewithdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon.   ``What the deputies approved in Taif is a crime I will notaccept,'' he said of the accord, approved Sunday by a specialparliamentary session in the Saudi Arabian city.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said theUnited States ``warmly welcomes'' the accord. However, she saidthere had been no change in U.S. policy calling for the withdrawalof Syrian troops that control a vast portion of Lebanon, andIsraeli forces that hold a security belt in the South.   The pro-Syrian mainstream Shiite Amal militia and thepro-Iranian fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, which isbelieved to be holding eight American hostages, rejected the accordbecause they want a bigger representation in a new parliament.   Apart from the troops issue, U.S. policy has called for a largerrole for Moslems in running Lebanon's government. Power is splitfairly evenly between Christians and Moslems.</TEXT></DOC>
