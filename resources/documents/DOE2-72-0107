Water, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons arethe essential suppliers of hydrogen for chemical engineering and biologicalsystems. The cost of energy to break up water into hydrogen and oxygenis too high to remain competitive in comparison with countries possessingcheaper sources of hydrogen such as methane or cheap electrical energy.Photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation show that a 'soft chemistry' forthe important mass products will still be long in coming. The barrieris the stability of water, so necessary for life. Primary energy sourcesare currently water power, fossil raw materials, nuclear power, and infuture solar power. Water power, fossil raw materials, and nuclear powerare converted into electrical energy, which can then be used to breakup water by electrolysis. Alternatively, fossil raw materials provideheat energy for separating hydrogen from water or methane. Solar powercan be directly converted into electrical energy, by means of solar cells.This makes the additional transformation stage via heat energy superfluous.</TEXT></DOC>
