And in the process he maligned his native land and many of his countrymen.    There is not one recorded case of pollution by the chemical industry in Ireland. Twenty-two of the 30 largest chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in the world have established production facilities in Ireland in the past three decades. Ireland's strict environmental protection laws ensure that these industries operate safely and cleanly. There have been no fish kills, no polluted rivers and no contaminated lakes that can be attributed to the chemical industry in Ireland.    The highly regarded Institute for Industrial Research andamp; Standards in Dublin published the last detailed evaluation of pollution in Ireland in 1977. The bottom line of that intensive study was that the chemical industry in Ireland got an environmental clean bill of health. More than that, the study fingered Irish farmers who dumped untreated, highly toxic pig manure and farm chemicals as the major culprit in those fortunately rare pollution incidents that have occurred in Ireland's inland lakes and rivers.    David O'Sullivan    Executive Director    Ireland United States Council for Commerce and Industry    New York    ---   Mr. Cockburn's column was written with a strong anti-industry bias and with inaccurate and misleading statements.    Merrell Dow selected the site near Killeagh, County Cork, for a plant after evaluation of more than 25 other sites in Ireland. The decision was based on economic considerations and the impression obtained through governmental and other contacts that the location was consistent with zoning practices and precedents in locating industries of this nature. The provisions of the Cork County Development Plan do not provide explicit guidelines on the restriction of industry to particular areas nor have any land-use principles evolved. The National Planning Appeals Board noted that &quot;the proposed development would not be injurious to the residential or visual amenities of the area or give rise to a public health hazard. The Board considers that the proposal would not militate against the development of agriculture or damage aquatic life or be otherwise contrary to the proper planning and development of the area.&quot;    This recommendation was issued after an eight-day public hearing, eight months after the planning application was filed in July 1988. The decision was appealed to the Irish High Court, which found last month there was no justification for the premise relied on by the objectors. No project proposal in Ireland has been subject to such extensive and intensive public review.    Merrell Dow has committed itself to design features and operating procedures that go far beyond current Irish standards and are equal to or more restrictive than those found in any country. For example, the use of low-sulfur fuel oil will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions to less than 15% of normal industrial levels -- less than from a creamery boiler.    The planning application included an environmental impact study by the Irish Science and Technology Agency. And we have commissioned a far more comprehensive environmental study to provide a scientific basis for future measurement of any possible adverse environmental effects. A community environmental consultative committee with representatives from all potentially affected publics has been formed and will have access to all operating data on performance of the plant environmental control systems.    The plant will provide as many as 300 jobs during the peak of construction. When the plant starts up, about 90 people will be directly employed with plans to increase employees to more than 200 within a few years. We expect that 65%-70% of these jobs will go to people in the Youghal/Killeagh area. (Not &quot;. . . just six jobs for common laborers from Youghal,&quot; as Mr. Cockburn stated.)    A small process incinerator was included in the plant design to destroy used solvents and sludges from the water-treatment plant at an efficiency in excess of 99.99%. No chemical wastes will be shipped off-site or used for landfill. There are no known precursors of dioxins in the waste materials to be incinerated. The overall plant design is unique in Ireland in venting virtually all process emissions to the incinerator for destruction of the organics. The result is that the plant would produce less pollution than the exhaust from a diesel engine or a coal fireplace.    The irony of Mr. Cockburn's column is that the proposed plant is exactly the type of investment Ireland should attract.    H.F.
