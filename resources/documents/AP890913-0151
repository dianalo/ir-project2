The House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee was thefirst panel to consider the Bush legislation, although the initialsession was reserved for opening remarks. Amendments that wouldbegin to shape a political compromise will be offered beginningTuesday, Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., said.   ``This bill is a delicate mosaic,'' said chief Republican sponsorNorman F. Lent of New York, who said he feared that the Energy andCommerce Committee might fashion a compromise that could unravel onthe House floor.   The president's bill seeks to significantly reduce the threemajor air pollution causes: ozone, which causes urban smog; acidrain, and airborne toxic chemicals.   The opening statements made clear that major battles will befought, beginning with the expected three-week subcommitteeconsideration, over reducing auto emissions, which also producesmog. Another fight: Do electric customers of dirty-burning powerplants get the entire bill for achieving acid rain reductions.   Other amendments will seek to ban tall industrial smokestacksthat merely carry pollution elsewhere; to increase protection fornational parks; to establish strict standards to protect health neartoxic chemical plants, and to ensure that no one fuel is favored ina program for alternative motor fuels.   Lent was upbeat about chances for passage of the bill thisCongress, commenting, ``Republicans will be far more willing tosupport a Bush bill than they would have been to support a bill bythe Democrats.''   GOP lawmakers had no such alternative the last eight years,because former President Reagan did not propose a clean air billduring his eight years in office. The last major clean air revisionswere approved in 1977.   Waxman repeated his determination to toughen Bush's language onauto emissions. He aims to tighten tailpipe emission requirements,to strip a provision to average pollution emissions by enginecategory and to require that on-board anti-pollution equipment beguaranteed for 100,000 miles, twice as long as in current law.   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., the chairman of the full Energyand Commerce Committee, is expected to oppose Waxman's changes andargue the auto industry's position. The automakers contend thatintroduction of new cars each year, with their sophisticatedanti-pollution devices, would bring a drastic cut auto pollution asolder models are replaced.   Dingell and Waxman have fought each other to a stalemate in thepast on this issue.   Lawmakers from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Georgia, Ohio,Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri are demandingthat other regions help them pay for acid rain reductions. Thesestates argue that, otherwise, their electric utility customers wouldfinance a disproportionate share of measures to cut emissions ofsulfur dioxide, the major component of acid rain.   Bush seeks to cut sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons by the year2000, based on 1980 levels. His bill places the entire burden onutilities with power plants that burn dirty, high-sulfur coal _which are prevalent in the nine states.</TEXT></DOC>
