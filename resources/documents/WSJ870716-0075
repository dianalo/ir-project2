This week, the president faces a showdown with Congress over the federal budget deficit. The crisis in the contest comes tomorrow, when the government's ability to borrow money expires.    But lawmakers, including many prominent members of the president's own party, are demanding that something be done to shrink the mounting deficit before they sanction the government to take on any more debt. Their method -- a repair of the now-toothless Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law -- has the president worried. It may finally force him to choose between two politically painful solutions: a sizable tax increase or a halt to his prized military buildup.    Reagan administration officials &quot;are between a rock and a hard spot,&quot; concludes Stephen Bell, a former congressional budget aide who now works for the Salomon Brothers Inc. investment house. &quot;Their friends are handing them an idea that will tie the president's hands.&quot;    So far, President Reagan is hanging tough. He is stumping the country saying he wants no tax increases, a continued boost in military spending and deep reductions in domestic spending. But Democrats are challenging him. Their own plan, which is slowly being written into legislation in Congress, raises taxes, cuts the military and keeps reductions in social programs to a minimum.    The long-simmering dispute is about to explode. Congress is expected to force the issue by attaching a reinvigorated Gramm-Rudman measure to a bill raising the debt ceiling. The new measure would mandate an across-the-board cut of $36 billion from projected levels in next year's budget if Congress and the president can't decide how to do the same amount of deficit reduction on their own. The new Gramm-Rudman provision is needed because the Supreme Court last year struck down the part of the law that made the cuts automatic.    Automatic budget slashing of this sort is a problem for the president. He could allow the across-the-board cuts to go into effect, but that would slam his pet military budget. He could compromise with the Democrats to avoid those Gramm-Rudman cuts, but that would mean accepting a significant tax increase. A third alternative would be to sidestep the Gramm-Rudman law entirely, perhaps by vetoing the debt-ceiling extension to which it's attached. But if he torpedoes the Gramm-Rudman changes, he risks sacrificing his own credibility as a fiscal conservative -- a possibility that has Democrats rubbing their hands in anticipation.    &quot;You might describe this as a choke point, when everything comes together,&quot; says Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) of the House Budget Committee. A repair of Gramm-Rudman, adds Rep. Richard Durbin (D., Ill.), &quot;is one of the few ways that could bring this thing to a head.&quot;    At the heart of the debate is fundamental disagreement on the nation's budget priorities. The consequence of failure to come to terms, because of the involvement of the debt-ceiling bill, could be the unprecedented default on U.S. government obligations. The irony is that budget &quot;reform,&quot; of which a strengthened Gramm-Rudman law is a central feature, is the president's chief domestic initiative this year.    &quot;It puts pressure on the president; it puts him in a bind,&quot; agrees Rep. Connie Mack of Florida, one of many congressional Republicans, loyal to the president, who are backing a reinvigorated Gramm-Rudman. &quot;But my No. 1 concern is cutting federal spending, and in order to get any kind of agreement, everybody has to be in some jeopardy.&quot;    Indeed, Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, all stand to lose something if Gramm-Rudman's stiff cutbacks go into effect. In the absence of a compromise deficit-reduction package, the automatic Gramm-Rudman cutbacks would pare a wide range of federal programs by between 6% and 8% compared with projected levels for the year that begins Oct. 1.    &quot;Gramm-Rudman is a mean, junkyard dog that bites everybody,&quot; Chairman Gray asserts.    The president's favorite programs would be especially battered by the exercise. According to congressional estimates, projected military budget authority next fiscal year would be slashed by about 6%, to $274 billion from this year's $290 billion. In contrast, President Reagan is seeking an increase of 3% on top of the expected inflation rate, to $312 billion.    Nonmilitary programs also would have a hard time, but many of the largest social-spending programs, which are most cherished by liberals, would be exempted from the cuts. These include Social Security, Medicaid, food stamps and a variety of other programs that aid the poor. The other nonmilitary programs would be reduced by $18 billion, or about 7.5%.    The theory behind Gramm-Rudman is that the severity of its reductions would push the president and the Congress into negotiations on a budget compromise. Indeed, House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) believes that invoking the Gramm-Rudman cuts would be a disaster for the country, and has prepared a version of the measure that would give the president discretion to prevent the cuts from taking effect.    Some White House officials argue that the best thing the president can do for the Republican Party is to continue to oppose any tax increases, even if that means accepting drastic cuts in defense. The public supports the president's desire to cut domestic spending and fight taxes, GOP strategists say, and would blame Congress for any damage done to the nation's defense.    Still, Democrats believe that they may finally have the president -- and his Republican Party -- on the defensive when it comes to the deficit issue. Recent polls are finding that more of those questioned think congressional Democrats can do a better job in shrinking the deficit than the president. So when Mr. Reagan spoke in Indianapolis this week about big-spending Democrats, the Democrats bought a full-page advertisement in the local newspaper headlined, &quot;Mr. President: It's Your Deficit.&quot;    Indeed, the Democrats' interest in keeping up the pressure on the president is one factor behind their drive to threaten him with a stengthened Gramm-Rudman law. Says Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.): &quot;We're trying to make a movie called, 'Ronald Reagan Meets Reality.'&quot;    ---                      Reagan's Budget Box            (For fiscal 1988 in billions of dollars)                             Military               Tax                             Budget Authority       Increase  Predident's request         $312                    6.2%  Congress's resolution        296                   19.3  Revised Gramm-Rudman         274                    0.0  Source: House Budget Committee staff</TEXT></DOC>
