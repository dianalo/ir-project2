Guild Chairwoman Margaret Zack said the vote was 233-70.   A lack of support from other unions at plant helped spur thereluctant membership to accept the contract after several hours ofdiscussion, union leaders said.   ``It's a bad deal. It's a rotten deal,'' said Jay Weiner, vicechairman of the negotiating committee. But Guild members fearedthey would be replaced in a prolonged strike, he said.   ``We could have struck, but without the other unions it wouldhave been extremely difficult,'' said strike coordinator SteveBrandt, who characterized the contract as ``punitive.''   ``It simply doesn't meet the needs of people trying to keeptheir standard of living intact,'' he said.   Star Tribune spokeswoman Bette Fenton said the newspaper was``back to work as usual.''   ``We had hoped from the very beginning that we were able toreach a fair and equitable settlement and we're pleased that we'vedone that,'' she said.   Brandt said the contract covers six years and includes bonusesin each of the first three years, and pay raises of 3.2 percent inthe fourth year, 3.1 percent in the fifth year and 3.0 percent inthe sixth year.   For top scale reporters, photographers, copy editors anddistrict circulation managers, the bonuses would be $2,000 in thefirst year, $1,750 in the second and $1,500 in the third, Brandtsaid.   The pay raises for top-scale employees would amount to about $26a week in each of the last three years, he said. Weiner said thepackage averages out to a 1.6 percent annual increase in pay scalesover six years. He called it ``worse by far'' than the recent dealstruck by Guild employees at the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch.   Supervisors worked on scaled-down editions of Thursday's paperuntil union members returned at about 10:15 p.m., Brandt said.   The union's original strike deadline was 4 p.m. Tuesday, butthat was extended to 4 p.m. Wednesday. As the deadline passed,union negotiators said they were waiting for the company's responseto a new offer they had made.   Other provisions of the tentative pact as described by Brandtinclude:   _Six employees would be removed from Guild jurisdiction, ratherthan the 26 originally proposed by the company.   _Mileage would increase 1 cent a mile, to 22 cents; the Guildhad sought an increase to 28 cents.   Union members have been working without a contract since theirthree-year pact expired July 31. The Minneapolis unit covers about300 newsroom employees and about 60 circulation and promotionworkers.   Under the old contract, top minimum weekly salaries for StarTribune Guild members have been $315.50 for copy aides; $742.50 forcirculation district managers; $812 for reporters, photographers,copy editors and promotion personnel; and $895.75 for some editors,the Guild said.</TEXT></DOC>
