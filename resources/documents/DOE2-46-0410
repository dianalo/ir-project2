Investigations are made of possible contributions of future technicalimprovements to reduction in the overall cost. Results suggest that nuclearpower generation will be the most efficient among the various electricsources because of its technology-intensive feature. Development of improvedlight water reactors is of special importance to achieve a high burn-upand reduced construction costs. In general, the fixed cost accounts fora large part of the overall nuclear power generation cost, indicatingthat a reduction in construction cost can greatly increase the economicefficiency. Changes in the yen's exchange rate seem to have little effecton the economics of nuclear power generation, which represents anotherfavorable aspect of this type of energy. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
