The move follows legislation passed last month by the Canadian parliament, allowing for the sale of as much as 45% of the stock of the government-owned concern.    Though the government of Canada will continue to hold a majority of Air Canada's shares, it has said it will act as a passive investor and won't exercise its right to vote. The shares also will be offered to Air Canada employees in all countries where such an offering is permitted.    The size of the issue was in line with many analysts' expectations. Late yesterday, some stockbrokers said they expect the shares to be priced at between C$9 and C$11 a share. The pricing is expected Sept. 26.    RBC Dominion Securities Inc. was appointed lead underwriter and Wood Gundy Inc. was named co-leader of the underwriting syndicate.    The shares won't be offered in the U.S. or other foreign markets, but foreigners could buy the shares on Canadian stock markets. Other than the Canadian government, no shareholder will be able to own more than 10% of Air Canada's publicly issued equity, and total foreign ownership will be restricted to 25%.    Some political analysts believe the airline moved quickly to offer shares to the Canadian public because of concern that an election might be called soon. Canada's opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties oppose the government's privatization of Air Canada and had warned that, if elected, they would keep government ownership of the airline.    Air Canada said proceeds of the offering would be used for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft, and for reducing debt.    Air Canada last month ordered 34 A-320 aircraft from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, in a transaction valued at C$1.8 billion. The A-320s will replace Air Canada's aging fleet of 34 Boeing Co. 727s. Also last month, the airline ordered three 767 extended-range passenger jets from Seattle-based Boeing, valued at about C$200 million, in addition to four extended-range 767s ordered last year.    Air Canada, the world's 14th-largest airline, hasn't received any new equity capital from the government in 11 years. It has reported a profit for nine of the past 11 years and in 1987 had net income of C$45.7 million on revenue of C$3.13 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
