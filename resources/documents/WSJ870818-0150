Excellent as the story was, it omitted one crucial aspect: how communities are helping impoverished people with AIDS. Here in San Francisco, many programs address the diverse problems that AIDS causes and almost all of them help, at least indirectly, to ease the financial burden of living with and dying of AIDS.    Our program, the AIDS Emergency Fund, deals directly with the financial devastation of AIDS. We give up to $1,000 per year to any person with AIDS whose income falls below $700 per month. The actual checks are written to the provider of the services rather than to the individual, but the individual sets the priorities for how the money is spent. Some choose to use our money for rent, others for their insurance premiums, still others to fly family in for what may well be a final visit.    The AIDS Emergency Fund is an all-volunteer organization, a fact that makes for a very low overhead; almost 95 cents out of every dollar we receive directly benefits those in need.    Our total budget this year is $309,000; last year it was $196,000. We receive less than 2% of our money from the government. About 15% of our money comes from corporations and foundations, including substantial donations from IBM, Sanwa Bank, E.G. Smith, the Lurie Foundation, and the Chicago Resource Center. The rest -- more than 80% of our total budget -- comes from the generosity of thousands of private individuals.    Given the very dark situation your article pointed out, our budget of $309,000 is not much. But it does represent an alternative to cursing the darkness. And our budget is growing. We expect to raise more than a half million dollars next year, and $700,000 the year after that. If readers would like to learn more about the AIDS Emergency Fund, or if corporations would like to make a donation, they can write to us at 1550 California St., Suite 3R, San Francisco, Calif. 94109.
