No financial details have been disclosed, but the Germanbanks -- Berliner Bank AG, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG andCommerzbank AG -- said they wanted to ensure the airlinewould have a low operating cost base to remain competitive inthe restructured German market. British Airways would hold a49% stake in the enterprise, to be called Deutsche BALuftfahrtunternehmen G.m.b.H.   Last year's German unification ended the exclusive rightswhich carriers of the World War II Allied powers had enjoyedover air routes to and from West Berlin.   Under German law, traffic on those routes would have hadto be cut back 20% as of April 1, but a government officialsaid that British Airways' minority participation in the newGerman venture allows it to sidestep this rule.                                                                                                          CONTRACT ENDS SHIPYARD STRIKE                                                                                                          Workers at South Korea's second largest shipyard accepteda new contract, ending a 12-day strike. Union leaders andmanagement at Daewoo Shipbuilding andamp; Machinery Ltd. agreedlast week on the pact, but ratification was delayed by theLunar New Year holiday. Union officials said 69% of votingmembers approved the contract, which provides for annualbonuses equivalent to six months' regular pay, an increase infamily allowances, and a greater voice in personnel affairs.   U.S. STARS PITCH JAPANESE GOODS                                                                                                          Switch to almost any channel in Tokyo, and one can findsome of Hollywood's biggest moneymakers pushing Japaneseproducts.

BRITAIN BACKS EC PLANS                                                                                                          Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd put Britain more clearlybehind current plans for a European Community foreign andsecurity policy. While stressing the need to keep close tieswith the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Mr.Hurd said the EC had to work more closely together oninternational affairs, including defense. Following a meetingwith EC foreign ministers, Mr. Hurd said he endorsed agradual political convergence which could help the EC reactmore quickly and convincingly on the international stage. Buthe insisted that decisions on foreign policy and defensecontinue on the basis of unanimity.                                                                                                          EC BEGINS FREEING AID TO SOVIETS                                                                                                          European Community foreign ministers decided to startfreeing $1 billion of aid to the Soviet Union, blocked inprotest over violent repression in the rebel Balticrepublics. The decision followed two hours of talks betweenPresident Mikhail Gorbachev and three of the 12 EC foreignministers. During the talks, the Soviet leader accusedWestern media of fomenting secession in his country, butreaffirmed his commitment to reform.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREANS HIT THE ROAD                                                                                                          South Korea had 3.4 million vehicles registered with thegovernment at the end of last year, up nearly 28% from a yearearlier, meaning that the number of vehicles running on SouthKorean highways increased at a rate of 2,012 a day. At thatpace, South Korea is expected to have more than 4 millionvehicles by the end of this year and 7.2 million vehicles by1995.                                                                                                          IRAQI DEBTS MAY COST FRANCE                                                                                                          France stands to lose as much as 25 billion francs ($4.97billion) in unpaid Iraqi debts and another 4 billion francsin interest as a result of the Gulf war.   Just under two-thirds of that is guaranteed by the Frenchgovernment, which is preparing to amend its 1991 budget,adding provisions for expected initial payments on thoseguarantees. The debts are spread out over several years, andFrench officials say extra 1991 provisions will total about 3billion francs.   Those provisions, together with other costs linked to thewar and the sluggish economy, will force the government tocut spending by 12 billion francs. French Finance MinisterPierre Beregovoy said that if war costs and revenue lossesexceed the anticipated 12 billion francs, he might have toask for a war tax.   Military goods such as jets and communications equipmentrepresent about 14 billion francs of the unpaid bills. Theremaining 11 billion francs is for civilian supplies, such ashighways.
