American Standard, a New York-based plumbing and airconditioning company, on Thursday accepted Kelso's $78-a-shareoffer. But the following day, Black andamp; Decker raised its bid forAmerican Standard to $77 a share from $73.   The Kelso offer began Monday and was scheduled to expire at12:01 a.m. EST April 1. Black andamp; Decker extended its offer to expireon the same day.   Despite the fact that Kelso's bid is about $30 million higher,Black andamp; Decker has maintained that its proposal is better ``inlight of the timing and probability of payment.''   Black andamp; Decker, a Towson, Md.-based tool and appliance maker, ishoping to benefit from nervous arbitrageurs who hold a majority ofAmerican Standard's stock and worry that Kelso might not be able tocome up with the financing to complete the transaction.   Tendering their shares to Black andamp; Decker still would ensure apremium price for American Standard's stock, which by lateafternoon Monday traded at $76.50 a share, up 87.5 cents, on theNew York Stock Exchange.   Kelso, however, said it was willing to raise its bid to win overshareholders, according to Monday's editions of the Wall StreetJournal.   ``We didn't come this far to be deterred by this kind ofresponse,'' Joseph Schuchert, Kelso's managing partner, told thenewspaper. ``We'll tender at $78 and see what they do. If it'snecessary to bump our tender offer, that's what we'll do.''   He said Kelso was unlikely to act until March 31.   Kelso officials did not return numerous telephone calls from TheAssociated Press on Monday.   Kelso specializes in leveraged buyouts involving employee stockownership plans, or ESOPs, a concept it pioneered about 30 yearsago.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely throughborrowed money repaid from the target company's profits or sale ofassets. ESOPs also are financed mostly with borrowed funds, butequity is divided among all of the company's workers, not just afew investors.   Kelso said it planned to finance the American Standardacquisition through a $250 million investment and several bankloans.</TEXT></DOC>
