The U.S. policy shift was balanced by the resolution's appeal toall nations to halt military aid to guerrillas in the region.However, the resolution specifically allows continued humanitarianaid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.   ``We call upon the governments of Nicaragua and Cuba to ceasetheir nine-year supply of weapons, ammunition, safe haven and otherlethal assistance to the FMLN insurgents in El Salvador,'' saidU.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun.   The FMLN is the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, theMarxist rebels fighting to overthrow El Salvador's conservativegovernment.   Okun said the United States voted for the resolution to showsupport for the Central American peace plan and for Nicaragua'splans to hold national elections in 1990.   The last time the Security Council considered the guerrilla warsin Central America was in 1985; until Thursday, the United Stateshad prevented consideration of the issue.   As recently as last spring, State Department spokesmen saidNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government had to adopt an array ofdemocratic reforms before the 11,000-member Contra forces would bedisbanded.   On Tuesday, though, the U.S. State Department's assistantsecretary in charge of Inter-American affairs, Bernard Aronson,would not rule out the possibility of disbanding and repatriatingthe force before Nicaragua's elections.   Aronson said a repatriation plan could be carried out ``whenthere are conditions that protect the security of the resistanceand their democratic rights.''   Most of the Contras have been living with their families inHonduran border camps since Congress halted military aid to them inFebruary 1988.   The Security Council resolution appeals to all nations ``whicheither openly or covertly supply aid to irregular forces orinsurrectional movements in the area (to) immediately halt suchaid, with the exception of the humanitarian aid'' that the UnitedStates is sending to the Contras.   The 15-member council adopted the resolution by consensus. Italso called on the Central American presidents to continue carryingout their 1987 peace plan, which calls for democracy in theregion's nations and an end to guerrilla wars.   The United Nations and Organization of American States haveagreed to provide poll watchers for presidential and parliamentaryelections in Nicaragua, set for Feb. 25, 1990.   Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica alsohave asked the United Nations to send a border patrol force to theregion to assure that no nation is used as a base by rebels seekingto overthrow a neighboring country's government.   That agreement, reached Feb. 14 at a summit meeting in ElSalvador, has been stalled by a dispute between Nicaragua andHonduras over the procedure for implementing it.   The permanent members of the Security Council are the UnitedStates, Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China. The currenttemporary members are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia,Finland, Malaysia, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.</TEXT></DOC>
