At the 1987 Hajj, thousands of Iranians organized politicaldemonstrations in Mecca and 402 people were killed in clashes withSaudi police. Iran boycotted the 1988 Hajj because of Saudirestrictions.   Iran's Shiite Moslem leaders have claimed that Saudi Arabia'sSunni Moslem monarchs are unworthy guardians of Islam's holiestshrines.   Abdel-Wahab Abdel-Wasei, the Saudi minister of religiousaffairs, issued a statement Saturday stressing that ``all Islamicstates including Iran (must) abide by the special arrangements fororganizing and defining the numbers coming to the holy sites toperform the Hajj rites.''   He referred to the decision adopted by the foreign ministers ofthe 46-nation Organization of Islamic Conference meeting in Jordanin March 1988. They approved the Saudi proposal to restrict thenumber of pilgrims until the completion of renovations andexpansion of facilities in the holy cities.   The quota was set at 1,000 pilgrims per million of thepopulation from each Islamic country.   Iran had been sending about 150,000 people annually to the Hajj,but the quota system reduced that number to 45,000.   The Saudi minister was responding to Iranian complaints that thequota blocked thousands of Iranians from performing the rites.   The Islamic faith requires that all Moslems who can afford itmake the pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime.   Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties with Iran in April 1988,saying Iran was trying to destabilize the region. The relationshave not been restored.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's Parliament, denouncedSaudi Arabia and the quota system earlier this year.   He said the Hajj pilgrimage ``must cease to be a hollow worshipand should be turned into an active ... assembly for the Islamicworld to raise its issues and problems.''</TEXT></DOC>
