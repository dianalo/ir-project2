Source: Knight-Ridder News Service; How toobserve the eclipse; People who stare at an eclipse without special eyeprotection risk permanent eye damage. Damage can occur in seconds -- and theeye's retina has no pain sensors, so there is no pain to warn the victim.;Making and using a pinhole projector:; 1: Get a large cardboard box (at least12&quot; by 12&quot; by 21&quot;); 2: Cut a 1/2 inch hole in the upper part of one end.; 3:Tape a piece of aluminum foil over the hole.; 4: With a pin, poke a small holein the aluminum foil.; 5: Tape a piece of white paper on the inside of thebox, at the end opposite the pinhole.; 6: Stand with your back to the sun.; 7:Hold the box over your head with the pinhole facing the sun.; 8: A small imageof the sun will be projected onto the white paper. To get a larger image, usea longer box.  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  SPACE; SCIENCE; INJURY; PREVENTION  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  FROM THE BAY AREA, the moon won't quite line up with the sun -- at its peak,it will obscure 56 percent of the sun.;    In San Jose, the eclipse will beginat 10:10 a.m., peak at 11:20 a.m. and end at 12:34 p.m.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Science andamp; Medicine  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOW TO WATCH WITHOUT HURTING YOUR EYES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See related stories pages 1E and 3E of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But if you want to watch the moon's progress across the sun, don't look atit directly. Staring at the sun during a partial eclipse is just as hazardousto your eyes as at any other time. You could quickly -- without feeling athing -- burn into your retina a permanent image of the crescent sun, causingsevere and permanent vision loss.;    Here is a summary of viewing guidelinesput together by astronomy groups:;    Most objects that have been suggestedover the years as eclipse-watching filters have proved unsafe or unreliable.These include layers of photographic film, smoked glass, black plastic garbagebags, sunglasses, polarizing filters and camera filters.;    A few things dowork for watching the eclipse with the naked eye:;    (check) Pieces ofarc-welder's glass labeled  14 and available at welding supply stores. Mostwelders' goggles are not suitable protection.;    (check) Two or three layersof Mylar plastic heavily coated with aluminum. Some stores are selling&quot;eclipse glasses&quot; made with this material.;    (check) It's safest to watchthe eclipse indirectly by projecting the sun's image through a pinhole andonto a sheet of white paper. One of the best methods is to assemble a pinholeprojector (see diagram and instructions).;    (check) If you don't have timefor any of these, look under a tree. The sun's image, projected throughopenings between leaves, should be scattered across the ground in dozens ofplaces.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  -- David Ansley  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910709  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DIAGRAM  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  455  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 9, 199100191225,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
