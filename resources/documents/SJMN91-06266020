Robert Kerrey ofNebraska, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia,and ex-California Gov. Edmund G. &quot;Jerry&quot; Brown Jr. would all be running forthe Democratic nomination for president in 1992 -- the year pin-striped partyinsiders have shrugged off as a cinch for George Bush?;   But it's apossibility -- and irony -- that's already building political steam. After adecade in which two-thirds of Democratic Washington collaborated with 90percent of GOP Washington to produce the biggest speculative financial bubblesince the Great Depression and a bipartisan opportunity society for Charlie H.Keating Jr., Michael Milken and Leona Helmsley, the big name Democraticinsiders have abdicated, unwilling to scuff their Guccis in a hopeless 1992election.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DEMOCRATS SING A POPULIST TUNE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary; Kevin Phillips, publisher of the American Political Report, isauthor of &quot;The Politics of Rich and Poor.&quot; He wrote this for the Los AngelesTimes.  </MEMO><TEXT>     This has produced something unexpected: What may be the 20th century'slargest array of populist and outsider presidential candidates, all callingfor a grass-roots revolt against Washington and its special interests.;  Americans may not yet appreciate the kind of rhetoric that's unfolding. Harkinis a feisty populist who accuses &quot;George Herbert Walker Bush&quot; of being a richman's president, and Kerrey is a moderate populist who couches hisanti-Establishment sentiment in the less fiery tones of a millionairebusinessman and Congressional Medal of Honor winner.;   Wilder proclaimed hiscandidacy by denouncing the modern two-party system of &quot;the party insideWashington, which makes the deals, and the rest of us -- the party outside --that has to pay for the deals with higher regressive taxes and wastefulspending.&quot; As for Clinton, he said, back in August, that he'd campaign &quot;as anoutsider, running against the established order of things.&quot;;   Then there'sBrown, who was even angrier a few weeks ago, signaling he might try to &quot;takeon not only George Bush but the entire corrupt system -- including thoseentrenched Democratic politicians who have turned our party from a voice ofopposition into a party of complicity.&quot;;   If you think some of this sounds alittle like George C. Wallace -- but without the race issue -- that's thepoint. One Brown adviser told the press that his man stands for Wallace'sthree key 1968 slogans: &quot;There's not a dime's worth of difference,&quot; &quot;Send thema message&quot; and &quot;Stand up for America.&quot;;   Let me stipulate: They don't meanall of it. They're politicians. Besides, the prohibitive odds on Bush'sre-election make the whole exercise somewhat academic.;   Yet there may be anopportunity. If some outsider Democrat gets 45 percent of the vote in 1992,holding Bush to a historically weak 55 percent, that could signal an upheavaltaking shape for 1996.;   Moreover, many Americans forget how powerful angerand alienation has been in U.S. political history: Fighting the Bank of theUnited States and the political establishment helped Andrew Jackson bringabout a political watershed in 1828; Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans ranagainst the Southern &quot;slaveocracy&quot; and Dixie control of government in 1860;William Jennings Bryan seized the Democratic nomination -- but narrowly lostthe election -- in 1896, by challenging Wall Street and government for therich; Franklin D. Roosevelt started a new Democratic era in mid-Depression1932, after calling for throwing the money-changers out of the temple and theGOP out of the White House; and Nixon started a Republican era in 1968, with apromise to empower &quot;Middle America&quot; and unseat the &quot;Liberal Establishment.&quot;;  Maybe the current anger at bipartisan &quot;insider&quot; Washington in general andalleged GOP complicity with the rich can't develop that same intensity. Butmaybe it can. Earlier this year, the Kettering Foundation commissioned anational survey to figure out why Americans were so disillusioned withpolitics. Foundation President David Matthews summed up the answer: &quot;Peoplepoint their fingers at politicians, at powerful lobbyists and at people in themedia. They see these three groups as a political class, the rulers of anoligarchy that has replaced democracy.&quot;;   So maybe what Democrats arestarting to say is what a frustrated public wants to hear. Without a largerdownturn in the economy, none of these people will unseat Bush -- but that'snot necessarily the yardstick. Most major turning points of U.S. presidentialpolitics have been preceded by elections where the soon-to-triumph party andideology lost because it was too early. This was evident from 1824, whenJackson lost his first White House run, down to 1964, when Barry M.Goldwater's defeat was soon followed by two decades of GOP presidents.;   Ofcourse, populism has its problems. One is that U.S. populists don't speak witha national accent, but with a multitude of regional dialects, not easilybrought together. Harkin's agrarian frustration has a different accent thanthe urban populism in the Italian neighborhoods of Mario M. Cuomo's New York,which in turn is a far cry from that of Wallace country in the piney woods ofsoutheast Alabama.;   A second difficulty is that populism and liberalismaren't the same thing. If any of those Democrats don't know the difference --populism likes flags, criticizes welfare as well as Wall Street and keeps agun in the pick-up truck -- they'll learn it soon enough.;   Caveat No. 3 isthat the 1992 Bush campaign is almost sure to pick up where it left off in1988: With hard-hitting speeches and TV ads designed to resurrect liberalism'snot entirely undeserved reputation as a chicken-hearted, criminal-coddling,minority-pampering, taxpayer-subsidized rescue service for exotic wildlife andchild pornography distributors.;   Still another weakness ofpopulist-outsiders is that they're rarely credible in the president'schief-of-state role. They're hard to imagine as dinner partners for QueenElizabeth, sophisticated collaborators of the Federal Reserve in a financialcrisis or orators for the nation in some solemn moment.;   The upshot is thatno flat-out populist has ever been elected president. Populism has never hadmore than a partial influence -- either through an outsider politician withsome larger credentials (for example, Jackson's military record or Nixon'sforeign-policy experience) or because populist objectives caught on from along national dialogue to become conventional wisdom and infuse the policiesof establishment politicians such as Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson orFranklin Roosevelt.;   The angriest populist-outsiders of 1991-'92 -- Harkinand Brown -- may fit this tradition of personal unsaleability as occupants ofthe Oval Office.;   Yet it's equally true that the boldest and cleverestpopulists and outsiders of 1991-'92 have an opportunity to develop a nationaldialogue that will change the political economics of the next decade.;  Still, because Democrats are Democrats, it's always possible that autumn'swarriors will become winter's wienies -- contribution-seekers in thepenthouses of millionaire vegetarians, re-emergent acolytes of outdatedcivil-rights lobbies and avid co-conspirators of the National Union ofUnnecessary Government Employees.;   For now, however, that sound someDemocrats are hearing is something they haven't heard for a long time: Theunmistakable sound of one of American history's great political trumpets.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KEVIN PHILLIPS  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910922  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,191  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 22, 199100266020,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
