(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>[Figures have been omitted]andM;Two absorbance detectors are available for the HP 1050 Series modular LCsystem: a high-sensitivity programmable scanning detector and a high-speed,multiple wavelength diode array detector.andM;THE MOST IMPORTANT DETECTION PRINCIPLE in liquid chromatography (LC) isabsorbance detection in the ultraviolet and visible wavelength ran s. Samplemolecules with chromophore groups absorb light and are excited into higherelectronic energy levels.andP;  The observed spectrum, a plot of light absorbed asa function of wavelength, is characteristic for any species and is thereforehelpful in identifying compounds previously separated in a liquidchromatography column.andM;There are two types of LC absorbance detectors, each having its own specialfeatures and characteristics.andP;  The first is the forward optics detector.andO;White light is separated by a wavelength dispersive element-typically agrating and one selected wavelength passes through the sample in a flow cellof an LC system.andP;  This type of detector is set to one wavelength at a time.andO;Spectra can only be acquired by stopping the pump flow and turning thegrating from one position to the next to change the wavelength in the cell.andO;In the early 1980s, HP introduced the reverse optics detector.andP;  White lightfirst passes through the flow cell, where it is attenuated at wavelengthscharacteristic of the sample molecules.andP;  It is then separated and directed bya grating towards a diode array.andP;  Each diode detects light in a very narrowwavelength range, and there are enough diodes that all wavelengths ofinterest are detected simultaneously.andP;  Originally used for pure research,diode array techniques are beginning to be used for routine analysis inquality control laboratories.andP;  An invention of the 1970s, the holographicallyfabricated concave grating, can resolve the wavelength range on a nearlylinear focal curve.andP;  This kind of self-scanning photodiode-array detector canproduce dozens of spectra in a second, on-line.andP;  With a microcomputerhandling the resulting data stream, a speed unattainable with forward opticsdetectors is achieved in the measurement of separated compounds.andP;  For the HP1050 Series Liquid Chromatographs, the forward optics technique is now drivento its highest sensitivity so far with the HP 79853A Variable WavelengthDetector (VWD), while the HP 79854A Multiple Wavelength Detector (MWD), thereverse optics solution, features a wide range of spectral capabilities.andM;Theoretical BackgroundandM;The basic equation for absorbance spectrometry is the Lambert-Beer law:andM;The absorbance signal can be corrected for offset and dark currents simply bymeasuring these currents during an analysis.andP;  Stray light is the main factorlimiting the detector's linearity.andP;  Stray light is an intrinsic property ofwavelength dispersive elements, which means that gratings of the highestquality are absolutely necessary.andP;  In the HP 79854A MWD, stray light is lessthan 1/1000 of the sample light, resulting in a linearity error of less than1% up to 1.andP;  5 AU.andM;Flow Cell Trade-OffsandM;According to the Lambert-Beer law, a longer path length gives acorrespondingly higher signal.andP;  However, longer path lengths result in largervolumes, increasing the dispersion of the separated peaks.andP;  Reducing thevolume with a long path length reduces the light throughput, corresponding toa relatively higher (absorbance) signal level, but at a higher noise level.andO;A further constraint comes from an &quot;Iron Rule&quot; of chromatography, which saysthat no more than 10% of the original resolution must be lost in thedetection system.andP;  This means that the volume of the flow cell must be:andM;[V.sub.cell]  andless; 0.5 [V.sub.r / NandM;where [V.sub.r] = retention volumeandM;N = number of theoretical plates (a column parameter).andM;For these reasons, all absorbance detector designs are trade-offs betweenpath length, cell volume, and total photon flux, which is controlled by theelement with the smallest light conductivity, the flow cell.andM;Signal-to-Noise RatioandM;In addition to the path length of the flow cell and the dispersion of theeluted peak, signal-to-noise ratio is a limiting factor in detectorperformance.andM;In modeling the noise contributions in a photometric absorbance detector,three types of noise need to be considered: Schottky noise, independentnoise, and proportional noise.andP;  There is also a relationship betweenphotometric noise (noise associated with the photometric signal) and outputsignal noise:andM;Output Signal             Photometric NoiseandM;Noise (AU)         2.3 x (Photometric Signal)andM;Schottky Noise.andP;  Schottky noise is always associated with direct currentflow, for example in diodes and transistors.andP;  In this case the Schottky noiseis associated with the photocurrent generated by the photodiodes.andP;  The rmsSchottky noise current [I.sub.s.rms] on a photometric signal [I.sub.ph] is:andM;[I.sub.s.rms] (amperes) = [Square rt.andP;  2qI.sub.ph.BW,]andM;where q is the charge of the electron and BW is the electrical bandwidth.andP;  Indetectors, it is more convenient to work with the peak-to-peak value of thenoise, which is approximatelyandM;[I.sub.s.p-p] (amperes) = [6I.sub.s.rms] = 6[Square rt.andP;  2qI.sub.ph.BW.]andM;The response on the chromatographic baseline is:andM;[I.sub.s.p-p] (AU) =andM;[I.sub.p-p (amperes) /andM;[2.3I.sub.ph] (amperes)  =  6[Square rt.andP;  2qI.sub.ph.BW] / [2.3I.sub.ph]andM;Independent Noise.andP;  This noise term is seen as a fixed amount of noisesuperimposed on the photometric signal.andP;  It is mainly generated by theelectronics (amplifiers, analogto-digital converters, etc.) and isindependent of the level of the photometric signal.andP;  It can be expressed as:andM;[I.sub.i p-p] (amperes) = constant = [f(I.sub.ph]) -  The response on thechromatographic baseline is:andM;[I.sub.i p-p (AU) =  I.sub.i p-p (amperes) /andM;[2.3I.sub.ph] (amperes)andM;Proportional Noise.andP;  This noise term is proportional to the photometricsignal.andP;  It comes mainly from lamp instabilities and gain variations in theelectronics.andP;  It can be expressed as:andM;[I.sub.p p-p (amperes) = [kI.sub.ph]= 2.3 X [10.sup.-5 I.sub.ph] The responseon the chromatographic baseline is:andM;[I.sub.p p-p] (AU) = [I.sub.pp-p] (amperes) /andM;[2.3I.sub.ph] (amperes)  =andM;[kI.sub.ph] / [2.3I.sub.ph] = k / 2.3 = [10.sup.-5]andM;Total Noise.andP;  The total noise on a chromatographic signal is:andM;[I.sub.t] (AU) = [Square rt.I.sub.s.sup.2] + [I.sub.i.sup.2] + [Isub.p.sup.2]andM;The result of this model is shown in Fig.andP;  1.andP;  Within the operating range ofthe detector, the total noise of the system approaches very closely thetheoretical limit, which is the Schottky noise.andM;Variable Wavelength DetectorandM;Features of the HP 79853A Variable Wavelength Detector include highsensitivity with low noise and drift, and versatility in the form ofprogrammable wavelength, autozero capability, and interchangeable cells.andO;This detector has a single-channel output.andP;  Time-programmable wavelengthswitching and stop-flow scanning make it possible to take a spectrum to finda wavelength with optimum sensitivity for a given chromatographic peak,thereby achieving maximum sensitivity.andP;  Scanning Absorbance Detector OpticsandM;In the optical system of this detector (Fig.andP;  2), radiation from a deuteriumlamp is focused on the entrance slit of a monochromator by means of sphericaland plane mirrors.andP;  In the monochromator, a 1200-line/mm grating in a highlyefficient Monk-Gillieson optical system spatially disperses the beam andfocuses the selected portion of it on the exit slit, which has an 8-nmoptical bandwidth.andP;  The beam passes through a flow cell which has an 8-microvolume and a 10-mm path length, and the transmitted light is converted by asample photodiode into an electrical signal.andP;  To compensate for intensityfluctuations of the light source, a beamsplitter in the monochromator directspart of the light to a reference photodiode.andP;  Wavelength selection is made byrotating the grating, which is driven by a stepper motor.andP;  An optical unitcasting contains all items: mirrors, beamsplitter, grating assembly, and twophotodiode assemblies.andP;  The deuterium lamp is located in a separatecompartment attached to the casting.andM;Flow cell construction follows a classical steel cell concept.andP;  A steelhousing contains the Suprasil windows, gaskets, screws, and other parts.andP;  Theinlet capillary is coiled around the housing, forming an efficient heatexchanger.andP;  The assembly is part of a cassette that can be removed from theinstrument for cell inspection.andP;  A simple sheet-metal case, which follows HPstandard appearance design guidelines, contains all subassemblies: theoptical unit with its cell cassette, the power supply, analog-to-digital anddigital-to-analog converters, the microprocessor, and the user interface.andM;Data Acquisition and ProcessingandM;One of the main goals in designing a signal path is to find a solution thatprovides operation as near as possible to the theoretical noise limit, whichis the Schottky noise of the photocurrent.andP;  This means that the electroniccircuits, including the light source and the photodiodes, must add a minimalamount of noise above this limit.andP;  Other goals are to provide signalfiltering matched to the chemical applications and time tables to changeparameters during an analysis.andP;  Fig.andP;  3 shows the block diagram of the HP79853A Detector.andP;  Light energy is converted to photocurrent by silicon pinphotodiodes, which generate photocurrents as large as 10 nA.andP;  Because thelight intensity varies significantly with wavelength, the preamplifier gainis increased from a normal value of 1 to 2, 4, or 8 depending on the actualphotocurrent.andP;  The next stage is a channel selector connecting theanalog-to-digital converter (ADC) input to the sample or reference photodiodeor to analog ground for offset compensation measurement.andP;  The ADC is anintegrating type with a basic conversion frequency of 1.2 kHz, generating apulse width signal proportional to the input voltage.andP;  Twenty-four conversioncycles and some waiting time are summed, resulting in an 18-bit ADC with25-ms conversion time.andP;  This speed is more than adequate for LC purposes,even for the fastest chromatographic applications.andM;As mentioned earlier, compensation using a reference photodiode providesadvantages in suppressing commonmode effects.andP;  It is best to use identicalparts for measuring the sample and reference photocurrents.andP;  Therefore, onlythe photodiodes and the first op amps are individual parts.andP;  All other partsin the signal path, including the ADC, are identical.andP;  With this design it ispossible to guarantee drift values of less than 5 X [10.sup.-4] AU per hour.andM;A 7810 one-chip microprocessor clocked at 12 MHz is used for all control anddata handling operations.andP;  Corresponding to the user-selected signal responsetime (0.25, 1, or 4 seconds) the 18-bit ADC data is low-pass filtered andconverted to absorbance data according to the equation;andM;A(Lambdal) = log(reference data) - log(sample data).andM;This does not normally result in A(Lamgdal) = 0 for a nonabsorbing probe, asrequired by the Lambert-Beer law, because the solvent itself and the cellabsorb some light.andP;  To compensate, a balance is performed.andP;  just beforestarting an analysis the actual absorbance is measured and stored, and allfuture absorbance computations are corrected by this value.andM;The data output of the CPU consists of two different types: data to bedisplayed and data for the analog output signal of the detector.andP;  The displayis a 16-character singleline vacuum fluorescent display with 5 x 7 dot matrixcharacters.andP;  For the analog output signal, a digital-to-analog converter(DAC) operates on the digital data.andM;The dynamic requirements of the DAC are determined by signal and noiseconsiderations.andP;  The value represented by one least-significant bit must besmall compared to the minimum signal level, which here is noise.andP;  Thefull-scale analog output corresponds to 2 AU (by definition), and the minimumnoise is 2 X [10.sup.-5] AU.andP;  The result is that 1 LSB must be less than 1 x[10.sup.-5] AU or the dynamic range must be greater than 200,000.andO;Consequently, an 18-bit DAC is needed.andP;  To obtain this dynamic range withmonotonic behavior, two-stage DAC principle was chosen.andP;  The first stage isan 11-bit pulse width modulated DAC with 20-bit accuracy operating at a183-Hz repetition rate.andP;  The output of this stage enables 7 bits of a secondmonolithic DAC.andP;  The two DAC outputs are added, resulting in the required 18bits.andP;  Low-pass filtering suppresses the ac content to a negligible amount.andM;Besides signal data handling, the microprocessor has some further tasks toperform.andP;  For safety reasons, a leak detector near the cell is monitored witha built-in 8-bit ADC.andP;  In case of any malfunction, appropriate not-ready anderror messages are activated.andP;  The microprocessor also generates the bitpattern for the step motor to change the wavelength, and takes care ofdeuterium lamp control, shutter movement for suppression of opticalsecond-order diffraction (optical low-pass filter), and remote control inputand output for synchronizing the operation of all connected LC modules.andM;Detector ControlandM;Users of LC detectors are commonly chemists or persons in chemical labs.andO;They need easy access to the most important functions with a self-explanatorydisplay and keyboard.andP;  This is quite difficult because the space for thekeyboard is limited and because access to 26 different parameters andfunctions must be provided.andP;  In addition, about ten special functions forservice purposes are available.andP;  In the HP 79853A, the most frequently neededfunctions are directly accessed via corresponding keys (deuterium lampon/off, start/stop analysis, wavelength selection, and balance).andP;  Theremaining functions are accessible via a special control key plus anidentification number.andP;  All control functions can be reached either in thisway or by scrolling forward and backward with up and down keys.andP;  The firstfive control functions are those related to spectrum acquisition and spectraldata output.andP;  There are also automated functions allowing tasks like findingthe wavelength with maximum absorbance in a measured spectrum and switchingon or off the deuterium lamp after a predefined time interval to extend thelife of the lamp.andM;Multiple Wavelength DetectorandM;The HP 79854A Multiple Wavelength Detector is designed for customers who neednot only signal sensitivity but also spectral sensitivity and moreinformation.andP;  This detector features simultaneous dual-wavelength monitoringand on-line peak purity checks.andM;The main objectives for the development team were to achieve the highestpossible sensitivity in terms of noise, wander and drift, to reduce spectralnoise to its theoretical minimum, to make the instrument insensitive torefractive index changes with temperature, and to implement enoughfunctionality to make the instrument a useful tool in both research andquality assurance labs.andM;MWD Optical SystemandM;Fig.andP;  4 shows the optical system of the HP 79854A.andP;  The radiation source is adeuterium discharge lamp that has a wavelength range of 190 to 600 nm.andP;  Lightis collected by an achromatic lens system and directed onto the spectrometerslit, which is 120  am wide and 635 [micro]m high.andP;  In the plane of the slita 1:2 reduced image of the lamp aperture is formed.andP;  The slit is part of thecylindrical flow cell, which is made of quartz and has a path length of 6 mmand a cylindrical volume of 8  microl.andP;  By designing for an optimum fitbetween solid angle, image size, and flow cell geometry, wall effects(reflections at the cell walls and refractive index sensitivity) are avoidedand a high photon flux is achieved.andM;A holographic concave grating disperses the emergent radiation linearly ontoa photodiode array.andP;  The array consists of a row of 211 individual siliconphotodiodes with a center-to-center spacing of 61 [micro]m.andP;  205 diodes areused for the 410-nm-wide wavelength range, so the dispersion factor is 2 nmper diode.andP;  Because of the 120-/Am slit width the signal bandwidth is 4 nm, atrade-off between spectral resolution and high light throughput.1 A cut-offfilter placed before the array removes second-order spectra.andM;The required spectral dispersion as a function of wavelength determines thegroove density of the grating.andP;  Grating aberrations-spectral planefocus,astigmatic focus, and coma-have to be minimized over the spectral range ofinterest.andP;  Fabrication of a flat-field master grating is done via holographicrecording techniques, that is, a 3D interference pattern is produced by twocoherent point sources (their positions can be calculated from known imagingproperties and the required dispersion).andP;  By means of an appropriate grooveprofile the amount of light into a desired spectral order can be controlled(70% efficiency at 225 nm).andP;  Final grating production is by replicationprocesses.andM;A shutter positioned between the lens system and the flow cell can cut offthe radiation for dark current compensation or interpose a holmium oxidefilter into the radiation path.andP;  With its characteristic spectrum, the filtercalibrates the photodiode array for a correct wavelength scale.andM;The casting containing all optical components is mounted on a sheet-metalbase.andP;  The cell area and all capillaries are easily accessible by opening thefront door.andP;  All electronics, including the power supply, ADC and DAC, dataacquisition unit, and central processing unit, is located behind the opticsin the rear half of the box and is easily accessible for service andupgrades.andM;For a good noise profile, the temperature variation in the optical setupneeds to be as low as possible.andP;  Heat dissipation occurs at the lamp position(100 degrees C) and in the cell, the latter caused by the flow of solventpreviously heated in the LC column oven (up to 100 degrees C).andP;  There is alsodissipation over the capillary steel walls.andP;  Active cooling is doneseparately by two fans.andP;  The first is adjacent to the lamp compartment, andthe second is behind a large heat exchanger.andP;  Both take in air from the frontof the box.andP;  A small heat exchanger is attached directly to the cell forfine-tuning the temperature profile.andM;Signal ElectronicsandM;The self-scanning photodiode arrays are built on silicon semiconductormaterial and consist of a number of photocells connected to a common output(video line) by means of electronic switches.andP;  The switches of the individualphotocells are controlled by a shift register so that the photocells are readsequentially according to the shift register clock signal.andP;  The common outputis connected to a charge amplifier.andM;A schematic diagram of a self-scanning photodiode array is shown in Fig.andP;  5.andO;Each photocell has an associated capacitor [C.sub.di], which represents thejunction capacitance of the photodiode or, in some cases, is a capacitorseparately added on the chip.andP;  In operation, the capacitors of the photocellsare initially charged to a fixed value by scanning all photocells.andM;When photons penetrate the photosensitive material, charge carriers aregenerated, which discharge the capacitors according to the number of photonswithin a given integration period.andP;  When a particular photocell is connectedto the common output, its capacitor is recharged from the charge amplifierand the amount of charge required represents the discharge level of thatcell's capacitor, which is proportional to the incident light level duringthat integration period.andP;  Before each charge transfer from the chargeamplifier to a photocell, the reset switch RS is closed to null the chargeamplifier and prepare it for the next transfer.andM;The charge amplifier integrates its input signal so that the voltage changeat its output is proportional to the integral of the incident light levelduring the integration period.andP;  This signal is further processed by anamplifier, a sample and-hold circuit, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC),and a microprocessor.andM;Analog-to-Digital ConverterandM;The ADC combines the benefits of the successive approximation technique andthe advantages of the dual-slope algorithm.andP;  The benefits of successiveapproximation are high resolution of 16 bits, or steps of 76  AV over a 5Vinput range, and a high conversion rate of 18,000 readings per second.andP;  Thedual-slope algorithm provides low noise, a good temperature coefficient,excellent differential linearity, and low manufacturing costs.andP;  The ADC isonly required to make relative, not absolute, voltage measurements.andP;  Thedual-slope-based conversion principle is called triples-slope integrationbecause of the three different parts of the integrator voltage waveform (Fig.andO;6).andM;A schematic drawing of the ADC is shown in Fig.andP;  7.andP;  The input voltage comingfrom the photodiode array passes through a level shifter and a variable-gainstage before charging the integration capacitor.andP;  A very fast comparatordetects the zero crossings of the integrator voltage (critical areas aroundthe zero level are amplified to avoid comparator toggling) and triggers thedigital timing logic, which switches the discharge currents and controls thecounters.andP;  After the conversion the corrected counter content is loaded intothe output data register as the 16-bit conversion result.andM;One difference between the triple-slope integration technique and commondual-slope techniques is that the integrating capacitor is charged by aconstant voltage instead of by a voltage dependent current during a fixedcharge time.andP;  Therefore, no autozero step is necessary between readings toremove the charge remaining from the previous conversion.andP;  Thus the number oferror-inducing high-speed switches is minimized and a typical overall noiselevel of + or - 0.5 LSB (least-significant bit = 76 micro-V) is achieved.andM;The other main difference solves the great disadvantage of the dual-slopeprinciple, the relatively slow conversion rate, by using two bipolardischarging currents with a constant ratio of [I.sub.1] = - [128I.sub.2].andO;The conversion rate is increased by a factor of about 64.andP;  An internalcorrection bit makes it possible to eliminate various switching delay errorsby providing additional time to drive the integrator voltage to the zerolevel.andM;The capacitor discharge times are measured by a single comparator circuit toeliminate offset voltages.andP;  The output digital data word is the result ofmultiplying the upper nine data bits by the weight of 128 and adding thecorrection bit and the lower seven data bits.andM;To achieve the full speed advantages of this technique, a pipelined signalflow prepares the next diode voltage to be switched to the integrator whilethe current conversion is running.andP;  At the same time the data word resultingfrom the previous cycle is kept in the output latches to be fetched by thefront-end microprocessor.andP;  This pipelining concept reduces the timingrequirements for the processor enormously by keeping the computed resultstable for the time needed for a full conversion cycle.andM;A small on-board diagnostic circuit is provided to test the ADC with twoconstant internal voltages and an additional ramp voltage covering nearly thefull input range, using only the digital output data as test results.andP;  Thus agood ADC test is possible even if there are malfunctions elsewhere in theelectronics.andM;Data Processing and ArchitectureandM;Processing is split between a small preprocessor system and the mainprocessor system (see Fig.andP;  8).andP;  The preprocessor takes care of array datareadout and control of the diode array.andP;  The main processor is responsiblefor data calculation, I/O, and user interface handling.andM;HP's first fast scanning detector, the multiwave length HP 79880A, had asimilar architecture, using a fast bit-slice front-end processor and a Z80Amain processor.andP;  For the new HP 79854A, the costly and chip-consumingbit-slice preprocessor is replaced by a standard 6809 preprocessor.andP;  The mainprocessor is a standard 68008.andP;  Performance is maintained, but the chip countis reduced by two thirds, reliability is increased, and the cost is reducedby one third.andM;The 6809 preprocessor system controls the array and gain switching hardwareto set the correct gain for each diode, and it synchronizes the array cyclewith the 12.5-ms data processing cycle.andP;  It also captures data coming fromthe ADC with a period of 55 micro-s (18,000 words/s), filters the valuesseparately for each diode, and block-transfers 20 raw intensity-scan recordsper second to the main processor.andM;The 68008 main processor, running under a multitasking operating system,handles the local keyboard input, display output, and DAC control and doesthe complex calculations necessary to provide chromatographic signals andspectra at the analog outputs.andP;  Since the main-processor load is critical,the main processor is interrupted by the preprocessor only when a completescan record is available for processing.andM;The main processor corrects the raw intensity data from the preprocessor fordark and electronic offsets.andP;  The corrected record represents the lightintensity distribution over the wavelength range from 190 to 600 nm.andP;  Thisrecord, called a raw intensity scan, is used to build chromatographic signalsand spectra.andP;  Six raw signals are generated by bunching (adding) intensitiesin the wavelength domain to get the desired center wavelength and bandwidth.andO;These raw signals are filtered in the time domain according to the requiredpeak width, that is, the filter length and output data rate are set toproduce the number of data samples needed to reconstruct the peak shape,height, and area correctly.andP;  To get the absorbance values, the filtered rawsignals are log-converted and referenced to the background.andP;  Finally, thedata rate is converted from the current sample rate to the DAC output rate tomake the chromatographic absorbance signal available for analog output.andM;As shown in Fig.andP;  8, the first step in spectrum processing is bunching theintensity data for each wavelength in the time domain up to the desiredacquisition time, which also depends on the peak width.andP;  Next, the logarithmis calculated and the background scan is subtracted.andP;  The result, theabsorbance spectrum, is stored in spectrum memory, which holds up to tenspectra.andM;Calibration values, used to set the correct gain for each diode and tocorrect the raw intensity values, are measured during a special calibrationcycle on request and the results are stored in control and correction tablesfor continuous use during normal measurements.andM;Detector FunctionsandM;The user can predefine three different sample wavelengths and three differentreference wavelengths and change them in a time program.andP;  Unwanted impuritieswithin a chromatogram can be subtracted from the sample signal by simplysetting the reference to a wavelength where only an impurity spectral bandexists.andP;  Arithmetic is possible not only with signals but also with spectra.andO;Spectra are taken instantaneously on demand or can be programmed and stored.andO;Subtraction of spectra from the same or other runs (baseline spectra) is doneoff-line.andM;For identification of unknown compounds, a quick means of creating achromatogram with the highest signal to-noise ratio per peak is desirable.andO;Diode array technology offers on-line information about the wavelength withthe highest absorbance in the cell for each peak.andP;  This helps in choosing theright wavelengths for a successful time program.andM;TroubleshootingandM;Unfortunately, the detector can't tell whether unnatural noise or signalbehavior is caused by an LC system malfunction or a detector failure.andP;  Forexample, the noise might be too low or too high, the baseline might berandomly or regularly spiked, or microwander and jumps might occur.andP;  For themultiwave length detector, troubleshooting starts by exchanging the flow cellwith the test cell and cutting off the flow path from the detector.andP;  Then thedetector self-test or various test functions can be invoked.andP;  Error messages,such as leak detected, error in other module, lamp ignition failed, lowintensity, or wavelength calibration out of range, may be helpful incorrecting a malfunction.andP;  There is a lamp intensity test to check the outputof the light source.andP;  The holmium spectrum can be measured to monitor straylight in the LJV range, and for an electronic noise test the lamp isdisconnected and the signal path from the diode array to the electronics ischecked.andP;  The printed circuit boards have their own specialized tests.andP;  Thegain factors of the ADC can be measured, and the DAC can be tested using abuilt-in test pattern as input.andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;We would like to thank Bernhard Dehmer who designed the packaging system,Hubert Wilbs who contributed to the optical unit, Claus Lueth who designedthe central processing board, and Karsten Kraiczek who helped with the heatexchanger design and test software development.andP;
