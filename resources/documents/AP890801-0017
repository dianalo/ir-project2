On Friday, I said that the taking of any hostage was not helpfulto the Middle East peace process. The brutal and tragic events oftoday have underscored the validity of that statement.   That position, and our firm opposition to negotiating withhostage takers, was further reinforced in my discussions thisevening within the administration and in consultations with thecongressional leadership.   Tonight I wish to go beyond that statement with an urgent callto all, all parties, who hold hostages in the Middle East torelease them forthwith, as a humanitarian gesture, to begin toreverse the cycle of violence in that region.</TEXT></DOC>
