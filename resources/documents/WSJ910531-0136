To this day, national leaders still payhomage to Wang Jinxi, an oil driller who, according to theofficial biography, exhorted 40,000 workers to work &quot;till ourshoulders come off]&quot; back in the 1960s.   But that kind of Daqing spirit may force the country backon a low-fuel diet. While Beijing allows foreigners toexplore offshore and even onshore in 11 southern provinces, amixture of national pride, security concerns and possiblyselfishness has led many senior petroleum officials to insiston going it alone in the exploration and development of theTarim basin in the far west of the country, China's last oilfrontier.</LP><TEXT>   More recently, dire shortages of capital have promptedBeijing to loosen somewhat its tough stand against foreignexploration in western China -- an area long targeted byforeign oil companies seeking exploration rights. But foreignoil executives say that unless the door is thrown wide opento foreign capital and technology, China may not be able tofind oil in time to head off a serious energy crisis later inthe decade and keep the country's economic powerhouse goingin the 21st century.   &quot;The Chinese have been saying all along that they wouldundertake exploration alone,&quot; says an official of IdemitsuOil Development Co. of Japan. &quot;It won't be easy for themeconomically and technically.&quot;   Nonsense, counters Kang Mingzhang, an official of theinternational bureau at China National Petroleum Corp., orCNPC, in Beijing. &quot;Foreigners always brag about theirsuperior technology,&quot; says the official. &quot;We've seen throughtheir ploy in the past 10 years. With all their technology,foreign companies aren't able to extract oil in the SouthChina Sea. We have loads of experience drilling onshore. Wedon't need them.&quot;   China's reluctance to open Tarim to foreign participationis part of its overall problem with opening the country tooutside interests. While Beijing welcomes foreign capital andtechnology, it resents having to share management control andprofit.   Barring new discoveries, China's oil-supply outlook isbleak. Both the Daqing field, which alone accounts for 40% oftotal oil output, and the Shengli field, which accounts foran additional 25%, are drying up. Meanwhile, foreign oilcompanies have spent $2.3 billion on exploration and foundonly small fields in the Bohai Bay and South China Seabasins.   According to China's projection, the country's oil outputwill grow modestly to 2.8 million barrels a day in 1995 from2.7 million barrels a day last year. Offshore oil output isexpected to reach 153,000 barrels a day by 1995, comparedwith negligible production last year.   Researchers at the East-West Center in Honolulu say China,the world's sixth-largest oil producer, could even become anet importer of oil before the turn of the decade -- aworrisome prospect for a country that counts on oil exportrevenue to help repay foreign debts.   All hopes now are on Tarim, China's biggest explorationtarget. The basin is larger than France and contains theworld's second-biggest desert. The extent of its oil reserveshas yet to be verified, but the official press already saysTarim contains more oil than Saudi Arabia. (Granted, the samecomparison was used to describe the potential in offshoreoil.) However vast the reserves may be, getting themextracted and transported would cost billions. It's estimatedthat Tarim development could cost about $20 billion.   Foreign companies are interested in participating.Following intensive lobbying efforts led by Mobil Corp. andExxon Corp., China's State Council, or cabinet, called ameeting of senior petroleum officials in 1989 to discussopening western basins to foreign exploration. Advocates forforeign participation cited the problems of cash shortagesand inadequate technology. But the nationalistic officialswho dominate the conservative CNPC won out: The conferenceendorsed the principle of selfreliance and barred foreignersfrom the western basins.   The work went well until last year, when Beijing, hobbledby big fiscal deficit, drastically cut back the budget forexploration and told CNPC to come up with funds itself. Butthe state oil concern, saddled with an official policy thatprices crude oil below cost, is practically broke.   With cash short on all sides, Beijing has begun to relaxthe policy barring foreigners from western China basins. Lastmonth, Japan National Oil Corp. signed an agreement to donatemoney and personnel to assist seismic surveys in Tarim.   At the same time, CNPC has quietly approached severalmajor Japanese trading firms, including Idemitsu Oil,Mitsubishi Corp. and Nissho Iwai Corp., to finance theconstruction of the Xinjiang-East China oil pipeline, whichis expected to cost more than $1 billion. Negotiationsstalled, however, when CNPC balked at suggestions that oilfrom proven reserves such as those in Daqing or Shengli beused to repay the loan.   Western oil companies would prefer to bear the expense andrisk of doing the exploration themselves and so claim abigger portion of any discoveries. But this kind of jointinvestment and development, which has been widely adopted inoffshore exploration, has been ruled out for western China'sbasins.   China limited foreign oil involvement to offshoredevelopment until 1986. But when that restriction was lifted,foreigners were given access to only 11 southern provinces,where the basins were small. So far, there is only oneserious taker, a consortium led by the oil subsidiary ofFletcher Challenge Ltd. of New Zealand that is just beginningto explore in the Dongting basin in central China.   Many foreign oil executives have criticized China foropening up the less-promising basins. &quot;Beijing officials areessentially telling foreigners this: `We've looked at thebasins and found no oil, but why don't you give it a try,'&quot;says a U.S. oil official.   Cheng Xirong, a senior geologist at CNPC, says the Chinesehad foreigners' best interests at heart when they ruled outjoint development in Tarim. &quot;If they find oil, how are theygoing to haul it from the desert to the coast for export?&quot; heasks.   Some say the Chinese want to keep foreigners out of Tarimdevelopment because they fear a lack of control overproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
