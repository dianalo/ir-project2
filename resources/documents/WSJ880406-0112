Martin Pompadur left his post as president of Ziff Corp. in 1982, he and a group of associates persuaded 260 investors to fork over $100,000 each to finance a buy-out of the company's four network affiliated TV stations.    Since then, Mr. Pompadur and his partners have quietly amassed a formidable media empire by spending over $1 billion of other people's money. He is negotiating now for what may be his most ambitious and expensive purchase yet: the Prince George's County, Md., cable system recently put up for sale by Prime Cable Corp. While he won't discuss the talks, Mr. Pompadur is said by industry people to be the high bidder at over $2,700 per subscriber, or about $200 million.    Meanwhile, his earliest backers are about to get the payoff. With the $26 million he raised to buy the Ziff stations, his Television Station Partners borrowed additional funds to meet the $64 million purchase price. Last week, he said he plans to put the stations on the market; at current prices, he expects the station group to fetch about $150 million.    The 52-year-old Mr. Pompadur recently completed the second public offering of his ML Media Partners with Elton H. Rule, 70, who was vice chairman of American Broadcasting Cos. until 1984, before its 1986 acquisition by Capital Cities Inc. In all, ML has raised more than $300 million from public investors to buy media assets.    Separately, Mr. Pompadur persuaded General Electric Credit Corp. to provide more than $400 million to finance a series of cable TV acquisitions, including last month's $225 million purchase of Essex Cable Corp.    As a result of his increasingly aggressive acquisition campaign, Mr. Pompadur has quickly built a reputation as &quot;a major player&quot; in the media business, according to Paul Kagan, who runs a media investment and analysis firm. &quot;But he's not here to run a Capital Cities type of company for 30 years -- he's in it to invest, operate, upgrade, and sell.&quot; And says Elliot Stein Jr., who is Mr. Pompadur's partner in several Hispanic media properties, &quot;There really isn't anyone else around who's put together so many companies so quickly, with so much earning power.&quot;    Mr. Pompadur's success in large part reflects the explosion of interest in virtually any investment related to media properties. And his various partners and backers apparently trust that he can ferret out hot media properties that are undervalued or poorly managed, turn them around with the aid of hands-on managers, and usually sell at a profit three to seven years later.    Mr. Pompadur, who was president of the ABC network before joining Ziff, initially planned to buy more network affiliated TV stations in 1986, after he and Mr. Rule raised $190 million for their ML Media in limited partnership units through Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. But, recalls Mr. Pompadur, &quot;we got out there with the money and there was nothing much to buy.&quot;    That's when Mr. Pompadur started bidding for cable properties -- and paying top dollar. &quot;He's certainly contributed to the run-up in prices for cable systems,&quot; says Mr. Kagan. For example, Mr. Pompadur stunned the industry last year when he paid $1,750 per subscriber for a 110,000-subscriber system in California -- but as Mr. Kagan notes, such systems are now selling for well over $2,000 per subscriber.    Mr. Pompadur says he's confident he will turn a profit for his investors and continue to find new undervalued media properties. But he acknowledges that the field is becoming more competitive all the time. The second Pompadur-Rule limited partnership offering, ML Media Opportunity Partners, which just raised $112 million, &quot;will be more venturesome and more speculative,&quot; he says. &quot;We may have to be more leveraged and buy things that are real turnaround situations,&quot; such as magazines.    Given the riskier profile of ML Media Opportunity Partners, industry executives say its performance in the current skittish market is impressive. Last month, just six weeks after Mr. Pompadur and Mr. Rule set out to raise $100 million, the partnership had sold $112 million in $5,000 units. &quot;That's a hell of a lot of people who like what Marty Pompadur and Elton Rule are doing,&quot; says John Waller, president of cable investment banking and brokerage concern Waller Capital Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
