Rosch highlights SoftKlone's communications package,Mirror III; Xpercom's Thoughtline software; Wells American's computer, theCompuStar; Terus Corp.'s indexed text-retrieval program, MINDS; and BinaryEngineering's x-y charting software for engineers, Tech*Graph*Pad.andM;Mirror III: A Better ReflectionandM;The official upgrade from idiosyncratic but wildly popular Crosstalk XVI,version 3.6, takes you to the powerful, imposing and almost impenetrableCrosstalk Mark IV.andP;  But if you've grown attached to the command-orientedoriginal and don't want to transfer to a new programming paradigm, you'llfind a new friend in Mirror III, from SoftKlone Distributing Corp., ofTallahassee, Fla.andM;The original Mirror was an out-and-out copy of Crosstalk.andP;  This latest $99.95upgrade continues with the hallmarks of the original -- command-for-commandslide-in compatibility for Crosstalk XVI -- but cleans up the code and addssome powerful features.andM;Mirror III boasts a new, powerful programming language, PRISM, yet stillexecutes Crosstalk and Mirror script files.andP;  It handles communications in thebackground, emulates more than a dozen terminals and is fluent in ninecommunications protocols.andM;In addition, it cleans up all the messy details Crosstalk XVI programmersnever noticed.andM;For instance, it runs its clock properly so your 80386-based computer won'tlaunch you into the future with seconds ticking past at double- andtriple-time rates.andM;Although friendlier and more powerful packages are available (but not in onebox), Mirror III reflects a happy, low-cost medium that will serve most userswell.andP;  Give SoftKlone a call at (904) 878-8564.andM;Thoughtline: Hack HelperandM;The quickest way to make your mind go numb is to stand in front of anaudience and open your mouth to start a speech.andP;  Preparing ahead doesn'talways help.andP;  Blank paper or a blank screen are proven mind-alteringsubstances that suck inspiration and organization from your head.andM;Thoughtline from Xpercom, of Carrollton, Texas, is designed to help you getorganized.andP;  It asks questions and sometimes uses portions of your responsesto shape further questions.andM;Thoughtline is tightly structured.andP;  It captures your responses and attempts,occasionally successfully, to organize them into an outline.andM;The program offers no probing insight -- you still have to do that yourself-- and it cannot comprehend the words you type.andP;  It merely mechanicallymanipulates phrases.andM;As with any mechanistic process, you can make Thoughtline look stupid.andP;  Itis.andP;  If you take it seriously, however, and it might help you organizeyourself.andM;Version 2.0 boasts business plan writing, easier installation, expaneddocumentation with little increase in content, context-sensitive Help andbetter organized output outlines.andM;With its new price of $129, down from $295, and all those people staring atyou, you might want to give Xpercom a call at (214) 241-3308.andM;CompuStar: Bus AndrogynousandM;The ultimate computer for the indecisive, the CompuStar from Wells American,of West Columbia, S.C., promises to be the first machine convertible betweenthe two IBM bus standards, AT and Micro Channel.andP;  It also enables both busstandards can reside in one machine.andM;Its modular construction means you design your own computer from a fewessential components: a base system priced at $1,195, a microprocessor module($695 for the 20MHz 80286 received for review), memory ($700 per megabyte),disks, and a choice of as many as two bus modules.andP;  There is a $195 modulewith seven 16-bit AT-style expansion slots and a $250 module with five MicroChannel slots (which also requires a $995 Micro Channel adapter that canserve two slot modules).andM;The whole system pops and snaps together so you can readily upgrade (ordowngrade) it in the field.andM;For its thinking power, the CompuStar accepts modular CPU boards, with 20MHzHarris Corp.andP;  80286 and 16MHz or 20MHz 80386 microprocessors currentlyavailable, and a 25MHz 80386 (with 82305 cache controller) in the offing.andO;Drive possibilities include two 3-1/2-inch drive bays, four 5-1/4-inchhalf-height bays in front, and a full-height 5-1/4-inch bay inside.andP;  EnhancedGraphics Adapter and Video Graphics Array and parallel, serial and mouseports are built-in.andM;Construction quality is superb.andP;  In full AT-dress with seven drive bays and13 expansion slots, the CompuStar could be the most versatile and expandablePC.andM;Alas, the ultimate androgynous promise of the CompuStar remains unfulfilled.andO;The oft-delayed Micro Channel module won't be ready until at least April.andM;If this Micro Channel option works, the CompuStar may resolve the bus warswith a compromise.andP;  But hold your fire till you see the white of their flag.andO;You're still just buying a fast AT until the Micro Channel proves itself.andM;Call Wells American at (803) 796-7800.andM;No Hassles with MINDSandM;The MINDS system from Terus Corp., of Broomfield, Colo., promises hypertext,but lacks one of the hyper-technology's hallmarks.andP;  With MINDS, most of thehassle of linking references and referents is unnecessary.andP;  It isn't quitehypertext, but a half-breed, indexed-ext, search-and-retrieval system.andM;You create a reference file called a context set with MAS, the $129.95 MINDSAuthoring System.andP;  Where normal text-retrieval programs make you wait whilethey look for the right match, MAS does the work ahead of time, making anindex that can later lead you directly to the key words.andP;  The indexingprocess is fast and automatic, but the resulting files take up about threetimes the space as your original text.andM;The $29.95 run-time module is termed MDR, the MINDS Data Retriever.andP;  Usingthe MAS-made index, it zeros in on a block of text containing the key word.andO;The size of the block is defined by the typography of the source file -- aline, sentence or paragraph.andP;  Memory-resident and dial-up versions of MDR areavailable for $49.95.andM;MDR claims to have the intelligence to recognize English search commands, butit actually relies on ignorance.andP;  It simply disregards all but key words.andO;Ask, ''Who is the defendant in the lawsuit?'' and it digs out ''defendant''then searches him out.andM;The MINDS system can be effective.andP;  I was surprised when I tried it with abook manuscript and it took me directly to the answers I wanted.andP;  Give MDR amore business-like interface, and MINDS might just make it.andP;  Call Terus at(303) 469-1700.andM;Tech*Graph*Pad: For EngineersandM;Harvard Graphics for engineers is how Binary Engineering, of Waltham, Mass.,andO;describes its Tech*Graph*Pad.andP;  Designed to deliver the same ease of use ofthe presentation package, Tech*Graph*Pad fills screen and paper with analysisinstead of ostentation -- X-Y plots and fitted curves.andP;  As with HarvardGraphics, anyone should be able to master Tech*Graph*Pad in 15 minutes --even an engineer who can't read the exemplary manual.andM;But Tech*Graph*Pad is no clone.andP;  It has its own look and control system.andO;Instead of dropping down, its menus overlap.andP;  Moving bar selections do mostof the work; function keys are reserved for a few commands.andM;The upgrade of Tech*Graph*Pad from version 2 to version 3 brought addedoptions for importing data and exporting output.andP;  It prints or plots toalmost whatever you have.andP;  Version 3.1 added selectable weight to LaserJetcharacters to dress up the output.andP;  (A free upgrade is available for version3.0 owners.)andM;Good points include power, speed and details: polar charts, linear, semi-logand log scaling, special symbols and the entire Greek alphabet.andP;  On thedownside, it gives only a limited selection of chart types and the on-screenpresentation of graphs is austere.andP;  At $395, it's also relatively expensive.andO;Call Binary Engineering at (617) 290-5900.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
