Fully oxygenated samples were prepared. Theoxygen stoichiometry was reduced by heat treatment at 500{degre}C for22 hours in an O{sub 2}/Ar mixture containing various amounts of O{sub2} flowing over the sample. Samples were then quenched in liquid nitrogento prevent any change in the oxygen stoichiometry upon cooling. The oxygencontent of the samples was determined by weighing. Superconducting transitiontemperatures were determined by magnetic shielding measurements in alow field SQUID magnetometer in fields of 2 Gauss. The measurements werecarried out by cooling the sample to 4.2 K in zero field, applying themeasuring field and taking data on warming. Resistivity measurementswere made by the four probe ac technique at frequency of 100 Hz and witha measuring current of 1.5mA. 2 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
