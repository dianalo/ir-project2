Individuals familiar with the investigation said it will focus on the Los Angeles-based defense contractor's secret arrangement to funnel as much as $55 million to Park Chong Kyu, a now-deceased official of the Seoul Olympics committee who had connections at the highest echelons of the Korean government. Mr. Park's relationship to Northrop was the subject of a recent front-page story in this newspaper.    Investigators will attempt to determine whether Northrop's foreign payments violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law that prohibits payments by American companies directly or indirectly to foreign government officials.    If Northrop were to be found in violation of the law, the company and its chairman, Thomas V. Jones, might also be found in contempt of a consent decree signed by both with the Securities and Exchange Commission, individuals familiar with the investigation said.    Mr. Jones and the company signed the 1975 consent decree, agreeing to refrain from securities-law violations, in connection with about $30 million in questionable foreign payments made to governments and consultants around the world. Five years later, a federal district judge expanded the scope of the decree, specifically barring Northrop from violating the corrupt-practices act, which became law in 1977.    A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment on whether the agency also was looking into the Northrop-Korea matter. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been investigating the matter and plans to hold hearings on Northrop's foreign payments soon. In Seoul, the prosecutor's office and a special committee of the National Assembly have begun their own investigations as part of a larger probe of political corruption.    Among his other activities, Mr. Park arranged for Northrop's Mr. Jones to meet with then-President Park Chun Hee. Earlier this week in Seoul, a spokesman for Mr. Chun denied allegations that the former president solicited or received any payments from Northrop or its lobbyist.    A Northrop spokesman said Mr. Jones couldn't comment on the investigation because of pending litigation in Korea. Northrop has sued to recover from Mr. Park's widow, sons and other relatives and associates $6,250,000 deposited in a Hong Kong bank in 1984.    In its suit and in an arbitration case also pending in Seoul, Northrop has claimed the Hong Kong deposit was meant to help finance building of a hotel in Korea to demonstrate to the government Northrop's interest in investing in the Korean economy. Mr. Park's associates have maintained, however, that the money was spent to &quot;promote&quot; the F-20 jet fighter to Korean officials.    In addition to the Hong Kong payment, Northrop officials signed a contract agreeing to pay as much as $55 million to a company controlled by Mr. Park if the lobbyist was successful in persuading Korean officials to buy 200 aircraft.    Northrop and Mr. Park believed such an order was imminent in mid-1984, but two of the aircraft subsequently crashed and Korean military officials soured on the plane. After investing $1.15 billion in the program and booking just four firm orders, Northrop canceled the F-20 in 1986.    At the time the $55 million commission was promised, it was questioned by several of Northrop's own attorneys and executives who believed the amount was excessive in relationship to the costs of legitimate lobbying activities. Since the foreign-payoff scandals of the 1970s, most U.S. companies have scaled down their payments to foreign consultants and tightened their audit procedures to avoid any appearance of &quot;slush&quot; funds that could be used for illegal payoffs.    Northrop's board began investigating the company's Korean dealings at about the time company officials paid $1.5 million to Mr. Park's lobbying concern in 1986. Since the investigation began, four Northrop executives involved in the affair, including the company's chief financial officer, who authorized the payment, have left the company.    As part of its Korean litigation, Northrop has been allowed by the Seoul court to place liens on various properties owned by Mr. Park's family members and associates, including two pieces of property owned by the late lobbyist's family.    A Northrop spokesman said its litigation is also focusing on a former company consultant in Hawaii, James K. Shin, who was on the Northrop payroll at the same time that he had a separate, secret arrangement with Mr. Park to receive 25% of the $55 million. &quot;We're looking into how Mr. Shin may have benefited&quot; from the company's Korean dealings, the Northrop spokesman said. Mr. Shin didn't return messages left with family members at his home in Honolulu.    Mr. Shin, who was born in Korea, introduced Mr. Park to Northrop officials. Although Northrop and congressional investigators have been unable to determine whether the two had a prior partnership, they may have met because both were in the nightclub business.    Mr. Park's Safari Club was a private Seoul meeting place for government officials, arms dealers and Korean call girls. Mr. Shin's The Palace in Honolulu attracted a clientele considerably down the social ladder. Both establishments have since closed. </TEXT></DOC>
