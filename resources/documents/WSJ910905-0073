The document shows that in the year ended last Feb. 23,ShopKo accounted for 13.1% of Super Valu's $11.6 billion insales but nearly 30% of its $155.1 million in earnings. On apro forma basis ShopKo earned $45.9 million, or $1.44 ashare, on sales of $1.5 billion.</LP><TEXT>   In ShopKo's fiscal first quarter ended this past June 15,pro forma sales of $455.8 million were up 9.7% while earningsrose 38.4% to $10.8 million.   But the prospectus cautions would-be investors thatquarterly earnings for the last half won't compare asfavorably as those of the first quarter. It cites &quot;increasedcompetitive pressures&quot; plus unusual vendor allowances thatwere accounted for in the last quarter of fiscal 1991.   In the third quarter ended last Dec. 1, ShopKo had pretaxearnings of $23 million and in the fourth quarter ended lastFeb. 23, pretax earnings totaled $33.9 million.   Super Valu, a large food wholesaler based in suburbanMinneapolis, would retain between 41% and 48% ownership inthe discount retailing operation after the offering, proceedsof which would repay loans made to ShopKo.   ShopKo's preliminary filing with the Securities andExchange Commission also says the retailer intends to pay aninitial quarterly dividend of 11 cents, which would comparewith Super Valu's current 16.5 cents quarterly payout.   ShopKo now operates 108 stores in 13 states, from Michiganto California, primarily in smaller cities and towns. Thecompany's preliminary offering prospectus says that while itintends to open two more stores this fiscal year, additionswill slow next fiscal year as it spends $36 million to expandits distribution centers.   The document's pro forma balance sheet as of this pastJune 15 shows ShopKo with $17.8 million in receivables, $247million in inventories and $705 million in total assets.Accounts payable total $158.4 million, current liabilitieswere $217.2 million and long-term debt was $192.2 million,giving ShopKo a total capitalization of $476.4 million.   ShopKo shares would trade on the New York Stock Exchangeunder the symbol SKO.</TEXT></DOC>
