In response to the court decision and other rulings byMichigan regulators this week, Moody's Investors Service Inc.said it is reviewing for a possible upgrade the ratings on$2.2 billion of debt held by CMS Energy's Consumers Power Co.unit.</LP><TEXT>   Moody's officials said the court and regulatory actionsclarified important financial issues hanging over CMS.   In its ruling yesterday, the Michigan Court of Appealsordered state regulators to reconsider the rate thatConsumers Power pays for electricity it purchases from theMidland, Mich., Midland Cogeneration Venture. Consumers Powerholds a 49% stake in the venture. Six other companies own theremaining 51%. Cogeneration is the process of generating twouseful energy forms, usually electricity and heat, from thesame fuel source.   State regulators had set the rate at 3.77 cents a kilowatthour, but Consumers Power officials are seeking 4.15 cents akilowatt hour. The higher rate could allow Consumers Power toget an additional $365 million in bonds for its stake in theventure. Consumers Power initially received $1.2 billion innotes and the 49% stake in return for its investment in theventure.   The court also ruled that Consumers Power could buy asmuch as 1,104 megawatts of electric power from thecogeneration venture. Michigan regulators had limited thecompany's purchases from the venture to 840 megawatts.   Separately, Michigan regulators ruled Tuesday thatConsumers Power could recoup only $760 million of its $4.1billion investment in a failed nuclear plant at Midland. Thatforced the utility to announce that it will take an after-taxwrite-off of $285 million this year. Consumers Power hadaccounted for all but $1.3 billion of its Midland investment.</TEXT></DOC>
