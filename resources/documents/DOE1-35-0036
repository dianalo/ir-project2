The work, conducted in 1986,is focused on the review of basic techniques for amorphous solar cellsto determine the limits of them. The items covered by the review includethe progress in film production techniques and process techniques; newinformation on properties of amorphous silicon materials; improvementin properties of amorphous silicon alloy films; enhancement of qualityof transparent conductive films; new techniques for increasing the efficiency;2- and 4- terminal stacked cells; key techniques for long-term stableoperation; light deterioration in amorphous silicon solar cells; andtechniques for its control. It is stressed that future research and developmentwork should include a study on light deterioration to ensure high stabilityand development of techniques for producing elements to be incorporatedin devices required for high-efficiency tandem solar cells.</TEXT></DOC>
