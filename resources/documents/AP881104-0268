Dukakis, who supports a federal seven-day waiting period onhandgun purchases and a ban on ``Saturday Night Specials,'' accusedhis opponent of distorting his stance on gun control.   ``I've always supported the right of hunters and sportsmen to ownweapons and (for) people to protect themselves in their own homes,''the Democrat said.   Dukakis backed the so-called Brady amendment to impose a uniform,mandatory seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases in allstates. Bush opposed the Brady amendment, which went down to a228-182 defeat Sept. 13 after intense lobbying by the NRA.   Bush, a lifetime member of the NRA, elicited cheers from crowdsacross the South and West whenever he declared his opposition to newfederal gun controls.   ``I'm a sportsman, I'm a hunter, (I) like to do it, and I don'tbelieve we need the federal government going forward with guncontrol legislation,'' Bush told a rally in Billings, Mont.   In opposing a federal waiting period, Bush found himself on theopposite side of several national police organizations, worriedabout the vagaries of state laws. Only 22 states now bar instant gunpurchases.   Dukakis vehemently denied ever telling a gun owners' lobbyist,``I don't believe in people owning guns, only the police andmilitary. And I am going to do everything I can to disarm thisstate.''   In 1976, Dukakis supported a Massachusetts referendum to banprivate ownership of handguns. The referendum failed.   Dukakis currently favors the ban on Saturday Night Specials, aswell as ``additional efforts to keep guns out of the hands of thecriminally or mentally dangerous, including background checks.''   Dukakis boasts that as governor he supported a law setting amandatory one-year prison sentence for those illegally carrying agun, and stiffened penalties for felonies commited with a firearm.He says 22,000 Americans are killed each year with handguns.   At one point the Dukakis campaign threatened a lawsuit againstthe NRA over ads berating the Democrat's record on guns and crime.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, long a favorite of the NRA, came tothe defense of his running mate, saying, ``I saw those ads aboutMike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you. I sure wouldn'tbe running with any fellow if I thought he was going to take myshotgun away from me.''   Bush said he supports ``mandatory sentences for those caughtusing a gun during a crime.'' But in a letter to the NRA, theRepublican attacked what he called the ``gun control myths.''   ``Those who invent these myths threaten more than the rights ofour 70 million gun owners and 25 million hunters,'' Bush said.``Federal licensing, gun registration, background checks, or a banon firearms to name a few, would only restrict the rights of thelaw-abiding, leaving criminals free to commit crimes with illegalweapons.''   Dukakis told a crowd in Pueblo, Colo., that the charges he isagainst gun ownership are ``a lot of baloney.''   ``What I'm concerned about is teen-agers in major cities of thiscountry running around with Uzis and AK-47s (automatic militaryweapons) and killing people'' in street gangs and drug deals,Dukakis said. ``That's the kind of thing that's got to becontrolled, not innocent sportsmen who have a perfect right tohunt.''   Bush, as a congressman from Houston, voted for the originalfederal Gun Control Act of 1968. That law, enacted after theassassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., barred convictedfelons from buying or owning guns and banned interstate andmail-order sale of handguns.   But Bush says he also supported the 1986 McClure-Volkmer Act thatallowed the interstate sale of rifles and shotguns.   Bush, in his campaign literature, says, ``I have always opposedfederal gun registration or licensing of gun owners.'' But he added,``We must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with therights of society. ... We must do all we can to keep guns out of thehands of convicted criminals.''   In a debate with other Republican candidates before the GunOwners of New Hampshire last Feb. 2, Bush said, ``I'm not only ahunter but I'm a lifetime member of the NRA. I do have a deepappreciation for the Second Amendment rights'' to keep and bear arms.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance</NOTE></DOC>
