An East German man taking part in the exodus to West Germanydrowned while swimming across the Danube River from Czechoslovakiato Hungary, refugee workers said Monday. He was forced to swimbecause he had no travel documents.   A Czechoslovak man on Monday managed to cross his Communisthomeland's border to West Germany on a homemade motorized hangglider.   The most direct route for East Germans seeking to take advantageof Hungary's free passage to Austria is through Czechoslovakia,between East Germany and Hungary.   The 750 new refugees who arrived in Bavaria early Monday bringsthe total to more than 16,000 that have arrived since Hungary openedits border to the West one week ago. After leaving Hungary, therefugees cross Austria and enter West Germany, where they receiveautomatic citizenship and help settling.   Hungary, which also has adopted economic and political reforms,has come under attack from hard-line East bloc allies for allowingthe exodus of East Germans. But Western politicians have welcomedthe moves.   Western officials on Monday pledged support for Hungary.   The Commerce Department announced that the United States andHungary will open negotiations on an agreement to give the Communistcountry permanent most-favored nation trade status and other tradeand investment opportunities.   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said in Budapest that theproposals are part of a ``comprehensive business and economicagreement'' that includes a $25 million fund to help create privatebusiness.   At a separate news conference, Frans Andriessen, a top foreignaffairs official of the 12-member European Economic Community, saidhe had pledged to do ``all that's possible'' to support Hungaryeconomically.   East German refugees arriving in Budapest reported East Germanand Czechoslovak authorities were trying to prevent many fromcrossing into Hungary if they were suspected of wanting to emigrateto the West.   Wolfgang Warner, the head of the West German charity organizationhelping East Germans, said Monday that it was clear that Prague andEast Berlin were working ``hand in hand'' to stem the flow of EastGermans using Hungary's open door to the West.   Wagner said the East German man who drowned Sunday in the Danubetried to escape because he did not have travel permits for Hungary.   The total number of East Germans who have used Hungary forpassage to freedom since early summer is thought to exceed 25,000.Many fled illegally after Hungary removed some border fortificationswith Austria in May.   The number of East Germans taking refuge in the West GermanEmbassy in Warsaw, Poland, swelled over the weekend to 110, WestGerman Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog told reporters inBonn. ``The situation is untenable,'' Chrobog said. ``It cannot goon like this.''   Wladyslaw Klaczynski, a spokesman in the Polish Foreign Ministry,said he had no information Monday on the situation.</TEXT></DOC>
