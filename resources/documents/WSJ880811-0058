Today, he's the campaign manager for George Bush, one of the most &quot;establishment&quot; presidential candidates in recent history. At the age of 37, Mr. Atwater remains far from the image of upper-class squire. What he brings to the campaign is a genius for manipulation and a knack for knowing what lies beyond the next horizon.    &quot;He is a born schemer, and I don't mean that in a pejorative way,&quot; says Earl Black, a political scientist who has known him since Mr. Atwater was a graduate student here at the University of South Carolina. &quot;He's like a young Lyndon Johnson. He has an ability to see into the future. He knows what will play and not play.&quot;    What plays over the coming months will make all the difference for Mr. Atwater and his candidate. Republicans must regain lost momentum in next week's convention; but more than at any other time in his political life, Mr. Atwater appears to be going against the grain.    A self-described libertarian, his career has coincided with the rise of Ronald Reagan, but he now faces a public that indicates it wants a change from the president's policies. A master of negative campaigning, he must help manage a candidate who is himself burdened with high negative ratings in the polls.    Mr. Atwater's record of controversy makes him a target as well in this often mean-spirited contest. After years spent psyching his opponents into believing he is behind every bump in the night, &quot;Dr. Negative&quot; risks becoming a negative himself. &quot;He is developing a reputation as a political hit man,&quot; says Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis's adviser Kirk O'Donnell, who has sparred with Mr. Atwater.    Treasury Secretary James Baker's long-planned appointment as Bush campaign chairman will lower Mr. Atwater's high public profile. The two men have a working relationship that goes back to Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign.    Mr. Atwater's attention will be on organization and daily operations. His critics and some supporters say this plays to his strength as a tactician rather than a broad strategist.    As a tactician with a specific opponent to run against, Mr. Atwater showed his strength early this year by helping hold the Bush campaign together after the candidate was trounced in the Iowa GOP caucuses. But when opposition to Mr. Bush collapsed after the Super Tuesday primaries in March, the vice president drifted for months in a campaign that critics say reflected Mr. Atwater's own narrow understanding of policy issues.    When Mr. Atwater began firing on the Democrats in June -- just as he had done in the New Hampshire primary against Sen. Robert Dole -- his methods were effective but largely negative. Republican analyst Kevin Phillips describes his tactics as a &quot;little attack-dog approach.&quot;    Mr. Atwater's methods reflect his emphasis on what he calls the &quot;geopolitics&quot; of the Electoral College rather than on broad demographic groups. By his calculations, the decision in November will depend on the votes of conservative Democrats in a half-dozen states, and much of the fight is for control of what these voters will see when they focus on the election in the final days of the campaign.    After eight years of GOP rule, Mr. Atwater says, &quot;We're on the dead-wrong end of the historic cycle. If voters don't see a difference, they'll go back to being Democrats.&quot;    Mr. Atwater's academic background is in media and political science, but his instincts are honed most by a curiosity about history and popular culture. In a high-technology world, he believes voters look for more warmth from their candidates, and this student of perceptions sometimes seems to refashion his own Southern Republican &quot;baby-boomer&quot; life to fit the themes he wants to project.    &quot;I was always an anti-establishment guy,&quot; Mr. Atwater says, and he casts himself as a populist figure able to break out of the white middle-class mold of many Republicans.    &quot;I was with (singer) Percy Sledge. I was the only white guy there,&quot; he was quoted as saying in a 1985 Washington Post interview. &quot;I was really in the Southern soul movement.&quot; In reality, Mr. Atwater -- while a skilled musician with a genuine knowledge of black rhythm and blues -- grew up on a street out of &quot;Leave It to Beaver,&quot; and his musical ventures were geared more often to fraternities and white clubs.    In part, the image Mr. Atwater cultivates is a Southerner's defense against the perceived snobbery of Washington. In part, friends suggest, it is also his own rebellion against the strictures of his party and current position. &quot;He's a lot more thoughtful than a lot of people give him credit for,&quot; says Bill Carrick, a Democrat who has watched Mr. Atwater since their days together in South Carolina.    John Carbaugh, who introduced Mr. Atwater to organized politics, was a conservative activist who built up GOP support on campuses across South Carolina in the 1968 presidential campaign. By the time Mr. Atwater became active in the 1970s, being a Republican offered a path to power.    &quot;He knew where he wanted to go,&quot; says Robert Carley, a political scientist and adviser to Mr. Atwater during his undergraduate days at Newberry (S.C.) College. The effort was linked closely with promoting Sen. Strom Thurmond, an early mentor, and Richard Nixon, and by chance it became the vehicle through which Mr. Atwater came to know another unlikely insurgent, George Bush.    Mr. Atwater's pattern of relationships with powerful older men is balanced by his mystique among younger followers. Friends inevitably speak of his loyalty, and he has helped to move allies into positions in government and the network of campaign and media organizations.    Chief among these is Campaign Consultants, an offshoot of the powerful Washington lobbying firm of Black, Manafort, Stone andamp; Kelly. As a partner in Campaign Consultants, Mr. Atwater has the use of a black Mercedes, and the firm estimates it has paid him $30,000 from his share of earnings while at the Bush campaign.    A second firm, Baker andamp; Associates, was his earliest base for campaign consulting in the 1970s. Its name was chosen in part to hide his own. This penchant for covert maneuvering is an Atwater trademark; he has been accused at various times of such tactics as fostering third candidates to help his clients.    One man who felt the brunt of Mr. Atwater's tactics is liberal Thomas Turnipseed, whose bid for Congress was effectively destroyed when Mr. Atwater surreptitiously revived a three-year-old story about the Democrat's psychiatric treatment for depression as a young man.    Mr. Turnipseed and his then-campaign manager, Jimmy Goff, say their support in that South Carolina contest was further eroded when white conservatives in selected precincts received phone calls in a &quot;poll&quot; asking whether it would affect their view of Mr. Turnipseed to learn that he was a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.    Mr. Atwater says he regrets having raised the issue of the Democrat's psychiatric treatment, but he and others on the Republican side deny any knowledge of a poll designed to stir racial divisions.    Although Republicans in the South depend heavily on maximizing the white turnout to counter blacks' loyalty to the Democrats, Mr. Atwater insists that the Republican Party's future will depend on getting a &quot;chunk of minority voters&quot; for itself. &quot;After this election,&quot; he says, &quot;that will be a No. 1 priority.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
