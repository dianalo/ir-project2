The experiment, launched over White Sands Missile Range in NewMexico on Thursday, tested how a neutral particle beam acceleratorwould work in space. It was the first time such a beam of atomicparticles was fired into the heavens.   The test known as BEAR _ or Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket _ wasconsidered a primary step in Pentagon's research into the lasers,beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons which would bedesigned to shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the United Statesor its allies.   The Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formallycalled, would make use of particle beams as a potential anti-missileweapon. A beam would determine whether an object is a decoy or anenemy warhead, and could be used to disable a missile.   Last week's experiment involved lifting into space _ just for afew minutes _ a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Airesrocket. Before the rocket returned to Earth, the accelerator wasturned on and scientists collected data on how it worked and how theparticle beams moved.   At a news conference Monday, the experiment's managers declaredthe test a success, displaying a fuzzy black and white video tape ofthe bright, pulsing beam as it emerged from the rocket.   Air Force Col. Thomas Meyer, head of the SDI organization'soffice of directed energy, said the experiment showed that thecomplex equipment needed to produce the beam could be made in acompact way, survive being shot into space, and function well.   ``It is a major achievement, both in technology andengineering,'' Meyer said.   He said the experiment ``demonstrates the promise (of SDI) thatwe have talked about all along.''   In the laboratory, the equipment used for ground experiments ofthe system would fill an average-size house, while the payloadaboard the rocket was about 24 feet in length and 3{ feet indiameter.   The director said the program's designers and scientists alsowanted to test how the beam acted in space and how space affected it.   ``All ... experiment objectives were succesfully achieved,'' hesaid.   Meyer, asked how long it will take before the system could becomea full-fledged weapon in space, indicated that budget cuts are moreof a problem than technical difficulties.   ``The real issue is, what is the funding for SDI?'' Meyer said.``It's difficult for me to tell you when we'll have a weapon inspace without a clear definition of what our future funding is. Andit's continuing to be up in the air.''   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House ArmedServices Committee, said a number of programs ``have yet to go interms of proving and particle beams is one.''   ``I have not seen the briefing; my reaction is skepticism to saythat it's all fixed,'' he added.   Meyer called the elements of last week's experiment``on-the-shelf hardware,'' but that some engineering problems stillneed to be worked out.   ``It only takes the money to put it together ... and that's whenwe'll get the weapon,'' he said.   Army Lt. Col. Warren Higgins, a former manager of the BEARprogram also at the briefing, disputed the notion that the testswere in conflict with the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.   Critics of the Star Wars program say the treaty puts severelimits on testing and deployment of a space-based defense.   ``We have a non-lethal beam, we had no target,'' Higgins said,adding that the experiments have been cleared as``treaty-compliant.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has battled congressional budgetcuts in the space-based anti-missile defense.   The House Armed Services Committee has approved a $3.5 billionbudget for SDI, compared with the $4.6 billion President Bushproposed. The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced theadministration's request to $4.5 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
