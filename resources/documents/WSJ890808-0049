Amgen Inc. and Genetics Institute Inc. both charge, among other things, that the other's patent for the anti-anemia drug, EPO, is invalid. Genetics Institute's partner, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo, is also a party in the complex litigation.    &quot;The trial is being watched intensely by people in the industry for broad implications,&quot; said Lisa Raines, director of government relations at the Industrial Biotechnology Association in Washington. Most biotech patent disputes are settled before they reach trial.    &quot;Companies have found it more convenient to simply cross-license (patent rights) rather than slug it out in litigation,&quot; Ms. Raines said. If Amgen loses, she thinks other biotech companies could be discouraged from efforts to press their patent claims in court.    Many securities analysts plan to be in the courtroom this morning to hear the opening arguments because of the high stakes involved. While sales forecasts for EPO vary wildly, analysts expect the drug to garner annual sales of $100 million to more than $1 billion.    &quot;This is the big (trial). The one for all the marbles. There will be a winner and there will be a loser,&quot; Stuart Weisbrod at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. told clients in brief written remarks yesterday. But Amgen has more to lose than Genetics Institute or Chugai, Mr. Weisbrod and other analysts agree.    Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., has hired a sales force and is building a full-fledged drug company around EPO, its first commercial product. Amgen's version of the drug, sold under the Epogen trademark, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on June 1 for treatment of anemia in patients suffering from chronic kidney failure.    Genetics Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and Chugai have licensed U.S. marketing rights to Chugai-Upjohn Inc., a joint venture of Chugai and Upjohn Co., the giant U.S. drug company based in Kalamazoo, Mich. Chugai-Upjohn, based in Rosemont, Ill., is awaiting FDA approval for Marogen, its version of the drug.    Amgen runs the risk of losing all rights to EPO, whereas the worst Genetics Institute can do is &quot;lose partially,&quot; said Robert Kupor, an analyst at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. If Amgen's patent is upheld, Genetics Institute won't be able to manufacture EPO in the U.S., but the company will be able to receive royalties from Chugai-Upjohn on domestic sales of imported Marogen, he says.    Federal Judge William Young, who has ruled on most pretrial motions since Amgen fired the first legal volley in the patent litigation in October 1987, is tied up with a criminal case outside of Boston. To accelerate the patent trial, the parties agreed in February for the case to be heard by Magistrate Patti B. Saris.    Magistrate Saris, a Harvard Law School graduate, was an assistant U.S. attorney in Boston and chief of the civil division before she was named a U.S. magistrate in 1986. This will be the first patent trial over which she has presided, although she has been involved in preliminary hearings and other procedural matters involving patent disputes, according to her law clerk.    The trial is expected to take six to eight weeks, a Genetics Institute spokesman said. &quot;We look for a decision at the end of November at the earliest.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
