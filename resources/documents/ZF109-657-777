(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Erica SchroederandM;Douglas Bailey, development manager for Charter Networks Inc., a softwaredevelopment firm in Eagan, Minn., looked at seven optical characterrecognition (OCR) software products before settling on Calera RecognitionSystems Inc.'s WordScan Plus.andM;&quot;WordScan Plus was the only one that worked reliably,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We triedout a number of packages, and Calera had the highest recognition rate for thetype of material we scan.andM;&quot;With the material we work with, the number of errors I have to deal with areon the average under two to three a page.andP;  And the user interface is the bestwe tried,&quot; he added.andM;Bailey looked at Hewlett-Packard Co.'s (HP's) AccuScan, and found that it hada good user interface, but was not as accurate in handling low-qualityimagery, he added.andM;&quot;We use a fax board, so the fax winds up on disk and the image quality is notgood.andP;  Calera did at least twice as well as AccuScan [in accuracy],&quot; he said.andM;The fact that the product runs under Windows was important because &quot;all thescanner-management software we use runs under Windows 3.0,&quot; he said.andM;He also found the product easy to learn.andP;  &quot;Five minutes after it was out ofthe box, it was doing useful work.andP;  I didn't open the manual until after I'dhad it for two months,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;It's one of the few pieces of software we bought that we haven't wanted tostrangle someone over,&quot; he added.andM;However, Bailey's Epson America Inc.andP;  ES-300C scanner is not directlysupported by the software.andP;  To solve that problem, Bailey first scans adocument, then imports the resulting files into WordScan Plus, which he usesmainly for scanning incoming faxes and typewritten data sheets.andM;WordScan Plus also provides pop-up error messages and &quot;shows the block ofgraphics the scanner saw when it hit something it couldn't recognize,&quot; heexplained.andM;Some of the WordScan features Bailey likes are its ability to learn oddfonts, its dictionary and its deferred processing feature.andM;Speed is also one of the package's best assets, Bailey said.andP;  &quot;It's fasterthan they advertise itt runs at 550 words a minute, and they advertise it at400,&quot; he said.andM;Bailey uses an in-house package for graphics file editing, although WordScanPlus would work well for that with the appropriate template, he said.andM;Larry Talley, senior staff chemist for Exxon Research and Engineering Co., adivision of Exxon Corp., in Baytown, Texas, went shopping for OCR softwareand decided that the combination of AccuScan and Windows 3.0 was the bestchoice.andM;Using Windows makes the spectrum of options available with AccuScan moremanageable, he explained.andM;Talley runs AccuScan on an Armasfull IBM-compatible 33MHz 386 PC with 8Mbytes of RAM and an HP ScanJet.andM;&quot;I looked at hand scanners and decided I didn't want [one],&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Ijust wanted to be able to put a document down and have it scan the wholepage.andP;  [The ScanJet has] the advantage that the file it produced would becompatible with many different applications.&quot;andM;Aside from using Accuscan to scan in old typed documents to avoid tediousrekeying, Talley uses the product to incorporate graphical data into reports.andM;&quot;We have a lot of analytical data, and we like to reduce those andincorporate those into a word-processing document.andP;  Rather than reducing andthen cutting and pasting it on a Xerox, [using AccuScan is] more reliable,&quot;Talley said.andM;To produce a company newsletter, Talley previously gathered graphics and textfrom several sources and assembled the document by hand.andM;&quot;With AccuScan, they give me a diskette and I can do everything on thecomputer, and I don't have to cut and paste anymore,&quot; he said.andM;AccuScan identifies regions as text or graphics to facilitate this process,according to Talley.andM;Another advantage of using the HP package is the high level of compatibilitybetween the HP ScanJet and LaserJet II printer.andM;&quot;It goes directly from scanner to printer, and you can preview things on theprinter, rather than going through the computer, &quot; said Talley.andM;Although the AccuScan software does not have a built-in text editor, Talleycircumvents this problem by using WordPerfect as an editor.andM;Dalton Ruer, programmer analyst for NCR Corp. in Dayton, Ohio, used OcronInc.'s ReadPro under Windows 2.0.andP;  He chose to upgrade to Ocron's Perceive1.0 when his department moved to Windows 3.0.andM;&quot;We wanted to run [Ocron's] old package in [Windows 3.0] real mode, but thatdidn't work, and Perceive was easy to install and to learn,&quot; he said.andM;Meets Great ExpectationsandM;&quot;Perceive exceeded any expectations I had, especially for user friendliness.andO;We have a lot of people in our department who are not computer-literate, andit makes my life a lot easier,&quot; he said.andM;Ruer's department runs Perceive on NCR 386-based machines with HP ScanJetscanners.andM;Perceive's ability to &quot;learn&quot; typefaces is helpful to Ruer.andM;&quot;It is probably over 99 percent accurate, which is very helpful when you'rescanning a document, so you don't have to keep giving it letters,&quot; heexplained.andM;&quot;You can see the actual text at the same time to be able to verify what theletter should be.andP;  As it's learning, it shows you the graphic image you wantit to give to the letter, which is very effective,&quot; said Ruer.andM;Ruer's department scans text-only or graphics-only documents separately toavoid problems dealing with both.andM;&quot;We don't do both, because you would have to keep it in graphics mode, andthen you couldn't edit text,&quot; he said.andP;  However, Ruer gives the product highmarks for its ability to edit graphics as well as text.andM;The only problem he has run into is clumsiness when switching between filesin learn-text mode.andP;  &quot;It seems like the ability to change the file you'resaving when you're learning the text could be a little easier,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
