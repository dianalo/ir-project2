But several economists and investment strategists expect Fed officials to raise short-term interest rates slightly further within a few months.    &quot;There shouldn't be any change in policy&quot; at this week's meeting, said Robert T. McGee, a financial economist at Irving Trust Co. &quot;We've had some evidence the economy is slowing down, so there's no reason to tighten -- and there's uncertainty about whether the slowdown is going to last, so there's no reason to ease.&quot;    Still, the economy &quot;isn't going to slow down enough to keep the Fed from having to tighten further&quot; late this year, Mr. McGee contended. He predicted that banks will raise their prime, or base rate, half a percentage rate to 10 1/2% before the year ends.    For now, though, Fed officials face little or no pressure to change policy.    Several recent government reports, especially employment data released Sept. 2, indicated that the economy moved to a slightly slower growth track last month. Those figures, coupled with other factors such as the dollar's recent strength and declines in the price of gold, have helped ease inflation fears.    &quot;My reading is that they (Fed officials) are reasonably happy with the way things stand now,&quot; said Stephen Slifer, economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    Norman Robertson, senior vice president and chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, agreed. &quot;I would think the Fed will be very content to hold policy on an even keel,&quot; he said. &quot;Certainly the recent batch of economic reports virtually eliminates the need for any further tightening before Election Day.&quot;    Still, further increases in short-term interest rates appear likely late this year, according to Mr. Robertson. &quot;I would look for the federal funds rate to be at least 8 1/4% or slightly higher by the end of the year,&quot; he said. The rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, has averaged about 8 1/8% recently.    While no credit policy changes may come this week, many analysts insist the risks of higher inflation outweigh the possibility of a recession any time soon. Several, including Mr. Slifer, said the Fed committee this week may even authorize additional credit-tightening moves that could be implemented speedily if economic growth accelerates and inflation pressures mount.    Mr. Slifer said the economy's growth rate probably hasn't slowed enough to fall within the Fed's preference of 2% to 2 1/2%. He thinks the economy is expanding at a 3.3% annual clip this quarter, about the same as in the first half of the year.    Fed policy probably will be influenced heavily by September employment statistics that will be released by the Labor Department Oct. 7. Earlier this year, strong employment gains persuaded Fed officials to tighten their credit vise several notches. Lately, those moves seem to be working.    Moreover, money supply growth stands comfortably within the Fed's target ranges. Analysts say that further strengthens the case for leaving credit policy unchanged.    Thomas C. Melzer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, wants the Fed to modify its approach to setting policy. In a recent speech, he urged the Fed to adopt limits on the quarterly growth of a measure known as the &quot;monetary base.&quot;    Controlling the base, which consists of reserves of depository institutions plus currency held by the public, is considered by some economists to be the best way to promote long-term stability in inflation and economic growth. A Senate Banking Committee report recently called on the Federal Reserve Board to study the advisability of setting a target range for the base.    Mr. Melzer suggested setting broad quarterly annual growth targets of 5% to 9% in base growth. In his Sept. 6 speech, he argued that the base can be controlled by the Fed &quot;with relative precision,&quot; and that constraint would help reduce economic volatility. The subject came up earlier this year at the Fed, but most officials at the time decided not to set a target.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Bond prices were little changed to slightly lower in lackluster activity.    Prices of long-term Treasury bonds finished with very small declines. The latest 30-year bonds were quoted late in the day at 101 6/32, down 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield rose to 9.01% from 9%.    The latest 10-year Treasury notes fell to 102 3/32 from 102 7/32. The yield rose to 8.93% from 8.90%. The yield on two-year notes rose to 8.38% from 8.37%. And the yield on the government's 9% notes due November 1993 rose to 8.65% from 8.64%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton's index of long-term Treasury bonds slipped 2.20 points to 1242.15. The high was 1244.17, while the low was 1239.74. A week earlier, the index stood about four points higher.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell slightly. The latest three-month bills were quoted late Friday at 7.15% bid, down from 7.18% Thursday, while six-month bills were quoted at 7.37% bid, down from 7.38%. </TEXT></DOC>
