Mapsand discussions of 16 galaxies are given together with observed and derivedradio properties of the complete sample of 37 galaxies. The radial distributionsof non-thermal emission in six face-on galaxies are derived. Of these,NGC 1313, 1566, 1672 and M83 have exponential dependences similar tothose of the associated blue light distributions. Scale lengths of thenon-thermal emission are used to derive limiting values for the magneticfield and relativistic electron scale lengths.</TEXT></DOC>
