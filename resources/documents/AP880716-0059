(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   National Guardsmen today patrolled CouncilBluffs, Iowa, after tornadoes ripped through two Missouri Rivercommunities, injuring at least 64 people, damaging more than 100homes and flipping railroad cars.   ``It's an absolute miracle no one is dead,'' Council Bluffs CityCouncilman Stanley Grote said Friday after thunderstorms packingtornadoes and wind gusts up to 92 mph slammed into Omaha and itsneighbor across the river.   Trees up to 48 inches in diameter snapped in Council Bluffs andothers as tall as 100 feet were uprooted at an Omaha golf course.The twisters also downed power lines, started fires and overturnedrail cars in a two-mile stretch in Council Bluffs.   Omaha Public Power District and Iowa Power and Light said anestimated 100,000 residences were without power. Authorities saidcrews worked through the night and ``still had a long way to go''before restoring all power.   Council Bluffs Mayor Tom Hanafan ordered an overnight curfew toforestall looting and Guardsmen patrolled the streets.   More than 2 inches of rain caused street flooding in parts ofOmaha and hail was reported throughout the area.   In the worst two-mile stretch in Council Bluffs, the tops ofhundreds of trees were sawed off by a twister, sidewalks wereuplifted and roofs were blown off houses.   There were at least three sightings of tornadoes in the areaFriday afternoon, the National Weather Service said today.   An Omaha man was in serious condition today with neck andpossible internal injuries after a tree fell on a car he was in.Another man in the car was in fair condition. Most injuries wereminor, officials at three hospitals said.   Lightning and high winds knocked at least one radio station offthe air, and the Council Bluffs Nonpareil was forced to use OmahaWorld-Herald presses to put out its Saturday edition because of thepower outage in Council Bluffs.   Exits off Interstate 29 into Council Bluffs were closed lateFriday and the Iowa Highway patrol sealed off the most heavilydamaged area.   ``We went to the hallway and we were praying very hard.Emphasize that we were praying real, real hard,'' said CouncilBluffs resident Lu Guzenhauser, who was baby sitting when the stormhit her westside neighborhood.   Ms. Guzenhauser and the two children escaped injury even thoughpart of the tool shed behind her house was hanging from power linesin the front of her home after the storm. Five blocks away twohouses were destroyed.   Bonnie Nusser was upstairs with her three children when thetornado hit their Council Bluffs home.   Thirty seconds later, the house was destroyed, but the familywas safe under a pile of rubble in the backyard.   ``We were in the hallway upstairs and the house just startedsliding. I just grabbed for the kids and held on,'' she said. ``Ihad two of them with me so the thing I was thinking was `Where'sthe third?'   ``We landed outside in the backyard under a pile of rubble. Myson was under that pile of rubble where the stairs were,'' shesaid, pointing to where her home used to be. Denny Nusser, 17,suffered a cut arm. No one else in the family was hurt.   ``We found a camera and a tennis racket and a shoe,'' Mrs.Nusser said. ``I think I'm going to build a bomb shelter.''</TEXT></DOC>
