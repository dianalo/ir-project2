In a 352-page filing, Texaco asked the Texas Supreme Court to intercede &quot;not just to undo the cacophony of errors committed in affirming the erroneous judgment against Texaco, but to preserve the integrity and stability of Texas law . . .&quot;    Texaco requested that the state Supreme Court hold a hearing on the huge judgment, which forced Texaco into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing in April. If it agrees to hear the case, the Supreme Court would have wide latitude to uphold the verdict, reduce the damages, or send the case back to a lower court. The court is scheduled to go into summer recess next month, and wouldn't be likely to act on Texaco's request any sooner than September, when it reconvenes.    In its filing, Texaco cited more than 100 points of error that a Texas appellate court allegedly made in February in upholding a state court's initial 1985 ruling that Texaco improperly interfered with a merger agreement between Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co. Among other complaints, Texaco asserted that the appellate court &quot;ran roughshod&quot; over the applicable takeover law applied in the case.    A Pennzoil spokesman declined to comment on the latest Texaco filing.    Texaco called the damage judgment &quot;egregiously unjust,&quot; noting that it exceeds one-half of the entire annual budget of the state of Texas and that interest on the judgment mounts at the rate of $100,000 an hour. The White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant also repeated its earlier arguments that the trial judges in the case misapplied the law and gave misleading instructions to the jury.    As it has in previous stages in the case, Texaco used some of its harshest language to attack the alleged prejudice of the initial trial judge, Anthony Farris, who received a $10,000 campaign contribution from Pennzoil's lead trial attorney, Joe Jamail. Texaco accused the late Judge Farris of displaying prejudice inside the courtroom through unfavorable rulings and of &quot;giving vent to personal spleen&quot; about Texaco in his own correspondence.    The Supreme Court justices who will receive Texaco's brief are themselves familiar with campaign contributions. As previously reported, Pennzoil's lawyers have contributed $190,000 to the three Supreme Court justices who have been elected to the bench since Pennzoil won the initial case. Texaco's lawyers have contributed about $50,000 to the same justices in the same period. </TEXT></DOC>
