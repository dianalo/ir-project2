The Bulgarian Constitution now guarantees the Communists aleading role in society.   ``It's difficult for me to predict in what particular way thisissue will be resolved, but I foresee changes in theconstitution,'' Mladenov said.   He said a constitutional commission of which he is chairman willmake recommendations to Bulgaria's Parliament at the end of themonth.   The Communist parties of some of Bulgaria's East bloc partners,including Czechoslovakia and East Germany, have given up theirconstitutional monopoly on power in the face of popular demands fordemocratic reforms.   Mladenov took over as Communist leader on Nov. 10, ending 35years of rule by Todor Zhivkov.   Mladenov attended the Warsaw Pact meeting held Monday in Moscowand stayed on for talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.He said relations with Moscow were good and should improve.   Bulgaria's media have become increasingly open since Zhivkov'souster, publishing interviews with leading dissident intellectuals.   The nation's army newspaper today published an interview with anopposition figure who said Bulgaria's one-party system wastotalitarianism.   ``Socialism does not exist anywhere in the world,'' said ZhelyuZhelev, the acting leader of the independent Club for the Supportof Glasnost and Perestroika _ a reference to Gorbachev's programfor openness and social and economic change.   The Narodna Armia newspaper also quoted Zhelev as saying:``There is no new model of production that is more progressive thancapitalism.''</TEXT></DOC>
