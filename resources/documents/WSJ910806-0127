The program, christened Solidarity, has since become themost conspicuous feature of Mr. Salinas's domestic policy.The president has trekked thousands of miles launchingprojects that range from a village schoolhouse to anelectrification plant for one million shantytown residents.</LP><TEXT>   After social spending slowed to a trickle during thedebt-induced depression of the 1980s, Mr. Salinas'sadministration has increased it by 41% since 1988. Thegovernment has spent $3.5 billion through Solidarity, and theprogram now represents a whopping 35% of non-debt governmentoutlays.   As Mexico's crucial Aug. 18 midterm elections draw near,Solidarity is perhaps the main reason that prospects for theruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, are muchrosier than in 1988. According to a recent national poll,almost half of all voters sampled support the PRI. The twoleading opposition parties combined received only 24% ofvoter support. And while most voters polled were critical ofthe PRI's performance in fighting corruption, inflation andunemployment, the ruling party's anti-poverty programreceived high marks. More than 60% of those polled had afavorable image of Solidarity.   A good showing in the midterm elections will strengthenMr. Salinas's hand in further liberalizing Mexico's economy.The PRI is hoping to obtain the two-thirds congressionalmajority required to make constitutional changes in outdatedlaws regarding foreign investment, petroleum and agriculture.   Mexico's political left charges that Solidarity representsexactly the kind of economic populism that President Salinashas long derided. One political columnist accused Mr. Salinasof using Solidarity to conduct &quot;the longest politicalcampaign in history, one that continued even after he tookoffice.&quot;   Mexico's private sector has generally taken a benign viewof Solidarity. &quot;The public deficit is lower than ever,inflation is falling, and Solidarity isn't being funded byprinting money, so how can you criticize it?&quot; asks MiguelJauregui, an investment lawyer.   President Salinas himself has no doubts that the money ofSolidarity is well spent. &quot;As important as structural{economic} reform is social peace,&quot; he has said.   The 1980s sorely tested the tolerance for suffering of the82 million Mexicans, half of whom live in poverty, accordingto government estimates. Spending on health was almostunchanged from 1983 to 1989, even as the population swelled.Mexico faces a deficit of six million houses. Nearly twomillion Mexicans live as squatters. The educational system isin tatters.   Solidarity has made a start in recovering lost ground. Thenumber of health care facilities in rural zones has increased40%. Some 3,000 rural towns have received telephone service.Property rights were awarded to many of Mexico's squatters.About five million Mexicans have obtained electricity. Abouttwo-thirds of all Mexico's primary and secondary schools havebeen refurbished.   Solidarity also supplies Mexicans with an education in Mr.Salinas's market-oriented economic program. Addressing acrowd in an Indian village in the impoverished state ofOaxaca, Mr. Salinas said his government was able to affordprojects like a reconditioned local schoolhouse because ithad sold off unessential government entities, like the statetelephone company. The crowd roared.   &quot;When I talked about the privatization of the telephoneservice,&quot; Mr. Salinas said later, &quot;the people were happy.&quot; Itmay or may not be attributable to Solidarity, but polls showMexicans are much more supportive of a smaller state role inthe economy than they were in the past.   One feature of Solidarity that distinguishes it from mostpork-barrel programs is its emphasis on self-help. In manycases, the government provides the materials for constructionof a road or school, but local residents supply the labor.   That feature bears the clear stamp of President Salinas.As a Harvard University graduate student in the early 1970s,Mr. Salinas lived for a time on a Mexican communal farm whileresearching a thesis on the relationship between publicspending and political support. Mr. Salinas concluded thatpublic works projects weren't necessarily rewarded at thevoting booth. Projects that were ill-conceived or imposedfrom above actually increased opposition to the government,he found.   Mr. Salinas wrote that &quot;the state must therefore delegateto responsible local officials the resources necessary toguarantee the timely and complete execution of projectsinvolving public spending.&quot;   In Solidarity, that has meant for the first time givingmany Mexican municipalities their own public-works budgets.Of 2,400 village governments, only 100 had investment fundswhen Mr. Salinas took office. Now, 1,500 do.   &quot;This is the first time the government has done anythingfor us,&quot; said an official of the Oaxacan village, as hewatched the president inaugurate the schoolhouse. Actually,the government has provided the village with electricity,water and some pavement. But the official is much more awareof the school project because Solidarity let local officialsparticipate in choosing and planning it.   Solidarity clearly had something to do with the PRI'sstrong showing in the July 7 gubernatorial election in thestate of Nuevo Leon, viewed as a portent of the Aug. 18elections. The PRI candidate won more than 60% of the vote inballoting that even opposition leaders acknowledged wasunusually free of fraud. It's no coincidence that prior tothe election Nuevo Leon received a slew of public worksprojects, including an international bridge to Texas that'snamed Solidarity.   &quot;You look at the bridge and see with your own eyes thegood the government is doing,&quot; says Ernesto Aguilera, a NuevoLeon laborer.</TEXT></DOC>
