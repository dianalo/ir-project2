Urines were collected24 h after the treatment and the animals were then sacrificed. The nephrotoxicityof TRI was then studied by measuring certain biochemical parameters characteristicof renal injury and its in vivo metabolism by quantitating the TRI principalurinary metabolites. Treatment of rats with TRI up to 11 mmol/kg didnot influence any of the measured biochemical parameters of nephrotoxicity.On the other hand, significant increases in the urinary level of N-acetyl-beta-glucose-D-aminidase(NAG) and glucose as well as serum urea nitrogen were observed at 24h only at the highest dose level (22 mmol/kg) or TRI. Urinary excretionsof both trichloroethanol and trichloroacetic acid reached an apparentsaturation at the highest dose level of TRI. In inhalation studies, urinarylevels of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, NAG, glucose, proteins, and serumurea nitrogen were significantly increased at 24 h when rats were exposedto either 1000 or 2000 ppm TRI for 6 h. The capacity of renal corticalslices to accumulate p-aminohippurate was significantly reduced 24 hafter the exposure to 22 mmol TRI/kg (ip), or to 1000 or 2000 ppm TRI.These results have demonstrated that TRI exerts its acute nephrotoxicpotential at a very high dose level and produces nephrotoxic insult atthe proximal tubular and possibly glomerular regions of the rat kidney,whether exposed by inhalation or by an ip route. These data further indicatean involvement of a capacity-limited metabolism in the expression ofacute nephrotoxicity due to TRI in Fischer 344 rats.</TEXT></DOC>
