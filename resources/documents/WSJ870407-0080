Mr. Reagan's statement to the Canadian Parliament, capping a two-day summit with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, was aimed at defusing Canadian criticism of the U.S. handling of the acid rain problem, which is caused in large part by sulfur dioxide emissions from U.S. coal-burning power plants. Mr. Mulroney had asked Mr. Reagan for a treaty on the acid rain problem, which the Canadian leader has long called &quot;the litmus test&quot; issue for U.S.-Canada relations.    Mr. Reagan said: &quot;The prime minister and I agreed to consider the prime minister's proposal for a bilateral accord on acid rain, building on the tradition of agreements to control pollution of our shared international waters.&quot;    He reaffirmed that &quot;there are no quick and easy answers&quot; to the acid-rain problem. &quot;But working together, we have made an important start,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me assure you that your concerns are my concerns.&quot;    Senior Canadian officials said in response to President Reagan's statement that they intend &quot;to start tomorrow&quot; drafting Canada's proposal for a U.S.-Canadian acid-rain accord. They said the proposed accord would include targets and schedules for reducing cross-border flows of acid gas pollution.    They said President Reagan's decision was unexpected. &quot;There are a lot of surprised people in both delegations,&quot; one senior Canadian official said.    It remains to be seen, however, whether the president's comments will be anything but window dressing to brighten an otherwise unremarkable third annual summit. Both leaders were striving to make positive news after political setbacks at home; it was Mr. Reagan's first foreign trip since the Iran-Contra scandal broke five months ago and Mr. Mulroney's popularity at the polls has plummeted after a series of scandals in his administration.    Mr. Mulroney hopes to resuscitate efforts, begun by the Carter and Trudeau administrations in 1978, to establish a U.S.ICanada acid-rain accord. The Canadians hope for a pact that would be similar to the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 and similar to subsequent pacts between the two nations to clean up the Great Lakes.    Despite Mr. Reagan's comments, U.S. officials acknowledged privately that they still oppose the Canadians' objective of devising a congressionally approved treaty with specific timetables and numerical goals for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions. The Canadians have pledged to reduce Canadian gas emissions 50% by 1994.    &quot;We are not committing ourselves to negotiate a treaty,&quot; White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker said later. He said the president's comments left both sides &quot;all their options.&quot;    In his speech to Parliament, Mr. Reagan also repeated that he is eager to see the two countries successfully complete negotiations now under way for a free-trade agreement. &quot;We shall commit ourselves and the resources of our administration to good-faith negotiations that will make this visionary (trade) proposal a reality,&quot; he said. &quot;And on this, the Canadian people and the members of Parliament have my word.&quot; U.S. and Canadian negotiators will meet again in Washington Thursday to work on the issue.    Both Canada and the U.S. expressed optimism that they can reach a trade accord this year. U.S. negotiators want Canada to lift barriers to foreign capital investment and to scrap policies that infringe on U.S. drug patents and copyright laws. Washington also is pressing for unrestricted access to the Canadian market for U.S. beer, wine, movies and other products. The Canadians, seeking unrestricted access to the American consumer, want to be exempted from many U.S. trade laws. They also seek a binding mechanism for resolving future trade disputes.    The trade negotiators are working against an Oct. 1 deadline for presenting a final agreement to Congress under a U.S. law providing for &quot;fast-track&quot; consideration of a U.S.-Canada trade pact. The law expires Jan. 3, and both sides believe prospects for such an agreement in future years are slim if the deadline isn't met.    President Reagan also vowed yesterday to &quot;inject new impetus&quot; into discussions over Canada's claim of sovereignty in the waters of the Arctic northwest straits. But U.S. officials said privately that no new ground was broken toward resolving the dispute, in which Canada claims sovereignty over what the U.S. contends is an international waterway. </TEXT></DOC>
