Marks, president of Poc-It Management Services Inc., a SantaMonica, Calif., firm that sells an IS-oriented project management packagecalled MicroMan II.andM;Most project management packages have been designed to manage aerospace orconstruction projects.andP;  These packages don't meet the needs of IS managers,says Marks.andP;  For instance, some packages may be useful for automaticallyscheduling projects, but they fall short when it comes to managing theprojects.andP;  Others may provide progress reports, but aren't able to trackmultiple projects or interproject dependencies common in softwaredevelopment.andM;&quot;$(IS managers$) are now being asked to come up with plans and budgets--andstick to them,&quot; explains Harvey A. Levine, president of Project KnowledgeGroup of Clifton Park, N.Y., a project management consulting company.andP;  &quot;Many[managers] did not have control of their budgets or their schedules, and nowthey're being asked to manage their work as if it were a profit center.&quot;andM;Rising pressures on IS from corporate reorganizations and mergers areprompting IS managers like Sara Lee Hosiery's Chesser to take another look atproject management packages.andP;  As a result, software suppliers are nowtailoring their project management tools to IS departments.andP;  Among thevendors now marketing packages to manage IS development are AGS ManagementSystems Inc., Applied Business Technology Corp. (ABT), Computer AssociatesIntertional Inc., Multitrak Software Development Corp. and Poc-It ManagementServices.andM;Prices for such aids vary according to the package.andP;  For instance, New YorkCity-based ABT's Project Work-bench is priced at $ 1,200 and Poc-It'sMicroMan II is priced at $ 2,800.andP;  Boston-based Multitrak sells a mainframepackage that costs $120,000.andM;Users of these newer IS-oriented packages say they can help prevent runawaysoftware projects.andP;  &quot;The big, visible projects tended to keep themselves onschedule.andP;  What we were losing before instituting project management toolswas a lot of little projects,&quot; says Joseph Mingole, a MicroMan II user anddirector of systems support resources at Time Inc. in New York City.andM;Such project management packages can set development priorities and monitorprogress while projects are under way.andP;  Furthermore, small projects--thosethat take fewer than three days to complete--are apt to be forgotten in theIS development crunch, Mingole says.andP;  By applying IS-oriented projectmanagement techniques, managers can prevent smaller techniques, managers canprevent smaller requests from slipping between the development cracks.andM;Very often, it is these small requests that mean the most to users.andP;  JohnParady, executive vice president for technology services at the Pacific StockExchange, says IS typically wears two very different hats: managingday-to-day data center's needs and responding to user requests for customdevelopment.andP;  &quot;In managing projects, I'm looking for a tool to manage acustom job shop .andP;  .  .  to help me manage the resources, the projects andthe expectations of our clients.&quot;andM;Parady, a 28-year veteran IS consultant and manager, took over the exchange'sIS operations two years ago.andP;  His first impression was of a chaoticdepartment with weak service to users.andP;  Job requests simply were not loggedinto a tracking system.andP;  &quot;Instead, somebody picked up a coding sheet.andP;  Therewas no documentation done, no systems development methodology, no customerfocus, no measurement of performance in the data center in terms ofavailability,&quot; he says.andM;Parady installed MicroMan II a year ago to track and monitor projects anduser requests.andP;  Today, the department has 100 projects under way at any giventime.andP;  &quot;Anybody who runs a system development organization is a fool not tohave some form of automated project management [tool,&quot; he says.andM;Large-Scale SystemsandM;Just as PCs are thriving in software development, PC-based packages likeMicroMan II are expected to quickly dominate the market for IS projectmanagement.andP;  Project Knowledge Group's Levine, for instance, thinks thecurrent popularity of mainframe-based project applications derives more fromthe historical use of mainframes for development than from anything else.andP;  Asmore tasks are transferred to PCs, the role of mainframes in IS projectmanagement will decline, he says.andM;That is not to say that large-scale project management systems will disappearaltogether, however.andP;  Multitrak president Michael Shattow feels that, inlarge organizations where projects may span several physical sites, mainframeproject management is a better choice than PC packages.andP;  His company'smainframe-based package also provides billing services to allocate work amonguser departments -- a chargeback feature not typically available in PC-basedpackages.andM;For instance, New York City-based American Express Co. uses Multitrak tomanage its Genesis projects, a massive IS development undertaking involvingas many as 550 projects at five American Express locations around the world.andO;Genesis is an attempt to create a single customer information and productinformation database.andM;Thomas E. Minerva, vice president of project management at the AmericanExpress Travel Related Service Division and the person responsible forintegrating the Genesis projects, says a PC-based package could neveraccommodate the project's many components.andP;  American Express examined 40project management packages before choosing Multitrak, he says.andM;Yet, American Express also uses ABT's Project Workbench.andP;  &quot;We decided toallow project leaders to use the 'what-if' analysis features of $(ABT's$)Project Work-bench in planning projects and periodically transmit up to themainframe to incorporate both the plan and the status update,&quot; Minerva says.andM;Another company that combines PC and mainframe project management is GTE DataServices Inc. of Tampa, Fla.andP;  GTE allows project leaders to plan projectsusing Project Workbench.andP;  Those leaders consolidate the data on an internallydeveloped mainframe project management package.andP;  The organization, whichprovides services to GTE Corp.'s telephone operating companies in the UnitedStates, uses Project Workbench to develop detailed working time estimates andto allocate staff.andP;  Using the export feature and a proprietary interfacecalled Automatic Update Facility, GTE Data Services then consolidates thedata on the mainframe, from which management reports are generated.andM;Newer PC versions of project management software are starting to incorporateexpert system technologies.andP;  SuperProject Expert, a product of ComputerAssociates International in San Jose, uses an expert system feature toestimate project costs.andP;  The estimating feature, called Estimacs, is based onrules derived from 13,000 completed applications in different industries,according to Joe Lockwood, marketing manager for project management.andM;Integral (formerly Integral Systems Inc.) of Walnut Creek, Calif., usesSuper-Project Expert in customizing its human resources software.andO;Development estimates consistently fall within an accuracy of plus or minus6%, says Wayne Macaulay, vice president of Integral's professional servicesdevision.andP;  &quot;Too many projects are estimated over lunch on a paper napkin andusually come in with an accuracy of plus or minus 200%.&quot;andM;After Integral estimates development costs, a detailed plan to carry out thework is developed using another Super-Project Expert feature, Planmacs.andO;Finally, the data are downloaded to Super-Project Expert, which manages theproject.andP;  The company also sells a mainframe version, called CA-TellaplanExpert, which runs on mainframe and minicomputer systems.andM;CASE IntegrationandM;In yet another sign that IS needs are being taken seriously by vendors, someproject management packages are starting to sport interfaces tocomputer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools.andP;  DMR Group Inc. of Montrealincorporates Excelerator and Poc-It's MicroMan II as part of an ISdevelopment methodology.andP;  ABT's Project Workbench also provides an interfaceto Excelerator, a CASE package from Index Technology Corp. of Cambridge,Mass.andP;  And Multitrak hopes in the near future to have an interface to TexasInstruments Inc.'s Information Engineering Facility CASE tool.andM;These developments suggest that project management packages are becoming moreattuned IS needs.andP;  After all, when was the last time a sports stadium neededa back-end code generator?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
