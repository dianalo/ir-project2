The values of these indicesfor zonal vegetation types are primarily regulated by the heat and moistureratios. An increase in the indices of the total annual increment andalso the increment in green mass of the plant communities is observedfrom the northern to the southern latitudes. The significance of thethird major factor, which determines the living conditions of the plants,namely the influx of nutrients, is manifested particularly clearly inan analysis of the productivity indices of the intrazonal types of plantcommunities, under the conditions of cumulative land areas.</TEXT></DOC>
