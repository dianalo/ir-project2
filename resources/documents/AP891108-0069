QUINN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Maine voters endorsed a ban on cruisemissile flights over the state and backers of the voter initiativepledged to take their fight to Washington to make the non-bindingexpression of sentiment stick.   Tuesday's vote was ``a first step toward stopping the cruisemissile tests,'' said Eric Johnson, campaign manager for theanti-missile forces.   With 587 of 666 precincts reporting, opponents of missile testingled by 104,281 to 94,776, or 52 percent to 48 percent.   The Navy launches unarmed but nuclear-capable Tomahawk missilesfrom submarines. The missiles fly 500 to 6,000 feet above the groundto targets at the Navy Survival School in Rangeley.   Test ban backers object to nuclear weapons on moral and economicgrounds. Opponents of the measure argued nuclear strategy is afederal issue, and said as long as the nation maintains a nucleararsenel it should be tested.   Gov. John R. McKernan opposed the initiative but said he'd pressthe issue with Maine's congressional delegation, ``if that is therequest of the majority.''   The election held a mixed message for anti-nuclear forces.   The voters ratified a state contract for disposing of low-levelnuclear waste at a special dump in Beatty, Nev. The contract,approved by the Legislature but requiring clearance from the voters,was opposed by those who have campaigned to shut down the MaineYankee atomic power plant.   With 88 percent of the precincts reporting, the contract wasendorsed by 106,114 to 88,279, or 55 percent to 45 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
