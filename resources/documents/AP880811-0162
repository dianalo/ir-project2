(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, countering George Bush'sassertion that a Dukakis presidency would weaken the country,portrayed himself Thursday as a tough-minded leader who wouldstrengthen conventional forces and weed out Pentagon waste.   ``We've got to put our defense dollars where our defense needsare greatest,'' Dukakis said in a speech at New York Universitybefore heading to New Jersey to tour the Army base at Fort Dix.   ``We've got to use those dollars to buy weapons that work,'' hesaid. ``And we've got to to manage those dollars to strengthen ourmilitary forces, not to line the pockets of dishonest contractorsand wheeler-dealer consultants.''   The Democratic nominee, on a two-day campaign trip to fivestates, spent eight weeks at Fort Dix in 1955 _ receiving basictraining after joining the Army. From Fort Dix, Dukakis wastraveling to Connecticut for several receptions. He campaigns inVirginia and Florida on Friday.   During his tour of Fort Dix, Dukakis fired a rifle on the targetrange. ``It was fun to be out there,'' he told reporters later atthe base gates.   Dukakis also toured a C-141 transport plane and a tank trainingarea. He told reporters he thought it was a mistake that the Reaganadministration is cutting by the number of Army tanks it will buyin the next five years. That ``deprives our soldiers of theequipment we need and drives up the cost of each tank by 30percent,'' Dukakis said.   Asked by reporters for his reaction to the increase in the primelending rate by major U.S. banks, Dukakis replied, ``I think it'svery regrettable. I think it's what happens after eight years ofborrowing and spending, borrowing and spending.''   In the audience for the NYU speech was New York Gov. MarioCuomo, Mayor Ed Koch, local leaders of Jesse Jackson's presidentialcampaign and Dukakis advisers on defense and foreign policymatters, including former Defense Secretary Harold Brown.   The always-controversial Koch yawned throughout Dukakis' speech.Afterward, Koch said he supported Dukakis but would appreciate someencouragement from the Dukakis campaign.   ``I will go where they will ask me to go; I won't go where theydon't want me to go,'' Koch said.   Cuomo, who introduced Dukakis, said Bush's only responsibilityduring the Reagan years has been to head the administration'santi-drug efforts.   ``And we are losing that war,'' Cuomo said. ``This country andthis world cannot afford second-rate leadership in these criticaltimes.''   Dukakis sounded a similar theme in his speech, although he didnot refer by name to Bush, who has portrayed the Democratic nomineeas weak on foreign policy and defense issues.   ``This November, we Americans face a fundamental choice,''Dukakis said. ``We can seize the opportunity to restore America'sleadership in the world, or we can settle for second best.''   Referring to Reagan administration anti-drug efforts, Dukakissaid he would be a president who ``believes that we don't need morerhetoric or photo opportunities in the war against drugs; we needresults.''   Dukakis aides had billed the speech as a major address onforeign policy and national security, but the Massachusettsgovernor unveiled no new positions on either front. On Thursday,the aides said the speech was a ``framework'' of Dukakis' positionsthat he wanted to give before the Republican National Conventionand that the governor would be more specific about his ideas in thenext few weeks.   Dukakis repeated his desire to continue Reagan's progress onnuclear arms reductions with the Soviet Union but lambasted thepresident's ``Star Wars' space-based missile defense program asunnecessary and too expensive.   Dukakis promised to beef up conventional forces with new tanks,equipment and supplies and said the military should be consideredfor use in anti-drug and anti-terrorism efforts.   He also recalled the words of John F. Kennedy to emphasize hisbelief that United States' international strength depends on astrong domestic economy.   ``He understood that building a full-employment, low-inflationeconomy that creates opportunity for every single citizen in thiscountry was essential to our strength at home and abroad,'' Dukakissaid.   ``Above all, we've got to have a real leader in the White Housewho will insist that when it comes to our national security we'regoing to make decisions based not on what's good for one company orone military service or one political party, but on what's good forthe United States of America,'' Dukakis said.</TEXT></DOC>
