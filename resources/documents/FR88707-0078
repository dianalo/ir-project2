(the licensee)for the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 1 located on the licensee'ssite in Burke County, Georgia. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionBy letter dated February 4, 1988, the licensee, submitted a request fora change of TS 3.6.2.2 which defines the upper and lower volume limitsof the sodium hydroxide solution in the containment spray additive tank.The proposed change alters the percentage of level span corresponding tothe lower limit from 87.7 percent to 89.9 percent and that correspondingto the upper limit from 97.4 percent to 97.2 percent. Also, the bases forTS 3.6.2.2 are revised to specify the limiting volumes of sodium hydroxidedelivered to the containment spray pumps in gallons rather than in thepercentages of level span of the spray additive tank. The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed amendment is required to correct a discrepancy in the TechnicalSpecifications. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionWith respect to the amendment, the volume limits of the spray additivetank correspond to the amount of the sodium hydroxide solution requiredto be delivered to the containment spray pumps. Also, the specified minimumvalue of 8.5 pH for the post-accident containment sump water will stillbe met with this amendment. Accordingly, the amendment will not increasethe probability or consequences of any reactor accident sequence and willnot otherwise affect any other radiological impact associated with thefacility. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significantradiological impacts associated with the proposed amendment. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendmentinvolves features located entirely within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents andhas no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment. Alternative to the Proposed ActionBecause the staff has concluded that there is no significant environmentalimpact associated with the proposed amendment, any alternative to thisamendment will have either no significantly different environmental impactor greater environmental impact.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operations.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the ``Final Environmental Statement related to the operationof the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2'' dated May 1985.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request that supports the proposedamendment. The NRC staff did not consult other agencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the request for theamendment dated February 4, 1988, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Document Room, 1717 H Street NW., Washington, DC, andat the Burke County Library, 412 4th Street, Waynesboro, Georgia 30830.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 30th day of June 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For The Nuclear Regulatory Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David B.
