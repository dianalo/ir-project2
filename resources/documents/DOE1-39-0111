<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-0111 </DOCNO><TEXT>Lithium-lead compounds have attracted considerable interest as a tritiumbreeding blanket materials for fusion reactors. The compositions of lithium-leadsystem such as Li/sub 7/Pb/sub 2/ and Li/sub 17/Pb/sub 83/ are potentialcandidate materials for fusion blanket. Tritium release from neutronirradiated Li/sub 7/PB/sub 2/ and Li/sub 17/Pb/sub 83/ was studied inisochronic conditions in the temperature range 150-600{sup 0}C and 200-400{sup0}C, respectively. Kinetics of tritium release from neutron irradiatedLi/sub 17/Pb/sub 83/ and Li/sub 7/Pb/sub 2/ with initial tritium concentrations2.5 10/sup -2/Ci/g (9,25 10/sup 8/Bq/g) and 1,5 10/sup -1/Ci/g (5,5510/sup 9/Bq.g) was studied in vacuum 1,3 Pa in the temperature range250-320{sup 0}C and 150-425{sup 0}C, respectively. The obtained experimentaldata were treated by the equations describing chemical reaction. Theprocesses are characterised by activation energies of 100 kJ/mol forLi/sub 17/Pb/sub 83/ and for Li/sub 7/Pb/sub 2/ 30 kj/mol in range 150-300{sup0}C and 96 kJ/mol in range 350-425{sup 0}C. After annealing at 450{sup0}C the residual tritium concentrations in lithium compounds are 3-3,7 10/sup 6/ Bq/g.</TEXT></DOC>
