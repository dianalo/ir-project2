(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A trapper harpooned the biggestalligator on record in Florida _ a 13-foot, 10{-inch reptile thatweighed in at 1,043 pounds.   Biologists needed a tow truck to maneuver the gator onto threescales.   Licensed trapper Columbus White hauled the gator out of a lakeApril 17 because patrons of a fish camp 10 miles from Gainesvillefelt threatened, the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commissionsaid Tuesday.   ``We occasionally get reports of gators longer than 14 feet, butthis was the longest and heaviest one ever officially measured inFlorida,'' said Woody Woodward, a biologist with the agency.   It took three hours to land the alligator, White said.   The gator produced 294 pounds of meat and 15 feet of hide with acombined wholesale value of about $2,500, Woodward said.   Two days later, a game officer trapped the largest bear evercaptured in the commission's nuisance bear program. The 475-poundblack bear had been destroying beehives in the Florida Panhandle.   It was too big for a standard trap, so a game officer baited itwith honey laced with a tranquilizer. The bear was later releasedin the area because it was not considered a menace to people.   Before it regained consciousness, a tooth was pulled to checkthe bear's age and discourage the animal from returning to thehives by making him associate the capture and toothache with thesite, said biologist Steve Shea.</TEXT></DOC>
