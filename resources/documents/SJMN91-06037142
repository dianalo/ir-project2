He recently completed a tour promoting his newbook, &quot;Make Room for Danny,&quot; said Norman Brokaw, chairman and chief executiveofficer of the William Morris Agency.;    &quot;It's hard to believe. He reallywasn't sick,&quot; said Brokaw, Thomas' longtime agent.;    &quot;Make Room for Daddy,&quot;renamed &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; after its first three seasons, was one of thelongest-running family comedies, running from 1953 to 1964. Thomas played anightclub singer and comedian, Danny Williams.;    Jean Hagen played his firstwife, Margaret, followed by Marjorie Lord as his second wife, Kathy; AngelaCartwright played Kathy's daughter, Linda; and Rusty Hamer played his son,Rusty. Sherry Jackson and Penny Parker played his daughter, Terry.;    Thetitle came from a phrase used in the real Thomas household. Whenever Thomasreturned home from a tour as a nightclub and radio comedian, his children hadto shift bedrooms to &quot;make room for Daddy.&quot;;    Thomas founded St. JudeChildren's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., in 1962 and regularly madeappearances on behalf of the hospital. It is a leading research centerdedicated to finding cures for children's cancer and other catastrophicchildren's diseases.;    President Reagan presented the Congressional GoldMedal to Thomas in recognition of his fund-raising activities to benefit St.Jude's.;    Longtime friend Milton Berle said Thomas had pushed himself inrecent months promoting his book and appearing at fund-raisers. &quot;I don't knowwhat the wear and tear was on his body but he was so dedicated to St. Jude andthe children he raised millions and millions of dollars for,&quot; Berle said.&quot;He's been driving himself very hard.&quot;;    When Thomas was a strugglingentertainer, he had prayed to St. Jude, patron saint of hopeless cases. Hevowed then that some day he would build a shrine to the saint.;    Born AmosJacobs in Deerfield, Mich., the comedian grew up in a large Lebanese Catholicfamily in Toledo, Ohio. After a number of odd jobs, he moved to Chicago withthe aim of becoming a radio actor.;    He was making a good living as a radioactor when he married Rose Marie Cassaniti in 1936. Their lives changed whenJacobs took a $50-a-week job as emcee at Chicago's 5100 Club. He stayed threeyears and adopted a new name from brothers Danny and Thomas. He moved on tothe prestigious Chez Paree in Chicago, then national fame.;    Another turningpoint in Thomas' career came after his success in nightclubs and radio. Moviestudios wanted to sign him, but there was one problem, as Thomas remembered:;   &quot;Louis B. Mayer said I had the qualities to become a great dramatic actor.;   &quot;Then Mayer told me how Americans go to the movies to live in a dream world,leaving their own humdrum lives behind. They wanted to see beautiful peoplewith perfect faces. So he wanted me to have my nose fixed.;    &quot;Afterward myagent, Abe Lastfogel of William Morris, said, 'You don't have to change yournose. There'll be plenty of work for you anyway.' &quot;;    Lastfogel was right.Thomas starred at MGM and Warner Bros., then moved smoothly into television.;   He is survived by his wife, Rose Marie; daughters Marlo Thomas, actress wifeof talk show host Phil Donahue, and Theresa; and son, Tony.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910206  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  624  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 6, 199100037142,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
