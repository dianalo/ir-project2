Twenty-three atomic tests between 1946 and 1958 turned BikiniAtoll into a radioactive no-man's land. Three of Bikini's 26islands were vaporized.   The enemy on Bikini Island, where most of the resettledBikinians would live, is radioactive cesium-137. The isotope fouledBikini's soil after the explosion of America's most powerfulhydrogen bomb in 1954.   The cesium has made its way into the island's food plants, andscientists say that without treatment locally grown food won't besafe until well into the 21st century.   ``If we solve the cesium-uptake problem, we've essentiallysolved the whole problem of rehabilitating Bikini,'' according toDr. William Robison, a scientist at California's Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratory who has been heading field tests here.   Robison says researchers have come up with three alternativesfor making Bikini safe: scraping up the topsoil in which theradioactive material is concentrated, treating the soil withpotassium to prevent the uptake of radioactivity by plants, andirrigation with sea water.   Removing the topsoil on the 500-acre island is the moststraightforward approach, and also is the most expensivealternative, Robison says. The Bikini Atoll RehabilitationCommittee, set up by Congress to study the radiation problem,determined that removing the topsoil would cost as much as $96million.   To be effective, the removal would have to take the top 16inches of soil off Bikini Island, Robison says. Such a procedurewould be ``a serious environmental insult,'' removing all Bikini'splants and devastating the island's ability to grow vegetation.   ``In addition to all the cesium, it's going to remove all thetopsoil that contains all the nutrients that carry all the organicmaterial it's taken decades to build up,'' Robison says.   Workers removed plutonium from Enewetak Atoll, another nucleartest site in the Marshall Islands, by scraping the topsoil.   Drenching topsoil with sea water has drastically reduced cesiumuptake in test plants, Robison says, but scientists are unsure ofits long-term effectiveness. There also is some question about howmuch damage the salt water would inflict upon plants.   Researchers believe the sea water treatment works in one of twoways: either electrically charged sodium particles block the cesiumfrom entering plant roots or the water filters the cesium furtherinto the soil and out of the reach of plants.   Robison favors a third approach, which involves saturating thesoil with potassium. Cesium is closely related to potassium, whichplants crave. Scientists believe plants mistake the cesium forpotassium, which is rare in Bikini's coral soil.   Robison says plants prefer potassium to cesium and will absorbpotassium if given a choice between the two.   The salt water and potassium treatments control the radioactivecesium, leaving it in the soil until natural decay renders itharmless. The cost of both options is estimated at between $57million and $80 million.   The scaping option, although frowned upon by scientists, has wonwide support among Bikini's leaders, even though it means stayingaway from their home longer. The Bikinians like the fact that soilremoval gets rid of the cesium, instead of simply controlling ituntil it loses its potency.   ``It's the position of the Bikinian people that the radioactivesoil be scraped up,'' says Henchi Balos, a senator representing theBikinians. ``As laymen, it's the only way we can have our peace ofmind.''   A small group of Bikinians returned in the early 1970s whenradiation levels were thought to be safe. But tests in 1978 foundthey were ingesting dangerous amounts of cesium and they wereevacuated.   Tomaki Juda, mayor of Kili Island where some 700 Bikinians nowlive, says Bikini's leaders favor the scraping method in partbecause of the experience in the 1970s.   ``President Johnson said it was safe to come back after theysupposedly did a cleanup,'' Juda says. ``We came back here and 10years later we got moved off again. That makes it hard for us tobelieve them now.''   Jonathan Weisgall, a Washington attorney representing theBikinians, says the United States should abide by the Bikinians'wishes.   ``There's a very strong psychological factor at work here, andif the Bikinians are not convinced Bikini is safe, I'm notconvinced they're going to go back,'' he says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 22</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
