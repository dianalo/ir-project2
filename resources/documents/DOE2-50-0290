The paper presents a new methoddescribing the compressibility of the now known low-grade and high-gradenatural gases fairly accurately. For the time being the calculation methodstill relies on complete gas-analysis data. But efforts are currentlybeing made to simplify the method in such a way as to reduce data inputto a routine partial analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
