Bloom, the would-be financial adviserwho bilked investors out of $15 million to fund a lavish lifestyleof expensive artworks, luxury cars and posh homes, was sentencedFriday to eight years in prison by a judge who called him ``amoral,not immoral.''   Asking the judge to give Bloom, 24, a shorter sentence than thethree-year term handed master Wall Street criminal Ivan F. Boesky,Bloom's lawyer described him as a ``greedy young man and a productof our times.''   ``When he grew up, greed was on the ascendency,'' said thelawyer, David W. O'Connor. ``David Bloom shouldn't wind up being thescapegoat of the 1980s.''   But U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein said he was imposingthe stiff sentence because it was ``absolutely essential'' to send amessage to those who act through ``greed and insatiable lust fordespoiling innocent people.''   The high-living Bloom, whose massive swindle scheme earned himthe title ``Wall Street Whiz Kid,'' pleaded guilty last March to onecount each of mail fraud and securities fraud. Most of the investorshe conned were friends of his parents, according to prosecutors.   In a 15-page sentencing memo to the judge, Assistant U.S.Attorney Robert L. Plotz said Bloom ``victimized close friends ofhis parents'' and ``betrayed the trust not only of these friends butalso of his parents.''   Noting that several of Bloom's victims had turned over pensionplans and individual retirement accounts to him, the memo said Bloom``took everything he could from people who loved him; in so doing,he exhibited a legal and moral depravity.''   ``I have betrayed my own sense of morality and values andbetrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me,'' theshort, bespectacled Bloom, standing with his hands crossed in frontof him, told the judge.   He conceded he was ``deserving of punishment'' but O'Connor urgedthe judge to show leniency because ``this is not Ivan Boesky or(convicted inside trader) Dennis Levine.''   Boesky, who pleaded guilty to securities law conspiracy and iscooperating with investigators, was sentenced to three years inprison last December. Levine, an investment banker caught in amassive insider trading scheme, was sentenced to two years in 1986.   O'Connor called Bloom's crime ``a bizarre aberration,'' and toldthe judge that a stiff sentence was ``not going to discourage thenext screwball who comes along.''   But Edelstein concluded Bloom was ``remorseless, completelylacking in conscience. He was a predator, completely insensitive.''   Edelstein sentenced Bloom to four years on each count and, in anunusual move, ordered the prison terms to run consecutively asspectators in the crowded courtroom gasped.   ``He went on his way without any thought of the pain, sufferingand misery he was inflicting,'' said a disgusted Edelstein. ``He wasamoral, not immoral.''   The judge said Bloom had ``cannibalized his family and friends.''He also ordered Bloom to make ``full restitution.''   No fine was imposed.   Edelstein could have sentenced Bloom to 10 years in prison and$20 million in fines.   According to prosecutors, the boyish-looking Bloom used deceitand fraud to parlay a college investment club into amultimillion-dollar investment operation with about 140 clients.   Bloom, who was not registered as an investment adviser, wooedinvestors for his now-defunct Greater Sutton Investors Group Inc. byfalsely claiming his clientele included the Sultan of Brunei, theRockefeller family and entertainer Bill Cosby.   A 1985 Duke University graduate with an art history degree, Bloomtold clients he was putting their money into the stock market whenhe actually was using it to pay for a lavish lifestyle that includedart works worth $5.5 million; an $830,000 condominium on Manhattan'sUpper East Side; a Long Island beach house worth $1.9 million; andtwo cars _ an Aston-Martin convertible and a Mercedes-Benz _ worth$200,000.   Among the paintings Bloom purchased with other people's moneywere works by John Sloan, Thomas Hart Benton, Mary Cassatt and JohnSinger Sargent.   Bloom began sending his investors bogus account statements thatclaimed to show their securities holdings, according to the charges.   Bloom also was charged with using new clients' funds to pay``profits'' to older clients.   Last January, the Securities and Exchange Commission broughtcivil charges against Bloom, who settled by agreeing to turn overhis assets to a court-appointed receiver and to stay out of thesecurities industry for the rest of his life.   Under the settlement, Bloom neither admitted nor denied the SECallegations but criminal charges were brought in March. Bloom waivedindictment and pleaded guilty March 31 to one count each of mail andsecurities fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
