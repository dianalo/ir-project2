<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0852 </DOCNO><TEXT>This patent describes a method of recovering oil from an interbedded hydrocarbon-bearingsubsurface formation wherein the electrical conductivity of the hydrocarbon-bearinglayers is significantly lower than the electrical conductivity of theother layers. The steps comprise: (a) lowering into a borehole traversinglayers of the formation a metal tubular electrode; (b) covering the exposedexterior surface of an upper portion of the tubular electrode with electricalinsulation as the tubular electrode is being lowered into the boreholewhile leaving a portion of the exterior surface of the tubular electrodefree of electrical insulation; (c) lowering the insulation-free portionof the tubular electrode and at least a part of the upper portion ofthe tubular electrode to a preselected first point, (d) thereafter addingcement to the borehole in a manner such that the cement covers the exteriorof the insulation-free portion of the tubular electrode and the partof the upper portion traversing the part of the formation; (e) perforatingthe electrode and cement at second preselected vertically spaced apartpoints; (f) connecting an alternating current power source to the tubularelectrode; (g) causing alternating current to flow from the tubular electrodeinto the layers of the formation opposite the tubular electrode; and(h) producing oil from the formation, the oil flowing into the tubularelectrode.</TEXT></DOC>
