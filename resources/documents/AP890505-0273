The April jobless rate was the highest since January and movedcivilian unemployment off the more than 15-year low of 5.0 percentposted in March.   The report inspired a broad rally of the stock market, with theDow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbing 17.59 points inthe first 90 minutes of trading.   Some analysts questioned whether the economy has slowed too muchto orchestrate a ``soft landing'' without a recession. The earlyconsensus was that a recession was not imminent, although manyanalysts held fast to predictions one would come late this year ornext year.   ``This is certainly consistent with a soft landing. This is nota sign of a recession in progress,'' said economist Roger Brinnerof Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.   The White House played down the increase in unemployment, withspokesman Marlin Fitzwater noting that the percentage ofworking-age Americans who have jobs remains ``at an all-time highof 63.3 percent.''   The Labor Department's survey of business found the addition of117,000 non-farm payroll jobs in April, the lowest number since thegovernment reported a drop of 92,000 positions in June 1986.   The department also revised March payroll growth to 171,000,down from 180,000, in yet another sign of a slowing economy.   The slower job growth contrasts sharply with the average monthlypayroll growth of 300,000 in the 12 months that ended in February.   The number of unemployed workers also increased in April aftertwo months of decline, rising about 420,000 to 6.5 million,according to the Labor Department's separate household survey.   The business survey found that the average work week in thenon-farm private sector rose 0.4 hours to 35 hours, while themanufacturing work week grew by 0.3 hours to 41.3 hours.Manufacturing overtime edged up 0.1 hour to 4.0 hours.   The department, however, said those figures may well be reviseddownward because the formula for seasonally adjusting the figuresdoes not take into account that the Easter holiday fell in Marchthis year instead of April.   The department said the civilian labor force _ the pool ofemployable people _ grew by 395,000 in April, its largest monthlyjump this year. That would be greeted as good news by financialanalysts who have blamed rising wages on an unusually tight labormarket.   Underscoring market concerns about inflation, the report saidaverage hourly earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent inApril after climbing 0.3 percent for two months.   However, Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics,cautioned against reading the latest wage data as a majorinflationary factor, saying wage growth ``seems to occur in fitsand starts.''   At the same time, she acknowledged that the report was anotherpiece in the mounting evidence of an economic slowdown.   ``The slowdown in March and April is real,'' Ms. Norwood said inprepared congressional testimony. ``While we are not getting netjob losses, we are creating far fewer jobs than we were even a fewmonths ago, and few industries are significantly expanding theiremployment.''   She said some slowdown has to be expected in the record seventhyear of the economic expansion and the slower growth did notnecessarily signal a downturn.   The data make it increasingly unlikely that the Federal ReserveBoard will tighten credit again when its policymaking committeemeets later this month. The central bank has been keeping the tightrein on credit to slow the economy to curb inflation, and recentreports have shown evidence of that slowdown.   The 117,000 growth in non-farm payrolls was about have thenumber predicted by most analysts and occurred almost entirely inthe service sector. Still, the growth even in that strong sectorslowed somewhat, with wholesale trade posting only a modest gain injobs while finance, insurance and real estate reported declines.   Construction posted a modest gain of 6,000 jobs after two monthsof reporting declines.   The increase in the civilian unemployment rate predominantlyaffected men.   The jobless rate among white men rose from 3.6 percent in Marchto 4.0 percent last month, while among Hispanic men it shot up from6.5 percent to 8.3 percent. Unemployment among black men rose from9.8 percent to 10.0 percent.   The unemployment rate among white women also rose, from 3.8percent to 4.1 percent, while among black women it dropped from 9.1percent to 8.8 percent. The government does not break down theHispanic unemployment data by sexes.   Among black teen-agers, the demographic group with by far thehighest jobless rate, unemployment dipped from 34.8 percent to 26.2percent in April.   In a separate caculation of unemployment including militarypersonnel based in the United States, the Labor Department said thejobless rate also rose by 0.3 percentage points, from 4.9 percentto 5.2 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
