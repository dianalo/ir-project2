In the first formal talks since President Bush took office, thetwo sides got down to weighty subjects in detail, according to theleaders of the U.S. and Palestine Liberation Organizationdelegations.   U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau, who headed the three-manAmerican team, said after the meeting that there was a ``newdynamic'' in the Middle East ``of which this dialogue is a part.''   Pelletreau said U.S. concerns about terrorism were discussed aswell as ``practical steps that can be taken in the occupiedterritories to reduce tensions.''   He did not detail those steps, nor did the leader of thethree-man PLO side, Yasser Abed-Rabbo, indicate what the U.S. sidehas asked of the Palestinians.   Abed-Rabbo said progress was made, but he emphasized that the PLObelieves the only road to peace is an international conferenceinvolving the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Counciland all parties to the conflict, including the PLO.   In Washington, an official said on condition of anonymity thatAbed-Rabbo's response to the U.S. plea to take steps in the WestBank was ``indefinite.'' The official spoke after receiving a reportfrom Tunisia.   In another development, Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said hewas concerned that Abed-Rabbo headed the delegation because he issecond-in-command in the Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine, a PLO faction.   The group was accused by Israel last month of sending guerrillason an infiltration mission despite Chairman Yasser Arafat'srenunciation of terrorism in December. The guerrillas wereintercepted.   The U.S. government in its ``Terrorist Group Profiles'' describedthe DFLP, headed by Naif Hawatmeh, as Marxist-Leninist andpro-Soviet in policy. It has ``repeatedly affirmed its hostility andresistance to U.S. policy in the region'' and carried out bombingsand grenade attacks against Israel, the document said.   The talks in suburban Carthage followed a 90-minuteget-acquainted session Dec. 16, the first announced formal meetingbetween the two sides in 13 years.   Police guarded surrounding streets and rooftops.   The meeting was held amid a swirl of confusing Middle East news.One report quoted PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif as saying the PLOwould accept deployment of U.S. troops in the West Bank and the GazaStrip. A U.S. Embassy official briefing reporters on condition ofanonymity dismissed the report with a gesture of incredulity.   Another report spoke of a two-tiered U.S.-backed Israeli peaceplan accepted by the PLO, including as a first step elections ofrepresentative Palestinians in the territories.   Neither issue was mentioned in the statements after Wednesday'stalks, although Abed-Rabbo reiterated the PLO's rejection ofelections in the territories while they are still occupied byIsraeli troops.   The uprising in the West Bank and Gaza has claimed more than 400Palestinian and 17 Israeli lives since it began in December 1987.   ``The (uprising) will continue until the day the Israelisevacuate our homeland,'' said Abed-Rabbo, a leader of the MarxistDemocratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of the mostradical factions in the PLO.   The future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, home to 1.7million Palestinians, ``should be discussed in an internationalconference,'' he said.   Pelletreau indicated recent Palestinian guerrilla raids, whichhad been the subject of a number of informal contacts between himand PLO officials, were also discussed.   ``The PLO is very aware of our very strong view on violence andterrorism,'' he said.   The Israelis strongly oppose Washington's discussions with thePLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.   The United States reversed its policy of not talking to theguerrilla organization after Arafat renounced terrorism in Decemberand recognized Israel's right to exist.   Despite the convivial atmosphere of Wednesday's meeting, thefirst remarks made by an unsmiling Abed-Rabbo to Pelletreau was thatexactly one year ago, the United States decided to close the PLOinformation office in Washington.   Pelletreau's response, in Arabic, was not heard as reporters wereushered from the room.</TEXT></DOC>
