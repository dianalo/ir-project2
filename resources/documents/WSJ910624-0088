Since April 10, 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.has used &quot;Tier 1 capital&quot; as its basic regulatory capitalrequirement. Your table, however, used a definition ofcapital that excluded a significant item that the FDICpermits as Tier 1 capital. It would seem most inappropriate,in an article on the possible FDIC action, to ignore theFDIC's own regulatory standard. In the case of AmericanSavings, this omission understated our capital level by $108million.</LP><TEXT>   You also failed to mention that an agreement has beenexecuted between American Savings and the FDIC under whichthe bank is preparing a plan to comply with regulatorycapital requirements beginning March 31, 1992.   Finally, while noting that some banks &quot;aren't concedingtheir demise,&quot; the article actually pays scant attention tothe efforts of American to improve financial performance. Forexample, since the beginning of 1990, we have cut operatingexpenses, divested non-core businesses, reduced assets bysome $570 million and taken an aggressive approach to loanworkouts. While we are still vulnerable to the difficultiesof the real-estate market, we certainly have not beenpassive.   William G. Lillis   President and CEO   American Savings Bank   White Plains, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
