The government said another major highway was reopened Friday,allowing trucks to carry supplies to Jalalabad, which has beenunder rebel fire for more than five weeks.   Fighting continued on the Salang Highway for nearly two hours,and thick, black smoke billowed from the mountains a few milesaway. The highway, a vital supply route leading into the deprivedcapital, was closed a week ago by Moslem guerrillas who are hopingto starve the city into surrender.   The convoy comprised up to 100 vehicles. As it moved slowly downthe highway, soldiers fired from tanks and machine gun posts intothe surrounding mountains, where the guerrillas are hiding.   Several trucks appeared to have been damaged and one wascarrying several wounded men. Diplomats who spoke on condition ofanonymity said about 600 trucks were still stranded along theSalang.   Another convoy moved out of the capital and down the highwaylinking Kabul and Jalalabad, a provincial capital about 70 milesaway.   The government said the convoy took supplies to governmentsoldiers who had been depending on air drops. The road, which alsois used to ferry supplies to Kabul, was closed to routine trafficalmost two weeks ago.   The guerrillas say they control about 20 miles of the highway,the major route to the border with Pakistan.   The guerrillas have made blockades a primary tactic in theirfight to overthrow the Marxist government, which seized power in anApril 1978 coup.   The Soviet Union has been flying food and military equipment toKabul. Supplies also are being flown to Jalalabad and Khost, saidone senior Soviet source, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The source indicated Moscow would send the Afghan government anyarms it needed to hold Jalalabad.   ``They can have the hardware at our disposal in any numbers theywant,'' the official said. ``Jalalabad must be held. It will beheld.''   The source said about 2,000 government troops had died since theguerrillas began bombarding the city. He said 8,000 rebels had beenkilled in retaliatory strikes.   If Jalalabad falls, it would be the largest city captured by therebels and would give them a base to set up an interim government.   The Afghan armed forces are equipped with sophisticated weaponsfrom the Soviet Union, including long-range Scud-B missiles.   Soviet officials have denied Moscow has sent any new arms toAfghanistan since the Red Army pullout was completed Feb. 15. AU.N. accord that mandated the withdrawal prohibits outsideinterference, but the various signatories have accused each otherof violating that provision.   At the United Nations, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil saidU.S. industrialist Armand Hammer has offered to act as a go-betweento foster peace in Afghanistan.   Wakil, who addressed the Security Council this week, saidHammer, chairman of Occidential Petroleum, invited him to LosAngeles in the next few days to discuss peace prospects. But hesaid the State Department prohibited the meeting.   ``We received his invitation and communicated it to the StateDepartment to get a travel permit. However, this was denied,''Wakil said. ``It was quite strange to see in this advanced and verycivilized nation, where Americans speak of democracy and freemovement, that such rights are denied.''   The U.S. government routinely restricts the travel of officialsof communist countries and those with which the United States hasno diplomatic relations.   Hammer, known for his efforts to establish ties between theUnited States and the Soviet Union, has visited Afghanistan severaltimes in the past two years.</TEXT></DOC>
