While Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega was in Washington, Reagan administration officials had an opportunity to spell out to him how he should implement the Arias peace plan. By refusing to meet and talk, while holding out for Contra aid in early 1988, one must ask whether President Reagan really wants the plan to fail.    This is the same Reagan administration that brought us the Contragate scandal, with its shredded documents, lies to Congress, laundered money and subversion of our constitutional process. The Contras practice terrorism against a civilian population that is hardly communist but vastly Roman Catholic. Even with the reopening of La Prensa -- the opposition press in Nicaragua -- the Contras have failed to produce any written political program for improving life there.    House Speaker Wright by bringing all sides in the Nicaragua conflict -- Sandinistas, church and Contras -- together is getting down to the hard, serious business of working out a peace agreement for a fractious, war-torn society. This is the kind of statesmanship that decent, middle America can take pride in.    Peace in Central America wouldn't only improve life there, it would also vastly improve the national discussion here -- as we bury the Contra -- aid issue in favor of focusing on how U.S. citizens, individually and collectively, can best work to aid and develop an impoverished neighboring land.
