RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The deal the Reagan administration is tryingto make to remove Panamanian military ruler Manuel Antonio Noriegafrom power is prompting renewed concern over using plea bargains incriminal cases.   But even critics acknowledge that such negotiations, whilestirring public outrage at times, are essential to prosecutors andthe courts.   ``This takes the air out of the guts of agents who are bustingtheir chops fighting drug smuggling,'' Joseph diGenova, a formerU.S. attorney in Washington, said of the Noriega negotiations.``They're going to ask, `Why the hell was he indicted in the firstplace?'''   But diGenova quickly added, ``Plea bargaining is perfectlyproper. It depends on the what the bargain is. What does the U.S.government get out of it?''   The Reagan administration said Thursday it was discussing a dealthat could result in the dropping of drug-trafficking chargesagainst Noriega in exchange for his agreement to relinquish power.But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to say if thedrug charges were involved in the plea bargain.   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said if the arrangementworks it ``would be the most fruitful and productive plea bargainthat we have seen in a long time.''   Plea bargains _ resulting in reduced prison terms, probation ordropped indictments _ sometimes may resemble distasteful deals withthe devil. But they are an entrenched part of the criminal justicesystem, a vital tool for easing crowded court dockets or persuadinga defendant to testify against a higher-up in a criminal conspiracy.   Prosecutors also bargain with defendants because they fearweaknesses in their cases, settling for a reduced sentence ratherthan risking acquittal.   ``There are always plea bargains you would rather not make,''said Lawrence Barcella, a former U.S. attorney. ``Do I regret them?Yeah, I regret a lot from the emotional standpoint. From theintellectual standpoint, I agree with all of them.''   Barcella said it may well be that the Reagan administration``views the presence of Noriega as such a cancer on the people ofPanama'' that it is willing to let him off the hook to get him outof power.   But Barcella also noted that there was a slim chance Noriegaever would be brought to trial in the United States even if thecharges against him were not dropped. The difficulties inextraditing a foreign leader or forcing his expulsion from hishomeland could be insurmountable, he said.   One of the most publicized plea bargains in the nation's historyled to the resignation of then-Vice President Spiro T. Agnew onOct. 10, 1973.   Agnew pleaded no contest to federal income tax evasion and wasfined $10,000 and sentenced to probation for three years.   Agnew had been under investigation in a probe of allegedpolitical graft and bribe-taking dating back to his days as acounty executive and then governor of Maryland before Richard Nixonpicked him as his running mate.   The plea agreement prompted outrage in some quarters. Butthen-Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson said it was an honorableend to the Justice Department's investigation.   Richardson said the evidence ``establishes a pattern ofsubstantial cash payments'' to Agnew while he was governor ofMaryland in return for state engineering contracts. But the formerattorney general said Agnew's resignation and the stain on hisreputation were punishment enough.   In 1985, E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., a leading Wall Street brokeragefirm, pleaded guilty to 2,000 felony counts of mail and wire fraudin a $4.35 billion scheme to write checks exceeding funds ondeposits at more than 400 banks.   No individuals were named in the charges, and no one went tojail. But Hutton paid a $2 million fine, plus $750,000 to help payfor the government's investigation. The company also agreed to setup an $8 million fund to make restitution to the banks.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said the agreement sent ``amessage to the business world that so-called white-collar crime ...will not be tolerated.''   But critics said the company and its officials escaped withbarely a slap on the wrist.   The Carter administration was criticized by some when in 1977former CIA Director Richard C. Helms pleaded no contest to twomisdemeanor charges of failing to testify fully about the agency'sattempts to prevent the election of Marxist Salvador Allende aspresident of Chile in 1970.   The government said it accepted the plea to avoid accidentaldisclosure of government secrets if Helms went to trial.   Helms was fined $2,000, placed on probation for a year anddeclared ``in disgrace and shame'' by U.S. District JudgeBarrington D. Parker.   In contrast, a plea agreement in March this year involvingformer presidential aide Robert C. McFarlane caused hardly a ripple.   McFarlane pleaded guilty to misleading Congress by assuringlawyers the Reagan administration was not helping arm Nicaraguanrebels during a ban on U.S. military aid.   McFarlane has not yet been sentenced.</TEXT></DOC>
