Poindexteroccurred on the White House's electronic-mail system, on an IBM PC-basedproduct known as the Professional Office System, or Profs.andM;Profs tapes are not backed up permanently but instead are recycled for useand written over.andP;  Backup tapes from the two White House Profs systems, onein the Executive Office of the President and a second secure system in theNational Security Council, are made in case of a system failure.andP;  But thesebackups usually are kept no longer than six weeks.andM;The National Security Archive, created by a group of former investigativereporters to gather government information released through the Freedom ofInformation Act (FOIA), asked the White House in repeated FOIA requests forany copies of existing Profs backup tapes.andM;The White House denied the requests from the archive's executive director,Scott Armstrong.andP;  &quot;The data generated on the Profs system does not constitute'agency records' under the FOIA,&quot; Peter W. Bateman, director of the Office ofAdministration, wrote in a letter to Armstrong.andP;  &quot;Agency record materialwithin the Office of Administration is kept in hard-copy format.&quot;andM;Lost RecordsandM;The lawsuit deals with two chief concerns, said Eddie Becker, a consultant tothe archives.andP;  First, without any permanent backup, Profs notes not printedout to hard copy and entered into the official White House records system arelost forever to historians, he said.andM;Second, as in the Iran-Contra affair, the Profs system can be used for&quot;rogue&quot; activities by White House staff, Becker said.andP;  If both the sender andreceiver of a message or document transmitted through the system delete thematerial before a backup, the information is erased.andP;  Now, without permanentbackup or some sort of immediate backup to disk, these Profs notes are lostanyway, he said.andM;North said at the point House-Senate hearings on Iran-Contra in July 1987,the general practice was to delete messages from the system.andP;  &quot;We allsincerely believed that when we sent a Profs message to another party andpunched the button 'delete' that it was gone forever,&quot; he testified.andP;  &quot;Wow,were we wrong.&quot;andM;Numerous White House and NSC memos, as well as the White House Office StaffManual, instruct staff members to print out Profs notes with enduring valueor those detailing work assignments.andP;  One NSC memo called this a&quot;long-standing policy.&quot;andP;  The hard copies were to be submitted to the Officeof the Secretariat for the official White House record.andM;But during depositions and testimony to Congress, Poindexter denied this wasa general practice with Profs notes.andP;  &quot;Once in a while I would get a Profsnote, if it was something I wanted to brief the president on, I would printout a hard copy of it.andM;&quot;I had a little printer by my desk,&quot; he said, according to the congressionalreport on the Iran-Contra investigation.andP;  &quot;And consistent with my policy ofdeleting my Profs notes, I tore up those Profs notes, as well.&quot;andM;The National Security Archive has been unable to obtain copies of any Profsnotes from the White House.andP;  It did succeed through a court order to get acopy of all backup tapes available as of Jan. 21 saved from destruction byrecycling.andM;Backup TapesandM;These include 31 tapes from the Executive Office of the President and 144tapes from the National Security Council being held by the White HouseCommunications Agency.andP;  The White House estimated the Executive Office tapesalone equal roughly 2 million pages of information.andM;&quot;We are still fighting for a court ruling that would force them to preservethe Profs backup tapes permanently,&quot; Armstrong told a House GovernmentOperations Subcommittee in May.andM;&quot;The government's pleadings argue that the Profs information does not rise tothe level of a record' -- conveniently ignoring more than a hundredsubstantive Profs notes we have entered into the record from the Oliver Northtrial and other Iran-Contra proceedings,&quot; he said.andM;Some of the Profs notes acquired through congressional investigation camefrom paper files in the White House.andP;  Others, however, were reconstructed byinvestigators from data obtained through a hex dump of existing backup tapes.andM;The Justice Department has called for dismissal or summary judgment of thelawsuit, claiming the court has no legal right to decide on a casequestioning the actions of the executive branch.andP;  The government attorneysargued the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which guides the executiveoffice in record keeping, preserves the separation of powers principle.andM;&quot;Neither the archivist nor Congress has any authority under the PresidentialRecords Act to veto the president's determination regarding record disposal,&quot;the request for dismissal said.andP;  &quot;During the term of the president, absolutecontrol over presidential records remains within the executive branch.andM;&quot;The act was specifically designed not to allow intrusion by the public,Congress or the courts into the record-keeping activities of the chiefexecutive.&quot;andM;Gaylord Nelson, former Democratic senator from Wisconsin and an author of theact, disagrees.andP;  He joined the National Security Archive in the lawsuit.andM;The Presidential Reecords Act, which took effect in 1981, gives the presidentand his staff authority to decide what White House materials are records.andM;The White House Office Staff Manual gives a lengthy description of apresidential record and makes specific reference to the law.andP;  &quot;Presidentialrecords encompass any form of memorializing information, inlcuding but notlimited to written documents, models, pictures, films and audio, andelectronic recording,&quot; the manual said.andM;&quot;The law imposes an affirmative obligation on staff members to documentadequately the performance of the president's constitutional, statutory andceremonial duties,&quot; the manual said.andM;Presidential GuidanceandM;The law also requires the president to seek the guidance of the government'snational archivist before disposing of any records.andP;  The National Archivesand Records Administration (NARA) staff never saw any Profs notes beforeallowing their regular destruction, according to depositions from White Houseand NARA staff.andM;&quot;They don't even know what they're acquiescing in the destruction of which Ithink is pretty outrageous,&quot; said Katherine A. Meyer, an attorney with PublicCitizen, who is representing the plaintiffs in their case.andM;Meyer said the plaintiffs want NARA To have more authority, and the lawsuitquestions the integrity of NARA actions concerning Profs notes.andP;  In adeclaration given in February, U.S.andP;  deputy archivist, Claudine J. Weihersaid the NARA staff believed hard-copy Profs notes were included in the Whitehouse record when necessary.andM;&quot;These procedures were consistent with NARA's understanding of thePresidential Records Act and with advice given by NARA to federal agenciesabout similar electronic systems,&quot; Weiher said.andM;&quot;If we win, it will set a precedent that destroying this information isillegal,&quot; Meyer said.andP;  She promised to take the case to the Federal Court ofAppeals if the lower court decides in favor of the government.andM;&quot;I think this case is going to go on for a long time,&quot; she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
