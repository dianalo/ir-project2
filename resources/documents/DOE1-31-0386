Sinse biopsy of osteolyticPaget disease may increase the likelihood of fracture, expecially ina weight-bearing long bone, an accurate radiographic diagnosis is important.Observation of a flame-shaped front of osteolysis or other radiographicfeatures of Paget disease may be helpful. Exacerbation of radiographicosteopenia with immobilization, and remineralization with mobilizationof the affected extremity, are findings which would also support thediagnosis of Paget disease. If the patient presents with a pathologicalfracture, as occurred in the two cases described here, a biopsy is appropriateto help establish the diagnosis, and to exclude sarcomatous transformation.A similar histological appearance might be found in patients with hyperparathyroidism,but the absence of the appropriate serological abnormalities and thecharacteristic radiographic findings in other bones, should exclude thatdiagnosis.
