Iraq saidit repulsed the invaders.   Iran claimed Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on theattackers but said chemical warfare units neutralized the poisongas and kept casualties to a minimum.   Revolutionary Guards stormed through mine fields and thickets ofbarbed wire in a two-pronged offensive before dawn in the Salamchehregion, killing or wounding more than 11,500 Iraqis and capturing2,100, Iran said.   Iraq acknowledged the Iranians broke through border defenses ina ``reckless assault'' 15 miles east of Basra, the southern portand provincial capital. The Iraqis said their 3rd Army Corps``absorbed the momentum'' and ``completely destroyed'' theoffensive in a 19-hour battle which was supervised by PresidentSaddam Hussein and resulted in ``a new victory.''   The Iraqi president returned to Baghdad on Monday evening afterthe fighting settled in the favor of Iraqi troops, Baghdad radioreported.   Iran claimed the Revolutionary Guards, supported by artillerybarrages and air strikes, were ``holding the upper hand.''   An Iraqi communique said Iraqi planes flew 170 combat missionsand helicopter gunships flew 240.   That is the highest single-day tally of Iraqi missions inmonths. The communique said the aircraft destroyed nearly 200vehicles and inflicted ``enormous losses.''   No independent confirmation of the conflicting claims wasavailable. Neither side allows Western journalists or other neutralobservers into combat zones except on rare guided tours.   The Iranian attack was seen as a bid by Iran's newcommander-in-chief, Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, toregain military initiative lost by defeats in the past two monthsof the war, which began nearly eight years ago.   It was not clear how many Iranian troops were involved in thethrust. Tehran communiques indicated the assault forces initiallyengaged at least 11 infantry and armored brigades, an estimated40,000 men.   Since it is standard military practice for an assault force tooutnumber defenders at least 2-1, that would indicate about 80,000Iranians.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted anunidentified Revolutionary Guards commander at the front as callingthe Iranian offensive ``a crushing response to recent Iraqimovements in Salamcheh.''   It said air force planes flew 19 ground-attack sorties and that28 missions by helicopter gunships destroyed ``tens of tanks andarmored personnel carriers ... creating a hell of fire for theIraqi forces.''   The commander claimed anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqiwarplane in the region, but did not disclose the type of the jetreportedly downed.   According to Iraq's communiques, one of its air strikes was onan Iranian air base near the western city of Dezful, apparently toknock out Iranian jets supporting the offensive.   Reports in official Iranian media in the past two weeks havesaid thousands of ``basij,'' or volunteers, were going to the front.   In its reports of the battle, IRNA said Iranian troops brokethrough Iraqi defenses and destroyed at least 30 Soviet-made tanks.   It said the attackers caused heavy casualties in six infantrybrigades and wiped out three artillery battalions that were caughtin the open.   Dispatches from the official Iraqi News Agency quoted a militaryspokesman in Baghdad as reporting an Iranian offensive east of FishLake, an area northeast of Basra flooded several years ago tofrustrate Iranian assaults.   He said the Iraqis were preparing a counteroffensive ``that willteach the enemy a good lesson.'' According to the Iranians, Iraqisoldiers counterattacked at noon but were driven back with the lossof 800 killed or wounded.   IRNA dispatches said the battlefield was littered withknocked-out tanks and armored vehicles of Iraq's 3rd ArmoredDivision and 5th Mechanized Infantry Division.   Elements of both divisions were involved in the Iraqi assaultMay 25 that drove the Iranians out of their hard-won bridgeheadeast of Basra and back across the frontier. The offensive Mondaywas the first major Iranian operation since that battle.   Iran seized the marshlands east of Basra with huge losses inJanuary and February of 1987 and fought to within 6 miles of thecity.   Two years ago, Iranian forces captured the Faw Peninsula southof Basra. On April 18, Iraq's 7th Corps recaptured it in a 34-hourbattle that began with a surprise attack.</TEXT></DOC>
