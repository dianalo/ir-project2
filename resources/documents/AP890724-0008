The agreement, which provides banks with three options to chosefrom in providing assistance to Mexico, marks the firstbreakthrough for the Bush administration's Third World debtstrategy.   Officials involved in the talks estimated that the package hadthe potential of reducing by up to one-third the $4.5 billion inpayments Mexico must make annually to service the $54 billion itowes to commercial banks.   However, the exact benefits of the plan will not be known formany months until the individual banks holding the loans makedecisions regarding the extent to which they will participate inthe debt reduction package arrived at Sunday.   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari hailed the accord ina nationwide television and radio address in that country. He saidit answered ``the cry of Mexicans to return to growth'' and``opened a breach'' for other countries with similar debt problems.   Salinas described the negotiations as ``difficult, complex andtense.''   The successful conclusion of the negotiations came after U.S.Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan joined in the final stages of the marathon discussions.   Brady, emerging after the talks ended late Sunday, said, ``Yousee a lot of smiles around here,'' but he refused to discussspecifics of the final agreement.   However, another official, who spoke on condition that his namenot be used, said the final package offers banks two ways toprovide debt relief to Mexico.   They can agree to reduce the principal on the old loans by 35percent or they can agree to reduce the interest being charged onthe loans to 6.25 percent. A third option commercial banks willhave is providing new loans to Mexico.   Those banks willing to reduce principal or cut the interestcharged will be able to get guarantees on the remaining debt fromthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the twomultinational lending agencies that are backing theadministration's debt strategy.   In a statement, Brady called the Mexican agreement ``a majorstep forward in the implemenation'' of the administration's debtreduction initiative.   ``The agreement between Mexico and its creditor banks willprovide significant debt and debt-service reduction for Mexico, aswell as new money, to support Mexico's economic growth,'' Bradysaid.   He said the United States, working with other countries, waswilling to offer Mexico short-term financing of up to $2 billionuntil Mexico began receiving the new money agreed to in the plan.   The negotiating teams for the final agreement were led byMexican Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe and John Reed, chairman ofCiticorp and the head of the committee representing commericalbanks in the talks.   Both men were smiling when they emerged from the talks, held inBrady's office and various conference rooms on the third floor ofthe U.S. Treasury.   The official Mexican new agency, Notimex, said there werelast-minute negotiations over a ``readjustment clause'' that wouldincrease debt payments once the Mexican economy got moving again.   But the official who discussed the talks said that both sideshad agreed to tie increased debt payments to any improvements inMexico's export sales after the year 1996.   The so-called ``readjustment clause'' has reportedly been asticking point in the talks, with Mexico maintaining that raisingdebt payments at a later date might block an economic recovery thatthe cuts are designed to foster.   The fact that Brady and Greenspan were both participating in thetalks was an indication of the high priority the United States hasplaced on completing a deal with Mexico, the country which isconsidered the test case for the administration's new initiative toreduce debt.   Last March, Brady unveiled the strategy which sought to reduce aportion of the $1.3 trillion debt burden being carried by ThirdWorld nations by offering various inducements to persuadecommercial banks to forgive a portion of their loans.   The administration had hoped to have a finished Mexican debtpackage to present during the seven-nation economic summit heldweek in Paris. To help move the talks along, President Bush held ahurriedly scheduled meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinasde Gortari.   While the talks between Mexico and its creditor banks failed toarrive at a breakthrough before the summit ended, Bush wassuccessful in winning backing for the strategy in the finaleconomic communique.   The administration also announced in Paris that the UnitedStates was prepared to put up between $1 billion and $2 billion asan emergency ``bridge'' loan to supply money until funds startarriving from the commercial banks.   ``With this accord we have achieved our goal of reducing from 6to 2 percent (of the gross national product) our net transfersabroad,'' an anonymous source close to the talks said, according toNotimex.   The $54 billion owed to private banks represents about half ofMexico's $107 billion foreign debt, the second largest in thedeveloping world after Brazil's.   Reducing the crushing debt is the centerpiece of PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari's policy. It is seen in Mexico as the keyto getting the nation's stagnant economy moving again.   Mexico's debt crisis began with a borrowing spree during the oilboom years of the late 1970s. When the bottom fell out of the oilmarket in 1982, the Mexican economy went into a tailspin that hasseen the average worker's buying power fall by half.   The economic crisis sparked fears of political instability asunhappy Mexicans began turning against the party that has ruled for60 uninterrupted years. Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, washeld to the smallest margin of victory in party history in lastyear's presidential elections.</TEXT></DOC>
