You see, nobody ever thinks of printing things in reverse.&quot;andM;The idea was then developed into a workable form by 3M, and has acquired thename Project Dawn (for the dawn of a new era).andP;  Over a million passports havebeen issued under phase one of Project Dawn - the printing of the detailsonto the laminate.andP;  Phase two has seen the signature and photograph alsoprinted on the laminate (in black and white), and the third phase involvesthe installation of color laser printers in all Australian passport officesfor full color photograph prints on the laminate.andM;A further extension of the system could see data terminals capable ofdisplaying color images installed at airports.andP;  These would access a databaseof photographs held by the Department, and would help in the verification ofidentity should problems arise.andP;  The Department is also examining thepossibility of marketing the idea, which it feels has numerous applications,including drivers licences, identity cards and credit cards.andM;(Sean McNamara/19910506)</TEXT></DOC>
