Emmanuel Hammond, 24, was sentenced Friday by the jury that hadconvicted him Wednesday of the kidnapping, murder and armed robberyof Julie Love, a 27-year-old Atlanta preschool fitness teacher.   A racist letter from a group claiming responsibility for thepre-Christmas mail bomb deaths of Judge Robert Vance of the 11thU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and Savannah lawyer Robert Robinsonsaid the attacks were motivated by outrage over Miss Love's killing.   Hammond is black. Love was white.   Miss Love's father, Jerry Love; her stepmother; and her fiancewere in the courtroom when the sentence was announced.   ``I'm very grateful to the jury, the prosecutor and the judgefor what they did, and I feel that justice was done,'' Love said.``It's a victory of sorts, but a very shallow victory.''   The victim's fiance, Mark Kaplan, said, ``An impartial jury,black, white, male and female, made a decision that sent out astrong signal _ that society is not going to put up with this typeof savage behavior.''   The judge ordered the execution to take place next month, butthe conviction and sentence automatically will be appealed.   Miss Love disappeared in July 1988. Her body was found in awooded dumping ground 13 months later. She had been shot in thehead.   Hammond's co-defendant and cousin, W. Maurice Porter, haspleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and rape in the killing. Hehas not been sentenced.</TEXT></DOC>
