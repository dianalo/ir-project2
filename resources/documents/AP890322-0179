SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The State Department warned the Romaniangovernment on Wednesday of ``serious consequences'' if it takesaction against six retired communist officials who've criticizedPresident Nicolae Ceausescu's regime.   The six signed a letter that demanded improved human rightspolicies and an immediate halt to food exports from theshortage-plagued country. The letter, reportedly sent in January,marked the first time senior communists banded together to protestthe tough approach of Ceausescu, who's been in charge since 1965.   Earlier this month, the son of one of the signators was arrestedand charged with espionage, apparently in connection with theprotest.   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the U.S.government was concerned about the prospect of repressive measuresagainst ``distinguished Romanians'' or their families ``who haveexercised their right of free speech in an open letter to the regimein Bucharest.''   The spokesman noted that 12-nation European Community hasexpressed concern about the matter.   ``Infringements of free speech would constitute a violation ofRomania's human rights commitments, including those of the HelsinkiFinal Act and the Vienna Concluding Document, which Romania hasaccepted,'' Redman said, adding, ``Romania's failure to uphold suchcommitments would be an affront to the international community.''   In the letter, the former officials attacked Romania's isolationin Europe and Ceausescu's plans to destroy up to 7,000 of thecountry's 13,000 villages in a resettlement campaign.   The letter also condemned a late 1970s decree that forbidsRomanians to speak to foreigners and denounced alleged systematicviolations of private mail and telephone communications.   Redman said U.S. officials in Bucharest have been instructed tomake clear to the Romanian government ``that we would regard anythreat to the human rights of the people concerned as a violation ofRomania's international commitments, and it would have seriousconsequences for U.S. relations with Romania.''   Asked to detail what type of actions the U.S. government mighttake, Redman declined to say, adding only, ``I can only assure youthat we're watching the situation closely and that we will actaccordingly.''   The son of one of the protesting retirees, Mircea Raceanu, wasaccused of engaging in ``steady treasonable action'' since 1974,according to an announcement made last week by the Romanian GeneralProsecutor's office and reported in the state news agency Agerpres.   Raceanu, who reportedly was arrested in January, served inWashington during the 1970s and most recently was deputy head of theForeign Ministry's U.S. desk in Bucharest.</TEXT></DOC>
