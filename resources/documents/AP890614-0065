(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After starting their first atomic chainreaction, officials at the long-delayed Seabrook plant said theyknow how Thomas Edison must have felt when he lit the first electriclight bulb in 1879.   ``We certainly haven't reinvented the light bulb,'' Seabrook'stop executive, Edward Brown, said Tuesday. ``But we believe there isgreat significance in our success.   ``Have we changed history? Some people are saying so,'' Brownsaid. ``Seabrook Station has faced one of the longest, mostconvoluted licensing processes that any commercial nuclear powerplant has ever encountered in this world.''   The plant symbolizes the troubled state of the nation's nuclearpower industry. Seabrook's owners originally planned two reactors ata cost of $973 million, the first to start commercial operation 10years ago. But repeated regulatory delays drove the first reactor'spricetag up to $6 billion and forced cancellation of the secondreactor, 25 percent complete.   The plant also became a focus of anti-nuclear activism. Protestssince construction began in 1976 have resulted in more than 3,200arrests, including 734 arrests in two days of civil disobedienceearlier this month.   Despite its woes, the seaside plant was completed in July 1986and last month won its low-power testing license, which allows it toconduct tests at up to 5 percent of full power.   Three faulty safety valves set back the start of fission by abouta week, but at 5:23 p.m. Tuesday, Seabrook operators started a chainreaction in the plant's 100 tons of uranium fuel.   Operators plan to conduct tests for about seven days at powerlevels ranging from a fraction of 1 percent to 3 percent of capacity.   Tests continued smoothly today at 0.01 percent of power, plantspokesman Ron Sher said. The reactor was at up to 1 percent duringthe night as operators tested properties of the uranium fuel, Shersaid.   On Tuesday, about 30 Seabrook workers broke into applause andshook hands when told the reactor had split its first atoms.   ``We have crossed the threshold,'' said Joseph Grillo, theoperations manager. ``We are in the homestretch toward full-poweroperation, and everyone here is excited about it.''   Still unresolved is whether Seabrook will ever operatecommercially. It must win federal approval for evacuation plans forcrowded beaches and communities up to 10 miles away _ including sixcommunities in Massachusetts, which refuses to cooperate.   Seabrook has developed its own evacuation plans forMassachusetts, and Nuclear Regualtory Commission licensing boardhearings on them are expected to finish later this month. Seabrookofficials hope to win a commercial license this fall.   Plant foes, led by Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon,have promised to fight to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary toblock a commercial license.   But Brown, president of Seabrook operator New Hampshire Yankee,was confident the plant would run commercially.   ``The opposition also said they were going to take us to court onthe low-power license. They didn't win,'' Brown said.   ``It's inevitable this plant is going to operate, and we'd bemuch better off if (Massachusetts) would participate in emergencyplanning.''   Seabrook's owners also may have to prove they are financiallyqualified to run the plant commercially. Lead owner Public ServiceCo. of New Hampshire is under federal bankruptcy protection, andsome of the other 11 New England utilities with stakes in the plantalso face financial problems.</TEXT></DOC>
