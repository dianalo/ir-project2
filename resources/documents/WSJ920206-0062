The data suggested an increasing likelihoodthat an ozone hole will develop over densely populated areasin the Northern Hemisphere. In recent days, senior WhiteHouse officials have been discussing what to do in responseto the data.   The U.S. is already committed, under an internationaltreaty, to a phase-out schedule for the production ofchlorofluorocarbons, which are used as refrigerants andsolvents, and other chemicals that destroy the stratosphericozone layer. Under the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act,the EPA can speed up the phase-out if new data indicate aneed to do so. The ozone layer is crucial for shielding theEarth from ultraviolet radiation, which leads to increasedskin cancer and crop damage.   Officials cautioned that differences remain within theadministration on whether to seek an acclerated phase-out andhow fast any speed-up should be.   There is considerable support among European countries foran acceleration. In April, a group of countries that havesigned the treaty will meet in Nairobi, Kenya, to work onrevisions with the hope of completing the efforts before aNovember meeting in Copenhagen.   Moreover, bolstering the case for a speed-up is thatproducers of the chemicals support the idea. The U.S. isalready ahead of the treaty's requirement that production beended by 2000. Kevin Fay, executive director of the Alliancefor Responsible CFC Policy, a coalition of users andproducers of CFCs, said that most output of CFCs for newproducts could be ended by 1996. &quot;The transition tosubstitute products for new equipment is going well,&quot; hesaid.   Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.) is pushing an amendment tothe Senate energy bill that would require a faster phase-outof CFCs and other chemicals.   Even before the release of the NASA data, environmentalgroups had been pressing the EPA to order an acceleratedphase-out, and they are pushing for faster action than theindustry supports. &quot;The science clearly demands that we befinished with these chemicals as rapidly as possible,&quot; saidDavid Doniger, senior attorney at the Natural ResourcesDefense Council. The council is calling for an end to CFCproduction by 1995.   In addition, the industry wants to be allowed to retainsome CFC production to service existing equipment, while thecouncil is pushing for a full phase-out.</TEXT></DOC>
