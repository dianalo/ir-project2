The primary objective is toobtain an estimation of the cumulative frequency of non-occupationalexposures to home and garden pesticides through the air, dermal, drinkingwater, and dietary routes. In a nine-home pilot study designed to testmethodology, 22 of 28 of the most commonly used household pesticideswere detected. Five of these were measured in the air in the majorityof the households at concentrations ranging up to several {mu}g/m{sup3}. Personal air measurements suggested that 80% of the total respiratoryexposures resulted from indoor air. Subsequent to the pilot study, alarge-scale, multi-season monitoring program involving up to 175 homesin a high-use southern US city and about 85 homes in a low-use northernUS city was initiated.</TEXT></DOC>
