The process, known as catalytic oxydehydrogenation, wasinvented and patented last year by a research team atLawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which is operated by theUniversity of California for the Energy Department.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement calls for a two-year program to determinewhether the technology can be scaled -- up to a commerciallevel and if it is economically feasible to do so.   The two chemicals, used in gasoline as well as the mostwidely used plastics, are made from petroleum. If the newprocess proves feasible, it would reduce pollution frompetroleum &quot;cracking.&quot;   Montedison said the commercial success of the potentialnew use for natural gas depends on the economics of theprocess as well as the prices of crude oil and natural gas.   Montedison is part of the Italian agroindustrial FerruzziGroup.</TEXT></DOC>
