The pilot of a Panamanian-registered tanker was completinga complicated turn into the cramped Houston Ship Channel lastsummer when he saw heading toward him a tugboat pushing anoil-filled barge.</LP><TEXT>   The pilot, Michael B. Gale, frantically radioed thetugboat. &quot;I can't, I can't stop this thing,&quot; he said.   The tugboat operator, Mason T. Ware, responded: &quot;I can'tstop now. Lord of Mercy, Skipper.&quot;   Five seconds later, Mr. Ware cleared his throat and said,&quot;There ain't nothing I can do, Cap.&quot;   The collision came 2 1/2 minutes later, as the Panamanianship, the Rachel B, plunged into the barge, ripping open ahole through which 240,000 gallons of oil flowed into thewater near the Gulf of Mexico.   As this and countless other incidents -- such as lastweek's fire aboard the tanker Mega Borg -- illustrate, thenation's system of transporting oil by tanker is a wreck. Ontwo out of every three days, on average, an oil tanker inU.S. waters catches fire, explodes, collides with a dock oranother ship, breaks apart, experiences mechanical failure,runs aground or winds up in some other kind of accident,Coast Guard accident reports indicate.   &quot;This is the single most important issue we see rightnow,&quot; says Admiral J. William Kime, the Coast Guardcommandant.   Last week's Mega Borg incident could have become thebiggest spill in U.S. history. For four agonizing days lastweek, fire roared from the 886-foot Norwegian supertanker.Crippled, it settled lower and lower, threatening to dump astaggering 38 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.   Then, slowly, firefighters won control. In the end, only3.9 million gallons of crude leaked, and most of that burnedin the holocaust or evaporated in the searing Texas sun. Anenvironmental disaster had been averted. This time.   &quot;There are problems at all levels of the oiltransportation system, including the design and constructionof the ships, control of traffic in the harbors, the trainingand competence of ship crews and the ability of theregulators to oversee the whole operation,&quot; declares PeterJohnson, senior associate of the Office of TechnologyAssessment in Washington.   What put the oil transport system on the rocks, expertssay, is a decade of corner-cutting driven by slumpingrevenues. As crude-oil prices crashed from $40 a barrel in1981 to as low as $10 five years later, the industry hackedspending, reduced tanker crews and began to stretchequipment. Excess capacity and collapsing revenues alsospurred independent tanker operators, who transport the bulkof the nation's crude, to delay maintenance and repairs, andto hire cheaper and fewer sailors.   Things are likely to get worse, too. Now demand for oiland tankers to move it is rebounding. Currently, an averageof 52 tankers a day deliver 462 million gallons of crude oil,gasoline and other petroleum products to U.S. ports, up from400 million gallons five years ago, the American PetroleumInstitute estimates. Because the U.S. is increasinglydependent on foreign oil, both numbers are rising steadily.   But the system is fatigued. Many ships are in poor shape,crews inadequate and practices sloppy. Industry expertsexpect accidents to increase right along with imports, andpossibly faster.   Many new ships are designed and built with less steel,which can make them more vulnerable than old ones. And somegovernment steps intended to prevent problems may haveactually made them worse.   &quot;The whole industry has changed and these people have tomodernize,&quot; insists Sen. Brock Adams, the Washington stateDemocrat who is pushing various tanker-related legislation.&quot;You now have such a massive world-wide movement of oil youhave to treat it as dangerous.&quot;   Industry officials don't wholly disagree. They too worryabout aging ships and human error by poorly qualified crewsand officers. &quot;There is room for considerable improvement,&quot;concedes Tormod Rafgard, managing director of theInternational Association of Independent Tanker Owners, atrade group in Norway. &quot;But it is exaggerated to say this isan unsafe system; 99.99% of the oil is coming in withoutproblems. It is a good system.&quot;   In fact, while definitive statistics on all tankertroubles aren't available, the number of large spills (10,000gallons or more) in the U.S. has held at six or seven a yearfor a decade, says Richard Golob, publisher of Golob's OilPollution Bulletin. But expectations of safety have risenmightily, especially since the Exxon Valdez dumped nearly 11million gallons of crude into cold Prince William Sound 15months ago.   &quot;The boundary between acceptable and nonacceptableaccidents has changed,&quot; says Terje Staalstrom, a manager forOslo-based det Norske Veritas, a ship classification society.   And during the '80s, the pressure to save money alsointensified. So upkeep of ships, new and old, has suffered.&quot;The majority of large tankers are out of date, over-age andin many cases poorly maintained,&quot; Paul Slater, chairman ofthe ship finance firm First International Financial Corp.,told a tanker conference in California last week.   A long period of depressed shipping rates that began inthe mid-1970s encouraged owners to postpone maintenance,particularly on idled vessels. By 1985, a typical large250,000-deadweight-ton tanker was fetching a spot charterrate of around $5,000 a day. But the bare-bones cost to runit was $6,000 to $7,000 a day, says George Blake, a directorof Overseas Shipholding Group.   Even today's day rates for large tankers of close to$30,000 are $10,000 below what's needed to justify replacingan old ship with a new one, says the tanker-owner tradegroup. So, says the group's Mr. Rafgard, while the &quot;tankerfleet is getting older, this problem certainly will notdisappear.&quot;   Some of the ship classification societies that inspectvessels before they can be insured now are cracking down. &quot;Wedeleted four ships in April due to overdue maintenance ornoncompliance with requirements, and we deleted 24 in March,&quot;says Mr. Staalstrom of det Norske Veritas. &quot;I'm not afraid ofold ships. I'm afraid of a management that isn't taking careof its ships,&quot; he says. &quot;You have accidents.&quot;   While the cause of the Mega Borg fire is still unknown, aninquiry has turned up 14 pieces of equipment or parts of theship overdue for maintenance and inspections. In the pumproom, where the fire may have begun and traditionally one ofthe most dangerous areas of a tanker, oil may have beenleaking from a gauge, according to testimony at aninvestigatory hearing. The captain, C.M. Mahidhara, told thepanel the ship was operating with a cracked storage tank.   New tankers ought to be less troublesome, but that may notbe so. In recent years, large tankers have been built with10% less steel. Architects have tried to compensate for thelighter weight with computer-aided design, high-strengthsteel and improved coatings to protect the thinner metal fromcracking and corrosion.   Some experts endorse such designs. &quot;Before, we had to putin more steel because we weren't quite sure how close to thelimit we were,&quot; says Garry Beaumont, chief ship surveyor ofLloyd's Register of Shipping, a London-basedship-classification society. But he concedes thatstrong-but-thin steel &quot;will age faster and use up itscorrosion resistance quicker,&quot; and he frets that the nextgeneration of tankers is being designed with even less steel.   Some are outraged by use of thinner steel. Modern tankersare &quot;flimsy and have too narrow a margin for error,&quot; saysArthur McKenzie, director of the Tanker Advisory Center inNew York and a former Exxon Corp. shipping executive. LloydBergeson, a retired naval architect, says modern tankers maybe &quot;perfectly adequate in strength to withstand buffeting byocean waves, but when they hit the ground they don't have thestrength to withstand the impact.&quot;   Mr. Bergeson labels the Exxon Valdez, launched in 1986, anexample of &quot;a modern ship that has been cost-engineered toofar.&quot; Another naval architect contends that the Valdez andExxon Long Beach, its sister ship, have the least steelweight for their size of any U.S. tanker.   Exxon defends the Long Beach and the Valdez, saying theValdez hit Bligh Reef so hard that even a double hull likethose now urged in some quarters would have torn.   In any case, an internal Coast Guard tanker studycommissioned after that spill reveals a &quot;significant numberof failures in ships over 700 feet in length and less than 15years old.&quot; In particular, tankers on Alaskan runs &quot;wereexperiencing a significant number of serious structuralfailures&quot; that had frequently resulted &quot;in significant lossof cargo,&quot; the study says.   Quality of construction in newer vessels is also aproblem, the Coast Guard says, so it is increasinginspections of some U.S. tankers. &quot;We found that theworkmanship in the shipyards with high-tensile steel was notas good,&quot; says Adm. Joel D. Sipes, chief of the agency'sOffice of Marine Safety, Security and EnvironmentalProtection. He says shipbuilders have difficulty welding thematerial, and often internal framework is improperlydesigned.   Three months before the Exxon Valdez spill, oil wasdiscovered leaking one night from a tanker called theThompson Pass while it was loading crude at the Port ofValdez. Some 71,000 gallons spilled, most of which wasrecovered. Divers discovered three long fractures in theship's bottom plating, according to an Alaskanwater-pollution report. It concluded that fractures in theThompson Pass, built in 1978, were &quot;most probably a result oforiginal construction heat-treatment procedures, plus nineyears of North Pacific operations.&quot;   Says William Lockwood, president of Interocean ManagementCorp. of Philadelphia, manager of the ship: &quot;We have had aproblem with the design and have taken steps to correct it&quot;by adding structural members to alleviate stresses.   Another big problem with tanker transport is that manyvessels now operate with a third less personnel than a decadeago. &quot;We have seen a dramatic decline in the size of crews,and critical tasks are falling to a very few number ofpeople,&quot; says John Bobb, of the Maritime Institute ofTechnology Graduate Studies, which trains officers inLinthicum Heights, Md. &quot;Fatigue is beginning to take itstoll,&quot; he says.   In its report following the Exxon Valdez spill, the CoastGuard devotes an entire section to oil-tanker crew fatigueand manning problems. Sixteen-hour work days are common, itsays. Coast Guard inspectors tell of talking to chief matesimmediately after their arrival in port to set up inspectionschedules. &quot;Some mates were so exhausted that they fellasleep during these meetings,&quot; the report says.   Aboard the Union Oil Co. tanker Coast Range, &quot;a lot ofmachinery is not taken care of because we have no time,&quot; saysboatswain George Lua. &quot;There aren't enough people. There'sjust too much work.&quot; The ship, which makes frequent stopsbetween Puget Sound and Los Angeles, &quot;is in and out of portso much that we are too busy hooking up hoses and tying upthe ship, docking and undocking,&quot; to do regular maintenance,Mr. Lua says.   A Unocal spokesman dismisses Mr. Lua's grievances as a&quot;standard seaman's complaint.&quot; The spokesman says, &quot;You'llget that comment from any seaman that there isn't enough timeto do the work.&quot; He says the Coast Range is a modern,well-maintained, double-bottom tanker.   A short-handed and exhausted crew on the Greek tankerWorld Prodigy contributed to the spill last June of 290,000gallons of oil into Narragansett Bay, according to a suitfiled against the ship's owners by Rhode Island. The weatherwas clear and the seas tranquil that afternoon. But CaptainIakovas Georgoudis had been working almost nonstop for a fullday and a half before the ship hit a reef, he told a NationalTransportation Safety Board hearing.   Then the half-hour preceding the accident turned hectic.   The World Prodigy was informed it would unload at twoports instead of one. As the tanker approached thehard-to-navigate shoreline, the captain testified, the chiefofficer went below to calculate what the ship's new distancefrom the ocean floor would be following the discharge of someof its cargo. As the only officer on the bridge, the captainbecame lookout and navigator. He had to make sure his orderswere carried out, and he had to plot positions on navigationcharts. When the chief officer returned with incorrectcalculations, the captain started redoing the math himself.As a local harbor pilot was about to board, the World Prodigyhit a reef.   Thomas H. Walsh Jr., an attorney for the World Prodigy(which is managed by International Maritime Agencies Co. ofAthens), argues that the ship had the full complement ofseamen required for vessels flying the Greek flag. Thecaptain, he maintains, wasn't fatigued because he had beenable to take naps on a cot on the bridge. The suit ispending.   Tankers face some of their biggest risks pulling in andout of port, since the ports themselves have changed littlewhile ships have grown. Some lanes in the Houston ShipChannel, connecting the city's port to the Gulf of Mexico 50miles away, are so tight that when two vessels approach eachother, one has to give way and risk grounding along the side.Local seamen call the process &quot;Texas Chicken.&quot;   Last summer's Rachel B incident in the channel occurredwhen the Rachel B was trying to avoid a jutting sandbank. Hadthe channel been dredged, &quot;this accident most probably wouldnot have happened,&quot; the Coast Guard says.   Giant tankers too big to come into most ports pose otherproblems. They anchor at sea and pump their cargo intosmaller vessels that can dock. The practice, called&quot;lightering,&quot; is what the Mega Borg was doing when itexploded. The oil industry estimates giant oceangoing tankerslighter between 42 million gallons and 63 million of crudedaily off the U.S. coastline, and the amount is increasing asimports rise. Lightering entails risks of a collision inaddition to pump, hose or other problems that could cause aspill. Shipping executives insist there's little hazard.   Dave Caldow, Chevron Corp.'s assistant fleet manager and aformer captain of a vessel lightering between the Gulf ofMexico and a port in Pascagoula, Miss., says all 16 years thecompany has operated there have been incident-free.   As was the case with the Mega Borg, most lightering occursbeyond the 12-mile limit of U.S. waters, which basically putsany foreign-flagged vessels involved beyond the reach of U.S.law. &quot;You don't have the Coast Guard on top of you,&quot; saysGary Gehring, an instructor at the U.S. Merchant MarineAcademy in New York.   Even in the U.S., much of the oversight -- that pertainingto construction and maintenance -- is in the hands ofclassification societies, which are paid by ship owners toprove their vessels are worthy of insurance. But thecredibility of these organizations is under attack.   They've become &quot;immersed in a bitter competitive battle toclass ships,&quot; says Harry Keefe, chairman of the AmericanInstitute of Marine Underwriters. &quot;This has had a big impacton their effectiveness. Some ship owners want to go with thesociety that will cost them the least.&quot; Now some Scandinavianinsurance underwriters are establishing their own corps ofship inspectors to avoid reliance on the societies.   Foreign tankers that never enter U.S. waters need noinsurance for oil spills. If they cross the territorialboundary they must post bond with the Coast Guard based ontheir size, but it's a minimum. For instance, though it hadsome $700 million of insurance, the Mega Borg legally had tohave just $10.3 million, insufficient for a major cleanup.   Current law puts all the liability on the tanker owner,not on the owner of the oil it's carrying. Congress isconsidering whether also to make the owner of the oilpartially liable.   Congress is also considering raising minimum liabilityinsurance levels and setting maximums, a move opposed by manyin the oil industry. &quot;As you continue to raise liabilityrequirements and punishments, you're going to have goodoperators say it's not worth putting myself in jeopardy,&quot;says Jerry Aspland, president of Atlantic Richfield Co.'smarine subsidiary.   ARCO plans to stop transporting other companies' oil onits tankers through Cook Inlet, Alaska, because of spillliability fears. And already, one of the world's largest oilcompanies, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is curbing the number ofits ships in U.S. waters and will hire more independentsinstead.   The most controversial solution has been the push fordouble hulls. Proponents argue that by adding a second,protective hull on the bottom and sides of a tanker, spillsfrom groundings and collisions might be reduced.   Critics -- and there are many among oil executives -- sayany extra protection isn't worth the expense, though it'sunclear what that would be. Some advocates say a double hulladds 5% and 8% to the cost of a new $90 million tanker builtin a Far Eastern shipyard. But others advocate designs thatcould raise costs as much as 25%. Opponents also argue thatdouble-hulled tankers face a greater risk of losing bouyancyafter a severe grounding, complicating salvage efforts.   Some propose more offshore unloading facilities like thegiant Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, a platform 19 miles offthe coast but designated by law as a U.S. port. Tankersunload about 42 million gallons of crude a day that moves toshore via pipeline. Built by five oil companies for about$800 million, the facility says it has had no major spill inits eight years of operation. Advocates say if there wereone, it would be a long way from beaches.   Phillips Petroleum Co. says it and other companies arelooking at the idea of building such a port off Texas. Costestimates range from $500 million to $1 billion. That'ssubstantially less, proponents note, than the more than $2billion Exxon has spent so far for its Alaskan cleanup.   ---           The Perils of Transporting Oil by Sea                                                                                                          Among the most common problems and mishaps facing oiltankers:                                                                                                          -- Fires and Explosion. These can happen at almost anystage of a tanker's journey but are most likely when thetanks are empty (the ballast voyage). Fumes trapped in thetanks are ignited by sparks generated by the cleaningprocess. Vapors can also build up in the pump room, which mayhave been the case in the Mega Borg spill.                                                                                                          -- Collisions at the entrance to or in ports. In thecollision of the Phillips Oklahoma and another ship in theRiver Humber, England, in September 1989, its side tanks werepenetrated and it lost 750 tons of crude oil.                                                                                                          -- Breakups in heavy weather. In 1988-89 three tankers --the Athenian Venture, carrying 30,000 tons of products, theOdyssey, carrying 130,000 tons of oil, and the Maasguar,carrying 30,000 tons of chemicals -- all sank fully loaded,with the loss of all 79 crew members.                                                                                                          -- Running Aground while entering or leaving ports. Thishas caused many spills including the disastrous Exxon Valdezspill in March 1989.                                                                                                          -- Overflows while loading or discharging oil. In August1989 the Minerva over-filled tanks and discharged 2 tons ofcrude into the Delaware River.                                                                                                          -- Hull Cracks, especially on large American tankersmaking the Alaska run. In January 1989 the hull of the CoveLeader cracked while loading in Alaska, spilling 10 tons ofcrude.                                                                                                          -- Poor Maintenance and poor design. These may havecontributed to the loss of a plate on the Pacificos, whichspilled 10,000 tons of oil off the coast of Africa in October1989.                                                                                                          -- Contact Damage. Hitting the dock or another ship canrupture the hull. In 1989 the Stolt Sea was hit while mooredat Avondale, La., on the Mississippi River, losing 200 tonsof bunker fuel oil.
