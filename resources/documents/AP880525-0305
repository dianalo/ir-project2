Gorbachev, the reform-minded son of asouthern Russian peasant, is redefining what the world expects fromthe Soviet Union and from the man who leads it.   This 57-year-old law school graduate and career communist hasturned a half-century of Soviet economic orthodoxy on its head bypraising individual enterprise and profitability, and relaxingbureaucratic controls on managers and workers alike.   Unlike his predecessors, this Kremlin leader preaches hisreformist brand of socialism with a mix of fiery conviction andMadison Avenue flare. Whether he is facing foreign journalistsquestioning him about human rights, bantering with peasants on acollective farm or inviting American schoolchildren to the Kremlin,Gorbachev seems at home with himself and his role as generalsecretary of the Communist Party.   He says he seeks a new working relationship with the UnitedStates and the West that will decrease global tensions and allowthe Soviet Union to turn more resources from the military sector todeveloping the country's stagnant civilian economy.   When he greets President Reagan on Sunday for their fourthsummit meeting, Gorbachev will be hoping to further his owndomestic agenda as well as foreign policy goals, such as a 50percent cut in strategic nuclear arms.   Soviet foreign policy, he has said, ``is more than everdetermined by domestic policy, by our interest in concentrating onconstructive endeavors to improve our country. This is why we needlasting peace, predictability and constructiveness in internationalrelations.''   Since March 1985, when he became Soviet leader, Gorbachev'sachievements in the foreign policy field have been far moretangible than progress in the titanic task he has set for himselfin reviving his country's economy and modernizing its socialstructure.   At the Washington summit last December, Gorbachev and Reagansigned a treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, the firstsuperpower pact in history that mandates the scrapping of an entirecategory of weapons.   On May 15, the first units of a Soviet force estimated at115,000 troops returned home from Afghanistan. The Soviet militaryintervention in support of a socialist regime in that neighboringcountry had been an irritant in U.S.-Soviet relations for more thaneight years.   At home, Gorbachev is pursuing reforms that dismantle much ofthe top-heavy bureaucracy that has micromanaged the Soviet economysince the reign of dictator Josef V. Stalin. This renunciation oflong-standing socialist orthodoxy, plus the Kremlin's ``glasnost''campaign for more openness and criticism, has left many Sovietsbewildered.   ``Some people have indeed lost their bearings amid all theseprocesses under way,'' Gorbachev acknowledged earlier this month.``Some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked.''   Gorbachev can be charming or tough, philosophical ordown-to-earth, solemn or jovial. But his message to his countrymenis usually the same: The country must modernize quickly and workharder, or it will squander the gains of 70 years of socialism.   ``The reorganization which we have launched ... this is where wewant to direct our resources, this is where our thoughts are going,these are our actual programs and intentions, on this we intend tospend the intellectual energy of our society,'' he has said.   In November, Gorbachev proved his toughness by firing MoscowParty chief Boris N. Yeltsin, a former protege who criticized theslow pace of the reforms at a closed meeting of the partyleadership. But rather than thrust Yeltsin into the utter obscurityusually reserved for fallen officials, Gorbachev has appointed himto a high post in the housing bureacracy.   When widespread demonstrations broke out in the Armenian capitalof Yerevan in February calling for the annexation of a part ofneighboring Azerbaijan, Gorbachev temporarily defused ethnictensions by issuing an unprecedented personal appeal for calm.   In late June, Gorbachev is expected to use a special nationwideparty conference, the first since 1941, to set his stamp even morefirmly on the party by ousting communists who oppose or areindifferent to his drive for ``perestroika,'' or economic andsocial restructuring.   Like most of his predecessors, Gorbachev rose to the Kremlinfrom humble origins.   Born March 2, 1931, to a peasant family in the farming region ofStavropol between the Black and Caspian seas, Gorbachev startedwork as a laborer on a tractor station when he was 15.   Little is known about his early years or his life during theNazi occupation of southern Russia during World War II. Gorbachev'smother still reportedly lives in the village of Privolnoye where hewas born.   In 1950, Gorbachev was among the members of the Komsomol YoungCommunist League chosen because of academic ability andworking-class origins to study at the prestigious Moscow StateUniversity.   It was there he met Raisa Titorenko, an auburn-haired studentfrom Siberia whom he married in 1954, and whose glamor and witwould later help him give the Soviet Union a new image abroad.   In 1955, Gorbachev graduated with a law degree and he returnedto his native Stavropol region to begin a succession of Komsomoland Communist Party jobs. In 1970, at age 39, he was named partyfirst secretary in the grain-growing region, becoming Moscow'sviceroy in an area the size of South Carolina.   In 1979, under then-President Leonid I. Brezhnev, Gorbachev wasbrought to Moscow to take charge of the nation's problem-plaguedfarm sector. His inability to produce any visible improvement infood supplies had no apparent effect on his party standing.   Once in the Soviet capital, Gorbachev quickly widened hisinfluence, becoming a candidate member on the ruling Politburo in1979 and a full, voting member the next year.   After the death in 1984 of Brezhnev's successor, Yuri V.Andropov, who was believed to be grooming Gorbachev for top-levelresponsibilities, Gorbachev reportedly acquiesced in the choice ofKonstantin U. Chernenko for the Soviet leadership.   But by the time the ailing Chernenko died in March 1985,Gorbachev had been dubbed the party's ``second secretary'' by aSoviet editor and was running meetings of the ruling Politburo.   Within hours of Chernenko's passing, Gorbachev was named partygeneral secretary, becoming, at age 54, the youngest Kremlin leadersince Stalin.   In his first months in power, Gorbachev moved quickly to chart aprogram of economic modernization, decreed an anti-drinkingcampaign, proclaimed the Kremlin's desire to scrap all nuclearweapons by the year 2000 and had to deal with history's worstnuclear power accident when an explosion and fire ruptured areactor at the Chernobyl power plant in the Ukraine in April 1986.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs Fri May 27 and thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
