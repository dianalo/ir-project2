Students staged demonstrations and marches today at colleges inSeoul and other cities to demand the overthrow of President RohTae-woo and removal of U.S. troops. Many protests were peaceful,but some turned into battles with police in green combat fatiguesand black-visored helmets.   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``Drive out theYankee imperialists!'' protesters shouted.   Students hurling firebombs and rocks battled police around atleast three colleges in Seoul and one in the southern city ofKwangju.   Police fired tear gas and formed walls of shields to stopprotesters from marching into the streets.   Eight students were arrested today in Suwon, south of Seoul,when they stormed an office of the governing Democratic JusticeParty with firebombs and sticks. Riot police overpowered theattackers.   Students carrying a South Korean flag and banners denouncing thegovernment and the United States scaled the walls of the U.S.Embassy compound and others rushed the gate, police said.   They threw six bombs at police guards. One officer was hurt whenfour of the devices exploded. The officer was hospitalized withwounds, police said.   The intruders ran around the embassy compound for severalminutes, shouting ``Drive out the U.S.!'' and scattering leafletsbefore riot police overpowered and arrested seven protesters.Witnesses said some of the protesters got away.   The state-run Korean Broadcast System said one student wasinjured by a policeman armed with an iron bar, but police said theycould not confirm the report.   U.S. Embassy officials said the bombs did not damage thebuilding and no American personnel was hurt. Police said the bombswere crude chemical explosives packed in soft drink cans.   Radical groups called for a march in Seoul on Saturday todenounce the government. Opposition church groups also called forpeaceful protests.   Police remained on nationwide alert, and riot squads stood guardat key locations in Seoul or waited out of sight in side streets.   Protesters have denounced the United States in demonstrationsthis week, charging that Washington supports military dictatorshipin South Korea.   Leaders of the radical students, who represent an importantcampus minority, want Seoul to end its alliance with Washington andexpel the 40,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.   On Thursday, protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs atthe Seoul office of the U.S. Information Agency. The center wasseized in February by radicals who exploded several bombs thatcaused minor damage.   Radical groups reject broad democratic reforms made by the Rohgovernment since it took power in February. They contend SouthKorea is not a democracy and demand a nationwide revolt.   Many Koreans distrust Roh because of the role he played in theauthoritarian government of former President Chun Doo-hwan, whom hesucceeded.Roh narrowly won the presidency in a December electoralvictory over two candidates who split the opposition vote.   This week's political violence has been the worst sincenationwide riots last summer. In major clashes in Seoul and othercities, thousands of students and dissidents threw firebombs androcks at riot police, who used volleys of tear gas to scatter theprotesters.   The protests this week were called to mark the anniversary of ananti-government uprising in Kwangju on May 18, 1980.   Some opposition groups contend Roh, as a top general then,played a leading role in the bloody suppression of the Kwangjuuprising, in which at least 191 people were killed. Radicals demandthat Roh be punished for the incident.</TEXT></DOC>
