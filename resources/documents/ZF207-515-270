(NCI)of Berkeley Calif., and Dynamics Research of Andover, Mass.andM;Unlike Oracle, the only database product IBS supports is the Oracle RDBMS,but IBS officials are considering support for other products such as DEC'sRdb.andM;&quot;One of the strengths is that IBS supports only Oracle, which is one reasonwe chose them first [for a marketing agreement],&quot; Cheu said.andM;Prices for EasyTalk range from $21,500 to $175,000.andM;Intelligent Business Systems is located at Milford Place Corporate Center,185 Plains Road, Milford, CT 06460, (203) 878-7960.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
