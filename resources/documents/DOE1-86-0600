<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-0600 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple method to construct modified electronic charge densities in solids,rho/sub s/(r), from their free-atomic charge densities, rho/sub F/(r),is described. Atomic scattering factors of seven elements representingfour different crystal structures, and energy of formation of seventeenCsCl-type intermetallic compounds of transition metals are calculatedfrom such rho/sub s/(r). Results thus obtained compare well with thoseobtained earlier from superposition of rho/sub F/(r) through Loewdin's{alpha}-expansion.</TEXT></DOC>
