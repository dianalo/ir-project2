(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Heritage USA, the booming resort that grewfrom Jim Bakker's fund-raising talents, hangs on in the shadow ofits glory days, before the TV evangelist resigned and was indictedon fraud and conspiracy charges.   The Heritage Grand Hotel and the sprawling water park remainopen. They are bordered by the half-finished spectres of a 20-storyhotel and the fiberglass turrets and towers of a hamburger castle.   There's no longer enough traffic to wear down the grass that popsthrough the concrete of the massive parking lot at the water park. Agiant crane looms over the unfinished hotel, shadowing the shops ofMain Street USA, Heritage's indoor shopping mall.   ``Used to be, you couldn't even get a seat in here,'' said KenDaneilson of Turlock, Calif., as he watched a handful of shoppersdrift along Main Street. ``Whenever a service would let out orsomething else was going on, you could forget about getting into theice cream shop over there.''   Bakker envisioned Heritage USA as a retreat for Christians thatwould feature family entertainment and religious services.   Now it's owned by a Canadian developer and Bakker goes on trialMonday. Prosecutors say he and other PTL executives used at least $4million of the $158 million they raised through ``lifetimepartnerships'' in the ministry to pay for their own luxuriouslifestyles.   Danielson was one of those who donated at least $1,000 to Bakkerfor a partnership in 1984 in exchange for three nights lodging ayear at Heritage USA for the rest of his life. Several hotels wereproposed, but the Heritage Grand Hotel was the only one finished andopened.   Danielson soon switched his partnership from the uncompletedtowers to the Heritage Grand Hotel. The switch meant he got to usehis partnership, unlike many others.   ``I felt like I got my money's worth out of it,'' said Danielson.``I switched that first year and then came at least two more years.With rooms running $90 or $100 a night, it worked out about even.''   Danielson said he had not been to Heritage USA in a couple ofyears, and he could immediately see a difference.   ``All the limousines are gone from the front of the hotel,'' hesaid. ``They used to be all over the place out here. Every day we'dsee Jim Bakker pull in with his limousine and chauffeur.''   The Bakkers' likenesses are virtually absent from the shops alongMain Street. A small table in the Victor Music Shoppe held bookswritten by Jim and his wife, Tammy Faye, which were once used aspremiums for faithful contributors. Tuesday, they were on sale at 75percent off the retail price.   Records by Tammy Faye and her daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, wereselling for as little as 98 cents.   Manuel Cantu Sr., who owns a snack bar on Main Street, saw theend of PTL's heyday. ``I got this just two weeks before it allstarted to unravel,'' Cantu said, referring to Bakker's resignationin March 1987. ``It's been kind of tough.''   Cantu said the former owners, who also operated the ice creamshop and popcorn stand, did $10,000 worth of business on a Fourth ofJuly four or five years ago.   ``Ten thousand dollars in a single day, can you believe it?''asked Cantu, who lives on the Heritage USA grounds and also works asan evangelist helping refugees from Central America.   ``That's how busy it used to be around here,'' he said. ``Therewere so many people you could hardly move.   ``Now, it's OK on weekends, but hardly anybody during the week,''he said. ``There's a healing conference going on this week, so youhave maybe 40, 50, 60 people here for that. That's helped pick it upa little, but it's not like it was.   ``And I honestly doubt if it ever will be again.''</TEXT></DOC>
