At an extraordinary meeting of shareholders called to set up a new management structure for the big Belgian holding company, Mr. De Benedetti will propose as board members Peter Cohen, chairman and chief executive officer of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of the U.S. and Rene Thomas, chairman of France's largest commerical bank, Banque Nationale de Paris.    Mr. De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist and financier, also will propose himself and Alain Minc, managing director of Cerus S.A., the French holding company through which Mr. De Benedetti controls 16% of Generale de Belgique.    The nominations and the creation of a new, more modern management structure to be unveiled today seal the power-sharing agreement reached in June between Mr. De Benedetti and a rival Franco-Belgian consortium led by Cie. Financiere de Suez, ending their battle for control of the Belgian holding company.    As part of that agreement, Mr. De Benedetti will be named vice chairman of Generale de Belgique and will control three other seats on the board of about 20 members. The exact number of board members won't be known until today, when several board members are expected to announce their retirement.    The meeting also will set up a three-tiered management structure giving more power to the shareholders. Frenchman Herve de Carmoy, who is to be appointed managing director, will be in charge of day-to-day management.    A spokesman for Cerus said Mr. De Benedetti asked the two outsiders to represent him on the board to bring greater international prestige and financial clout to Generale de Belgique and to signal his seriousness about making the underperforming company successful.    But it is unclear whether the two new outsiders will see eye-to-eye with Suez and its allies.    Shearson, long an ally of Mr. De Benedetti, played a critical role in his attempt to win control of Generale de Belgique. Shearson also is a shareholder in both Cerus and Cofide, Mr. De Benedetti's Italian holding company.    State-owned BNP, headed by Mr. Thomas, also is a Cerus shareholder and is Mr. De Benedetti's banker. Mr. Thomas's appearance on the board could signal a new cooperation between two French financial giants struggling to reinforce their European positions before 1992, when the European Community hopes to dismantle internal trade barriers, analysts said.    Mr. Thomas has said that the state-controlled bank will try to link itself with other international banking groups and expand its operations through acquisition.    Mr. Cohen also has been trying to play a bigger international role. Shearson has been moving into Europe and Asia in anticipation of faster growth there than in the U.S. Mr. Cohen's seat on the Generale de Belgique board could help advance his goal to increase Shearson's business abroad. </TEXT></DOC>
