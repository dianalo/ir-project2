In the investigationconducted in 1983, Rumoi in Hokkaido was selected as a typical strong-windseashore area in Japan. For 3 months, wind condition was observed inupper atmosphere and at 10 m above from the ground. In addition, costof a large wind power generation system was analyzed on the basis ofthe data obtained through designing and elaborating the 100 kW classpilot plant. The results of the wind condition observation showed thatthe percentage of appearance of wind speeds available for wind powergeneration is estimated to be 60% to 65% on the assumption that the cut-in,cut-out, and stational tower wind speeds are 5.0, 18.0, and 10.0 m/s,respectively. The percentage of appearance of the stationary tower windspeed is 20% to 33%. The results of the cost analysis showed that therated power and rotor diameter most suitable for LWECS are 3000 kW and80 to 90 m, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
