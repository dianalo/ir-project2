The AD required a daily inspectionof the main rotor (M/R) yoke. The AD was necessary to prevent helicoptersfrom flying with a crack in the M/R yoke.

The AD was prompted by a report of a fatiguecrack originating under the flapping bearing pillow block bushing flange.Investigation of the M/R yoke revealed that the crack was a result of fatigueinitiated by fretting between the M/R yoke and the flapping bearing pillowblock bushing. This crack, if undetected, could result in failure of theM/R yoke. AD action was necessary to prevent failure of the M/R Yoke, whichwould cause the loss of the M/R blade and subsequent loss of the helicopter.Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, noticeand public procedure thereon were impracticable and contrary to publicinterest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately byindividual letters, issued January 21, 1988, to all known U.S. owners andoperators of certain BHTI Model 222, 222B, and 222U helicopters. Theseconditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as an amendment to andSection; 39.13 of part 39of the Federal Aviation Regulations to make it effective as to all persons.The references to the BHTI Service Bulletins have been deleted from paragraph(a) of the AD, and the inspection instructions of the service documentshave been added explicitly to paragraph (a). A figure 1 has also been addedfor additional clarity.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of ExecutiveOrder 12291 with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediatelyto correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If it is determinedthat this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation willbe prepared and placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluationis not required).
