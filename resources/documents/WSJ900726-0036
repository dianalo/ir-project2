The rule, proposed by the New York Stock Exchange,probably would have slowed Monday's drop if it had been inplace, said Richard Ketchum, the agency's chief marketwatcher. &quot;The slope of the decline picked up&quot; Monday at thepoint where the Big Board's restriction would have kicked in,he said.</LP><TEXT>   Still, all four SEC commissioners expressed reservationsabout the rule. Moreover, the Commodity Futures TradingCommission worried in a letter to the SEC that the rule &quot;willdecrease the linkage between markets.&quot; Nonetheless, the SECunanimously voted to allow the Big Board to adopt the pilotplan for one year.   The SEC also voted to allow the introduction of a newproduct that will enable investors to protect themselves frommarket drops. The product, called SuperShares, was designedby Los Angeles investment firm Leland O'Brien Rubinstein Inc.to improve on the concept of portfolio insurance -- the nowalmost-defunct strategy that Leland O'Brien designed toprotect institutional investors in market declines.Regulators and others who analyzed the crash concluded thatit helped fuel the 508-point drop by the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage in the October 1987 crash.   SuperShares uses a complicated variation on mutual fundsto enable investors to bet on stock movements. One form ofSuperShares is tied to the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index,to allow investors to benefit from big rises in the stockmarket. Another kind uses money-market funds to let investorsbenefit from big drops. &quot;We don't know whether this productis going to be successful or not,&quot; said SEC Chairman RichardBreeden. But the commission decided to offer the choice tothe marketplace.   The Big Board rule will place severe restrictions onprogram trading whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Averagemoves up or down 50 or more points in a day. Specifically,the plan targets index arbitrage, a computerizedprogram-trading strategy that allows market players to takeadvantage of small price differences between a basket ofstocks and a stock-index futures contract. That contract,traded on a commodity exchange, allows investors to bet onthe movement of a stock basket without owning the stocks.   Index arbitrage has been blamed for exacerbating sharpmarket moves. But the new rule will force traders to wait for&quot;upticks&quot; in stock prices before completing the stock side oftheir transaction in a market falling by more than 50 points.That means firms would be taking market risk while they arewaiting for stocks to move up. It is expected that many firmswon't do index-arbitrage trades if they can't be assured ofcompleting the transaction with a rapid-fire trade.   SEC officials emphasized that the rule wouldn't prohibitindex arbitrage. &quot;Index arbitrage becomes riskier, but it canbe done,&quot; Mr. Ketchum said. He suggested that it would induceprogram traders to reduce the size of their trades, so theycould take less market risk.   The Big Board rule would be triggered an average of once amonth, the SEC said. The restriction would be unwound if theDow industrials move to within 25 points of the prior day'sclosing level. The Big Board first proposed the rule to kickin after a 35-point move, but revised it after SEC complaintsthat it was too restrictive.   Still, each SEC commissioner in turn expressed concernthat the 50-point level would be reached too frequently andthat placing roadblocks to index arbitrage could add risk tothe markets. The agency's chief economist, Kenneth Lehn, toldthe commission that the impact on the futures and optionsmarkets could be dangerous, and recommended the SEC &quot;send theexchange back to the drawing board&quot; for more economicanalysis.   Even Mr. Ketchum, the SEC market-regulation director whoadvocated approving the pilot program, suggested that he wasconcerned about &quot;de-linking the markets.&quot;   But Commissioner Edward Fleischman said the exchange&quot;should be allowed to make its own mistakes&quot; and learn fromthem.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION will allow untilAug. 22 for comment before granting final approval ofSuperShares, a product designed to give investors protectionfrom market drops. An article in yesterday's editions didn'tfully explain the agency's action.   (WSJ July 27, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
