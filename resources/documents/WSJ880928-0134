Browning (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP FREST </CO><IN> MON ARO TEL </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   France and Britain are pressing for sharp reductions in controls on sensitive technological exports to China at a meeting of experts from the main Western countries here this week, sources said.    These sources said that resistance from the U.S. and West Germany probably will prevent a sudden easing of export controls for China. But the British and French hope eventually that they and other Western nations will be able to export to China much as they would to any developing country.    &quot;The process is slow, but it is moving ahead,&quot; said one source here, who, as is customary on the subject of export controls, declined to be identified.    This week's meeting is one of a series on China being held by Cocom, the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, which includes the U.S., Japan and most major Western European countries. Having concluded that China poses a reduced threat to the West, Cocom members in 1985 decided to permit broader equipment sales to the Beijing government than they do to the Soviet Union and its East European allies.    Early last year, in a secret meeting here, sources say France proposed a sweeping end to export controls on China, with just a short list of sophisticated military equipment continuing to be restricted. Other nations rejected the idea, but recently, these sources say, the United Kingdom adopted a position similar to France's. Unlike France, Britain still wants the restricted list to include some dual-use high-technology items in addition to purely military equipment.    &quot;The likelihood of technology exchanges between China and the Soviet Union seems to be nil at the moment,&quot; the source explained. The French and British want to sell the Chinese telecommunications equipment and missile guidance systems, among other items.    Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department announced substantial increases in the quality of communications systems that can be sold to China. For all types of transmission lines, the new data-transmitting limit is 140 million bits per second, up from earlier thresholds as low as 45 million bits per second.    Cocom members may sell China certain high-quality radio relay equipment and limited quantities of semiconductor lasers for use in civilian fiber-optic systems. Previously, exporters needed an exemption to sell such products to China.    Cocom was to discuss these issues a year ago, but the U.S. blocked the meeting to punish China for selling Silkworm missiles to Iran. Last July, the U.S. permitted the meetings to begin again, and members agreed to some liberalization, including that of numerical telephone exchanges. </TEXT></DOC>
