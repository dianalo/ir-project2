Well, please be seated.   I have a little statement here first I'd like to impose on you.   I'll _ this will be before taking questions.   Today's ceremonies, as you know, marked the end of my eightheconomic summit.   And over the years, I have come to regard the summit process asextremely important in forging a coordinated economic approach forthe United States and the other industrialized democracies.   It's helped return the nations represented here to steadygrowth, and helped to establish a consensus among us that only freeand open markets and only free and open societies foster economicprogress and opportunity.   Maybe one of the best ways to view these economic summits is tocompare discussions at them, whether heralded in our communiques ornot, with later results.   For example, our 1981 communique from Ottawa said: The primarychallenge we addressed at this meeting was the need to revitalizethe economies of the industrial democracies.   Revitalization, of course, has been achieved, in part, becausethe common commitment at Ottawa inaugurated a search for consensuson how to work together to release the productive energies of ourpeoples.   And today, gross national products are growing, as areemployment numbers and real personal incomes.   Our economic expansion in the United States got the ball rollingand helped crystalize the new consensus.   And now, everyone is part of the act.   To take another example, in our 1986 Tokyo economic communique,we said: There should be close and continuous coordination ofeconomic policy among the seven summit countries.   Today, policy coordination is a major pillar of the economicpolicies of all our countries.   It's a significant reason why the world market in stabilizes oflast October _ or instabilities, I should say _ of last October hadso little impact on our underlying economies.   The summit in Tokyo gave the political push that ensured thatthe fledgling process of coordination grew strong and robust.   So here we are, celebrating this summit with a measure of pride.   Some significant items are still in need of attention, but allin all, how things have changed over the years.   The economies of the summit countries have come roaring back,driven by a common commitment to replace government control withmarket-oriented policies.   These summits are building blocks for tomorrow.   Goals we set in earlier years have borne fruit.   I believe that the goals we're setting now will become thelandmarks for the future.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
