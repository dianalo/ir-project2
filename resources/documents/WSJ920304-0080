Westinghouse acquired furniture maker Knoll Internationalin August 1990, from 21 International Holdings Inc. in astock swap valued at $115 million. 21 International, a NewYork industrial holding company whose principal shareholderis Marshall Cogan, claims it lost about $45 million afterselling Knoll for 3.2 million shares of Westinghouse commonat $35.66 a share. 21 International subsequently sold all itsWestinghouse shares in 1991 for a total of $70 million,reflecting a sharp decline in the stock price.</LP><TEXT>   A Westinghouse spokesman called the suits, filed inPennsylvania and Texas, &quot;totally without merit.&quot;Westinghouse, in turn, has sued 21 International, alleging,among other things, that it is owed about $19 million incosts incurred after the deal closed. 21 Internationaldeclined to comment.   In the suits, 21 International alleges &quot;an abundance ofmisrepresentations, both affirmative and by omission&quot; indocuments Westinghouse provided in the course of thetransaction. The suits allege that Westinghouse understatedthe extent of problems in the real estate portfolio of itsfinancial services unit. Those problems forced Westinghouseto take $2.6 billion in pretax charges in the fourth quarterof 1990 and the 1991 third quarter.   Overall, Westinghouse stock has taken a beating since theKnoll transaction. Recently, however, the stock hasexperienced an upswing. In New York Stock Exchange compositetrading yesterday afternoon, Westinghouse was quoted at$20.50, up 25 cents.   While 21 International's main property is Foamex LP, amaker of polyurethane foam for the automobile industry, thecompany is best known for its 21 Club, a posh New Yorkrestaurant.   Westinghouse doubled the size of its furniture unit whenit acquired Knoll International, which had $380 million insales in 1990. However, the furniture business has been hurtby a decline in construction of new office buildings andresidential housing.   As to which party got the worst end of the transaction,Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with County NatWestSecurities, says that &quot;in the short run, it's been less amistake for Westinghouse than for Knoll. But in the long run,neither will look back on this with relish.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
