A federal grand jury in Atlanta is investigating whetherCargill, the nation's largest privately held company,violated the Trading with the Enemy Act for its role in a1988 sale of Cuban sugar to Venezuela.</LP><TEXT>   The sale was uncovered at the outset of an 18-monthgovernment investigation into activities of the Atlantaoffice of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro -- what AttorneyGeneral Richard Thornburgh calls an &quot;internationalwhite-collar scam with dire global consequences.&quot;   Starting in 1984, according to investigators, BNL'sAtlanta bank extended more than $4 billion in credit -- mostof it unauthorized -- to cash-short Baghdad, including $1.9billion in loans guaranteed by the Agriculture Departmentunder its commodity export credit programs. A lot of themoney is believed to have financed Saddam Hussein's militarybuildup.   But the investigation has so far yielded what manycongressional Democrats regard as meager results: Late lastmonth, the grand jury indicted 10 defendants, including threeformer BNL employees, but the only company named was anobscure Turkish trading company. &quot;To be sure, these weren'tthe only hands that got dirty,&quot; asserts Rep. Charles Rose(D., N.C.), chairman of a House Agriculture subcommittee thatis investigating the scandal.   The result has been intense pressure on the JusticeDepartment to take corporate scalps. And of all the companiesthat dealt with BNL's Atlanta bank, Cargill now appears thelikeliest target for charges.   In the fall of 1989, the Treasury Department's office offoreign-assets control concluded that the Cuban sugar sale bya Cargill unit, Cargill International S.A., of Geneva,Switzerland, violated regulations under the Trading with theEnemy Act. For months, attorneys for Cargill have been tryingto persuade federal prosecutors otherwise, wrangling over howthe act and highly complex trade regulations should beinterpreted -- and enforced.   In the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka, a Cargillspokesman says the company remains &quot;convinced there wasn'tany violation of law on our part.&quot; Even so, Cargill appearsto be preparing for the worst. Edward Garland, a prominentAtlanta criminal-defense lawyer, has been hired as Cargill'slocal counsel.   According to the indictment that has been already handedup in the BNL case, Cargill International was licensed totrade in Cuban sugar, but only if the transactions didn'tinvolve bankers or Cargill employees in the U.S. Theindictment, however, charges Christopher Drogoul, formermanager of BNL's Atlanta branch, with making three&quot;unlicensed and unauthorized&quot; payments totaling $7.8 millionto Cargill International after the Venezuelan governmentdefaulted on them.   In addition, it accuses Mr. Drogoul and a co-conspiratorof fabricating fake documents indicating that two shiploadsof sugar had sailed from Galveston, Texas, and a third fromMobile, Ala., when they originated in Cuban ports. Mr.Drogoul has denied any wrongdoing.   Paul Von Wedel, another former BNL officer who pleadedguilty to conspiracy and tax charges, has been cooperatingwith prosecutors. In a book manuscript, Mr. Von Wedelrecounts how, after Venezuela defaulted, he and Mr. Drogoultelephoned a sugar trader in Cargill's Minneapolisheadquarters to ask why Cargill didn't deal with &quot;morerespectable&quot; buyers.   The trader, Eduardo Vigil, &quot;started screaming that hehimself negotiated and signed the contracts and that he onlydeals with the best,&quot; Mr. Von Wedel writes in his manuscript.&quot;Then I asked him, `If you signed the contracts and theorigin was Cuban, isn't that against the law?' There wascomplete silence at the end of the (line).&quot;   Afterwards, Hubertus (Huub) Spierings, vice chairman ofCargill International in Geneva, flew to Atlanta to makeamends, says Mr. Von Wedel. Over dinner, he writes, &quot;Huubtold us not to blame (a Cargill International officer)because it was Minneapolis's sale and that Geneva'sinvolvement was just `cosmetic' because of the origin of themerchandise (Cuba).&quot;   Mr. Vigil, who left Cargill in December 1989, hasrepeatedly declined to comment on the allegations. TheCargill spokesman said Mr. Spierings wouldn't be availablefor comment.   &quot;Our review of all the details of the transactionindicates no improper involvement on the part of any of ouremployees,&quot; says Cargill's spokesman. &quot;This sale was carriedout by Cargill International in Geneva. Any other involvementby other persons was peripheral in nature and complied withall legal requirements.&quot;   The spokesman added that Cargill International &quot;was paidby BNL in Geneva in Swiss francs.&quot; The indictment says thepayments wired by BNL's Atlanta office to Geneva were in U.S.dollars, which the government alleges is an illegal transfer.   It remains to be seen whether the Justice Department willbe swayed by the argument that if Cargill erred, it wasmerely a technical violation of a law that some say has lostits relevance in an era when Castro's Cuba is no longer ageopolitical threat to the U.S.   But given the political climate, Justice officials don'tappear to be leaning toward leniency. Rep. Rose has alreadychastised them for negotiating plea bargains with severaltobacco exporters who used the Atlanta bank to financeexports to Iraq with Agriculture Department guarantees. WithIraq currently in default, the department stands to lose $347million on all the BNL loans, including tobacco.   Some lawmakers are skeptical of the Bush administration'seagerness to get to the bottom of a scandal that calls intoquestion the U.S. tilt toward Iraq during its eight-year warwith Iran as well as the wisdom of lavishing $5 billion inagricultural export credits on Baghdad right until theinvasion of Kuwait. House Banking Committee Chairman HenryGonzalez (D., Texas), for one, complains that the JusticeDepartment has thwarted his staff's investigative efforts byrefusing to turn over subpoeaned BNL-related documents.   The BNL affair, dubbed &quot;Iraqgate&quot; by the Italian media, isparticularly troubling to Farm Belt lawmakers who fear theagricultural export credit programs will be somehowdiscredited. Nonetheless, argues Sen. Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.):&quot;We can't be defensive about this; we can't be timid in thisinvestigation. . . . You don't pretend something bad didn'thappen if it did.&quot;   Justice officials deny any suggestions of a cover-up ordamage control to spare the Bush administration from possiblepolitical fallout. Some House Democrats are said to hope thescandal will eventually prove embarrassing to formerAgriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, the new RepublicanNational Committee chairman.   &quot;We have several questions as to why there's such a verylimited scope of people accused of wrongdoing,&quot; says Rep.Rose. &quot;I basically think this investigation is halffinished.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
