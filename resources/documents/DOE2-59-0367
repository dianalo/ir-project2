One of them has one group of the shim system; another has thethree groups on the every sector. The analytical expressions of the magneticfield for the structure have been given. The linear motion stabilityof the particles has been proved. The new type of the compact superconductingcyclotron in the median energy is put forward as an instance for itsapplication to the EULIMA project.</TEXT></DOC>
