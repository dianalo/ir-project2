Amerada originally agreed to buy the properties, located in the Gulf of Mexico off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas, from the Houston-based affiliate of Transco Energy Co. for $911 million.    The acquisition includes interests in 41 natural gas fields and three oil fields, and could increase Amerada Hess's total natural gas reserves by 25% while doubling its domestic natural gas reserves.    The natural gas field currently produces about 150 million cubic feet a day and production is expected to rise in the near future. Crude oil production is averaging 7,800 barrels a day. </TEXT></DOC>
