 Tales would vary slightly with each retelling, but thestory-teller alone determined what listeners heard.andP;  Now, audiences of allkinds are beginning to have a say in the matter.andP;  The distinctions betweenplaywright and theatergoer, and more recently between producer and televisionaudience are blurring a little.andP;  At a Los Angeles improvisational comedyclub, performers in Funny You Should ask are asked to freeze so that thepatrons can shout out the actor's next emotion or action.andP;  In Tamara, a playperformed in mansions in both New York and Los Angeles, the audience chooseswhat character to follow from room to room, while concurrently other actorsperform elsewhere.andP;  But that is nonlinear interactivity without hightechnology.andM;This year, television viewers nationwide will join in the first interactivemystery movie, Can You Solve It?andP;  Based on a successful interactive videogame played at home, it was developed by Scott Jacobs, president of LaserArts Interactive, in Los Angeles.andP;  He is bringing it to television with theconviction that people no longer want to watch passively.andP;  Jacobs is devisinga method for viewers to create the story live, in real-time and compete tosolve the mystery and win prizes via a special 1-800 interactive telephonesystem.andP;  The program you will see feature the consequences of your directionand it is up to you to solve the crime and deliver your solution through thetelevision for scoring.andP;  Says Jacobs, &quot;We're creating a hybrid media that isessentially turning passive couch potatoes into active, motivated thinkers.&quot;andM;Interactive developers are as multifaceted as is multimedia, but they have incommon the desire to increase and enhance participation, to democratizeaccess to information in one way or another.andP;  Interactive multimedia is alsoseen as a way to broaden already saturated markets nd to recapture strayingones.andP;  NBC's Alan Gerson, VP of Program Marketing and Administration, hasasked interactive developers to come forward with their ideas because&quot;interactivity is a way to entice additional audiences.&quot;andP;  Leaders in the toy,video game, education, publishing, and computing worlds agree and thesedivisions are blurring; David Shefrin, Chairman of the Interactive VideoIndustry Association and an interactive videodisc pioneer formerly with IBM,says broadcasters are recognizing that they can be publishers, too.andP;  And theday when computer chips appear in TVs and TV tuner chips appear in personalcomputers is not far off.andP;  Some see IBM's announcement last spring that itwould support multimedia as an enhancement to its PS/2 personal computer lineas an indication that the computer giant is using interactive technology tofind new markets for personal computers.andM;Since multimedia merges so many kinds and quantities of data, optical storagemedia, the costs of players, and the need for authoring systems are becomingincreasingly important.andP;  According to Bob Moran of Business CommunicationsCompany, Inc., in Norwalk, CT, worldwide shipments of optical disks willreach $10 billion by 1993, up from $3.9 billion in 1988.andM;&quot;INTERTAINMENT&quot;andM;Nolan Bushnell, famous for his pioneering video games like Atari's Pong,wants to link storytelling and game playing by moving away from strictlinearity to the &quot;never-never land of branching, full bandwidth video.&quot;andP;  Hehopes to arrive there with an interactive game system, called ISIXs, that heis developing in conjunction with Hasbro, Inc., in Pawtucket, RI.andP;  Althoughloathe to give details, clues to ISIXs and his overall vision were to befound in his keynote address at Intertainment '88, a conference held byAlexander Associates, Inc., in New York.andP;  &quot;As surely as storytelling startedaround the campfire, so did game playing, because with prehistoric man, youfound knuckle bones of animals used for various games,&quot; he said.andP;  The twohave followed parallel tracks, he said, and many of us feel that the mediadistinctions are consistently merging and blurring.andP;  &quot;Our dream is: How canwe take some of the interactivity and fun of the game world and some of thefantasy in storytelling and merge them together so that we can have a littlebit of each?&quot;andM;Bushnell described two convergent paths that &quot;interactivists&quot; are taking toachieve the same goal of interactive multimedia.andP;  One group, the &quot;CD crowd,&quot;uses low bandwidth computers and very fast random access to information.andP;  Theother group, &quot;linear synthetic interactivists,&quot; with which he allies himself,has only linear access to their data.andP;  These two approaches differfundamentally in that the software for the linear method allows access to aframe only when needed.andP;  The software is harder to create, but the benefit isthat upon relinquishing random access in the hardware, you gain distributionflexibility.andP;  That is, such programs could reach viewers by cable TV, directsatellite television, or any other kind of mass environment, because theserequire linear formats, he said.andP;  No CD or videodisc laser player can dothose sorts of things, Bushnell said.andP;   Videodiscs pose limitations forbranching seamlessly, depending on whether they are adjacent or nonadjacenttrack, for example.andP;  On the other hand, even though these technologiesrequire expensive hardware, they do have a fixed frame in the encyclopediafunction, which Bushnell said is very important.andM;Ultimately, &quot;what we really want is to have a whole world linked by 400megahertz fiberoptic cable with about a trilobyte of memory in the basementof every home,&quot; he said.andP;  Looking at the cost of memory and the cost ofbandwidth over the last 20 years, he postulates that 80 to 90 percent ofAmerican homes can have not a trilobyte, but a couple of random accessgigabytes within the next 20 years.andP;  If that happens, software will providethe solutions, he said.andM;But now can true interactivity get into the marketplace now? &quot;Right now thebest interactive environment that we have is the personal computer,&quot; Bushnellsaid, &quot;It has the data that we want, and most floppy disks can hold enoughinformation on relatively low bandwidth computers, but you give up realisticimages.andP;  The level of graphics that we have is probably not acceptable fortrue realism,&quot; he said, &quot;We're still dealing with cartoons.andP;  You also give uphigh bandwidth speech.andP;  You can get some compression with the more expensivesystems, but the basic old PC, Apple II, or the Commodore environments allowvery limited speech.andM;&quot;the road is still difficult, and I think that the road is going to be long,but the discipline gained in the marketplace by understanding the difficultyof programming and creating branching for interactivity will be rewardedindependent of which systems prevail,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In order to tell a story,to create the interactivity, creating branches is key.andP;  And those who reallyhave that understanding will be able to dominate this marketplace.andP;  No matterwhat you say, it is clear to me, that the interactive entertainment marketwill swamp the movie nd TV businesses as we know them.&quot;andP;  Turning hisattention to video games, he noted that the size of that market exceeds $2billion annually.andP;  It is heavily skewed toward the male 8- to 8-year-oldmarketplace.andP;  But to bring the rest of the world in, &quot;all we have to do isshow interactivity using soft edge graphics, good audio, some adult type ofprogramming&quot; so that it is &quot;dressed down and non-techy,&quot; and the market couldreach $20 billion annually, he said.andM;Speaking with an eye more on education than on storytelling and video games,Ted Nelson has also expressed the desire to break out of a morass ofpassivity.andP;  He objects to bounderies imposed by failing to fully use thecapabilities of computers.andP;  Known for his book Literary Machines, and forcoining the word hypertext, Nelson told the press attending Microsoft'sFourth International CD-ROM Conference, &quot;We are used in the Western world tohierarchy and sequence.andP;  The educational system is based on hierarchy andsequence; there's a beginning, a middle, and an end to everything that'spublished.andP;  Why?andP;  In pedagogy we have hierarchy and sequence because it's aconvenient way to teach and it's a way to judge you.&quot;andP;  Objecting to formalcurricula, which in Latin means &quot;little race track,&quot; he added, &quot;What we needis a way that everybody can explore the subjects they want to learn, becauseit is those subjects you have chosen for yourself tht you learn best.&quot;andP;  Somepeople might enjoy compulsively following a sequence that someone elsecreated, he said, but others might want to explore material, creating theirown interconnections and perhaps publishing them.andM;ANALOG VIDEODISCSandM;Interactive laser videodiscs, which were first released in the lateseventies, are now used for educational and training applications in schoolsand industry, for cultural applications at museums and them parks, and formarketing and retailing.andP;  They offer varying degrees of interactivity andincorporate text, audio, video and graphics, depending on the application.andO;Some enable people to choose what to watch next by touching the relevantoutlined section of the monitor, just as some automatic bank tellers do.andO;Others are controlled by an external computer and allow users to access fullmotion video and even edit it into a documentary.andM;In Museums...andM;For the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, display via videodisc was the onlymedium by which the museum could bring its precious illuminated manuscriptsto the public, according to curator Thomas Kren.andP;  Ordinarily, only onetwo-page spread of these priceless medieval books of countless miniaturepaintings and accompanying text would sit in a glass case.andP;  That has limitedcurators and tantalized viewers.andP;  &quot;You could only get a taste of what it is,as work of art,&quot; says Kren.andP;  &quot;Manuscripts are particularly suited to the[videodisc] medium,&quot; he says, &quot;because it allows us to do something withtechnology for the public that we can't actually do in our galleries veryeffectively.andP;  Unlike most works of art, which can be seen entirely in agallery, an illumunated manuscript is a collection of decorated components.andO;Rarely is there one opening miniature; often there are 80 or 200 throughout avolume.andP;  We just bought a manuscript with 350 miniatures,&quot; Kren explains.andO;Since many manuscripts tell stories, seeing the sequence of miniatures all atonce is part of the &quot;aesthetic impact of that object as a work of art,&quot; Krenexplains.andP;  In addition, the videodisc enables people to appreciate howdramatically and even how cinematically a story is told.andP;  While it will neverreplace looking at the work of art itself, it is the only way for the publicto do the equivalent of paging through the books.andP;  To do so, museum goerswill touch the screen of Sony's View System computer, which controls aLasermax videodisc player.andM;Facsimile books of illuminated manuscripts are very expensive and not veryfaithful to the original, so getting the most colo-accurate andhigh-resolution results was a priority.andP;  The Getty hired InteractiveProduction Associates (IPA) in Los Angeles, to do the job.andP;  IPA's PeterBloch, David Schwartz, and Michael Yampolsky trailblazed image capturing andgraphic overlay techniques for the Sony View System.andP;  They decided to comparea film transfer method with Truvision, Inc.'s TARGA board.andP;  Film transferinvolved sending 4 x 5 transparencies supplied by the Getty to a cameratransfer service that put it on fine gain 35-mm motion picture stock, whichwas then transferred onto the videodisc.andP;  In the other method, they used aSony DXC3000H camera to send the image from the same transparencies onto aTARGA board.andP;  Those files were dumped off onto betacam and onto one-inchvideotape and finally onto the videodisc.andP;  &quot;Without a doubt, there arequalitative and quantitative differences.andP;  The highest resolution image comesdirectly off TARGA,&quot; says Bloch.andP;  Rather than use an off-the-shelf videodiscauthoring system, for extra flexibility, Yampolsky decided to have ithardcoded for the disk in C.andP;  Eventually the museum might sell such videodiscin its store.andM;From Broadcasting to Schools...andM;While Getty videodisc shows stills, many videodiscs show full motion video.andO;Last spring, ABC News Interactive, in New York, a new division of ABC/CapitalCities, and Optical Data Corporation, in Warren, NJ, released a videodisc,&quot;The '88 Vote: Campaign for the White House.&quot;andP;  One side contains announcementand withdrawal statements of all thirteen candidates, biographicalinformation, excerpts of key speeches at both conventions, and delegate andelectoral vote information.andP;  The other side contains Bush's and Dukakis'statements on issues, campaign commercials, election day coverage and votingresults.andP;  Transcripts of all the speeches are also available.andP;  The videodisccan be controlled with either a remote control or a Macintosh via a HyperCardstack, so you can navigate through the clips, information, and graphics.andM;According to David Bohrman, ABC News Interactive Executive producer, theinspiration for &quot;The '88 Vote&quot; came for the 10,000 electronic cueing cardsthat had been computerized for the first time using HyperCard for anchorPeter Jennings as he covered the election.andP;  Previously they used about 200 5x 7 paper index cards that were easy to lose and hard to read.andP;  The prototypevideodisc took two to three months to develop and is intended as aninteractive tool for teachers.andP;  &quot;The teacher is the glue that holds thistogether,&quot; he says, &quot;It's not something that the teacher can put on and goaway to smoke a cigarette for 20 minutes,&quot; says Bohrman.andP;  ABC NewsInteractive also created Documentary Maker, which lets the user become adirector; he or she can create a custom video on the spot.andP;  For example, theteacher can preselect a series of clips and show them to the class, and he orshe can also break the class into groups and tell them to come up with theirown documentary on the campaign.andM;From Analog to Digital...andM;Asked why he chose to go with analog videodisc instead of digital videostored on a hard disk or CD-ROM, Bohrman said that CD-ROM is still tooexpensive and digital video is not broadcast quality.andP;  &quot;It will be, and atthat point we'll move to that.&quot;andP;  In the meantime, since ABC News has amassive library of 350,000 videotapes and some film that can be transferredto tape, it plans to offer more videodiscs, such as &quot;In the Holy Land&quot; on thePLO and Israel, and one on the life of Martin Luther King.andM;But videodisc players are also expensive ($1000) and, according to TheVideodisc Monitor editor and publisher Rockly Miller, in 10 years about560,000 players have been installed nationwide.andP;  IBM has created MarketingAssistance Program (MAP) for its touchscreen Info-Windows PresentationSystem, which was initially developed in 1985 as an in-house educationalsystem.andP;  And now there are over 15 authoring systems and 60 MAP participants,according to Gary Barron, Senior Program Administrator, Advanced EducationSystems.andP;  But Barron sees videodiscs competing with digital video for thenext six years and then expects DVI on CD-ROM to supplant laser videodiscs.andO;And Miller says six years is quite a long time in the computer world.andO;Digital Video Interactive (DVI) will encroach upon videodiscs, but he says&quot;we will have a long way to go before digital formats are anywhere near ascost effective or data dense for full motion video and large databases.andP;  Inthe meantime, combinations of the technologies are evolving; an IBM/DukeUniversity project on teaching anatomy uses a PS/2 hooked up to a video-disc,which supplies the video, and a CD-ROM, which shows graphics.andP;  During thetransition from videodisc to digital video, Barron expects IBM to apply itsmarketing expertise and support in videodiscs to DVI.andM;DVI AND CD-IandM;At Microsoft's Fourth International CD-ROM conference, IBM and Intelannounced that they will further develop and market DVI for IBM's PS/2 lineof personal computers.andP;  The agreement not only enables the computer giant toenter the digital interactive multimedia market, it lends support to a newtechnology that has struggled to emerge.andP;  &quot;Where poised at the beginning ofan era that will reshape the way people use personal computers,&quot; said JamesCannavino, President of IBM's Entry System Division.andP;  &quot;With multimedia we'reon the verge of something almost magical,&quot; that enables people to watchvideos and hear sound and music instead of just reading text on a computerscreen, Cannavino claimed.andP;  &quot;It will appeal to a much broader audience,including those who are intimidated by interacting with computers.andP;  Withmultimedia we will win them over,&quot; he said.andM;The development agreement calls for an open system approach to integratinginteractive multimedia and will &quot;provide a stable common environment forapplications software vendors, computer manufacturers, and systemintegrators,&quot; said Intel's David House, Senior VP and General Manager of theMicrocomputer Components Group.andP;  Together IBM and Intel will define new DVItechnology products including boards, software, and integrated circuits.andO;They will also develop IBM PS/2 micro channel architecture (MCA) boardproducts.andP;  MCA supports the very high data rate DVI requires, according toCannavino.andP;  Intel will publish the specifications for DVI-based systems andexpects the agreement to expedite applications development through the early90s, when Intel's DVI chip sets and add-in boards will be readily availablefor end-users.andM;IBM and Intel will also establish a joint technology center to facilitate DVIacceptance, solicit customer requirements, disseminate technology informationand support application development.andP;  The center will open this year atIntel's facility in Princeton, NJ.andP;  Intel also introduced its Pro750application development platform for DVI, which both companies will market.andO;End-user delivery systems will be available later this year.andM;Many at the conference interpreted the partnership as a boon to digital videomultimedia, although some raised questions about DVI's transmissability.andO;Said Toshi Doi, Sony Corporation's Senior General Manager Super Micro SystemsStrategic Business Group, &quot;DVI involves asymmetrical coding and it takes sometime for preparation.andP;  Theoretically it could give better picture quality, onthe other hand, the chip from Intel could not be used for transmission or forstoring motion pictures on hard disk.andP;  Today, CCIT is defining transmissionstandards for motion pictures, and at least we should look very carefully atthat before defining the standard for the media.&quot;andP;  Since for computers, &quot;wecannot forget about transmission,&quot; he cautioned attendees to wait, think overasymmetrical coding and then carefully define the industry standard.andP;  ButMicrosoft's Rick Hargrove, Group Program Manager for Multimedia Systems,disagreed.andP;  He said DVI is media independent because you can play back off ahard disk and CD disk.andP;  &quot;I see technologies like DVI, that can compress andplay back information, as being very important in the future, regardless ofwhether we are at ISDN levels with optical fibers or multiple Gigabyte CDs.&quot;andM;As one of the major corporations that invented Compact Disk-interactive(CD-I) with Philips and Microware Corporations, it is not surprising thatSony might wish to cast doubt on DVI, which can be considered competingtechnology.andP;  (See Figure 1 for a comparison of these technologies.)andP;  DVI usesa general purpose signal processor for audio and custom processors fordecoding video and will run on top of personal computer computers' operatingsystems.andP;  CD-I is a packaged system, with its own player and a UNIX-likeoperating system called CD-RTOS (Compact Disk Real-Time Operating System),and the system will be hooked up to TV monitors and stereos.andP;  As such, CD-Iis aimed more for the consumer market than is the current delivery for ofDVI.andP;  To produce authoring tools for CD-I, five companies formed a newconsortium last spring, called OptImage, with operations based in Des Moinesand Chicago.andP;  The companies are N.V.andP;  Philips, the Netherlands; SunMicrosystems, Cupertino, CA; Microware Systems Corporation, Des Moines, IA;Datalink Corporation, Minneapolis, MN; and National Computer Systems, also inMinneapolis.andP;  Their charter is to consolidate available hardware and softwaredevelopment platforms using a set of new, high performance authoring toolsthat facilitate efficient creation of new titles.andP;  Philips and Sony haveissued three sets of specifications to developers: the Red Book for CD audio,the Yellow Book, for CD-ROM, and the Green Book, for CD-I.andP;  CD-IV, a Philipsformat to integrate CD-I and interactive video-disc, is expected soon.andM;One major difference between DVI and CD-I is that CD-I does not accomodatefull-screen full motion video for more than a few seconds.andP;  It can showpartial screen full-motion video, but is better suited for full-screenfull-motion animation, says former OptImage VP, Technical, Richard Bruno.andO;That is one reason why CD-I is said to be especially suited for children.andO;(See Tell Me Why on p. 878.)andM;Bruno has been heading the development of an authoring system, TheInformation Factory, which will enable audio/video designers, script writers,producers, and directors to design on a computer and automate such processesas digitizing that information, manipulating and interleaving it, and soforth.andP;  The Information Factory is modeled on the methods used to make amotion picture.andP;  &quot;The information factory concept first starts withspecifying,&quot; says Bruno, &quot;You can't make a film unless you have aspecification--a screenplay.andP;  Next, you add details like individual camerashots and settings.andP;  After these have been shot, they must be edited.andP;  Andonce you've done all the editing, then you have to splice it together and addaudio and then see what it plays like in its final cut.andP;  You may have toreedit again and there are iterative steps until you've satisfied with thetotal work,&quot; Bruno explains.andM;&quot;In the ideal Information Factory you also start with a screenplay, butinstead of pencils and paper, you use a computer to design the logicalstructure of the screenplay and then from that you then go deeper and deeperin the details of the application until you reach the level where you haveactual pictures and actual sounds and actual application software that runsit.andP;  And you specify that.andP;  You have cameras that can automatically grabslides and pictures from videotape and digitize them.andP;  It has audio grabbersthat grab audio that you've put on normal tape facilities, and it can editit.andP;  It can do all the things that you have to do in order to make a fulltitle.&quot;andM;Parts of the fully automated Information Factory, are now being beta tested,says OptImage VP Sal Locascio.andP;  OptDesigner helps specify and produce theequivalent of a screenplay.andP;  It then delivers its data to OptImager, whichdigitizes, cuts and pastes, and manipulates images resulting in a compressedimage, that could be put on a disk.andP;  OptTuner collects, digitizes, and editssound and then puts it in a compressed form that then can be put on the disk.andO;Two other tools are yet to come: OptOrganizer, which is a database that willtrack all the data that goes through the system and will provide statusindicators, and OptAssembler, which will assist the developer in producingthe application program and will assemble and test it.andM;HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MICROSOFT CD-ROMandM;CONFERENCEandM;While researchers wrestle with the technical issues of interactivemultimedia, developers are grappling with creating applications for manyformats without complete, usable development tools and authoring systems.andO;What would be an optimal tool for the myriad of individuals involved increating a multimedia production?andP;  Product will be built not solely byengineers, but by graphic artists, erstwhile movie and documentary makers,former sound studio technicians, or combinations of all of these, along withsoftware engineers.andP;  Their areas of expertise therefore range from writingand linking subroutines and thinking about compiling code, to creatinggraphic overlays, to film and video post production to sound editing.andP;  Eachis accustomed to his or her own technical aids.andP;  And since CD-ROM is a mediumfor storing and retrieving the textual, graphical, video, and audio datacomprising multimedia, much rests on the direction of that infant industry.andO;But figures vary due to methodologies and the many different kinds of opticaldisks.andP;  According to the Business Communications Company study, the averageannual growth rate between 1988 and 1993 for analog and digital videodiscplayers (which had a worldwide commulative total, or installed base, of3,726,500 in 1988) will be 17.1 percent.andP;  CD-ROM (1988 installed base, 69,700plus or minus 10,000) will grow 40.1 percent for the same period, andDC-video, which includes DVI and CD-I, will grow 33.5 percent.andP;  Looking justat the CD-ROM installed base, there were 171,000 drives worldwide in 1988,according to Julie B. Schwerin, President of Infotech, who conducted a studyfor the Optical Publishing Association.andP;  She reports total revenues for 1986,1987, and 1988, of $31 million, $81 million and $406 million, respectively,and expects revenues to quadruple in '89.andP;  Looking at CD-ROM sales, LindaHelgerson, Editor and Publisher of CD-ROM End-User, reports that in 1987, 30to 35,000 drives were sold worldwide, 70 to 100,000 were sold in 1988, andthis year sales could reach 150,000.andP;  Drives cost from $500 to $1,0000,depending on features and interfaces.andP;  Some call CD-ROM drives &quot;professional&quot;to distnguish them from home CD-DA (Digital Audio) players for stereos.andM;Whether multimedia industry participants think of CD-ROM as a storage ordistribution medium, they face the now classic problem that plagues the restof the computer industry; how to decide what to develop and for whatplatform.andP;  A clear, lucrative opportunity exists when building a businessapplication for a targeted market and a motivated buyer, but developing for ahorizontal community, that uses an entire spectrum of personal computers andvideo equipment presents difficult choices.andM;Nowhere was this high-tech version of the chicken-before-the-egg problem moreevident than at Microsoft's Fourt' Annual CD-ROM Conference last spring.andP;  Inthe final general session, Stewart Alsop, editor and Publisher of P.C.andO;Letter, probed CD-ROM publishers, micro computer marketers and VARs, andvideo game and business software developers for their thoughts on theindustry agenda.andP;  They discussed the implications of Microsoft's commitmentto multimedia and the growth path envisioned by Microsoft Chairman, BillGates, as outlined the day before.andM;CD-ROM Extended ArchitectureandM;Announced in August 1988 by Microsoft, Philips, and Sony, the CD-ROM XA (forExtended Architecture) format incorporates audio from the CD-I format.andP;  It isconsistent with ISO 9660, (the volume and the structure of CD-ROM), is anapplication extension of the Yellow Book, and draws on the Green Book.andP;  Twothousand copies of specifications were distributed at this year's conference.andO;Using products available today for Level 1, the first phase of Gates' growthpath, developers can begin working on multimedia applications withinterleaved audio and data.andP;  Level 1 includes DOS or Windows, 640K, VGAgraphics board (640 X 480 X 4), and CD-ROM XA.andP;  Level 2, which should beavailable in 1990 or 1991, with be based on Windows, a megabyte of memory,CD-ROM XA, advanced audio with a digital signal processor, and enhanced VGA(640 X 480 X 8).andP;  Level 3, with expected deliveries in 1991 or 1992, will runOS/2 Presentation Manager and will be able to play CD-ROM XA and DVIapplications.andM;Commenting on the primary issue confronting multimedia developers today,Microsoft's Hargrove distinguished between encoding data for CD-ROM,integrating it, and then presenting it as multimedia.andP;  &quot;Multimedia doesn'toccur until you present that data,&quot; he said, &quot;then you need a presentationplatform.&quot;andP;  Once all the different elements are integrated with thedistribution data, the most important and difficult task must still beperfected--integrating time.andP;  &quot;When you start dealing with time and the realnature of multimedia, something that comes close to what consumers expect,...andP;  you can't do it,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You run into bottlenecks veryquickly--synchronization problems [and] contention problems.andP;  You have to bea very good engineer [just] to do a demo.&quot; Synchronization of operations andparallel data transfers are a difficult problem given today's personalcomputers and operating systems, he said.andP;  Microsoft is addressing this withIBM by creating a natural user environment, Hargrove said.andP;  In addition,multimedia applications are not practical now because of the variations inthe installed base of video adapters, processors, RAM speeds, hard diskspeeds, whether there is a CD-ROM or not, Hargrove said.andM;Professional and Consumer DrivesandM;This complex picture makes Microsoft reluctant to rush to deliver a less thanfull integrated system.andP;  Further, it could not be offered at the right price,Hargrove said.andP;  At $2,500 to $4,000, such systems could fail to meetexpectations, but disappointment due to price is not the only fear;misunderstanding CD-ROM in the entertainment/electronic games industry couldthreaten the reputation of the CD-ROM industry as a whole.andP;  CD-ROM systemsfor consumers could prove disappointing if people expect professional CD-ROMcapabilities, according to Sony's Doi.andP;  &quot;I don't believe people understandthe difference between the consumer CD drive and the CD-ROM drive we are nowselling.andP;  The major difference is that the consumer drive's average seek timeis 3 seconds.andP;  On the other hand, the professional drive's seek time is 300milliseconds.andP;  Also, was is quite different.andP;  Therefore, if you use theconsumer drive for heavy professional use, you will be very disappointed,&quot; hesaid.andP;  The consumer CD-ROM might also affect the ability of personalcomputers to penetrate the consumer market, said Jim Mackonochie, chairmanand founder of the British company Pergamon Compact Solution, a division ofMexwell Communications Corporation.andP;  This suggested that attempte to find newmarkets for the IBM PC and PS/2, which many interpret to be the purpose ofthe IBM/Intel DVI alliance, could fall flat.andP;  Pointing to the 70,000 CD-ROMspackaged within NEC's new video game project PC Engine that were shipped inthe preceding four months, Mackonochie state that including the other 170,000professional drives, that meant a 70 percent increase in the installed baseat a mass market price point.andP;  &quot;The entertainment industry is going to bedriven by CD-ROM peripherals to video game machines,&quot; he said, &quot;and withinthe year we're going to have the second generation of Segas and Nintendosbased on the 16-bit architecture.andP;  The growth of this may have an effect onthe MS-DOS platform trying to move down into the mass market.&quot;andP;  Hargroveretorted, &quot;Potentially, [but] I don't know if the threat is any more realthan CD-I.&quot;andP;  Doi then invited manufacturers of all computer architectures tojoin in on CD-ROM XA to create a &quot;common space&quot; between IBM PCs, Macintoshesand CD-I systems.andP;  In response, Apple's Jim Davis, Director of SystemSoftware Product Marketing, stated that Apple sees CD-ROMs permeating itsproduct line, and that the CD-ROM XA levels schedule was not a threat to theMac.andP;  &quot;We want to get the ball rolling ...andP;  We're always glad to have IBM'sparticipation in the marketplace,&quot; he said wryly.andP;  But Apple had declined toquote its CD-ROM, at a press conference the day before.andM;Alsop picked up on CD-I, asking Doi how Sony regards CD-I's future.andP;  Sony'senthusiasm for and commitment to CD-I had been doubted earlier, since Sonywas conspicuously absent from an OptImage press conference, but Doi statedthat Sony has not made any decision about CD-I.andP;  &quot;There might seem to be acontradiction between CD-I and CD-ROM XA, but its not a contradiction,&quot; Doiinsisted, &quot;XA makes it easier to then go to CD-I.andP;  CD-I could be a consumerimplementation of CD-ROM XA.&quot;andM;CD-ROM XA and Authoring ToolsandM;What might be the end product if a publication or production evolves throughthe three XA growth paths outlined by Gates? Pergamon's Boeing 757Maintenance Manual serves as an example in the computer industry.andP;  At XALevel 1, Pergamon envisions spoken instructions when an engineer calls uptext, for example.andP;  The audio could say, &quot;Don't put more than 24 ft/lbs oftorque on this nut.&quot; At Level 2, the screen could show a color picture of acomponent, and at Level 3, a digital video of a mkaintenance man could showhow he installs that component.andP;  While this might be good for verticalmarkets where revenue per product shipped is high, Alsop commented that it ishard ot imagine revising a product every nine months for markets in whichproducts command lower prices.andP;  But Doi observed that although prepared on aPC, Sony found that the Boeing manual could be played back on a UNIXworkstation using the KRS retrieval system.andP;  That means greater possibilitieswithin vertical markets, Doi said, and the same strategy can be used forhorizontal markets--another reason why he would like Apple to support XA.andM;Experimenting with the value added by audio at Level 1 in theentertainment/mass market real, Pergamon recently incorporated full stereoaudio into the game Defender of the Crown.andP;  &quot;We'll have to see how consumerspay with their dollars and pounds for this added dimension,&quot; Mackonochiesaid.andM;Audio help files mentioned by Mackonochie are widely foreseen.andP;  He said, &quot;Every publisher in this room has this vision.andP;  We will be able to publishmultimedia products in ten years' time.&quot;andP;  And David Roux, VP of InformationServices Group at Lotus Corp. said, &quot;If we're honest with ourselves, we [willadmit that we] haven't come anywhere near scratching the surface of thecapabilities at Level 1.andP;  There are years of work to be done.&quot;andP;  He also addedthat the expectations for &quot;quality of production values are an order ofmagnitude greater than anything available today.&quot;andP;  Roux expressed thesentiment that the industry should not preoccupy itself with Level 2 and 3time frames.andP;  He urged serious developers to find a business application,start building a product, and figure out what price they can sell it forgiven the amount of time it takes to build.andP;  New capabilities could be addedlater.andP;  At a later point in the panel he went so far as to say that lack oftools does not stand in the way.andP;  &quot;If you have a great idea, you can do it,&quot;he said, &quot;It costs a little more money, takes longer, but that's no reasonnot to do it.andP;  What stands in the way is lack of will.&quot;andP;  The audienceapplauded.andM;But John Scull, President of Macromind, Inc., reiterated the need for toolsand urgent need for developers to choose platforms.andP;  His company makes adesktop video editor and storyboarding tool for the Macintosh.andP;  &quot;Many of usare in a position where we have to sell products today and must look atplatforms that have consistency, [on which] people can actually do thingstoday.andP;  That's why our hopes are on the Mac.&quot;andM;But Hypercard, which requires no programming, is already widely used eventhough it isn't professional authoring tool, Alsop commented.andP;  WhenMackonochie indicated that better development tools were needed, Apple'sDavis countered that creating the right tools is an &quot;issue of iteration.&quot;andO;Hypercard &quot;might not be the right end tool, but it is an end tool,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;We have to produce tools so people can iterate toward the mass market.andP;  Inthis business it is rare that you start with a blockbuster product.andP;  Peoplehave to be willing to try and willing to iterate.andP;  We're trying to providefundamentals....andP;   We don't quite know what the blockbuster product is, butwe do want to make sure that it's possible to do it on the Mac,&quot; Davis added.andM;Although he believes that choosing a platform is a key issue, Scull said themain objective should be to get tools to people so that they can use theirimaginations and get direct feedback.andP;  That will lead to better content.andO;Macromind is focusing on all dimensions--time, sound, motion,synchronization, and high quality graphics, he said.andP;  &quot;Otherwise all we'redoing is taking a book and throwing it on a screen,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's likewhen the movie business started.andP;  All they did was shoot a play untilGriffith came along and said 'Let's use our technology, let's use ourimaginations.'andP;  And the industry took off.andP;  That's what needs to happenhere.&quot;andM;Some complain that CD-ROM is progressing too slowly.andP;  Others point out thatafter three years the business, at $300 or $400 million in sales, is largerthan the PC business was after the same number of years and is thereforemoving very rapidly.andP;  And CD-ROM has its detractors.andP;  Guy Nouri, President ofInteractive Picture Systems, Inc. in New York, has been producing interactivevideodiscs for almost ten years and now advocates interactive programs storedon hard disks.andP;  He emphasizes the effectiveness of video stills, Says Nouri,&quot;I'm not embarrassed.andP;  i think 90 percent of the content of the message canbe conveyed with intelligently presented and produces stills, with sound.andO;It's a hell of a lot cheaper to maintain.&quot;andP;  Content with compressing videostills and storing them on hard disks, which are mainstream, he notes thatinformation can be updated more easily.andP;  &quot;Interactive technology is valuablefor getting people to react with the information.andP;  But if that information isold, that experience is old,&quot; he says.andP;  He has invented a video fax systemthat transmits stills and updates interactive installations over telephonelines.andP;  &quot;There still no real reason to get into CDV (Compact Digital Video)right now,&quot; Nouri says, &quot;That technology really hasn't settled out yet, andaround the bend, from Radio Shack, we're going to have a read-write disk(Thor), which will blow CDV out of the water--and be a hell of a lotcheaper.&quot;andM;Speaking at Microsoft's CD-ROM Conference about &quot;the crime of WYSIWYG [WhatYou See Is What You Get],&quot; which is to use the computer as a paper simulator,Ted Nelson was also not enthusiastic about the opportunities presented byCD-ROM.andP;  It could perpetuate the tendency to simulate paper, he said, anddefeat the possibilities of multimedia.andP;  &quot;Here we have this extraordinaryinstrument and yet we use it to imitate a piece of paper and the waysomething is going to look when it's put on a paper.&quot;andP;  WYSIWYG means thatwhat you get out on paper is all you can have, he said.andP;  &quot;In other words,we're limiting output to this picture of something that's going on paper.andO;It's like driving a 747 on the highway.andP;  Similarly with CD-ROM ...andP;  I thinkCD-ROM is a shuck 'n' jive.andP;  It's just another system of disks.andP;  The wholepoint is to make these nonsensical boundaries of storage media go away, notto erect walls of the boundary of the disk.&quot;andP;  Creating such closed packagesis &quot;no way to build a world,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I want to make the world a betterplace, not a re-Balkanized, hard-up system of little fiefdoms.&quot; Pointing tothe Oxford English Dictionary on a CD-ROM, he objected, &quot;You've got to usetheir interactive structure on the screen, use their key commands.andP;  The onlyway you can use it is their particular way, unless you write your own screendrivers and so on.&quot;andP;  Although not criticizing that work in particular, heexplained, he said there is something wrong with the whole idea of dividingthe world into independent, incompatible kingdoms.andM;Looking to the future, Bushnell says that as Americans have more leisuretime, they will tire &quot;of being passive to death.andP;  We want our active minds...andP;  The next industrial revolution isn't going to be, like many peoplethink, a change in man's mind.andP;  It's not going to be thought of on the levelof implementation.andP;  It's going to be thought of on the level of creation.&quot;andO;As products allow people to pursue creative solutions, he says, we will see&quot;an erosion of the barriers to creativity.&quot;andM;Tell Me WhyandM;Designed to answer questions children most often ask, the CD-I title, Tell MeWhy, encourages kids aged 7 to 13 to explore five broad topics: our world,how things began, the human body, how things work , and the zoo.andP;  Based on anewspaper series from the 1960s with the same title, the CD-I version wasdeveloped by Interactive Production Associates for American InteractiveMedia.andP;  Both a Macintosh II and an IBM PC were used during developmemt.andM;The image on the top is the menu for the exhibit called &quot;First Pictures,&quot;which poses the questions, Who made the first photograph?andP;  How did moviesstart? and Who made the first paintings?andP;  The image on the bottom shows partof the answer to the last question, while the audio expains cave art inLascaux, France.andM;Created with Pixel Paint, a CLUT-based (Color Look Up Table) paint programthat runs on the Mac II, the graphics contain up to 128 colors.andP;  These werechosen from the 256 colors.andP;  These were chosen from the 256 colors availableon the Mac, but the CD-I environment actually has a palette of 16.8 millioncolors.andP;  With CD-I these colors can be changed automatically, so in oneexhibit about the difference between how light mixes and how colored paintsmix, children watch red, green, and blue combine to form white, and then red,yellow, and blue combine to make black.andP;  &quot;It's not like video, where we wouldhave to have a different frame for every different thing you saw,&quot; saysDirector Michael Yampolsky, &quot;CD-I can actually change the colors.&quot;andP;  inaddition, CD-I dissolves between two planes, so some animatics that normallyrequire editing can be done in run time.andP;  For example, in one exhibit notshown here, a heart appears to be beating as the animations alternate betweentwo frames on different planes.andM;IPA/AIM often had to create production methodologies from scratch.andP;  The CLUTanimations on the MAC had to be adjusted for differences in the pixel aspectratio from the Mac to the CD-I environmental, for example.andP;  When images werecreated with TARGA and Vista boards, IPA/AIM wrote routines in C to takefiles from the Mac to the CD-I system.andM;Some of the history of authoring tools for videodiscs seems to be repeatingitself here.andP;  &quot;Just as we had to create methodologies, we had to participatein creating development tools.andP;  The development budget for Tell Me Why inincredible because we have had to invent everything,&quot; says Yampolsky, &quot;It'slike when we made videodiscs, seven or eight years ago.andP;  We would createmethodologies that would let us do things relatively expensively.andP;  The secondtime around we would do something in three days that took three weeks thefirst time.&quot;andP;  In addition, a final CD-I product can be very disk intensive,taking up as much as 650 megabytes.andM;Courtesy of Interactive Production Associates, Copyright American InteractiveMedia.andP;  Director, Michael Yampolsky;
