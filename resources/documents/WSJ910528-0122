Zant (McCleskey's secondhabeas case in that court), wrongly accuses the majority ofacting as legislators in that case. The radical expansion offederal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; jurisdiction to review judgments ofstate criminal courts was the product of a pair of casesdecided in 1963, by the revisionist Warren court: Fay v. Noiaand Townsend v. Sain. Subsequent legislation on the subjectmerely codified what Congress apparently perceived as minimumconstitutional standards imposed by the Supreme Court.   The McCleskey case does no more than address thepersistent abuse of the writ in intervening years byactivists seeking to overturn death sentences by any means.Restoration of the tradition of respect for state courtjudgments that was reflected in the Judiciary Act of 1789 canhardly be considered judicial legislation. Contrary to yourill-considered statements, federal habeas corpus jurisdictionis not and never has been &quot;virtually the only way a convictedprisoner has to protect against law-enforcement abuses.&quot;State courts can and do protect the rights of the partiesbefore them, and did so largely without federal oversightuntil 1963.</LP><TEXT>   Robert H.
