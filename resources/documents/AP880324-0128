Jesse Helms to require new intelligencestudies of what Helms says are Soviet missiles unaccounted for bythe U.S.-Soviet treaty on medium-range atomic weapons.   The committee voted 15-2 against Helms' amendment to the treatywhich would have required President Reagan to certify the accuracyof the Soviet claims that there are 650 SS-20 missiles. Thedeclared weapons will have to be destroyed after the treaty takeseffect.   Helms, R-N.C., argued that up to 300 more SS-20s are ``hidden,''and he cited Defense Intelligence Agency reports which he saidsupport his claim.   But Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., said, ``I don't believePresident Reagan would have signed this treaty'' if he believed theSoviets had successfully hidden a large force of SS-20 missiles.   The vote was the latest decision in which the panel decided bylarge bipartisan majorities to reject attempts by Helms and Sen.Larry Pressler, R-S.D., another conservative critic, to change thetreaty.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the committee, said thepanel was headed toward overwhelming approval of the pact.   ``I would hope _ and I think _ that we will continue to showstrong bipartisan support,'' said Pell after the panel voted bylopsided margins Wednesday to reject amendments by Helms andPressler.   Helms had originally proposed 36 amendments and Pressler offeredthree more, despite appeals from the Reagan administration for theSenate to approve the treaty without changes.   After it became apparent he had few votes on his side, Helmssaid he planned to drop most of his amendments.   Pell announced that the committee will finish voting on allamendments by Tuesday afternoon next week and will then decide onthe treaty itself.   When the measure finally reaches the floor, overwhelmingapproval is expected with no more than 10 to 12 of the 100 senatorsexpected to vote against it. Ratification requires a two-thirdsvote.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed Dec. 8 byPresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, requiresthe elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of300 to 3,400 miles. It includes on-site inspection among its strictverification provisions.   Helms dropped many of his amendments after he came under firefrom fellow Republicans, some of whom claimed he was trying todelay a final Senate vote until after the next summit meetingbetween Reagan and Gorbachev.   That meeting has now been set for May 29-June 2 in Moscow, theWhite House announced Wednesday.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said: ``We're just in a delay, stallsituation which I find disagreeable. ... If you don't have thevotes and just try to overload it with amendments, that isn'tfair.''   Meantime, Pell and other Democrats tried to work out some typeof compromise between Congress and the White House over the chiefremaining hurdle, a dispute about the legal power to interprettreaties.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said in a floorspeech that it will be necessary to add a reservation or anunderstanding which spells out the Senate position.   ``This matter is not going to be resolved, in my judgment, byany exchange of letters, because a future administration can say,`we don't agree with that interpretation at all,''' Byrd said.   Reagan asserts that the executive branch can unilaterally changethe U.S. intepretation of a treaty, a view disputed by the Senate.The fight arises from a difference in how to interpret the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   As it worked through the treaty, the panel:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Voted down, 12-3, a Helms proposal to change the treaty andallow the United States to deploy non-nuclear cruise missiles. Thetreaty bans all cruise missiles, whether equipped with nuclear orconventional warheads, because there is no effective way to verifywhich warheads are on the missile.   _Voted down, 12-2, a Helms amendment which would include theSoviets' Scud B missile as one of the banned weapons. The missileis not now banned because it has a shorter range than 300 miles,but Helms claimed Scud B missiles sold by the Soviets to Iraq havebeen fired at ranges which would fall within the INF ranges.   _Rejected, 13-2, a Helms plan that would prohibit either sidefrom testing missiles in the INF range.   _Defeated, 15-2, a Pressler amendment which would block thetreaty from taking effect until Reagan certifies that there isparity in Europe between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces. The Sovietshave a large advantage in some categories of non-nuclear weaponsand Pressler and other treaty critics say the elimination ofmedium-range atomic missiles will take away a major NATO deterrentto a Soviet attack.</TEXT></DOC>
