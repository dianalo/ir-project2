We realized that tragic situations like thiscan occur,'' said John Zienter, agent-in-charge of the DEA's officehere.   It has been an especially rough year for the Los Angeles DEA. InFebruary, agents Paul Seema, 52, and George Montoya, 34, were shotto death and agent Jose Martinez, 25, was wounded during anundercover drug operation in Pasadena. Two of the drug dealers werekilled and a third was wounded.   On Tuesday, three former Los Angeles DEA agents were charged withlaundering more than $608,000 _ apparently accumulated while dealingin the narcotics trade, authorities said.   By Wednesday, Zienter and agents tried to overcome the bad newsof the previous day by focusing attention on their latest weapon inthe drug war, a Colt 9mm submachine gun to help combat drug runners'automatic weapons.   Zienter said the new weapons are necessary because of ``thetremendous danger involved in the narcotics business and enforcingnarcotics laws.''   Reporters wanted to know what made three law enforcement officerssworn to fight crime allegedly decide to join forces with thecriminals instead.   ``It certainly makes good police officers sick,'' Zienter said.   Former DEA agents John Jackson, 39, of Claremont and WayneCountryman, 45, of Walnut were arrested Tuesday and arraigned on acharge of conspiring to defraud the United States by obstructing theduties of the Internal Revenue Service.   The third ex-agent, Darnell Garcia, 41, of Rancho Palos Verdes,remained at large. Authorities believe he may have fled to Madrid.   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner said the three are charged withconspiracy to launder the cash and transferring the funds toSwitzerland. They are accused of allegedly hiding unreported incomeby transferring U.S. currency to Switzerland between 1984 and 1987.   Internal Revenue Service agent John Anderson said theinvestigation ``uncovered evidence that supported the allegationthat the three former DEA agents were involved in money launderingand narcotics trafficking during and following their employment asspecial agents.''   The affidavit was filed in support of a search of Garcia's RanchoPalos Verdes home. The affidavit stated Garcia bought a home in 1987for $580,000, paid for in full. Jackson bought one in 1988 for$750,000, the affidavit stated.   The 22-page affidavit unsealed Wednesday included witnessstatements saying that two narcotics traffickers who are fugitivesfrom Detroit frequented an apartment that Garcia rented in LosAngeles. The affidavit also detailed numerous trips to Europe inwhich the former agents allegedly bought cashier's checks madepayable to Swiss banks.   Bonner and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joyce A. Karlin refused todisclose any details about the source of the money, but Bonner said``the corrupting effects of drug trafficking'' was to blame. Zienterrefused to discuss the case.   Mary McMenimen, spokeswoman for Bonner's office, said theinvestigation is continuing to determine if others were involved inthe corruption.   DEA chief John Lawn in Washington issued a statement saying thecharges ``reveals the integrity'' of the agency's internal policingmechanisms.   ``While three former employees have been charged, the focusshould remain on those DEA men and women who risk their lives dailyto enforce the law against anyone who violates the law,'' Lawn said.   Jackson, who prosecutor Karlin claims has associated with drugkingpins, was ordered held without bail and Countryman was releasedon $120,000 bail late Tuesday.   If convicted of the conspiracy charge, each defendant would facea maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</TEXT></DOC>
