When a customer wants to buy auto insurance, Mr. Frye offers a clipboard and a sheet of paper to write on. He then carefully copies the information onto a three-part paper form and gives it to his secretary. She mails it to an office in Virginia, where a clerk types the information into a computer. That computer updates the computer on Mr. Frye's desk once a week.    This convoluted process illustrates why some white-collar industries aren't showing the significant productivity gains they expected would follow heavy investment in computers. Indeed, productivity -- as measured in output per hour worked -- actually fell in the finance, real-estate and insurance industries between 1973 and 1986, according to the President's Council of Economic Advisers. (Factory productivity rose overall during the same period.)    While some individual banks, brokers and mutual funds have made gains with computers, such exceptions are largely absent among insurers. A closer look at that industry sheds light on some of the common sources of computer trouble throughout the service sector: clinging to old habits, insufficient planning before deploying computers, settling for minor gains where major ones are possible and getting bogged down in extraneous information or in expensive projects that don't pay off.    &quot;Fifteen years into the 'high-teching' of America, the U.S. is still trapped in a quagmire of low-productivity growth,&quot; says Stephen Roach, a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. economist. &quot;The biggest disappointments show up loud and clear in the financial-services industry.&quot;    Because measuring service output is so much more complex than counting goods coming off an assembly line, measures of service productivity are generally questionable. But in this case the numbers do describe the trend accurately, experts say. &quot;If you take a look at the insurance industry broadly, you'd conclude that as a business it hasn't gotten more productive over the years,&quot; says Frank Orzell, an insurance specialist at Index Group, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm.    The poor productivity of white-collar workers is especially troubling because services now account for about half of the nation's economic output. Moreover, some services, particularly in the financial area, are beginning to face the kind of competition from the Japanese that has proved so tough for American manufacturers.    Of course, some U.S. insurance-industry executives are confident that computers have had a positive effect, even though the gains may not be apparent. For example, a recent survey conducted by United Research Co., a Morristown, N.J., consulting firm, found that 53% of insurance-company chief executives said computers significantly reduced overhead costs.    &quot;Very often, an estimate (to justify a project) will say, 'We're going to save a sixth of a person here and a third of a person there,'&quot; notes Michael J. McLaughlin, senior vice president for computers at New York Life Insurance Co. &quot;I am absolutely convinced that the savings are there. Proving them is something else.&quot;    However, the same United Research survey found that a sizable 37% of the executives believed computers hadn't lowered overhead, and that the remaining 10% weren't sure. This is especially telling in an industry where companies devote as much as 20% of their budgets to computers and the people who run them. Together, U.S. insurance companies spend around $7 billion a year just on hardware.    So why aren't they getting a bigger bang for their technology bucks?    Some err by automating existing practices instead of changing them to exploit technology. &quot;In our experience, when information systems don't live up to expectations, the problem turns out to be that the systems . . . were created to pave the cow path rather than straighten it,&quot; says William J. Jeffery, vice president of United Research.    A few years back, Shenandoah Life Insurance Co. discovered that, even though it had a modern computer system, 27 working days and action by 32 employees were needed to issue a new life-insurance policy to a customer who was replacing an old one. The problem, Shenandoah realized, was that clerks still worked, as they had before computers, in assembly-line fashion: One specialized in processing surrenders of old policies, another in issuing new policies, a third in transferring cash values from old to new and so on.    The Roanoke, Va., company has since revamped its procedures. With clerks less specialized and working in teams, processing time has been reduced to as little as two days. Over the past three years, the number of such transactions processed has risen 28%, while the numbers of workers handling them has fallen 15%.    Another reason big computer investments haven't paid off in increased productivity is that companies sometimes are preoccupied with marketing maneuvers. New York Life, for instance, is in the midst of a $150 million project that involves 40% of its 650 computer programmers and will take more than five years. The goal is to consolidate files so that a single statement would contain information about all of a customer's policies. The project, Mr. McLaughlin points out, was sold to top management not as a way to cut costs but as a way to compete with such financial giants as American Express Co.    &quot;Much of information processing is used as a tool in the effort to move customers from one company to another,&quot; contends Martin Neil Baily, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. Individual companies may benefit, he reasons, but the industry and the economy as a whole don't.    Data overload can also be a problem. Robert Carlson, executive vice president of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Milwaukee, insists that computers allow Northwestern agents to do more business with less human help. But even he recognizes the possibility of being overwhelmed by the reams of information that computers provide. &quot;There is more information available than the human mind can digest,&quot; he says. &quot;We've gained a lot more nice-to-know information.&quot;    Elsewhere, precedence isn't necessarily given to computer projects that would be of greatest benefit to the entire company. Martin Huysman, vice president for information systems at Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Connecticut Inc., says that such was the problem at his company for the past several years. His staff would get a steady stream of requests for new reports and different policy configurations. Programmers were swamped, and priorities confused.    &quot;The squeaky wheel got what he wanted,&quot; Mr. Huysman says. &quot;We were traditionally late, over budget and prone to failure.&quot;    Only this year did Connecticut Blue Cross -- which spends about 13% of its total annual budget, or more than $16 million, on computers and related personnel -- begin asking senior executives to rank requests by importance to overall corporate goals. &quot;It's kind of refreshing,&quot; says Mr. Huysman. But he adds that the company still isn't comparing the cost of computer projects with expected benefits.    Consultants say that Blue Cross is typical in that respect. In addition, the United Research survey found that, while 57% of insurance chief executives said it was standard practice to review computer projects to see if the benefits were as great as promised, only 38% of the industry's top computer executives said such reviews actually occurred.    &quot;There are no computer problems,&quot; asserts Paul Strassman, a retired Xerox Corp. computer executive who has written about corporate computer misuse. &quot;There are only management problems.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
