Like many U.S. growers,he had found that Benlate, a fungicide from Du Pont Co. forfruits, vegetables and ornamental plants, always got the jobdone.   Not this time. All the seedlings in the sprayed area beganslowly dying. &quot;We were going nuts,&quot; says the Litchfield,Mich., nurseryman. After first blaming his workers, thensuspecting sabotage by a disgruntled ex-employee, he finallyzeroed in on what he believes is the real culprit: thepesticide itself.</LP><TEXT>   His blight was among the first signs of what has becomeone of the most mysterious, and potentially most costly,pesticide debacles the U.S. has seen. Soon after Mr. Raker'sproblems surfaced, Du Pont pulled the most widely sold formof Benlate off the market, suspecting contamination.   It was already too late for hundreds of growers. Benlatewas one of the biggest-selling commercial pesticides in theU.S., and it now is alleged to have caused plant damage in 40states. In Florida, the worst-hit state, many greenhousegrowers say they're nearing bankruptcy, and more than 1,000have filed claims against Du Pont. &quot;It's wiped out eightyears of retained earnings,&quot; says Paul Remelius, a nurseryowner in Stuart, Fla.   Du Pont doesn't deny that there's a problem with Benlate.But despite putting a small army of scientists to work on it,the company is baffled. Meanwhile, costs are rising. Thecompany, based in Wilmington, Del., has paid out $120 millionin settlements so far, mostly in Florida. It has alreadytaken after-tax charges of $41 million from the recall, andsaid Friday it will take an added $175 million after-taxcharge this quarter. Growers and university researchersestimate Du Pont's ultimate liability higher.   Except in Florida, the problem hasn't received widespreadnotice. Recent Wall Street analysts' reports on Du Pont don'tmention it, and the recall of most Benlate in March didn'taffect the stock of the giant chemicals concern, which had1990 revenue of about $40 billion. Du Pont mentioned Benlatein its second- and third-quarter reports, but in one-linereferences, mostly deep in lists of footnotes.   A lawyer for several Florida nurseries, Sidney Crawford,contends that Du Pont &quot;has done a tremendous job of keepingthe wraps on&quot; the Benlate story. The company denies that.Settlements have required growers to keep quiet about theirdamages, but Du Pont officials note that this is standard inlegal settlements, and that they have disclosed news aboutthe Benlate recall on several occasions.   But how could a pesticide that has been used for 20 years,apparently safely, go so badly awry?   Benlate-affected plants behave mysteriously indeed. Theyseem to play Peter Pan, refusing to grow up. The damagingchemical from Benlate &quot;appears to be a plant growthregulator&quot; that stunts growth, says Jim Davidson, aUniversity of Florida research dean whose school is trying tocrack the case. A plant may look fine, but &quot;it doesn't growto full maturity. A gardenia plant that should be two feethigh and have buds may be only one foot high.&quot;   This has posed a business-ethics issue for some growers:whether to sell plants sprayed with Benlate that may keelover once removed from their greenhouse life-support systemand tender loving care. The dilemma has been especially acutefor severely hurt growers who've suspected competitors ofcutting their losses by quietly selling sick plants.   &quot;It was very tough to work four or five years on somethingand have to put a chainsaw to it just when it was just aboutmature,&quot; says Mr. Remelius, the Florida ornamental-plantgrower. &quot;We took the high moral ground&quot; and paid the pricefinancially, he says.   Many growers are reluctant to talk about the Benlateproblem, fearing they could lose business or face claims fromcustomers whose plants later die. &quot;I don't think it's aproblem the public needs to know about,&quot; snaps one nurserymanin Boston.   Many growers and some scientists outside Du Pont suspectthat this is a case of unknown interreactions amongchemicals. Under certain conditions, compounds in Benlatemight break down or react with substances in the environmentto form chemicals toxic to plants. If so, crop damage fromtraces of the stuff could continue after usage had stopped.Such rogue reactions, if confirmed, would raise basicquestions about how much pesticide makers really know aboutthe long-term effects of some of their products.   There's no evidence Benlate has hurt animals or people.But the possibility that it is fostering unknown chemicalreactions toxic to plants has raised concerns. &quot;I believethere is something going on that could possibly get into thefood chain,&quot; says Robert Haines, a former chemical-companyresearch manager and now a columnist for Florida Environmentsmagazine.   Growers say Du Pont acted quickly when the problem firstsurfaced and has made interim payments in some cases whiledamages were negotiated. However, some growers now chargethat the company is dragging its feet in negotiations.   Du Pont says that 58% of the Benlate claims in Floridahave been settled, denied or withdrawn, and that the numberof new claims has slowed markedly. Growers and their lawyerssay claims settled so far tend to be the smaller ones. The500 or so Florida claims remaining include a good many forover $1 million, they say, adding that Du Pont typically ispaying about half of claimed damages. (The company won'tcomment on that.)   Morris Bailey, Du Pont's manager of Benlate products, saysthe company and its outside adjuster, Crawford andamp; Co. ofAtlanta, are handling claims as fast as they can. Evaluatingthem is complicated; Benlate damage such as yellowing leavesin young plants or stunted roots can be caused by many otherthings. The limited understanding of how Benlate harmsfurther complicates damage assessment.   &quot;We're as frustrated as the claimants,&quot; says Mr. Bailey.&quot;We've had dozens of scientists working on this day and nightfor months and still haven't come up with a general cause forthe alleged damage.&quot;   But Du Pont says its scientists have ruled out somethings, including contamination by a widely used weed-killercalled atrazine. Atrazine contamination of Benlate batcheshas occurred at least twice in the past, because the samecontractors that made Benlate for Du Pont also made atrazinefor others. In 1989, contamination was blamed for tens ofmillions of dollars of damage and raised questions aboutquality control at Du Pont and its outside contractors. ButDu Pont says the small amount of atrazine contaminationdiscovered can't explain the widespread syndrome nowassociated with Benlate.   The second case of atrazine contamination, last March, mayhave been a stroke of luck. Until then, the often-subtlefirst symptoms of Benlate poisoning hadn't been associatedwith the fungicide. But Du Pont's contamination warning andrecallbesides preventing even more damageled to record checksand helped growers to make the link. &quot;Suddenly, everythingfell into place,&quot; says Mr. Raker of Michigan.   The problem seemed to go away after Mr. Raker'sBenlate-sprayed areas were scrubbed and treated withactivated charcoal to absorb contaminants. But like a sciencefiction movie in which the monster only seems dead, somethingharmful apparently was still lurking. Mr. Raker's plantproduction now appears normal, but he claims he saw signs ofBenlate-associated plant sickness at least twice after hequit using the fungicide.   Studies by a horticulture expert, David Koranski of IowaState University, indicate the unknown toxic agent somehowadheres to surfaces of things in areas where Benlate has beensprayed. Research indicates its toxicity is amplified byheat, light and humidity, he says.   The culprit might be one of Benlate's &quot;inert&quot; ingredients,such as chemicals added to make it easier to spray. Onetheory suggests those ingredients have somehow interactedwith the fungicidal chemical, says Dr. Davidson of theUniversity of Florida. Little is known about inertingredients; chemical companies generally treat them as tradesecrets.   Du Pont says its scientists have found no evidence thatheat, light or humidity make things worse, nor any sign of alingering chemical. But last week, the company committed topay Florida growers for &quot;residual problems&quot; after Universityof Florida researchers presented preliminary evidence thatfoliage-plant growers are having such problems. It continuesto sell a form of Benlate that hasn't caused problems, a&quot;wettable powder&quot;; withdrawn were &quot;dry flowable&quot; versions.   The 1989 case of Benlate contamination with atrazineweed-killer is still haunting Du Pont. A Sioux City, Iowa,firm called Terra International Inc., which used to formulateBenlate for Du Pont, was blamed for the 1989 contamination,and its insurer paid growers about $60 million for what wasassumed to be atrazine damage.   But now, Terra says it has obtained a letter that Du Pontsent to the Environmental Protection Agency in 1989indicating that the low levels of atrazine found inTerra-made Benlate wouldn't have caused the amount of plantdamage growers cited. Terra has sued Du Pont in WoodburyCounty court in Sioux City, seeking reimbursement for damagesTerra paid.   Last week Du Pont countersued in Delaware chancery court,saying it has no reimbursement obligation. Its countersuitsays Terra's suit &quot;has created a crisis&quot; in managing damageclaims in the matter. The chemical company adds that Terra'ssuit &quot;threatens to protract unreasonably a situation which isharmful to the reputation of Du Pont and its products.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
