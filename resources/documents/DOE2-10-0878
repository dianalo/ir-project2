This induced mutant gene is allelicto the semidwarfing gene in DGWG, T(N)1, IR8, and other Green Revolutioncultivars. Six other mutants are non-allelic to sd/sub 1/. To date, noneof these six has been as agronomically useful as sd/sub 1/, but threewarrant further investigation if genetic vulnerability should arise fromwidespread usage of sd/sub 1/. Seedling response of genotypes to exogenousgibberellin (GA) fell into three broad categories: High response (secondleaf sheath length at 10 ppm of GA more than 450% of control), intermediateresponse (300-450%), and low response (less than 300%). The high responsecategory consisted of Tanginbozu and the semidwarf mutant Short Labelle.The low response category consisted of the tall indica cultivar Petaand the tall southern US cultivar Labelle. The remaining genotypes, includingthe semidwarf indica cultivar DGWG, the two tall japonica cultivars Calroseand M5, three japonica semidwarfs with the induced mutant gene sd/sub1/, the indica-japonica derived semidwarf cultivar M9, and the other8 induced semidwarfs, showed intermediate response. The major semidwarfinggene sd/sub 1/, whether derived from induced mutation or from the DGWGsource, does not seem to affect GA-response in japonica backgrounds.In contrast, in indica backgrounds the sd/sub 1/ gene is associated withincreases in GA-responsiveness. The implications of GA responsivenessof semidwarfs in rice breeding remain unclear. (author). 9 refs, 5 figs,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
