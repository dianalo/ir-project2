Fraud bamboozled government and private insurers of about$60 billion last year, or about 10% of the $600 billion spenton health care, says the National Health Care Anti-FraudAssociation in Washington, D.C.   A variety of cheaters bilk insurers by culling informationfrom office computers, such as details about patients andtheir insurance coverage, and then by padding bills withfalse visits, lab tests or X-rays. The potential for suchcrimes is growing, too, as more insurers adopt &quot;paperless&quot;claims, using completely electronic systems.   To ward off fraud, systems such as the one dubbed Robocopat Aetna Life Insurance verify claims and police databases.For example, the computer crosschecks claimant data to flagsuch frauds as a single procedure leading to several claimsin different relatives' names.   About 40% of insurers have launched anti-fraud programs inthe past three years, says a survey by the Health InsuranceAssociation, a Washington trade group. Members investigatedabout 19,600 cases in 1989, up 56% since 1987, saving $48million.   Culprits include doctors, patients, employees and outsidehackers. Everyone, says Richard Ekfelt, director of theanti-fraud group, &quot;from welfare clinics to Beverly Hillspsychiatrists.&quot;   About 3% of the nation's doctors &quot;routinely&quot; commit fraud,claim the insurers. The American Medical Association says ithas become more &quot;militant,&quot; throwing out 39 physicians lastyear, the first such expulsions. &quot;There will be more tocome,&quot; promises President C. John Tupper.   Government Isn't Paying   Its Tab, Firms Complain                                                                                                          AS health-care costs continue to soar, companies andhospitals complain that Uncle Sam isn't paying his fairshare. But whether they'll push the government to act isanother story.   Of every dollar paid by businesses for health care, 11cents results from Medicare and Medicaid shortfalls, chargesthe American Hospital Association in Chicago. The group saysprivate payers shouldered about $2 billion in Medicare and $3billion in Medicaid shortfalls last year.   The business community is beginning to do &quot;low-key&quot;lobbying, says a U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokesman. Butthere is &quot;institutional gridlock,&quot; he warns, among groupswith different interests, and businesses worry about pushingthe U.S. too hard, for fear taxes will go up.   Still, there's plenty of incentive for action. Employerssaw per-employee health-care costs climb 67% between 1986 and1989, says Foster Higgins, a consulting firm. More than 43%of hospitals had operating losses in 1988, and that trendcontinues, says the Healthcare Financial ManagementAssociation, Westchester, Ill.   The government, meanwhile, begs to differ. The Health CareFinancing Administration, the agency that establishesreimbursement rates, says payments are adequate. &quot;We have nodata to indicate&quot; anyone else is picking up the tab, says aspokesman.                                                                                                          Sometimes Less Is More   In Hospital Storerooms                                                                                                          MEDICAL CENTERS are reaping surprising savings from&quot;stockless inventories&quot; in the latest twist on the Japaneseconcept of just-in-time delivery.   In stockless systems, vendors bring ready-to-use suppliesright to closets, nurses' stations and operating rooms.Hospitals keep just a 24-hour reserve, instead of enormouswarehouses, and orders are sent electronically to one or twovendors, who deliver 95% of supplies in 12 to 18 hours.   By contrast, the typical 500-bed facility may spend about$850,000 a year on supplies, but hoard as much as six timesthat amount of inventory throughout the hospital. And theyoften have hundreds of vendors making deliveries.   Hospitals find that treating inventory problems yields awhole range of savings. &quot;It's like the level of water in alake,&quot; says Ned L. Gerber, health-care consultant at Coopersandamp; Lybrand in Chicago. &quot;As the inventory level comes down, allof the junk and problems that had sunk to the bottom areexposed.&quot;   With an investment of about $250,000 in computer support,Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn.,slashed inventory by about $2.8 million and operating costsby about $270,000 annually, including cutting 27 supply jobs.An 18,000-square-foot warehouse formerly used for centralsupplies is now earmarked for neurology and pulmonarydiagnostic centers.   Still, just 30 to 60 hospitals in the U.S. now use someform of stockless inventory. Analysts say only one-third ofthe nation's 6,000 hospitals can make the switch. Otherhospitals find their options limited if they are too far frommajor distribution centers, don't have sophisticatedcomputers or can't find the right vendors.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE INSURANCE industry wants to put more medical alertbracelets and necklaces on corporate employees. The MillionDollar Roundtable, a trade group of agents, gave a $30,000grant to Medic Alert, a nonprofit group that supplies warningaccessories. They clue emergency staff to allergies, rareblood types, heart disease and other conditions that affectone in four employees. . . . A survey showed that 73% of topexecutives think drug abuse, acquired immune deficiencysyndrome and aging will push up health-care costs at least20% each year until 1993, says Noble Lowndes, an East Orange,N.J., benefits firm.</TEXT></DOC>
