(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three Soviet MiG-17 fighter jets roaredover New Mexico, tracked by the whirling arms of Chinese-builtearly-warning radar hidden in a canyon.   It was only a test.   ``We want to understand what the guy we're up against can do,what his equipment can do,'' Dave Tracy, director of the DefenseDepartment's Defense Test and Evaluation Support Agency, saidMonday.   The agency is testing Soviet, Chinese and Warsaw Pact militaryhardware at Kirtland Air Force Base just outside Albuquerque thismonth to see how well it works, how long it takes to do its job andwhat problems turn up, said Defense Department official JamesWilson.   In Monday's test, the MiG-17s flew south from Kirtland into thepinon-studded Manzano Mountains, where the radar waited. Down fromthe radar site were antenna fields, trailers with technicianspeering into scopes and simulated artillery sites.   U.S. A-7 attack jets from the New Mexico Air National Guard tookto the air to determine how quickly they could be picked up on theChinese radar and how swiftly an alert could be relayed to ananti-aircraft missile site, Wilson said.   The agency plans to use its foreign equipment to find out howwell U.S. hardware performs. For example, officials said, testsmight find out how easy it is to detect a new U.S. jet on Sovietradar.   The agency has spent the past year gathering Warsaw Pactequipment ranging from radios to radar and from tracked vehicles tofighter aircraft. Tracy and Wilson declined to say how the UnitedStates acquired the hardware.   Much of the equipment was displayed Monday at a Kirtland hangar.Outside were MiGs and a troop transport plane; inside were tablescovered with radios and the components needed to keep them working,as well as operating manuals written in Russian.   While the MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters are older versions of whatSoviet pilots now fly, they remain in the air as part of the forcesof such countries as Cuba, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, EastGermany, Egypt and India, Tracy said.   ``Just because it looks little and small doesn't mean it can'thurt you,'' he said.   The Soviet and Chinese radios on display, used by Warsaw Pactcountries, don't have the modern microchips found in U.S.equipment, but instead use vacuum tubes _ technology developed inthe 1940s and 1950s.   But what the equipment lacks in techological sophistication, itmakes up for in simplicity, Tracy said. Such radios are easy tomaintain, easy to use and very tough.   Vacuum tubes are also less susceptible to the electromagneticpulses that would follow a nuclear detonationo and disruptcommunications and power, Tracy said.   ``They are prepared to operate in a nuclear environment morethan we thought,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
