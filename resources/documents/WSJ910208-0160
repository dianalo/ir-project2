The defense contractor expects to report that net incomefell to about $1.3 million, or 29 cents a share, from $1.7million, or 34 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.Per-share figures reflect a reduction in average sharesoutstanding to 4.5 million shares from five million due to astock buy-back program.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Rand said the defense contractor expects to reportthat fourth-quarter revenue stayed about &quot;even&quot; with the $29million reported a year earlier. The income decline reflectslower operating margins due to rising costs for personnel andmedical benefits, as well as continuing efforts to developnew commercial product lines and bid on additional federalprograms.   Mr. Rand said the company expects to report that netincome for the full year fell about 11% to $3.2 million, or68 cents a share, from $3.58 million, or 71 cents a share.Average shares outstanding for the year were 4.9 million,down from 5.1 million.   In the year, revenue was &quot;up slightly&quot; to almost $90million, about 1.6% above the $88.5 million reported in 1989,Mr. Rand said. &quot;We did a lot better in defense sales than I'danticipated&quot; a year ago, he said.   Mr. Rand declined to make a specific prediction aboutresults for 1991. He said that due to the Pentagon'spreoccupation with Persian Gulf activities, &quot;everything seemsto have moved off three to six months&quot; in terms of awardingnew contracts. But, he added, &quot;we're very optimistic rightnow. We're looking for a growth improvement.&quot;   Dynamics Research gets about 90% of its revenue fromgovernment contracts. Most of that comes from three bigcontracts: maintaining software that records performance andmaintenance records for the Navy's Trident submarine program,the Air Force's F-16 fighter planes and the Air Force'sHanscom Field operations in Massachusetts.   Mr. Rand said that he had feared that one of the threemight be cut back, but now all seem solidly in place, as dofive other major contracts. Now, he said, &quot;we have five orsix more&quot; potential contracts that could be awarded sometimethis year.   Those include work for the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's space station project and the FederalAviation Agency, both of which would expand Dynamics'business outside the defense industry.   Despite the likelihood of continuing Pentagon cutbacks,&quot;there is business out there,&quot; Mr. Rand said.   James Pablo, chief financial officer, said that Dynamics'&quot;financial ratios continue to improve steadily.&quot; He said thecompany doesn't have any debt. Last year, cash flow fromoperations rose to $4.5 million from $3.5 million the yearbefore, he added. Dynamics spent about $2.3 million on itsstock buy-back of 500,000 shares last year. The board hasauthorized the repurchase of an additional 250,000 shares.</TEXT></DOC>
