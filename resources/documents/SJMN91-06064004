Certainly, none of the &quot;experts&quot; predicted how quickly thefragmented Arab nations would coalesce into a regional economic cooperative inthe turbulent aftermath of the 1991 gulf war.;    &quot;Throughout history, peoplehave been surprised by which nations went ahead and which ones were leftbehind,&quot; economist Mancur Olson noted 15 years ago. &quot;Voltaire once said: 'TheGermans will always be poor.' Ultimately, it's the institutions that countrieshave that determine how well they do. There does appear to be some sociallearning between nations. Stable and efficient institutions are key.&quot;;    TheArabs have obviously learned. The gradual transformation of Kuwait and SaudiArabia into constitutional monarchies was crucial. The U.S.-inspired plan forthe Arabian Bank for Reconstruction and Development to reinvest petrodollarswithin the region proved crucial to infrastructure investment. To this day,the Saudis and the Kuwaitis privately joke about the &quot;Ministry of Bechtel.&quot;;   But, beyond doubt, the turning point occurred with the 1993 signing withJapan of the Abbasid Agreements. They marked the first comprehensive effort tocreate a regional climate for growth. While craving Western technology, theIslamic societies still distrusted Western cultural influences. Japan -- thenas now, Saudi Arabia's largest customer -- opportunistically exploited theopening.;    In exchange for a stable supply of cheap petroleum, Japan agreednot only to transfer technology but also to invest in manufacturing facilitiesin the poorer Arab nations. The Japanese reportedly clinched the deal whenminister-without-portfolio Shintaro Ishihara told an assembly of sheiks andmullahs: &quot;Look at what we now own in America; the best way to conquer Israelis to surround it with wealth and buy it. Patience plus profits equal power.&quot;;   A conclave of the region's leading mullahs and Islamic scholarssubsequently called for a &quot;renaissance and rebirth of Islam's historicleadership in divining the ways of Allah to enrich the lives of hisfollowers.&quot; In essence, science and technological development were declaredcompletely compatible with the teachings of Islam.;    The groundbreaking forthe first Toyota plant in Iraq occurred three years later as part of thisnation's mass reconstruction. In Yemen today, workers at the new Mitsubishilight truck assembly plant are so excited about its prospects that they don'tstart chewing their khat -- the Yemeni national narcotic -- until after the5:30 whistle instead of lunchtime. The Europeans and Chinese are now callingfor Arab automobile import quotas.;    &quot;We have almost come as far as Japandid in almost half the time,&quot; boasts Tarik ibn Mustafa, a Stanford UniversityMBA who is general manager of Sony's computer memory chip facility in Basra.;   Since the gulf war, the region's gross national product has nearlyquadrupled -- a rate that easily exceeds Taiwan's unprecedented growth duringthe 1960s. Part of that is because of the careful petroleum pricing policies.The gulf oil states have now sufficiently diversified into petrochemicals andspecialty chemicals that they want to eliminate price spikes.;    The IslamicEconomic Alliance has become so integrated into the rest of the world'seconomy through trade and equity investment that providing a stable supply ofoil at a moderate price has proved the wisest and wealthiest of strategies.;   Make no mistake: The Middle East is still different. The invisible hand inthe market is Allah's, not Adam Smith's. The point of the market is not tomaximize wealth but to live up to the tenets of the Koran. Where the Koranforbids the charging of interest, Islamic scholars, bankers and entrepreneursare quite comfortable calling it &quot;profit sharing.&quot;;    There will always betensions between the fundamentalists and the secularists -- but the tensionshere seem more bearable with an automobile, a VCR and a desert blooming withproduce.;    The lesson is clear: Given the right blend of political freedom,cultural orientation and market-sensitive government institutions, economicgrowth can accelerate anywhere in the world.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Michael Schrage column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Baghdad, Iraq (February 2006)  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910304  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  743  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 4, 199100064004,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
