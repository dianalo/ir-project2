Distribution Centers </HL><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR FLM </CO><DATELINE> OKLAHOMA CITY  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fleming Cos. said members of the Teamsters walked off the job at four of its 45 distribution centers and set up picket lines in sympathy with striking workers in northern California.    The California workers have been on strike since June 9 after the company and the workers failed to reach agreement on a new contract. The union said it couldn't agree on a contract with Fleming because the company wanted to cut wages at the Fremont, Calif., distribution center. Fleming said it sought lower wages because the Teamsters had recently granted a competitor in the area a contract with wages lower than it was paying.    A spokeswoman said workers at 13 of Fleming's distribution centers are now on strike, or about 3,700 of its 26,000 employees. The company said about 9,900 of its workers are affiliated with a union, most with the Teamsters.    International officials at the Teamsters' warehouse division in Chicago weren't available for comment. But Charlie Thompson, president of the Teamsters local in Oklahoma City, said the walkouts at the four additional locations were called by the Teamsters' international leadership.    Fleming said about 2,100 workers in California and 780 workers in Oklahoma City; Joplin, Mo.; Kansas City, Kan.; and San Antonio, Texas, are affected by the strike. The food distributor said it considers the sympathy strikes in violation of the contracts in effect at those locations and said it has begun to hire workers to replace the strikers.    But Mr. Thompson said the strikes are &quot;clearly&quot; allowed by the contract between the Teamsters and the company. &quot;We have that right; we're on solid legal footing,&quot; he said.    The new walkouts are in addition to walkouts by 825 workers in two distribution centers in Philadelphia earlier this month. Some of those workers have been replaced with newly hired workers, and the company has reopened the warehouses and begun to distribute some food from them, the company said. The centers had been closed and customers were being served by other distribution centers.    The company said it anticipates that it will be able to continue serving customers from its four Midwestern centers affected by the strike using administrative personnel and new workers. </TEXT></DOC>
