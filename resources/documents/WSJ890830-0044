With a pivotal meeting of the oil ministers only three weeks away, OPEC production has risen to its highest level so far this year. It's also nearing the level that caused oil prices to plunge last fall, according to the outside firms that track OPEC's output.    But, for the moment, oil markets still appear to be absorbing the excess OPEC production with prices of the world's crudes holding around $4 a barrel higher than those of a year ago.    In fact, prices increased yesterday on European spot markets. They were up 10 cents to 15 cents a barrel, leaving North Sea crudes valued at around $17 a barrel. But in U.S. futures trading, prices were flat to down. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery was unchanged for the day, settling at $18.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.    OPEC's production has been surging since a June ministerial meeting agreed on an offical second-half output ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day. Actual output is seldom within the ceiling, but had been expected to hold below the 21 million barrels a day of the second quarter.    Instead, it has moved higher. Although estimates vary widely, leading monitors of OPEC's output measured July production at 21.3 million to 21.5 million barrels a day. Now, most estimates for August are showing a jump of some 300,000 barrels a day beyond the July level.    August output will average &quot;fractionally under 22 million,&quot; said Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva.    OPEC production followed a similar pattern last year -- with a second-half surge -- but it didn't reach 22 million barrels a day until October. That same month, falling prices of crude bottomed for the year, with West Texas Intermediate below $13 a barrel. OPEC output didn't reach its 1988 peak of 23 million barrels a day until December. Few in the industry expect production to get that high this year if Saudi Arabia, the OPEC kingpin, continues to abide by its quota. But there is little evidence of any slowdown in this year's rise in production, although Kuwait, a major quota violator, has reduced its output some.    &quot;September production looks similar to August, perhaps a little higher,&quot; said Cristina Haus, an analyst who follows OPEC output for OPEC Listener, an oil-industry analysis service. She estimates August output at 21.6 million to 21.7 million barrels a day. Her estimate doesn't include some 300,000 barrels a day of Iraq's production that's being used to fill an export pipeline that isn't open yet.    Next month's meeting of the oil ministers is intended to adjust the production ceiling for the fourth quarter, probably by raising it to a more realistic level of 20 million or 20.5 million barrels a day. Still, some oil ministers are concerned about the current output level. The oil ministers of Algeria and Libya yesterday announced plans to step up contacts with others in OPEC regarding &quot;the danger threatening the unity and solidarity of the organization&quot; from the current high production.    However, the excess production doesn't seem to be causing much of a problem for the oil markets so far. Those who track OPEC production say there are buyers for the oil and that very little of it seems to be going into producer-owned storage.    &quot;If it were a really big surplus, we would see it stacking up in tankers, and there are no indications of that,&quot; said Edward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis, a Washington firm that monitors oil supplies world-wide. Still, he said, the high OPEC output is likely to lead to &quot;an increase in stock levels which could create a difficult situation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
