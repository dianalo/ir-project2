SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> INTC TXNELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN><TEXT>   Intel Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. have agreed to swap semiconductor designs and manufacturing technologies for developing customized chips, as well as rights to act as alternate chip suppliers for each other.    The planned technology exchange will bolster both companies' efforts to take the lead in the burgeoning market for application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which combine the functions of several types of computer chips on a single chip. It is the fastest-growing segment of the recovering semiconductor industry, with world sales estimated by market analysts to reach $5 billion a year in 1990 -- accounting for a projected 15% of all chip sales.    &quot;What Texas Instruments and Intel are trying to do is put together a catalog of standard building blocks for computers and electronic systems that customers can pick from and easily put on a single chip,&quot; says William Groves, vice president of InStat Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based semiconductor industry market analysis concern. &quot;It gives both companies access to semiconductor technology that would be very expensive, or impossible to duplicate on their own.&quot;    Specifically, Texas Instruments customers will be able to incorporate designs from Intel's library of microprocessor and controller chips -- including Intel's well-known 8080, 8086, 80286 microprocessors -- into custom-made chips using Texas Instrument's own designs. And Intel customers will have access to Texas Instrument's library of standard cells that handle internal logic functions. Once an ASIC is designed, customers will be able to ask either company to manufacture the chip.    &quot;It's going to be a very customized world in the long run,&quot; says William McClean, a semiconductor industry analyst for Integrated Circuit Engineering Corp. &quot;It's a sign of the times,&quot; that such recognized industry leaders have entered into a technology sharing agreement.    The combined library of standard designs, or cells, will make it tough for other, smaller ASIC companies that don't have access to such widely used designs, but who until now had a wide-open market.    From the customer's point of view, the real benefit of this technology sharing agreement &quot;is on the second round of buying,&quot; says Mr. Groves. &quot;Once the ASIC is designed, he can play the companies off each other to get the best price.&quot;    According to Jack C. Carsten, Intel's senior vice president and general manager of ASIC operations, the technology exchange is a response to customers' concerns that an individual custom chip maker -- even one as large as Intel or Texas Instruments -- couldn't always be counted on to make enough chips. &quot;Now when a customer comes to one of us, they know the other can be a source as well.&quot;    Executives of both companies indicated that the arrangement won't run afoul of federal antitrust laws, despite the exchange of technology and manufacturing techniques to make duplicate products. &quot;If anything, we believe it will promote competition,&quot; says Wally Rhines, senior vice president of Texas Instruments' semiconductor group.    In Washington, Justice Department officials said they weren't familiar with the plan and didn't comment on whether it posed any antitrust concerns.    For Texas Instruments, the agreement is one of its first major announcements to flesh out a business strategy the company outlined in December, emphasizing alliances with other semiconductor makers.    Intel is an obvious choice in that strategy, analysts said, because Texas Instruments' line of semiconductors is weakest where Intel's is strongest. Intel's strength is in microprocessors like the 80286, which perform the main operations of personal computers. Texas Instruments is a major maker of memory chips, which store information, as well as ASICs.    This is Intel's second technology-exchange agreement to help it break into the ASIC business, a market it only recently targeted. Last fall, International Business Machines Corp. agreed to swap design libraries and provide design tools to Intel to build ASICs, combining functionality of IBM's chips with Intel's special features. As a bonus, Texas Instruments also will have access to those IBM designs.    Intel, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip maker has been known for making general purpose computer chips in huge quantities, a strategy that requires long lead times to work out designs and production methods.    The market for ASICs currently is fragmented. Dozens of the estimated 200 or so ASIC concerns are custom design companies that simply provide chip layouts and contract with other companies to actually produce the chips. Others, such as the U.S. unit of Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., work closely with U.S. computer makers to design chips, and make them at home in Japan.    According to Integrated Circuit Engineering Corp. estimates, Dallas-based Texas Instruments last year was the single largest maker of ASICs based on &quot;standard cell&quot; designs, ringing up $74 million in sales. Intel, which just entered the business late last year, wasn't a significant player. Overall, other market analysts estimate last year's ASIC sales at $2.2 billion, accounting for 11% of the world market.    Both companies rank among the world's ten largest makers of semiconductors, and are among the top three in the U.S. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Texas Instruments shares closed unchanged yesterday at $59.125. Intel shares dropped 50 cents, to close at $44.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
