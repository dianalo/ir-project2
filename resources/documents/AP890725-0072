It was the first protest reported since themovement was suppressed in early June.   At least 300 Beijing University students gathered outside theirdormitories Sunday night to sing sarcastic renditions of patroiticsongs and to mourn those who died in the crackdown, said studentswho participated.   They also were protesting that some work units, especially ingovernment offices, have rejected some students assigned to workfor them after expressing doubts about the students' ideologicalpurity, the students said.   After about an hour, the students marched to the campus areawhere students had put up thousands of political posters during thespring democracy movement, said the participants.   They sang and beat pots and pans to mourn classmates who werekilled June 3-4 when troops opened fire on student protesters andtheir supporters, the students said.   China has said nearly 200 people died, but Chinese witnesses andWestern intelligence sources said the death toll may have been ashigh as 3,000.   One student said some young teachers, housed in a dormitory nextto the poster area, joined Sunday's protest and lit firecrackersbefore the head of the school's Communist Party office ordered themall to go home.   The student said school officials are investigating those whoparticipated in the two-hour event, but no one had been punishedyet.   He said seniors, the only ones left on campus now, feeloppressed by the monthlong ideological study classes they have beenforced to attend in order to graduate.   ``No one dares to say what he really thinks. We all have to telllies,'' he said.   The student said his classmates on Sunday night sarcasticallysang patriotic songs like ``Without the Communist Party, ThereWould Be No New China'' and repeatedly shouted ``Long Live theCommunist Party.''   In their political education classes, the students must studytop leaders' essays and speeches on the student movement, which thegovernment now calls a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''   After reading and discussion, the students are required to writeessays about what they learned, how their mistaken thinking wascorrected, and what they did during the protests.   The seniors are allowed to graduate only after they havesubmitted an acceptable essay. Students returning in the fall alsowill undergo political education.   Students said the ideological training was not enough to satisfysome work units that the students assigned to them are politicallyacceptable, students said.   No one seemed to know exactly how many students have beenrejected by their work units, but a student said all but one ofthose assigned to the State Security Bureau have been rejected.   Job assignments were made in the spring before the crackdown.Most college graduates are assigned jobs by the government.   One government employee, speaking on condition of anonymity,said he was told to investigate a Beijing University studentassigned to his work unit to see if he had been active in thestudent movement.</TEXT></DOC>
