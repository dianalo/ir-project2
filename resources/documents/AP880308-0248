Michael Dukakis ran awaywith Maryland's Democratic presidential primary Tuesday, while VicePresident George Bush soundly defeated Kansas Sen. Bob Dole in theRepublican contest.   Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes easily overcame two little-knownprimary opponents in his bid for a third term. He will face ThomasBlair, a millionaire newcomer to politics, who beat eight othercandidates for the Republican nomination.   In the Democratic presidential race, with 643 of 1,574 precinctsor 41 percent reporting, Dukakis had 65,527 votes or 45 percent toJesse Jackson's 35,855 votes or 24 percent; Tennessee Sen. AlbertGore Jr. had 15,506 votes or 11 percent; and Missouri Rep. RichardGephardt had 12,024 votes or 8 percent.   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart finished with 5,713 votes or 4percent; and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon tallied 4,740 votes or 3percent.   In the Republican primary, Bush gathered 25,870 votes or 54percent to Dole's 14,643 votes or 31 percent, with 426 of 1,574precincts or 27 percent reporting.   New York Rep. Jack Kemp and former TV evangelist Pat Robertsonwas next with 3,260 votes or 7 percent, followed by New York Rep.Jack Kemp with 2,861 votes or 6 percent.   Bush won despite a late effort by Dole that included a day ofcampaigning by the Kansas senator in what his staff considered oneof his better Super Tuesday states.   At stake were 41 GOP delegates and 67 Democratic delegates.   Sarbanes' opponents in the Democratic primary were A. RobertKaufman, 56, a socialist who wants to use the campaign as aplatform to express his concerns about the economy and social illsin the United States, and B. Emerson Sweatt, 44, who says he hasmasterminded federal drug control efforts since 1970, is owed $6million by the federal government and claims to be the only man onEarth with a ``valid legal right to subpoena the entire Congress totestify in a civil suit against the government.''   Blair, a Montgomery County millionaire who had never run foroffice, was the pre-primary favorite.   Maryland got scant attention from the presidential contendersdespite the switch to Super Tuesday from the traditional Mayprimary, which Democratic leaders hoped would help the state play abigger role in the nominating process.</TEXT></DOC>
