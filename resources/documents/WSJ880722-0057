Throughout the area, economic decline has predominated in this decade, becoming a prime issue for opposition candidates. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of a left-wing coalition, placed a strong second in Mexico's July 6 elections, arguing that onerous debt payments were the cause of Mexico's stagnation.    Several other left-leaning politicians, including Peronist leader Carlos Saul Menem in Argentina, Venezuela's Carlos Andres Perez and Brazil's Leonel Brizola are basing their thrusts for power on a message that debt servicing condemns their countries to more misery. All three are favored to win presidential races before the end of next year.    But whatever the election results, calls by these men for debt relief will be a focus of debate in campaigns fought against a background of high inflation, falling real wages and economic stagnation.    Moreover, like the Mexican government of Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado, the administrations of the region's two other largest debtors, Brazil and Argentina, will be hard pressed to counter populist appeals. Their faltering attempts to balance budgets, slash the state sector and open economies to foreign competition may have laid the basis for growth, but have as yet produced none. The reforms have been much more popular with U.S. officials than with local people who must live with their immediate effects on jobs and living standards.    &quot;We're going to have to worry about the politics more than in the past,&quot; says a New York-based U.S. banker. Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs argues that &quot;anyone watching Latin America can see the region going sour. On the debt, if on nothing else, Mr. Cardenas is right.&quot;    Certainly, many Mexicans think so. Mr. Cardenas's stunning success in this month's presidential election, when he took close to a third of the vote and loosened the traditional stranglehold of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, illustrated that attacking debt payments wins votes. The delicate dilemma faced by Mexican President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari is shared by other political moderates in the region.    As budget minister, Mr. Salinas was the architect of market-oriented reforms approved by the U.S. Treasury and the International Monetary Fund. Some state companies have been sold to the private sector, import tariffs lowered, foreign investment encouraged. A serious attempt has been made to cut public spending and the federal deficit. Inflation, for the moment, has been lowered.    He has vowed to continue these policies as president but has scant room for maneuver. The election outcome makes him the weakest Mexican president to take office in 50 years. He will be under pressure to produce economic growth soon to assuage popular discontent and stem an apparent drift leftwards. But there is widespread disillusionment with the fact that the economy hasn't grown for six years. And Mr. Cardenas is suddenly there to channel it.    &quot;Mr. de la Madrid paid the internal price for good relations with foreign creditors,&quot; says political scientist Lorenzo Meyer. &quot;Mr. Salinas doesn't have the political capital to do so.&quot;    The president-elect is aware of his predicament. &quot;If we don't grow because of the weight of the debt, we don't pay,&quot; he said two months ago in a speech in the northern city of Monterrey. Chief debt negotiator Angel Gurria says that &quot;with growth now being an imperative, anything standing in the way of it will take second place.&quot;    He adds that means must be found to cut about $2 billion from Mexico's annual $8 billion interest bill, equivalent to about 7% of the total value of goods and services Mexico produces, to lay a solid basis for investment and the 4%-5% annual growth in the 1990s sought by Mr. Salinas.    Neither Mr. Gurria nor the president-elect favors confrontation with creditors. A new debt-for-bond swap, more flexible than the one that reduced Mexico's debt by a disappointing $1.1 billion earlier this year, is being prepared. The idea is to take advantage of the discount at which Mexican debt trades in secondary markets to get banks to tender their loans in return for a smaller amount of bonds.    Mr. Gurria is trying to persuade Western governments to guarantee part of the interest on these bonds, making them potentially more attractive than the earlier swap in which only principal was backed by the U.S. The aim is to cut the debt by several billion dollars.    The Mexicans see this offering as a crucial test of whether governments, banks and debtors can work together to lessen the debt load enough to make room for growth. If it fails there will be tough choices, which nobody wants to anticipate. But Jose Juan de Olloqui, general director of Banca Serfin S.N.C., Mexico's third-largest bank, says, &quot;I think Mr. Salinas is prepared to take a harder line.&quot; A PRI veteran with close government contacts, he believes there is agreement that payments must be brought down to about 5% of gross national product.    Mexico, with its new political uncertainties, will be watched closely throughout the region. Bordering the U.S., it is seen as a litmus test of government determination to obtain debt relief. Latin American leaders will meet in Uruguay in October to review the debt situation.    If Mr. Salinas can get a breakthrough, it may not only weaken Mr. Cardenas, but also bolster moderates in Brazil and Argentina as they confront the challenge next year of Mr. Brizola and Mr. Menem. That in turn could reinforce democracy in the area by pre-empting tensions between left-leaning populist leaders and the armed forces. And if growth occurs in Mexico it would demonstrate that tough adjustment programs can work in heavily indebted countries other than Chile, where a dictatorship has kept a lid on popular discontent.    Even if Michael Dukakis becomes president, U.S. bankers and analysts are skeptical that any debt-relief program to help spur growth could be agreed to before the end of next year. &quot;The Democrats would not produce a quick bail-out,&quot; says one banker. &quot;It would take at least a year to look at regulatory questions.&quot; Moreover, banks are divided, with some aggressively reducing exposure because of a pessimistic long-term view and others working on the assumption that the debt will be fully paid. The best bet, most argue, is for Mexico's swap plan to prove a success and provide the basis for another year of muddling through and gradual improvement.    But, as Mr. Salinas prepares to take office in December, it isn't clear this would be enough for him to get the economy moving and so forge political stability, or to prevent a leftward, populist lurch in the region as a whole.    ---                Latin America's Major Debtors                                                  INTEREST                              TOTAL DEBT*      PAYMENTS AS                             (In billions       PERCENTAGE                              of dollars)       OF EXPORTS** Argentina                          $62.7            41.3% Brazil                             120.2            30.1 Chile                               21.5            17.9 Colombia                            17.7            21.2 Ecuador                             11.1            27.9 Mexico                             107.3            27.9 Peru                                18.8            37.5 Venezuela                           34.7            23.4 *1988 year-end forecast **Estimated   Source: Institute of International Finance, Washington</TEXT></DOC>
