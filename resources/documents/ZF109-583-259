 But the world is changing.andP;  UNIXhas a new ally; the X Window System.andP;  UNIX gave us the ability to writeprograms that are portable across a multitude of hardware platforms.andP;  The XWindow System allows us to give these programs a graphical user interface,without sacrificing portability.andM;It also gives us a new way to interact with UNIX, one which is familiar toall Macintosh users.andP;  Window systems and GUI's have been available for UNIXfor some time.andP;  The big difference is that X is non-proprietary and runs onalmost any UNIX system.andM;The two products reviewed this month, Looking Glass (Visix Software Inc.,andO;Reston, VA) and X.desktop (IXI Ltd., Cambridge, England), are desktopmanagers.andP;  A desktop manager is the graphical analog to the UNIX shell.andO;Among its tasks are: starting applications, organizing files (copying,moving, and deleting them), creting directories, opening files (for editing),and changing file information.andM;They key difference is that, instead of typing commands at shell prompt, allactions re performed by directly manipulating graphical objects thatrepresent files and directories.andP;  Insted of typing mv foo.c dir, you click onthe icon for foo.c, drag it on to the icon for dir, and let go.andP;  Voila, yourfile has been moved!andM;So what is the role of a desktop manager?andP;  Why, you may ask, do we need one?andO;Most readers of UNIX REVIEW are probably quite content with the shell.andP;  Oneanswer (and probably the best) is to make UNIX easier to use, and thus moreaccessible to more people.andP;  UNIX (with X at its side) has entered a new era.andO;It is no longer just a system for hackers in universities and research labs.andO;In order for UNIX to gain wider acceptance, it needs to be easier to use.andM;A s much as we may love the shell, let's face it, it's a lousy interface forcasual users.andP;  However, in a system as complex as UNIX it is impossible tocompletely replce the shell with something like a desktop manager.andP;  Forinstance, how do you deal with things like pipes and I/O redirection?andM;The challenge is not to just make UNIX easier to use, but to do so withoutcompromising functionality.andP;  A good desktop manager should be easy to use forthe novice, and allow expert users to perform routine tasks quickly and moreefficiently than they could with the shell.andP;  In the paragraphs to follow, wewill see how the two products reviewed meet this challenge.andM;X.desktop and Looking Glass were tested on a Sun Sparcstation 1 (SunOS 4.1)equipped with a color framebuffer, 16 MB of memory, nd a local 600 MB SCSIdisk.andP;  A number of X servers were used, including the MIT X11R4 server, Sun'sOpenWindows 2.0 (xnews) server, and MacX 1.0.andP;  1 running on a Macintosh IIxwith n Ethernet card.andP;  Both products are available for a wide variety ofhardware platforms and UNIX implementations.andP;  In addition, both systems arebeing OEM'd by various hardware and UNIX vendors.andM;InstallationandM;Both products provide shell scripts for installation.andP;  Looking Glass has botha standard and a custom installation.andP;  The standard installation assumes youhave X11 installed in the &quot;standard directories&quot; (such as /usr/bin/X11 and/usr/lib/X11).andP;  The custom installation allows you to specify allinstallation directories (a feature most systems administrators willappreciate).andM;After Looking Glass's installation script copies files and installs fontsinto their proper destinations, the next step involves building the LookingGlass database.andP;  The program db_build will traverse all directories of alllocal filesystems and create a file called .Igdb in each directory.andP;  Thisfile contains file typing information so when Looking Glass enters adirectory for the first time, it won't need to read all the files todetermine what they are (a time consuming process on large directories).andO;Running the db_build program is optional (and takes a long time to run),which explains why it is not part of the install script.andM;The last step is to configure and start the Visix License Server.andP;  Though thedocumentation neglects to mention this, it is advisable to add the licenseserver to /etc/rc.local so it will always be restarted upon a reboot.andP;  Beforerunning Looking Glass, the environment variable VISIX_APPS is set to the pathname of a file containing all the Looking Glass configuration information.andM;X.desktop does not have any installation options.andP;  All files are installed inthe &quot;standard directories.&quot;andP;  If you wish to place things elsewhere, you'llneed to edit the shell script or make symbolic links.andM;The install script takes care of putting things in the right places.andP;  Inaddition, it is used to create some initial configurtion files for X.desktopusers.andP;  It prompts for the login names of those expected to use X.desktop.andO;This step is not necessary since X.desktop will create an initial environmentupon first invocation if one does not exist.andM;DocumentationandM;X.desktop and Looking Glss both provide installation, user, and configurationguides.andP;  The installation guides for both products consist of stapled 8-1/211 sheets of paper with instrucitons on reading the distribution media andrunning the install scripts.andM;The X.desktop users guide and X.desktop configuration guide are provided asseparate documents.andP;  The X.desktop users guide is a short (44 page) documentdescribing basc X.desktop concepts and interaction (such as icons and mouseusage).andP;  Each page describes a single topic.andP;  Text is laid out in columnswith liberal use of graphics.andP;  Overall, it is very eacy to read andunderstand, a big plys for novices.andP;  On the downside, the manual tends to bevague at times (such as, &quot;Because of the limitations of UNIX you may not beallowed to move certain files or directories between some directories.&quot;).andM;The X.desjktop configuration guide is intended primarily for systemsadministrators and advanced users.andP;  It describes how to d o things likeassign icons to file and define acttons for icons.andP;  The tutorial sectionincludes examples all major configuration functions.andP;  This is an excellentsource of ideas on how to go about the configuration process.andP;  the rest ofthe manual describes the rule file syntax and the X.destop command language.andM;The looking Glass users guide covers basic usage and configurationinstructions in a single document.andP;  The introduction briefly describes eachof the Looking Glass windows and icon types (document, directory, andprogram).andP;  Also included is a brief technical overview, containing adescription of how file typing works.andM;The rest of the manual covers the major Looking Glass functions in detail,including the file typing language.andP;  One of the nicest features of the manualis its table of contents.andP;  Just about every function can be fount in it.andO;This is a well written, well organized, easy to understand manual.andM;User InterfaceandM;These products are user interfaces, so this section is the most critical partof the review.andP;  The true test of a good UI is to see how much of the systemcan be learned without referencing the manual.andP;  There will always be advancedfeatures that require use of the manual, but most of the system'sfunctionality should be accessible through experimentation.andM;Now to answer the question that's been burning in all of your minds.andP;  BothX.desktop and Looking Glass claim to be Motif complaint.andP;  Whether or not thisis in fact true I cannot say.andP;  They both appear to be, at least in terms ofthe appearance of the menus and dialog boxes.andP;  However, use of the mouse isdifferent in each system (though I have noticed this inconsistency in everyMotif application I've tried).andM;When you start X.desktop for the first time you get a window called thedesktop window with five icons: Root (a file cabinet), Home (a file drawer),Trash (a trash can), Supplies (a supply cabinet), and Information (an openbook with a question mark).andP;  The root and Home icons represent the rootdirectory and your home directory, respectively.andP;  The Trash icon is where youdrop things you want to get rid of (and possibly recover later).andP;  TheSupplies icon represents a special directory that contains commonly usedapplications: Tar (one icon for tape and one for floppy disk), Printer, Find,and Man.andM;Icon size is a configuration option; the choices are large (64 x 64 pixesl)and small (32 x 32 pixels).andP;  Large icons come with a large cursor that lookslike a hand with a pointing index finger.andP;  Small icons use the typical arrowcursor.andM;My initial impression of the large icons is that they are somewhat gaudy,especially the cursor.andP;  They use too much screen real estate (even on an 1152x 900 monitor) without adding much to the interface.andP;  I find the smallericons to be much more to my liking; they give me the same amount ofinformation in much less space.andM;Mouse interaction with X.desktop works as follows (assuming a three-buttonmouse): double-cliking with the left button on an object opens or executesit.andP;  As it turns out, the actions associated with an object when any of themouse buttons is double-clicked areuser-definable.andP;  Single-clicking with theleft button selects the object (and clears other selections).andO;Single-clicking with the right or middle mouse button toggles the selections.andO;Clicking any mouse button in any open area of the X.desktop window willpop-up a menu.andP;  X.desktop has no menu bars (something found in most Motifapplications).andM;X.desktop supports a drag-and-drop style of interaction--you pick up anobject and drop it on another icon to perform an action.andP;  For instance,dropping a document on the trash can will delete the file, dropping it on theprinter icon will result in the file being printed.andP;  You can also moveobjects around on the desktop by picking them up and dropping them elsewhere.andM;You can move icons of frequently accessed files and directories onto thedesktop window and save the contents of the desktop in a file.andP;  If you areworking on several projects, you can create a desktop for each project andchang the desktop in mid-session.andP;  This is a very nice feature, somewhatreminiscent of the &quot;rooms&quot; concept (a window-management technique originallydeveloped at Xerox PARC).andM;Besides the desktop window, the other type of window in X.desktop is thedirectory window.andP;  This is simply a window representing the contents of adirectory.andP;  Both windows have menus associated with them.andP;  Common to bothmenus are items to select/de-select all icons and get file information.andM;The desktop window has entries for starting applications, saving the desktop,re-organizing the desktop, opening and closing directories, and quitting--arelatively small number of functions.andP;  The directory window menu includesitems that copy, move, or link a file, create a file or directory, sort ofdirectory (by name, time, size, class, or directory first) and change theview from iconic to text.andP;  The file-information dialog box reports thingslike filename, owner, group, and size.andP;  The only items that can be changedfrom the dialog box are the file-mode bits.andM;Overall, X.desktop is a fairly straightforward interface that appears to bewell suited for novices.andP;  There are some problems though.andP;  Real-time visualfeedback is important in a desktop manager, and X.desktop lacks the desiredcrisp response.andP;  It takes about half a second for an object to becomehighlighted (indicating selection).andP;  I find this much too slow and inadequatefor this type of interaction.andM;In X.desktop, selected items are indicated by using reverse video only on theicon's label, instead of highlighting the whole icon (which would give bettervisual feedback).andP;  When dragging an icon, the cursor (when used with largeicons) is set to a hand holding an object.andP;  While this is a nice indicationof what you are doing, you don't get any indication of what object is beingaffected.andP;  Most drag-and-drop interfaces (such as the Macintosh's or theOpenLook file manager) highlight the objects and drag their outlines, so youknow what is being done to which objects.andM;Now let's examine Looking Glass.andP;  When you start Looking Glass for the firsttime, three windows appear on the screen: a global window, a directory windowand a desktop panel.andP;  The global window has a menu bar with five menuslabeled System, Window, Show, Run, and Jobs, and a scrolling panel that isinitially empty.andP;  The directory window also has five menus labeled File,Create, View, Sort, Select, and Run, and two scrolling panels.andP;  One scrollingpanel contains icons representing directories in your home directory, whilethe other contains only files.andP;  The desktop panel is initially empty.andM;My initial reaction is that this is a nicely organized, streamlinedinterface.andP;  I liked the fact that the files and directories are in separatepanels.andP;  The icons were the &quot;right&quot; size (32 x 32 pixels), so space isn'twasted.andM;One thing I noticed immediately click on an icon to open a document or run aprogram you get immediate feedback that the program is started: rectanglesflash, going outward from where you clicked the icon.andP;  Next, an iconrepresenting the application being run appears in the global window with theprocess ID of the application next to it, followed by the command line usedto invoke the program.andP;  This is essentially a visual analog to csh jobcontrol.andP;  You can select jobs and terminate them from the global window (itwouldn't make sense to stop them, since you would just iconify them under X).andM;The Looking Glass desktop window is similar in function to the desktop windowin X.desktop.andP;  It's an area in which you can drop frequently accesseddocuments and folders to quick access, and this is essentially the onlyfunction it serves.andP;  Looking Glass doesn't let you save desktopconfigurations as X.desktop does.andP;  It does keep track of what your desktoplooked like the last time you ran it, including all open windows and theirpositions.andM;Looking Glass doesn't make quite as much use of the drag-and-drop metaphor asX.desktop does.andP;  In X.desktop you can drop a document onto the icon of anapplication (such as tar or emacs) and X.desktop will run the application onthat document.andP;  Looking Glass doesn't support this type of interaction.andO;Operations that are supported in X.desktop by drag-and-drop (such as printingand removing files) are performed through the use of menu items.andM;Looking Glass offers three types of views of files in a directory: iconic,name (rows and columns of just the filenames), and wide.andP;  The wide listing issimilar to doing Is -lagisF.andP;  It includes filenames, modes (broken down byowner/group/world), owners, groups, links, sizes, inode numbers, modificationtimes, types (descriptive text), and link content (for symbolic links).andP;  Thislist can be sorted by filename, owner, group, size, modification time, andtype, in ascending or descending order.andM;As with X.desktop, you may bring up an file information sheet and change themode bits of a file.andP;  Mode bits are displayed graphically, numerically (inoctal), or symbolicly (Is -I output), whereas X.desktop shows only agraphical representation.andP;  Looking Glass allows some other additional fileproperties to be modified as well: name, owner, group, and modification andaccess times.andM;Looking Glass provides an on-line help system.andP;  Help information ishierarchically structured, starting with each of three window types.andO;X.desktop has an &quot;Information&quot; icon on its desktop, but it only serves as aninterface to the UNIX man program.andM;CustomizationandM;Both X.desktop and Looking Glass allow customization of things like colorsand other interface properties.andP;  As I mentioned earlier, Looking Glass iscustomized by using properly sheets accessible from the System menu of theglobal window.andP;  X.desktop uses the X resource manager instead, recognizingover 100 different X resources.andM;All of the cursors may be modified, along with some of the desktop icons.andO;While the X resource manager provides a great deal of flexibility, it can betroublesome for real novices who are only interested in changing things likecolor and fonts.andP;  It was refreshing to find such things easily accessible onmenus and property sheets in Looking Glass.andM;Looking Glass and X.desktop both have the ability to define new types offiles and associate icons and actions to them.andP;  This type of customization isintended for system administrators or advanced users and is done by usingsome type of &quot;rule file.&quot;andM;X.desktop allows for a variety of actions to be specified for a given filetype.andP;  Since drag-and-drop is the primary style of interaction, you maydefine what actions are taken when an icon (or group of icons) are droppedonto an application icon.andP;  A different action may be specified according towhich mouse button is used for the drag.andP;  Actions when multiple files aredropped may be defined as all-at-once or once-per-life.andM;The ability to define actions on multiple files is unique to X.desktop.andP;  Thisallows a considerable amount of flexibility and power in buildingdrag-and-drop interfaces for applications.andP;  In addition, the behavior of thevarious items on the desktop menu may be redefined for a new type of file.andM;Looking glass facilitates multiple actions for a given file.andP;  when an icon isdouble-clicked a default action is initiated.andP;  If the control key is helddown while double-clicking, a dialog box appears with a list of all possibleactions for the selected file.andP;  You can then choose an action or cancel theoperation.andM;Both products allow creation and modification of icons.andP;  X.desktop uses thebitmap program that comes with the core MIT X11 distribution for thispurpose.andP;  This is a plus since there are a number of existing programs thatcan convert icon and image files from other systems (such as SunView) to X11bitmap format.andP;  Looking Glass provides its own icon editor.andP;  Though its iconeditor offers better functionality than bitmap, it does not offer conversionto or from other icon and image file formats.andP;  Looking Glass stores all ofits icons in a single file, which makes matters even worse.andM;Specifying new rules for icons and actions is complicated in both systems.andO;X.desktop has greater flexibility in this area, though it appears to beunderutilized in the default configuration provided by IXI.andP;  One reason forthis is that X.desktop is often sold as part of a complete environment(bundled with a system).andP;  It is IXI's feeling that the OEM should do thecustomization for their environment.andP;  In addition, X.desktop is intended tobe configured by users, not just systems administrators.andP;  The configurationGuide includes good examples on how to do this.andM;Looking Glass, on the other hand, can only be modified globally.andP;  The systemsadministrator (or a user with the proper access permissions) must update thesystem configuration files for Looking Glass.andM;X.desktop includes support for multiple languages.andP;  The current versionincludes English and German.andP;  Language is selected via the LANG environmentvariable, which is the standard mechanism for multi-lingual support in X11.andM;SupportandM;Visix provides support via electronic mail.andP;  Bug reports and suggestions maybe e-mailed to Igbug@visix.uu.net.andP;  For those without e-mail access, writtenproblem reports may be used.andP;  A toll-free number is given on the licenseagreement, though there is no explicit mention of phone support.andM;IXI has technical support centers in England and the United States (throughUniPress in New Jersey).andP;  Phone and fax numbers are provided.andP;  I was unableto find any references to e-mail support.andM;Looking Glass and X.desktop are maturing products.andP;  both are due for a newversion within months of this publication.andP;  Looking Glass 2.0 features willinclude: &quot;relocatable icons&quot; (you can put things where you want instead ofrow/column layout), colorable icons, a tree view of the directory hierarchy,and the option to view/hide hidden (&quot;dot&quot;) files.andP;  The X.desktop feature ofbeing able to save desktop configurations will also be included.andM;X.desktop will be incorporating these new features into version 3.0: aselection of pre-configured desktops (there is only one now), dialog boxesfor customization of colors, fonts and icons, a tree view of the directoryhierarchy, file selection by pattern matching, colored and shape maskedicons, animated icons (such as an open folder icon for open directories), anda verbose file list view (similar to Is-I).andM;X.desktop and Looking Glass are both excellent products.andP;  My feeling is thatLooking Glass is more in tune with UNIX and will be more popular with UNIXveterans.andP;  It comes a lot closer to being a graphical version of the UNIXshell than X.desktop.andP;  Features like process management and handling ofenvironment variables highlight this point.andM;X.desktop takes a different approach.andP;  It's designed to hide UNIX as much aspossible, and uses direct manipulation (drag-and-drop) to perform most of itsfunctions.andP;  I think it is better suited to real novice users, though it hassome very powerful features that make it attractive to expert users as well.andO;X.desktop's rule language appears to have the power to express many types ofactions with a simple drag-and-drop interface.andP;  This power needs to beexploited more by IXI and those who OEM the product.andM;I don't think we'll be getting rid of our friend the shell for some time tocome.andP;  But products like these can definitely augment it by making some ofthose dreary file management tasks easier (and more fun) to deal with.andM;Isaac Salzman, this month's reviewer, works in the Information Sciences Dept.andO;at the Rand Corp.andP;
