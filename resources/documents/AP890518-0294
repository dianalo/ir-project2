Substantially larger corn sales and much higher wheat prices areexpected to push the U.S. farm export value to the Soviet Union``well above'' last year's $2.25 billion, the department's EconomicResearch Service said in its preliminary report.   Exports in 1988 were nearly 2{ times the value of shipments in1987 and were exceeded only in 1979 and 1984, the report said.Further, the United States this year may expand its share of Sovietgrain imports from about 30 percent in 1987 and 45 percent in 1988.   ``Last year, the U.S.S.R. took 12 percent of the value of allU.S. grain and feed exports, and the U.S. share of all Sovietagricultural imports was an estimated 14 percent,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
