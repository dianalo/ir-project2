<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-0921 </DOCNO><TEXT>The slurry-Zn/air battery system has received renewed R andamp; D interest becauseit does not have the shape-change problems of batteries with Zn-plateelectrodes and can sustain higher current densities and specific peakpower than other metal-air battery systems. Additional advantages ofthe slurry-Zn/air battery include safety, low environmental impact, potentiallow cost, and separation of energy density from power density functionsfor design purposes. In this work we present results obtained at theindividual cell level as a basis to estimate the performance of a secondaryslurry-Zn/air battery system. The expected specific energy of such systemshas been increased as a result of the use of capacity-extension additives,which has been one of the major thrusts of this work. 8 refs., 20 figs.,5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
