(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House announced Thursdayit will tell the General Accounting Office that it cannot provideinformation GAO is seeking involving possible illegal activities byGen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater added that theadministration ``will respond ... in an appropriate manner'' if theGAO ``reformulates its request in a manner consistent with itsstautory authority and the legal principles involved.''   Fitzwater said the White House acted on the advice of theJustice Department.   The GAO, acting on a request by Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., andRep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., is making a study of ways thatinformation about drug trafficking by foreign officials influencesdecisions by the United States on foreign policy.   Noriega has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by twofederal grand juries in Florida. The United States has sought, invain so far, to have him removed from power in Panama.   ``The General Accounting Office's request for information onGen. Noriega asks for a broad range of sensitive intelligencematerial, information from open law enforcement files, and materialreflecting the deliberative decision-making process of theexecutive branch,'' the White House spokesman said.   He said administration officials had met with the GAO in aneffort to narrow the request, but the GAO declined to do so.   The White House informed the congressional watchdog agency onJuly 13 ``that we would need to complete a legal review of theissues raised by their request before responding,'' Fitzwater said.   ``The Justice Department has just completed that review and hasconcluded that the subject matter of the request is beyond GAO'sstatutory authority,'' he said.   Fitzwater said that ``consistent with the legal advice we havenow received from the Justice Department, we will be informing GAOthat we cannot participate in the study as currently designed.''   ``The administration is prepared to meet with GAO to discuss thelegal issues involved,'' he said. ``Moreover, if GAO reformulatesits request in a manner consistent with its statutory authority andthe legal principles involved, we will respond to any such newrequest in an appropriate manner.''   In Miami, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakisaccused the administration of ``stonewalling'' the GeneralAccounting Office probe, which potentially could delve intoRepublican nominee George Bush's knowledge about the Noriega case.Administration officials argued they needed time to ``review'' theGAO's requests for information.   ``I think the White House does not want to cooperate becausethey are embarrassed by this. They should be embarrassed by this,''Dukakis said.   Nancy R. Kingsbury, who is directing the study by the GAO,Congress' investigative agency, said the administration's totallack of cooperation is unusual. Past GAO-executive branch disputesfocused on specific documents, she noted.   The order not to cooperate, until further notice, came fromNicholas Rostow, special assistant to the president and legaladviser at the National Security Council, according to Ms.Kingsbury and an administration official, insisting on anonymity.   The White House order apparently will apply through most if notall of the presidential campaign, in which questions have beenraised about Vice President Bush's knowledge of Noriega's allegeddrug trafficking.   Bush has played a central role in the administration's overallanti-drug effort, but has denied having early knowledge orsuppressing evidence about any Noriega ties to the drug world.Noriega for years provided intelligence information to the CIA,which Bush once headed.   The GAO is seeking information from the departments of defense,state, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, the JusticeDepartment and the National Security Council.   ``All executive branch agencies have been instructed by theWhite House not to take any action on your request until variouslegal issues have been analyzed by the administration,'' StateDepartment Comptroller Roger B. Feldman write Ms. Kingsbury earlierthis month. Feldman said that Rostow is ``acting as theadministration's point of contact on this matter.''   Rostow's office said he was not available to comment.   In a letter made public by Alexander, Rostow wrote Ms.Kingsbury: ``your request seeks access to sensitive law enforcementand intelligence files covering a substantial period of time.   ``The request raises important statutory and constitutionalissues. The administration is analyzing them now, and when itsdeliberation is complete, I shall reply further.''   The administration official in California said the GAO mayeventually get some, all, or none of the information it seeks. ``Wehave said we are going to review this and until we do the review,we are not going to turn anything over,'' he said.   Ms. Kingsbury said the Noriega study is part of a largerinquiry, to examine how information about drug trafficking byforeign officials affects U.S. foreign policy decisions.   ``We didn't anticipate'' the trouble with the administration,said Ms. Kingsbury, who is GAO associate director for foreigneconomic assistance programs.   If the stalemate isn't resolved, she said, the GAO can issue a``demand letter'' for the information and go to court in an attemptto enforce it.   She acknowledged the administration has ``wiggle room in areaslike foreign intelligence gathering and law enforcement.''</TEXT></DOC>
