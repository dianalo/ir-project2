 Then, as it emerges from your printer a miracle occurs.andP;  Whatstarted as a form is now a fully relational database.andM;Working with Formbase is simple, but the program is capable of greatcomplexity, both in form design and database creation.andP;  Formbase is the firstof the next round of Windows applications, and any discussion of this newgeneration is based on two words: easy and powerful.andM;Easy, because at every step you see exactly what you are doing.andP;  Everythingis accomplished with interactive direct manipulation or direct selection.andM;Formbase is versatile enough to create an employee database with images.andP;  Itcan easily create, store and manage any kind of forms or data.andM;As a forms design package, it begins with a blank screen where you name sizeand place regions on a form.andP;  Any form can be created with precision usingthe on-screen &quot;measures&quot; information and an adjustable grid to align objects.andO;A starter kit of Bitstream Fontware provides basic fonts for screen andprinter.andM;Invisible captionsandM;Text attributes, shading and colors, as well as backgrounds, borders andimported images can be used to supplement any form design.andP;  Captions can beinvisible or appear above or to the left of a field.andP;  Captions and data canalso be aligned left, right or centred vertically and horizontally.andM;In Formbase, like the real world, every peice of data is associated with aform.andP;  Data can be related and referenced to other forms for consistency andto reduce data entry.andP;  The same information can appear on various reports andforms.andM;For example, when a salesman jots down a customer's name, the productrequested and the quantity; three new bits of data are involved.andP;  And that isall the information Formbase needs to fill out and print an invoice.andM;The ability to see the data in different views is the program's best feature.andO;Reports or additional forms based on the same data appear instantly andeffortlessly -- just select and copy the fields you need from other forms toa new one, and add whatever additional or summary information is necessary.andO;Each user can choose (or design) a view with exactly the information heneeds.andM;For example, using data from the invoice, one view can print a letter to thecustomer which confirms the order and announces current special offers.andM;Another view can create mailing labels or print envelopes.andP;  Later, paymentsare entered in a view which finds all outstanding invoices by customer, and atable view lists receivable by age.andP;  A final form prints statements, bycustomer, listing unpaid invoices.andP;  These views are all created from the samedata -- most with no additional data entry.andM;Formbase forms can contain four types of fields.andP;  First, a data field whichcan hold any entered data, provide a default amount or date, or retrieve datafrom an external source.andM;Numbers, text, date, time and images can be stored as data.andP;  Images can beeither vector or bitmap and are imported using the Windows clipboard.andP;  Thesecond type uses a formula to create or calculate information.andP;  As withExcel, you construct the formula by choosing from a list of over 50functions, as well as field names and operators, in a pick-and-click dialoguebox.andM;The last two types are subforms and sub-tables, which can contain multiplefields and variables of their own.andP;  The sub-table is an ingenious solution,for it can contain many sub-records within a master form.andM;Not only is your invoice free of such field names as &quot;Item 1 Quantity&quot; and&quot;Item 2 Quantity&quot; (etc.), but the sub-table is infinitely expandable.andM;A sub-table of a doctor's database for example, could record the informationabout all of each patient's visits.andP;  A scroll bar can bring any date orprevious ailment with its diagnosis into view.andM;There are also no limitations on the number of fields in a form.andP;  Formbase'slimitations for field size are so large (6K) as to be non-existent.andP;  And sizedoesn't have to be specified in advance.andP;  If there's a need to enter a secondname in your Customer Database's contact field, where only one was expected,you just type it in.andP;  No further adjustments are required.andM;Developing relations between various forms and databases was never easier.andO;In the lookup dialogue box, Formbase shows files and a list of possible&quot;keys&quot;.andP;  Simply click and the link is established.andM;Once the form is finished, Formbase supports passwords which lock the designfrom accidental changes.andP;  Passwords can then be assigned to protectindividual view.andM;Data entry is also fast and efficient.andP;  Individual help messages andvalidation formulae can assist and verify as data is entered.andP;  To enter anorder there's no need to have an invoice on screen, simply an order entryview containing the fields to be entered.andM;Later, when the invoice view is opened, all the information is ready to beprinted.andP;  For largescale data import and export, Formbase reads and writesdBase and Lotus 1-2-3 file formats.andM;The program does not use index or key fields.andP;  Searches are defined byexample, and can include complex &quot;and/or&quot; logic.andP;  Sorts are specified bypicking and clicking on fields.andM;When the sort is completed it is presented as a new database -- so theoriginal is not affected.andM;Formbase 1.0 is terrific, but not perfect.andP;  My biggest complaint is thatviews do not retain their own printer settings.andP;  Macros which record mouseand keyboard are provided, but they would be even more powerful if eachview's menus could be customized with specific macros on pulldown menus.andM;A &quot;reduced view&quot; to see a large form would be helpful, as would a &quot;grabberhand&quot; to move the form about the screen in increments the scroll bar doesnot.andP;  This version supports file-locking for network applications, so thatonly one user at a time has access to a file.andM;When desktop publishing applications were first introduced, it made documentdesign easy, and gave everyone access to the tools that graphic designers hadcarefully guarded.andP;  But professionals worried about the quality of thedocuments produced by those with little or no experience.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
