Is the calm a fleeting stage or a sign of amore permanent reduction in the threat?   Of course, it would be foolish to conclude flatly that thepotential for terrorism is fading. Today's rosy forecast caneasily be followed by tomorrow's unpredicted terroristspectacular. The Middle East still has more than its share ofwould-be terrorists, and some analysts predict they will beheard from again soon.</LP><TEXT>   But some U.S. officials are beginning to speculate thatfundamental political changes in the Middle East may bereducing the terrorism threat. All the main state sponsors ofterrorism in the 1970s and 1980s -- Syria, Iran, Iraq andLibya -- have powerful political reasons to avoidunderwriting terrorism for now.   Attacks could still be staged by just a few operatorsacting on their own. But in the past, the biggest operationshave been pulled off with help or sponsorship from a MiddleEast government, and sometimes with logistical help fromformer Soviet bloc nations in Eastern Europe.   Because Middle East state sponsors may be reconsideringtheir roles, and because the Soviet bloc has been shattered,&quot;the trends in counter-terrorism are really quite favorable,&quot;says one U.S. terrorism-watcher.   The most encouraging sign so far is something that hasn'thappened: Nearly three months have passed since Israel andits Arab neighbors opened historic face-to-face negotiations,and there hasn't yet been a major terrorist incident launchedby the radical Arab forces vehemently opposed to the peaceprocess.   That is a surprise; many U.S. officials expected a surgeof terrorism.   Some analysts argue that this seeming calm is nothing buta mirage. &quot;After a while, the Middle East peace talks aregoing to wane,&quot; says Robert Kupperman, who tracks terrorismat the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Atthat point, he says, groups that now probably are lying lowbecause Syrian leader Hafez Assad is participating in thepeace process &quot;are going to feel far less restrained.&quot; Headds: &quot;None of these people is out of the terrorism business.They're being held at bay by Assad for a while.&quot;   Certainly there are some troubling signs. The Sudan, aNorth African country that hasn't before been identified withterrorism, has been drifting steadily toward the radical Arabcamp. Now it seems to be opening its doors to terroristoperators.   A coming State Department report on terrorism will assertthat in the past year the Sudan has &quot;enhanced&quot; itscooperation with terrorist organizations, including thenotorious Abu Nidal organization based in nearby Libya. Thereport also says that the Sudanese government reportedly hasapproved the opening of terrorist camps.   But elsewhere, the political picture is more positive.Having lost its main benefactor with the decline of theSoviet Union, Syria apparently decided about two years ago tocultivate better ties with the U.S. It is eager to get offthe official U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism. Tobe sure, Damascus continues to provide a home to radicalPalestinian terror organizations that sometimes act againstIsrael. But these groups haven't been as active on theinternational front in the past few years.   Iraq was building stronger ties to terrorist groups justbefore it invaded Kuwait. But in the wake of the Persian GulfWar, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein appears to be lying low inhopes the world community will lose interest in maintaininginternational sanctions against him. Above all, he appearseager to avoid provoking the U.S. and its allies to move backinto Iraq militarily to finish him off.   Iran is dallying with terrorists, but seemingly in alimited fashion. It appears to be sanctioning periodicassassinations of exiled Iranian opposition figures. And justas the Middle East peace talks opened last fall, it hosted aconference of peace foes that brought together the region'smost notorious terrorist leaders.   But there isn't any sign that the conference authorized orordered any action, and many analysts think Iran hosted itmostly to satisfy radical elements inside its own government.Iran was chiefly responsible for the release of remainingU.S. hostages in Lebanon, an act that seemed to signal thatIranian leaders had concluded the principal terror operationin which they were involved hadn't paid off. In fact, Iranwas so eager to be rid of the hostage problem that in the endit paid off the radical cells holding U.S. hostages inLebanon, perhaps as much as $1 million or more per hostage,to release them, U.S. officials said. The payments were firstreported in the Washington Post yesterday.   Meanwhile, Libya appears besieged and defensive, thanks toa combined U.S., British and French political campaign overcharges that Libyan agents blew up a U.S. and a Frenchairliner a few years ago. Libya is scrambling to avoidinternational sanctions or military reprisal, and doesn'tseem eager to let its terrorist clients loose -- at least forthe time being.</TEXT></DOC>
