Since the start of 1987, landlords and developers have persuaded lawmakers in New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma and Utah to pass laws prohibiting rent control, bringing to 15 the number of states with such statutes. In Michigan, where Ann Arbor voters recently defeated a city rent-control proposal, a statewide ban is under consideration.    Despite opponents' contentions that low-income and elderly tenants need rent control in order to get affordable shelter, states are passing the laws to encourage the building of more apartments. Apartment construction has declined 30% since the passage of the 1986 federal tax overhaul, which wiped out tax breaks that had helped prompt the overbuilding. Although there may be a glut now, the states fear they'll face a shortage of apartments within a few years because of the severe drop in construction.    The timing in seeking laws against rent control couldn't have been better. Low rents produced by high vacancy rates -- 14% in Salt Lake City and 20% in Oklahoma City, for instance, compared with 11% nationwide -- helped defuse consumer opposition in most states where the laws recently were approved. Only in New Jersey did the law meet noisy, though futile, resistance. Says Charles Fritts, general counsel for the National Apartment Association: &quot;Rather than fight consumers later, apartment groups are winning while rent control isn't an issue.&quot;    Office-Space Vacancies   Growing in Northeast   NORTHEAST commercial real-estate markets remain among the healthiest in the U.S., but continue to show signs of weakening. Vacancies have risen steadily since 1986 in Philadelphia, Boston and New York.    Overbuilding and the stock-market crash contributed to the softening markets. Developers have been adding greater amounts of office space annually for several years, anticipating that the region's robust economy would fuel corporate growth. But many financial companies now have scaled back expansion plans, leaving unleased much new and planned office space. &quot;The supply is outpacing demand,&quot; says George R. Peacock, chairman and chief executive of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc.    Few, though, suggest the region is headed for problems like the Southwest's. Development in the Northeast is handcuffed by a shortage of developable land. And rigid zoning regulations have helped prevent overbuilding.    ---                      Offices to Rent   Office-building vacancy rates in selected cities in the Northeast                    MARCH 31,      DEC. 31,      DEC. 31,                         1988          1987          1986 Boston                 10.5%          8.3%          8.0% Washington             10.8          10.0          11.0 Philadelphia           10.9          10.7           8.5 New York   Midtown              12.9          10.2           9.8   Downtown             13.0          11.5           9.8   Source: Cushman andamp; Wakefield Inc.   ---   Fair-Housing Groups   Hurt by Funding Cuts   PRIVATE GROUPS that fight housing discrimination are having to close or scale back as funding is slashed. The result: Projects ranging from seminars on housing laws to helping tenants sue landlords have been stymied.   Last summer, the Washington-based National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing closed its doors after the Ford Foundation, its largest supporter, halted funding. The Fair Housing Council of Northern New Jersey says its budget fell to $250,000 this year from $500,000 in 1983 because of cuts in private and federal funds. And in Texas, the Greater Dallas Housing Opportunity Center has all but ceased operating.   &quot;Funding problems definitely are intensifying,&quot; says William R. Tisdale, executive director of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council. Mr. Tisdale and others say the money woes reflect a growing, but mistaken, notion that housing discrimination no longer is a problem. The private funding sources say they're supporting more critical projects, such as economic development.   The cuts are hobbling private fair-housing efforts. In Milwaukee, seminars for lawyers on new developments in housing-bias laws have been scrapped, and publications on housing laws have been reduced.   FHA Raises Loan Ceiling   For High-Cost Areas   FOR CERTAIN consumers, housing has suddenly become more affordable.   The Federal Housing Administration recently raised the ceiling on mortgage amounts it will insure in high-cost urban areas. Lenders tend to accept smaller down payments from buyers using FHA insurance because the agency backs the loan.   The FHA now will insure loans of up to $101,250, which is $11,250 more than the previous limit, for both new and existing houses in certain counties in 16 states and the District f Columbia. Also, in Hawaii the statewide limit was lifted to $151,850 from $135,000. Elsewhere, the ceiling remains at $67,500, except in Alaska, where it stays at $135,000.   Many lenders say the higher loan ceilings should be extended to other parts of the U.S. &quot;The problem of affordable housing goes beyond&quot; the FHA's current target areas, says Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association.</TEXT></DOC>
