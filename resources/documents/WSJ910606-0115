Americanpolicymakers east and west are awakening to the fact thateconomic incentives can improve the environment, just as theylead to other improvements in the quality of life.   In Washington, the Environmental Protection Agency says itwill auction sulfur-dioxide &quot;allowances&quot; as part of the newClean Air Act's crackdown on so-called acid rain. The agencyalso says it will allow companies to get compliance creditfor achieving voluntary -- and often cost-effective --reductions in polluting emissions. Though we were skeptical,to say the least, about the evidence underlying the new curbson power-plant emissions and about much of the rest of theClean Air Act, parts of the law are helpful in fostering apollution-rights approach to solving the perceived problems.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, the smog-control capital, theAir Quality Management District is reconsidering itsdraconian schedule of restrictions on stationary pollutionsources, which reach all the way down to dry cleaners,bakeries and charbroilers. Instead, it would set up anexchange of sorts. A total permit capacity would beestablished for various pollutants, and this level wouldgradually drop to reach the politically desired level ofemissions. The value of permits would correspondingly rise.   If policymakers allow credits for closings, an existingbusiness could decide to &quot;cash out.&quot; Depending on how formala trading mechanism was in place, the owners could sell theirpermits directly to another concern that wished to begin oradd to operations, or deal through brokers as if sellingshares of stock.   Picture trading desks for NOx and hydrocarbons, forexample. We'd always know the price of any kind of pollution.There might be an &quot;escrow&quot; type of period for some oversightof transactions, but after a few hours or days, &quot;licenses&quot; toemit would be transferred. (Federal law does require that newpollution sources install emissions-control technology evenif they acquire such a permit to enter business in a smoggyarea.)   A similar procedure for bigger polluters, such asutilities, already exists in several parts of the country. Ifthe Los Angeles area goes ahead with this concept, andextends it to motor vehicles as well, Southern Californianscould catch their breath and keep their prosperity, too.   The beauty of a market-based approach to unfouling the airis its nod to marginality. By that, we mean the recognitionthat economic decisions are properly made on the margin,where the trade-off between cost and benefit can bedetermined in countless individual instances. The result willbe society's realization of the greatest value for its publicpolicy: Big polluters generating little economic wealth willbe shut first, while secondary sources stemming fromactivities that are of great importance to consumers or acommunity will be spared until last.   If the market approach can be extended to othernatural-resource matters, the nation will realize that muchmore environmental gain at less cost. With tradable pollutionpermits the Superfund and asbestos fiascos might have beenaverted.   The command-and-control wing of the Green lobby will notgive up in the face of mere logic. Scare stories aboutcompanies buying permission to poison babies (or birds orbushes) will air on the TV news. In Los Angeles, there's anuproar over Arco's request for more refining capacity inexchange for having formulated some cleaner gasoline. Eventhe recession's rout of various manufacturing industriesdoesn't give the local left pause in shuttering anothersource of jobs.   Politics surely will blow hot and cold on any rationalapproach to enhancing the environment. But the latest breezefeels pretty good to us.</TEXT></DOC>
