Prices also slumped in London and Frankfurt, undermined by concern about the U.S. presidential election and recent weakness on Wall Street.    Tokyo's Nikkei index, which rose 93.50 points in Saturday's half-day session, closed at 27866.36, down 180.39. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section fell 15.61 points to close at 2129.44. First section volume was estimated at 900 million shares, down from 1.57 billion Friday, the most recent full day of trading. It was the first time a full day's trade has fallen short of the billion-share mark in two weeks.    In early trading in Tokyo on Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell 81.66 points to 27784.70.    Traders said Monday that investors were also encouraged to stay out of the market by reports over the weekend that the secretary to the chairman of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. recanted earlier statements and admitted that he bought shares of Recruit Cosmos Co. before they became available to the public.    &quot;The market went above 28000 again Saturday, so it looks like people decided to take a few profits,&quot; said one trader.    He added that the market appears likely to continue to trade sideways &quot;until the emperor problem goes away.&quot;    Market participants were divided over whether the approach of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election was a factor in Monday's trade.    &quot;Nobody thinks {Republican candidate George} Bush is going to lose,&quot; said one fund manager. &quot;You see it reported all the time that people are waiting for the election, but from the institutional investors' point of view, it doesn't carry much weight.&quot;    Paper and pulp issues were predictably higher, while the rest of the market drifted. Steels were lower after managing to hang on to moderate gains through the morning session.    Paper and pulp issues have risen this year early every time the emperor's condition has taken a turn for the worse. Investors believe that demand for paper would surge if the emperor were to die.    Kobe Steel gained as much as 15 yen before falling back to close 2 yen lower at 755 yen ($6). Nippon Steel fell 15 to 890, while Kawasaki Steel was 20 lower at 1,070.    Among paper and pulp issues, Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp was up 40 to 1,050, while Honshu Paper rose 30 to 1,150, and Jujo Paper was 30 higher at 1,190.    London share prices finished a dull session broadly lower as the market became unsettled by the U.S. election.    The Financial Times 100-share index stayed in negative territory all session, amid concern over polling results during the weekend showing Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis narrowing Vice President Bush's lead. &quot;There's an unspoken fear that Dukakis could actually win,&quot; one market watcher said.    Although most analysts expect Bush to win, few of them were willing to greet that possibility with unbridled enthusiasm.    Market-makers cut prices from the outset to stir up some institutional interest. But there were few takers at the lower levels, as players decided to wait out the U.S. elections.    The 100-share index finished 14.6 points lower at 1819.7. The 30-share index was off 11.3 points at 1474.3. Volume was painfully low, with just 331 million shares traded, compared with 568 million Friday.    Nicholas Knight, managing director of research at Drexel Burnham Lambert in London, said that lower prices were a result of a &quot;vacuum of business&quot; rather than a concerted push lower by players.    However, &quot;given the market's weakness ahead of the election, we should find something positive in a Bush victory while the downside on a Dukakis victory is much less than some people think,&quot; Mr. Knight contended. &quot;Put the two together and it isn't unduly bearish,&quot; he added.    The market's main feature continued to be Lonrho, whose shares closed up 9 pence at 422 ($7.45) in brisk turnover of 13 million shares. The activity followed concerted stake-building by Bond Corp. Holdings amid speculation the Australian-based concern might bid for the U.K. conglomerate.    Frankfurt share prices slumped across a broad front in response to last Friday's decline on Wall Street, brokers said. The DAX index fell 13.89 to 1271.13.    Additional worries about the outcome of the U.S. election also weighed on stock prices, the brokers said. &quot;Many people are reducing their positions to a minimum to await the outcome of the election,&quot; said a broker.    In addition, brokers said that news of a profit decline at one of the country's biggest retail chains, Karstadt, cast a shadow over the market. Profit weakness at a time retail sales are picking up ahead of the Christmas selling season and consumer spending is at a high level generally is considered a particularly bad omen.    Karstadt said its net earnings will be lower than in 1987 despite higher profitability of its subsidiaries. The stock slumped 17 marks to 431 ($241), while Horten, also in the retail sector, was unchanged at 210.    Concerns that the Bonn government might shelve plans to allow Daimler-Benz to take control of the aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm weighed on the auto maker's stock. Daimler-Benz slumped 13.5 to 744.5.    Also in the auto sector, Bayerische Motoren Werke was down 9 to 528.5, while Volkswagen declined 6 to 304.1.    In the banking sector, Deutsche Bank was down 5.5 to 520, while Commerzbank eased 2 to 242.5. Dresdner Bank crept up 0.6 mark to 296.8.    Elsewhere, share prices eased in Amsterdam, Paris, Stockholm and Zurich and were mixed in Brussels and Milan.    Prices closed lower in Hong Kong, Sydney, Wellington and Singapore and were higher in Taipei, Seoul and Manila.
