Jobs, the ``father'' of the Apple II and Macintosh, two of thebiggest selling computers of the PC generation, unveils his NextInc. computer workstation on Wednesday. It's a year late, promptingcritics to dub it ``Eventually.''   Being shown before 3,000 people in San Francisco's posh LouiseM. Davies Symphony Hall, the 2{-hour product demonstration isdesigned to thrill the analysts, convert the doubters and confoundthe competition.   ``There has been a strong pooh-poohing of the Next computer fora long time, a feeling Jobs' company could not come up withanything that could make an impact,'' said Jonathan Seybold, aleading Los Angeles-based trade publisher.   Seybold, who has seen the Next, adds, ``They are all going tochange their minds.   ``From a hardware and software standpoint, this is a remarkableachievement ... and will have a significant impact that will spreadwell beyond the number of computers Next will sell.''   Although the shroud is being lifted after three years ofdevelopment and an exceptionally successful media blackout, thecomputer won't immediately be available. Next will not say when themachine will be on the market.   At stake not only is the future of Jobs' second start-up company_ he co-founded Apple Computer 12 years ago with Steve Wozniak _but also Jobs' reputation as a genius entrepreneur. He shaped Appleinto the world's largest and most profitable company specializingin personal computers in the world before being resigning underpressure in 1985.   Next's machine is designed with the power of an engineeringworkstation, the kind that normally sells for upwards of $30,000 to$50,000. Jobs has promised to offer it for considerably less, butjust how much less is unknown.   Analysts early on speculated the machine would range from $3,000to $5,000, but estimates now range up to $7,000 to $10,000.   Jobs has said the Next computer was initially designed forcollege students and academic researchers, although analystsbelieve he now envisions a wider market.   It's been speculated his machine will be capable of competingwith such hot-selling technical workstations as those from SunMicrosystems Inc., Apollo Computer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.   Evidence of that are reports that IBM is paying $10 million forthe right to use the distinctive symbols and commands with whichthe user will interact with Next.   Industry executives last month told the New York Times that IBMplans to use the Jobs technology on computers that run the Unixoperating system, the standard for technical workstations.   IBM's use of Next's software technology, expected to beannounced Wednesday, could solve one of Jobs' biggest potentialproblems _ the difficulty in getting software developers to spendtime converting their programs for the Next alone.   Not everyone is convinced the Next will appeal to large audience.   ``The expectations are out of touch with reality,'' TripHawkins, president of San Mateo's Electronic Arts, told the SanJose Mercury News. ``It will be a miracle if it is what peoplesay.''   Some details of the computer have leaked out, the most reliableone being its unusual visual design with a black magnesium case and17-inch monochrome monitor.   Dazzling color Display Postscript software and other softwareare widely expected to give exceptionally vivid graphics _ possiblyoffering photo-like realism _ and numerous type fonts and sizes. Alaser printer also is expected to be offered, which would vastlyimprove industry reproduction quality standards.   According to numerous published reports, the software is sorevolutionary _ or at least Jobs' computer designers hope so _ thateven non-programmers should be able to create software on a Nextmachine.   That would allow professors, for example, to illustrate complexmath and science ideas with their own graphics.   In hardware, the Mercury News reports Next is expected to comewith an erasable optical disk drive, which could increase currentcomputer storage as much as 50 times and allow the storage ofdetailed images such as photographs.   Optical drives also can give computers the ability to playstereo digital music.   Jobs himself has indicated the computer will have a 32-bitMotorola 68030 chip, one of the industry's fastest; a connector toan industry standard network called Ethernet that will allow Nextto share files with other types of computers; and Mathematicasoftware, of special use for sophisticated math equations.   Other reports indicate the system also may feature a high-speedmodem allowing it to work with facsimile machines, optional digitalaudiotape storage, and the ability to display television-qualityvideo signals, not now available on any other personal computers.   Jobs founded Next in 1985 after leaving Apple in a powerstruggle with Apple's chief executive officer, John Sculley.   In early 1987, H. Ross Perot, the flamboyant founder of GeneralMotors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Inc. unit, invested $20million in Next and holds a 16 percent stake in the company. Jobshas invested $12 million of his own money and holds a 63 percentstake.   Seybold says the Next will prove to a skeptical industry thatthe past success of the 33-year-old Jobs, once dubbed ``theaccidental millionaire'' by an author who dismissed his allegedbusiness acumen as luck, was not a fluke.   ``The Next clearly shows that there is no question that Stevehas proved he really is extraordinary and ... is the kind of leaderwho gets people to achieve what they felt they couldn't achieve.''</TEXT></DOC>
