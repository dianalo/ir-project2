The carriersaid 1992's outlook depends entirely on the national economy.   The parent company of American Airlines said it had a lossof $124.9 million, or $1.83 a share, on revenue of $3.4billion in the recently ended quarter. The results include anafter-tax charge of $39.3 million, or 58 cents a share, forretirement of certain aircraft. The 1991 loss was narrowerthan the year-ago deficit of $215.1 million, or $3.45 ashare, on revenue of $3 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Even so, the quarterly loss propelled AMR's 1991 deficitto its largest ever. Chairman Robert L. Crandall called thefull-year results &quot;terrible,&quot; adding that &quot;the best you cansay about last year is that it's over.&quot;   For the full-year, AMR had a net loss of $239.9 million,or $3.54 a share, on revenue of $12.89 billion. In 1990,AMR's net loss was $39.6 million, or 64 cents a share, onrevenue of $11.72 billion.   Mr. Crandall continued to blame AMR's poor results on theweak economy. The Persian Gulf War of a year ago also keptpassengers off aircraft for the early part of the year. And,as he has before, Mr. Crandall railed against &quot;theshort-sighted and irrational pricing policies of some of ourcompetitors.&quot;   Indeed, financially-ailing Trans World Airlines recentlyintroduced cuts on its round-trip trans-Continental businessfares of several hundred dollars. UAL Corp.'s United Airlinesyesterday matched the cuts, a move that will put morepressure on other carriers, including American -- whichrecently introduced domestic business fares -- to do thesame.   Analysts on Wall Street had expected a heavier quarterlyloss for AMR, and the better-than-expected results sent thecompany's shares higher in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading yesterday, where they closed at $74.25, up $2.375.   &quot;I thought {the quarter} was better than expected, but itwas still a sizable loss and they have a long way to go,&quot;said Dan Hersh, a senior analyst with Kemper SecuritiesGroup. &quot;Let's face it, American did worse in '91 than in '90and '90 was pretty terrible.&quot;   One explanation for the narrower loss is the price of jetfuel, which has dropped markedly since mid-December. AMRcurrently is paying about 60 cents a gallon, vs. 82.5 cents ayear ago, and every penny of jet fuel AMR buys represents $30million a year in operating expenses, according to MichaelDurham, the company's chief financial officer. Mr. Durhamsaid the company expects fuel prices to remain soft in thenear term.   American also is trying hard to keep its yield, or theaverage amount one passenger pays to fly a mile, as high aspossible and was able to raise fourth-quarter yield 2.3%.Indeed, American has over the last year sacrificed marketshare for revenue. &quot;We're being more selective and sufferingon the load factor in exchange for trying to earn a premiumon the yield side,&quot; said Mr. Durham. During 1991, theairline's load factor, or percentage of seats filled, dippedslightly to 61.7% from 1990's 62.3%. The break-even loadfactor was 61.6%.   In the attempt to beef up revenue, American has jettisonedmany corporate discounts and recently introduced slightlyhigher business-class fares on its transcontinental flights.It has furloughed 1,250 employees and has cut back capitalspending by $8 billion over the next several years. Capitalspending for 1992, for example, will be $3.4 billion, vs.$5.5 billion in 1991.   Mr. Durham said yesterday that American hadn't yet decidedwhether to match an industry effort to raise seven-dayadvance purchase business and vacation discount fares.   Mr. Crandall said there were a few bright spots in lastyear's results, including new European service and strongLatin American routes where revenue is up more than 20%. Asfor the future, however, domestic first-quarter bookingscontinue to look soft. Beyond that, &quot;We hope . . . that thosepredicting recovery of the economy are correct,&quot; Mr. Crandallsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
