In theRequest, Lenox asks the Commission to reopen the proceeding and set asidethe cease and desist order entered by the Commission on July 24, 1970 (77F.T.C. 860) and modified by the Commission on July 12, 1982 (100 F.T.C.259). Lenox alleges that setting aside the order is warranted by changedconditions of fact and law and the public interest. Request at 2. The Requestwas placed on the public record for thirty days, pursuant to andSection;2.51(c) of the Commission's Rules, and two comments were received. On February24, 1989, Lenox submitted an affidavit responding to one of the publiccomments.The Commission has carefully considered Lenox's Request, the public commentsand Lenox's response to one comment and has concluded that Lenox has notmade a satisfactory showing that changed conditions of fact or law or thepublic interest require that the order be set aside in its entirety. Theorder prohibits Lenox from agreeing with its dealers with respect to resaleprices and in essence requires compliance with section 5(a)(1) of the FederalTrade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1). Lenox has not shown changed circumstancesthat eliminate the need for the order. Lenox also has not shown that itis unduly burdened by an order that merely requires it to abide by thelaw, and, therefore, setting aside the order is not warranted in the publicinterest.The Commission believes that the second part of paragraph 3 of the ordershould be set aside in the public interest. The second part of paragraph3 prohibits conduct that by itself may not be unlawful, and this provisionis no longer necessary to ensure Lenox's compliance with the law. In addition,paragraphs 9 (a) and (b), which require Lenox to reinstate dealers terminatedfor failing to observe Lenox's suggested resale prices or for transshippingLenox products, are inconsistent with subsequent modifications of the order.Consequently, the public interest is served by setting aside these provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">I</ITAG>The Commission's complaint in this matter, issued October 13, 1966, allegedthat Lenox agreed with its dealers to fix the resale prices for its products.In the original proceeding, the Commission found that ``agreements as toresale prices between respondent and its dealers do in fact exist,'' 73F.T.C. at 597, and held that Lenox had entered into unlawful price agreementswith its dealers in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade CommissionAct. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitaffirmed the Commission's decision and order, as modified. <T3>Lenox, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>FTC</T3>, 417 F.2d 128 (2d Cir. 1969).\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The court held that the Commission lacked authority toprohibit resale price maintenance agreements in states permitting suchagreements under ``fair trade laws,'' enacted pursuant to the McGuire Act.The Commission modified the order accordingly, incorporating a fair tradelaw proviso as paragraph 9 (later renumbered as paragraph 8) of the order.77 F.T.C. 860.The final order of the Commission contains provisions to remedy unlawfulprice maintenance by Lenox.\2\<NOTE/> Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order prohibit Lenox from requiringits dealers to agree to sell Lenox products at specified prices as a conditionof dealing. The first part of paragraph 3 prohibits Lenox from asking itsdealers ``to report any person or firm who does not observe the resaleprices suggested by respondent.'' The second part of Paragraph 3 prohibitsLenox from ``acting on reports so received'' by refusing to sell to noncompliantdealers. Paragraph 4 prohibits Lenox from ``[h]arassing, intimidating,coercing, threatening or otherwise exerting pressure on dealers'' to complywith established resale prices. Paragraph 7 prohibits Lenox from ``[u]tilizingany other cooperative means of accomplishing the maintenance of resaleprices.'' Paragraph 10 (later renumbered as paragraph 9) requires Lenoxto reinstate dealers that had been terminated for failing to maintain resaleprices or for transshipping.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Four of the remaining eight paragraphs of the originalorder have no further effect. Paragraphs 5 and 6 were time-limited andexpired in 1973. Former Paragraph 8, which prevented Lenox from banningdealer transshipments of its products, was set aside by the Commissionin 1982. Finally, Lenox complied with the order provision that requiredit to file a compliance report 60 days after service of the order.Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the order, both of which expired in 1973, prohibitedLenox from selling to dealers at a discount from retail prices and frompublishing suggested retail prices. Paragraph 8, which was vacated in 1982,prohibited Lenox from banning transshipment of its products by dealers.100 F.T.C. 259 (1982).\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ After Paragraph 8 was set aside, Paragraphs 9 and 10 wererenumbered Paragraphs 8 and 9. 100 F.T.C. at 259.<ITAG tagnum="84">II</ITAG>Section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 45 U.S.C. 45(b), providesthat the Commission shall reopen an order to consider whether it shouldbe modified if the respondent ``makes a satisfactory showing that changedconditions of law or fact'' so require. A satisfactory showing sufficientto require reopening is made when a request to reopen identifies significantchanges in circumstances and shows that the changes eliminate the needfor the order or make continued application of the order inequitable orharmful to competition. S. Rep. No. 96-500, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1979)(significant changes or changes causing unfair disadvantage); <T3>Louisiana-Pacific Corp., </T3>Docket No. C-2956, Letter to John C.Hart (June 5, 1986), at 4.Section 5(b) also provides that the Commission may modify an order when,although changed circumstances would not require reopening, the Commissiondetermines that the public interest so requires. Respondents are thereforeinvited in petitions to reopen to show how the public interest warrantsthe requested modification. 16 CFR 2.51. In such a case, the respondentmust demonstrate as a threshold matter some affirmative need to modifythe order. <T3>Damon Corp., </T3>Docket No. C-2916, Letter to Joel C. Hoffman, Esq.(March 24, 1983), at 2. For example, it may be in the public interest tomodify an order ``to relieve any impediment to effective competition thatmay result from the order.'' <T3>Damon Corp., </T3>Docket No. C-2916, 101 F.T.C. 686, 692 (1983). Oncesuch a showing of need is made, the Commission will balance the reasonsfavoring the modification requested against any reasons not to make themodification. Damon Letter at 2. The Commission also will consider whetherthe particular modification sought is appropriate to remedy the identifiedharm.The language of section 5(b) plainly anticipates that the burden is onthe petitioner to make ``a satisfactory showing'' of changed conditionsto obtain reopening of the order. The legislative history also makes clearthat the petitioner has the burden of showing, by means other than conclusorystatements, why an order should be modified. The Commission ``may properlydecline to reopen an order if a request is merely conclusory or otherwisefails to set forth specific facts demonstrating in detail the nature ofthe changed conditions and the reasons why these changed conditions requirethe requested modification of the order.'' S. Rep. No. 96-500, 96th Cong.,2d Sess. 9-10 (1979). If the Commission determines that the petitionerhas made the necessary showing, the Commission must reopen the order todetermine whether modification is required and, if so, the nature and extentof the modification. The Commission is not required to reopen the order,however, if the petitioner fails to meet its burden of making the satisfactoryshowing of changed conditions required by the statute. The petitioner'sburden is not a light one in view of the public interest in repose andthe finality of Commission orders. <T3>See Federated Department Stores, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Moitie, </T3>425 U.S. 394 (1981) (strong public interest considerationssupport repose and finality).<ITAG tagnum="84">III</ITAG>Lenox has shown neither changed conditions of law or fact nor public interestconsiderations that require setting aside the order in this matter in itsentirety. The order prohibits agreements to fix resale prices, conductthat is <T3>per se </T3>unlawful. The changed circumstances advanced by Lenox donot affect the <T3>per se </T3>illegality of agreements to maintain resale prices or bringthe order into conflict with existing law. In addition, Lenox ``has notshown that complying with an order that essentially requires adherenceto the law is causing it injury.'' <T3>William H. Rorer, Inc., </T3>Docket No. 8599, Order Modifying Ceaseand Desist Order, 104 F.T.C. 544, 545 (1984).\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In <T3>Rorer, </T3>the Commission declined to modify an order provision that``in essence'' required the respondent to comply with section 2(a) of theRobinson-Patman Act. <T3>See also Alhambra Motor Parts, </T3>Docket No. 6889, Letter to JohnC. Peirce, Esq. (January 19, 1988), at 6-7 (denying petition to set asideorder prohibiting violations of section 2(a) of Robinson-Patman Act).Lenox asserts that the law governing vertical restraints and the circumstancesin which an unlawful agreement can be inferred have changed significantlysince the order was entered in 1970. According to Lenox, its argument inthe original proceeding that its conduct was unilateral and therefore lawfulunder <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Colgate andamp; Co., </T3>250 U.S. 300 (1919), was rejected by the Commissionon the authority of decisions that had expanded the circumstances in whichan agreement between a manufacturer and its dealers could be inferred.Subsequent decisions, according to Lenox, ``have changed the legal criteriafor evaluating whether an agreement to maintain resale prices can be inferred''to such an extent that the evidence considered by the Commission in thismatter ``would not have given rise to [the original] proceeding much lessto a conclusion of violation, under today's standards.'' Request at 55.Lenox relies on <T3>Monsanto Co. </T3>v. <T3>Spray-Rite Service Corp., </T3>465 U.S. 752, 764 (1984), in which theSupreme Court said that an unlawful vertical price agreement must be provedby unambiguous evidence so as not to deter or penalize legitimate, unilateralconduct and legitimate communications between a manufacturer and its dealers.The evidence must ``tend to exclude the possibility that the manufacturerand the nonterminated distributor were acting independently.'' Lenox alsocites <T3>Business Electronics Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Sharp Electronics Corp., </T3><T2>X</T2> U.S. <T2>X</T2>, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988), in which the Court said that a verticalrestraint is not <T3>per se </T3>unlawful unless it includes an agreement on price or pricelevels.\5\<NOTE/> In both of these cases, the Supreme Court reiterated the<T3>Colgate </T3>doctrine that a manufacturer generally has a right todeal or to refuse to deal with whomever it likes, as long as it does soindependently.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In <T3>Monsanto, </T3>the Court held that a <T3>per se </T3>unlawful agreement could not be inferred from nothing morethan a dealer termination following competitors' complaints. In <T3>Sharp, </T3>the Court said that a vertical agreement to terminate aprice-cutting dealer is not <T3>per se </T3>unlawful unless there is also an agreement on price orprice levels. Absent an agreement on price, the rule of reason applies.The Commission's conclusion in the original proceeding that Lenox had engagedin unlawful resale price agreements was based on findings consistent withthese cases. The Commission expressly found that Lenox had required itsdealers to agree to resale prices. <T3>See </T3>73 F.T.C. at 594-95 andamp; 597. Lenox is incorrect when itsuggests that the standards applied by the Commission in the original proceedingare inconsistent with current law. Accordingly, Lenox has not shown thatchanged conditions of law require the Commission to reopen and set asidethe order. Here, as in <T3>Monsanto, </T3>it is necessary to distinguish between concerted andindependent action and between concerted action to set prices, which is<T3>per se </T3>unlawful, and concerted action on nonprice vertical restraints,which is judged under the rule of reason. The order in this matter proscribesconcerted action to set prices. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order prohibitLenox from entering into agreements concerning price with its dealers.These prohibitions are consistent with <T3>Monsanto </T3>and <T3>Sharp, </T3>in which the Court said the vertical agreements to fixprice are <T3>per se </T3>unlawful. The first part of paragraph 3 and paragraphs 4 and 7 of the order alsoare consistent with <T3>Monsanto </T3>and <T3>Sharp. </T3>The first part of paragraph 3, which bars Lenox from ``[r]equestingdealers, either directly or indirectly, to report any person or firm whodoes not observe the resale prices suggested by respondent,'' in essenceprohibits Lenox from inviting its dealers to participate in a resale pricemaintenance scheme. <T3>See Monsanto, </T3>465 U.S. at 764 n.9 and 765. This provision doesnot bar dealers from complaining to Lenox about price cutters. Instead,it bars Lenox from seeking the dealers' participation in policing and maintainingresale prices. Similarly, paragraph 4 of the order prohibits Lenox from coercing its dealers,by threats of termination or otherwise, to comply with Lenox's resale prices.Paragraph 7 prohibits Lenox from using ``any other cooperative means ofaccomplishing the maintenance of resale prices fixed by respondent.'' Nothingin <T3>Monsanto </T3>makes the conduct described in these provisions of theorder lawful. Threats to obtain dealer acquiescence in resale prices are``plainly relevant and persuasive to a meeting of the minds.'' <T3>Monsanto, </T3>465 U.S. at 765 andamp; n.10. Although cooperation andcoordination between Lenox and its dealers ``to assure that their productwill reach the consumer persuasively and efficiently'' is not unlawful,465 U.S. at 763-64, cooperation to maintain resale prices clearly is unlawful.The second part of paragraph 3 of the order prohibits Lenox from ``actingon reports so obtained by refusing or threatening to refuse sales to thedealers so reported.'' As written, this provision applies only when Lenoxsolicits and obtains the cooperation of its dealers in enforcing compliancewith resale prices and acts on the information so obtained. In addition,termination of a price cutting dealer is not lawful in all circumstances.For example, a manufacturer's threat to refuse to deal to obtain compliancewith resale prices can evidence an invitation to an unlawful agreement.<T3>Monsanto, </T3>465 U.S. at 765. Nevertheless, this provision will beset aside in the public interest. As the Court explained in <T3>Monsanto, </T3>dealers ``are an important source of information formanufacturers,'' dealer complaints about price cutters `` `arise in thenormal course of business and do not indicate illegal concerted action''' and a manufacturer's termination of a dealer following complaints fromother dealers would not, by itself, support an inference of concerted action.465 U.S. at 763-64. To the extent that this second part of paragraph 3may inhibit Lenox from legitimate unilateral conduct, it may cause competitiveinjury.\6\<NOTE/> Because any conduct that would be unlawful under this partof paragraph 3 would be prohibited by other provisions of the order, thereasons to set aside this provision outweigh any reasons to retain it.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ As discussed below, Lenox's claims of competitive disadvantageand injury are premised for the most part on its perceived inability unilaterallyto refuse to deal with firms that have small retail mark ups and do notprovide customer services. Request at 16-20 andamp; 52-54; <T3>see </T3>note 8 <T3>infra. </T3>Although paragraph 3 does not prohibit unilateral refusalsto deal, the modification eliminates any ambiguity in that regard. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV </ITAG>Lenox alleges that ``changes in market facts warrant vacation of the order.''Request at 36. Lenox has not shown that these alleged changed conditionsrequire setting aside the order. Agreements to fix resale prices remainunlawful, and Lenox has not shown that changed conditions of fact requiresetting aside order provisions that require compliance with the law. Lenox claims that intrabrand competition has increased significantly. Since1976, when the McGuire Act was repealed, Lenox states that it has authorized``multiple, quality dealers'' in all marketing areas and that price competitionamong Lenox dealers is and will continue to be ``the norm.'' Request at326-37. An increase in the number of authorized Lenox dealers and increasedcompetition among them are not changed conditions that eliminate the needfor the order or make continued application of it inequitable. Insteadof demonstrating a need to reopen and modify the order, these conditionsappear to be consistent with compliance with the order. Lenox also claims that interbrand competition has changed since 1970. Accordingto Lenox, domestic manufacturers of fine china have withdrawn from themarket, and imports have become dominant. Lenox claims that its foreignrivals are not restricted from preventing dealer practices that ``tarnish[][Lenox's] image and sap[] the profit of other quality dealers,'' so thatLenox is at a competitive disadvantage. Request at 38. Lenox does not claimthat Lenox is competitively disadvantaged by the fact that other U.S. firmsare no longer its competitors.\7\<NOTE/> Increased competition from foreign firms also is not a changedcondition that requires reopening and modification of the order. To theextent that the foreign firms do business in the United States, they, likedomestic firms, are required to comply with the law, and they are not freeto agree with their dealers to fix resale prices. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Lenox also does not claim that the withdrawal of otherdomestic firms, impliedly reducing interbrand competition, is in any wayattributable to the order. Lenox also alleges that marketing has changed, citing increased competitionfrom ``certain deep-discounting dealers, trading on the efforts of others''and ``destroying Lenox's distribution through prestige outlets.'' Requestat 38-39. According to Lenox, ``deep'' discounters often sell Lenox productsat prices 30% to 50% less than suggested resale prices. <T3>See </T3>Velsmid Affidavit at 2. These discounters usually (but notalways) maintain inferior displays and only minimal inventories of Lenoxchina and do not offer the full range of services that Lenox expects fromits dealers. <T3>Id. </T3>at 3. Many of these discounters accept telephone orders fromdistant customers, who select their china from the displays of full-servicedealers. As a result of deep discounting and free riding, Lenox claims, full-servicedealers discontinue or reduce their sales efforts for Lenox products, Requestat 39-40, and Lenox's image of quality, prestige and elegance has begunto erode. To substantiate this claim, Lenox has submitted affidavits fromits employees and from ``prestige'' retailers who say that such retailershave either cut back or discontinued their displays and sales of Lenoxproducts, because widespread deep discounting has made carrying them bothunprofitable and incompatible with the ``quality image'' of their stores.Lenox vigorously contends that its quality image is a major component ofthe value of fine china to consumers and that it must be allowed to terminatedeep discounters to protect that image before it is irreversibly damaged.Request at 40-45. In addition, Lenox asserts that interbrand competitionis impaired when prestige retailers curtail or discontinue sales of theLenox lines. Request at 37-38. Neither free riding nor the erosion of Lenox's quality image is a changedcondition that would warrant vacating the order. The order prohibits verticalprice fixing, which is unlawful. The order does not bar Lenox from imposinglawful nonprice vertical restraints to protect its product image.\8\<NOTE/> Lenox, however, has made a threshold showing that continuedapplication of the second part of paragraph 3 and of paragraphs 9 (a) and(b) of the order is causing injury to its competitive position. As discussedabove, the second part of paragraph 3 may inhibit Lenox from legitimateconduct. Paragraphs 9 (a) and (b) of the order require Lenox to reinstatedealers terminated for discounting or for transshipping Lenox products.\9\<NOTE/> Because unilateral termination of a dealer for discountingis not unlawful and because the order's prohibition of Lenox's ban on transshipmentswas set aside in 1982, requiring Lenox to reinstate dealers for these reasonswould be inconsistent with the order, as modified, and clearly would serveno further remedial purpose. To the extent that conduct described in theseprovisions might be in furtherance of an unlawful scheme to fix resaleprices, such conduct would be prohibited by the other provisions of theorder. Consequently, the need to set aside these provisions of the orderoutweighs any reasons to retain them. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ To the extent that Lenox's injury claim turns on freeriding by deep discounters on services provided by other dealers, Lenoxhas been able to ban resale of its products to unauthorized dealers sincethe 1982 modification of the order. Nothing in the order prevents Lenoxfrom requiring its dealers to provide customer services and from terminatingdealers for failing to do so. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Lenox asserts that these provisions are ``no longer applicable.''Request at 7-8, footnote. By their terms, however, these paragraphs arestill in effect. Accordingly, <T3>it is ordered that </T3>Lenox's Request to reopen and set aside theorder in this matter in its entirety be, and it hereby is, denied; and<T3>It is further ordered that </T3>this matter be reopened and that theCommission's order in Docket No. 8718, issued June 24, 1970, as modifiedby order dated July 12, 1982, be, and it hereby is, modified, as of thedate of service of this order, by setting aside paragraph 9 and by deletingfrom paragraph 3 ``or acting on reports so obtained by refusing or threateningto refuse sales to the dealers so reported.''<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
