More than 100,000 paramilitary troopers were deployed toreinforce local police to prevent violence that has claimed 39lives since the election for a new Parliament was announced a monthago.   Most of the victims were campaign workers who were stabbed,stoned, shot or hacked to death by supporters of rival parties.   Late Tuesday, the health minister of western Gujarat state wasfatally stabbed while getting into his car after addressing aCongress Party rally in Hatmatiana, a village 600 miles southwestof New Delhi. The assailant escaped.   The minister, Vallabhbhai Patel, died early Wednesday whileundergoing surgery, United News of India reported.   Gandhi, in one of his last campaign speeches, told amiddle-of-the-night rally at Kanakapura in southern Karnataka statethat only his Congress Party could give the nation the stability itneeds.   At stake are 524 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, thedecision-making lower house of Parliament.   Voters in only 15 of India's 24 states and five of its sevenfederally governed territorities cast their ballots Wednesday. Therest of the country goes to the polls Friday and Sunday. Resultsare not to be announced until late Sunday or Monday.   Elections in India are spread over several days because of thecountry's size, which compounds communications difficulties andspreads security forces thin.   Authorities in eastern Orissa state were using trained pigeonsto carry messages from remote villages to the state police.   More than 6,000 candidates are running for seats in the LokSabha. Voting was postponed indefinitely in Assam state becauseelectoral rolls were incomplete and balloting was delayed inseveral constituencies because of the deaths of candidates.   The National Front, a coalition of five opposition parties, madegovernment corruption the heart of its campaign. The coalitionleader, who is expected to be prime minister if it wins, isVishwanath Pratap Singh, formerly one of Gandhi's most trustedministers.   A National Front victory would loosen a dynastic family grip onIndian politics handed down from Rajiv's grandfather, JawaharlalNehru, through his mother, Indira. It could splinter the party thathas governed India for all but 29 months since independence fromBritain in 1947.   Nearly 500 million of the 880 million people are eligible tovote. Because the literacy rate is only 36 percent, a voter marks acandidate's symbol on the ballot.   At least 3.7 million government officials will supervise 600,000voting stations.   The outcome will be determined in the Hindi-speaking heartlandof northern India that stretches from Rajasthan in the west acrossHaryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to Bihar in the east.Nearly half the Lok Sabha is elected from what is called the HindiBelt.   Most Indians see the election as a referendum on Gandhi's recordsince he became prime minister after two Sikh bodyguardsassassinated his mother on Oct. 31, 1984.   Less than two months later, the Congress Party won anunprecedented 415 seats in the lower house, which gave it a mandateto change tradition-bound India and attack its ancient problems ofpoverty and illiteracy.   Gandhi liberalized the economy and opened the door to foreigninvestment, but failed to reform the notoriously inefficientbureaucracy or clean up politics and the Congress Party.   Ram Kumar, a 79-year-old bricklayer in Agra, said: ``TheCongress candidates are thieves, but I'll vote for them anywaybecause I'm afraid the opposition will be even more corrupt.''   Opposition leaders built their anti-corruption campaign around a$1.4 billion contract with the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors for400 army artillery pieces. They and several Indian newspapers sayBofors paid up to $50 million in kickbacks.   The prime minister denied any wrongdoing and no evidence hasbeen presented that links him or his family to the deal. CongressParty officials retaliated by accusing opposition leaders ofcorruption, nepotism and murder.   Bofors has become the rallying cry against the corruption thatplagues daily life in India, where a bribe usually is needed to geta telephone, a job or even into school.   Once, in 1977, the Congress Party was beaten. Factionalismdestroyed that government after 29 months, however, and Congresswon the 1980 elections.</TEXT></DOC>
