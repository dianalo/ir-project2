The General Accounting Office, in a study of the EndangeredSpecies Act 15 years after its passage, said Thursday anoverwhelming majority of the hundreds of fragile varieties ofwildlife protected by the law either show no signs of recovery orare sliding closer to extinction.   The congressional agency criticized the Fish and Wildlife Servicefor concentrating on high-profile species, such as the bald eagleand Aleutian Canada goose, over those that are more seriouslythreatened.   Fish and Wildlife Service officials told GAO investigators that``the desire for a positive public view of the program ... ismotivating its actions,'' said the report.   ``Instead of giving priority to the most endangered species andto those actions needed to prevent extinctions in the foreseeablefuture, as required by its guidelines, FWS instead is concentratingrecovery funds on species with high `public appeal' and thoseapproaching recovery,'' the study said.   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., who requested the study, said theagency's conclusions ``reinforce my own view that a more serious andprofessional approach to protecting endangered species is requiredif the goals of federal law are to be met.''   Studds is chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheriessubcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation.   Elizabeth Lipscomb, a spokeswoman for the Fish and WildlifeService, which has jurisdiction over the vast majority of thethreatened and endangered species listed, defended the agency'sprograms and practices.   ``We feel that it's important to devote resources to species thatthe public is concerned about, high visibility species like the baldeagle,'' she said. ``That doesn't necessarily mean we're notspending money on other species. We're spending money on a lot ofobscure species that people don't know about.''   The GAO study said of the 493 species protected under theEndangered Species Act of 1973, five have been declared recoveredwhile six have become extinct.   The review also concluded that while 75 of the species haveimproved, 165 have declined, 12 are extinct but not yet officialdeclared so and 179 have shown no change. The status of theremaining 51 of the species was not known.   The Fish and Wildlife Service had drafted by September 1987recovery plans for 56 percent of the species and had plans underwayfor another 18 percent, the GAO said. But many of the tasks outlinedin the plans to save the species have not been started.   In 16 recovery plans analyzed by GAO investigators, nearly halfof the tasks have not been undertaken even though the plans wereapproved on an average of more than four years ago.   The GAO report said 12 species are extinct but have yet to bedeclared so. They are: Mariana mallard, Mariana fruit bat, PalosVerdes blue butterfly, Scioto madtom, Bachman's warbler, giantanole, tuberculed-blossom mussel, turgid-blossom mussel,yellow-blossom mussel, dusky seaside sparrow, ivorybilled woodpeckerand eastern cougar.   Five species have been declared recovered, but the protections ofthe Endangered Species Act seem to account only for the recovery ofthe American alligator, GAO said. The recovery of the brown pelicanin the southeastern United States seems to be attributed to thenationwide ban on DDT, while the ``recovery'' of the Palau dove,Palau fantail and Palau owl simply stems from the discovery of morebirds.</TEXT></DOC>
