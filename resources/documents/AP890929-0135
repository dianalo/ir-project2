But the haul made by illegal ``drift-netters,'' modern-dayecological pirates, could dictate the future of a species close tothe hearts of Idaho anglers _ steelhead trout.   The relationship between the oceanic trawlers and the fishassociated with Idaho's effervescent mountain streams is as tangledas the nets unraveled nightly.   The environmental group Earthtrust from Hawaii documented about1,500 drift-net boats operating in the Pacific in 1988. Of those,30 to 60 boats were illegally taking fish, and even the legal boatsdestroy a variety of species caught in their nets, said WayneLewis, who directs drift-net enforcement efforts for the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle.   ``Those pirate ships cover up their names and markings,'' hesaid. ``They're crooks; they're going out and stealing fish.''   The technology that put Japan, South Korea and Taiwan at theforefront of many international markets is evident in the driftnets. They hang from floats and catch anything down to about 40feet. The nets are strong as wire and nearly transparent.   They are rolled out in the evening and stretch up to 60 milesper craft. In the morning, they are hauled in and workers pick offthe fish.   The body count also includes thousands of drowned porpoises, seabirds, seals and even dead whales, strangled by a plastic noose.Earthtrust estimates that fish and mammals face a ``curtain ofdeath'' about 30,000 miles long.   Even if the snares are cut and set adrift, they continue to pullin a catch as ``ghost nets,'' and steelhead, the migratory troutfrom Idaho's mountain streams, are directly in the drift nets' path.   The mid-Pacific features a warm flow of water that attractsfishing boats seeking red squid and other target species. Butsteelhead and salmon also are found in pockets of cold water, andcatching them is illegal, said Dexter Pitman, anadromous fishcoordinator for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. Anadromousrefers to fish that go from salt water to fresh water to spawn,such as salmon, shad and steelhead.   ``The warm-water species run smack dab into the cold-waterspecies,'' he said. ``It's hard to set regulations for the pocketsof cold water that are upwelling.''   Idaho's chinook salmon usually follow the coast to Alaska, whilesteelhead migrate to the ocean south of Alaska's Aleutian Islands.The illegal drift-net boats may stray 400 miles north of theinternational boundaries to catch salmon in that area.   The number of fall steelhead returning to Idaho is up somewhatfrom last year because cooler weather has caused them to swimupriver faster. But the population of fish now plying Idaho watersis far smaller than in the past, officials say.   The illegal catches of migratory U.S. and Canadian fish came tolight in 1986-1987 during a crackdown by Lewis' agency on ``fishlaundering'' on the West Coast.   Tons of salmon were being transferred from Taiwan to Seattle orSan Francisco, then given fraudulent U.S. documentation so theycould be legally shipped to Japan, which has outlawed Taiwaneseimports of high-seas salmon.   In one breakthrough, NOAA covertly arranged to buy 500 metrictons of salmon from a Taiwanese merchant, Lewis said. As 140 tonswere being transferred from two Taiwanese fishing boats to a hiredrefrigerator ship south of the Aleutians, Coast Guard shipsappeared on the horizon.   One boat was chased all the way to Taiwan. Of the 140 metrictons of fish found, 1.4 tons were steelhead, Lewis said. Themerchant was arrested at a bank when he tried to deposit his take.   Pitman said wrangling between Northwest states and Canadianprovinces over the rights to migratory fish has dissolved in theface of a greater threat from the drift nets.   Representatives of the two nations met recently in BritishColumbia and agreed to study the problem. A specific analysis ofthe drift-netters' effect on salmon and steelhead will be availableby late winter, Pitman said.   ``We know Idaho steelhead are involved in it,'' he said. ``Butwe don't know how much.''   The United States has concluded three agreements with thePacific Rim nations to allow observers on the drift-net boats,Lewis said. Some already are in place on Japanese craft.   But arranging observers is difficult. The United States mustgain the permission of the captain or country of origin, and thepirate ships don't want to be spotted, let alone carry an observer,Lewis said.   The technology that produced the drift nets has outstripped themonitoring efforts to stop them, Pitman said. Conservationists areworried that robbing the seas of some species could cause awholesale collapse of the entire biological chain.   Said Pitman: ``The ocean, like everything else, has its limits.''</TEXT></DOC>
