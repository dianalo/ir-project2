To reach the desired target thickness of 10/sup14/ polarized atoms/cm{sup 2} requires the use of a storage cell. Successfultests of storage cells that permit 400 wall collisions without significantdepolarization are reported. The proposed spin filter experiment to partiallypolarize the circulating p-bar beam by spin-selective attenuation ofp-bar in the polarized hydrogen target is reviewed and examples of specificplanned experiments are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
