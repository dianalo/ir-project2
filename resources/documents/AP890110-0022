The proposal would affect the 5.3 million health care workers at620,000 worksites who have frequent contact with potentiallyinfectious materials, the Labor Department said.   ``Any standard should meet the critical needs by giving healthcare workers the protection they want and have every right toexpect,'' Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said Monday in announcingthe proposal. ``It can literally be a lifesaver.''   A department spokesman said a draft of the proposed regulationswould be published in the Federal Register in about two weeks.Public comment will be accepted before the department decides onfinal language.   Current worker-safety laws in general require employers toprovide safety equipment and worker education when there arepotential hazards, but there are no specific regulations concerningblood-borne diseases.   The Occupational Health and Safety Administration, an agencywithin the Labor Department, promised last year to draft theregulations as part of a program to address concerns raised byhealth care workers.   McLaughlin said the proposed regulation would require the use ofsafety equipment, worker training in handling infected blood andbody fluids and other specific precautions tailored to the specificworksite.   About 12,000 health care workers are infected with Hepatitis-Beach year, resulting in approximately 200 deaths annually, accordingto government figures.   The department had no specific figures on the number of healthcare workers who contract AIDS because of their jobs.   ``Where diseases like AIDS and Hepatitis-B are concerned, ourhealth care professionals are truly on the front line,'' McLaughlinsaid. ``They're working to contain the problem. We must ensure thatthey are not victims of it.''</TEXT></DOC>
