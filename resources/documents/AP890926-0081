(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Truckloads of ice, plastic sheeting,bottled water other necessities are beginning to arrive from theoutside world as a few services return to communities shattered byHurricane Hugo.   Charleston Harbor reopened to limited ship traffic today insunny but cool weather, and residents were advised Monday that thecity's water supply is safe to drink without boiling.   The storm, which rammed the coast Thursday night with winds of135 mph and torrential rain, left at least $3 billion in damage,state officials said.   Hugo killed 33 people as it rampaged through the Carribean; 28deaths on the U.S. mainland are blamed on the hurricane and itsremnants.   Two inches of rain Monday fell on Charleston, and there was an80 percent chance of showers today, the National Weather Servicesaid.   ``It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going tomake everything a little more miserable,'' said Kay Robinson, ofthe weather service.   Offers of outside help have begun to arrive.   A Maryland business sent two truckloads of ice Monday to helpresidents who have no electricity to refrigerate food. The ice fromthe Berlin Ice Co. was delivered in tractor-trailers by the Perduechicken company.   The Mississippi Department of Agriculture will set up a foodstand Thursday, offering a ton of fried catfish, hush puppies andFrench fries.   Truckloads of plastic sheeting, blankets, trash bags, diapers,tools, bottled water and other necessities were sent by Wal-Martstores, said spokeswoman Brenda Lockhart at the company'sBentonville, Ark., headquarters.   ``We still have our sleeves rolled up,'' she said Monday.``We'll find out what needs to be done and react accordingly.''   Utility companies across the South offered to send crews to helprestore service to the thousands of homes and businesses blacked bythe storm.   More than 150 workers from the Florida Power andamp; Light Co. were onthe job or on the way, said spokesman Dale Thomas.   Power was restored Monday to more than 200,000 people in theCarolinas, but at least 546,000 remained without service, accordingto utility company officials. It could be a month before fullservice is restored.   Power has been restored to about 5 percent of Charlestoncustomers, including hospitals.   Commerce is picking up on Broad Street in the heart of theHistoric District, where some stores and restaurants used emergencygenerators Monday to power cooking and lighting.   A few banks reopened, and some automatic-teller machines havesprung to life _ a godsend in a city where cash has become scarce.   At the Citizens and Southern National Bank Monday, customerswith checks to cash lined up under four light bulbs strung from awire hooked to a generator. Tellers phoned transactions to banks inother parts of the state to record the information on computers,said John Jordan, senior vice president.   Down the street at Charleston City Hall, volunteers manned abank of phones set up as part of a nationwide relief effort.   The city needs everything from canned goods and bread tobuilding supplies, generators and roofing nails, said Mayor JosephP. Riley.   Gov. Carroll Campbell announced the state would hire some of theestimated 224,000 workers displaced by the storm to help withcleanup efforts.   President Bush expanded his earlier disaster declaration toinclude four North Carolina counties. He already declared sevenSouth Carolina counties as disaster areas. The declaration freesfederal assistance and eases the way to getting loans for repairs.   Seventeen Navy ships and five freighters were at anchor off theCharleston Harbor waiting to return today, said Anne Moise,spokeswoman for the State Ports Authority.   The port was closed Friday after tidal surge destroyed ordisplaced navigational buoys and caused shoaling within thechannel. The Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers were checkingfor dangerous debris, and will completely reopen the harbor once itis found safe and all the buoys are replaced, she said.   The port, the second largest on the East and Gulf coasts,sustained millions of dollars in damage and lost business as shipswere diverted to other ports, officials said.   The Corps also began work on a temporary pontoon bridge to linkdevastated Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island to the mainland onceagain, but the coastal resort of Garden City remained closed andguarded by troops against looters. The bridge to the Isle of Palmsand Sullivan's Island was wiped out by the storm.   Residents on Monday were ferried to the Isle of Palms for brieflooks at their property, and were allowed to collect one suitcaseeach of belongings.   ``On a normal day, this was like being in heaven,'' residentPaul Traywick said after getting his first post-storm look at theisland. ``It's not like that any more,'' Traywick said. ``Not for along time.''</TEXT></DOC>
