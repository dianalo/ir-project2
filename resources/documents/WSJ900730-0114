Down and down it plummets into the Western Deep gold mine,slicing through the dark at 30 miles per hour. Ears pop. Airrushes by. After a mile and a half, the cage shimmies to astop. The door clangs open and the miners step out into ahoneycomb of damp and narrow tunnels. Surely, if there is oneplace where Anglo American Corp., South Africa's miningcolossus and corporate anti-apartheid crusader, can takerefuge from the hurricane of change buffeting its empireabove, this is it.</LP><TEXT>   But even here, at the bottom of one of the deepest holesin the world, there is no escape. &quot;Viva ANC,&quot; proclaims asplash of red grafitti spray-painted on a jagged rock wall bya miner hailing the African National Congress, the recentlyunbanned black liberation movement. Elsewhere, someone haspainted &quot;AWB,&quot; the initials of the AfrikanerWeerstandsbeweging, a white supremacist group.   &quot;Politics has no place down here,&quot; growls Humphrey Hobday,the mine manager at Western Deep's south shaft. His workthese days is consumed by efforts to keep the politicalemotions of his miners from clashing underground. He switcheson the lamp attached to his hard hat and crawls down a tunnelto where a team of miners -- black and white, ANC and AWB --are blasting away at a vein of gold. The shift boss reportsthey are approaching a monthly production record. Mr. Hobdaybeams; business, for now, prevails.   &quot;The survival of the industry should be more importantthan any political beliefs,&quot; he says. &quot;We can't afford to besaving the country down here.&quot;   Here is an irony richer than any chunk of gold: AngloAmerican, which has sought to save South Africa fromapartheid, is now hunkering down to save itself. For manyyears, Anglo and other South African corporations went beyondthe usual realm of business, challenging the government toscrap racial segregation and white minority rule in favor ofpower sharing with the black majority. Now that thegovernment has moved boldly in this direction by unbanningthe ANC, the Communist Party and other groups and by engagingthem in negotiations, the company that so ardently promotedchange is scrambling to protect itself from the fallout.   At its mines and factories, Anglo is wrestling to containthe heightened political tensions of a polarized work force;already, several clashes between white and black miners havedisrupted gold production in the Orange Free State. And inthe board room, Anglo is circling the wagons against threatsfrom the newly legal political organizations to nationalizeor break up the company as a means of dismantling the greaterwhite economic monopoly. In the new politics of correctingthe inequities of apartheid, Anglo is the fattened calf.   &quot;Anglo reflects the concentration of economic power withina minority of a white minority,&quot; says Tito Mboweni, an ANCeconomist. &quot;Clearly, a future government will have to dealwith this.&quot;   Anglo towers over the South African economy from the topof a pyramid of interlocking corporate holdings. With anasset base exceeding $14 billion, Anglo controls at leastone-third of the total capitalization of the JohannesburgStock Exchange. In addition to being the world's largest goldproducer, Anglo is a partner in the diamond cartel with itscousin, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which showed itsreach last week by signing a $5 billion deal to market theSoviet Union's diamonds. Anglo is also involved in breweriesand banks, cars and chemicals, steel and sugar, wine andwatermelon.   At the pyramid's pinnacle is an all-white, all-maleexecutive committee -- they call themselves a &quot;band ofbrothers&quot; -- that operates from a squat three-story buildingin downtown Johannesburg known simply as 44 Main Street.   Anglo always reckoned that it would have the most to gainfrom an economy freed from segregation: An end to apartheidwould end South Africa's isolation and allow Anglo to giverein to its ambitions to expand abroad. But, in the periloustransition to a post-apartheid economy, Anglo may also havethe most to lose.   Anglo has been a symbol of dominance ever since ErnestOppenheimer opened for business in 1917. While thepro-government Afrikaans press caricatured Mr. Oppenheimer asthe cigar-chomping &quot;Hoggenheimer&quot; out to subvertAfrikanerdom, the left-wing press portrayed Anglo as thebowler-hatted robber barons of apartheid, prospering fromcheap black labor. In the 1960s, the ruling Afrikaners, waryof Anglo's increasing financial power, even discussednationalizing the gold mines. Anglo nipped that threat byspinning off one of its mining holdings to Afrikaner control.   But the clamor today is different. The ANC and othersaren't talking about a few crumbs but about an economicrestructuring to match the political overhaul currently inprogress. While Anglo, along with most of the businesscommunity, agrees with the need to redistribute wealth, it ishaving trouble coming up with ways to let go. Having spun anelaborate web of possession and control, the spider now seemsto be caught in its own design.   &quot;We can't make ourselves smaller,&quot; says Julian OgilvieThompson, Anglo's chairman. Vulnerability hangs with thecigar smoke in his regally appointed office. Exasperationtaints his Oxford accent. &quot;I mean, that isn't going to makesense. Any company has got to grow to stay alive.&quot;   He talks about the virtues of capitalism and its triumphover socialism. He notes the misery in the rest of Africa,aggravated by Marxism and mismanagement. He cites Anglo'santi-apartheid credentials: the main donor to white, liberalopposition politics, the first company to recognize blackunions, the huge spending -- now more than $20 million a year-- on black education, training and housing.   But in a country where many blacks equate capitalism withapartheid -- and both with Anglo American -- this isn'tenough. What more, Mr. Thompson wonders, can a company dowithout sacrificing its business? &quot;I'm afraid we have noquick fix,&quot; he says. He beseeches a visitor: &quot;Have you someideas?&quot;   Such groping is rare at 44 Main. When he founded Anglo(partly with capital from Newmont Mining and the J.P. Morganbank in the U.S., hence the &quot;American&quot; in Anglo American),Ernest Oppenheimer created not just a mining company but amining finance house, with all the capital and technicalskills he needed assembled under one roof. Soon, he wasacquiring diamond concessions to go with the gold andparlaying these holdings into a world-wide cartel of diamondproducers that would regulate the gem's marketing and,ultimately, its price.   Since mining needed a certain amount of civil engineeringand building, Mr. Oppenheimer founded what has become one ofthe country's major construction groups; likewise, mining'sneed for explosives prompted him to create a chemicalscompany, today the country's largest. As mining brought theindustrial revolution to South Africa, Anglo pushed intosteel and paper. And what it didn't start, it bought --interests in insurance, banking, property, publishing,retailing and auto manufacturing. With little competition,Anglo just kept growing as the country itself grew into themost developed in Africa.   &quot;Our policy,&quot; says former Anglo Chairman Gavin Relly, &quot;isbased on making things happen and not waiting for them tohappen to us.&quot;   This philosophy -- possession begets control, controlbegets stability -- is reflected in Anglo's vast holdings,which for the fiscal year ended March 31 produced net incomeof about $720 million; the retained earnings of itsassociated companies raises that profit to above $1.2billion. At the core is a dizzying circle of cross-holdingsamong Anglo, De Beers and Anglo American Investment Trust(Anamint), which protects the trio from hostile takeover:Anglo owns 7% of De Beers, which owns 38% of Anglo; Angloowns 52% of Anamint, which owns 26% of De Beers, which owns10% of Anamint. Behind this web lies the influence of81-year-old Harry Oppenheimer, Ernest's son, who controls thefamily's 8% stake in Anglo.   From this circle of control spins the financing to sustainchains that reach far into the country's economy. Forexample: Anglo holds 40% in mining house JohannesburgConsolidated Investments Ltd. (JCI), which holds 37% ofpublisher Argus Group Ltd., which holds 38% of anotherpublisher, Times Media Ltd.; for good measure, Anglo directlyholds 15% of Argus, and JCI has a direct 27% stake in TimesMedia. In the end, Anglo effectively controls the country'stwo main English-language publishing houses and most of theEnglish-language newspapers.   Anglo executives have been exploring ways to untangle thisweb, but mining analysts say inertia has set in. In 1987,Anglo initiated an employee share ownership plan, but so farit involves less than 1% of issued shares. Partnerships withblack entrepreneurs on supply contracts are in their infancy;management buy-outs or spinning off companies to employeesapparently aren't being considered.   &quot;The people at the top just aren't thinking radicallyenough,&quot; says Duncan Innes, a professor of industrialsociology at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand.&quot;And in South Africa today, you have to think radically.&quot;   Instead, Anglo has turned conservative. &quot;I don't thinkthis is the time to come out with great undertakings one wayor the other,&quot; says Mr. Relly, who is still an Anglodirector. Sitting beside Nelson Mandela at a press conferencefollowing a recent meeting between the ANC and businessleaders, Mr. Relly testily said he wouldn't join in any&quot;fatuous&quot; discussions about the breakup of Anglo.   Not fatuous to everyone. Having studied economics inLesotho and England during his 10 years in exile, the ANC'sMr. Mboweni now works behind a second-hand desk surrounded bypeeling wallpaper in a downtown Johannesburg office. Bigness,he argues, concentrates investment decisions in too few hands-- almost all of them white -- and stifles competition aswell as black economic empowerment.   &quot;Just look at this. It's like a giant octopus,&quot; he says,waving a chart of Anglo's corporate holdings. He picks up apen, and, like a surgeon making an incision, draws a big Xover the line linking Anglo to First National Bank of SouthAfrica and another X over the line to Southern LifeAssociation, a big insurer. Slicing off these operations, hesays, should take care of Anglo's reach over the financeindustry.   The ANC calls this &quot;clipping the wings&quot; of theconglomerates. At the moment, says Mr. Mboweni, the ANCfavors antitrust legislation, rather than nationalization, todo the clipping. &quot;The conglomerates reflect the nature of oursociety,&quot; he says. &quot;What good is breaking up the whites'political monopoly if the economic monopoly remains?&quot;   Mr. Relly cringes at such logic; he has tried hard tochange it. In 1985, he led a small delegation of businessmento the ANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, for thefirst-ever talks between the two groups. Since then, Angloofficials have met regularly with ANC members around theworld. One even visited Mr. Mandela in prison. And when Mr.Mandela was released in February after 27 years in jail, Mr.Relly was the first prominent white businessman to stop byhis home.   Still, the image of Anglo as a robber baron persists inthe minds of many ANC officials and black South Africans.&quot;One of the things one has come to understand is theenormously long lead time which is necessary to change thesefundamental attitudes,&quot; Mr. Relly says. &quot;All you can say isthat we're trying.&quot;   So, the once-secretive company is pinning its salvation oncommunication. Rather than restructuring itself, Anglo hopesto restructure its corporate image.   In the mines, Anglo is trying to repair its image with theNational Union of Mineworkers, a staunch ANC ally and Anglo'schief adversary during a miners' strike in 1987. Mr. Hobday,the mine manager at Western Deeps, has initiated a series ofsensitivity seminars, a first in the macho mining industry.Every day, a different group of 50 black miners gets a chanceto speak their minds with management. Asked to list fiveareas of discrimination in the mines, the miners usually comeup with 10 or more. Topping the list one day is: &quot;When we getinto the cages (elevators) with whites we are called`kaffirs.'&quot; Kaffir is the equivalent of &quot;nigger.&quot;   Though the program is only a few weeks old, miner MtataleMamokheli notices a little improvement underground. &quot;Thesupervisors are being more accommodating,&quot; he says, a lightshining from his hard-hat. &quot;Before, we weren't looked upon asbeing people.&quot;   Back at 44 Main, there is talk of shaping a &quot;nationalattitude&quot; where big isn't necessarily seen as bad. &quot;We'llhave to go on pressing ahead, persuading people that we'refair and constructive to employees,&quot; says Mr. Thompson.   Communication is key, he says. Later, in an office downthe hall, the telephone rings. It is the ANC's Mr. Mboweni.He has read in the newspapers that Anglo's annual report isout. Can he have a copy?   Certainly, he is told, it will be on his desk soon.
