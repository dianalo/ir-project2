House and Senate negotiators are considering a Senate-passed taxbill which includes the anti-Iraq provision. The bill is one of thefinal items on the congressional agenda before the legislatorsadjourn for the year.   The sanctions package was approved by the Senate, 87-0, as anamendment Tuesday evening, shortly before the entire bill waspassed, 87-1.   It was third time in two months the Senate has voted on theissue, following reports that the Iraqi army used chemical arms inlate August to put down Kurdish rebels.   ``The world cannot stand by in the face of repeated use ofpoison gas by Iraq,'' said Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.   The measure, less sweeping than the sanctions package adopted bythe Senate a month ago, is similar to a plan already approved bythe House.   The bill would ban the export to Iraq of U.S. munitions and somehigh technology items, and require America to oppose loans to Iraqby international financial institutions such as the World Bank.   In addition, President Reagan would have to levy more sanctionsby Dec. 31 unless Iraq provides verifiable assurances that it won'tagainst use chemical weapons. Those potential sanctions includedenial of export-import credits and downgrading diplomaticrelations.   But the bill wouldn't restrict grain exports or halt Iraqiattempts to get monetary credits to buy U.S. agricultural products.   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., reflecting the worries of farm statelegislators, said, ``The concern is that this not lead to anembargo on agricultural exports to Iraq.''   But Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., complained that the measure unfairlypenalized U.S. manufacturers.   ``They're probably laughing at us in Iraq right now,'' Heinzsaid, declaring that the bill would not cut off the export to Iraqof the equipment and chemicals needed to produce such chemicalweapons as mustard gas and nerve gas.</TEXT></DOC>
