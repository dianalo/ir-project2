 Just install a network server for filesharing or a large multiuser database--or store dozens of 24-bit graphics,audio, and animation files on your stand-alone Mac -- and you'll soon hungerfor a bigger, faster hard-disk drive.andM;But there are special factors to consider when you buy a drive ten times thesize of anything you've bought before.andP;  And with so many drives to choosefrom, deciding what to purchase can be a bit intimidating.andP;  Is it wiser toget just the storage space you need or to overbuy so you'll have room in thefuture?andP;  What's most important: price, performance, or reliability?andP;  Andshould you trust the tweaks that some manufacturers have made to theirbig-drive mechanisms to increase speed in high-use settings (see the &quot;How ItWorks Faster&quot; sidebar)?andM;To help you make the right selection amid a wide field of choices, MacUserLabs gathered 22 external hard-disk drives in the 300-megabyte range andsubjected them to performance tests for speed and data throughput.andP;  We alsosurveyed dealers across the country to compile a unique street-price index tohelp strengthen your bargaining position.andP;  In addition, we investigated theservice options offered by each vendor.andP;  Finally, we added it all up topinpoint the best deals.andM;Learning the MechanicsandM;Although we found 22 vendors that offer drives in the 300-megabyte range, alltheir drive mechanisms come from only seven OEMs.andP;  The high-capacity-drivemarket is dominated by Seagate Technology, whose various mechanisms are usedin 13 of the drives we reviewed.andP;  The next-most-ubiquitous OEM is Micropolis,which makes the mechanism used in 4 drives.andP;  Five other manufacturers wererepresented, each with a single entrant.andP;  Be aware that some vendors vary theOEM mechanisms based on customer request, market price, or availability.andP;  Ifyou're interested in a drive because it contains a particular mechanism, besure to specify the one you want.andP;  If a vendor isn't willing to commit toproviding it, look elsewhere.andM;Although this report focuses on drives of about 300 megabytes, the actualcapacities of the 22 drives range from 291 to 420 megabytes.andP;  (To see howthis year's crop of drives compares to the past, see &quot;Big Hard Disks,&quot; June'88, page 122.)andP;  As always, whenever you shop for drives, compare formattedcapacities only.andP;  For the most part, advertised drive capacities closelyapproximate formatted capacities.andP;  Some of the drive names can be misleading,however -- for example, the MAcProducts Magic 380 actually yields only 325megabytes when formatted.andM;Conventional wisdom holds that you can never have too much disk-storagecapacity, but you may regret buying too much too soon.andP;  The hard-drive marketis extremely competitive, and storage technology continues to advance at adizzying rate.andP;  As a result, each year sees the introduction ofhigher-capacity disk drives at greatly reduced prices (see Figure 1).andP;  Sowhen you buy a large drive, estimate how much storage capacity you are likelyto need in the next year or two and try to pick a drive that fills only theseshort-range needs.andP;  By the time you outgrow this purchase, hard-drive priceswill most likely have dropped because of advances in technology and theincreasing number of large drives available.andP;  You can then expect to buy muchmore for less.andM;Cost ConsciousnessandM;Just because big hard drives have become more affordable doesn't mean thatyou can afford to take this purchasing decision lightly.andP;  The list prices ofthese drives run from a low of $1,395 for the 325-megabyte MacProducts Magic380 to $4.395 for the 306-megabyte Optima MiniPak 310 and the 320-megabytePLI PL 320F Turbo.andM;Because lists prices don't tell the whole storey (drives sold through dealersare often discounted far below their suggested retail price), MacUsercontacted a representative sampling of dealers throughout the United Statesto determine the average -- not necessarily the lowest -- street prices ofthe drives we reviewed.andP;  We found that manufacturers that sell directly tocustomers usually have the best prices, but even street prices for drivessold through dealers average 25 percent below the manufacturer's suggestedretail price.andM;Additionally, mail-order houses often offer bundling schemes that can saveyou money on the drive as well as on the software that comes with it.andO;Mac-Tel in Austin, Texas, for example, bundles a very versatile softwarepackage with several Seagate-based drives in the 300-megabyte range.andP;  You canget a 330-megabyte Wren Runner mechanism (more prosaically known as theSeagate ST4385NM) with backup, encryption, disk-mirroring software,andsoftware that supports A/UX and ProDOS, all for $1,999.andP;  But remember:Mail-order houses usually can't give you the same level of after-sale servicethat a dealer can.andM;To see which drives provide the most bytes for the buck, divide formattedcapacity by street price (see Figure 2).andP;  High-capacity hard drives tend tobe more cost-effective than smaller models, with the best bargains (theMacProducts Magic 380, HDI POWERDrive 320, and La Cie ZFP400) at slightlymore than $4 per megabyte.andP;  In contrast, premium-priced drives (the PLI PL320F Turbo, Procom MD 320, and Optima MiniPak 310) cost more than $10 permegabyte.andM;SCSI StandardsandM;All the external hard-disk drives reviewed this months are SCI devices thatattach to the DB-25 connector on the back of all Macs since the Plus.andP;  TheSCSI standard lets you connect up to seven devices -- hard drives, scanners,printers -- in a daisy chain, with each device plugged into the back of thenext.andP;  Theoretically, all you need to do is make sure that youassign eachdevice a unique SCSI ID number and that the devices on both ends of the chainare terminated.andP;  It sounds easy, but it's not (see &quot;A Beginner's Guide toDaisy Chains,&quot; August '90, page 243).andM;Drives usually arrive on your desk with a SCSI ID number already assigned,but sometimes that number is already taken by some other SCSI device attachedto your Mac.andP;  Don't worry.andP;  Resolving SCSI ID conflicts is simple -- usually.andO;Vendors provide several ways to set SCSI ID numbers.andP;  The choices includemechanical settings such as DIP or rotary switches, push buttons, and thumbwheels or special software &quot;switches&quot; that after nonvolatile memory in thedrive's controlling electronics.andM;DIP switches (used only on the Mirror MP290 among the drives we tested) are anuisance, because you must interpret their binary settingsandgt; the manufacturerusually provides a DIP-switch map, though.andP;  The software-based solutionsoffered bugh.andP;  The software-based Cranel, MacProducts, and SuperMac are alittle better, but be careful not to lose the utility disk.andP;  In general,external ID switches -- push buttons, thumb wheels, and rotary switches --are best, because you can see the current ID setting at a glance.andM;More problematic and potentially more damaging to your data is the part ofthe SCSI standard that requires that devices at either end of the daisy chainbe terminated.andP;  This requirements ensures that all signal voltages fallreliably within the right range and prevents signal reflections fromappearing on the SCSI lines.andP;  It sounds very precise, but in practice SCSItermination is often a black art about which even the experts stronglydisagree on the best approach.andP;  Apple itself doesn't terminate its computers(as called for in the SCSI specifications), and the Mac IIfx differs fromprevious Macs in that it requires so-called black terminators with built-infilter capacitors that &quot;absorb&quot; short pulses that the SCSI controller chipmight otherwise interpret as control signals.andM;Most drive mechanisms come from the OEM with removable terminating resistorsalready installed in the drive.andP;  In 12 of the drives we evaluated, theseinternal terminators were left in place, forcing you to open the case to getat them (if required by your hardware configuration).andM;A better approach is for the vendor to remove the drive's resistors andprovide an external terminator plug instead.andP;  If you need termination, youslide the supplied plug into the last connection in the SCSI chain.andP;  Eventhough it's one more thing to lose or have fall off, the termination plug issimple and effective, and you can easily tell whether it's installed or not.andO;Deltaic, FWB, GCC, Optima, RACET, Relax, and Storage Dimensions have chosenthis external-termination scheme for their drives.andP;  iDS Systems, PLI, andPRocom take an even better approach by providing externally switchablebuilt-in SCSI termination that can be turned on or off.andM;Software SetupandM;Most hard drives come preformatted, by the vendor, ready to use.andP;  The way thedisk has been formatted, however, may not be best for the kind of Mac youhave.andP;  If, for example, you use an accelerator, you'd do best to choose ahigher-performance format, so you may need to reformat the drive.andP;  Thevendors should provide you with utilities to do this.andM;Some formatting software can detect the type of Mac you're using andautomatically format the drive for use with the Mac.andP;  Others give you thisoption manually.andP;  In either case, choosing an alternative format geared tothe Mac you have can sometimes affect the drive's performance profoundly.andP;  Tounderstand why this is so, you need to know what it means to format a drive,install its driver, and change its interleave (see also &quot;The File System,&quot;October '90, page 279).andM;Drives come from the factory with concentric circles, or tracks, and a wayfor locating any particular track (a servo strategy) already established.andO;During a low-level format of a drive, its tracks are divided into segments,or sectors, and bad areas or sectors are locked out.andP;  The drive is theninitializedandgt; that is, a partition map of the drive is laid down (you can havetwo or more partitions), a driver is installed, and the drive is then readyto receive data.andP;  When data is subsequently written to the drive, it'swritten sector by sector by the same head that will read it later.andP;  When datais requested from the Mac, the drive sends it back one sector at a time,waiting for the go-ahead from the Mac (through the SCSI interface) beforesending the next sector.andM;It's here that questions of efficiency arise.andP;  If the requested data is incontiguous sectors and the SCSI interface gives the go-ahead quickly enough,the drive will be able to efficiently transfer all the necessary data in onepass of the track.andP;  If, however, the SCSI interface is too slow for the drive-- as might be the case with a Mac Plus or SE -- the drive will be able totransfer only one sector of data per rotation of the disk and will have towait at least another full rotation before the next proper sector of data iscorrectly positioned under the read/write head.andP;  Each mechanical rotationrequires about 1/60 second -- a lifetime in computer terms.andM;To avoid this time-wasting spinning, hard-disk vendors use a formatting trickcalled sector interleave.andP;  Instead of logically consecutive sectors beingplaced one after another on the hard disk's magnetic platter duringformatting, they're laid out in an alternating pattern, occupying everysecond or third sector.andP;  While the drive waits for the Mac to catch up, onlythe intervening sectors (rather than the whole track) spin past before itreads again.andP;  As a general rule, the best interleave for most disks on anunaccelerated Mac Plus is 3:1, meaning that three sectors must spin by foreach sector that is read.andP;  With a Mac SE, the best interleave is 2:1, andMacs in the II line perform best with a 1:1 ratio.andM;Of all the drives we tested, only those from Cranel, Deltaic, RACET, andSuperMac do not have formatters to let you set the interleave.andP;  Keep in mind,however, that many third-party hard-disk software utilities -- such as LaCie's Silverlining, On Track's Disk Manager Mac, and DJK Development's SCSICommander--let users select the interleave.andP;  Their drivers may increaseperformance over those bundled with your drive, if they're compatible withthe drive (most are).andM;The Faster, the BetterandM;Volume aside, for most buyers, speed is the most important drive attribute.andO;Although drivers account for some speed differences between drives, it is themechanism that determines a drive's overall performance.andM;If you plan to use a big hard drive as a server, you need one that canquickly move its read/write heads from track to track.andP;  That's what happenswhen multiple users request data that resides in different places on thedrive's platters.andP;  In that case, you should concentrate on finding a drivewith a low seek time (usually represented in milliseconds) -- the averagetime it takes the read/write heads to move across one third of the platter.andO;Unfortunately, not everyone agrees on how to measure this, so two vendors mayclaim different seek times for the same drive mechanism.andP;  What's more, oncethe data has been found, a drive's throughput -- the amount of data it candeliver to your Mac in a given amount of time -- is more crucial than itsseek time.andM;To obtain a consistent measure of seek time, we used the shareware utilitySCSI Evaluator, available from most on-line services (including Zmac) anduser-group program libraries.andP;  Our benchmark platform consisted of a4-megabyte Mac IIci running System 6.0.5.andP;  Each hard drive was formatted at a1:1 interleave -- the appropriate interleave for the Mac II family -- usingeach vendor's own formatting software.andM;The Deltaic Server 300Q, PLI PL 320FTURBO, and RACET SA 350 tied for firstplace, with average seek times of 12 milliseconds (see Figure 3).andP;  Near theother end of the scale were several drives with 19-millisecond seek times.andO;The Optima MiniPak 310 came in last a 25 milliseconds (the OEM rates it at12.5 milliseconds), because of a special wait state that protects againsttesting programs such as SCSI Evaluator that do multiple seeks]andM;If you're using a stand-alone Mac and working with large files -- 24-bitgraphics, animation sequences, source code, or audio samples -- then youshould search for a drive with a high throughput rate.andP;  A drive's throughputrate--typically expressed as kilobits or megabytes per second -- representshow much data it can deliver in one second.andP;  To measure throughput, weinstructed SCSI Evaluator to write random blocks of data to the drives (seeFigure 4) and measured the results.andM;As a class, drives containing Seagate ST2502NM and ST2383NM mechanisms provedfastest, with throughput rates of around 15,000 kilobits per second.andP;  Speedvariations among like mechanisms can be attributed to manufacturingdeviations and difference in driver software.andP;  The fastest drives are sold byFWB, GCC, la Cie, MicroNet, Procom, and Storage Dimensions.andP;  The slowestdrive by far, the MacProducts magic 380, managed a lowly 8,132 kilobits persecond with its MiniScribe mechanism.andM;Finally, to test real-world speed, we used DiskBahers], a test utilitydeveloped by MacUser Labs.andP;  DiskBasher] simulates typical drive performanceby reading and writing actual &quot;files,&quot; with all the overhead involved.andP;  TheDiskBasher] results (lower times indicate faster drives) have a highcorrelation with the SCSI Evaluator results and are included in Table 2.andM;Ay Your ServiceandM;In one respect, hard drives are like politicians and Sandamp;Ls: The bigger theyare, the harder they fall.andP;  Because you stand to lose so much valuable dataif you experience a problem with a high-capacity hard drive, reliability isan extremely important issue.andP;  Unlike speed, which we can accurately measurewith a suite of benchmarks, there's no way MacUser Labs can empirically testthe long-term reliability of drives.andP;  With MTBF (mean time between failures)ratings in excess of 100,000 hours, we could wait for more than 11 yearsbefore a drive took a dive.andP;  So we did the next-best thing: We investigatedthe service offered by each of the 22 vendors (see Table 1).andM;The warranty periods offered run from the common one year to the trulygenerous five years (Cranel and Microtech).andP;  Some vendors offer optionalextended warranties for an average cost of several hundred dollars per year.andO;The bargain in this category is Deltaic's five years of additional coveragefor only $100.andP;  Given the hourly rates charged by service technicians and thehigh price of replacement parts, extended-warranty plans often pay forthemselves the first time you send a drive in for repair.andP;  One-third of thevendors offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so if you are unhappy with theirproducts for any reason, you can return them for a full refund.andM;If something goes wrong wity your drive, it's comforting to know that help isjust a phone call away.andP;  Although all the vendors we surveyed operatetechnical-support hot lines, only seven provide toll-free support.andP;  If theproblem requires you to return the drive for service, consider where you mustsend it and how long it will take before you get it back.andP;  If you buy a drivemail-order, you usually have to return the drive directly to the vendor,which adds shipping delays to the time required to fix the drive.andM;One of the benefits of buying retail is that you can usually return the driveto the dealer for repair.andP;  Keep in mind, however, that most dealers lackadequate facilities and simply ship the drive back to the manufacturer.andP;  Andsome make no promises whatsoever about turnaround time, although most vendorsattempt to get your drive back to you within two to three working days ofreceipt.andP;  Optima, RACET, and Rodime guarantee 24-hour turnaround timesandgt; atthe opposite end of the spectrum is Cranel's 30-day turnaround time, which ispretty tax.andM;Perhaps the most important service consideration is whether the vendor willattempt to recover your data or will simply swap out faulty mechanisms.andO;Although nobody can guarantee 100-percent success at recovering data from adamaged disk, many common problems can be resolved easily with the help of agood utility program such as Symantec's SUM II or Norton Utilities for theMacintosh.andP;  Vendors that offer data-recovery services (and more than half ofthem do) often do so only at the customer's request and expense.andP;  Dependingon your data's value, you must determine when data recovery becomes acost-prohibitive option.andP;  The best preventive measure is to back up, back up,and then back up again.andP;  To help simplify this tedious chore, investigatesome of the new mirroring and duplexing techniques that automatically copyyour data to another drive (see the &quot;Double-Duty Disks&quot; sidebar.andM;Software BundlesandM;In an effort to differentiate their offerings from competitors', many vendorssweeten their deals with free software.andP;  Bundled software runs the gamut fromscads of shareware freebies thrown in seemingly for sheer volume towell-chosen commercial applications that normally retail for hundreds ofdollars.andP;  GCC, iDS, La Cie, MacProducts, Microtech, Mirror, and PLI all fillup their drives with megabytes of shareware, public-domain, and demowareprograms.andP;  If you're just getting started and need to build a softwarelibrary, these loaded drives may be a good idea, saving you the time andexpense of accumulating the software yourself--although there's no guaranteethat it will all work.andM;More-discriminating buyers may be interested in specific commercial programssuch as DiskFit, Fastback II, MacTools Deluxe, Norton Utilities,Silverlining, SUM II, or SuperSpool, to name a few.andP;  These packages, invarious combinations, are available from CMS, GCC, La Cie, Microtech, Optima,Rodime Systems, Storage Dimensions, and SuperMac.andM;Table 2 includes a checklist of the types of software bundled with each harddrive.andP;  Some of the more useful utilities handle interleave, partitioning,password protection, data encryption, disk optimization, backup, filerecovery, mirroring, and spooling.andM;Partitioning software can divide a large physical drive into several smallerlogical drives that each appear on the desktop individually.andP;  Some vendorsallow you to set up A/UX and ProDOS (The Apple II operating system)partitions on their drives so that you can share the drive with UNIX andApple II users.andM;Password protection prevents others from accessing your drive without yourknowledge.andP;  DAta encryption scrambles the contents of files but does notprevent you from performing regular file maintenance.andM;Disk optimizers improve performance by reorganizing drive contents intocontiguous blocks so that the read/write heads needn't roam the disk lookingfor bits and pieces of files.andP;  Backup software, such as DiskFit, Fastback II,and Total Recall, copies files from the hard drive to another medium forsafekeeping.andP;  File-recovery utilities, such as Norton Utilities and SUM II,can rescue deleted or damaged files.andP;  Finally, print spoolers, such asQuickSpool II and SuperLaserSpool, take care of printing in the background.andM;The Hard PartandM;New drives are appearing all the time, and attentive buyers will want to keeptheir eyes peeled for the latest advances in technology (see the &quot;On theHorizon&quot; sidebar).andP;  Even with the current list of 22 hard drives we tested,making the right selection is difficult.andP;  You must balance your needs againstyour means, make trade-offs between value and speed, and consider a host ofintangibles such as the vendor's reputation, construction quality, andaesthetics.andP;  Although there's no &quot;best&quot; drive for every application, checkout the &quot;Bottom Line&quot; sidebar for our recommendations.andP;  And remember, otherstorage choices are available--for example, if you need enormous storagecapacity that's removable and transportable, look at &quot;Maximum MovableMegabytes: Erasable Optical Drives&quot; in last month's issue.andM;Double-Duty DisksandM;Want up-to-the-millisecond backup of one hard disk onto another without doinga thing?andP;  that's the kind of data security you need in business -- especiallyon a network -- where the crash of a file server can halt your entireoperation.andP;  Two new techniques -- disk duplexing and disk mirroring --provide such supersecurity.andM;Both ideas are simple.andP;  Disk-duplexing systems add an extra SCSI port thatwrites data to a second hard drive at the same time it writes to the primaryport and drive.andP;  Disk mirroring, on the other hand, is a software approachthat first writes data to one hard drive and then to another -- taking twicethe time of a duplexing system.andP;  Both schemes read from one drive only, soperformance doesn't suffer during read operations.andM;Golden Triangle's disk-duplexing system, called Disk Twin, consists of aNuBus SCSI controller board and a cdev that allows you to select the primaryand twin drives and set the duplexer in active or standby mode.andP;  The cardgoes into a NuBus slot on your Mac and the cdev into the drive's SystemFolder.andP;  Most of the time, you never know that Disk Twin is there.andO;Currently, if a fault occurs on the twin, it lets you know via an alertdialog box on your Macandgt; if it's the primary drive, however, your Mac hangsand you need to physically switch to the twin if you want to make it theprimary drive.andP;  A switching mechanism to automate this process is in theworks.andP;  Golden Triangle sells Disk Twin for $995.andP;  Golden Triangle Computers,4849 Ronson Court, San Diego, CA 92111andgt; (619) 279-2100.andM;Hard-disk-drive vendors have begun to offer packages that include the DiskTwin system.andP;  Procom throws one in for free if you buy two hard drives biggerthan 650 megabytes and will sell you one for $495 if you buy two smallerdrives.andP;  CMS intends to offer Disk Twin as part of a new backup product namedGemini.andP;  PLI also plans to offer the Disk Twin system at a special price ifyou buy it with any PLI drive.andM;Relax Technology has a product now under development that will let you &quot;span&quot;up to 12 SCSI hard drives to a single Mac SCSI port.andP;  This board, which willalso contain a 1-megabyte cache, will allow you to duplex any number ofdrives connected to two SCSI ports.andM;Several hard-drive vendors are planning to introduce mirroring software.andO;Storage Dimensions, Optima Technology, Mac-Tel, and FWB all have softwarethat is shipping now or should be shipping by the time this article goes topress.andP;  All these programs will offer the same fault tolerance but with theperformance handicap of duplicate writing cycles.andP;  When the drive is readingdata, however, the programs may actually increase drive speed because ofelevator seeking, which keeps track of the read/write heads in relation tothe requested data and reads the data from the drive whose head is closest toit.andM;One problem both duplexing and mirroring schemes have not yet addressed iswhat happens when software corrupts a hard drive.andP;  If a virus infects onedrive, it will be faithfully copied to the second drive.andP;  One solution, saidto be under development by Optima, is to delay mirroring by a specifiedamount of time.andP;  In conjunction with automated virus-protection software,such a scheme could prevent the doubling of corrupted data.andP;  In that case,fault-tolerant systems could be intolerant just when they need to be.andM;On the HorizonandM;New drives are appearing all the time, even as we go to press.andP;  Micropolis isnow marketing its 330-megabyte Micropolis 1680 directly (it's already the OEMfor several vendors) for $1,995.andP;  And the Metro 335, a new drive from EMACfor $2,499, should be out by the time you read this.andP;  The EMAC drive uses aMaxtor mechanism, has a two-year warranty, and comes bundled with NortonUtilities.andM;Improvements in hard-disk-drive technology also show no signs of slowingdown.andP;  Just around the corner, you're going to see high-capacity drives thatare smaller, cheaper, and faster.andP;  Expect to see more 3.5-inch drives costingless than $4 per megabyte and data-transfer rates pushing 5 megabytes persecond.andM;Faster rotational speeds will help new drives increase both seek times andthroughput rates.andP;  Today, most drives spin at 3,600 rpm.andP;  Drives of tomorrowwill spin at speeds pushing 5,400 rpm, so data will reach a head much fasterafter a seek and will stream through the head at a higher rate.andO;Hewlett-Packard has announced a 4,000-rpm drive, and Micropolis will soonintroduce a 5,400-rpm drive.andM;Seagate Technology has announced two new 3.5-inch, 4,400-rpm hard drives --the 426-megabyte ST1480NM and the 331-megabyte ST1400NM.andP;  According toSeagate, these SCSI units will offer throughput as fast a 5 megabytes persecond and a 14-millisecond seek time.andP;  Expect to see high-speed,high-capacity 3.5-inch drives from Quantum as well.andP;  The new ProDrive 425 andProDrive 330 boast an access time of 14 milliseconds and have a throughput of5 megabytes per second, according to Quantum.andM;Faster SCSI implementations will also help get data into the Mac faster.andO;When you buy a top-of-the-line MicroNet drive, you can now couple it with thecompany's NuPORT, a SCSI NuBus card that replaces the Mac's sluggish1.4-megabyte-per-second SCSI port with its own 4.4-megabyte-per-second SCSIscreamer.andP;  The Mac's current SCSI limitations will disappear when (or if) theemerging SCSI-2 standard is implemented on Macs as well as drives.andP;  SCSI-2provides new protocols that provide better error handling, a wider data bus(and an extra connecting cable), and faster data transfer.andP;  If all aspects ofthe &quot;Wide&quot; and &quot;Fast&quot; SCSI-2 protocols are implemented, throughput couldreach a blazing 40 megabytes per second.andM;The Bottom LineandM;To many people, a hard-disk drive is just a commodity item -- an expensivefiling cabinet.andP;  We'd like to dispel that myth.andP;  Although vendors must choosefrom the same OEM mechanisms available to their competitors, some have takengreat pains to move their products a notch above the others.andM;For general use -- and especially if you're storing large database, graphics,sound, or animation files -- we recommend the high-throughput GCC UltraDrive430S ($2,699), La Cie ZFP 400 ($1,999), and MicroNet MS-404 ($3,795).andP;  Allthree drives are based on the same 423-megabyte Seagate ST2502NM mechanism,which has the greatest average throughput (15,248K per second) of all themechanisms we evaluated and has a respectable seek time of around 15milliseconds.andM;All have carefully assembled custom-designed cases -- the MicroNet MS-404especially shows excellent-quality workmanship.andP;  We couldn't rate it higherthan the GCC and La Cie offerings, however, because it's substantially moreexpensive and does not come with any bundled software aside from aproprietary installation utility.andM;For a thousand dollars less, GCC includes a QuickDraw print spooler, SUM II,3.5 megabytes of public-domain software, and its own envelope-printingutility.andM;La Cie bundles 5 megabytes of public-domain software, its own Silverliningformatting software, and the Norton Utilities for drive maintenance andrepair.andP;  Both firms offer comprehensive service options, and GCC even backsits drive with a 30-day money-back guarantee.andP;  Of all the high-capacitydrives, the price/performance champ is the very affordable La Cie ZFP 400,its only flaw being internal termination.andM;If you're equipping a network server, two other drives to consider are theStorage Dimensions 325-S1 ($3,499) and FWB Hammer 300 ($3,495).andP;  Both use the325-megabyte Seagate ST2383NM mechanism and carry similar list prices, andboth are often heavily discounted to around $2,350.andP;  The throughput of thesedrives almost equals that of the ST2502NM drives mentioned earlier, and seektimes are even better (13 milliseconds).andP;  The Hammer 300 just missed afive-mouse rating, because of its undistinguished proprietary software andgeneric metal case.andP;  The Storage Dimensions 325-S1 has a custom plastic case,the front of which pops off to reveal that the unit is prewired to accept asecond mechanism in the same housing -- a nice option if you foresee addingmore storage capacity in the future.andM;Although it is the most cost-effective drive on a price-per-megabyte basis,don't be tempted by the MacProducts Magic 380 ($1,395).andP;  It's the slowest ofall the drives by far and is a bear to set up because of its software SCSI-IDselection, internal termination, and unshielded 25-pin SCSI connectors.andM;San Francisco author Owen W.
