White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday, ``from ourpoint of view, the 100th Congress has been very productive and weare extraordinarily pleased that so many parts of the president'sagenda have been enacted into law.''   Fitzwater said Congress, which adjourned early Saturday, leftabout 120 bills on Reagan's desk. The president will veto some andsign the others, Fitzwater said, but the spokesman did not knowwhich ones would be rejected.   Shortly before Congress adjourned, Senate Majority Leader RobertByrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues the Democratic-controlled 100thCongress had a record ``of decisive action. We have producedresults across the board.''   But Byrd added that ``even so, much remains to be tackled, andour time is about to expire. The 101st Congress has some formidablechallenges to address.''   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., agreed. ``I think itwas quite successful, overall, but there were also some things wedidn't get that we would have liked.''   A number of the unresolved issues involve domestic policyfights, such as the minimum wage, family-related legislation andcleaning up the nation's air.   Since 1981, the minimum wage has been $3.35 per hour, butDemocrats in recent months pushed for an increase. It was a drivethey hoped to turn into political gains during the electioncampaign.   Democrats succeeded in bringing to the Senate floor a bill thatwould have raised the minimum wage to $4.55 per hour over athree-year period, but Republicans said they would filibusterunless the Judiciary Committee voted to approve 25 of PresidentReagan's judicial appointments.   The Senate tried to cut off debate, but that move only picked up56 votes, four short of the 60 needed. That moved minimum wagelegislation to the back burner.   A look at some of the other unfinished business:</TEXT><TEXT>   CLEAN AIR _ The Senate considered a bill which would have triedto control acid rain by restricting smokestack emissions, alongwith tightening auto-emission standards and restricting the burningof toxic chemicals. But there was strong opposition in both theHouse and Senate, particularly from legislators representing statesproducing low-sulfur coal such as those in the Rocky Mountain area.   CHILD CARE _ The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committeevoted approval in July of a bill providing $2.5 billion for childcare, with 75 percent of that amount ticketed for low- andmoderate-income families. But opposition by a variety of groups,including the National Education Association and the NationalParent Teachers Association, stalled floor action. They wereopposed because some of the money would go to child-care centerssponsored by religious institutions.   PARENTAL LEAVE _ Democrats backed a proposal to requireemployers of 50 or more people to give up to 10 weeks of unpaidparental and medical leave. Senate Republicans attached anamendment making child pornography a federal crime. Democrats triedto strip that provision out of the bill, but failed.   IMPEACHMENT _ The House voted 413-3 on Aug. 3 to impeach U.S.District Court Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida for high crimesand misdemeanors, alleging perjury and conspiracy to receive abribe. The Senate later decided to postpone the impeachment trialuntil 1989.   The House also delayed impeachment proceedings against U.S.District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. of Mississippi. Nixon is servinga five-year prison term for perjury.   SOUTH AFRICA SANCTIONS _ On Aug. 11, the House voted 244-132approval of a bill to prohibit almost all trade with white-ruledSouth Africa. It also would have barred South African imports. TheSenate Foreign Relations Committee approved similar legislation,but filibuster threats blocked any floor action.   AIRLINE CONSUMER PROTECTION _ The House approved a billrequiring airlines to disclose information on flight delays andcompensation for workers hurt by mergers. The Senate passed asimilar bill, but a House-Senate conference committee called toresolve differeces broke down in fighting over provisions for therandom testing of transportation industry employees.   CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM _ Senate Democrats backed a bill cappingthe amount senators could receive from political action committees.Republicans filibustered and there were eight unsuccessful votesattempting to halt the filibuster. During one procedural fight overthe filibuster, arrest warrants were issued for missing senatorsand Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., was brought forcibly to the Senatefloor.   NUCLEAR TREATIES _ Still awaiting action are a pair of treatiesnegotiated between the Soviet Union and United States more than adecade ago. They would restrict nuclear explosions to no more than150 kilotons. President Reagan had promised to push forratification if an improved method could be found to verify thepacts.</TEXT></DOC>
