(ICL) of Britain andSiemens AG of West Germany, are all currently contemplating the benefits ofcloser technology ties with each other in the wake of the binding mandatehanded down by Brussels.andP;  That mandate, originally scheduled to open up theeconomic borders of the EEC's 12 member nations in 1992, is now set to gointo full force on January 1 of the next year.andM;The groundwork for these closer links has already been established throughearlier cooperative alliances (see &quot;Europe's Grand Alliances,&quot; February 1,1990, p. 81).andP;  In addition, all three system suppliers have inked variouspartnership pacts with other vendors, some that date back more than a decade.andM;Leading the pack in the partnership race is Siemens, which is not onlyplanning to acquire a majority stake in Nixdorf Computer AG but iscollaborating with Fujitsu Ltd., General Electric Co. (GEC) of Britain, IBM,Intel Corp., IN2, NV Philips' GL and Rolm.andP;  Neck and neck in that race forcooperative agreements are Bull and ICL.andP;  Bull's coterie of IS collaboratorsincludes NEC Corp. and Olivetti.andP;  Fujitsu Ltd. and Metatech GmbH are amongICL's alliances.andM;Some IS specialists believe that such corporate liaisons are a prerequisitefor European survival in an increasingly competitive and contentious computermarket.andP;  One person who clearly sees the efficacy of pan-European pairings inthe IS industry is Alan Roussel, who is responsible for ICL's Europeanstrategy.andP;  Rousel likens the current situation in the European IS industry towhat happened in the European airline business.andM;That business got a big boost when the British, French, Spanish and WestGermans got together in a powerful consortium to form Airbus Industrie.andO;Airbus, declares, Roussel, is &quot;a true competitor for the Boeings and theMcDonnell Douglases, thank God.andP;  And it has ensured the survival of the[European] aircraft industry.andP;  I believe that our industry is going in asimilar direction.&quot;andM;For the computer market, Roussel goes on, &quot;I believe the long-term solutionis to bring together three or four of the top seven European companies.andP;  Andwe all believe that.&quot;andP;  More specifically, Roussel says, he sees anopportunity for Bull, ICL and Siemens, working in concert, to write off theirlarge-systems development efforts.andP;  These development chores are currentlyeating up the lion's share of ICL's Randamp;D funds.andP;  Roussel goes on to speculatethat the resulting Euro-mainframe, perhaps based on UNIX, could also fly theopen systems flag.andM;Roussel's views on trilateral teamwork, which at one time would have been ahanging offense if aired inside ICL, find Georges Grunberg, Bull vicepresident for European cooperation, &quot;tout a fait d'accord.&quot;andP;  Nevertheless,Grunberg is less concerned about the European mainframe arena than he isabout the paucity of PC and peripherals from pan-European vendors.andP;  In bothequipment categories, Europe is piling up mounting trade deficits with Japanand the United States.andM;&quot;We are moving toward downsizing, toward the desktop.andP;  So, it seems much moreimportant to look at what we are doing in the micro and workstations areasthan [to look at] mainframes,&quot; explains Grunberg.andM;It's worth noting that while Bull's PCs are made in France, its DPS 90mainframes are produced in Japan by NEC.andP;  But, pretty soon, many of Bull'sPCs could be coming from the States if the company's acquisition of ZenithElectronics Corp. goes through.andP;  Grunberg says that this acquisition may nothave been necessary for Bull if a Euro-PC had existed.andM;No Peripherals in EuropeandM;European users have also come to rely on the Japanese for peripheralspower--a fact of life that troubles Grunberg.andP;  &quot;Europe has virtually pulledout of peripherals.andP;  The only solution,&quot; he adamantly declares, &quot;is to havecommon production.andM;&quot;Rather than leave 95% of the nonimpact printer market to the Japanese,&quot;Grunberg says, he would like to see joint European production of thishardware.andP;  He readily admits, however, that this theory &quot;is so obvious thateveryone in Europe is agreed in principle.andP;  The difficulty is to put it intopractice.&quot;andM;Hans Dieter Wiedig, president of Siemens' data and information systems group,agrees with Grunberg's call for a European peripherals industry, saying thatit is basically the right approach.andP;  He's also in favor of cooperation inspecific IS areas.andP;  &quot;The product field is so broad that it's impossible tocover it with your own Randamp;D budget,&quot; he maintains.andP;  Although Wiedig feels thatjoint development efforts are worth examining, he doesn't think it wouldserve Siemens' interests to join forces with other companies in a singleproduction facility.andP;  The company currently has a factory that churns outPCs, UNIX systems and various peripherals.andP;  So, any common PC plant, hereasons, would have to produce significant volumes for it to be worthwhilefor Siemens.andM;Wiedig is even more adamant in nixing any Euro-mainframe efforts.andP;  &quot;Theidentification of a company,&quot; he insists, lies &quot;in its mainframe system.&quot;andO;Also on the mainframe side, the Siemens systems chief is equally skepticalabout UNIX and about the possibility of combining the various architecturesinto one generic mainframe.andM;Users Remain SkepticalandM;Also opposing this one-for-all European mainframe concept is Pierre La Salle,head of the European IBM GUIDE user group, who doesn't think that the Airbusexperience can be repeated within the IS industry.andP;  European data centers,with their existing software investment and entrenchment in the IBM 360world, are unlikely to trash their technology overnight for the sake of theEuropean computer industry, he argues.andM;Nevertheless, European cooperation among vendors would be warmly welcome bymost IS professionals.andP;  Hoping that day of decision will come sooner ratherthan later, Ken Wingfield, chairman of the ICL Users Association, speculatesthat &quot;ICL will come to some major collaboration with somebody.&quot;andP;  Heembellishes that thought with the theory that the resulting link will givecustomers of the British IS company a wider choice of &quot;the best of allpossible hardware and software.&quot;andM;ICL's own European strategist, Roussel, shares Wingfield's optimism, eventhough he is uncertain of the specifics of the arrangement.andP;  &quot;We all know thesolution is to create a bigger mass by coming together in some form.andP;  Theonly issue is what form, who and when.&quot;andM;Trevor Huggins is a freelance journalist based in Paris.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
