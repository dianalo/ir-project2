Reps. JimmyHayes and W.J. Tauzin have been arguing for the prerogativeof their and other states to determine proper wetlandspolicy, while proponents of a national &quot;no net loss&quot; policywant to hand the matter over to ostensibly objectivescientists. The Congressmen make the point that decisions onresource use have social and economic impacts as well asenvironmental, and therefore should be made in an openlypolitical manner and not under scientific cover (the dodgeCongress has long used in turning over policy to agenciessuch as EPA). We'd only add that all decision-making in thisarea will be political, no matter who does it, until propertyrights in resources make a market alternative possible.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
