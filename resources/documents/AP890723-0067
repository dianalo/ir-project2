Carlos Jimenez, a spokesman at the Public Security Ministry,said Costa Rican authorities had lost sight of rancher John Hullsince Thursday. He refused to say whether Hull had left the country.   ``I suspect that Mr. Hull has been kidnapped,'' said Juan JoseSobrado, Hull's lawyer.   ``Something similar occurred in 1982, when Hector Frances waskidnapped by a leftist commando with links to (Nicaragua's)Sandinista regime,'' Sobrado said. He referred to an Argentinecitizen who allegedly worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.   Hull, 69, from Evansville, Ind., has lived in Costa Rica for thepast 20 years, and became a naturalized citizen seven years ago. Helives on a ranch in the northern part of the country, near theNicaraguan border.   Hull has been indicted in Costa Rica on charges of drugtrafficking and violating state security, but no trial date hasbeen set. He pleaded innocent and was released on $37,500 bailafter his doctors said he had suffered a heart attack.   A Costa Rican congressional commission on Thursday recommendedthat Hull be stripped of his citizenship and expelled from thecountry.   According to the commission, planes secretly landed at Hull'shillside ranch to smuggle weapons from 1984 to 1985 toU.S.-supported Contra rebels fighting in southern Nicaragua.   The planes also allegedly ferried drugs out of the country to besold in the United States to pay for the weapons.   The commission also recommended that former National SecurityAdviser John Poindexter, former former Marine Lt. Col. OliverNorth, former Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, and LewisTambs, a former ambassador to Costa Rica, be barred from everentering Costa Rica.   North, a security aide, was a leader in a covert effort to aidthe Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas fighting the leftist Sandinistagovernment in Managua at a time when such aid had been prohibitedby the U.S. Congress.He and other American officials visited CostaRica to give Hull and the Contras instructions.   A person who answered the telephone Sunday at Hull's Muelle SanJose ranch, 100 miles north of the capital, said: ``We have nocomment ... Mr. Hull is not at the ranch.''   Margarita Acosta, his Costa Rican wife, also said she did notknow where Hull was.   ``I have not heard from my husband since Tuesday, although hecalled to tell me he is fine. But he did not tell me where hewas,'' Mrs. Hull told the newspaper La Nacion in an interviewpublished Sunday.   Mrs. Hull said she called her husband's relatives in Evansville,``but they told me they have not heard from him.''</TEXT></DOC>
