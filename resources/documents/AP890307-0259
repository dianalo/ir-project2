Leonard said the airline was forced to halt nearly all itsoperations because its pilots had firmly supported the 8,500-memberMachinists union, which represents mechanics and ramp serviceworkers.   ``If our pilots had come to work, this strike would be over,'' hesaid. ``We could have easily flown through a machinists strike.''   The nation's airline pilots today began a job action that hadthreatened to clog air travel on most airlines, but few delays werereported by noon.   Eastern Airlines on Monday sent more than 7,000 non-strikingemployees home, and Leonard said today that just 1,500 employeesremain working, down from from 31,200 before the strike. The airlinehad announced Monday it sent home 5,000 workers, but today Leonardsaid the figure actually was 7,000.   Leonard reiterated that a move to bankruptcy court was a lastresort, and said, ``We don't have any plans to throw in the towel.''   Flights were slightly delayed at some airports this morning, butofficials said it was too early to know whether to blame badweather, normal delays or a nationwide pilots' effort to strictlyadhere to all regulations.   ``The reports we have are that there has been no effect onoperations,'' said Capt. Roger Hall, a national spokesman for theAir Line Pilots Association. The union continues to contend it isnot conducting a slowdown, but is adapting to ``highly unusualcircumstances'' it says threaten safety.   This morning in Washington, President Bush said pilots should not``make the innocent traveling public a pawn'' and stood by hisopposition to government intervention to stop the Machinists unionwalkout.   In New York today, unions representing workers at three suburbanrail lines that serve more than 300,000 commuters appealed a courtorder barring them from honoring any picket lines the Machinists setup at railways. A hearing was set for Wednesday.   Lawyers for the Machinists and the Brotherhood of RailroadSignalmen asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn anorder by U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson. Patterson todayextended his order, which had been effective until 3 p.m. ESTWednesday, to midnight Friday. It bars workers at those commuterlines from walking off the job in sympathy with strikers.   The Eastern strike, which began Saturday and culminated a17-month labor dispute, grounded most of the airline's flights,stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nation'sseventh-largest airline to the brink of collapse. The airline wants$150 million in concessions; the Machinists want $50 million inraises.   ``We cannot run an airline with unpredictability,'' Easternspokesman Robin Matell told reporters in Miami. ``We cannot continueto inconvenience passengers. We cannot afford the steady financialdrain.''   Matell said Eastern would continue only its most profitableroutes _ its shuttle between Washington, New York and Boston, andthree round trips weekly between Miami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, andSantiago, Chile.   Full-page advertisements for Eastern today in The New York Times,The Washington Post and The Boston Globe urged ``Fly Us With NoReservations'' and promised that the shuttle is operating every hour.   Henry Duffy, president of the ALPA, asked its 40,000-memberpilots nationwide, beginning at 6 a.m. EST today, to adhere to rules``to ensure the safety of the system,'' which he said had beenweakened by the Eastern disruptions.   As the workday began, air traffic was not crippled.   ``Everything's quiet,'' said Mildred Schneider, spokeswoman forthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates thethree major New York-area airports. Asked if pilots were conductinga slowdown, she said, ``No one has given me that indication.''   The U.S. Department of Transportation set up a special controlcenter in Washington to monitor the ALPA action. By 10:30 a.m. EST,no unusual delays were reported, said spokesman Hal Paris, adding,``We won't have anything until this afternoon, probably lateafternoon.''   By 8:30 a.m. EST, no delays were posted on flight-status boardsat counters of major carriers at Miami International Airport.   National Airport flights began as usual at 7 a.m., and someflights took off, said Dave Hess, spokesman for the MetropolitanWashington Airport Authority. ``We won't have a handle on this untilmid-day,'' he said about any possible disruption.   ``If there a slowdown here, we can't see it,'' said John Braden,spokesman at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. ``We have somuch excess capacity because Eastern's not flying we can absorb anysuch delays anyway.''   Federal Aviation Administration inspectors have been monitoringEastern closely and have found no safety lapses, said AnthonyBroderick, FAA associate director. He said the agency was preparedto deal with the pilots' action.   On Monday, Eastern asked a federal judge in Miami to order itspilots to cross Machinist union picket lines. A hearing wasscheduled today.   Eastern canceled almost all flights Monday, although someNortheast shuttle flights left despite a snowstorm in the New YorkCity area. Pan Am Corp. doubled its rival hourly shuttle service totake advantage of Eastern's troubles.   Matell said the 5,000 to 6,000 idled non-union employees werenotified immediately of their ``no-work'' status and would receivelump-sum payments from $270 to $640, depending on their wages. Theyinclude ticket and reservations agents, clerical workers, customerservice workers and some managers.   ``My father went to work for Eastern in 1949, the year I wasborn,'' said gate agent Steve Moss in Atlanta. ``This company hasraised me from a child. And all I can say is that now I'm ashamedabout what the current management has done to Eastern.''   Some of those laid off joined striking Eastern Machinists onpicket lines.   Matell said about 200 pilots out of 3,600 were flying, but thepilots union put the number at 88.   ``We're not the ones who sought the strike,'' said John J. Bavis,head of the Eastern Air Line Pilots Association local. ``This is astrike that Mr. Lorenzo called.''   The anti-union reputation of Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern'sparent Texas Air Corp., has galvanized Eastern's unionized employees.   Eastern's 5,900 flight attendants also have honored theMachinists strike.   Before the strike, Miami-based Eastern claimed losses of morethan $1 billion during the last decade, and $1 million daily. Italso said it had $2.5 billion in debts stemming from its acquisitionby Texas Air Corp. in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
