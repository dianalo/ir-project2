TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ABOARD THE ISRAELI CORVETTE GEULA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel is buildingthree huge missile boats and two submarines under a U.S-financedprogram that will better equip it to thwart terrorist attacks, thenation's navy chief says.   Rear Adm. Avraham Ben-Shoshan outlined details of the $1.2billion program on Tuesday, Navy Day. He said the submarines andtwo of the three missile boats should be deployed by the mid-1990s.   ``The terrorists are making serious efforts to invest people,resources and training to develop a better capability. We must beprepared in time,'' Ben-Shoshan said.   The missile boats will carry new weapons against aircraft,missiles and submarines. The new ships, each to cost $120 million,are nearly 400 feet long and will accommodate more weaponry andhelicopters.   ``We believe this ship must carry many weapons because we have alot of enemies and very few missile boats,'' said Ben-Shoshan.   He said one new weapons system is the Barak anti-missilemissile, to be deployed in the early 1990s. Described as highlyaccurate, it carries an explosive head weighing 48 pounds and canbe used at a range up to 7{ miles.   Ben-Shoshan said the anti-missile missile was preferable tosystems designed to confuse and divert incoming missiles.   ``We must have a hard kill, and the Barak system gives us a hardkill. This will be the answer to the missile threat for the Israelinavy,'' he said.   He said the system could also be used against helicopters andships.   The new ships are needed to replace French-designed boats up to20 years old. Those include some of the vessels Israel commandeeredfrom Cherbourg after France imposed an arms embargo because of the1967 Middle East war.   According to the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel AvivUniversity, Israel's navy has 28 missile-carrying ships, includingtwo highspeed hydrofoil craft shown for the first time Tuesday.   The Geula, demonstrated for reporters outside Israel's northernport of Haifa, is Israel's largest ship.   The Israeli-built vessel is 198 feet long, weighs 450 tons andcarries a helicopter. It is armed with U.S.-made Harpoonsurface-to-surface missiles and Vulcan Phalanx anti-aircraft guns.   Ben-Shoshan said the terrorist threat remains high even thoughguerrillas launched just five attacks from the sea last year.   In the past three years, the navy has killed 58 guerrillas andcaptured 100, he said.   During the past year, the navy stopped two attempts by LebaneseShiite Moslems to plant mines and on two occasions destroyedguerrilla boats hiding among fishing vessels off Lebanon,Ben-Shoshan said. It also stopped a rubber raft trying to enterIsraeli waters.   Ben-Shoshan reached agreement with U.S. officials on financingthe expansion program during a visit to Washington in June.   He said U.S. firms are bidding to build the ship and varioussystems and West Germany was among European countries competing tobuild the submarines.   Israel has three aging British-made Vickers Type 206 submarines.It turned to European manufacturers after the United States refusedto build the diesel-powered submarines. Ben-Shoshan gave no detailson the new submarines.   The admiral defended Israel's stopping ships in internationalwaters of the Mediterranean, saying it has to go as far afield asneeded to protect its coastline.   He said Israel's navy stopped 40 ships in the past year andabout four were found to have hostile intent. The navy impounded 10other vessels carrying 10 tons of drugs, most of it hashish, headded.</TEXT></DOC>
