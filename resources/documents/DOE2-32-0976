In future, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energywill increase and substitute petroleum. Underground resources will exhaustsomeday. Japan, being poor in natural resources, brings efforts on thediversification of energy sources it depends on and on energy conservation.Hydraulic power generation, which is renewable, is 21 % of all of powergeneration (13 % in Japan). Geothermal power generation, which is alsorenewable, is 0.2%. Energy such as solar energy, wind power, and wavepower has much of input fluctuation and needs storage faciiity. The powerplants using these sources are limited for remote areas because of highcost. Biomass energy is also of high cost and supplementary. Petroleumimporting countries have private and national stocks of primary energy.Nuclear fuel has the highest storage density. Storage of secondary energysuch as pumped storage power and power storage by compressed air hasmany restrictions. As for transportation cost, marine transport is lowest,by pipelines and railways is lower. The transportation of electric powerand hot water is of high cost. It is important to improve the utilizationtechnology of nuclear energy and coal, and to develop the energy conservationtechnology such as cogeneration system and heat pumps.
