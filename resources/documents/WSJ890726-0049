The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, said Comsat has attempted by itself and with others to monopolize the commercial satellite market in the U.S., and has tried to stifle competition through unfair pricing and other methods.    In Washington, D.C., a Comsat spokesman denounced the lawsuit, calling it &quot;groundless and particularly ironic because Comsat took a leadership role&quot; in urging other members of the International Telecommunications Satelite Organization to approve Pan American's operations.    Created in 1962 by a federal law, Comsat is the U.S. government's representative on Intelsat and on the International Maritime Satellite Organization, Inmarsat. Intelsat, an international consortium, owns and operates a world-wide satellite system for voice, data, facsimile and video transmissions. Inmarsat, a similar cooperative, provides maritime communications.    &quot;We compete fairly and legally and -- we believe -- effectively,&quot; the spokesman said. The suit seems to follow a pattern of harassment by Pan American Satellite, he said, referring to challenges by the closely held Greenwich, Conn., company to Comsat proposals before the Federal Communications Commission.    The lawsuit claims more than $500 million in damages and seeks to treble that amount under antitrust statutes.    The suit charges that Comsat urged other Intelsat signatories to boycott any competing systems, including Pan American. It alleges that Comsat told actual and potential customers that Pan American wouldn't be able to get necessary agreements to transmit signals to foreign countries. And it charges that Comsat has priced its services &quot;without regard to cost, below average variable cost, or at a predatory level&quot; to discourage competition.    In an interview from Peru, Pan American's Reynold Anselmo said that it hopes to force Intelsat &quot;to stop all of the shenanigans that have been going on for so long.&quot; Eventually, he said, he would like to see Intelsat scrapped. If private companies were allowed to compete fairly, he said, the result would be better service at cheaper rates.    Pan American is a sole proprietorship, the brainchild of Mr. Anselmo, a businessman who has spent about $90 million to build, launch and market a satellite designed to transmit broadcast and data signals in Latin America, North America and Western Europe.    Mr. Anselmo came up with the idea in the early 1980s when, as president and an owner of the Spanish International Network and 23 Spanish-language TV stations, he was stung by the high cost of transmitting programming from Mexico.    In 1985, the FCC approved the notion of separate satellite systems for international communications, but prevented them from linking up with the public switched telephone network. The FCC gave Pan American final approval in 1987, and a French Ariane rocket lofted the company's first satellite in June 1988. Efforts to market its services have been frustrated, however, by politically powerful telephone monopolies in many Latin American countries.    The first breakthrough came in Peru. To crack what it alleged was an Intelsat boycott, Pan American offered Peru use of a transponder covering the entire country as well as Ecuador, Bolivia and parts of Chile for $1 a year.    In the lawsuit, Pan American said it would have sold out capacity on its satellite and recovered its capital investment around the time of its June 1988 launch if Comsat and Intelsat hadn't interfered. </TEXT></DOC>
