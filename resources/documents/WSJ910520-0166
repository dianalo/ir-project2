Following the same impulse, we wondered how the leaders ofthe personal-computer industry have set up their own homePCs. These are people who spend their days evangelizing aboutthe power of the PC to transform all aspects of working andplaying. Do they practice what they preach when they get homeat night?</LP><TEXT>   We sought out a sampling of PC powerhouses from around thecountry. Here is what we found out:                                                                                                          JAMES CANNAVINO   Vice president,   International Business Machines Corp.                                                                                                          -- James Cannavino, who heads IBM's personal-systemsbusiness, uses two PCs to run his household, a horse farm inrural Dutchess County, N.Y. A third PC serves as an umbilicalcord to his office in Somers, N.Y., one hour away. And yetanother device, a laptop computer, travels home with himevery night.   Not surprisingly, all four machines are emblazoned withthe IBM logo. One of the machines is IBM's new PersonalSystem/1 home computer, which Mr. Cannavino has made thefocus of his promise to &quot;put a computer in every kitchen.&quot;   True to his word, he keeps his own PS/1 in the kitchen anduses it mainly to access Prodigy, an information servicejointly run by IBM and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. Prodigy is greatfor ordering flowers and reserving plane tickets, he says.Mr. Cannavino also spends a lot of time playing the &quot;PGAGolf&quot; game.   His other home computer, a souped-up Personal System/2Model 70, sits in a combination office-den. He and his wife,Suzie, use the device to determine horseriding schedules,feeding routines and the like. They use WordPerfect Corp.'sword-processing software, and he likes a popularcheck-writing program called Quicken.   Mr. Cannavino does all his company work on a third PC hekeeps in his private office. (&quot;The cleaning lady needs anappointment just to get in.&quot;) There, he uses a high-end PS/2Model 80 that connects into IBM's internal network; he usesit most evenings to read and send electronic mail, to runbusiness calculations and to mark up documents. He has an IBMlaser printer there, too, and sometimes he brings work homein his PS/2 Model L40 SX laptop computer.   Also crammed into Mr. Cannavino's office is anever-changing cast of PCs made by both IBM and its rivals:Intent on doing &quot;my own form of competitive analysis,&quot; hesays he sets them up at home and puts them through theirpaces. One spring day, for example, he is comparing aworkstation made by Next Computer Inc., a Macintosh computerfrom Apple Computer, and a high-end IBM PS/2 Model 95.   Mr. Cannavino doesn't limit such at-home tinkering topersonal computers: He once hooked up an entire IBMminicomputer system of the type used by small businesses,just to see if it was as easy to install and use as hiscompany claimed. (It was, he says.) And when he ran IBM'smainframe operation, he brought home a machine from the lowend of that line. Even now, he occasionally threatens to rollup a truck and unload one of IBM's biggest machines, amonster mainframe that requires a water supply to cool itscircuits.   &quot;Whenever my wife starts to complain about me bringing allmy junk home, I just leave a big water pipe laying around thehouse,&quot; he says. &quot;She quiets down real fast.&quot;                                                                                                          ROBERT LUCKY   Executive director/research for communications sciences,   ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories                                                                                                          -- Robert Lucky, one of Bell Labs' top theorists about thefuture of personal computing, used to build his own PCs andwrite his own programs. &quot;I lament the passing of those days,&quot;he says. &quot;Now there's very little you can design and buildfor yourself. Any program I could write, I could buysomething a lot better at the local software store.&quot;   To recapture some of that old adventure, Mr. Lucky uses amail-order 386-chip PC clone whose manufacturer he doesn'teven remember. &quot;I don't think I'd recommend it for everybody-- you're going to get no hand-holding, no support,&quot; he says.   His Fair Haven, N.J., home has a 30-megabyte hard disk, anold dot-matrix printer, and an ATandamp;T 2400-baud modem. He alsocarries around a CompuAdd four-pound laptop computer with a286 chip.   Mr. Lucky uses his home PC in a room dubbed &quot;the dungeon&quot;by his wife. It's a basement office lined with books andstuffed with &quot;electronic junk,&quot; including a synthesizer andspeakers.   The synthesizer is his latest home-computing obsession.Mr. Lucky plays both piano and violin, and he always wantedto accompany himself in duets. Today he does this by hookingup his synthesizer and his PC, and using a &quot;sequencing&quot;program to enter each note of the piano part into the PC.Then the synthesizer plays it back, And he can adjust thetiming, note by note. &quot;Now when I'm on airplanes, peopledon't understand why I'm typing with this music score in mylap,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          PATRICK MCGOVERN   Chairman,   International Data Group                                                                                                          -- Traveling an estimated 250,000 miles a year, PatrickMcGovern doesn't have much time to use his PC at home. &quot;I'mnot a far-out power user,&quot; says the founder and chairman ofInternational Data Group, a computer-magazine publisher basedin Framingham, Mass.   Even when he isn't traveling, Mr. McGovern spends just sixor seven hours a week using the Macintosh in the office hehas set up in a gatehouse about 150 feet from his home. Hespends about 60% of his time doing business or financial workon his PC, using a word processor (Microsoft Word), aspreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) and desktop publishing (AldusPagemaker) to print things on his Applewriter laser printer.   He confesses to spending the other 40% of his time usinghis Mac to play games. His favorites are Mac Golf; Balance ofPower, which simulates political and economic interactionamong countries; and Maxis's SimCity and SimEarthenvironmental-impact games.   Mr. McGovern's Macintosh, which has an 80-megabyte harddrive, is equipped with an Avatex 2400-baud modem forcommunications. &quot;I receive a lot of messages from colleaguesaround the world,&quot; he says. He also occasionally checksbulletin-board services like Prodigy and CompuServe, to readchatter about new products and prices.   Mr. McGovern doesn't use a portable PC. &quot;There's too muchhassle with security getting it in and out of airplanes,&quot; heexplains.                                                                                                          JOHN ROACH   Chairman and CEO,   Tandy Corp.                                                                                                          -- John Roach has two computers in his Fort Worth, Texas,home: a Tandy 1000 TL2 and the new Tandy 1000 RL homecomputer.   The 1000 RL sits in the Roach's kitchen, and familymembers use it to leave messages for one another via itselectronic-bulletin-board program. They use the file managerto store addresses and phone numbers, the grocery list tomonitor their home inventory of food, and the home organizerfor personal finance.   It isn't surprising that the computer is used exactly asTandy hopes other families use it: The prototype was testedand approved by Mr. Roach's wife.   The 1000 TL2 is shared by Mr. Roach and his daughter, asenior in high school. His daughter uses the computer forword processing when writing term papers. Mr. Roach uses theTandy DeskMate versions of Qandamp;A and Lotus to complete work athome that he doesn't finish in the office.                                                                                                          ROD CANION   President,   Compaq Computer Corp.                                                                                                          -- Rod Canion uses the Compaq LTE 386s/20 notebookcomputer with the desk-bound docking station. Mr. Canionchose this model over all the other Compaq machines becausehe can take the notebook computer with him while travelingand pop the whole unit into the docking station when hereturns home to the Houston area. The docking station has itsown full-sized keyboard and color monitor but uses thenotebook's hard disk, so Mr. Canion never needs to updatefiles on a second computer.   Mr. Canion's computer has stored on its hard disk aspreadsheet, word processor and several games. After playingmany games of Microsoft's Flight Simulator, Mr. Caniondecided to take up real-life flying. He is now a fullyqualified small-plane pilot.                                                                                                          KAZUHIKO NISHI   President,   Ascii Corp.                                                                                                          -- Kazuhiko Nishi, whose Tokyo-based diversified company'sofferings include software and computer magazines, owns twoApple Macintosh computers at home: an early model in hiskitchen, next to his electric oven and refrigerator, and acolor SE in his study. An Apple Talk network device connectsthe two machines and a laser printer.   His software includes Apple's Hypercard data organizer, aswell as a communications package for accessing data basessuch as Dow Jones News Retrieval and Nexis. &quot;When I startthinking, I need to know what is the latest news aboutCompaq&quot; or other companies, says Mr. Nishi, one of Japan'smost colorful and extravagant high-tech entrepreneurs. &quot;It'svery convenient to have access to such a thing. I don't evenhave to read the newspaper.&quot;   The kitchen Mac is &quot;really a Rolodex,&quot; he says. His wifeuses it for addresses, and the couple also send faxes fromit.   Mr. Nishi pointedly doesn't do a couple of common thingswith his home computers, including writing messages throughelectronic mail. &quot;Then I have to keep coding the computer,&quot;he says. &quot;I want all my communications to go through mysecretary.&quot;   Also, &quot;I used to maintain a lot of data bases on the Macfor my financials, but now I have my personal assistant whodoes such a thing. I do corrections of that but there's notmuch I have to do on my computer.&quot;                                                                                                          ROBERT FRANKSTON   Software developer,   Slate Corp.                                                                                                          -- Co-developer of Visicalc, the first spreadsheet, RobertFrankston is a power user. His Newton, Mass., home office isequipped with two PCs -- an 80486-based machine and an80386-based machine -- that he put together by &quot;randomassemblage&quot; of parts.   While many PC users get by with a 1,200- or a 2,400-baudmodem, he uses a 9,600-baud modem. (&quot;You need speed.&quot;) He hasa high-resolution video board capable of displaying 256colors on his computer screen. And he has an NEC laserprinter. (&quot;Can you live without a laser printer?&quot;)   &quot;I'm generally ahead of the curve on hardware -- Ianticipate what's going to be standard,&quot; says Mr. Frankston,who is helping Slate Corp. become one of the first pen-basedsoftware companies.   Mr. Frankston's most-used software is Lotus Notes, aprogram for communicating and sharing information with othersover a network. &quot;It gives me powerful electronic mail thatcan appear on my office computer and home computer, and isaccessible on my portable on the road,&quot; he says. He usesWindows Word and Lotus Ami word processors. He has MicrosoftExcel and Lotus 1-2-3 G spreadsheets, although, he says, &quot;Ihate to admit that I hardly use {spreadsheets}.&quot;   Another favorite program/service is Checkfree, whichenables him to pay bills electronically. &quot;Instead of writingchecks by hand, you transmit {the bill information}electronically, and Checkfree withdraws money from your bankaccount and issues the checks,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          NOLAN BUSHNELL   General Manager, interactive consumer products division,   Commodore International Ltd.                                                                                                          -- Nolan Bushnell, the video-game pioneer who foundedAtari Corp., owns a lot of personal computers, but says he isstill a game freak at heart. His at-home roster of PCs isimpressive -- a Macintosh IIci from Apple Computer Inc., a&quot;no-name&quot; IBM clone for business applications, and an Amiga2500 from his new employer Commodore International, allloaded with options. But he says he spends much of his freetime playing &quot;virtually every video game known to man.&quot;   To feed this habit, Mr. Bushnell has assembled a largearray of video-game machines in his Woodside, Calif., home,ranging from the most common Nintendo Co. unit to moresophisticated &quot;16-bit&quot; devices from NEC Corp. and SegaEnterprises Ltd. He also keeps around an Atari 2600, adinosaur from the early days of the video-game craze, and haseven nabbed the Japanese version of the basic Nintendomachine so he can play a wider range of games.   He also enlists his full-fledged computers for playinggames like &quot;Lemmings&quot; and &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; for the Amiga, and&quot;Loops&quot; for the IBM clone. &quot;And I still find myself playingTetris {a simple but addictive Soviet game} on my Mac everynow and again,&quot; he adds.                                                                                                          NICHOLAS NEGROPONTE   Director,   MIT Media Laboratory                                                                                                          -- Nicholas Negroponte owns five Apple Macintoshcomputers. &quot;That's a relatively large number,&quot; heacknowledges. His 21-year-old son takes one to college.Another is in Mr. Negroponte's house on Patmos Island inGreece. A third is a Mac portable. And the other two are athome in Boston -- one upstairs in a guest bedroom and anotherdownstairs in a home office.   &quot;If I wake up at 3 or 4 in morning and think of something,I just move 20 feet away,&quot; says Mr. Negroponte, explainingthe value of having the PCs at home.   Mr. Negroponte, who as Media Lab director deals frequentlywith companies and researchers in Japan and Europe, uses hiscomputer 80% of the time for electronic mail. (He has a 9,600baud modem, though he uses it at 2,400 bauds.) &quot;Bydefinition, the subculture of people I deal with are one-mail,&quot; he says. &quot;If they want to communicate with me on aregular basis, they get on e-mail real fast. It'slocation-independent and computer-readable. You can takepieces, edit them and retransmit. I don't have a telephoneanswering machine. What a lot of people do with an answeringmachine, I do with electronic mail.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
