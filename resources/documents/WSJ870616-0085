A company spokesman said the St. Louis-based defense and aerospace company will spend $100 million to start production of its Atlas-Centaur launch vehicles. Alan M. Lovelace, general manager of the space systems division, told a gathering at the 1987 Paris Air Show that the company had &quot;several customers&quot; for launches beginning in 1989. A company spokesman said the customers include Eutelsat, a European telecommunications and satellite company that has reservations for two launches, but he declined to identify the other concerns.    General Dynamics becomes the third major U.S. company, along with McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp., to attempt to fill the void for space launch vehicles left by last year's Challenger disaster.    The move could prove risky for General Dynamics, the nation's largest defense contractor. Unlike McDonnell Douglas and Martin Marietta, it isn't producing rockets for the government and thus doesn't have a production base with which to attract commercial customers. And some industry analysts believe there isn't enough commercial demand to support three major competitors.    A McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman said General Dynamics' entry in the commercial field should pose significant competition only for certain types of launches. General Dynamics' rockets will be equipped to launch payloads of no more than 5,200 pounds. That is generally more than McDonnell Douglas's rockets are capable of launching, but much less than Martin Marietta's rockets can boost.    General Dynamics said a market analysis showed there were at least 50 satellites, most of which were scheduled for launch on the space shuttle, that meet the weight specifications of the Atlas-Centaur rocket. The Reagan administration last year banned all commercial launches from future shuttle flights after the explosion of the Challenger.    General Dynamics said it can launch most weather, telecommunications and military satellites for less than $60 million. McDonnell Douglas estimates its commercial launches will cost less than $50 million. The price tag for each Martin Marietta launch, which can carry two satellites, is expected to exceed $100 million.    So far, McDonnell Douglas has nine reservations for commercial launches, a company spokeswoman said. It also has a $669.3 million contract to build as many as 20 Delta rockets for launching U.S. Air Force navigational satellites.    As of March, Martin Marietta had a $2.2 billion backlog of government orders for its large Titan booster rockets and had signed preliminary agreements with eight commercial customers for 10 satellite launches.    General Dynamics said it would launch its satellites from Cape Canaveral, as the others do. </TEXT></DOC>
