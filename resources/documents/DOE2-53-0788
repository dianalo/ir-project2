It is suggested that a theory to explainthe high T(sub-c) should be coming soon if the spate of activity in theexperimental arena can be considered an indicator. It is noted that forthe new materials the energy gap, the characteristic phonon frequency,and the Fermi energy are comparable. This quantitative similarity isdistinctly different from previously known superconducting materials.</TEXT></DOC>
