VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis gave in to Jesse Jackson Saturday on changingDemocratic rules for 1992, but the Massachusetts governor stoodfirm on keeping the party's platform short and non-specific.   Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush savored a victory in Iowa,where his campaign had been sent into a spin by his third-placefinish in the caucuses back in February.   Jackson, campaigning in Puerto Rico on Saturday, hailed theproposed rules changes as ``a victory for the people ... a victoryfor democracy.''   If the rules changes, approved Saturday in Washington by theparty's Rules Committee, are adopted by the national conventionnext month, the number of ``super delegates'' to the 1992convention would be cut nearly in half. In addition, all stateswould be compelled to award delegates to presidential candidates inproportion to their support in the primaries and caucuses.   Jackson had complained that current provisions for superdelegates and the rules in a few state primaries and caucusesunfairly kept him from getting as many delegates as he should have.   The rules being changed were the very ones that Dukakis had usedto his advantage in clinching the Democratic presidentialnomination. But Tad Devine, the campaign's director of delegateselection who led the Dukakis negotiating team, said theMassachusetts governor would have won the nomination even if therules had been changed.   The Democrats' Platform Committee, meeting in Denver, waswinding up work on a statement of party principles that MichiganGov. James Blanchard, the committee chairman, said would be shortenough to print on a poster and mailed out. A 4,000-word draft ofthe document is one-tenth the size of the 1984 platform.   But unlike the Rules Committee, which convened to rubber-stampthe deals worked out in private negotiations between the Jacksonand Dukakis campaigns, proposals from the Jackson camp on taxes,defense, the Middle East and other issues were roundly rejected bythe Platform Committee.   The panel turned aside repeated efforts to amend the platformwith Jackson campaign planks as it approved a document of barely4,000 words _ one-tenth the size of its 1980 and 1984 platforms.   Nevertheless, the mood throughout the 11-hour meeting washarmonious.   The first Jackson amendment, calling for higher taxes and afreeze on Pentagon spending, was defeated 108-44.   Later, on voice votes, the Democrats rejected Jackson campaignproposals opposing first use of nuclear weapons by the UnitedStates, calling for ``self-determination for Israelis andPalestinians,'' and urging a doubling of the federal educationbudget.   Eleanor Holmes Norton, who heads Jackson's platform effort, saidhe told her by telephone that she should press the issues on whichthey were unable to agree ``in a spirit of collegiality and respectfor his opponent, Gov. Dukakis.''   One other issue the Democrats need to settle before theconvention is the selection of a keynote speaker, and TexasTreasurer Ann Richards said she is on the short list of candidatesbeing considered by Dukakis and party Chairman Paul Kirk.   ``I'm sure the fact that I have been a Democrat all my life andactive in the party, and the fact that I am the first female inTexas to hold public office statewide in 50 years'' played a part,she said.   An announcement of who will deliver the convention's keynoteaddress is expected this week.   Jackson spent Saturday in Puerto Rico, where he tried to pryloose some Dukakis delegates that he said should be his. Jacksonwon the state's non-binding primary, but Dukakis came away withalmost all the delegates, who were picked separately.   Dukakis was taking a breather in his schedule with a weekend onNantucket Island in Massachusetts. No public events were planned.   Bush spoke by telephone to state GOP convention delegates inIowa Saturday, saying ``the American people are going to see theclearest-cut choice in an election since the McGovern-Nixon race in1972.''   In the February caucuses, Bush finished behind Senate MinorityLeader Bob Dole of Kansas and television evangelist Pat Robertson.Bush recovered from the defeat with a victory in the New Hampshireprimary eight days later.   The vice president no longer has any opponents for the GOPpresidential nomination, and on Saturday he collected all 37 ofIowa's delegates to the national convention.</TEXT></DOC>
