SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SWINOUJSCIE, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East German claims to channel watersoff this lucrative Polish port have been fraying the ``frontier offriendship'' that separates the East bloc neighbors since 1985 butthe door now is open to a solution.   Poland and East Germany have signed an agreement to readjusttheir borders with the aim of settling once and for all a disputethat was given scant official public attention but became an opensecret on the piers of the Baltic coast.   Because of the dispute, both sides put border guards in place onthe wide beach west of the port and signs warned strollers. Markingbuoys were set out in the channel, which winds back and forth fromthe high seas to the port.   The port of Swinoujscie straddles the narrow opening of a baythat leads to Poland's largest port, Szczecin, 40 miles to thesouth on the Odra (Oder in German) River.   The conflict erupted after East Germany extended its territorialwaters to 12 miles from shore in 1985 and started to enforce itsclaim to parts of the channel approach to Swinoujscie that had beenunder Polish administration.   The agreement aimed at solving the frictions was signed May 22in East Berlin by the Polish and East German foreign ministers.   Essentially, East Germany agreed to abandon most of itsterritorial claims where they intersected the shipping lanes to andfrom the Polish port. In exchange, East Germany gets fishing rightsin part of the bay.   Only part of the westernmost approach to the bay will remainwaters of East Germany, which promises not to disturb Polish shiptraffic there.   ``The agreement is a common success for both states,'' said thechief Polish negotiator, Wladyslaw Napieraj, in an officialstatement.   A few years ago, East German coast guard cutters had closed inon ships that allegedly strayed out of Polish waters, warning themover bullhorns they were violating East German territory, saidJozef Chabowski, a department director at the Polish shippingcompany.   ``We were facing the problem that East Germany said we wereoperating on waters they claim don't belong to us, so the issuemust be settled. It was a show (of authority) from their side tothe ships,'' he said.   But he added that the incidents have been less frequent in thepast year.   The dispute arose at about the time Poland had made public plansto open a duty-free zone in Swinoujscie-Szczecin, while EastGermany was investing heavily to build up its Baltic port atRostock, 80 miles to the west.   Jozef Stebnicki of the maritime office that handles shippingcomplaints said recreational sailing craft had been affected, andBoleslaw Stolowicz, chairman of the Certa fish cooperative, said itwas a problem for deep-sea fishing companies.   Talks at the highest level on the dispute took place last Junewhen Poland's Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski met Erich Honecker, the EastGerman leader, in the former German city of Wroclaw. A governmentspokesman at that time said an agreement was near.   ``We here in the western territories of Poland are especiallysensitive to these problems because of the most recent history,''said Jerzy Timen, an editor at the Szczecin-based weekly newspaperMorze I Ziemia (Sea and Earth).   Timen, who has written extensively on the dispute, said Polishauthorities were not interested in heating up the conflict and thatofficials censored articles in his newspaper that tried to put theconflict in a national and international context.   ``Everyone was talking about it, but articles didn't appear _although you could sneak certain problems into professional orfactory publications,'' he said.   But Polish underground newspapers from the area reportedextensively on the dispute and said that Polish vessels at onepoint were being stopped and inspected by East Germans.   Just after World War II, the area around Swinoujscie-Szczecin,previously German, was turned over to Poland.   The German towns of Swinemuende and Stettin became Swinoujscieand Szczecin.   Resident Germans were forced to leave, while Polish refugeeswere moved in after having been expelled by the Soviet Union fromwhat before the war had been the eastern part of Poland.   As relations between Poland and East Germany improved in the1970s, Poles and East Germans only had to show national identitycards to cross the border. Poles flocked to East Germany to shop atits better stocked stores.   But after the rise of the independent Solidarity trade union in1980-81, East Germans required Poles to use passports and issuedPoles entrance visas only on the basis of an invitation.   Now the majority of Germans in the restaurants and on thebeaches are tourists from West Berlin, only a two-hour drive away,who benefit from the exchange rate that allows them, among otherthings, to eat a first-rate dinner for the equivalent of only about$10.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs May 29</NOTE></DOC>
