The Bush administration demanded that Iraq pull itssoldiers away from the northern Iraqi city of Zakhu so theywon't interfere with a U.S.-led effort to build refugee campsfor the Kurds in that area. Iraq said it would withdraw allits soldiers and leave a small police force.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush hailed the Iraqi announcement as&quot;encouraging.&quot; The move suggests that, in the short run, theU.S. and its allies will have an easier time setting upseveral massive refugee camps without risk of clashes withIraqi soldiers or Iraqi intimidation of Kurds trying to reachthe camps.   But it is less clear that a long-term solution to theKurds' problems will be found in the autonomy plan announcedby Kurdish leaders after talks with the Iraqi government.   Many Kurds doubt that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein willhonor his promises to let Kurds return home in peace and takegreater control of their affairs. They are asking that theU.S. or the United Nations provide guarantee that the worldcommunity will force Saddam Hussein to honor the agreement.Without such an assurance, many are reluctant to leave theirmountain encampments.   But U.S. officials said that while they are willing toconsider the Kurds' request for a guarantee, it would bedifficult to offer the kind of assurance Kurds seek.   The agreement in principle between Saddam Hussein andKurdish leaders is designed to implement an autonomy plannegotiated in 1970 but never put into effect. Details of theplan need to be worked out before a formal agreement issigned. But the pact nominally would give Kurds greaterpolitical freedom from Baghdad.   U.S. officials said the U.N. would be hesitant toguarantee that it will force Saddam Hussein to honor anypromises he makes in an autonomy agreement. To many membersof the U.N. Security Council, making such a promise wouldamount to &quot;trampling on Iraqi sovereignty,&quot; one senioradministration official said. An international pledge alsowould suggest U.N. willingness to intervene militarily if thepact breaks down, an idea China, in particular, would oppose.   Administration aides are considering other kinds ofpressures they might use to assure Kurds that Saddam Husseinwill keep his promises. In particular, the U.S. might tellKurds it will use its influence at the U.N. to keep economicsanctions clamped on Iraq if Saddam Hussein breaks hispromises.   In any event, President Bush will have a wrenching problemon his hands if Saddam Hussein uses the autonomy agreement tolure Kurds back home and then turns his army on them in a fewmonths in revenge for their recent insurrection against hisregime. By then, U.S. forces likely will be far away andunable to threaten Iraq.   Some Kurds fear that the new autonomy pact may be intendedprecisely to give Saddam Hussein breathing space untilinternational attention subsides.   &quot;He will be quiet in the short term,&quot; said Howar Ziad, amember of the Kurdish-American Congress. Later, Mr. Ziadadds, &quot;his main strategy will be to go for the Kurdishpolitical organization first to try to destroy it. He'll takehis retaliation on the Kurdish civilian population as he didbefore.&quot;   If the accord works, it might undermine theadministraton's long-term strategy toward Iraq. A successfulagreement that quiets Kurdish unrest would increase SaddamHussein's control of Iraq, thereby undercutting theadministration's goal of seeing him ousted from power.</TEXT></DOC>
