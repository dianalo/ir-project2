First Executive last year tried to sell its second-largestinsurance subsidiary, but the proposed buyer, a privateinvestor group, was unable to complete the purchase of theNew York-based unit. First Boston, which is owned by CS FirstBoston Inc., will examine alternatives for First Executive'sNew York subsidiary and other units, people familiar with thecompany said.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, a top official of Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., one ofFirst Executive's traditional investment bankers, said Kidderis representing another company &quot;that is interested in atransaction with First Executive.&quot;   Scott Newquist, an executive managing director at Kidderin charge of investment banking, declined to identifyKidder's client or specify the nature of its proposedtransaction.   However, speculation within the insurance industry hascentered on Kidder's parent, General Electric Co., which maybe interested in purchasing part of First Executive'sjunk-bond portfolio or one of its insurance units. Inparticular, GE could be interested in First Executive's NewYork-based unit.   Fred Carr, chairman of First Executive, confirmed in aninterview yesterday that First Executive had hired FirstBoston. He declined to specify First Boston's assignment.First Boston officials declined to comment.   One person familiar with First Executive said FirstBoston's assignment is &quot;to help the board and the managementunderstand what options the company might have in addition towhat it's doing now.&quot;   First Executive's move comes as the company, which hasassets of more than $19 billion, is under pressure on severalfronts. For the fourth quarter of last year, First Executivereported a stunning loss of $835.7 million, or $9.98 a share,after writing down the value of its $8 billion junk bondportfolio by $859 million. First Executive, which was a majorcustomer of now-failed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., isbelieved to hold the nation's largest portfolio ofhigh-yield, high-risk junk bonds and has been hurt by therecent swoon in the market for such bonds.   News of the write-down caused a surge in redemptions byholders of policies issued by First Executive's two mainunits, Executive Life Insurance Co. of California andExecutive Life Insurance Co. of New York. Policy surrendersand redemptions were $559 million in the first two months ofthis year, more than double the year-earlier rate. FirstExecutive has told securities analysts that the pace ofwithdrawals slowed in March and April, but hasn't providedspecific figures.   First Executive also could face problems from proposed newinsurance regulations that would force insurers to put upmore capital as a reserve against possible losses on the someof the lowest-rated junk bonds they hold. Executive Life isalso being closely examined by California insuranceregulators and First Executive's securities offering lastyear is being investigated by the Securities and ExchangeCommission.   As a result of these problems, First Executive's commonstock has tumbled from a price of about $17 a share withinthe last 12 months to close at $2.75 a share on Friday in thenational over-the-counter market.   One disgruntled major shareholder, Rosewood FinancialCorp., Dallas, which owns a 9.9% stake in First Executive,offered earlier this year to buy the company for cash andstock that it valued at $6 a share. First Executive rejectedthe offer as inadequate. Rosewood, an arm of the CarolineRose Hunt trust, hasn't renewed its offer.   Herbert E. Goodfriend, an insurance analyst withPrudential-Bache Securities, New York, views the hiring ofFirst Boston as a sign that First Executive will become moreaggressive in defending itself. &quot;We surmise that this newstep by the company will include possible recapitalizationand/or new money/new blood,&quot; Mr. Goodfriend wrote in a recentreport. Mr. Goodfriend declined to elaborate, citing aPrudential-Bache policy that bars him from discussing FirstExecutive with the press beyond his written reports. APrudential-Bache spokeswoman declined to explain the firm'sreason for barring Mr. Goodfriend from speaking about FirstExecutive.   Mr. Newquist of Kidder Peabody said his firm had discussedwith First Executive the possibility of evaluating FirstExecutive's portfolio. But, Mr. Newquist said, &quot;we feel we'reconflicted from working for First Executive because ofanother assignment we have.&quot; He said the assignment is from&quot;another company that is interested in a transaction withFirst Executive.&quot; He declined to identify the company or thenature of the transaction.   For First Boston, the hiring by First Executive representsthe fourth major insurance or junk-bond assignment in recentmonths. First Boston is trying to sell the insurance units ofAmBase Corp., New York; American General Corp., a Houstoninsurance and finance company; and the $3 billion junk bondportfolio of insolvent Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association,Beverly Hills, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
