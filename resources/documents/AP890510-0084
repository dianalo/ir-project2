Schools shut for the day, banks and public offices closed in themorning and newspapers didn't publish. City bus drivers struck fortwo hours.   Union rallies were held in major cities.   The unions urged 16 million workers to strike for up to fourhours to protest what they say is an unfair burden on workers andthe elderly.   The so-called ``ticket system'' went into effect April 1 andrequires the payment of small fees for hospitalization and medicaltests in state hospitals.   Premier Ciriaco De Mita denounced the strike, saying people areprepared to spend large amounts of money to attend soccer games ortake weekend vacations but not to pay the $7 daily fee required forhospitalization.   ``Whoever thinks that this strike is disproportionate in respectto the (fees) is making a mistake,'' social activist Giovanni Morotold a rally in Florence, where unions said 150,000 people turnedout. ``Above all, they don't understand that citizens of theworld's fifth industrial power don't want a Third World healthsystem.''   The strike was called by the communist-dominated GeneralFederation of Italian Labor, the mostly Christian DemocraticItalian Federation of Union Workers and the Socialist-led ItalianUnion of Workers.</TEXT></DOC>
