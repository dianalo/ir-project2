Coup jitters have been aggravated by the recent escape of rebelmilitary officers, including former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''Honasan, who tried to overthrow the government in August.   ``The prudence of this visit, at this time, after a recentincident, has been questioned,'' Mrs. Aquino said before leaving,in a reference to opposition calls to cancel the visit because ofHonasan's escape.   ``On the contrary, its cancellation would be the greatestfolly,'' she added. ``For our visit to China will show our greatneighbor that we have at least achieved the internal politicalstability and peace to play a responsible and important role thatis expected of us in Asian affairs.''   Mrs. Aquino said the visit would also provide an opportunity tomeet China's new leadership and renew ``our mutual principal ofnon-interference in each other's internal affairs.'' China stoppedsupporting communist rebels in the Philippines after Beijing andManila established full diplomatic relations in the mid-1970s.   Mrs. Aquino's last trip abroad was to Japan in November 1986.   On Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino assured her Cabinet that maximumsecurity measures had been taken to keep the country safe duringher absence, according to Presidential Press Secretary TeodoroBenigno. Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the 160,000-memberarmed forces would crush any attempted coup.   ``Nothing can happen that can topple the government in one fellswoop,'' said Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, Manila area militarycommander, on Wednesday.   However, he said both military renegades and communist rebelsfighting the government for almost 20 years could still bedangerous. ``Of course, these crazy guys running around out therecan commit some crazy things, like bombing some isolated facilityor even assassinating somebody.''   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, the country's most prominent clergyman,appealed for peace Wednesday. He said he was praying ``to keep allthe enemies of peace and democracy away from our beautiful land''during Mrs. Aquino's absence.   After Wednesday's Cabinet meeting, Ramos announced thenationwide troop alert and said it would remain in effect until thepresident returns Sunday.   He also said security had been doubled at a military prison nearManila to prevent further escapes by 157 military officers andenlisted men held in connection with the Aug. 28 coup attempt. Themost serious of several bids to overthrow Mrs. Aquino since shecame to power in February 1986, it left 53 people dead and morethan 300 wounded.   Honasan, the alleged mastermind of that coup, escaped with 14 ofhis prison guards April 2 from a ship where he had been held sincehis December arrest.   Three other soldiers held for previous coup attempts have alsoescaped in the past two weeks.   The military also said Wednesday that communist New People'sArmy guerrillas fired on one of its helicopters shortly after itlanded near Dumaguete, about 400 miles south of Manila on Negrosisland.   Two colonels and two sergeants were wounded in Tuesday's attack,the military said.</TEXT></DOC>
