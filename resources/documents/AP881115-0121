According to the department's Energy Information Administration,analysts have discovered major errors, namely significantoverstatements of natural gas use by American industry, behind theprevious projection.   Correction of the natural gas error means the nation's energyefficiency is actually improving, though more slowly than in thepast, the EIA said.   The agency's ``Short-Term Energy Outlook'' publication in in Julyprojected a worsening of the ratio from 19,960 BTUs per dollar ofgross national product in 1987 (expressed in dollars of 1982 buyingpower) to 20,180 in 1988, followed by a slight improvement to 20,050in 1989.   The October revision puts 1988 efficiency at 19,840 BTUs perdollar, a gain of 0.6 percent, with 1989 efficiency projected at19,590, a further gain of 1.3 percent.   Many analysts pay close attention to how much energy the economyuses to produce a dollar's worth of goods and services.Environmentalists use that ratio as an indicator of how much damagethe environment might be subject to from economic activity;policymakers take it as a gauge of the vulnerability of the economyto future interruptions on oil imports.   Last year was the first since 1976 the ratio had failed toimprove. Energy price increases of the late 1970s had set off aglobal scramble to boost efficiency, and, in the United States, ledto average annual rate of improvement of about 1.1 percent in the1970s and 2.8 percent in the period 1980-1986.   Oil prices, though, collapsed in 1986, leading many analysts toconclude that companies stopped looking so hard for ways to use lessenergy _ heat, electricity, petroleum or whatever _ in producingtheir products.   The EIA's October report said that 43 companies deliveringnatural gas to industrial users ``have consistently misreportedtheir monthly industrial'' deliveries following introduction of anew reporting form in January.   ``This resulted in an overstatement of industrial consumption inthe first six months of 1988 of 0.5 trillion cubic feet,'' about 16percent of now-estimated industrial consumption for the first halfof the year, the EIA said.   Natural gas accounts for 23 percent of all forms of energy use.</TEXT></DOC>
