The draft was completed after a tense dinner conversation Fridayin which West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his nation wouldnot seek claim to German-speaking areas outside the Germancountries.   Many Europeans fear the emergence of a united, more powerfulGermany. West Germany's mighty economy already dominates thecontinent.   Reunification now seems possible because of the dramatic changestaking place in East Germany. The nation has loosened travelrestrictions, opened the Berlin Wall, thrown out hard-lineCommunist leaders, and stripped the Communist Party of itsconstitutionally guaranteed hold on power.   French President Francois Mitterrand said at the two-daysummit's closing news conference today that reunification wasacceptable.   ``I am not afraid of reunification,'' he said. ``I consider itto be legitimate.''   But he also said that countries must adhere to internationaltreaties and other obligations ``unless they are prepared to createdangerous and unnecessary tensions.''   On Friday, the European leaders agreed to negotiations for asystem of central banks and eventually a single European currency.They approved a social charter on the rights of labor unions, wagesand welfare. Both were approved over strong opposition from Britain.   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France and severalother delegations initially rejected West German phrasing onreunification.   The crucial moment came at Friday night's dinner when DutchPrime Minister Ruud Lubbers and Italian Prime Minister GiulioAndreotti pressed Kohl for his definition of reunification.   Belgian and Dutch sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said Kohl made clear that in his view, reunification applied onlyto the two existing German nations and not to German-speaking areasin neighboring countries.   Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens described theconfrontation as ``the most tense moment of the summit.''   Mitterrand accepted Kohl's definition, and French diplomats wentto work on redrafting the declaration on Germany.   The draft declaration says reunification ``should take placedemocratically and peacefully, and on the basis of all theprinciples defined by the Helsinki Final Act, in a context ofdialogue and East-West cooperation.'' The 1975 Helsinki accords onEuropean cooperation and security fix post-war borders.   The leaders also said they must draw closer ``in this crucialperiod for Europe.''   ``It is in the interest of all European states that theCommunity should become stronger and accelerate its progress towardunion,'' the draft declaration said.   No formal votes were taken Friday, and only Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher of Britain objected during the closed-doordiscussions on the monetary conference and the social charter.   The decision to move toward economic and monetary union meansthe EC will convene a special conference in December 1990 to startnegotiations for the adoption of a single currency and a system ofcentral banks.   France and West Germany overrode objections by Mrs. Thatcherthat radical monetary integration will rob member countries ofsovereign rights to decide national economic policy.   Britain will attend the conference in what Thatcher aidesdescribed as a ``spirit of constructive argument.'' Mrs. Thatchersaid the non-binding ``social charter'' for the rights of laborunions would increase unemployment, raise costs and make EC goodsless competitive.</TEXT></DOC>
