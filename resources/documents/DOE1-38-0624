This paper presentsthe flight data of the two 50 A h NASA standard batteries that are beingflown on the ERBS. Trend characteristics of the batteries were collectedover a period of two years. The parameters that were followed are: thebattery end-of-discharge voltage, time in peak power track and time inconstant current mode. All were plotted versus mission elapsed time.The slopes exhibited by the parameters indicate no adverse trends thatwould signify any appreciable degradation in the batteries.</TEXT></DOC>
