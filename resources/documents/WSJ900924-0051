The message they delivered in meetings with two commissionvice presidents was blunt: The EC electronics industry islosing ground in world markets, &quot;and we don't see anypositive reaction by the commission&quot; to help, recalls PeterAsam, director of external relations for West Germanelectronics giant Siemens AG, who attended the meetings.</LP><TEXT>   The message got through. Now, the EC's executive agency isconducting the most sweeping review of itselectronics-industry policies in a decade. It will helpdetermine whether the $200 billion European electronicsindustry pulls out of its tailspin. It also will influencethe political reception U.S. and Japanese electronicscompanies get here in the early 1990s.   The review will take months, but a few clear policies arealready gaining ascendancy in Brussels, according to ECCommission officials and industry lobbyists.   Chief among them is a desire for closer ties to the U.S.,formerly considered as much a threat to the EC electronicsindustry as Japan. A U.S.-EC alliance, commission officialsargue, could help both regions compete with an increasinglystrong Japanese electronics industry. &quot;The political climateis favorable for cooperation between the {U.S.} and the EC,&quot;says Michel Carpentier, EC director-general forelectronics-related programs. EC officials hope to agree thisyear on some form of collaboration with Washington -- thoughthe U.S. is undecided on the issue.   Other proposals gaining ground in Brussels are measures tostimulate European demand for electronics products. Onepossibility involves a massive public works project to linkgovernment computers of all 12 EC member states. The project,dubbed the European Nervous System, would be the largestelectronics procurement in European history. The ECCommission already has allocated 380 million EuropeanCurrency Units ($504 million) to research such a network. Butnow Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC vice president in chargeof science and technology, says he also wants the commissionto help supervise the network's installation.   A third proposal, overt protectionism, is so far beingrejected in Brussels. Despite industry calls for help, &quot;itwould be an enormous mistake to go to more protectionism,&quot;says Mr. Pandolfi. Indeed, the EC Commission is consideringproposals to cut import duties on all semiconductors to 9.2%from 14%, and to eliminate the 5% import duty on computers.   The source of all this policy foment is the sad state ofEuropean electronics. After hitting a peak European marketshare of 43% in 1987, Europe's computer companies are nowlosing sales and profits to U.S. and Japanese rivals; thisyear, industry pundits expect European manufacturers' shareto fall to 37%. (Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. yesterday announcedplans to cut several thousand jobs as it grapples with theslowdown in demand in the computer industry and the weakdollar.)   The semiconductor industry is shrinking as weak playerscut back; last year, the European industry held just 36.5% ofthe European chip market, down from 43.3% in 1979. Partlybecause of European phone deregulation, the once-strong ECtelecommunications equipment industry is losing ground. Andthe EC's overall electronics trade balance is dismal: Lastyear, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, a Geneva-based United Nations agency, the EC'selectronics trade deficit hit a record $27.22 billion.   Now, Mr. Carpentier says, &quot;We ask ourselves: What might bedone?&quot;   For starters, he and other EC officials say, the answersinclude altering some long-cherished European principles.Through much of the 1980s, the EC Commission and several ECmember states pursued a policy of Europe for Europeans inelectronics. U.S. and Japanese companies, which control morethan half of the EC's computer and semiconductor markets,were the challenge against which EC industry had to rally.The commission pumped about 3 billion ECUs into electronicsresearch programs with catchy names like Esprit and Race.Though U.S. and Japanese companies weren't entirely excluded,they weren't always welcome. The aim was to get EC companiesworking together, pooling their strengths.   Now, however, officials in Brussels and at several ECcapitals are encouraging U.S.-EC collaboration. &quot;We are verymuch in favor of a trans-Atlantic partnership,&quot; says KlausRupf, director of information technology in Bonn's Ministryof Research and Technology. &quot;In some areas, I doubt whetherwe will be able to solve the strategic challenge of Japan onour own.&quot;   Signs of this policy switch are numerous. Earlier thisyear, politicians in Bonn and Brussels applauded a Siemensagreement to collaborate with International Business MachinesCorp. in a crucial area of semiconductor technology,developing 64-megabit dynamic random access memory chips.Likewise, talks are under way to link the largest Europeanand U.S. government semiconductor-research programs, Jessiand Sematech. In high-definition television, thenext-generation TV technology under study world-wide, ECcompanies are being urged to seek alliances with U.S.companies. And the EC Commission wants to sign a memorandumof understanding soon with the U.S., spelling out other areasfor electronics collaboration.   But just how far this romance goes depends largely onWashington -- which can't seem to make up its mind.   President George Bush's science adviser and the U.S.National Science Foundation have expressed enthusiasm forcloser EC ties. But the U.S. trade representative andCommerce Department officials are leery of any agreementswith Brussels that might violate Washington's official tabooagainst telling U.S. companies how to run their overseasbusinesses.   Another cherished EC policy that's under review is thelongstanding belief that European manufacturers need helpbolstering their technology. In the 1980s, the big ECresearch programs provided 50% subsidies for companies tocollaborate on &quot;pre-competitive&quot; research into basicsemiconductor, computer and telecommunications technologies.Now, however, EC officials say improving the supply ofEuropean electronics products isn't enough; market demand forthem must also rise. To whet the appetites of corporateelectronics buyers, they say, they now want to involve themwith electronics suppliers in more EC research programs.   More important and controversial, though, is a Brusselsplan that would put the commission in the driver's seat ofthe so-called European Nervous System. The project was pushedby industry lobbyists last year as part of the 1992 programfor lowering internal trade barriers. If the unified marketis to work, Brussels bureaucrats agreed, the EC members needto link their customs, police, treasury, air-traffic andother computers. The five-year budget awarded to the projectin April is for research on the concept only.   But Mr. Pandolfi, the EC technology commissioner, says &quot;itisn't enough to promote Randamp;D&quot; on the computer network. He says&quot;a direct, concerted action of the commission&quot; to establishthe network is needed to get it working -- and to help theEuropean electronics industry, which would be its mainsupplier. The commission, he says, must also &quot;coordinate theimplementation&quot; of the network. In practical terms, ECofficials say, that could mean helping specify the network'stechnical details, providing poorer EC states withregional-aid funds to buy the needed computer gear andcoordinating the network's installation and operation.   The proposal, which Mr. Pandolfi and EC Internal-MarketCommissioner Martin Bangemann plan to submit to the Councilof Ministers by the end of the year, will stir a politicaltempest. Mr. Pandolfi insists the project won't entail anyprotectionism or &quot;dirigisme,&quot; a French term for governmentdictating to industry. But British and Spanish officials havealready begun grumbling that the idea looks suspiciously likea power-grab by Brussels. Traditionally, public procurementhas been the exclusive province of national governments.   But the European electronics industry's backing for Mr.Pandolfi's proposal is overwhelming. &quot;Today, cooperativeresearch in EC programs isn't enough,&quot; argues BrunoLamborghini, president of Eurobit, the main European computertrade association, and vice president for strategy at Italiancomputer-maker Olivetti. &quot;We need something that can create alarger critical mass&quot; in European electronics, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
