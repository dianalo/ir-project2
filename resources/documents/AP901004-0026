The dollar finished the day at 135.90 yen, down 0.75 yen fromWednesday's close. Trading ranged between 135.65 yen and 135.98yen, after opening at 135.88 yen. It was the lowest opening ratefor the U.S. currency in 14 months.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Averagefell 571.20 points, or 2.56 percent, to 22,278.19 points. It hadshed 49.04 points on Wednesday after a record surge the previousday.   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark 10-year governmentbond fell to 8.290 percent , down from 8.310 percent on Wednesday.The price rose to 82.40 yen, up from 82.32 yen on Wednesday.   Currency traders said the dollar weakened after U.S. FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that the proposedU.S. budget would ``almost certainly'' depress interest rates.   Greenspan told a Congressional committee that failure to approvethe budget's $500 billion deficit-reduction package would be a``grave mistake'' with serious consequences for an already weakenedU.S. economy.   The market seems to have reached a floor at 135 yen to thedollar, however, said Hiroyuki Yamaguchi at Commerz Bank A.G.``There seems to be a lot of buying orders at 135, I think maybe wewill not see 134 for the rest of this week,'' he said.   The recovery on the stock market, short-covering and pessimismabout lower interest rates in the United States are moving thedollar-yen exchange, said Masato Hayashi, chief customer dealer forthe Bank of Tokyo.   ``Every morning we see a much lower level. So every day, atfirst, people try to sell. Then there are more buyers, until thedollar reaches the high from outside (markets). Then the dollarfalls again,'' he said.   The dollar probably already has hit its high for the day, hesaid.   Stock traders cited higher oil prices and an overnight fall onthe New York stock market as reasons for the falling Nikkeiaverage.   ``Basically, I think what we are seeing is a fair amount ofprofit taking,'' said Steve Usher of Kleinwort BensonInternational, Inc. Tuesday's record surge left people``confused,'' but the basic sentiment is still depressed because ofpoor fundamentals and uncertainty in the externals, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
