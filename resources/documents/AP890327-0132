Details of the incident remained sketchy in the face ofgovernment denials, and sources could not confirm whether the yachtand its passengers were still in Iranian hands.   But Iranian diplomats in the southern gulf port of Dubai werediscreetly spreading word that the yacht would not be held, said adiplomatic source in Dubai who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Earlier reports said the ship was seized Thursday near theRevolutionary Guard stronghold of Farsi Island, with five membersof Kuwait's ruling Sabah family and four young British women onboard. One report said they were airline stewardesses. There was noconfirmation Monday of who was on board.   ``This seems to be nothing more than the usual practice of theIranian Revolutionary Guards,'' said a Kuwait-based diplomat,speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There does not appear to beanything political behind this incident, it just seems to be anexercise in piracy.''   The guards, using speedboats with guns mounted on board, roamedthe gulf shipping lanes and attacked vessels during the eight-yearIran-Iraq war, which was halted in August by a cease-fire.   ``A ranking Iranian diplomat has confirmed that the yacht wasseized when it strayed in Iranian waters,'' said the diplomaticsource in Dubai. He also said the Iranian confirmed an imminentrelease.   The sources said Iran did not want to jeopardize the friendlyties it has been developing with Kuwait since the cease-fire, andthat the affair would end quietly. Iran has not commented publiclyon the reports.   The diplomats said the occupants of the yacht may have beenreleased by Monday, but that sandstorms and rough seas were keepingthe ship in Iranian waters.   Kuwait's government apparently leaked the story to the respecteddaily newspaper Al-Anbaa to pressure Iran for a release. Thenewspaper first reported details of the seizure on Sunday.   The governments of Kuwait, Bahrain and Britain denied allreports involving the incident.   The diplomats speculated that the identity of the passengerswould never be released, especially if members of the royal familywere involved. The 82-foot yacht's name, the Falaika, is the sameas a resort island off Kuwait and indicated that it came from thewealthy emirate.   If Britons were on board, they might not have been missedbecause they did not bother to register with the local embassy, thediplomats said.   ``By the time everything has firmed up, it will probably bereferred to as a case of a small motorboat getting lost andreleased, with no one of significance aboard,'' said one source.</TEXT></DOC>
