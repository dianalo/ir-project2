A highly placed oil official in the kingdom disclosed thatoutput is being restored to near the prewar level becausemore tankers are entering the Persian Gulf than had beenexpected.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Today, we are carrying on our normal business,&quot; he said.Production is back up to 8.3 million barrels a day, he added.   That is still slightly less than the 8.6 million barrels aday Saudi Arabia was producing earlier this year as itcontinued to pump flat out to offset the loss to worldmarkets of oil from Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. But it isone million barrels a day higher than the output of 7.3million barrels a day at the weekend just after war brokeout.   &quot;We were ultraconservative and underestimated the numberof ships coming in,&quot; said the official, speaking for SaudiArabian Oil Co. As a result of anticipating a major lull intanker traffic, he said, the kingdom began reducingproduction immediately after the Persian Gulf war broke outlast week.   Also, he noted that most of the cutbacks were in the lessdesirable heavier crudes produced in the northern offshorefields nearest the war zone.   Petroleum prices rebounded yesterday, nevertheless, due inpart to the weekend reports that Saudi oil production hadbeen sharply reduced because of market conditions. Atyesterday's close of trading on the New York MercantileExchange, crude oil for February delivery settled at $21.30,up $2.05 a barrel.   The oil price rise came after two days of declines lastweek -- $10 a barrel on Thursday alone -- that shocked theworldwide trading community.   Yesterday, oil traders were reacting to the reports thatthe Saudis, unable to sell all of the crude they had beenproducing, had cut their output. The traders had expected thecuts to be large enough to offset the anticipated releases oftwo million barrels a day of government stockpiles by theInternational Energy Agency.   These drawdowns, of which one-half will come from the U.S.Strategic Petroleum Reserve, were announced in response toperceived shortages from the war. But unless there arefurther disruptions from the war, they will be pouring moreoil into glutted markets.   Indications late yesterday that Saudi production hadalready turned around and was again climbing didn't spark adecline in prices, as might have been expected.   &quot;We're all still shellshocked,&quot; said Andrew Lebow, analystfor E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc.   Instead, many oil-market participants began to try to cometo grips with the realization that war in the Persian Gulfisn't likely to be short-lived. &quot;There's a lot more realityin the market now than last week,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, headof international trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers inLondon. &quot;It's become obvious that the action is going to lastfor more than a few days. Saddam has only shot off a fewmissiles; maybe he hasn't really attacked yet.&quot;   Even though prices are sharply lower since the air strikesbegan against Iraq, fear of disruptions in oil suppliescaused by the war is still a part of the pricing structure.According to Tom Burns, director of international economicsat Chevron Corp., oil prices should be as low as $15 abarrel, based on the abundance of supply and the decline indemand. &quot;There's inventory backed up into the water,&quot; Mr.Burns said.   The Iraqi missile attacks on Saudi Arabia Sunday added tothe oil-market nervousness. Even though nine of 10 Scudmissiles were destroyed by U.S. Patriot antimissile defenses,the attack brought home to market participants the fact thatIraq's missiles, even though inaccurate, still could reachcritical Saudi oil facilities.   &quot;While we are waiting for his {Saddam Hussein's}missiles,&quot; said a Saudi petroleum ministry official inRiyadh, with more than a touch of bravado, &quot;we are deliveringmore oil.&quot;   So far, he noted, Saddam Hussein's forces have been ableto hit only one oil storage tank in Saudi Arabia, aspreviously reported. &quot;It was only one-third full,&quot; he said.   A Saudi oil official confirmed production from threenorthern offshore fields, the Safaniyah, Marjan and Zuluf,was affected by the brief output cuts. &quot;The closings wereshort-lived,&quot; he said. All the offshore facilities still arebeing manned, he added.   But the Saudi oil official didn't rule out furtherclosings of the fields if required for defensive purposes.&quot;If the military sees a danger of our keeping the flares on{from burning natural gas}, they will ask us to shut down,&quot;he said.   The official said the kingdom wants to keep the fieldsopen &quot;because we are in a war&quot; and the oil may be needed.Still, he said, another closing of the fields shouldn't causeany problems for the oil market. &quot;It is comfortablysupplied,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
