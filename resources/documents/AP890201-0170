(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A contractor doing preliminary repair workon a highway bridge discovered an 18-inch hole in the deckWednesday, forcing state transportation officials to close two ofthree lanes while emergency repairs were made.   ``You can see all the way through the deck,'' said William Keish,a state Department of Transportation spokesman.   The Interstate 95 bridge over the Rippowam River in Stamford andis three miles from the Mianus River bridge in Greenwich, whichcollapsed in June 1983, killing three people.   Keish said the Rippowam River bridge was sound and the 18-inchhole posed no danger to motorists.   The bridge lanes closed around 9 a.m., and was to reopen with anemergency patch in place by the afternoon rush hour, Keish said. Thediscovery did not affect morning rush hour, but by 1 p.m., trafficwas backed up three to four miles, state police said.   The repairs involved ripping up a 4-by-6 foot patch of pavementand replacing it with a quick-drying patch, Keish said. The entirebridge deck is to be replaced as part of work to be completed byJune 1991, he said.   Collapse of the Mianus River bridge in 1983 prompted the state tobegin a multibillion-dollar, 10-year road and bridge repair program.A Superior Court jury decided three years ago that inadequatemaintenance led to the bridge collapse.   Keish said there was no comparison between the two bridgeproblems.   ``You had a 100-foot section fall out of a bridge, completelydisappear,'' he said of the Mianus River bridge. ``Here you've gotan 18-inch hole. Our major concern was the traffic, not the hole.''</TEXT></DOC>
