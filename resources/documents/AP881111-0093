Parliament President Philipp Jenninger's speech also called theearly years of the Nazi's Third Reich a ``triumphal procession.''   In his resignation statement, Jenninger, who also condemned theNazi pogram in his address Thursday, said he was misunderstood.   Nevertheless, his speech was criticized throughout the countryand abroad.   ``This event shows us how the darkest chapter of German historyis still a present-day thing,'' Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of theopposition Social Democratic Party, said after Jenninger'sresignation.   ``We must now work even harder with others to learn how to liveand worthily deal with this challenge,'' Vogel told reporters.   The leftist Greens Party said in a statement: ``The background ofwhat happened is the inability of many Germans to stand up to theirown past. We hope ... a discussion about guilt and responsibilityfor this recent history will take place.''   The furor overshadowed West Germany's carefully organizedceremonies marking Kristallnacht, the night of terror against theJews that signaled the start of the Holocaust.   Communist East Germany's official news agency ADN called theJenninger speech ``a scandal.'' Israel's Foreign Ministry called theincident ``unacceptable and unfortunate.''   ``It's a scandal, it's a shame,'' said Frankfurt Jewish communityspokesman Michel Friedman, a member of Jenniger's party, theChristian Democrats.   Jenniger said he was misunderstood. ``My speech was notunderstood by many listeners the way I had intended it to be,'' the56-year-old politician said in a written statement announcing hisresignation. ``I am deeply sorry and I am very hurt, if I haveoffended the feelings of others.''   His speech, at a special session of the Bundestag, or parliament,caused a walkout by about 50 lawmakers and calls for his resignation.   He added: ``During my whole political career _ most recently aspresident of the German Parliament _ I have been active in workingfor reconciliation with the Jews and for the vital interests of thestate of Israel.''   Jenninger said he was stepping down as Bundestag presidentbecause he wanted to avoid damage to the office and because hebelieved he lost the trust of many colleagues.   Jenninger had been the No. 2 West German official after PresidentRichard von Weizsaecker, under the nation's rules of diplomaticprotocal.   A member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats,Jenninger has been a lawmaker since 1969 and was one of Kohl'sclosest aides before he was elected Bundestag president in November1984.   In his speech Thursday, Jenninger talked at length about thepositive feelings of many ordinary Germans early in the Hitlerdictatorship.   ``Didn't Hitler bring to reality what (Kaiser) Wilhelm II hadonly promised, that is to lead the Germans to glorious times? Wasn'the chosen by Providence, a Fuehrer such as is given to a people onlyonce in a thousand years?'' Jenninger asked.   ``For the fate of the Germans and European Jews, Hitler'ssuccesses were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes andmisdeeds,'' Jenninger said.   ``The years from 1933 to 1938, even from a distant retrospectiveand in the knowledge of what followed, still are a fascinating thingtoday, since throughout history there was hardly a parallel toHitler's triumphant procession during the first years.''   Some listeners sobbed when Jenninger read an eyewitness accountof the murder of concentration camp victims in 1942.   ``Blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone,'' heread. ``Some of those shot were still moving, some lifted their armsand turned their heads, to show they were still alive.''   Social Democratic chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel said in a letter toJenninger that the Parliament president showed a ``disturbing lackof judgment.''   World Jewish Congress President Edgar M. Bronfman calledJenninger's remarks ``reprehensible.''   But a leader of West Germany's Jewish community defendedJenninger's speech, saying he could not understand calls for hisresignation.   ``I welcome that the parliament president described in fullclarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938,'' saidMichael Fuerst, a deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews inWest Germany.   Starting with the Kristallnacht of Nov. 9-10, 1938, the Nazismade clear their intentions to wipe out European Jews. On thatnight, Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues,sending 30,000 Jews to concentration camps and killing 91 Jews.   Shattered glass covered the streets and the Nazis, mockingly,named it Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night. The Nazis killed 6 millionJews and many others during Hitler's rule from 1933 to 1945.</TEXT></DOC>
