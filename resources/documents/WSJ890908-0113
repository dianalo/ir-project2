Although the 90-minute show will not go off the air, an executive from CBS Entertainment said it needs to be repositioned to compete for a young urban audience, one attracted to &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show,&quot; syndicated by Paramount Television, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc.    The late night program market -- shows that begin at 11:30 p.m. EDT -- has become increasingly competitive and lucrative for the three networks, which last year earned a combined $429 million in advertising revenues from such programs. NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., led the pack with its &quot;Tonight Show With Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;Late Night With David Letterman,&quot; with $264 million in revenues. CBS followed with $104 million. ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., only produces the 30-minute &quot;Nightline&quot; and had about $61 million.    The Sajak show, which has been criticized as a clone of NBC's &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, was hit hardest by the success of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, which is sold directly to TV stations, primarily independents. That show has attracted the 18-to-49-year-old audience, which, according to figures by A.C. Nielsen Co., is 47% larger for Arsenio Hall than it is for Sajak.    &quot;Arsenio changed the late night landscape,&quot; said Rod Perth, who was named vice president of late night programming for CBS Entertainment in August.    Mr. Perth said in an interview the show will begin to feature a spate of unknown comedians. &quot;This is going to be the show where up-and-coming comedians will establish themselves,&quot; Mr. Perth said. Another option under consideration is reducing Mr. Sajak's show to an hour. Mr. Perth declined to comment specifically about the show's length.    Last week, Mr. Perth delivered a closed-circuit address to CBS affiliates about Mr. Sajak's show, and the ratings performance is expected to be a major topic when the CBS affiliate board meets Sept. 18 in Washington, D.C. CBS said it remains committed to the show, which premiered last January and is the network's first serious attempt to be competitive late at night in years. Mr. Sajak has a two-year contract with CBS.    Since January, the show received a 3.1 rating/13 share, compared with a 3.7 rating/14 share for the same period in 1988 when the network aired movies and series at 11:30 p.m. For the key demographic area of men 25-54 years old, the ratings are off 26%. (A ratings point represents 904,000 TV households; shares are the percentage of sets in use.)    &quot;It's not doing as well as expected,&quot; said Paul Isacsson, executive vice president of the advertising agency Young andamp; Rubicam. &quot;CBS had promised advertisers a 5 rating. It's fallen short.&quot;    Mr. Perth said Mr. Sajak's show is profitable, but declined to be specific. &quot;The show has to start relating more to audiences in big cities, and not just to those in rural areas,&quot; he said. &quot;The list of guests also has to improve. All we trot out now are television stars and movie stars plugging their latest projects.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
