Only relatively recentlyhave newer generation full-body scanners been installed at major traumacenters, but experience is rapidly being gained in the utilization ofCT for abdominal trauma. CT has proved highly accurate in diagnosinga wide variety of injuries to both intra- and retroperitoneal organsin pediatric and adult patient populations.
