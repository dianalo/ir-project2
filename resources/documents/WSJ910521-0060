It will be GE's first nuclear power contract since themid-1970s. GE said its GE Nuclear Energy unit will supply thereactors, nuclear fuel, and turbine generators for two units.It said the contract is valued at more than $1 billion spreadover six years.</LP><TEXT>   The Japanese go-ahead is a tremendous boost for anindustry that first experienced a sudden fall of demand inthe mid-1970s and then became plagued by public concerns ofnuclear safety. According to GE, the industry hasn't receiveda new order that has resulted in a nuclear plant in the U.S.since the early 1970s. The only other nuclear plant GE hasbeen constructing is a two-unit facility in Mexico; the firstunit became operational in August 1990.   The nuclear power project for Tokyo Electric Power Co. hasbeen in the design and development stage for the last 10years. GE said it last week received an &quot;establishmentpermit&quot; from Japan's Ministry of International Trade andamp;Industry to install the first advanced boiling water reactorat the utility's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station,northwest of Tokyo.   GE will be joined in the venture by Hitachi Ltd. andToshiba Corp. The Japanese companies will supply suchcomponents as valves, condensers, and water pumps.   The first unit of the plant is scheduled for commercialoperation in July 1996, and the second a year later.   GE said the permit &quot;culminates a successful safety review&quot;of the advanced boiling water reactor, or ABWR, design byJapan's Atomic Energy Commission and Nuclear SafetyCommission. &quot;Included were extensive safety analyses andpublic hearings that confirmed the safety of the ABWR,&quot; GEsaid.   The 1,356,000-kilowatt ABWR plant to be installed is thenext generation of boiling water reactor. The reactor, whichhas been under development for 10 years, has a simpler designthan the earlier generation of plants, the GE spokesman said.As a result, the ABWR is cheaper to construct and operatethan previous generations of boiling water plants.   Besides making the cost and time for constructing anuclear plant more predictable in the future, the new design&quot;will allow plants to be constructed in much shorter timethan in the past,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;In the past, it hastaken as many as 14 years to build a nuclear plant.&quot;   Japan has been one of the most aggressive countries inadopting nuclear energy, because its indigenous sources ofenergy are limited. Nuclear power accounts for about 28% ofits electricity, according to GE. &quot;Japan's goal is togenerate more than 40% of its electric power from nuclearenergy by the end of the next decade,&quot; GE said.</TEXT></DOC>
