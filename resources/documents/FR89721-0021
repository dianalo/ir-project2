No. 87-687,52 FR 25870 (July 9, 1987) (``Corporate Governance''), the Board requestedcomments as to whether its regulations on branch and agency offices shouldbe revised in light of the Board's policy statement on branching whichencourages Federal institutions to provide ``choices of facilities forimproved financial services to the public.'' 12 CFR 556.5(a)(1) (1988).Seven commenters addressed the issue of agency offices. The commentersnoted that agency offices (also referred to as loan production offices)can provide more efficient and effective support for activities in whichfederal institutions are currently engaged if federal institutions arepermitted to establish agency offices in any state.The Board believes that permitting federal institutions to establish agencyoffices on a nationwide basis without regard to the location of the homeoffice or branch office(s) would result in a number of benefits as follows:(1) Increase the efficiency of a federal institution by reducing loan originationcosts;(2) Benefit consumers by permitting federal institutions to offer mortgagesand other loans at lower costs, without reducing present profit margins;(3) Increase the competitiveness of federal institutions; and(4) Permit federal institutions to become equivalent with national banksin the nationwide lending arena.This change should, in the Board's view, afford federal institutions theflexibility required to effectively and efficiently service and managetheir multi-state operations. Nationwide lending can only realize its potentialbenefits to lenders and consumers alike if lenders are permitted to moveappropriate operations closer to their customers. Expanding the agencyoffices on a nationwide basis would enhance the competitiveness and businessflexibility of federal institutions, while bringing a number of potentialbenefits to consumers. The change would in no way diminish an institution'sobligation to help meet the credit needs of its local community under theCommunity Reinvestment Act.At the present time, a federal institution has the option to open a secondtier service corporation that services and originates mortgage loans. Presentregulations require that agency offices in states other than where an institutionhas a home or branch office must be operated through the service corporationof a federal institution because of the geographical limitations on thelocations of agency offices. The Board does not believe that limiting agencyoffices to the state or states in which institutions have ``brick-and-mortar''branches is necessary or in the best interest of the industry. To requireinstitutions to establish loan production offices through the use of asecond tier service corporation in states where the institution has nobranch is costly. It denies the institution the opportunity to originatemortgage loans on uniform instruments which contain uniform provisionswhich are in full and complete compliance with the regulations of the Board.Federal institutions should be able to operate an agency office directlyrather than through its second tier service corporation. The use of theservice corporation requires additional legal, administrative, and licensingexpenses which would not otherwise be required. Origination of mortgagesthrough a second tier service corporation increases costs and is generallyless efficient than through loan production offices.Because a federal institution's second tier service corporation alreadymay engage in nationwide lending, the proposed change would not directlyrepresent an increase in the powers of federal institutions. Instead ofoperating the loan production office through a service corporation, theloan production office would be operated as an agency office of the federalinstitution and would be monitored routinely by the supervisory and examinationstaff. Loan records and documentation would continue to be kept in theinstitution's decision center for examination review.The Board's present policy puts federal institutions at a competitive disadvantagewith commercial banks who are able to establish loan production or agencyoffices anywhere in the United States. The Board's agency office regulationis more restrictive than comparable provisions applicable to other depositoryinstitutions. Present federal laws and regulations permit national banks,state institutions and state banks, to establish loan production officesin states in which they are not permitted to branch. 12 CFR 7.7380 delineatesthe national bank's regulation regarding loans originated at other thanbanking offices. Specifically, it states ``Origination of loans by employeesor agents of a national bank or of a subsidiary corporation at locationsother than the main office or a branch office of the bank does not violate12 U.S.C. 36 and 81; Provided, That the loans are approved and made atthe main office or a branch office of the bank or at an office of the subsidiarylocated on the premises of, or contiguous to, the main office or branchoffice of the bank.'' The regulation gives no limitation based on statelines. The Board's proposed action thus would not allow federal institutionsto penetrate new markets but allow them to operate more efficiently andto compete more effectively in existing markets. The proposal would allowfederal institutions to become equivalent with other depository institutionsin the nationwide-lending arena.The Board welcomes comments on this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to Section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis.1. <T3>Reasons, objectives and legal basis underlying the proposed rule.</T3>These elements are incorporated in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> regarding the proposal.2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule would apply.</T3> The proposedrule would apply to all insured institutions.3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities.</T3> The proposed rulewould not have a significant economic impact on small institutions.
