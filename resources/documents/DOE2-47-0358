<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-0358 </DOCNO><TEXT>At Eindhoven University of Technology a composite metal-ceramic materialis being developed. It will serve as a protective confinement for a combustionheated Thermionic Energy Converter, (TEC). This protective confinementor ''hot shell'' consists of a composite W-TiN-SiC layer structure. Theouter coating of SiC is to protect the TEC against the high temperature(1700/sup 0/C) combustion atmosphere. The inner layer of tungsten servesas an emitter for the TEC. The intermediate TiN layer functions as adiffusion barrier preventing the tungsten from reacting with the SiC.The composite material is vacuum tight and thermal fatigue resistant.The CVD-SiC can give adequate corrosion resistance while the tungstenis Cs-resistant and is a good thermionic emitter.</TEXT></DOC>
