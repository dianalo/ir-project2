The Department of Trade and Industry said in a provisional report Friday that Britain's current account, which measures trade in goods and services and certain unilateral transfers, swung to a surplus equivalent to $293 million in March from a deficit of $805.2 million the year before. The surplus also narrowed from $629.4 million in February. In the first quarter, the current account was in surplus by $1.05 billion, down from $1.14 billion the year before.    The figures were better than expected, but they split economists in the City, London's financial district. Some argued that Britain has entered a recovery period in which industry not only is increasing its share of exports but also is reclaiming domestic-market share previously lost to imports.    However, other analysts said the first-quarter figures are just a temporary phenomenon. Reduced taxes, lower interest rates and sterling's recent rise will revive imports and push the current account back into deficit this year, these analysts said.    Historically, Britain pays more attention to trade and current-account statistics than most other countries. Indeed, the opposition Labor Party has tried to make political capital out of the nation's slide into deficit last year after seven years of surplus.    But government officials refuse to draw long-term conclusions from the latest statistics. &quot;The prophets of doom and the optimists will both be ill served if they conclude too much from the March figures. It's just too early to say what really is happening&quot; this year, a Trade and Industry Department official said.    Even so, economic analysts said news of the current-account surplus, coupled with sterling's recent strength, means the Bank of England likely will permit a further half-point cut in Britain's base rate, to 9% from the 9.5% set last week. The cut in the rate -- the benchmark for commercial bank lending in Britain -- would likely come between Britain's local elections Thursday and general elections, which are widely expected in mid-June, the analysts said.    According to Friday's figures, Britain's merchandise trade was in deficit by a seasonally adjusted $711.5 million in March, wider than the $375 million deficit in February but narrower than the $1.63 billion deficit in March 1986.    The latest figures for imports and exports are more confused than usual because especially harsh winter weather in January had a distorting effect. Merchandise exports fell 7.5% in March from February, to $10.71 billion, while imports declined 4.5%, to $11.42 billion.    But between 1986's fourth quarter and the first quarter this year, Britain's merchandise-trade record improved, with the quarterly deficit narrowing to $2.01 billion from $4.35 billion.    Peter Spencer, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., said the trade numbers' real significance lies in a &quot;dramatic&quot; decline in import volume during the past six months. He said the effective devaluation of sterling last year has made British industry more competitive both at home and abroad. He predicts the current account could end 1987 with a $1.67 billion surplus, in contrast to a $1.84 billion deficit in 1986.    A Warburg Securities economist, Kevin Gardiner, was less optimistic. He said exports gained a temporary and unsustainable boost recently from higher crude-oil sales. British imports will rise as the year progresses because of stronger consumer demand, tax cuts and lower interest rates, he said. Warburg Securities expects the current account to be in deficit by $2.93 billion this year and by a larger figure in 1988.    With its forecast of a $4.69 billion current-account deficit this year, stockbrokerage James Capel andamp; Co. is still gloomier. &quot;I don't think there's a turnaround&quot; in Britain's trading performance, said Nigel Rendell, a Capel economist. He said the current account already may have accumulated a $251 million deficit in April. </TEXT></DOC>
