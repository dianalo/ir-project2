At the same time, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthat first lady Nancy Reagan ``was given to understand'' thatanother former Reagan aide, Michael K. Deaver, had discussed apardon with someone in the White House.   Deaver, however, said he never had discussed a pardon for histhree perjury convictions with the president, the first lady or anygovernment official.   Nofziger wrote a letter to the president ``a number of weeksago'' to state his refusal to accept any pardon that might becontemplated before Reagan leaves office next month, said defenseattorney E. Lawrence Barcella.   ``He happens to be an honorable guy who strongly believes in hisinnocence and consequently felt that his vindication should comethrough the courts and not through the president,'' Barcella said.   ``It was something purely on his own initiative,'' Barcella saidof Nofziger's letter.   Nofziger, 63, is free on bond while appealing a 90-day sentenceand $30,000 fine he received earlier this year for three felonyethics-law convictions.   He was found guilty of lobbying former Reagan administrationcolleagues on behalf of private clients after he resigned in early1981 as White House political director. He was convicted ofviolating the one-year ban on lobbying by former officials afterleaving office.   Reagan repeatedly has ruled out a pre-trial pardon for formerWhite House aide Oliver North, who is one of four people underindictment in the Iran-Contra affair. The president last week saideven considering such a pardon ``would leave them under a shadow ofguilt for the rest of their lives. I think the law has got to takeits course.''   Nofziger, who likened his offense to running a stop sign, hasrepeatedly professed his innocence and criticized the Ethics inGovernment Act for not imposing lobbying restrictions on formermembers of Congress as well as officials of Cabinet agencies.   A federal appeals court that heard arguments on the case Nov. 22appeared receptive to arguments by Nofziger's attorneys that theconviction should be overturned because prosecutors didn't prove awillful violation of the law.   Members of the three-judge panel questioned whether the statuteprovided a clear warning to former officials of what wouldconstitute illegal lobbying.   Barcella said Nofziger wrote Reagan before the appellate panelheard arguments in the case.   Deaver, the former deputy White House chief of staff, said inresponse to a reporter's question: ``I have never discussed a pardonwith the Reagans, either or them, and I don't have any intentionto.''   Deaver was given a suspended three-year sentence, fined $100,000and ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service for lying toCongress and a grand jury investigating his lobbying business forpossible ethics-law violations. He is appealing the three felonyconvictions.   Deaver also denied raising the pardon issue in discussions or aletter to anyone in government. ``I never wrote anybody a letterabout a pardon.''   Deaver refused to further discuss the issue of a pardon.</TEXT></DOC>
