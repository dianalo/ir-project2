The position of the two holding companies -- Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. and the Tractebel S.A. affiliate of Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. -- improved with the collapse of a competing offer for IC Gas by the Dutch energy group SHV Holdings N.V. That offer, equal to $11.10 a share, didn't lure the minimum 7.5% of IC Gas shares that SHV had set and is now &quot;void,&quot; the merchant bank N.M. Rothschild andamp; Sons said.    SHV wanted to acquire an additional 23% stake in the British natural-gas company beyond the 4.9% it already holds. Rothschild didn't say how many shares were offered to SHV.    But it said IC Gas holders who agreed to sell their shares to SHV will be allowed to accept the competing bid of $11.26 a share made last Friday by the two Belgian holding companies, which were acting in an informal joint venture.    Analysts attributed SHV's failure not only to the drawing power of the higher bid but also to investor expectations of a third, even more attractive offer.    However, the Belgian group, which already owns 14.9% of IC Gas, said it needs only an additional 1.5% -- one-tenth of its original goal -- to consider its offer a success. Financial analysts said that level would easily be reached.    Moreover, they said, possibilities of an accord between the Belgians and SHV to trade off their complementary interests appear increasingly likely.    SHV was mainly interested in IC Gas's liquid petroleum business, whereas the Belgian group wants IC Gas's interests in several Belgian utilities and its more than 7% stake in Petrofina, Belgium's largest industrial concern.    Under a restructuring plan that shareholders will vote on this month, IC Gas would be split into two companies, Calor Group PLC for the liquid gas, and Contibel Holdings PLC for the Belgian energy interests. If the measure is approved, the Belgian bidders could arrange a swap of Calor shares for Contibel shares, or launch a separate bid for Contibel.    Should the Belgians gain control of IC Gas's stake in Petrofina, they will acquire enough Petrofina board seats and voting rights to block any major initiative or outside takeover attempt.    Geoffrey Knight, a director at Henry Ansbacher andamp; Co., one of the merchant banks working for the Belgian group, estimated it would get &quot;at least 5% to 6% more&quot; of IC Gas. </TEXT></DOC>
