Nopickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   RJR Nabisco Inc. directors tried to flush outmore offers for the giant consumer products company Wednesday byissuing a statement saying they are interested in reviewingacquisition proposals.   The announcement came more than a week after Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co. launched an unprecedented $20.3 billion tender offerfor Nabisco. The aggressive New York buyout firm is offering to pay$90 a share for the company under the condition that Nabiscomanagement approve the deal.   A statement issued by a special committee of Nabisco's board saidit is interested in hearing from ``credible parties wishing topresent (acquisition) proposals.''   Charles Hugel, who chairs the committee of outside directors thatwas appointed to review takeover proposals, said the group believes``this will serve the best interest of all shareholders.''   A spokesman for Nabisco characterized the committee's statementas ``very responsible. They want to make sure the world knows ifanyone wants to make an offer.''   But market observers have said it was unlikely that a higheroffer would emerge. Some even have acknowledged the possibility thatKohlberg Kravis, which has begun to receive a stream of financialdata from Nabisco, might even lower its bid after reviewing thematerial.   Nabisco executives and their primary financial partner, ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc., were believed to be working on acounter-proposal to Kohlberg Kravis's bid, which would be thelargest corporate acquisition in U.S. history.   But there was no indication that the group would be able to matchthe Kohlberg Kravis offer.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nabisco rose $1.75 toclose at $86.75 a share on Wednesday.   Two weeks ago, Nabisco Chief Executive F. Ross Johnson andShearson Lehman said they were considering a $75-a-share, $17billion deal to take the company private. Since then, the companyhas also signed up Salomon Brothers Inc. as adviser and financialpartner.   Rumors on Wall Street circulated that Kohlberg Kravis might beunder pressure to withdraw from the bidding process. Severalinstitutional investors in the firm's leveraged buyout fund, whichwould provide a small part of the financing for the takeover, arebalking on the grounds that the firm's approach is hostile.   Typically, Kohlberg Kravis works with management members, who areinstrumental in running a target company after it is acquired.</TEXT></DOC>
