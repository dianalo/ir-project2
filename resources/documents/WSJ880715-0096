The poll found the Massachusetts governor leading the vice president by a margin of 48% to 36% -- virtually unchanged from a Journal/NBC poll last month -- among those voters considered the most likely to vote in November. Among all registered voters, the poll shows Mr. Bush narrowing the gap somewhat from last month, but still well behind.    The survey was conducted last Friday through Monday. Thus, it was concluded before Mr. Dukakis selected Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen to be his vice presidential running mate and the ensuing anger from followers of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. However, the survey did follow the first concerted Republican onslaught against Mr. Dukakis, the certain Democratic presidential nominee.    On issues, the survey doesn't show any clear advantage for either candidate; Mr. Dukakis is seen as better able to handle some of the nation's problems, Mr. Bush others. But the poll indicates that many voters continue to feel uncomfortable with Mr. Bush on more personal grounds, finding him for instance less honest and straightforward than the Democrat, and less caring about their concerns.    Overall, the poll found, 49% of likely voters had a favorable opinion of the vice president, while an extremely high 42% had an unfavorable view. In contrast, 58% had a favorable view of Mr. Dukakis, while 25% had an unfavorable view.    When likely voters were asked whether Mr. Bush &quot;really cares about people like you,&quot; 45% said yes while 42% said no; when the same question was asked about Mr. Dukakis, 65% said yes, 23% no.    In a series of questions on personal characteristics of the candidates, twice as many people thought the Massachusetts governor is &quot;generally an honest, straightforward person&quot; as thought that way about the vice president. More people also thought that the Democrat &quot;has the competence to be a good president&quot; and &quot;has a strong stand on the issues&quot; than felt that way about Mr. Bush.    On specific issues, the Journal/NBC survey found Mr. Dukakis favored -- though sometimes not by big margins -- on the issues of reducing the budget deficit, handling the nation's drug problems and avoiding scandals in his administration. The two candidates are basically even on handling the nation's economic problems and keeping inflation down, and Mr. Bush has a solid edge on maintaining a strong defense and handling relations with the Soviet Union. By a narrow margin, voters would also rather see him as president in case of a sudden crisis that required swift action.    Hoping to make crime a major issue in the campaign, GOP political strategists have been pointing to Massachusetts's work-furlough program for convicts and Mr. Dukakis's opposition to the death penalty as evidence that the governor is soft on the issue. According to the survey, likely voters now are evenly divided on the question of which candidate would do a better job of being tough on crime.    About half of likely voters said that a presidential candidate's opposition to the death penalty wouldn't have a major effect on their presidential vote. But of those who said it would have an effect, two out of three said it would make them less likely to vote for the candidate.    The Journal/NBC poll shows that Mr. Bush is still suffering from a wide &quot;gender gap&quot; in his support. While Mr. Dukakis leads the vice president by only six percentage points among likely male voters, the Democrat has a 17-point lead among women. That margin is little changed from the previous Journal/NBC poll. Among all registered voters -- including those who aren't the most likely to vote -- Mr. Bush halved Mr. Dukakis's margin among women in the latest poll, but the Democrat's lead among females remains comfortable.    Mr. Dukakis continues to do well among &quot;swing&quot; voters who made up a vital part of Ronald Reagan's political constituency, voters that Mr. Bush needs if he is to win. For instance, the poll shows the Massachusetts governor still holding a commanding lead of 66% to 19% among those Democratic likely voters who cast ballots for Mr. Reagan over Walter Mondale in 1984. Among all blue-collar voters, Mr. Dukakis leads by a margin of 50% to 30%.    The poll shows that the Democratic candidate leads in all regions of the country. Surprisingly, his margin is widest in the West, which has been hostile territory for Democratic presidential candidates in recent elections. According to the poll, Mr. Dukakis currently holds a lead of 52% to 33% among likely voters there. The Massachusetts governor holds leads of 14 points in the East and 12 points in the Midwest; in the South, he clings to a narrower five-point edge.    It's too soon to know what effect this week's developments may have on those voters. Mr. Dukakis's selection of Sen. Bentsen as his running mate could help the Democrats with voters in the South, as well as with other conservatives who were turned off by the liberal cast of previous Democratic tickets.    However, the ruckus over Mr. Dukakis's handling of the Rev. Jackson and his followers, if not checked, could affect the enthusiasm of black voters for the ticket, and conceivably even raise questions about the Democratic nominee's political competence.    The survey found that about six in 10 voters are generally pleased with the choice for president that they will be presented with in November. However, only about one in four Dukakis voters and one in four Bush supporters describe themselves as strong supporters of their candidates, indicating that feelings about the two men are still far from solidified.    ---           The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll   &quot;If the election for president were being held today, would you vote for George Bush, the Republican or Michael Dukakis, the Democrat?&quot;    Dukakis      48%         Bush      36%   &quot;In general, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of . . .&quot;    Michael Dukakis    Favorable         58%    Unfavorable   25%    George Bush    Favorable         49%    Unfavorable   42%</TEXT></DOC>
