A superconductinginduction detector with three mutually orthogonal loops and 476 cm{sup2} sensing area averaged over solid angle was in operation at Stanfordfrom 25 Jan. 1983 to 20 March 1986. It set a monopole flux limit of 4.4x 10{sup -12} cm{sup -2} s{sup -1} sr{sup -1} at 90% confidence limit,the best limit to date with a superconducting detector. This work describesthe three-loop detector in detail, provides theoretical analysis of thedetector response to a flux of magnetic monopoles, and describes resultsobtained from the detector. The detector response is found from MonteCarlo simulation of monopole trajectories to determine the locus of possiblemonopole signals. In addition, a larger detector has been constructedwith eight loops laid in octagonal fashion around a cylinder and 1.5m{sup 2} sensing area averaged over solid angle, a factor of 30 largerthan the three-loop detector. General design aspects of the eight-loopdetector are discussed and a similar theoretical analysis of this detectoris provided. The detectors are found to be very discriminating againstspurious signals.</TEXT></DOC>
