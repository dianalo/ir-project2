The restrictive amendment, sponsored by Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), was attached to the defense budget authorization bill being debated on the Senate floor. Similar curbs on foreign contracts under the program, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, have been attached to a House-passed version of the defense bill.    Approval of the provision, which is part of a pending defense bill, came after the Senate adopted an amendment that would limit next year's SDI experiments to ones that complied with the traditional interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic-missile treaty, which curbs U.S. and Soviet development of anti-missile systems.    While President Reagan wants to move to a more liberal interpretation of the arms accord, Pentagon officials have said that for the time being they don't have any plans to conduct SDI tests that go beyond the narrower reading of the treaty.    Still, the president has threatened to veto such a measure on the ground that it interferes with his right to negotiate and interpret treaties. The measure was sponsored by Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) of the Senate Armed Service Committee.    The amendments on overseas contracts undercut agreements the Pentagon negotiated with five U.S. allies in recent years. These agreements -- entered with Britain, West Germany, Israel, Italy and Japan -- provide the legal framework for foreign companies and laboratories to compete freely for Pentagon contracts under the multibillion-dollar project to research antiballistic-missile technologies.    The accords have also had the consequence of building support for the controversial research project among U.S. allies, who had initially expressed skepticism toward President Reagan's vision of developing space-based weapons to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles.    European officials expressed outrage over the amendment. &quot;I think it's terrible,&quot; said an official with Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, a West German manufacturer that has netted about $45 million in SDI contracts so far. &quot;You make an agreement with the U.S. and the Congress undercuts it.&quot; Although the amendment doesn't affect contracts already awarded, it will make it harder for MBB and other foreign concerns to compete for future SDI work.    The Glenn amendment, adopted by voice vote, would bar the Pentagon from awarding SDI contracts overseas unless the defense decretary certified that there aren't any U.S. concerns that could &quot;competently&quot; perform the research for the same amount of money. Under an amendment approved 61-32, a foreign company could avoid the cumbersome certification procedure if it put up a significant sum of its own money to carry out the research.    This is often the practice in research contracts, so the provision eased the financial impact of the Glenn amendment. But it didn't quell European anger over the political message being sent.    &quot;It's blatantly protectionist and discriminatory,&quot; said a British diplomat. &quot;As a political signal, we regard it as bad news.&quot;    European officials noted that their governments weathered harsh political opposition domestically when they entered the SDI agreements with the U.S. &quot;We took something of a political risk, and now they throw it back in our faces,&quot; said the British diplomat.    In pushing for the amendment, however, Sen. Glenn emphasized threats to the U.S. competitive position. &quot;They support Star Wars on the basis of getting research money to help them build up their scientific community to make them more capable of outcompeting the United States,&quot; he said.    Separately, the Pentagon met with congressional criticism over the resignation of Richard Godwin, the Defense Department's first undersecretary for weapons acquisition. Mr. Godwin, who encountered resistance from the military services and from other offices in the Defense Department, quit the post last week.    According to Deputy Secretary William Taft IV, Mr. Godwin resigned after concluding &quot;that the job he had come to Washington to do wasn't doable.&quot; Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Taft said Mr. Godwin misperceived the nature of the post when he assumed it a year ago.    Noting that Mr. Godwin was Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's choice for the job, Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.) said the prospects for meaningful change in procurement procedures were slim. &quot;If it doesn't work with Dick Godwin, who's it going to work with?&quot; he asked. &quot;It doesn't look good.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
