On Jan. 27, London-based Christie's International PLC will auction off the furniture and art collection of Congoleum Corp. at Christie's New York salesroom. The nearly 300 items, from antique candlesticks to the chairman's desk, are expected to fetch at least $2 million.    Portsmouth, N.H.-based Congoleum was sold last year to various parties in four transactions by its two top executives. The company, whose biggest unit was Bath Iron Works, a major shipbuilder, had been taken private in a leveraged buyout in 1980.    Christie's was asked to sell the headquarters building's contents; the building itself is in the hands of a commercial real estate broker.    Christie's makes it clear that the cachet of this auction property -- which isn't of staggering historical importance and includes many reproductions -- comes largely from the person who collected it. Eddy Nicholson, former president of Congoleum, is now the most visible and possibly the biggest collector of American furniture in the country. Until Mr. Nicholson came along, a piece of American antique furniture had never sold for $1 million; he paid that and more twice last year at auctions. A million-dollar table and million-dollar armchair now sit side-by-side at his home in Hampton Falls, N.H.    &quot;A lot of people know about Eddy Nicholson as a collector,&quot; says Dean Failey, a senior vice president at Christie's in charge of American decorative arts. &quot;I think it would be fun for a collector to be able to say: 'Hey, want to know who used to own this chair?'&quot;    In addition to private collectors, Christie's has targeted as potential buyers local decorators, small businesses that might be furnishing their offices and curators of corporate art collections.    &quot;It's an ideal shopping experience for a corporate collector, because it's a chance to buy something in quantity that has already been culled,&quot; says Jay Cantor, a paintings authority at Christie's. The paintings in the auction are among the most valuable lots, including one of duck shooters by Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait, with an estimate of $250,000 to $350,000.    Bidders can also pick up sofas, desks, tables, rugs and fireplace tools, for prices ranging from two figures to six. There are table lamps, for example, estimated to go for as little as $30.    The Congoleum collection will be on view to the public at Christie's for 10 days beginning this Saturday.    Meanwhile, Christie's arch rival, Sotheby's, is wondering what the fuss is about. &quot;This is hardly new,&quot; says a spokesman for the New York unit of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc. He says Sotheby's was the first to sell a whole corporate art collection, and has done so more than once. Way back in 1956, says the spokesman, Sotheby's auctioned off a collection of 100 cigar store Indians owned by Narragansett Brewing Co. of Providence, R.I. </TEXT></DOC>
