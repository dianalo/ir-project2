<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-42-0897 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the traditional Z scheme of photosynthesis the Emerson effects of reddrop (decline in yield of photosynthesis in far-red light) and enhancement(of far-red yield by supplementary short-wavelength light) are takento be evidence for the coupling in series of two photosystems that absorbunsymmetrically in the far-red region of the spectrum. An alternativeexplanation for red drop and enhancement is proposed here that does notinvoke the series-coupling hypothesis. It is suggested that the Emersoneffects may be due to the drop in intensity of radiation from sampleabsorption, which causes a photochemical loss when the reaction shutsoff at depth in the medium. The effects of oxygen, carbon dioxide, andtemperature on the yield may also be interpreted in terms of this model.</TEXT></DOC>
