Small businesses are warming to these export jointventures as a way to limit risks, save money and studyforeign markets with help from U.S. companies in the sameindustry. For export purposes, participating firms getvirtual antitrust immunity, allowing them to trade marketdata and prices so long as it doesn't affect competition inthe U.S.   So far, the Commerce Department has issued 130certificates providing such antitrust immunity to nearly5,000 U.S. companies. (About 3,000 firms in the NationalTooling and Machining Association use one certificate.)   Once certified, a group of small manufacturers, forexample, can commit inventory to be sold, with agreements notto compete as individual companies. They share responsibilityfor obtaining licenses and permits, and typically dividecosts. They also split profits, and often enter foreignmarkets individually later.   Catfish farmers, flour millers and textile manufacturersare among those that have had results from the cartelapproach. Last year, 11 companies that produce surimi, aprocessed-fish product used in imitation seafood, formed theU.S. Surimi Commission. The companies, based in the PacificNorthwest, previously couldn't penetrate the Japanese market.In addition to sharing costs and information, they recentlysent a five-member delegation to Japan.   &quot;We've finally got a foothold,&quot; says Paul MacGregor, whorepresents the commission. He says U.S. surimi exports toJapan rose to $250 million last year from virtually nothingfive years ago.   U.S. companies have been able to trade information since1982, but many have only recently begun to do so. Smallfirms, says a Commerce Department spokeswoman, are learning&quot;that they'll have to export to survive.&quot;                                                                                                          Trade Leads Become   Available by Fax                                                                                                          SMALL BUSINESSES looking for overseas trade leads shouldget to a fax machine.   The World Trade Centers Association in November introduceda way to use its WTC Network, a listing of internationaloffers to buy and sell, by fax machine. The nonprofit agency,which represents 140 on-line trade centers around the world,says the service gets about 500 calls a day.   By dialing 1-900-FAX-4WTC, a U.S. or foreign firm can pullup lists of goods and services to buy and sell in 12categories, 24 hours a day. Punching a six-digit number intothe fax machine lets a caller order a printout describing anoffer in detail, with a contact name and phone number. Theaverage call costs about $11.   Recent listings include live sheep, turkey necks anddetails on forming a caviar-distribution partnership. Incountries where the pay-per-minute, 900-number service isn'tavailable, the information is available to callers throughcredit-card charges.   The fax system has won praise from the CommerceDepartment, but some trade specialists caution that listingsfor one-time sales and purchases don't encourage long-termbusiness relationships.                                                                                                          Federal Export Programs   Overlap Despite Changes                                                                                                          FEDERAL AGENCIES run overlapping, often competing,programs to promote U.S. exports, despite streamliningefforts.   That's the gist of testimony federal legislators haveheard, and will hear again in coming months. A GeneralAccounting Office director gave the message to a Senatesubcommittee in May. And this month, the House Committee onGovernment Operations requested a report from the GAOanalyzing redundant trade promotion efforts, particularly bythe Commerce Department and the Small BusinessAdministration.   Over 15 government agencies now help promote exports. TheCommerce Department and the SBA both offer counseling andmarket information through their network offices, and sponsoroverseas trade missions. The Export-Import Bank, the SBA andthe Agriculture Department all offer loan and guaranteeprograms.   The testimony is particularly critical of governmentspending priorities. For example, though agricultural exportswere 11% of the U.S. total in 1990, the AgricultureDepartment had $1 billion to promote exports, more than halfof the federal total, says Allan Mendelowitz, the GAOdirector. Some of that funding went toward advertisingprograms for such established companies as McDonald's andKraft General Foods. An Agriculture Department spokesman saysits congressional mandate includes promoting exports bycompanies of all sizes.   Reform efforts receive mixed reviews. Mr. Mendelowitzpraised the Commerce Department's U.S. and Foreign CommercialService for efforts to streamline. But the GAO noted that therecently created Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee hasno clear role or budget authority and has done little morethan provide a series of conferences to promote exports.However, a spokesman for the committee says the conferenceshave done far more than similar events in the past, and thecommittee has developed a more streamlined strategy.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          MORE COLLEGES start export service centers. BryantCollege's Rhode Island Export Assistance Center matches smallcompanies in the state with 1,000 trade leads a month, and isforming a trading bloc of New England firms. . . . TheCommerce Department is releasing 50,000 copies of &quot;The ExportYellow Pages,&quot; filled with listings and ads of about 7,000U.S. companies.</TEXT></DOC>
