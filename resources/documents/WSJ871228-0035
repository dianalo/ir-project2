Robert Dole (Bob to me) on the occasion of his carefully selected mailing.    Dear Bob:   At the risk of breaking politico-politicee confidentiality, I salute you publicly for acknowledging that the success of the Dole for President Campaign rests in my hands.    After a lifetime of liberal Democratic politics, I am prepared to switch my allegiance because of the honor you bestow. In a letter directed to me personally, you say, &quot;I have had the 1988 DOLE FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN BATTLE PLAN prepared especially for you.&quot;    You then demonstrate your trust: &quot;Since this report contains highly sensitive political information, I'm sending it only to those persons whom I firmly believe will support my candidacy for president.&quot;    You proceed to take me aside even further: &quot;Due to the confidential nature of the material, your battle plan has been assigned serial number (dare I reveal it?) 00-952774 and is registered with your name in my campaign headquarters. That's why it is absolutely necessary that you, AND ONLY YOU, read its contents.&quot;    I snap to attention and read on. &quot;I know I can be elected President if I can count on you for two crucially important things: your staunch political support and your faithful financial assistance.&quot; Yes, yes, I sing out when I realize you are offering me the chance to send money. In my haste to get my checkbook, I step on a grandchild's skate and end up in a heap under a portrait of G.A. Potemkin.    By this time you have me in the palm of your hand, especially when you scare me with the next paragraph: &quot;I fear that unless you and I act together, the presidential election is going to be decided by the manipulative power of a Democratic Congress (good grief) or the money and influence of liberal special interest groups.&quot; I couldn't agree with you more, Bob; we can't have our government stumbling around with that awkward two-party system, nor let the presidency fall into the hands of those Democratic fat cats.    With trepidation, I take the DOLE FOR PRESIDENT 1988 CAMPAIGN BATTLE PLAN number 00-952774 in hand. It is light blue, folded and sealed so the inside cannot be read except for &quot;eyes only&quot; confidants like me. The instructions on the outside are clear:    1.Break seal on Campaign Battle Plan.    2.Read contents very carefully.    3.Decide exactly how much you can contribute to help implement strategy in each state.    4.Return your gift in postage-paid envelope provided.    I down a stiff drink and tear the yellow seal; the document tumbles open, and I am momentarily overcome with the responsibility you place on me. It is the Dole for President political strategy in 16 key states. I realize my importance to its success, because it says: &quot;This plan will succeed only with the participation of EVERY Dole for President supporter across the country.&quot; Just think -- if I should do the unthinkable and fail to respond, your chances would come crashing down. At this moment I realize I am an authentic kingmaker. I determine to use my power humbly.    But wait. Of the 16 state plans from Alabama to Washington, my own state of Connecticut is not listed. How can I help implement a battle plan that is not set forth? Under South Dakota, for instance, the strategy is, &quot;We must do whatever it takes to see that no other candidate gets a foothold here.&quot; For me to function in my state, I will need a plan like that. Perhaps Connecticut is important enough to have its own sealed strategy.    In the end, I am so impressed with the well-conceived plans for the 16 states (like the one in South Dakota), that I overlook the omission. You further restore my confidence by saying, &quot;Without your generosity, my chances of becoming President will be in serious jeopardy.&quot;    I am prepared to write you a check for thousands, but your restraining hand reaches out. &quot;I am asking you today to send a contribution of $16.&quot; I am in awe; You, Bob, can make it to the presidency if a few selected friends send $16. Now that's what I call real money management.    You wipe me out with your ending: &quot;I've been as HONEST with you as I know how: America needs the kind of leadership a team like you and I can provide.&quot;    Count me in, Bob; with that kind of open, straightforward approach, how could I consider supporting anyone else?    Your Close Colleague,   Thomas A. Gaines,   Former Democrat   P.S. I look forward to many useful consultations with you in the oval room. </TEXT></DOC>
