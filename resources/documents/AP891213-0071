A government official of this British colony, meanwhile, saidthe repatriation program would continue despite internationalcriticism.   ``It is our intention to put into place a continuing program toreturn to Vietnam all those who are judged not to be refugees,''Chief Secretary Sir David Ford told the Legislative Council. Hisspeech did not include a timetable for further repatriation.   The approximately 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into HongKong since June 1988 are considered illegal ``economic'' immigrantsunless they can prove the fled their Communist homeland fearingpersecution.   Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after beingscreened by immigration officials. A few more than 700 havequalified.   The first batch to be sent home against their will were whiskedscreaming and crying from their detention center by riot policebefore dawn Tuesday and put on a plane to Hanoi.   Vietnam has promised the returnees will be treated humanely.   The Hanoi government said today that the boat people fled theirhomeland because embargoes by non-Communist nations had createdeconomic problems in Vietnam and because the refugees had receivedfalse hopes of better economic opportunity in Hong Kong. Vietnamcondemned the forced repatriation.   The demonstrations today were ``peaceful and orderly'' asVietnamese marched around the camps chanting slogans and wavingbanners protesting involuntary repatriation, said governmentspokesman Lionel Rodrigues.   Local radio quoted some protesters as saying they would ratherdie in Hong Kong than be forced back home.   About 3,000 boat people marched in Hei Ling Chau detentioncenter, a former leper colony on an outlying island, and another3,000 protested at Whitehead camp in the New Territories. About 300more demonstrated at Chi Ma Wan center on outlying Lantau Island.   The longest demonstration lasted two hours and all were over byevening, Rodrigues said. ``Basically, it wasn't very unruly. Theyjust marched around the compound,'' he said.   The Hong Kong government argues that sending the Vietnamese backhome is more humane than keeping them indefinitely in the camps,which are overcrowded and rife with violence and malnutrition.   But human rights organizations, British opposition politiciansand the U.S. government have criticized the program. The U.S. StateDepartment expressed deep regret over the repatriations and said``British authorities should continue to grant asylum to all thosepersons from Vietnam who seek it.''   Ford responded to critics by saying that ``those who have beenloudest in their condemnation have been slowest in bringing forwardpractical alternatives. We have returned no one who in the eyes ofthe international community is a bonafide refugee.''   He added: ``We do not look for the world's applause, but we areentitled, I feel, to the world's understanding.''   Hong Kong and Britain maintain that the territory already isswamped with Vietnamese boat people and mandatory repatriation isneeded to discourage another influx when the new sailing seasonbegins next year.   They claim that most Vietnamese now sailing into Hong Kong arenot escaping persecution but only seeking a better life.   About 56,000 Vietnamese are housed in the colony's squalidcamps. Those who arrived before June 1988 automatically weregranted refugee status and are eligible for resettlement.</TEXT></DOC>
