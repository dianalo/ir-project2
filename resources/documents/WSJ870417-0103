The pleas had been expected.    In a series of arraignments yesterday that drew an overflow crowd of 200 onlookers, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former chairman of Los Angeles-based Jefferies, admitted to two criminal charges. The guilty plea related to market-manipulation charges that the 56-year-old executive earlier settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on March 19, the day he resigned as chairman.    The charges didn't allege insider trading. But Mr. Jefferies admitted to the judge that he had engaged in a stock parking scheme with Ivan F. Boesky and in a separate scheme that has previously been identified as involving a public offering of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock.    U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker set sentencing for June 5, though prosecutors said that date will probably be postponed because of Mr. Jefferies's continued cooperation with the government. Mr. Jefferies faces a maximum 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines. He has already been barred from the U.S. securities industry for at least five years as part of his SEC settlement.    Mr. Jefferies's lawyer said he had been retained by Mr. Jefferies last November, about the same time Mr. Boesky settled with the SEC and began cooperating with the government.    Shortly before Mr. Jefferies pleaded guilty, three prominent Wall Street takeover speculators came forward and pleaded innocent to insider-trading charges filed earlier this month.    The three -- Robert M. Freeman, a partner and head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs and Co.; Richard B. Wigton, a recently suspended head of arbitrage at Kidder, Peabody and Co.; and former Kidder arbitrager Timothy L. Tabor -- each said &quot;not guilty&quot; after Judge Lasker asked for their pleas. The three had been arrested in February, two of them in their offices. Their case was assigned to federal Judge Louis L. Stanton. </TEXT></DOC>
