Harry Garfinkle pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter Mondayin the Jan. 21 death of his 84-year-old wife, Frances, in theirhome.   Assistant District Attorney Judith Rubino said she doubtedCommon Pleas Court Judge Lisa Richette will sentence Garfinkle tojail. No sentencing date has been set.   ``I do not see the need for a jail sentence for this man,'' Ms.Rubino said. Mrs. Garfinkle ``was very sick and he just snapped.''   Garfinkle, a retired paperhanger who now lives in a retirementhome, said his last 26 years of marriage were torture. At the timeof her death, Mrs. Garfinkle was bedridden, deaf, and blind in oneeye. She continued to suffer the effects of a serious stomachoperation, which left her dependent on her husband.   After pleading guilty, Garfinkle recalled his wife's demands:``Complain, complain, complain. ... `Harry, give me this. Harry,get me that.'''   He also recalled that after strangling his wife with a necktie,he told her, ``Frances, what did you make me do this for?''   The judge gave Garfinkle a Bible and told him to read it everynight, but he said later he wouldn't because ``the letters are toosmall.''   ``I don't believe in anything anymore,'' he said. ``If there's aLord up there, why did he let it go on for so long?''   Garfinkle said the couple's four children did not blame him forthe killing. At Monday's hearing, one son, Marvin Garfinkle, toldthe judge his mother was ``extremely demanding, and, at the end,she didn't really know how demanding she was.''   The father said if he could live his life again, he would notget married.   The day of the slaying, he recalled, his wife's right foot wasseverely swollen, she could no longer control her bladder and shewas in pain. She asked her husband when he was going to makebreakfast.   ``That was it,'' Garfinkle recalled. ``I just exploded. You justcome to the breaking point. She drove me to it.''   After strangling his wife, Garfinkle said, he swallowed 17sleeping pills in an attempt to kill himself.   At first, he lied to police, telling them Mrs. Garfinkle hadfallen out of her bed and that he had found her dead. Later, heconfessed.   ``I pitied her so,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
