Militant black unions launched a two-week, nationwide consumerboycott of white-owned stores and told their 1.5 million members torefuse to work overtime for the next four weeks.   Union leaders said the no-overtime protest could cut industrialproduction by 20 percent or force white employers to hire thousandsof additional black workers. The unions are protesting acontroversial labor law that was enacted last year despite vehementobjections from black unions.   Some of the original, hard-line provisions of the Labor RelationsAmendment Act were modified, but unions still object to sectionsthat prohibit sympathy strikes, restrict the frequency of strikesagainst a particular company, and make it easier for unions to beheld liable for strike-related losses.   In Durban, South Africa's largest port and third-largest city, anestimated 15,000 people, including members of the white citycouncil, joined a peaceful anti-government march to City Hall.   Activists raised the green, black and gold banner of the outlawedAfrican National Congress guerrilla movement on the flagpole atDurban's City Hall, and police allowed it to remain during the rally.   ``We ask (President F.W.) de Klerk and (Law and Order MinisterAdriaan) Vlok to come down from their ivory towers and join thepeople,'' said Jay Naidoo, secretary-general of the 1-million-memberCongress of South African Trade Unions.   The congress is leading the consumer boycott, along with theNational Congress of Trade Unions, which claims 500,000 blackmembers.   Police raided 11 offices of the congress around the countryFriday and confiscated documents related to the boycott, the laborfederation said.   Meanwhile, about 10,000 protesters led by the Rev. Allan Boesakstaged a similar march in Oudtshoorn, a city of about 40,000 people300 miles east of Cape Town.   It was by far the largest protest ever in Oudtshoorn, center ofthe ostrich-farming industry and the scene of frequentconfrontations between police and activists.   ``We're asking for trouble just to be black in a conservativewhite town like this,'' Boesak said.   But, he added, ``It's just about time that places like this takenotice of the fact that the march for freedom has begun and nobody,not even Oudtshoorn, will turn us around.''   After a 5.5-mile march, the protesters presented police with alist of demands, including a halt to alleged harassment of activists.   A coalition of anti-apartheid women's groups vowed to ignore agovernment ban and proceed with a march Saturday on governmentheadquarters in Pretoria.   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said the government obtained acourt injunction to stop the march because organizers did not applyfor approval. Two white supremacist groups sought and receivedpermission to hold rallies Saturday in Pretoria.   The government, for the first time in decades, has allowedseveral protest marches this month and says it will not disruptpeaceful demonstrations that have been authorized in advance.   Naidoo and other union leaders urged all blacks to join theconsumer boycott, which they said was part of a broadbased nationaldefiance campaign launched in early August.   There was no immediate word from retail organizations about theextent of the boycott.   However, department stores in the southern cities of East Londonand King William's Town, where the boycott began early, werereported virtually deserted Thursday.   The defiance campaign has included protests of segregation lawsas well as marches in several cities.   The marches had been peaceful until Thursday, when some blackyouths smashed windows of shops and vehicles in the southeasterncity of Pietermaritzburg.   No injuries and only one arrest were reported, but pro-governmentmedia gave headline treatment to the incident.   The government said Friday that organizers of protest marchesmust request permission at least seven days in advance. Leaders ofmost of the recent marches have refused to seek a permit, but thegovernment approved them anyway.</TEXT></DOC>
