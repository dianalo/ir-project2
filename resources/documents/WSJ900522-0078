Astronomical figures for the cost of the bailout, whichgrab the headlines in the face of the uncertainty thatsurrounds this endeavor, may even be on the low side. What isoften overlooked is that the principal sum is a net figure,the difference between government liabilities (what it mustpay insured depositors) and government receipts (what itcollects from the sale of assets). Thus a price tag of $50billion is an estimate that the government will pay out thatmuch more than it receives.</LP><TEXT>   The government has yet to demonstrate its ability to sellrepossessed assets. In fact, some may even question whetherit has ever demonstrated the desire to sell such assets. Thatis why the attitude of L. William Seidman, chairman of theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Resolution TrustCorporation, is so refreshing. He has made it clear he isready to deal now.   Of course, the market is very depressed. Congress made thethrifts and their assets very unattractive to buy. For themost part, the government will have to sell the thrifts'assets to help pay off insured depositors. While performingassets may go for a fair return, who will buy that vast seaof bad assets, which Mr. Seidman refers to as &quot;opportunity&quot;assets? He has correctly characterized the sale of illiquid&quot;opportunity&quot; assets as &quot;where our game will ultimately bewon or lost.&quot;   I am greatly concerned that there will not be a market forthese bad assets at a price that will generate necessaryreturns to hold taxpayer burdens in line with governmentprojections. If, for example, the government has to pay out$450 billion to insured depositors, then it must collect $400billion for the assets in order to hold losses to $50billion, as originally estimated in the Sandamp;L legislation.   Mr. Seidman states: &quot;If a property doesn't sell, itprobably will be because we're asking too much and we'll haveto reduce our price.&quot; But if we collect only $300 billion forthe assets, the taxpayer is on the hook for $150 billion, notjust $50 billion. The taxpayer, of course, foots the bill forthe losses.   If we continue on this path, the assets probably will notsell at the price necessary to limit taxpayer's liability to$50 billion. Then, whatever the ultimate loss, the governmentwill issue Treasury securities to raise the cash to pay offinsured depositors and the taxpayer will pay billions ininterest and principal.   But wait] It doesn't have to be that expensive. If theinterest were offered to asset purchasers as a guarantee ofincome rather than to purchasers of Treasury securities, theworst that could happen is a wash and the best is that theprincipal payment would be saved.   My idea would work like this: Suppose that the RTC assets(real estate assets, in this example) had to be sold for $400billion, close to book value, to keep the taxpayer loss downto $50 billion. But the market is depressed and the fairmarket value today for all the assets is, let us say, only$300 billion. The government would sell RTC assets coupledwith a special Treasury security in an amount to bridge thegap between the low selling price of the asset and its&quot;necessary&quot; value to keep taxpayer losses down. In thisexample, the special securities issued would total $100billion, the difference between $400 billion and $300billion.   The purchasers of the asset and the special security wouldhave several options. They could hold both, sell both, orpart with one. The holders of the security would receiveinterest payments for 20 years regardless of the value of theconnected asset. At maturity, if the asset had appreciated toat least the necessary value, the government would not beobligated to pay anything. If the asset had depreciated, thegovernment would pay the principal in full, as it would on amature Treasury security. If the asset had appreciated some,but not up to necessary value, the government would pay thedifference between its actual value and the necessary value.   How would its actual value be established? Any sale of theasset at or above the necessary value during the 20-yearperiod should absolve the government of paying the principalon the security. If no such sale occurred, then anyarm's-length sale within the three years preceding maturitywould be conclusive. Absent such a sale, the holder of thesecurity who believed that the government owed money to himcould establish that fact by requesting, at his expense, agovernment appraisal of the value of the connected asset. Ifwould not be necessary for the security holder to own theconnected asset.   In my opinion, the occasions for government payment wouldbe rare. If some skeptics do not share my faith in rising RTCasset values (now very depressed) or in the march ofinflation, the 20-year period could be extended to 30 or even40 years. Extensions of time would provide greater assuranceagainst the payment of principal but would requirecommensurate interest payments over a longer period.   The purchasers of the asset and security package from theRTC would be getting a fair value -- an asset guaranteed bythe government to rise in value and, in addition, interestpayments for a period of years. The purchaser would havecomplete freedom to sell all or part of his investment. Thegovernment would obtain the necessary cash to pay offdepositors now while also profiting from the appreciation ofassets it has sold.   Most important, the government would be able to raise themoney to cover the shortfall the RTC is now experiencingwithout, in all likelihood, having to pay it back. Since thisshortfall may well be in the hundreds of billions of dollars,my proposal would save that amount over the costs oftraditional government financing.   I have written to the RTC Oversight Board to suggest thatthe board do some creative thinking to &quot;make a market&quot; forRTC assets. The members' response, while thoughtful,basically rested on the belief that there currently exists ahealthy market for RTC assets. Recent news stories show thatbelief may be crumbling. Moreover, there appears to be someskepticism regarding the wisdom of any enhancements,primarily due to the negative reactions to the December 1988Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corporation deals.   The RTC has set asset sales for the next few months. Myguess is that if the assets, particularly the real estateassets, are sold at all, they will go for distressed prices.And nothing very creative is planned to save the taxpayer.Mr. Seidman has been quoted as saying that if there is nosale at lower prices, then &quot;we scratch our heads.&quot;   It is not uncommon for the seller of an apartment oroffice building to guarantee the buyer a year or two of fulloccupancy when the buyer has doubts about near-term prospectsbut confidence in the more distant future. Such enhancementsare not giveaways, but simply a private-sector method forcreating a market. We need to do the same.   ---   Sen. Roth (R., Del.) is a member of the Banking Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
