It is interesting that these proponents are academics rather than people who have to make their living trading in the market every day.    If you find that a certain trader is continuously successful, you begin to emulate his or her trades rather than study the market and the issues and make your own decisions. As a result, Ivan Boesky was forced to split his trades among brokers and try to fool his followers. Does this sound like he is increasing market efficiency? Is it an efficient market when the players have vastly unequal access to information that is part of a client relationship?    &quot;Risk arbitrage&quot; is a misnomer when big traders know, through investment bankers or lawyers, that deals are in progress. Dennis Levine took unfair and unethical advantage of confidential information and Mr. Boesky eliminated, rather than shouldered, risk, by acting upon it. It is the small traders who then are bearing risk far beyond the corresponding reward. When risk does not increase with the reward, the market is not efficient.    Does Michael Jensen of Harvard University believe that leaks of economic data (such as from the Commerce Department before the market opens) or knowledge of a defense contract award improves market efficiency? Should certain people know this information before others and morally act upon it? What happened to fairness? The SEC's insider-trading laws are appropriate. The agency protects not only the efficiency of the market, but its integrity also.    Renee M. Rady   New York</TEXT></DOC>
