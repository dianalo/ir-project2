The Swiss chemical giant more than doubled itsanti-pollution spending last year to 1.3 billion Swiss francs($935 million). Chairman Alex Krauer opened company factoriesto public visits, installed a hotline to reassure worriedneighbors and declared himself ready for dialogue. WhenGreenpeace activists climbed a company smokestack, Mr. Krauerinvited the trespassers to his office for coffee and cake.</LP><TEXT>   But today, Ciba-Geigy finds itself under attack from thesame environmentalists it tried to woo. Stiff opposition hasfoiled its plans to build a biotechnology research instituteand a waste incinerator. An angered Mr. Krauer has begunthreatening to move the company's headquarters out ofSwitzerland.   &quot;There are days where you are just fed up,&quot; laments UrsGujer, the company's vice president for environmentalaffairs. &quot;We tried to do the right thing. We consulted witheverybody, we picked the most environmentally sound projects,the ones which would leave the least contamination -- andlook what happens.&quot;   Throughout Europe, companies of all kinds are rushing torespond to stricter legislation and increased public concernabout the environment -- only to confront an obstacle courseof often contradictory choices. Chemical producers typicallyfind themselves on the front lines in this battle. No matterhow great an effort they make, it seems, they can't shaketheir reputation as polluters and sources of seriousaccidents.   Here at the home of Switzerland's three large chemicalcompanies, the environmentalists attacking Ciba-Geigy compareits cleanup efforts favorably with those of its neighbors,Sandoz Ltd. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. But as Ciba-Geigy'sexperiences illustrate, efforts aimed at showing sensitivityto environmental concerns can sometimes bring not only praisebut also added scrutiny and criticism.   &quot;It's terrible to say, but if they had just gone aheadwith their two projects without saying anything, theyprobably never would have faced any problems,&quot; says GuyMorin, an independent member of the local Basel legislature.   Dealing with the environment poses delicate questionsabout finance as well as about politics and public image.&quot;Environmentally safe growth will be one of the big issues ofthe 1990s,&quot; says Sumantra Ghoshal of the INSEAD businessschool in Fontainebleau, France. &quot;The question is whetherit's better to spend $100 million on a new plant to reducepollution and please the `greenies' or forgo the expense andplease the stock analysts.&quot;   Public sentiment often demands that businesses face up tothis question. For this sedate Swiss city of 200,000 people,where the chemical factories' smokestacks tower over medievalhalf-timbered houses, the real awakening came Nov. 1, 1986,when a devastating fire broke out at the Sandoz warehouse innearby Schweizerhalle. By the time the blaze subsided, morethan 30 tons of mercury and pesticides had poured into theRhine River.   Since the disaster, all three of Basel's chemical giantshave increased anti-pollution spending, to the point wheresafety and environmental-protection costs now account formore than one-fifth of their total outlays.   At Schweizerhalle, for example, Sandoz is spending 40million Swiss francs to build a 1,250-square-meter(13,500-square-foot) water-retention basin. Now, water usedto fight a chemical fire wouldn't spill directly into thenearby Rhine, carrying pollutants with it; instead, the waterwould be caught in the basin and purified before beingdischarged.   &quot;You have to be ahead of the laws to show people youreally care,&quot; explains Armin Hofstetter of Hoffmann-LaRoche's Sisseln plant, where a $17 million water-retentionand cleaning system has just become operational. &quot;We're proudto say that the water we send back into the Rhine is cleanerthan the water we take out.&quot;   Although all three Swiss chemical companies are takingmore precautions, their efforts are perceived differently bythe public. Ciba-Geigy has been widely praised for beingopen, forthright and friendly, while environmentalistscriticize rival Sandoz for being closed, secretive andantagonistic. Hoffmann-La Roche tries to keep a low profile,emphasizing how it produces mostly drugs, not chemicals.   These differing public images stem, in large part, fromthe personalities of the chief executives. Ciba-Geigy's Mr.Krauer is a popular hometown personality who participates inmany Basel activities and impresses locals as a warm andgenerous man. Sandoz is led by Marc Moret, a businessman fromFribourg in the French-speaking section of Switzerland. Mr.Moret is uncomfortable speaking German in public and spendsmost of his free time out of town.   &quot;Whenever I see Krauer in public, he seems to care, towant dialogue,&quot; says Jorg Stochlin, a Green Party member ofthe local parliament. &quot;Moret, in comparison, is stiff andsilent.&quot;   Ciba-Geigy managers have been authorized to take personalinitiatives in dealing with environmental issues. WernerRothweiler recounts how he stopped production of a red dyeused in automobile lacquers, overruling pleas of marketingexecutives.   &quot;The stuff was so loaded with sulfur that it would havecost a fortune to treat the waste,&quot; Mr. Rothweiler explains.&quot;Marketing people said: `But it's so beautiful. What will ourcustomers say?' I told them, `You shouldn't only think interms of turnover and profit.'&quot; Reassuring the public isanother Ciba-Geigy priority. Hans-Rudolf Hitz, theenvironmental-safety director at the company's Basel plant,explains how he started a monthly newspaper to inform localsof factory plans.   In contrast, Sandoz managers take a much dimmer view ofenvironmental protests. Company officials, for example,turned away the uninvited Greenpeace guests. &quot;They justshowed up and demanded to see me,&quot; says Hans Winkler, thecompany's executive in charge of environmental matters. &quot;Weare busy businessmen.&quot;   Such attitudes have soured Sandoz's relations with localresidents, but so far the company has remained almost immuneto attacks by environmentalists. When activists recentlytried to oppose the construction of a laboratory where workis now done on a drug called Sandimun, executives threatenedto move their investment overseas -- along with the jobs itrepresented. The complaints were quickly dropped.   Ciba-Geigy's cooperative attitude, by contrast, hasresulted in protracted litigation for the company. In 1987,it requested a building permit for an $80 million incineratorto burn toxic wastes. Instead of shipping the waste abroad --a dangerous and politically unacceptable process -- theproject would permit the company to dispose the waste athome. An environmental-impact study was carried out, andSwiss authorities approved the project.   &quot;We took the lead on the issue, because we thought thiswas the most responsible position,&quot; says Mr. Gujer, theproject's director. &quot;It was part of our strategy of saying,`OK, we have a problem. Let's deal with it.'&quot;   Worried residents, both at home and in neighboring WestGermany, saw only the problem. They hired Reinhold Zweidler,a lawyer active in environmental affairs. He criticizes theincinerator's &quot;outdated&quot; technology and its planned location,near populated neighborhoods. Ciba-Geigy, which responds thatthe incinerator needs to be placed near production sites, hasheld public meetings with neighborhood residents to get itspoint across.   Last December, city officials dismissed the critics'complaints. Mr. Zweidler appealed the decision and says hewill take the case all the way to the Swiss Supreme Court. Heconcedes that he will probably lose, but adds that the entireprocess could take three or four years. That delay annoysCiba-Geigy officials. &quot;The critics have no crediblealternative,&quot; Mr. Rothweiler complains. &quot;All they want is todrag it out so long as to cause us problems.&quot;   Nevertheless, Ciba-Geigy officials insist that they willstick to their policy of dialogue and openness. &quot;We're not atthe end of the day yet,&quot; says Gottfried Eigenmann,Ciba-Geigy's director of environmental affairs. In the longrun, &quot;a company which is reckless with the environment willpay.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
