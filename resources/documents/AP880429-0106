He was the firstEuropean settler to be killed in this French Pacific islandterritory since the latest wave of separatist violence began a weekago.   Separatist guerrillas who kidnapped 23 lawmen freed an assistantprosecutor and ordered him to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists.   The killing of Jose Lapetite, 31, on his farm on New Caledonia'swest coast brings to seven the number of deaths since Melanesianseparatists attacked a police station April 22 on the island ofOuvea. All of the victims until now have been either gendarmes ornative Melanesians.   Lapetite's brother, Jean-Claude, said he heard shots fired fromthe bush about midday but did not see the assailants.   Lapetite's father, Raoul Petite, 62, was reported missing afterthe attack and believed kidnapped by the gunmen, but he was foundat his home, said friends of the family who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Raoul and Jose Lapetite and three other brothers were implicatedin the Dec. 5, 1984, killing of 10 Melanesian separatists inHienghene, on the island's east coast.   Among those killed were two brothers of Jean-Marie Tjibaou,chief of the Kanak Socialist Liberation Front, a political movementseeking independence from France.   Seven European settlers accused of the attack, including theLapetites, were acquitted by a court in Noumea last October.   Native Melanesians, who make up 43 percent of the territory's145,000 people, are known as Kanaks. Many of them desireindependence.   About 36 percent of New Caledonians are European, with the restprimarily Asian or Tahitian. Most of the population wants to remainunder French control.   Assistant prosecutor Jean Bianconi was released from a cave onthe island of Ouvea and told to pursue negotiations with Frenchauthorities. Bianconi was the second hostage in two days releasedto mediate.   On Thursday, Capt. Philippe Legorjus, chief of the Frenchanti-terrorism force, flew by helicopter to talk to Frenchauthorities in Fayaoue, a village on Ouvea, an island of thenortheast coast of New Caledonia.   The kidnappers threatened to kill their remaining hostages ifthe men did not return to the rebel hideout, a system of caves 110miles north of Noumea.   Legorjus, Bianconi and five police officers were seized by theseparatists Wednesday as they sought to negotiate the release ofthe 15 lawmen kidnapped on April 22.   The hostages were among 27 people abducted in a bloody attack ata police station that left four gendarmes dead. Twelve of thosehostages later were freed.   The attack was aimed at halting Sunday's French presidentialelections on the island.   Also on Thursday, Bernard Pons, minister for overseasterritories, said in Noumea that he has asked the government tooutlaw the Kanak front.   In Paris, Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac referred to theKanak front as a ``terrorist faction'' that does not represent theNew Caledonian population.   ``I will do everything so that this group is reduced,'' Chiracsaid during a televised debate with Socialist President FrancoisMitterrand, his rival in presidential runoff elections May 8.   ``What counts today is the liberation of the gendarmes andjudicial offical,'' Mitterrand said. ``But what counts tomorrow isdialogue.''   Yeiwene Yeiwene, the No. 2 leader in the Kanak political group,said banning the organization ``would not settle the crisis in NewCaledonia and will not stop the Kanak people from taking the fightfor independence to its end.''   An estimated 4,000 French troops and gendarmes are in NewCaledonia.   The kidnappers demanded police reinforcements be removed fromthe islands. They asked that mediators be sent from Paris todiscuss a new referendum on self-determination.</TEXT></DOC>
