Unlike America's other racial minorities such asAfrican-Americans, Hispanics and American Indians,Asian-Americans have not established themselves as acivil-rights force. Perhaps this reveals why the castingissue in the Broadway show &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; has received so muchattention. In the absence of other Asian-American activists,these protesters have a monopoly on media coverage.</LP><TEXT>   All minorities face different situations that need to bedealt with individually. Ms. Chu feels the need to look atproblems unique to Asians such as college admissions and thedefining of what &quot;Asian-American&quot; means. This is exactly thekind of discussion that Asian-Americans need to participatein. As for my situation, I am a student at the University ofChicago, which has a high percentage of Asians.
