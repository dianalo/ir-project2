X-ray diffraction and optical or electron microscopeanalysis was conducted by NIOSH and two independent laboratories. Alllaboratories confirmed the presence of asbestiform tremolite and anthophyllitein the bulk talc samples at concentrations of 67 to 88 and 4 to 12%,respectively. Time-weighted average (TWA) values for fiber and dust personalexposures for almost 30 job categories ranged from 1.7 to 9.8 fibersgreater than 5 microns per cubic centimeter, and 0.25 to 2.96 milligramsper cubic meter, respectively. Free silica exposures were very low. Analysisof the impinger samples revealed excessive exposure to asbestos at almostevery mine and mill operation. The authors conclude that excessive exposuresto airborne fibers exist in both mine and mill. Recommendations includeimproved ventilation, upgraded equipment maintenance, and provision ofrespiratory protection to employees.</TEXT></DOC>
