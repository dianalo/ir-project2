Reilly said it was the first time China had released suchdetailed statistics.   China's last public estimates of the panda population were madein 1976 _ about 1,000 animals. Another survey is under way thisyear, and results have been announced only for the Wolong NaturePreserve _ 145 animals in 1976, 72 now.   Chinese authorities up to now have said poaching at beencontrolled, though the possibility of the death penalty forpoachers was announced last fall, the fund said.   Forestry Minister Gao Dezhan announced the arrest statistics inFebruary. He reportedly said 150 people still were sought inconnection with an investigation into poaching and fur trading inSichuan Province in western China, where almost all pandas live.   Twenty-six people have been sentenced to prisons terms rangingfrom a year to life, Dezhan was quoted as saying.   Some pandas are believed caught in snares set for anotherendangered species, the Asian musk deer, whose oil is valued intraditional Asian medicine.   Panda furs fetch high prices when smuggled to Hong Kong or Japan.   Spokesman Ken Cook said a fund representative, Chris Elliott,saw accounts of Dezhan's speech in a Beijing newspaper on Feb. 27,but had been traveling and unable to confirm the figures withChinese officials until recently.   The panda is a shy mammal that looks like a black-and-white bearbut is believed by many zoologists _ not all _ to be closelyrelated to the raccoon. It has been known to be under severe strainas its forest habitat retreated under farming pressure.   The panda eats only certain kinds of bamboo found in the forest.   So little was known about the panda that it was not classifiedas an endangered species until 1984.   The fund said it was renewing its Ferbuary request to the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service to deny import permits for short-termexhibitions of pandas in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit and Toledothis year.   David Klinger, spokesman for the service, said applications hadbeen received only from organizations in Detroit and Toledo.   The service, he said, will make no decisions on the permitsuntil it gets information from the Chinese government on whetherthe exhibitions affect the population in the wild and the captivebreeding population in Chinese zoos and whether rental paymentsfrom the exhibitions are being used to benefit the species.</TEXT></DOC>
