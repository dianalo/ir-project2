The movement is more diverse and has a lower profile than whenRalph Nader led 250 students from the country's top schools toWashington to research what, if anything, government was doing forconsumers, advocates say. But they contend that the movement isevery bit as strong and influential.   ``It's not as visible, it's not as much here but it's spreadinto the hustings,'' said Robert Fellmeth, one of seven lawyersdubbed ``Nader's Raiders'' in January 1969.   They earned the tag after presenting a well-documented report ofinaction by the Federal Trade Commission, which then had primaryresponsibility for consumer protection.   The proliferation of consumer advocacy organizations since thenis a testament to the health of their movement, says veteran raiderClarence Ditlow.   ``We're almost as big and varied as the government,'' saidDitlow, who heads the Center for Auto Safety, which has lead thefight for standard safety features such as seat belts and air bagsin cars and whose annual car report has become a mainstay forbuyers.   Nader's Raiders and their associates have founded or helped toestablish more than 35 different consumer advocacy groups,according to a statement distributed at a recent 20th anniversaryconference.   Fellmeth, a law professor at the University of San Diego, saidthat in its infancy the movement focused on direct political andlegislative action at the federal level.   The advocates acknowledge they made few advances after RonaldReagan was elected president in 1980, being forced instead toprotect the statutes and agencies they had helped create againsthis anti-government philosophy.   ``We could not have envisioned Reagan putting the 1980s on holdwhile he built a government of the Exxon, by the GM, for theDuponts,'' said Nader in a wry parody of the Constitution'spreamble.   Consumer activists say legislation is needed to renew andstrengthen the mandate of the Consumer Product Safety Commission,which has not been reauthorized by Congress since its 1972inception.   While calling for a stronger federal hand, groups have shiftedmuch of their emphasis to the state and local level.   ``It's begun to have a grass-roots kind of entity and it's nowbegun to spread into state capitals and it's become more of adirect democracy,'' said Fellmeth at the recent Raider reunion.   ``I think you're going to be seeing the consequences of thatgroundwork in the 1990s,'' predicted Fellmeth.   Some point to stricter state than federal laws againstpesticides on foods, state consumer utility boards, consumerrepresentation on public utility commissions and programs likeFlorida's time dollar-service exchange as harbingers of the futureefforts.   Health care, on the other hand, has the highest priority on thenational consumer agenda, the activists say. Issues to be resolvedare who delivers it, who makes treatment decisions, how to controlcosts and how to provide long-term and catastrophic care.   Nader and others say there also needs to be a greater push forgroup buying associations and publicly-financed, possibly elected,consumer representation before federal and state regulatoryagencies.   Nader also points out that publicly-financed campaigns and anend to honoraria for elected officials remain on the agenda.   Still others, like Chuck Hill of the Consumer Law Center andMark Silberfeld of Consumers Union, say more emphasis will have tobe put on the concerns of low-income people.   Meanwhile, traditional consumer organizations have alliedthemselves with adversaries on specific issues.   Consumer Federation of America and the U.S. Public InterestResearch Group recently joined with the Association of AmericanTrial Lawyers to warn the public about a potentially dangerousdrain cleaner. The American Insurers Association has joined withseveral consumers groups and is bankrolling the newly-createdAdvocates for Highway and Auto Safety.   These ``shifting coalitions,'' as Silberfeld termed them, are apart of a more sophisticated approach that consumer advocates arelikely to continue.</TEXT></DOC>
