In fact, the commonwealth's use of contracted services reflects the application of sound business practices to state government, and the reforms we have initiated in this area are a strong example of our aggressive, hands-on approach to management.    In this area, as in others, the Dukakis administration has built a strong record of fiscal and managerial excellence. Our proven management record has permitted us to expand state services, and launch dozens of successful new programs, such as our revenue-enforcement and welfare-reform initiatives, generating $1.5 billion from tax scofflaws and $100 million in welfare savings and enabling us to cut taxes by more than $700 million. And Massachusetts, unlike virtually every state, has not increased a broad-based tax in more than 12 years.    As a consequence, our total tax and fee burden, as a percentage of personal income, was the eighth lowest of all states in 1985. Recently Massachusetts' solid performance has been rewarded by an upgrading of the state's credit rating by Moody's and Standard andamp; Poor's. Standard andamp; Poor's attributed its upgrade in part to the commonwealth's &quot;strong fiscal management&quot; and our introduction of &quot;procedures to ensure continuing financial stability.&quot;    As every manager knows, blind pursuit of the lowest price for a service does not yield the best results at the lowest true cost. Your story cites &quot;savings&quot; we could have achieved by selecting low bidders, for instance, in a contract to respond to spills of hazardous wastes. In such cases, we stand by the decision to select providers on the basis of track record and documented abilities, as well as price.    In the area of contracted services, we have in the past several years implemented major reforms to strengthen state practices. We have instituted a centralized annual review of every contracted service. We have promulgated clear, uniform standards for when use of contracted services is appropriate. We have tightened the competitive requirements for procurement of contracted services. And we have reduced contracted positions by 1,600, where our review indicated that use of contracting was no longer warranted.    More generally, we have instituted state of the art systems that have brought our Medicaid error rate from one of the highest to one of the lowest rates in the nation. And our expenditure reporting and payment system is a model for other states.    Massachusetts' state government is a large and complex system, delivering more than $11 billion in goods and services to the six million residents of the state.    We have made great progress in managing state government well over the past five years, and we will continue to do so in the future.    Frank T.
