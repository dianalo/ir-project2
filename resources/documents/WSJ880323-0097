Before the chip invasion, the mechanical components of a product gave industrial designers a diversity of shapes to work with. A record player, for example, has a conspicuous turntable, tone arm and changing mechanism. By contrast, a CD player, with its shrunken disk hidden away in a drawer, is basically a box of circuit boards. That's why CD players, computers and other electronic products tend to look monotonously alike.    But some companies and their designers have been breaking the curse. One way has been with &quot;product semantics&quot; -- using the object's meaning rather than its innards to define form. And while laboratory test equipment might seem an unlikely genre for ground-breaking design, a new time-measuring unit by Wave Technologies Corp., a privately held company in Edina, Minn., is an excellent example of how high tech can send a lively message.    Dennis J. Leisz, Wave president, says the time-measuring unit is the most sensitive stopwatch made, able to measure how long it takes a beam of light to travel a distance equal to the thickness of a hair. Applications include testing computer chips, radar transmitters and lasers.    Mr. Leisz says he wanted a &quot;leading-edge look.&quot; According to Bob Worrell, president of Worrell Design Inc., Minneapolis, which designed the unit, &quot;Nobody had ever heard of Wave Technologies. He needed to capture attention.&quot;    Mr. Worrell began with a semantic study, &quot;looking at the qualities we wanted to demonstrate,&quot; and soon focused on the wave form. &quot;The unit measures waves, and Wave is the company's name,&quot; he says.    If Mr. Worrell has any concerns, it's that the product may be &quot;overdesigned&quot; for a laboratory full of conventional-looking equipment. &quot;It may look too much like a consumer product,&quot; he says.    But the unit's distinctive appearance suits Mr. Leisz's purposes. &quot;We didn't even put our name on it,&quot; he says. &quot;You look at it and you know immediately who built it.&quot;    Honest, Doc, This   Won't Hurt a Bit   SURGEONS LIKE to say their hands are worth a million dollars. So it's understandable that they would be skittish about plunging their arms up to the elbows into a whooshing machine.    That presented a problem for the design engineers at Pacific Biosystems Inc., in Phoenix, who were developing a machine to wash a surgeon's hands in 90 seconds -- the traditional hand-and-brush technique takes five to 10 minutes -- and get rid of more bacteria. The process, using a spray of water, anti-bacterial chemicals and air, is automatic; the surgeon simply pokes his arms into two holes in the Stat Scrub machine and steps on a pedal.    There's the rub. According to Francis S. Keery, president of Pacific Biosystems, physicians and nurses who tested a prototype balked at sticking their arms into the holes. To overcome their uneasiness, designers put a clear plastic lid on the wash chamber, so the doctors could keep an eye on their precious fingers. They also banished all moving parts from the chamber, found a more comfortable material for cuffs that line the arm holes and tapered the front plane of the machine to reduce its bulk.    Mr. Keery says the machine, which was introduced last month, has been popular at three hospitals where it is being tested. Other models have also been developed for the food industry and for day-care centers.    Frat Funds Designs   For the Handicapped   AN ODD GROUP of benefactors -- including the Pi Kappa Phi college fraternity -- is working to provide better environments for severely handicapped children.    The group works through PUSH Inc., a nonprofit venture based in Morganton, N.C. Its most recent project is a bedroom for a 14-year-old named Justin who has cerebral palsy. It's a prototype that PUSH hopes eventually to make available to other children for use in their own homes.    According to D. James Firster, PUSH executive director, Justin's bedroom is designed to increase his independence. Among its features are special switches that he can operate with his fist to activate a television set and even open and close his door, cubbyholes around the bed that hold a week's supply of clothing, special closets, a wheelchair desk and a transfer system that allows him to move unaided between his bed and wheelchair.    PUSH got its start about 10 years ago, when Thomas Sayre, a sculptor, obtained the fraternity's support in fund raising in his efforts to design, build and donate special furniture and play modules for institutions that house severely handicapped children. In time it broadened its scope to include designing the hospital rooms and other spaces where the equipment will be used. </TEXT></DOC>
