SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   North Korea and Cuba are the world worstviolators of human rights because they have established systems of``total repression,'' a top State Department official said today.   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Schifter offered thatassessment on the occasion of the release of the State Department'sannual human rights report, which strikes a positive note about theSoviet Union but harsh criticism about Israel.   Schifter, who heads the State Department's human rights bureau,said under questioning that his assessment, consistent with previousyears, is that Cuba and North Korea are the world's most repressivestates.   ``What we are talking about here is total repression,'' Schiftersaid.   In North Korea, he said, the government ``tries really to turnpeople into automatons.''   ``As far as Cuba is concerned, there is an effort there to try toachieve the same thing in terms of total penetration of the countryby secret police truly spying on every citizen,'' he said.   The human rights report's section on the Soviet Union saidPresident Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms offer ``cautious hope for abetter day.''   But it says the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and GazaStrip led to a ``substantial increase'' in human rights violationsby Israeli authorities last year.   It said the actions of Israeli authorities ``resulted in manyavoidable deaths'' among Palestinians since they began theiruprising 14 months ago. Since the December 1987 start of theuprising, 374 Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded,most by Israeli army gunfire.   In Jerusalem, Israel rejected key conclusions of the report andsaid it ignored the context of a violent civilian uprising byPalestinians.   A Foreign Ministry statement disputed the report's claim thatsoldiers who opened fire unnecessarily on Arabs were given lenientsentences and in some cases not punished at all.   ``In spite of the constant provocations, the Israel Defense Forcescrupulously maintains moral norms and human rights, and treats anyexceptions with utmost severity,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said.   Discussing the Soviet Union, the report cited Gorbachev'spolicies of glasnost and perestroika _ aimed at encouraging publicdiscussion of national problems and the restructuring of thestagnant government and economy _ with achieving ``a major impact''on the communist system.   But it also pointed out that ``powerful and pervasive'' forcesare at work to defeat Gorbachev's reforms and that ``individualguarantees to protect the rights of the individual against unbridledstate authority are still needed.''   The report, which was released Tuesday, said it is premature tocontend that a ``fundamental shift'' in Soviet policy has occurred,but added that ``the changes in evidence in 1988 have profoundimplications, as advocates of significant systemic reform appear tohave gained strength.''   The report said prisoners detained on religious or politicalgrounds have been released and that plans for the amendment orrepeal of statutes limiting activities in these areas have beenannounced.   In addition, freedom the leave the Soviet Union temporarily hasbeen expanded, it said. It cited increased emigration for Armenians,ethnic Germans, Jews and Pentecostals.   ``Plans have been adopted for elections which, though notcompletely free and open, are no longer to be the farce they havebeen heretofore,'' the report said.   As ``the most significant development,'' the report noted thatthe abuse of psychiatry has been made a punishable offense and thatmental hospitals have been far less likely to confine persons forpolitical or religious reasons.   ``The recognition of the need for action to secure the rights ofindividuals, and the fact that the defects of the existing systemare, now openly discussed, offer a basis for cautious hope of abetter day,'' the report said.   The State Department has been issuing the annual reports sincethe mid-1970s. This year's survey covers conditions in 169 countriesand territories.   The report pointed to severe human rights setbacks in Iraq andthe African countries of Burundi and Sudan.   In Iraq, chemical warfare was used against Kurdish rebels,killing or injuring thousands and forcing thousands more to flee thecountry, it said. Overall, the country has an ``abysmal human rightsrecord,'' the report said.   The report indicated that perhaps the single greatestrights-related tragedy in the world occurred in southern Sudan whereit said some reports estimated that between 100,000 and 250,000civilians died of starvation.   The deaths occurred after elements of the armed forces on eachside in Sudan's civil war interfered with or failed to cooperatewith food delivery efforts.   On the positive side, the report said there were significantsteps toward democracy and human rights protection in South Korea,Taiwan and Pakistan. It also said that the October plebiscite inChile has raised hopes for a peaceful return to democracy there.</TEXT></DOC>
