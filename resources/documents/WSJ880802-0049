The staff of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has recommended selection of a joint venture between units of Arcorp Properties Inc., Weehawken, N.J., and Hartz Mountain Corp., Harrison, N.J. The selection is subject to approval by the authority's commissioners at a meeting Aug. 11.    The passengers-only service would operate weekdays during rush hours, from 7 to 10 a.m. and from 4 to 7 p.m. The initial price of a one-way ticket would be $2; monthly tickets would cut the price to $1.33.    Arthur E. Imperatore, the trucking and real-estate executive who heads Arcorp, and Leonard Stern, chairman of Hartz Mountain, a pet supplies maker, said they hoped to have the ferry service in full operation by next spring. </TEXT></DOC>
