In the fourth category, there is no needfor such proof.andP;  It will carry a maximum penalty of six months in prison.andM;Critics of Colvin's bill, while welcoming the other provisions, say that thebasic crime could inadvertently sweep in many innocent activities such asemployee misuse of word processing software.andP;  Others say the crime is, inpractical terms, unenforceable.andM;(Peter Sommer/19900210)</TEXT></DOC>
