This agreement shall not be binding until approved by the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="85">Analysis to Aid Public Comment on Consent Order Accepted Subject toFinal Approval </ITAG>The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted for public commentfrom MTH Holdings, Inc. an agreement containing a consent order. The Commissionis placing the agreement on the public record for sixty (60) days for receptionof comments from interested persons.   Comments received during this period will become part of the public record.After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement andthe comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from theagreement or make final the agreement's proposed order.   The Commission's investigation of this matter concerned the proposed acquisitionof GU Acquisition Corporation by MTH Holdings Inc. (``MTH'') and SalomonInc (``Salomon''). GU Acquisition Corporation wholly owns The Grand UnionCompany (``Grand Union''), which operates 304 retail grocery stores inthe United States. MTH holds the majority of outstanding shares of thePenn Traffic Co., which controls P andamp; C Food Markets, Inc. (``P andamp;C''), a retail grocery store chain.   The Commission has reason to believe that MTM's acquisition on Grand Unionwould substantially lessen competition in twelve towns and cities in NewYork and Vermont in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The towns and cities where competitionwould be substantially lessened include the following: Cobleskill, N.Y.;Oneonta, N.Y.; Ticonderoga, N.Y.; Barre/Montpelier/Berlin, Vt.; Bennington,Vt.; Brattleboro, Vt.; Burlington, Vt., Metropolitan Statistical Area;Manchester, Vt.; Morrisville, Vt.; Rutland, Vt. (including the North Clarendonand West Rutland areas); Springfield, Vt.; and Windsor, Vt.  The agreement containing the Consent Order (``Order'') would, if issuedby the Commission, settle the complaint that alleges anticompetitive effectsas a result of the acquisition in the twelve towns and cities listed above.  Under the terms of the proposed Order, MTH must divest one retail grocerystore presently owned or operated by either Pandamp;C or Grand Union in thefollowing towns: Cobleskill, N.Y.; Oneonta, N.Y.; Ticonderoga, N.Y.; Barre/Montpelier/Berlin,Vt.; Bennington, Vt.; Brattleboro, Vt.; Manchester, Vt.; Morrisville, Vt.;Springfield, Vt.; and Windsor, Vt. MTH must also divest two retail grocerystores presently owned or operated by either Pandamp;C or Grand Union inRutland, Vt. (including the North Clarendon and West Rutland areas) andfour retail grocery stores presently owned or operated by either Pandamp;Cor Grand Union in the Burlington, Vt.; Metropolitan Statistical Area. Underthe proposed Order, all of these divestitures, except Bennington, Vt.,must occur within nine months. The required divestiture in Bennington,Vt., must occur within twelve months.   If MTH fails to complete the required divestitures within the requiredtime period, the Commission may authorize a trustee to divest all of theretail grocery stores presently owned or operated by Grand Union in thefollowing locations: Ostego County, N.Y.; Schoharie County, N.Y.; Ticonderoga,N.Y.; Bennington County, Vt.; Chittenden County, Vt.; Lamoille County,Vt.; Rutland County, Vt.; Washington, Vt.; Windham County, Vt.; and WindsorCounty, Vt.  Under the Hold Separate Agreement, Grand Union's Northern Division mustoperate separately from the rest of the Company until all the divestituresrequired by the Commission Order have been made. The Northern Divisionconsists of 135 stores in upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire andMassachusetts, and two warehouses in Waterford, N.Y. and Waverly, N.Y.Under the Hold Separate Agreement, MTH and Salomon must form a five-personManagement Committee consisting of one member from Salomon, one memberfrom Grand Union, one member from MTH and two members from Grand Union'sNorthern Division. The Management Committee will be responsible for operatingGrand Union's Northern Division. The Management Committee does not requirepermission of either the MTH or Salomon member to make decisions for theNorthern Division.   For a period of ten (10) years from its effective date, the proposed Orderprohibits MTH and Grand Union from making substantive acquisitions of assetsor businesses that operate retail grocery stores without prior Commissionapproval.   It is anticipated that the Order would resolve the competitive problemsalleged in the Complaint. The purpose of this analysis is to invite publiccomment concerning the Order, in order to aid the Commission in its determinationof whether it should make final the Order contained in the agreement. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the agreement and Order, nor is it intended to modify the terms of theagreement and Order in any way.  <ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
