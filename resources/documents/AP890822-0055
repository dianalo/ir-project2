Stephen J. Solarz, the New York Democrat who is chairman of theHouse Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, said such amultilateral program involving the United States, Britain, Canadaand other countries would help restore confidence among Hong Kongpeople.   The 5.7 million people of this British colony have long beenconcerned about what will happen to Hong Kong when it reverts toCommunist China in eight years. Fears over the future increasedafter the Chinese military quashed the pro-democracy movement inBeijing in June.   Solarz said he envisioned a program under which Hong Kong peoplecould move permanently to a foreign country without first meetingexisting residency requirements. He said perhaps several hundredthousand local people could meet qualifying criteria set by the hostcountries for the program.   Hong Kong residents who qualify for the program would have ``theconfidence to remain here, where I think most of them would like tostay, knowing that if worse came to worse they would have theopportunity to relocate elsewhere,'' Solarz told a news conference.   He said such a program might ``give the authorities in Beijing aneven greater incentive to conduct themselves ... in a way that issensitive to the concerns of the people in Hong Kong, knowing ...that if they botch it all up when they arrive in 1997 a lot of thepeople who make Hong Kong go would no longer be around.''   Solarz said he would discuss the issue, which he described as ``akind of multilateral immigration insurance policy,'' with the Bushadministration when he returns to Washington and that he might holdhearings. He said the support of Britain would be crucial.   London has refused to grant most Hong Kong residents the right tolive in Britain but has spoken of an international relief effort ifthe situation deteriorates in the territory.   Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents have besieged localconsulates in bids to emigrate before the Chinese take over.   Solarz also said the manner in which Hong Kong deals with itsrapidly expanding population of Vietnamese boat people will helpdetermine the willingness of the international community to assistHong Kong people.   More than 50,000 Vietnamese who fled their Communist homeland byboat for this colony are now languishing in crowded Hong Kong camps.   Hong Kong continues to offer temporary refuge to all arrivingVietnamese, despite calls by many residents to scrap the policy. Thegovernment has started a screening policy, however, under whichVietnamese who cannot prove they fled persecution will be forciblysent back to their homeland once Hanoi agrees.   But Solarz said, ``It cannot be in the interest of Hong Kong ifpeople are en masse forced to return'' to Vietnam. He suggested boatpeople who are determined not eligible for refugee status be givenseveral months to volunteer to return home.</TEXT></DOC>
