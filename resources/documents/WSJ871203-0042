KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABORCHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM)TEXTILES AND APPAREL (TEX)LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two labor unions and an industry group sued the Labor Department in efforts to alter its new rules covering worker exposure to formaldehyde, a heavily used industrial chemical.    The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers and the International Ladies Garment Workers asked a federal appeals court here to order a tougher version of the regulations, which were issued late last month by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The rules, to be phased in over a year, will reduce the allowable level for workplace exposure to formaldehyde to one part per million parts of air from three parts per million.    Separately, in a federal appeals court in New Orleans, the Formaldehyde Institute, an industry trade group, challenged the part of the OSHA standard that will require labels depicting formaldehyde as a cancer-causing agent. The institute didn't oppose the basic requirements of the regulation, but it argues that there is no evidence formaldehyde causes cancer.    The unions said in a statement that the new rules virtually ignore a &quot;serious cancer risk&quot; to more than 900,000 apparel workers. The Environmental Protection Agency in April concluded that formaldehyde levels in the apparel industry, in the 0.2 to 0.3 parts per million range, will cause hundreds of cancer deaths, noted Jack Sheinkman, the president of the Textile Workers.    The new OSHA standard also won't require apparel makers to alert workers to potential cancer risks, nor provide routine examinations for skin problems or allergies common among workers handling fabrics that are treated with the chemical to make them wrinkle-resistant, said Jay Mazur, the Garment Workers president.    OSHA issued the new regulations under court orders to upgrade the existing standard after labor organizations sued.    Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman, said the new standard reflects &quot;exhaustive research&quot; by the agency, and is &quot;justified on the scientific record.&quot; OSHA officials believe the health risk for workers handling formaldehyde, including clothing workers, will be &quot;substantially eliminated&quot; by the regulations, and that the agency will be &quot;vindicated&quot; in court, Mr. Mikelsen said.    Compliance by companies that use and produce formaldehyde, he added, is &quot;well within the industry's financial capability&quot; and is technically feasible. </TEXT></DOC>
