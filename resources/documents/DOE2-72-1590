Are magnetic elements inclined with respect to the vertical?Do magnetic canopies exist and how can they be explained? What are thediameters of magnetic elements? What kinds of mass motion are presentin magnetic flux concentrations and what role do they play for theirstructure and energetics? What is the temperature in magnetic elementsand what are the underlying heating mechanisms? (author). 6 figs., 137refs.</TEXT></DOC>
