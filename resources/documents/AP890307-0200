SUBS last graf to UPDATE death toll.</HEAD><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   Road crews plowed and pedestrians trudged through the slushyremains of a snowstorm that canceled a presidential visit Tuesday inthe Northeast, disrupted Missouri's Legislature for a second day andcaused a 20-mile backup in Texas.   ``It's history now,'' meteorologist Ray Williams of the NationalWeather Service in Paducah, Ky., said of the storm blamed for 29deaths. ``Fortunately it's March and it will start turning back towarmer weather.''   Before the storm moved from the Midwest across the EasternSeaboard, it tangled the morning rush hour in Baltimore andWashington and knocked out electricity to 40,000 customers atAnnapolis, Md., and along the Eastern Shore from Georgetown, Del.,to Salisbury, Md., and thousands more in Ohio and Pennsylvania.   Utility workers battled ice, strong winds and frigid temperaturesto restore power lines. Schools closed in several states.   In Oklahoma, where up to 16 inches of snow fell, a 61-year-oldwoman who went outside to get wood for her stove apparently froze todeath as temperatures dipped into the teens Tuesday, police said.   ``She went out to get the wood in her house coat and socks andshe fell and passed out'' 40 yards from her front door, said TulsaSgt. Dick Bishop.   In Locust Grove, Okla., a pregnant woman and her husband had towade through waist-deep snow when their truck got stuck in snow onthe way to the hospital. The baby was delivered by a paramedic in anearby house.   Forecasters in Oklahoma, however, predicted a sudden rise intemperatures as high as the 80s later this week. In southernIllinois, where winds of 15 mph made temperatures in the low 30sseem like 5 to 10 degrees, highs were expected to reach the 60s bySaturday.   A backup on Interstate 35 in northern Texas prompted about 100truck drivers to park their rigs in Marietta, Okla., Police ChiefCharles Dunn said. About half needed tow trucks to get on their wayagain Tuesday, he said.   At least 450 stranded motorists spent the night in churches,homes and a high school in the tiny town of Valley View, Texas,where their plight elicited gifts of food, blankets and cots frommany of the 514 residents.   ``I've never seen an outpouring of kindness like this,'' said oneof the motorists, Donny Rohrbach from San Antonio, who spent thenight in a pew.   Sgt. Thomas Lefaivre of the Missouri State Highway Patrol saidthe main roads in the St. Louis area were open, ``but traffic wasvery heavy. The secondary roads are going to remain covered until itgets a lot warmer.''   President Bush canceled a trip to Lancaster, Pa., and Wilmington,Del. The Missouri Legislature, which called off its session the daybefore, was delayed several hours Tuesday morning.   Snowfall since the weekend accumulated to a foot or more along aswath from Ardmore, Okla., into Missouri, with 10 inches in Decatur,Ill., and up to a foot in northern Arkansas, where the collapse of280 poultry houses left up to $35 million in damage and dead birds.   Snow flurries and freezing drizzle were reported Tuesday morningas far south as Mobile, Ala.   Because of dangerous driving conditions, some schools closed inDelaware, Illinois, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington,D.C. Southern Illinois University-Carbondale shut its doors for onlythe third time in a decade.   Rain caused flooding across southern West Virginia, closing roadsin 14 counties. In Tennessee, about 120 families were forced toevacuate from along the swollen Cumberland and Harpeth rivers.   In Pennsylvania, the Monongahela River crested at 6.3 feet aboveflood stage Tuesday morning at Charleroi and also overflowed atBraddock, Elizabeth and McKeesport. ``There is some damage at theselevels, most often to warehouses or storage areas along the riverand roads,'' said weather service hydrologist Aldo Angelo.   Weather-related deaths included 12 in Missouri, seven inOklahoma, three in Maryland, two each in Alabama and Ohio, and oneeach in Arkansas, Georgia and Pennsylvania.</TEXT></DOC>
