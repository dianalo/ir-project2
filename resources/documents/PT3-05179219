More specifically, the invention      relates to a process for separating free fatty acids from triglycerides by      a process which employs a silica gel adsorbent. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The separation of many classes of compounds by selective adsorption on      molecular sieves or zeolites as well as other adsorbents is well known.      Also, various separations based on the degree of unsaturation are known,      e.g., esters of saturated fatty acids from unsaturated fatty acids with X      or Y zeolites exchanged with a selected cation from U.S. Pat. No.      4,048,205, monoethanoid fatty acids from diethanoid fatty acids with      cross-linked polystyrenes, e.g., &quot;Amberlite&quot; from U.S. Pat. No. 4,353,838.      A process for separating a mixture of triglycerides, based on the iodine      values, is shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,277,412 and 4,284,580 in which      permutite and aluminated silica gel adsorbents, respectively, can be used.      Similarly, diglycerides have been separated from triglycerides with omega      zeolites or silica as the adsorbents, as disclosed in Zinnen U.S. Pat. No.      4,770,819. The refining of oils by admixing them with magnesium silicate      to adsorb coloring matter and free fatty acids from glyceride oils is      disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,639,289. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,056,468 discloses a combination process of adsorption of      aqueous solutions on a silica gel concentration agent and subsequent      liquid-liquid extraction of lipophilic-soluble components of the adsorbed      species with a lipophilic solvent. Triglycerides and fatty acids are among      the lipophilic-soluble materials disclosed that can be isolated from      aqueous solutions; however, it is not apparent from the disclosure that      fatty acids can be separated from triglycerides by the process.      Furthermore, the disclosure relates to analytical separations not suited      for continuous bulk separations. </PAR><PAR>  In U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,765, acid-treated amorphous silica was used to      remove phospholipids and chlorophyll from glyceride oils as a method of      purifying glycerides. There is no teaching of the separation of fatty      acids from triglycerides with silica gel. </PAR><PAR>  The use of silica gel in analytical chromatographic separations with      various solvent systems is known. Particle sizes of silica gels used in      analytical separations ranges from 5 to 50 microns. Also, the removal of      various impurities from mixtures including triglycerides is known.      However, the usefulness of silica gel as an adsorbent for a bulk      separation of fatty acids from triglycerides has not been disclosed or      demonstrated. </PAR><PAR>  Illustrative of the analytical separations is Duthic et al, J. Chromatog.,      51(2) (1970) pages 319-21 in which fatty acids are isolated from      triglycerides with a solvent system of hexane/ethyl acetate/formic acid on      plates of silica gel G and developed with sulfuric acid followed by      charring in an oven at 120.degree. C. Also, silica gel was utilized in      separating polar compounds from non-polar compounds to analyze frying fats      according to a report by Wessels, Pure and Applied Chemistry, 55(8)      (1983), pages 1381-85. See also Tanaka et al, Lipids 15(10) (1980) pages      872-875. </PAR><PAR>  The invention herein can be practiced in fixed or moving adsorbent bed      systems, but the preferred system for this separation is a countercurrent      simulated moving bed system, such as described in Broughton U.S. Patent      2,985,589, incorporated herein by reference. Cyclic advancement of the      input and output streams can be accomplished by a manifolding system,      which are also known, e.g., by rotary disc valves shown in U.S. Pat. Nos.      3,040,777 and 3,422,848. Equipment utilizing these principles are      familiar, in sizes ranging from pilot plant scale (deRosset U.S. Pat. No.      3,706,812) to commercial scale in flow rates from a few cc per hour to      many thousands of gallons per hour. </PAR><PAR>  The functions and properties of adsorbents and desorbents in the      chromatographic separation of liquid components are well known, but for      reference thereto, Zinnen et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,642,397 is incorporated      herein. </PAR><PAR>  I have found an adsorbent, which, in combination with certain desorbent      liquids, will selectively adsorb all the fatty acids, mono- and      diglycerides and impurities contained in various triglyceride feed      material; the triglycerides are relatively non-adsorbed and elute as a      class near the void. Thus, the largest component of the feed, the      triglycerides are eluted as raffinate and the minor components are      adsorbed and eluted as extract by desorption with the desorbent. This      so-called rejective separation of the major component is desirable since      utilities are lower and adsorbent capacity for the adsorbed components, is      lower per unit of output product. </PAR><PAR>  I have discovered a method for separating fatty acids, including mixtures      of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, as a class, from triglycerides.      The triglycerides also may be a mixture of triglycerides, including      saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is a process for separating free fatty acids from a      feed mixture comprising free fatty acids and at least one triglyceride.      The process comprises contacting the mixture at adsorption conditions with      an adsorbent comprising an amorphous silica gel. The fatty acids are      selectively adsorbed to the substantial exclusion of the triglycerides.      Next, the fatty acids are desorbed by a liquid ketone, an ester or an      ether or a mixture thereof. Triglycerides are removed before the fatty      acids and, together with desorbent, constitute the raffinate. The      desorbent may be selected from the ketones having up to 8 carbons, e.g.,      acetone, the butanones, pentanones, hexanones, heptanones and octanones.      Specific examples of ketones useful in the process are acetone,      methylethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methylpropyl ketone, 2-hexanone,      2-heptanone, 3-heptanone, 2-octanone, etc., and mixtures thereof. Other      desorbent materials which may be used in the process for the separation of      free fatty acids and triglycerides are esters, e.g., methyl butyrate and      ethyl butyrate, and ethers, such as glyme, diglyme, ethyl ether,      methyl-t-butyl ether (MtBE), and phenyl ether. </PAR><PAR>  In another aspect of the invention, diglycerides contained in certain feeds      may be separated from both the triglycerides and the free fatty acids by      virtue of the fact that the diglycerides are less strongly adsorbed by the      silica gel, but also may be directed to the raffinate product stream and      recovered with the triglycerides and to the extract product stream in      proportionate amounts as desired, thus providing a large degree of      flexibility in formulating the products of the process. </PAR><PAR>  Other embodiments of my invention encompass details about feed mixtures,      adsorbents, desorbent materials and operating conditions all of which are      hereinafter disclosed in the following discussion of each of the facets of      the present invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 comprises the chromatographic traces of the pulse tests of Example I      showing the separation of free fatty acids, monoglycerides, diglycerides      and triglycerides with a silica gel adsorbent and 2-heptanone as      desorbent. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a plot of triglyceride purity vs. recovery for the continuous      simulated moving bed separation of Example V. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Highly unsaturated triglycerides are desirable oils for use in certain      foods such a mayonnaise, salad dressings, etc. Such triglycerides can be      produced in several ways, but an important route is via an      interesterification process wherein triglyceride oils with a low degree of      unsaturation can be upgraded by reaction with unsaturated fatty acids. The      process may be catalyzed enzymically by a positionally selective lipase      catalyst, e.g., Candida cylindracal, Aspergillis niger, Geotrichum      candidum or various species of Rhizopus. or chemically with an alkali      metal or alkaline earth metal catalyst. Such processes are disclosed, for      example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,081 (Unilever). The triglyceride fats or      oils which may be fed to the interesterification reaction include linseed      oil, soybean oil, cotton seed oil, corn oil, peanut oil, palm oil,      sunflower oil, safflower oil, canola oil, tallow, lard, olive oil or other      naturally occurring fats or oils. </PAR><PAR>  Naturally occurring fats and oils containing substantial quantities of free      fatty acids as well as triglycerides may be fed directly to the separation      process of the invention, e.g., palm oil, rice bran oil, etc. Partially      refined oils or fats such as hydrolyzed canola oil, soybean, cotton seed      or corn oil may also be used herein as the feedstock. </PAR><PAR>  The adsorbent used in the invention is silica gel, an amorphous silica      having pore diameters greater than about 7 Angstroms (.ANG.) and      preferably in the range of 22 to 150 .ANG., a surface area (BET) ranging      from 200 to 700 m.sup.2 /g, preferably 300-500 m.sup.2 /g, particle sizes      from 20 to 100 mesh (U.S.), pore volume of 0.5 to 1.2 cc/g. The water      content of the adsorbent, based on loss on ignition (LOI), is from 0 to      10% (wt.), preferably 0 to 2% (wt.). Silica gels illustrative of the range      of values set forth above include: Davisil 646 silica gel, Davisil 636      silica gel and Bead Gel, all available from Davison Division of W. R.      Grace andamp; Co and Merck 10181 silica gel. The values are set forth in the      following table. Particle size of all the listed materials is in the range      of 35-60 Mesh (U.S.). </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 1                                                          ______________________________________                                                                Surface Area                                                       Pore Size   Pore Vol.  (BET)                                        Silica Gel (.ANG.)     cc/g       m.sup.2 /g                                   ______________________________________                                         Davisil 646                                                                               150         1.15       300                                          Davisil 636                                                                               60          0.75       480                                          Merck 10181                                                                               40          0.68       675                                          Bead Gel   22          0.45       800                                          ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAL>  Davisil 636 is preferred in the separation because of its greater capacity.      The adsorbents used in the invention are inert and have no exchangeable      ions. The pore sizes are also large enough to enable passage by      diglycerides in order to eliminate some or all of the diglycerides from      the non-adsorbed triglyceride raffinate product; in this regard, pore      diameters of zeolites are too small to be useful. </PAL><PAR>  The water content of the adsorbent affects the separation capacity and      exchange rates and may also affects its stability. Acceptable levels of      water in the adsorbent in terms of LOI are from 0 to 10% (wt.), preferably      from 0-2% (wt.) To reduce water content to the desired level, the      adsorbent may be dried, e.g., at 80.degree. C. in vacuum or 175.degree. C.      in nitrogen gas or at atmospheric conditions. </PAR><PAR>  Other sources of adsorbent deactivation may be the monoglycerides present      in the feed or impurity amounts of glycerol, but these may be removed by      washing the adsorbent with 2-heptanone. </PAR><PAR>  The general scheme for the rejective adsorption separation such as      practiced here is known. Briefly, the less adsorbed feed component(s) is      eluted from the non-selective void volume and weakly adsorbing volume      before the more strongly adsorbed component(s). The relatively unadsorbed      component(s) is thereby recovered in the raffinate. A particular advantage      of such a system lies where the unadsorbed fraction or component is large      in relation to the other fraction or components, since substantially less      adsorbent and smaller sized equipment are required for a given feed      throughput than if the large fraction is selectively adsorbed on the      adsorbent. </PAR><PAR>  Although both liquid and vapor phase operations can be used in many      adsorptive separation processes, liquid-phase operation is preferred for      this process because of the lower temperature requirements and because of      the higher yields of extract product that can be obtained with      liquid-phase operation over those obtained with vapor phase operation.      Adsorption conditions include a temperature range of from about 25.degree.      C. to about 200.degree. C. with about 50.degree. C. to about 100.degree.      C. being preferred and a pressure sufficient to maintain liquid-phase,      ranging from about atmospheric to about 400 psig, with from about      atmospheric to about 200 psig usually being adequate. Desorption      conditions include the same range of temperatures and pressures as used      for adsorption conditions. </PAR><PAR>  At least a portion of the raffinate stream, which contains the concentrated      mixed triglycerides product, and preferably at least a portion of the      extract stream, from the separation process are passed to separation      means, typically fractionators or evaporators, where at least a portion of      desorbent material is separated to produce a raffinate product and an      extract product, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  The desorbent material for the preferred isothermal, isobaric, liquid-phase      operation of the process of my invention comprises a low molecular weight      ketone having from 3-8 carbon atoms, an ether or an ester. The ketones      include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methylbutyl ketone,      2-heptanone, 3-heptanone, dipropyl ketone, 2-octanone, 3-octanone, etc.      The most preferred desorbent materials are the ketones which are listed as      acceptable for food use, e.g., 2-heptanone, 3-heptanone and acetone. The      esters include methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methyl amylate, ethyl      amylate, etc. The ethers include ethyl ether, methyl-t-butyl ether, phenyl      ether, 3-methoxyhexane, anisole, glyme, diglyme, etc. The esters and      ethers may have up to about 8 carbon atoms, due to boiling point      restrictions. </PAR><PAR>  A dynamic testing apparatus is employed to test various adsorbents with a      particular feed mixture and desorbent material to measure the adsorption      characteristics of retention, capacity and exchange rate. The standard      apparatus consists of a helical adsorbent chamber of approximately 70 cc      volume having inlet and outlet portions at opposite ends of the chamber.      The chamber is contained within a temperature control means and, in      addition, pressure control equipment is used to operate the chamber at a      constant predetermined pressure. Quantitative and qualitative analytical      equipment such as refractometers, polarimeters and chromatographs can be      attached to the outlet line of the chamber and used to detect      qualitatively, or determine quantitatively, one or more components in the      effluent stream leaving the adsorbent chamber. A pulse test, performed      using this apparatus and the following general procedure, is used to      determine data, e.g., selectivity, for various adsorbent systems. The      adsorbent is placed in a chamber and filled to equilibrium with a      particular desorbent material by passing the desorbent material through      the adsorbent chamber. At a convenient time, a pulse of feed containing      known concentrations of a tracer and of a particular extract component or      of a raffinate component or both, all diluted in desorbent material is      injected for a duration of several minutes. Desorbent material flow is      resumed, and the tracer and the extract component or the raffinate      component (or both) are eluted as in a liquid-solid chromatographic      operation. The effluent can be analyzed on-stream, or, alternatively,      effluent samples can be collected periodically and later analyzed      separately by analytical equipment and traces of the envelopes or      corresponding component peaks developed. </PAR><PAR>  From information derived from the test, adsorbent performance can be rated      in terms of void volume, retention volume for an extract or a raffinate      component, the rate of desorption of an extract component from the      adsorbent and selectivity. The retention volume of an extract or a      raffinate component may be characterized by the distance between the      center of the peak envelope of the extract or raffinate component and the      center of the peak envelope of the tracer component (void volume) or some      other known reference point. It is expressed in terms of the volume in      cubic centimeters of desorbent material pumped during this time interval      represented by the distance between the peak envelopes. The rate of      exchange or desorption rate of an extract component with the desorbent      material can generally be characterized by the width of the peak envelopes      at half intensity. The narrower the peak width, the faster the desorption      rate. Selectivity, .beta., is determined by the ratio of the net retention      volumes of the more strongly adsorbed component to each of the other      components. </PAR><PAR>  The examples shown below are intended to further illustrate the process of      this invention without unduly limiting the scope and spirit of said      process. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE I </PAC><PAR>  A pulse test as described above was performed to evaluate the process of      the present invention for separating free fatty acids, monoglycerides,      diglycerides and triglycerides, except that in this test a 35 cc column      was used to reduce the volume throughput of desorbent. The column was      filled with 35 cc of silica gel (Davisil 636 from W. R. Grace andamp; Co.) and      maintained at a temperature of 37.degree. C. and a pressure sufficient to      provide liquid-phase operations. Flow volumes reported below were doubled      to be comparable to the standard 70 cc column. </PAR><PAR>  Separate pulses of a mixture of the desorbent and the individual components      making up a simulated or typical interesterification reaction product were      fed to the pulse test apparatus, in sequence. The simulated      interesterification reaction product components were safflower oil (mainly      triglycerides), distearin, monostearin and hydrolyzed canola oil (free      fatty acids). Each pulse consisted of 2 cc of a 2% (vol.) concentration of      the component in the desorbent. The hydrolyzed canola oil is a mixture of      free fatty acids having the composition in Table 2. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 2                                                          ______________________________________                                         Hydrolyzed Canola Oil                                                          Fatty Acid Component                                                                              %                                                           ______________________________________                                         C:14:0             0.1                                                         C14:1              Trace                                                       C16:0 (palmitic acid)                                                                             3.6                                                         C16:1              0.2                                                         C18:0 (stearic acid)                                                                              2                                                           C18:1              57.1                                                        C18:1 trans        2.9                                                         C18:2 (linoleic acid)                                                                             19.8                                                        C18:2              0.2                                                         C18:3              1.2                                                         C18:3              6.7                                                         C18:3              1.2                                                         C20:0              0.5                                                         C20:1              1.5                                                         C22:0              0.2                                                         C22:1              0.4                                                         UNKNOWNS           2.4                                                         TOTAL              100                                                         ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAL>  The safflower oil was a commerically-available edible oil containing      triglycerides, diglycerides and monoglycerides which had been refined,      bleached and deodorized. Commerically available samples of distearin and      monostearin were used as the diglyceride and monoglyceride, respectively.      The desorbent was 2-heptanone. The desorbent material was run continuously      at a nominal liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 1 (about 1.1-1.5 ml      per minute flow rate). At convenient time intervals, the desorbent was      stopped and the feed component-desorbent mixtures were each run for a      1.3-1.8 minute interval at a rate of 1.3-1.5 ml/min. The desorbent stream      was resumed at I LHSV after each pulse and continued to pass into the      adsorbent column until each of the feed components had been eluted from      the column as determined by observing the chromatograph generated by the      effluent stream leaving the adsorbent column. The individual      chromatographic tracings obtained were overlaid and are shown in FIG. 1.      The triglyceride product eluted substantially at the void volume (as      determined by n-hexane).

All were      satisfactory, but the use of acetone is especially advantageous in that      all monoglycerides are strongly adsorbed and desorbed at the same time as      the free fatty acids in the extract. </PAR><TBL>                                    TABLE 6                                      __________________________________________________________________________     Desorbent                                                                               Acetone MEK     MtBE    Diglyme                                       Components                                                                              GRV NRV GRV NRV GRV NRV GRV NRV                                       __________________________________________________________________________     Triglycerides                                                                           40.4                                                                               0.0 40.4                                                                               0.0 40.2                                                                               0.2 38.4                                                                               0.0                                       Free Fatty Acids                                                                        54.0                                                                               13.6                                                                               56.2                                                                               15.8                                                                               55.0                                                                               14.8                                                                               45.4                                                                               7.0                                       Distearin                                                                               41.6                                                                               1.2 43.6                                                                               3.2 46.4                                                                               6.2 41.0                                                                               2.6                                       Monostearin                                                                             53.8                                                                               13.4                                                                               73.8                                                                               33.4                                                                               128.2                                                                              88.0                                                                               49.6                                                                               11.2                                      __________________________________________________________________________ </TBL><PAC>  EXAMPLE V </PAC><PAR>  This example illustrates my process, when operated in a preferred      embodiment, utilizing a continuous simulated moving bed countercurrent      type of operation comprising a pilot plant scale testing apparatus similar      to the manifold arrangement of FIG. 7 described in detail in deRosset et      al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,706,812, incorporated herein by reference. Briefly,      the apparatus consists essentially of 24 serially connected adsorbent      chambers having about 50 cc volume each. Total chamber volume of the      apparatus is approximately 1200 cc. The individual adsorbent chambers are      serially connected to each other with relatively small diameter connecting      piping and to a rotary type valve supplying each of the inlet and outlet      streams. By manipulating the rotary valves and maintaining given pressure      differentials and flow rates through the various lines passing into and      out of the series of chambers, a simulated countercurrent flow is      produced. The adsorbent, silica gel (Davisil 636), remains stationary      while fluid flows throughout the serially connected chambers in a manner      which when viewed from any position within the adsorbent chambers is      steady countercurrent flow. The rotary valves are controlled to effect a      periodic shifting to allow a new operation to take place in the adsorbent      beds located between the active inlet and outlet ports of the rotary      valves. Each of the rotary valves is attached to one of the input lines or      output lines and directs the respective fluids to and from the individual      chambers in sequence. A feed input line contains one rotary valve through      which the feed mixture passes, whereby feed can be directed to each of the      chambers in a predetermined sequence. A second valve is contained in an      extract stream outlet line, through which passes the desorbent material in      admixture with free fatty acids, most of the monoglycerides and      diglycerides from each of the chambers in sequence. A third and fourth      rotary valves are contained, respectively, in a desorbent material inlet      line through which passes desorbent materials to individual chambers and a      raffinate stream outlet line through which passes triglycerides and some      of the diglycerides in admixture with desorbent material from individual      chambers. </PAR><PAR>  The feed mixture to the apparatus was a mixture of monoglycerides,      diglycerides, triglycerides and free fatty acids resulting from a lipase      catalyzed interesterification reaction, having the composition given in      Table 7. The desorbent was 2-heptanone. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 7                                                          ______________________________________                                         Component          Weight Percent                                              ______________________________________                                         Triglycerides      37.4                                                        Free Fatty Acids (FFA's)                                                                          57.0                                                        Diglycerides       5.4                                                         Monoglycerides     0.2                                                         ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  The operating parameters of the carousel unit during two periods of the run      were as follows: </PAR><PA1>  1. A/Fandequals;3.2 and 3.4, where A is the selective pore volume of the adsorbent      in ml/hr and F is the feed rate to the separation stage in ml/hr. The      selective pore volume is that volume of the adsorbent which has the      ability to selectively adsorb one component of a mixture over another. </PA1><PA1>  2. Process temperatureandequals;50.degree. C. </PA1><PA1>  3. Valve cycle timeandequals;90 min. </PA1><PAR>  Conditions, however, can vary in practice and to achieve certain      performance results. For example, at the process temperature and valve      cycle time listed above, zone rates were varied to achieve a range of      purity and recovery results. </PAR><PAR>  A number of experiments, each of 6 hours duration, were conducted on the      carousel unit. In these experiments, it was observed that the free fatty      acids were adsorbed along with the monoglycerides and some of the      diglycerides and so were separated with the extract, while the      triglycerides and some of the diglycerides were relatively unadsorbed and      so were separated with the raffinate. However, the conditions can be set      in a well-known manner, e.g., by varying the zone rates to desorb more or      less diglycerides and, if desired, remove substantially all the      diglycerides in the extract or the raffinate. For example, increasing the      zone II rate will increase the concentration of diglycerides in the      triglyceride product removed as raffinate. Therefore, a predetermined      amount of diglycerides can be directed to the raffinate and extract      products. Further, an additional outlet stream may be employed (either a      second extract or second raffinate stream) to remove the remainder of the      diglycerides, or, if desired, up to substantially all of the diglycerides      in the feed. In many food applications, a certain amount of diglycerides      may be permitted, e.g., up to about 15%, but preferably about 2-4%, and      process conditions may be relaxed, making the separation less costly. </PAR><PAR>  The composition of the extract product streams and raffinate streams for      the two periods were as follows: </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 8                                                          ______________________________________                                         Period A/F             FFA's  MG's   DG's  TG's                                ______________________________________                                         1      3.2     Raff.   0.6    0.2    0.2   99.0                                               Extract 86.5   0.7    11.3  1.5                                 2      3.4     Raff.   1.5    0.2    2.8   95.6                                               Extract 90.6   0.6    8.8   0                                   ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  In these experiments the extract and raffinate streams were analyzed for      their monoglyceride, fatty acid and di- and triglyceride content. The      results of these experiments were plotted and are shown in FIG. 2 as a      curve of triglyceride raffinate purity versus triglyceride recovery. The      separation performance ranged from triglyceride purity of 96-99% at 99% andplus;      recovery. The triglyceride raffinate product can be further freed of fatty      acids, where the content is low, e.g., below about 1%, by cooling the      raffinate product to 0.degree. C., whereupon the triglycerides are      precipitated and can be filtered from the remaining mixture of desorbent      and fatty acid. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, it is clear from the above that the use of a silica gel adsorbent      enables the separation of triglycerides from a glyceride mixture      containing mono-, di- and triglycerides and free fatty acids. Since the      effects of different operating conditions on the product purity and yield      have not been completely investigated, the results of the above tests are      not intended to represent the optimums that might be achieved. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
