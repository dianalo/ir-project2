The plan, similar to ones adopted by a number of major companies recently, would permit Xerox shareholders to purchase shares in an acquiring company at half price, under certain conditions. Such plans are designed to make unfriendly takeovers prohibitively expensive.    Rights under the plan will be issued April 16 to stock of record on that date. Xerox, an office-equipment and financial-services concern, said it wasn't aware of any efforts to make a bid for the company.    Xerox said also it would ask holders at the May 21 annual meeting to increase the number of authorized common shares to 350 million from 150 million. The company said it hasn't any plans to issue additional shares, but could use them for mergers and acquisitions, stock splits, employee benefit plans and other business purposes. As of March 31, the company had 98.4 million common shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
