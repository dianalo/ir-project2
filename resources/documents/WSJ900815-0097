Such muddled thinking is routine, say security experts,when it comes to protecting the data, much of it explosive,in many companies' computers.</LP><TEXT>   Spurred by media hype, companies have rushed to protecttheir data against computer viruses, rogue software that is ahigh-tech form of vandalism. By next year, some 53% ofcorporate computer users will have anti-virus measures inplace, according to the National Center for Computer CrimeData.   That's a big jump from 22% of users in 1988, and a hugeleap from 1% in 1985, making virus-protection thefastest-growing category of security measure tracked by theNCCCD. Reliable estimates are hard to come by, but leaders inthe fledgling anti-virus industry estimate that the field hasanywhere from $25 million to over $100 million in annualsales.   Still, data-security experts say viruses, which jam upcomputers and sometimes destroy files, are at worst a minorannoyance for most companies. Indeed, they say, fear ofviruses may be diverting attention from more mundane, but farmore effective, security measures that many companies havebeen slow to adopt.   This concern was thrown into sharp relief Monday, when afire at an electrical substation blacked out part of lowerManhattan and threw the financial district into moreconfusion than any virus has caused. While no major financialinstitution admitted to losing data, several key stock andcommodity exchanges were forced to halt trading as theircomputers shut down.   Many financial firms, already hyperaware of data security,said the experience should reinforce an emerging sense thatviruses, while important, are the least of their worries.   &quot;If you're alert, you should be able to prevent andcontrol viruses,&quot; says Walter Brenner, a Credit Lyonnais S.A.senior vice president who spent yesterday at a computerdisaster-recovery facility operated by Comdisco Inc. in NorthBergen, N.J. &quot;Something like {the blackout}, you have nocontrol over. You simply have to be prepared.&quot; CreditLyonnais lost no work in the power outage, he adds, butcompleted many transactions later than usual.   Rick Morrison of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which ranits computers on emergency power for most of Monday, agrees:&quot;We'll continue to do a lot to prevent viruses, but thisstuff has to be our meat and potatoes.&quot;   Other meat-and-potatoes measures, say security experts,include denying people access to information they don't needto do their jobs; guarding against sloppy input ofinformation; making extra copies of all vital information;guarding against actual theft of computers; preparing fornatural disasters; and making sure company policy isunderstood.   But the fear of viruses persists. &quot;Every time I startadvising a company, I have to spend the first few daysdisabusing them of the notion that viruses are their biggestproblem,&quot; gripes Robert Courtney, a computer consultant basedin Port Ewen, N.Y.   Mr. Courtney and others say outsiders account for onlyabout 3% of data-security losses, measured in dollars. Andviruswriters are only a portion of those outsiders. Thatpales beside the whopping 50%-65% most experts say is lostthrough avoidable mistakes, such as clerks keying in thewrong account number without being prompted to double-checkentries.   Along with power failures, another underestimated securityproblem, according to Mr. Courtney, is water. &quot;Leaking roofsdo three times as much damage to computer data as all thevirus writers in the world put together,&quot; he says. &quot;Butpeople don't want to hear that. They like their problems tobe intellectually titillating; they don't want to deal withdumb clerks or broken pipes.&quot;   Even in the category of outright computer crime, estimatedto cost U.S. companies about $1 billion a year, viruses comelow on the totem pole. &quot;In relation to all other problems,I'd have to say it's at the bottom,&quot; says Ronald Keelan, aformer International Business Machines Corp. security expertwho works as a consultant in Larchmont, N.Y.   Mr. Keelan says most computer crime can be stymied byscreening personnel and restricting access to computers,since disgruntled and dishonest employees are the mainculprits. Guarding against viruses is easy and a good idea,he says, but it shouldn't detract from more basic issues:&quot;That's like building a house, installing a fancy burglaralarm, and then leaving a big hole in the wall.&quot;   (One exception to this rule, he notes, is universitycampuses, where computer viruses have become the most seriousdata-security problem.)   Still, companies are increasingly enamored of the bellsand whistles of anti-virus software even though computerviruses are spread by very specific types of action and areeasy to prevent -- often using free software. In addition,most computer viruses are easy to recover from, especially ifa company routinely makes backup copies of its software anddata.   But the media's focus on viruses has mesmerized topmanagement, says Ivan Brass, director of information servicesfor Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;With viruses, thebiggest fear is that you'll end up on the front page,&quot; hesays. Concern about that kind of bad publicity &quot;changesspending patterns,&quot; he adds.   But like other security professionals, Mr. Brass is loathto discourage any trend that makes people more aware of datasecurity -- especially when the threat from viruses, thoughrelatively small, is real. &quot;Without the publicity,&quot; he says,&quot;we wouldn't be as far along in protecting computers as weare today.&quot;   Fear of viruses can also be used to justify other, morestrategic expenditures. &quot;I know lots of security people whouse instances {of virus attacks} in the press to leveragetheir buying,&quot; says Kim Bell of Computer Associates, whichsells security software.   Observes Buck BloomBecker, director of NCCCD and acrusader for computer security: &quot;If we want people to buy {aparticular security product}, all we have to do is say it'sthe best way to fight viruses.&quot;   Not everyone agrees that viruses have been blown out ofproportion. &quot;It causes more damage than any other securityproblem,&quot; asserts John McAfee of McAfee Associates, ananti-virus software and consulting company in Santa Clara,Calif. &quot;Anyone who says it's a lower priority just hasn'tbeen hit yet.&quot;   Mr. McAfee takes issue with the statistics cited by mostconsultants, saying the vast majority of damage from virusesgoes unreported. Though he won't name names, he says he knowsof several big corporations that have lost &quot;tens of millionsof dollars&quot; because of virus attacks, which he says areproliferating.   &quot;This is something no one talks about,&quot; he says. &quot;I'venever had a client who had any interest whatsoever inpublicity about his company's problems.&quot;   But most experts, while agreeing that many companiesprobably hush up virus attacks, contend that only a negligentcompany could lose a large amount of data to a virus. &quot;It'san inconvenience, not a large monetary or data loss,&quot; saysBill Vance, director of secure systems for IBM.   Clifford Stoll, who recounted his battles with a computer&quot;hacker&quot; in a recent bestselling book, agrees: &quot;The mainthing spread by viruses is paranoia.&quot;   ---                      Data Damage                                                                                                          Percentage of losses related to data security, in dollars,caused by:                                                                                                          Errors and omissions                    65%   Dishonest or disgruntled employees      19%   Loss of infrastructure*                  8%   Outsiders, including virus writers       3%                                                                                                          *Such as power outages and natural disasters   Source: Robert Courtney Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
