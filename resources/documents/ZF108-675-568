Colin.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>HyperLogic develops a software package which utilizes fuzzy settheory as the basis for creating decision systems fornatural-language users.andP;  The package, called CubiCalc, operates onany microcomputer with DOS and Microsoft Windows and has aMacintosh-like interface.andP;  It allows a set of rules about anapplication to be written and then evaluated against real-timeinputs.andP;  Fuzzy instructions, which characterize the package,contain no absolute values that can be represented by specificnumbers.andP;  The system consists of a set of fuzzy rules about anapplication written in a language customized for the specificapplication.andP;  The inputs are gotten from disk files of historicaldata, and placed within fuzzy sets of parameters or ranges whichallow for overlapping.andP;  Ranges are drawn with the mouse on aninput-output graph for each variable.andP;  CubiCalc outputs can thenbe fed into a variety of graphing routines.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   HyperLogic Corp.
