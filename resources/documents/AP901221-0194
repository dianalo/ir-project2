Welfare recipients in Denmark and the Netherlands are frequentlyentitled to subsidies that help pay their rent, child care, basicfurnishings and clothes.   Coming on top of cash benefits, those add-ons often mean awelfare recipient has a bigger income than a skilled industrialworker.   Authorities in Amsterdam recently offered the use of leased carsto people willing to take jobs in the flower industry in theAalsmeer suburb. The plan failed because not enough people wereinterested.   Another plan to give jobs to the unemployed in the northernvillage of Stadskanaal in the vital flower bulb harvest 60-milesaway also failed. The unemployed did not want to work that far awayfrom home, even though they were going to be given temporaryhousing in the region.   Desperate bulb growers eventually returned to their illegal buttolerated practice of hiring seasonal workers from Poland.   A Dutch Social Affairs Ministry study showed recently that acouple getting 1,611 guilders ($964) a month in benefits would lose5 percent if either partner were hired in a minimum-wage job thatpays the same, mostly because of expenses like commuting thatemployers won't refund.   The prospect of losing welfare subsidies on rent and otherbasics often means that looking for a better-paid job is barelyworthwhile.   Both the Netherlands and Denmark provide all parents withchild-rearing payments, which take the place of the dependentdeduction in the U.S. tax system.   Questions have been raised whether rich Danish families shouldbe getting benefits of 5,600 kroner ($1,000) per year for each oftheir children. Dutch payments are considerably lower.   Spurred by high taxation, many welfare recipients, even those ondisability pensions, resurface in the so-called ``Black Economy,''doing off-the-books blue-collar jobs in exchange for cash.   The Dutch Welfare Ministry employs dozens of ``socialdetectives'' who have full police powers to investigate such abuseswhich defraud the state of tens of billions of dollars in welfarebenefits and tax revenue each year.   Although the benefits can be many, applying for them can involvea frustrating months-long trip through the bureaucracy to find outwhich of the many different welfare programs applies.   Rigid qualification rules often hinder a recipient's own effortsto seek a job. Dutch unemployment benefit recipients can be barredfrom attending job training programs because that's consideredabusing dole money as an educational grant.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday Jan 6</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
