The primary reason is corporate profits have been lowerthan expected, and individual incomes have been higher thanexpected, a Treasury official said.</LP><TEXT>   Harvey Rosen, the assistant Treasury secretary for taxanalysis, said that wages, salaries and interest rates havebeen higher than expected in the three years since the taxoverhaul began taking effect. That has raised the income, andthe taxes, of individuals. It has also raised the costs ofcorporations, squeezed their profits, and thus lowered theirtaxes from what was forecast when the bill was passed.   The 1986 law made sweeping changes in the corporate incometax system. While it lowered the top tax rate forcorporations, it also repealed the investment tax credit,limited depreciation deductions, restricted the use of netoperating losses and strengthened the alternative minimum taxso corporations couldn't legally avoid paying tax.   Together, these changes were expected to increasecorporate income tax receipts by $120 billion from 1987through 1991. But so far, the receipts have fallen short ofgovernment projections by between $20 billion and $25 billionannually in 1987, 1988 and 1989, the Treasury estimated.   Nevertheless, corporate tax receipts have grown each yearsince the 1986 tax act. For 1989, they are believed to havereached a record $104 billion, Mr. Rosen said.   Moreover, Mr. Rosen said the tax law was succeeding in itsaim of shifting some of the tax burden from individuals tobusinesses. &quot;The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reversed a long-termdecline in the relative importance of corporate taxes inproducing revenues for the U.S. government,&quot; he said. &quot;Theshare of total taxes paid by corporations has been steadilyrising since 1986.&quot;   Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional BudgetOffice, agreed with most of Mr. Rosen's assessments.Testifying before the committee, he estimated that about 58%of the shortfall in corporate tax receipts in the past threeyears probably stemmed from lower-than-expected profits.   Mr. Rosen and Mr. Reischauer also said an increasingnumber of companies have chosen to organize as S corporationsor partnerships -- forms of business that are taxed at theshareholder or partner level rather than the corporate level.   Mr. Reischauer also said &quot;an important cause oflower-than-projected profits during the 1987-1989 period wasfurther increased reliance by corporations on debt financinginstead of equity financing.&quot;   The 1980s saw a wave of leveraged buy-outs of companies,deals that were largely financed by borrowing. Interestpayments on the debt load are tax-deductible and thereforereduce the taxable income reported to the government.   Consequently, the committee chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsenof Texas, said the shortfall in corporate tax receipts wasn't&quot;just a question of interest rates having exceededexpectations, but a question of the massive movement to debtfrom equity in this country.&quot;   But Mr. Rosen said that data so far suggest that leveragedbuy-outs had little impact on total corporate interestpayments.   &quot;The effect of LBOs on corporate profits is unclear,&quot; hesaid, explaining that if the acquired firms are reorganizedand managed more efficiently, profits could increase, leadingto a higher tax bill.</TEXT></DOC>
