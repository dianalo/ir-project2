Single-layerand multilayer models are computed with varying layer thicknesses havingelastic constants appropriate for water- and hydrocarbon-saturated sands,shales, and carbonates. Pre-stack and post-stack attributes of the synthetictraces are computed to investigate reflection and transmission propagationeffects. Tuning and multiple interference must be considered in the interpretationof amplitude versus offset (AVO). Converted shear events must be identified,as they always have increasing AVO. Even though the top and bottom ofa thin-layer reflector cannot be resolved, the compressional primaryelastic reflection coefficients are still observable if corrections aremade for tuning and multiple interference. Strong angle or offset dependentattenuation occurs upon transmission of elastic waves through low Poisson'sratio, gas-saturated sands. Amplitude and phase attributes of partialstack traces are very useful for observing very subtle changes in waveshape caused by these propagation effects.</TEXT></DOC>
