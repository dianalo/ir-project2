With first-quarter earnings reports due over the nextseveral weeks, more bad news is expected. But themoney-center banks are considered better able to weather anyshocks than ever before, because they have built up a largerbase of stable consumer deposits -- nearly all insured by thefederal government.</LP><TEXT>   The extra buffer came in handy last fall when risingproblem loans and falling credit ratings at some big U.S.banks sent shudders through the world financial markets,raising fears of a quiet run by foreign and institutionaldepositors similar to the one that helped sink ContinentalIllinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. in 1984.   Some big U.S. banks had to pay a bit more for depositsfrom abroad and European and Japanese banks grew choosier inplacing deposits with U.S. banks, but a funding crisis didn'thappen.   While major U.S. banks were eager to lessen their relianceon so-called hot money sources, the shift in their fundingmix is as much a byproduct of their push into all types ofconsumer banking services, which in recent years have becomemore profitable than lending to major corporations andgovernments.   &quot;We have deliberately increased our reliance on consumerdeposits because the corporation wants to become more adomestic institution and a more regional bankinginstitution,&quot; says Joseph G. Sponholz, chief financialofficer of Chemical Banking Corp.   Chemical, which had taken 55% of its deposits from foreignand institutional sources in 1983, today draws only 12% fromthose sources, Mr. Sponholz says. &quot;We think that we are aboutas liquid as we would wish to be,&quot; he adds.   Stable consumer deposits, known in the industry as &quot;coredeposits,&quot; are widely credited with giving BankAmerica Corp.the time to work through its woes in the 1985-87 period, whenit posted $1.8 billion in losses. &quot;Those core deposits becomede facto capital that gives banks time to work through theirtroubles,&quot; says James McDermott, president of bank-stockspecialist Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.   &quot;Just at the time {major banks} needed to have minimalexposure to the wholesale markets, they have that verysituation,&quot; says Ronald Reading, a partner in First ManhattanConsulting Group, a New York bank consulting firm. Major U.S.banks all drastically altered their liquidity positions inthe past six years, he says.   The strategies for building up a consumer deposit basediffer among the biggest banks. Citicorp, parent of thenation's largest bank, has made a big push to develop strongconsumer banking operations outside the U.S. At year end,Citicorp had $45.5 billion of overseas consumer deposits, or46% of all consumer deposits totaling $99.5 billion. In 1990,Citicorp's foreign consumer deposits rose 25%, while U.S.consumer deposits grew only 2.7%.   BankAmerica, the second-largest U.S. banking company, haslong had a strong consumer banking franchise in California.But it has expanded its consumer deposit base rapidly in thelast year, largely by acquiring failed thrifts.   BankAmerica has acquired $14.67 billion of failed thrifts'deposits in eight Western states. The San Francisco companyalso is bidding for $20 billion of deposits of the failedBank of New England Corp.   On a somewhat smaller scale, Chase Manhattan Corp. alsohas used wreckage from the thrift industry to build itsconsumer deposit base. Chase acquired $2.01 billion ofdeposits from the failed Seamen's Bank for Savings last year,and added $630 million by buying branches from Citicorp andDollar Dry Dock Savings Bank.   Donald L. Boudreau, a Chase group executive for regionalbanking, says the growth is mainly intended to expand Chase'sshare of the consumer banking market in New York, but adds,&quot;an ancillary benefit was that it enhanced the fundingstability of the company.&quot;   Banks also have cut funding needs by packaging loans intosecurities and selling them to institutional investors. Knownas securitization, the technique lets the banks keep somerevenue from the loans by collecting payments from borrowersand passing them on to the investors.   Citicorp, for example, securitized $25 billion of assetslast year, mostly home mortgages and credit-card loans. Thatrepresented a 58% increase from the $15.8 billion in assetsthat Citicorp securitized in 1989. Chemical securitized about$3.3 billion of consumer loans and mortgages last year, andChase securitized about $2.1 billion of assets and agreed tosell $1.2 billion of guaranteed student loans.   Several of the largest U.S. banks, including Citicorp,Chase and Chemical, also have slashed sales of their owncommercial paper as a funding source during the past year.Citicorp, for example, cut its paper outstanding to $3.24billion from $7.12 billion last year.   Not all big banks have charged into consumer banking. J.P.Morgan andamp; Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp. have eschewedsmaller accounts, but have built balance sheets that arelight on loans and heavy on government bonds and short-termsecurities that can be sold quickly to raise cash if needed.   The need for many of the largest U.S. banks to gainstability in funding became apparent last fall, when British,European and Japanese banks began lowering limits on how muchthey would deposit even overnight with some U.S. banks,because of fears that banks might collapse under the weightof problem loans.   &quot;There has been a flight to quality,&quot; says Rodolfo Bogni,chief executive of Swiss Bank Corp.'s London unit, which,like every other European bank, is constantly reviewing itsexposure to the international markets.   European banks imposed tighter limits on purchases of U.S.bank debt, as well as stricter limits on U.S. accounts in theLondon foreign exchange markets. The U.K. clearing banks --Barclays Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank PLC, MidlandBank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC -- appear to have beenparticularly aggressive, in some cases reducing exposure tosome weaker U.S. money-center banks by 50%. On average, somebig U.K. banks have trimmed their exposures to the U.S. bankfunding market by 25%, senior British bankers say. However,top-rated institutions such as J.P. Morgan still enjoy accessto &quot;100% of their previous funding,&quot; says a U.K. banker.   Some U.S. banks found themselves on a shorter leash evenif their credit lines hadn't been cut entirely. Sometop-quality European banks shifted their exposure toshorter-term U.S. paper, with maturities of a month or less,rather than maturities of six months or more.   The jitters also affected the growing business ofinterest-rate swaps and other products known as derivatives.This market, once the almost-exclusive preserve of U.S.banks, is suddenly more competitive. U.K. and European banksare increasing their share of the business as top Europeancompanies shy away from long-term commitments with U.S.banks.   &quot;The notion of a banking crisis in the U.S. has causedEuropean banks to cut back a little bit in terms of how longthey will go with various kinds of trading products orfunding,&quot; says Hollis W. Rademacher, chief financial officerof Continental Bank Corp., Chicago. &quot;Rather than do a 10-yearswap, they may only do five {years},&quot; Mr. Rademacher says,adding they also may cut the total amount of business they'lldo with an individual bank.   In Tokyo, U.S.-Japanese bank ties are under some strain,as bankers on both sides say they increasingly question eachother's credit quality. &quot;Everyone is looking at everyone elseacross the water with slightly wary eyes,&quot; says C. TimothyWood, the head of Continental Bank's Tokyo office.   Evidence of the new caution abounds. Japanese banks haveslashed credit lines to some U.S. banks; U.S. banks arecharging some Japanese banks a premium for loans. Some U.S.banks claim they can't get a Japanese bank to cough up moneyfor any bank loan whose term is longer than a month. And someJapanese banks counter that U.S. bankers ignored a flood ofpotentially lucrative fund raisings the Japanese arrangedearlier this year.   Japanese bankers say the main factors behind theirreluctance to lend to U.S. banks are the more restrictivecapital rules that are being imposed on banks world-wide andthe deteriorating credit quality of many big U.S. banks.   &quot;Japanese banks argue that there are only one or twoAmerican banks they are willing to lend funds to&quot; on along-term basis, says Richard C. Koo, a senior economist atNomura Research Institute Ltd. &quot;They're very scared.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
