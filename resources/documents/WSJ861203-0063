The retirement systems argue that the rule will be costly and confusing and will make their pension funding look better than it really is.    But the GASB maintains that the recently issued rule will make it easier for analysts to compare the pension data of diverse government entities at a &quot;minimal cost.&quot; The GASB is the chief maker of accounting rules for governmental bodies.    New York state is &quot;concerned about the rule because it could lead legislators, employee groups and unions to seek added employment benefits that we simply can't afford,&quot; said John Mauhs, a deputy state controller heading the state's retirement division.    The actuarial method mandated by the new GASB rule generally produces a smaller unfunded pension liability than the actuarial methods currently used by public pension funds. An unfunded liability is the amount by which a pension plan's obligations exceed its assets.    The new rule requires state and local government employers and public-employee retirement systems to disclose their unfunded pension liability a certain way -- using one specific actuarial technique picked by the GASB. But, in addition, it allows the retirement systems to continue to use -- and to also report -- a different method to determine how much money they actually contribute to the pension plan.    Thus the new rule, in many cases, will require a government body to report its unfunded pension liability in two ways -- reflecting how the plan is actually funded, and how the obligation would be measured under the new GASB rule's method.    &quot;There's no question this rule is controversial,&quot; says Martin Ives, the vice chairman and director of research of the GASB in Stamford, Conn. &quot;But public pension funds currently use up to a dozen different funding and reporting methods. And financial analysts find it impossible to compare them when considering which government securities to buy.&quot;    Significantly, even James F. Antonio, the current chairman of the GASB and former state auditor of Missouri, opposed the new rule. While he supports a single way of disclosing the pension obligation of government entities, he believes the disclosure should better reflect the actuarial measurement systems used by most of these entities.    Vernon Strickland, president of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, says that most states oppose the GASB rule because it &quot;imposes another layer for their disclosure.&quot;    David Senn, executive secretary of the Montana Teacher's Retirement System in Helena, estimates that the added disclosure could cost the state &quot;an extra $6,000 every other year, when we issue our reports.&quot; He added: &quot;It will make us appear overfunded, which we aren't, and it just isn't worth it.&quot;    But the GASB's Mr. Ives said that despite current opposition, the rule will greatly improve the ability of financial analysts &quot;to compare the relative pension funding status among all governmental employers and pension plans.&quot;    William W. Fish, senior vice president and manager of the public finance research group of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., a securities firm, agrees. &quot;With all the current pension funding methods of government entities, it is like comparing apples and oranges right now,&quot; he said. &quot;And comparing pension funding of government entities on a level playing field could be a factor in raising or lowering their debt ratings.&quot;    The new GASB rule on pension disclosure is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 1986, with earlier use encouraged, Mr. Ives said. </TEXT></DOC>
