The Soviet researchers were in Boston Sunday to describe currentSoviet research at the annual meeting of the American Associationfor the Advancement of Science.   Seven administrators from the most prestigious Soviet scienceinstitutes answered a wide range of questions from reporters in arare meeting with the press Saturday.   The researchers seemed relaxed, and they answered questionswithout hesitation, including difficult questions on Sovietdevelopment of a Star Wars defense system.   ``The Soviet Union does not intend to develop a system like theUnited States is working on,'' said Andrey A. Kokoshin, deputydirector of the Institute for USA and Canada Studies.   A few moments later, when another Soviet researcher demonstrateda flashlight-sized laser pointer of the type used by speakers tocall attention to details on projected slides, Kokoshin elicitedlaughter when he said, ``This is our SDI (Strategic DefenseInitiative).''   Asked about development of chemical lasers, which might be usedin a missile defense system, Kokoshin said, ``They are not verypromising, I would say.''   On Jan. 12, Frank Press of the U.S. National Academy of Sciencesand Guriy Marchuk, president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,signed a five-year agreement providing for scientific exchanges andcooperation.   Under the terms of that agreement, joint scientific workshopswill be held during the next two years on such topics as vaccinedevelopment, earthquake prediction, planetary science,biotechnology and astrophysics.   Konstantin V. Frolov, vice-president of the Academy of Sciencesof the U.S.S.R., said that mathematics, theoretical physics andlaser and semiconductor technology are some of the traditionalstrongholds of Soviet science.   ``The Soviet Union has developed a number of sophisticatedscientific instruments,'' he said, speaking through a translator.   Computer software useful in oceanography has also been developedin the Soviet Union, he said.   In the upcoming scientific exchanges, he said, ``these are areaswhere the Soviet side could bring something to the table.''   He proposed that joint ventures be established to developcomputer manufacture. ``There was quite a gap in the introductionof computers in the Soviet Union, particularly personalcomputers,'' he said.   Yuriy A. Ossipyan, director of the Institute for Solid StatePhysics, said that Soviet scientists had developed a newdescription of the interaction of materials in certainhigh-temperature superconductors. He said that research onsuperconductivity is being actively pursued at his institute andelsewhere in the Soviet Union.   In a presentation Sunday, Mikhail V. Ivanov, director of theInstitute for Microbiology, said that the Soviet union has builtindustrial plants for the production of animal feed through yeastfermentation.   Bacteria are being used to leach metals from poor quality ores,to decrease potentially dangerous levels of methane gas in coalmines and to enhance oil recovery, Ivanov said.   Albert Galeev of the Institute for Space Research described theplanned launch in July of a spacecraft to study the Martian moonPhobos, which may be an asteroid that got trapped in orbit aroundMars.</TEXT></DOC>
