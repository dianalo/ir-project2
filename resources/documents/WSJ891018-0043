The two companies also agreed to settle any future property rights issues over the next 10 years through binding arbitration, both companies said.    The products are so-called analog integrated circuits that have applications in the consumer electronics, automobile and electronic instrumentation markets. Linear Technology, Milpitas, Calif., called the settlement &quot;positive,&quot; since products covered by the disputed patents account for about 20% of its annual sales.    The electronics concern said it already has paid $2 million of the settlement to National Semiconductor, Santa Clara, Calif., and will pay the remaining $1 million in equal installments over the next eight quarters. The payments aren't expected to have an impact on coming operating results, Linear added. </TEXT></DOC>
