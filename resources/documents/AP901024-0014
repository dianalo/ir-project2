Pete Williams, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary DickCheney, said Tuesday that Iraq is making ``some adjustments'' toits military operations in and around Kuwait as a result of theembargo, which has been in effect since Aug. 6, four days afterIraq invaded its neighbor.   Williams said U.S. authorities believe the Iraqi military issuffering shortages of tires and other materials. He cited Iraq'srecently imposed rationing of civilian supplies of gasoline as anindication that the whole nation, including its military, isthreatened by the sanctions.   ``As time goes by, the sanctions continue to have effect. Itbecomes harder and harder to support that (military) force as theembargo restricts the shipment of spare parts and supplies,''Williams told a news briefing.   Iraq has about 430,000 forces in Kuwait and southern Iraq,bolstered by 3,500 tanks, the spokesman said. Those Pentagonestimates have not changed for several weeks, but Williams said hecould not comment on whether Iraq's buildup appeared to be over.   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,told reporters in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that the Iraqi armyremains ``very solidly in Kuwait.'' He said he saw no evidence thatIraq was moving forces away from the Saudi border.   Williams said U.S. military authorities believe the Iraqi armyremains capable of quickly launching an offensive strike into SaudiArabia, even though it has spent more than two months digging inand fortifying defensive positions.   He indicated that Iraqi armored units are deployed behind ashield of anti-tank ditches, earthen mounds and minefields designedto stop an attack from Saudi soil.   Williams also disclosed that the Pentagon was consideringstarting a new wave of troop deployments to the Persian Gulf area.Such a move would take Operation Desert Shield beyond the 240,000personnel currently planned.   Williams said more than 210,000 U.S. troops now are in andaround Saudi Arabia. That is 10,000 more than the last officialcount issued by Cheney on Oct. 13.   Williams said Powell was consulting in Saudi Arabia with U.S.and Saudi officials on the possible need to expand Desert Shielddeployments, which President Bush ordered on Aug. 7.   Powell will report his recommendations to Cheney after returningto Washington on Thursday, Williams said.   ``Then those decisions will be made on whether additional forcesneed to be sent or not,'' Williams said. ``So I don't want to ...signal that the deployment is nearly complete - that's a decisionthat will be made in part this week by Gen. Powell's visit.''   Powell was attending a North Atlantic Treaty Organizationmeeting in Brussels today.   Williams said it had been planned all along that U.S. trooprequirements in the gulf would be reassessed once the initial roundof deployments was nearing completion.   U.S. ground forces in Saudi Arabia now include four Armydivisions, three Marine Corps expeditionary brigades, an airdefense artillery brigade, a mechanized infantry brigade and anarmored cavalry regiment. Also in the gulf area are more than 500aircraft and 55 ships, including aircraft carriers and abattleship.   An Army source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it waspossible that Powell would recommend reducing the American force inthe region, depending on military estimates of Iraq's troopstrength and other factors.</TEXT></DOC>
