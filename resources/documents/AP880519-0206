KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Conservative Republicans, spurning appealsfrom the Senate's GOP and Democratic leaders, urged colleagues onThursday to ignore the fast approaching U.S.-Soviet summit anddebate the medium-range arms reduction treaty for weeks.   But Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said: ``It's ourpresident who will be in Moscow next week and he'd like to havethis treaty. I say that as Republican leader on behalf of aRepublican president.   ``We have a special responsibility to President Ronald Reagan,''Dole said.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty calls for theelimination of all ground-launched missiles with a range of 300 to3,400 miles.   Shortly before Dole appealed to senators to bring any amendmentsthey may have to the Senate floor for action, Sen. Malcolm Wallop,R-Wyo., told his colleagues: ``We should not be playing beat theclock in our debate over the treaty.''   ``We cannot feel rushed by the artificial deadline of nextweek's summit,'' Wallop said. ``It should be beside the point tomeet a deadline.''   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said: ``Let us examine this treatycarefully and let the public relations deadline in Moscow bedamned.''   President Reagan's summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev is set to open May 29.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., noting that noamendments had been offered to the text of the treaty at thatpoint, asked unanimous consent to move to the resolution ofratification.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the leading opponent of the treaty,objected, saying amendments were being prepared by as many as foursenators.   About an hour later, Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, introduced anamendment that would prevent the treaty from going into effectuntil the president certifies the Soviets are in compliance withall other arms control treaties.   He asked for separate roll call votes on all five sections ofthe amendment, probably on Friday morning.   ``The Soviets cheated in the past and I think we can expect theyare going to cheat in the future and I think each senator ought togo on record whether he wants to condone cheating or not,'' Symmssaid.   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, noted that Secretary of State George P. Shultztestified that the treaty ``stands on its own merits and should notbe linked to other arms control treaties or other issues.''   ``It would be like cutting off our nose to spite our face,''Pell said.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said that linking the INF treaty toother issues ``is not in the best interest of our country.''   ``The INF treaty is not a favor to the Soviet Union,'' he said.``To make implementation depend on compliance with other treatiesis nonsensical.''   ``To deny ourselves a national security option does not makegood sense,'' Lugar said. ``This treaty stands on its own merits.''   Earlier, Wallop conceded the Senate eventually will ratify thetreaty, but he urged rejection of ``the drumbeat from the WhiteHouse and our leadership which demands our swift consent to the INFtreaty.''   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., raised the possibility afilibuster may have begun and said, ``I think if we were to votetonight it would be a surprise if there were 10 no's. I think thepresident of the United States deserves an opportunity for thisbody _ before he meets in Moscow _ to say yes or no.''   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., told him: ``I don't think now is thetime to start harping that we have to do this by a certaindeadline.''   Wallop added: ``For us to be hurried to suit the climate of asummit is just a wrong urging at this moment.''   Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., a treaty supporter, said: ``This treatyshould not be asked to bear the burden of amendments which arenothing more than thinly veiled attempts to delay itsratifications.''   Evans said hardcore arms control opponents have described thetreaty unfairly.   ``For some, the treaty apparently would result in apocalypticmilitary consequences,'' he said. ``That means we have had a steadystream of misleading, false testimony from the very militaryleaders we depend upon, and I don't think that's true.''   ``We do this treaty a disservice if we treat it as somethingmore or less than what it is, a single step back from the nuclearprecipice,'' Evans said. ``I think it is time to focus on what isin front of us instead of trying to bring in all of thenon-related, non-germane elements.   Although debate was sporadic, Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., theSenate's most senior member, endorsed the pact, calling it a``small first step in the long and difficult process'' of``reducing the likelihood of a nuclear holocaust.''   But Humphrey denounced it, saying, ``The INF treaty is a fraud,a dangerous fraud.''   The Senate voted 91-6 Wednesday to reject the first conservativeattack on the treaty. That was a point of order raised by Sen.Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who claimed Gorbachev wasn't authorized tosign the pact and it was therefore invalid.   Byrd told reporters on Thursday: ``The first vote would indicatethe Senate did not think it was a serious point. I did not think itwas.''</TEXT></DOC>
