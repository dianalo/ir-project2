After meeting with Democratic members of the committee, Rep.Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., decided to send a letter to FederalHome Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall calling for the speedyabolishment of the Federal Asset Disposition Association, said acommittee spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Two members of the committee, Rep. Thomas McMillen, D-Md., andRep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., are drafting legislation to dismantleFADA should Wall refuse to comply, the spokeswoman said.   Wall spokesman Karl Hoyle said the bank board, which regulates3,147 federally insured savings institutions, is unlikely to doaway with FADA.   ``We'd be the first to admit there were problems, but we havethose problems under control. We've got new management at FADA andwe believe it should have an opportunity to prove itself,'' he said.   In another development, the new chief executive of FADA, GeraldP. Carmen, said the agency made its first quarterly profit duringthe first three months of this year.   ``We will be posting a net profit of $538,000 for the firstquarter. The loss last year was approximately $7 million and theyear before that $3 million,'' he said. ``I don't want to make moreof it than it is, but I think it is kind of a turning point.''   The move to abolish FADA by House Democrats comes less than aweek after the release of a highly critical report by the BankingCommittee that charged FADA with being a ``bloated bureaucracy''that wasted millions of dollars.   The bank board created FADA in late 1985 by chartering it as aprivate savings institution. Despite that structure, it functionsas an arm of the government and all of its stock is owned by theinsurance fund that backs Sandamp;L deposits. The insurance fund is alsoFADA's only customer, paying it fees to manage loans and realestate from insolvent Sandamp;Ls.</TEXT></DOC>
