The FTC rule requiring the three-day cooling off period, which has been in effect since 1972, was aimed at countering high-pressure tactics by door-to-door sales people. The regulation applied to the sale of any item for $25 or more at a location away from the seller's normal place of business.    The commission said it revised the rule because the sale of arts and crafts at fairs don't appear to involve deceptive practices. The exemption for cars sold at public auctions and tent sales applies if the seller has a permanent place of business where a consumer can later complain. </TEXT></DOC>
