Successively, in the research on puttingFBRs to practical use (fiscal year 1984 - fiscal year 1986), as the basicsubjects of the research and development, the rationalization of aseismaticdesign method, the evaluation of the soundness of aseismatic structure,and the evaluation of the adaptability to new location in the futurechange of location conditions were taken up aiming at the constructionof a demonstration FBR, and the research was carried out for the purposeof increasing the structural reliability and economical efficiency. Theplan of building structures having low floor response, the examinationof reactor core supporting method, the examination on new structuralconcept, the evaluation of the buckling strength of thin-walled structures,the countermeasures to solshing in bulkhead structures, the evaluationof the applicability of vibration-exempting mechanism and others arereported.
