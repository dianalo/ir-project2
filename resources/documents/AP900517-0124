(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Purdue University professor saysit ain't easy being Kermit. But when you're the namesake of afamous frog, life isn't all bad.   Kermit Scott was the grade-school friend of Muppets creator JimHenson, who died Wednesday in New York of complications frombacterial pneumonia at age 53.   Scott had not heard from his friend since he was 14. That's whenthe Henson family left Leland, Miss., where the two grew uptogether. But Scott learned from a newspaper article years ago thatthe most famous of the Muppets was named for him.   ``I guess I made an impression on him,'' said Scott.   ``We had gone our ways, and I have very fond memories of ourtime toegether,'' Scott said Wednesday.   Named Theodore Kermit Scott Jr., he grew up being called Kermitbecause his father used the name Theodore.   ``It was a bit of a burden. No one else was ever named that,''he said, but added, ``Now it's a name everybody knows.''   Scott, a philosophy professor, says he often uses Muppets in hislectures.   The Kermit character, he said, has ``that kind of ability toremain open to all of the possibilities, while at the same timedealing with all the hassles.''   He said he always has been flattered Henson used his name forthe puppet known for singing, ``It ain't easy being green.''   ``I certainly felt there are a lot worse things my name could beassociated with. I'm very happy and proud of what heaccomplished,'' Scott said.</TEXT></DOC>
