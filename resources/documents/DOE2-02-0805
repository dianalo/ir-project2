It is therefore strongly suggested that experimentsaiming for the evaluation of the environmental fate of pollutants alsobe conducted in the presence of HS. In view of the continuing interestsin the environmental (photo)chemistry of pesticides and chlorinated aromaticpollutants, the authors are planning to further investigate the (photo)chemicalfate of such substrates in the presence of HS. They have therefore decidedto characterize several preparations of HS with the aid of nuclear magneticresonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques. The present paper covers theproton-NMR (/sup 1/H-NMR) spectroscopy of some FA and HA preparations.</TEXT></DOC>
