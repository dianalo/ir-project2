Kubota Corp. hopes so. Since 1986,the maker of tractors and iron pipes has plowed $158.1million into eight U.S. technology companies. The portfolioincludes minority stakes in such firms as Mips ComputerSystems Inc., one of the most successful new microprocessorcompanies, and Mycogen Corp., a developer of microbialpesticides.   Many old-line Japanese industrial companies in recentyears have bought into technologies that hold the promise ofgreater growth. Steelmakers, cement producers and textilemanufacturers are working on everything from computer chipsto optical fibers. But few have moved as broadly or brisklyas Kubota, a company that started out 100 years ago makingcast iron for machinery used in Japan's headlong rush towardindustrialization.</LP><TEXT>   With the company about to embark on its second century,&quot;our conventional business fields' future growth was not goodenough,&quot; explains Masahiro Yoshida, a managing director andchief strategist of the company's diversification into hightechnology.   So, instead of relying on rice harvesters and water pipesto keep sales growing, the company decided to learn to makethe computers that increasingly are used to design suchequipment.   With its mature businesses throwing off cash and itsextensive Japanese landholdings and securities providing amassive asset base, the company went shopping for promisingtalent in the U.S. &quot;In Japan, it's much more difficult tohire people who have such knowledge,&quot; Mr. Yoshida says.   Kubota's high-tech push hit a snag late last week. Twofounders of a company that eventually became StardentComputer Inc. alleged that Kubota -- which owns 22% of themini-supercomputer company -- conspired to fraudulentlyobtain the American company's technology and transfer it to awholly owned Kubota subsidiary. The executives, Allen Michelsand Matthew Sanders, sued for $25 million in damages.   Kubota executives deny the charges, and contend theirsupport has kept the struggling computer company on its feet.Mr. Yoshida claims the two Stardent executives &quot;are trying tocover their failure in business and blame it on somebodyelse.&quot;   Messrs. Michels and Sanders, aren't involved in dailyoperations of Stardent. In Newton, Mass., Stardent'spresident and chief executive, John William Poduska, said&quot;our relationship {with Kubota} has been and continues to beexcellent. . . . We have no knowledge of any facts that wouldgive rise to the basis of a legal claim.&quot; A spokeswoman saidthat directors will discuss the suit and the role of Messrs.Michels and Sanders with the company at a directors meetingtoday.   Stardent was created last fall when Ardent Computer Corp.,a Sunnyvale, Calif., firm founded by Messrs. Michels andSanders and funded largely by Kubota, was merged with StellarComputer Inc. a Newton,. Mass., company started by Mr.Poduska. Both companies had been started at the same time tomake graphics supercomputers, and the competition between thetwo was so ruthless that both lost money freely.   Whatever the truth, the dispute is an indication of thedifficulty in meshing an oldline industrial company --especially one from a country where corporate loyalty isconsidered a paramount virtue -- with the often brash,freewheeling cultures of U.S. high-tech ventures. &quot;We have toconcede,&quot; says Mr. Yoshida, that Kubota's initial assessmentof Stardent's &quot;business plan and the people responsible forcarrying out the business . . . was incorrect.&quot;   But Kubota isn't about to stop sowing capital overeas.And, despite worries in some quarters that U.S. companies areselling too much technology to potential foreign competitors,capital-starved American companies aren't about to stopaccepting help. Indeed, Kubota also made news earlier thisweek with an investment more in line with its traditionaloperations. The Japanese manufacturer joined Ford Motor Co.and Tenneco Inc. of the U.S. in agreeing to buy a 27% stakein Cummins Engine Co., a Columbus, Ind., maker of engines fortrucks and tractors. Kubota's stake would come to 5.4%,valued at $50 million.   The Cummins tie-up illustrates how companies increasinglyare turning to so-called global alliances to strengthen theirpresence in overseas markets. Kubota, which has had abusiness relationship with a Cummins subsidiary in the U.S.for several years, was approached by Cummins in May 1989,according to Yutaka Murata, an executive in Kubota's enginedivision.   The proposed tie-up closely resembled so-called stableshareholder relationships among Japanese concerns. It wasattractive to Kubota because of Cummins' extensive businessnetwork in Europe, where Kubota hopes to strengthen itspresence before the market is unified in 1992. The twocompanies already are looking into joint manufacturing of15-to-100 horsepower diesel engines in the United Kingdom orin Spain, partly to supply the tractors Kubota now builds inSpain and the small construction equipment it makes in WestGermany, according to Mr. Murata.   Despite the attention attracted by Kubota's high-techforay, its less-glamorous industrial lines continue toaccount for the vast bulk of its revenue and its earnings. Ona consolidated basis, Kubota's revenue rose to 839 billionyen (about $5.67 billion) for its fiscal year that endedMarch 31, from 736.8 billion a year earlier. Net income,meanwhile, fell to 7.6 billion yen from 18.4 billion yen --partly because of costs associated with its U.S. investments.   Kubota's computer subsidiary outside of Tokyo, whichbuilds graphics supercomputers designed by Stardent andminicomputers for Mips, hopes this year to double the 7billion yen in revenue achieved last year. The unit,established in 1987, also aims to turn a profit for the firsttime this year, according to a Kubota spokesman. The companysays it hopes to increase total revenue from high-technologybusinesses to 10% to 15% of overall revenue by the year 2000,from less than 5% now.   In the near future, securities analysts say, Kubota islikely to reap more benefits from increased spending onJapan's infrastructure, which lags well behind that of mostdeveloped countries. The company is a major supplier of pipesfor waterworks and sewage systems. And its 4.95 millionsquare meters in landholdings includes a large tract in Osakathat is scheduled for redevelopment in connection with thenew Kansai airport.   But Kubota is determined to remake its image as it headsinto its second century. The company in April shortened itsJapanese name to K.K. Kubota from Kubota Iron Works K.K., andhired a New York firm to design a new logo -- in Romanletters.   ---   William M. Bulkeley in Boston contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
