<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-20-0266 </DOCNO><TEXT>The stabilization of low level liquid waste (LLLW) from nuclear powerplants with cement based formulations is routinely performed in an efficient,safe and cost-effective manner. The stable waste form is subsequentlyburied in a government regulated shallow land burial site. The wastegenerated at Oak Ridge and stored in the Melton Valley Storage Tanksis dissimilar in several respects to nuclear station waste. The ORNLwaste has a high pH and contains a large concentration of nitrates. Suchcharacteristics can affect the long term stability of the LN solidifiedproduct. The development of a stabilization formula is normally performedusing a non-radioactive surrogate waste form. This procedure, approvedby the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, eliminates any radiation exposuresto laboratory personnel and any radioactive waste during the qualificationperiod. It is important, therefore, to formulate a surrogate waste whichsimulates the actual waste. The MMES staff at ORNL identified a surrogatewaste form which is described in detail in Attachment 3. Included inthis attachment is the ``recipe'' to produce the surrogate waste developedby MMES/ORNL and followed by LN laboratory personnel. 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
