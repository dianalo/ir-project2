 In the past 30years, there have been many computer-based developments for translationbetween different languages such as English, German, French, and Russian.andO;After an initial phase of enthusiastic work, research in Machine Translation(MT) reached its lowest ebb with the release of the highly critical AutomaticLanguage Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report [1] in 1964.andP;  The workin this area was revitalized after the introduction of AI-based techniques.andO;Whereas the earlier attempts were primarily based on syntactic knowledge, thepresent-day research is directed toward the use of semantic and pragmaticknowledge as well [5].andM;The use of AI-based approaches implies understanding the text beforetranslating it.andP;  The program modules implementing this approach are foranalyzing a sentence, for understanding the meaning, and for storing it in alanguage-free form called a semantic map.andP;  The semantic maps are used infurther processing of the sentences for automatic translation,query-answering, and retrieval of NL database items.andP;  Thus, in this method ofimplementation, basically there are two stages of processing.andP;  The first oneis analysis, which transforms the text into a semantic map, and the secondone is the generation, which translates the map into a sentence in a naturallanguage.andP;  These modules are called analyzer and generator, respectively.andM;The analyzers and generators are language-dependent modules.andP;  India is amultilingual country and has about 24 languages in daily use.andP;  In astraightforward implementation, translation from one to another among these24 languages will imply the requirement of 24 x 23 = 552 differenttranslation modules as shown in Figure 1.andM;On the other hand, if one can have a single semantic representation as anoutput of any of the analyzers, one will only need 48 different modules asshown in Figure 2.andP;  Half of them are for analysis and the other half forgeneration.andP;  An implementation based on this type of an approach is referredto as interlingual.andP;  In this article, we discuss the relevant common featuresof some of these languages, which have influenced our approach totranslation, and present our method of the implementation of translation fromTamil to Hindi (two of the Indian languages), for a specific application.andO;The generalized nature of our approach and the common features of theselanguages suggest a possibly easy extension of our technique to otherapplication domains as well as to other Indian languages.andM;SELECTION OF A REPRESENTATION FORMALISMandM;Early MT systems were based on syntactic parsing, which essentially used afixed syntactic structure.andP;  The generator used the parse tree and produced asyntactically valid sentence.andP;  These methods largely failed as the meaningcontent was not properly conveyed from the source sentence to the targetsentence.andP;  The emphasis was more on the structure, i.e., on syntax.andP;  Thewell-known example of this category is the system developed about 20 yearsago at Georgetown University [4].andP;  When that system translated the Englishsentence &quot;The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak&quot; into Russian and thenback to English, the resultant sentence was &quot;The wine is agreeable, but themeat has spoiled.&quot; The present-day Al approaches are based on semantics inorder to overcome the deficiencies that resulted in those meaninglesstranslations.andP;  These approaches imply that understanding the meaning of asentence is essential to representing it, preferably using a language-freeformalism, before it can be translated.andM;There are different kinds of semantic representations.andP;  The choice generallydepends on the application.andP;  For example, Winograd [14] used MICROPLANNER,which is a representational language capable of describing database queriesor procedures.andP;  It was highly effective in his system, which understood thequestions and orders given to a robot acting in a world of moveable blocks.andO;This kind of representation, however, is not suited for situations describedby declarative statements.andM;Another form of representation makes use of the predicate calculus.andP;  This isideally suited for theorem-proving programs [8].andP;  Once the input query ororder is translated into a propositional form, the response to the query inthe form of a reply or an action can be inferred.andP;  The predicate calculus,however, is not well-suited for the representation of approximate orambiguous cases, which are a part of the natural languages.andM;Conceptual Dependency (CD) proposed by Schank [12] has, as its basic unit,the conceptualization that consists of an action and some links with objectstaking part in the action.andP;  The built-in primitives in CD are used torepresent an action and the objects involved in the action.andP;  CD is anexcellent method of a representation of statements describing the everydayevents.andP;  The main drawback of CD is the need for developing independentconceptualizations for each occurrence of a single concept, for instance,&quot;purchase&quot; in a business application or &quot;go&quot; in a travel aid.andP;  Further, thededicated symbols of CD and the actions associated with those symbols makethe CD-based representation difficult to read.andM;Another type of general-purpose representation scheme is based on the use offrames.andP;  In this scheme, an object is described by a list of ordered pairs.andO;Each pair consists of the name of an attribute and its value.andP;  The value maybe a constant or may be a list by itself.andP;  Thus it is possible to representan object or a sentence using as complex a structure as is necessary.andP;  Arepresentation of this kind is fairly well-suited for a variety ofapplication domains.andP;  There are a number of implementations that use frames,such as Bobrow's GUS [3] and commentaries on CHESS [7], just to name two.andP;  Aframe structure can be custom-specified for a particular domain by changingthe attribute names and their value characteristics.andP;  The use of frames,however, also has certain drawbacks.andM;In frames as well as in predicate calculus, the elements associated with themsuch as the nature of attributes or the values of the attributes, must bedefined a priori.andP;  Schank's CD formalism includes these-to a large extent inthe form of primitives.andP;  In spite of such disadvantages, we chose theframe-based representation for our implementation since it permitted us todefine the attributes that could be tailored to a particular domain ofapplication, which was our main concern.andM;The domain of discourse considered in our case is a typical conversationcarried out across enquiry counters in railway stations, used by people fromdifferent language-speaking states of India.andP;  A study was carried out tocollect the pattern of the commonly generated queries and responses.andP;  Apreliminary analysis was carried out on a set of 12 types of sentences, whichwas later extended to 15 additional types of sentences.andP;  It was furtherextended to a total of 45 types of sentences.andP;  In the following sections,after discussing the motivation for our approach, we describe how thesesentences were analyzed and stored, using frames and how this frame structurewas used to generate the target language sentence.andM;THE LINGUISTIC MOTIVATION FOR OUR APPROACHandM;In this section, representative examples from eight different Indianlanguages are presented.andP;  Through these examples, we show how certainlinguistic features provided the necessary motivation for the work reportedin this article.andM;The two examples given below are sentences in the languages Tamil (T), Telugu(U), Kannada (K), Malayalam (M), Hindi (H), Punjabi (P), Gujarathi (G), andBengali (B).andP;  Of these languages the first four belong to the category ofDravidian languages (spoken in the southern part of India), and the last fourare Indo-European languages (spoken in the northern part).andP;  The correspondingEnglish (E) sentences have been included here, for the benefit of thereaders.andP;  The verbs in each of the sentences are italicized.andP;  The Indianlanguage sentences appearing in this article use the displayable,transliterated codes developed in-house [2].andM;(1)  E:   I will go to Delhi tomorrow.andM;T:   ndaan ndaalzi kaali tellekku poovaaen.andM;U:   naenu raepu daelle vaelthaanu.andM;K:   naanu naalzae daellegae hogthene.andM;M:   ghyaan naalae daellelotu pogum.andM;H:   mi kal delle jaauungaa.andM;P:   mi kal delle jaavaangaa.andM;G:   huu kaalae delle jaauu cuu.andM;B:   ame agamekal delle jabo.andM;(2)  E:   By which train do you want to go to Bombay?andM;T:   ndeengkalz pampaaykku aendtha traeyenelandM;pooka verumpukedrrerkalz?andM;U:   ae trayenlo meeru baambae vaellalanuandM;kunthunnaauu?andM;K:   nemagae, yaava trayenalle baambaegaeandM;hogabaekku?andM;M:   aetdu trayenel aanu baambaeyelotu poogaanandM;vaendeyathu?andM;H:   aap kes traeyense baambae jaanaa caahthae hin?andM;P:   thuse kaede gaade thae baambae jaanaa vi?andM;G:   ki traeyense thamaarae baambae jaauu cae?andM;B:   kon traeyen korae aapnae baambae jaethaeandM;chaan?andM;Although we referred to two different categories of languages, there areperceptible common features in the linguistic constructs, which we have madeuse of.andP;  We should hasten to add that though these languages are classifiedone way or the other, it does not mean that familiarity with one languageimplies easy learning of another language, even if both languages belong tothe same class.andP;  While talking about common features, we refer to thesyntactic aspects of the sentence constructs.andM;A cursory glance of the sample sentences shows that the occurrence of a verb(or the verbs) is at or towards the end of these sentences.andP;  In the case of atwo-verb sentence, the first is the main verb, and the second is an auxiliaryverb.andP;  We considered a total of 45 typical queries or statements relevant toour specific application.andP;  Two have been shown here.andP;  These are noted fortheir characteristic structural simplicity.andP;  As we will discuss in thefollowing sections, the verbs are generally in their inflected forms and arerich in information.andP;  It is true of the nouns also, though to a lesserextent.andP;  The verb inflections not only give information about the tense butalso the gender and number.andP;  Because the verbs contain a lot of informationand they occur as sentence-final words in simple sentences, we adopted averb-centered formalism [9].andP;  This also provided us with a mechanism to dealwith complex sentences, where verbs may occur in places other than toward theend of the sentences.andP;  Whatever the nature of the sentences, we use verbs asphrase markers, and we confine the initial processing to phrase levels [2].andM;We would like to state two other points.andP;  First, the case inflectionsdisambiguate the semantic content of the sentences.andP;  For instance, theEnglish sentence &quot;I saw a man on the hill with the telescope&quot; has threedifferent sentence constructs in Indian languages-each specifically indicateswhether the telescope was used to spot a man, whether the man had atelescope, or whether the telescope was installed on a hill [2].andP;  What isimportant to note is that the case inflections in Indian languages do notpermit the construction of a sentence as ambiguous as the sample Englishsentence is.andP;  The case inflections thus allow different sequencing of wordsin a given sentence, while preserving the semantics intact.andP;  We refer to thisfeature as a relatively free word ordering in a sentence.andP;  The second pointis that sentences with passive-voice constructs are of academic interestonly.andP;  They exist only in literature and are seldom used in conversations.andO;Use of this feature, if at all, will depend on the domain of application.andM;The verb-centered approaches for translation may have originated mainlybecause the verbs indicate specific actions and, hence, play a key role in asentence.andP;  As we saw earlier, this approach is very effective in the case ofIndian languages for other reasons too.andP;  Thus analysis of sentences startswith the process of verb spotting.andP;  Organizing the language-specificmaterials in terms of dictionaries, the procedure for analysis becomesgeneralized.andP;  It consists of calling the relevant sets of dictionaries forthe appropriate languages and of constructing a representational structure,which is largely language free.andP;  Similarly, the procedure for generationconsists of looking into the target dictionary for translation of the rootwords in the structure and of interpreting other entries in the structure interms of target language-specific constructs.andP;  With language-specific modulesseparated in this way, the remaining part of the translation module is madeportable for different languages.andP;  Based on this approach, our group isinvolved in developing a multilingual translation system, called TAMIL [10].andO;In this regard the results presented in this article have been quiteencouraging.andP;  We will look at the details of the analyzer.andM;THE ANALYZERandM;The function of an analyzer is to extract and preserve the meaning of thesentences in the chosen semantic representational form.andP;  The techniques usedby an analyzer depend on the following factors.andP;  The first is the length ofthe text.andP;  We restrict our analysis to individual sentences, as thiscomprises the majority of the queries/responses.andP;  Each sentence is analyzedindependently, with the result being that a previous sentence does not affectthe interpretation of the following sentence.andP;  The second factor is the scopeof application.andP;  Developing an analyzer that accepts all types of sentencesfor any kind of application is a very ambitious goal.andP;  Hence we chose aspecific domain of application.andP;  The third one is the degree of tolerance forerrors in the input.andP;  Since we aim to preserve the meaning content of theinput sentence, stylistic constructs are ignored, and additional adjectives,which do not affect the meaning of the sentences, are not processed.andP;  Thisimplies that ill-formed inputs may also be accepted.andP;  In the case ofambiguous translations, the multiple translated outputs can be fed to theuser for interactive validation or selection.andM;Our analyzer functions in two steps.andP;  The first is the syntactic analysis,which is the morphological analysis that extracts the root word from itsinflected form.andP;  The second step is concerned with the representationbuilding, which leads to a frame-like structure describing the meaningcontent of the input sentence.andP;  These two modules operate in an overlappedmanner rather than the conventional sequential way where the semanticanalysis is performed on the parse tree generated from the syntax analysis.andO;Strictly speaking our syntactic analyzer does not build a parse tree or anyother syntactic structure at all.andP;  The principle of its working is similar tothat of Riesbeck's analyzer [13].andM;MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYZERandM;The input to this module is a sequence of characters and a dictionary name.andO;The module returns the information about whether the given sequence is avalid member in the specified dictionary, and the various characteristics ofthe valid word, such as the gender, number, and tense.andM;In our implementation, the vocabulary has been distributed over ninedictionaries in order to resolve the syntactic ambiguities.andP;  Thesedictionaries contain the words belonging to the categories of:andM;(1)  VERBSandM;(2)  NOUNSandM;(3)  ADJECTIVESandM;(4)  ADVERBSandM;(5)  PRONOUNSandM;(6)  PLACESandM;(7)  COUNTandM;(8)  QUERY WORDSandM;(9)  TIMEandM;Each of these dictionaries contains a root word, its inflections, and themeaning of the root.andP;  In the preliminary version of the implementation, theapproach was based on identifying the gender and the tense of the root word.andO;This method was preferred over the method that stores all the grammaticalcategories due to the inflection of the words in the dictionary, because ofthe heavily case-inflected nature of the Indian languages.andP;  The Indianlanguages, specifically Tamil, have a morphological construct as Root +Sandhi + Inflections.andP;  In this construct, Sandhi denotes the tenseinformation while the case inflections denote the gender and number.andP;  Forexample, when the word caelkeraan is split using the morphological rules, itresults in the following structure.andM;caelkeraan= cael           + /*Root:      denotes ACTION*/andM;keru       + /*Sandhi:    denotes PRESENTandM;TENSE*/andM;aan          /*Infl.:     denotes IllandM;PERSON,andM;SINGULAR*/andM;Similarly,andM;caelvaarkalz = cael      + /*Root:       denotes ACTION*/andM;v          + /*Sandhi:     denotes FUTUREandM;TENSE*/andM;aarkazl       /Infl.:      denotes IIIandM;PERSON,andM;PLURAL*/andM;THE REPRESENTATION BUILDERandM;The morphological analyzer we have described operates as a tool to theanalyzer.andP;  Based on the verb-centered approach for the development of thesemantic representation, the input sentence is first split into phrases.andP;  Theterm &quot;phrase&quot; as we refer to is different from the conventional noun/verbphrases (NP-VP).andP;  A phrase in our case is marked by the verbs [2].andP;  Theportion of a sentence that is to the left of a verb or between two verbs istermed a phrase.andP;  The analysis is then restricted to individual phrases in asentence.andP;  Thus, a simple sentence likeandM;Ndaan ndaalzikku poovaaen                                    1)andM;(I will go tomorrow)andM;is treated as a single phrase, whereas the sentenceandM;Ndaan ndaalzikku pooka verumpukedraaen                      (2)andM;(I wish to go tomorrow)andM;is split into two phrases, asandM;(1) Ndaan ndaalzikku pookaandM;(2) VerumpukedraaenandM;The second sentence contains two inflected verbs, pooka and vertimpukedraaen.andO;The analyzer initially builds a frame representation for each of the twophrases and combines them later to produce a final representation.andP;  The firstphrase in sentence (2) is treated as the main phrase.andP;  The second phrase,which consists only of a verb, acts as an additional qualifier for the mainverb and, hence, it simply gets appended to the main phrase.andM;The analyzer also makes predictions about what is likely to be encounteredfollowing the word it is currently studying.andP;  Because of the freeword-ordering characteristics of the Indian languages, however, thisprediction is not strictly adhered to, i.e., there can be a set of categoriesin the prediction list instead of a single category.andP;  If it has predictedsomething and if that prediction is among the possibilities for a word, thenit is driven by the predictions related to the newly accepted word.andP;  If thereare no expectations with the new word, it continues the processing of theprediction list of the old word.andP;  With the following example, we demonstratethe stage-by-stage analysis of an input sentence.andM;Ndeengalz aentha traeyenel pooka verumbukereerkalz?andM;(By which train do you wish to go?)andM;By our definition of the phrase, this is a two-phrase sentence.andP;  The firststep in the analysis is to spot the main verb.andP;  Since, in a conversation ofthis nature, a sentence does not generally begin with a verb, the analyzersearches for the presence of a verb from the second word on.andP;  In the abovesentence, it encounters the inflected verb pooka (to go).andP;  The morphologicalanalyzer decodes this word and returns the root, sandhi, and the inflectionalforms together with the meaning of the root word.andP;  The analyzer thengenerates the representation by filling the predefined slots of the framestructure for the given root word.andP;  The choice of this frame is based on themeaning of the root word.andP;  These slots hold the possible information alongwith this root.andP;  Since the position of the verb delimits a phrase, thissentence is split into two phrases.andP;  The analyzer then concentrates on thefirst phrase.andP;  Special symbols that correspond to query or exclamation, forexample, are treated as belonging to the whole sentence and not as parts ofany phrase.andP;  Whenever they are encountered, analysis of the first phrasegenerally starts with these symbols.andP;  The slots in the frame are formed as aprediction list.andP;  Thus the first entry in this list is the query.andM;A sentence is classified as a query if it contains a query word and if itends with a question mark.andP;  In the initial phase of implementation, a querysearch in the prediction list is honored only if the sentence had ended witha question mark.andP;  As in this example, a search for a match with a query wordis performed.andP;  The query dictionary, which contains all the query-relatedwords, is used for the search, and this returns a success on encountering theword aentha (which).andP;  The spotting of this query creates another predictionlist that is generated by the built-in grammar rule base.andP;  This ruleindicates that the word next to aentha must be a noun, which is classified asthe query object.andP;  In this example, it matches with the word traeyenel.andP;  Acase analysis of this noun deciphers this word as Train and the relation ofthis noun with the query as In.andP;  The next item in the prediction list is theagent.andP;  The search in the pronouns dictionary identifies the agent.andP;  Thisbuilds the semantic representation gradually and ends up with a phrase levelrepresentation as Figure 3 shows.andM;The second phrase of the sentence contains only the auxiliary verb thatdescribes the mood of the sentence.andP;  Hence, it is appended to therepresentation without any special link to the first phrase.andP;  The associatednumber, gender, and tense categories are checked for validity and added inthe final representation as shown in Figure 4.andM;Consider the following sentence.andM;Ndaan naalzi kaali thamelnaatu aeksperassel  (3) tellekku poovaaen.andM;(Tomorrow morning, I will go to Delhi by Tamilnadu express.)andM;After the phrase identification process, during the left-oriented analysis,the analyzer selects the frame structure given in Figure 5 for the verb poo.andO;Some of the slots have a number of predefined sub-slots.andM;The analyzer then identifies &quot;Delhi&quot; as the destination station.andP;  Next, whenit encounters the word 'express:' it creates a prediction list and adds thetrain name to it.andP;  Then, using the stations dictionary, it checks whether theprevious word is a valid name of a train.andP;  If it encounters a match, itqualifies the express with this name and categorizes it as the name of thetrain; otherwise, it returns to the calling routine, which has Time pendingin its prediction list.andP;  Hence, the search in the left part of the main verbcontinues, and the analyzer recognizes the words naalzi and kaali astime-related words and adds them to the frame structure.andM;As is evident from the example, in this approach, the majority of theambiguities are skipped over before they are noticed.andP;  It also implies theacceptability of certain ill-formed sentences by the analyzer.andP;  This will beuseful in those cases in which the human inputs are directly used, sincethere are possibilities for encountering syntactically imperfect sentences ina conversation.andM;The behavior of the program, developed on the basis of this approach, dependsessentially on the dictionaries and their formats.andP;  The knowledge base isvery much part of the dictionary, and the program merely interprets theentries associated with the words present in the phrase.andP;  This gives enormousflexibility during system development and modification.andP;  The same approachcan be used for different languages for different domains by changing onlythe dictionaries and the language-dependent parts of the analyzer module.andO;These modules use the grammar rules of the respective languages in buildingthe semantic representation of a sentence.andM;NL GENERATIONandM;Natural language generation is the dual problem of analysis.andP;  The output ofan analyzer, which is in some form of semantic representation, is the inputto a generator.andP;  The generator produces a text in the target language, makinguse of the meaning as given by the representation structure built by theanalyzer.andP;  Several problems arise in this transformation.andP;  These issues areexplained in detail in the paper on the well-known King's NL generator [6].andM;First, one should know whether it is necessary to translate every bit ofinformation or to make a selection of information before translation.andP;  Thesemantic map can be a very detailed one and, when reproduced, can be anexcessively long text containing a lot of unnecessary information.andP;  This isthe converse of the inference phase in which one has to explicitly add theimplicit facts.andP;  Second, there is the problem of defining the detailedstructure of the text to be generated.andP;  The generator has to set the words inthe right order, keep track of agreements, and construct the appropriate formof each word.andM;The main objectives in our work areandM;(1)  to translate the meaning conveyed by a sentence inandM;one language to another, giving less importance toandM;the style of the sentences andandM;(2)  to study the issues related to NL generation in aandM;limited domain.andM;Hence, we adopt a fixed structure for all the sentences, thereby making useof the relatively free word-ordering nature of the Indian languages.andP;  Theheart of the NL generation module is also the set of dictionaries.andP;  Thedictionary organization for a natural language analyzer, however, is quitedifferent from that needed for the NL generator.andP;  In the former, we analyze agiven word and, hence, we need more morphological rules and information abouteach of the inflections.andP;  In the latter, we have information about what toconvey, and we have to generate the appropriate word or words using themorphological rules.andP;  The words constructed must be checked for number andgender agreements.andP;  Further, the language-specific additions/deletionscorresponding to the presence/absence of a word are to be incorporated.andM;In our implementation we use an equal number of dictionaries for generationas we did for analysis.andP;  The representation as a whole is scanned to identifythe characteristics of the main verb.andP;  This way, the NL generator alsoemploys a verb-centered strategy.andM;Instead of directly using the semantic representation built by the analyzer,our system passes it through a representation modifier and uses the modifiedrepresentation for synthesis.andP;  This modifier uses an intermediate language totarget the language dictionary and translates the root word and a few entriesin the representational structure.andP;  This approach helps in two ways:andM;(1)   The synthesizer needs to handle only the targetandM;language-specific constructs, and it need not beandM;concerned with the intermediate languageandM;constructs.andM;(2)   The dictionary organization for the synthesizer isandM;made simpler since the synthesizer dictionary hasandM;to contain only the morphological constructsandM;related to a specific word.andM;The modified representation of the sentence, for the target language ofHindi, is shown in Figure 6.andM;The number and gender information related to each root word is used to accessa three-dimensional dictionary that contains the inflections corresponding tothe various gender/number/tense.andP;  This procedure is continued for all aspectsof the representation, and the inflected forms of the individual words aregenerated.andP;  These words are then combined to form a syntactically validconstruct according to a rule base, which lists the allowable syntacticordering.andP;  This approach was tested for the representation of all thesentences produced by the analyzer and was found to work successfully.andP;  Thefinal Hindi sentence, synthesized from the representation in Figure 6, isandM;aap kes train se jaanaa caahthae hin?andM;The only discouraging feature of this approach is the huge size of thethree-dimensional dictionary, which contains all the possible inflections.andM;FUTURE DIRECTIONSandM;Further work is directed toward a general formalism for synthesizing thewords based on a rule specification.andP;  Since the inflections in Indianlanguages modify the root word, in most of the cases, in contrast with thoseof European languages, there may only be a limited success in this direction.andO;Currently we are working on extending our phrase level approach forrelatively more complex input sentences, as well as for other source-targetlanguage pairs.andP;  Ultimately, since a system of this nature should prove itsworth in the field, our thoughts are also focused on the development ofappropriate hardware modules for the implementation of the system.andM;SUMMARYandM;An approach based on AI techniques for building the semantic representationfor simple sentences was considered.andP;  It is based on a verb-centered,left-oriented, phrase level approach, and it focuses on the meaning of theinput sentence for building a representational structure.andP;  The phrase asidentified in our approach is different from the more widely known NP(noun-phrase)-VP (verb-phrase).andP;  In our approach, a verb is the delimiter ofa phrase.andP;  The heavily inflected verbs in Indian languages lend support tothis idea.andP;  Of the conventional knowledge representation formalisms, theframe structure is used for representing the meaning of a sentence.andP;  Thislanguage-free representation is used by the NL generator to produce thetarget language sentence after appropriate transformations.andP;  The system hasbeen designed and tested successfully for a specific application domain andfor a restricted set of sentences.andP;  Our approach, based on phrase levelsemantics, has given rise to a different concept of phrases and has beenshown to work well for Indian languages.andP;  Acknowledgments.andP;  We would like tothank the authorities of I.I.T., Madras, India, for the support extended bythem for this research.andP;
