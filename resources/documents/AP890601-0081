(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Researchers, including two Sovietscientists, intend to sample the sea and air off Washington'snorthern coast, seeking evidence that the Earth may have naturaldefenses against the greenhouse effect.   The 38-member Pacific Stratus Investigation, scheduled to begintoday, will combine three aircraft, a sea-going research vessel,shore-based observations and satellite data to determine if theglobal warming effect caused by carbon dioxide and other gases hasan effect on cloud formation.   The eight U.S. and two Soviet organizations involved want to seeif the Earth's higher temperature leads to greater release by seaplankton of sulfur gases that rise to form the nuclei of clouds.   The scientists hope to gather enough data during the next 10days to allow them to simulate cloud formation in scientific modelsused to recreate the greenhouse effect. Cloud formation is a keyparameter absent in current models.   The initial results will be discussed next fall among theresearchers, and a second sampling effort is scheduled for April1990.   ``It is possible (the Earth) has a natural thermostat built inthat would reduce the temperature naturally,'' project member PeterHobbs, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University ofWashington, told reporters Wednesday.   ``If the Earth's temperature warms, plankton activity mightincrease, which would mean more droplets in clouds that wouldreflect the sun's radiation more, and recool (the Earth),'' he said.   Those involved say the research effort will be the first to testan idea advanced by different scientists but credited mainly toBritish scientist James Lovelock.   The hypothesis holds that Earth warming could increase theactivity of phytoplankton, which release sulfur gases that rise andcondense to form particles called cloud condensation nuclei, theseeds of clouds.   More gases could mean more clouds, and this could mean morenatural blocking of the sun and a cooling effect that couldcompensate for the warming caused by heat retained by excessivecarbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere.   Initial data show the opposite may be true: that the highertemperature could be slowing phytoplankton activity, speeding upthe greenhouse effect.   University of Washington atmospheric chemist Robert Charlson,performing tests in France, found that more sulfur was presentduring the last ice age than during warmer times, indicating thatthe phytoplankton may have accentuated the temperature changesrather than counterbalancing them.   ``We don't know if a change in the activity of the phytoplanktonwill change the radiative properties of clouds,'' Hobbs said.   The Soviets are experts on particle distributions in air anddimethylsulfide, the gas emitted by the phytoplankton that rises toform cloud condensation nuclei.   The immediate aim of the effort is to measure the concentrationof plankton-emitted gases in the ocean's surface waters and atvarious altitudes above it.   This data would then allow scientists to factor cloud formationdata into global climate models.</TEXT></DOC>
