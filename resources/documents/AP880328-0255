Inc. and Campeau Corp., Federated said Monday.   A committee of Federated's outside directors met Monday todetermine bidding procedures and would inform Macy and Campeau ofthose guidelines, Federated said in a statement.   The board's Wednesday meeting was to be held at an undisclosedlocation in New York. Federated has said Edward Finkelstein andRobert Campeau, the chairmen respectively of Macy and Campeau,would be allowed to address the directors.   Macy and Campeau have each offered more than $6 billion to buyFederated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer. Macy's bid has theapproval of Federated management.   In a letter to both suitors, Federated said, ``It is anticipatedthat the board will consider and act on the parties' final bids ata board meeting on Wednesday, March 30. Federated's advisers willcontinue to be available to you to discuss all matters.''   Federated said last week its board would meet this week toconsider Campeau's $6.53 billion offer and a $6.3 billion bid fromMacy.   Robert Campeau, whose Toronto-based company has been tryingsince Jan. 25 to buy Federated, will address Federated's board ifinvited, Ms. Frank said.   ``I'm sure he will go. Nothing's been firmed up, at thispoint,'' she said.   Macy, based in New York, had no comment, said spokesman JamesFingeroth.   Federated disclosed last week it was negotiating with Macy aboutan improved Macy offer, but said there was no guaranteenegotiations would be successful.   Campeau last week raised its two-step, all-cash offer toapproximately $73 a share from $68 a share, or $6.18 billion.Campeau offered to pay $82 each for 70.5 million Federated sharesand $37 for the remainder of Federated's 89.5 million outstandingshares in a subsequent merger. Campeau also extended its deadlineuntil midnight EDT April 4, when Macy's offer is to expire.   Campeau, a development company that bought Allied Stores Corp.in December 1986, also proposed an alternate friendly merger underwhich it would pay $73 a share for 70.5 million shares in a tenderoffer and $73 for the remaining shares after the merger.   Macy has offered $77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 millionFederated shares, for a total of $5.4 billion. Macy would exchangeshares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securitiesfor the remainder of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares.   Federated and Macy have signed a merger agreement under whichMacy would take over Federated in a newly formed, joint company.   Federated's divisions include Bloomingdale's, Abraham andStraus, Burdine's, Filene's, Foley's, Lazarus and Rich's departmentstores; Ralphs supermarkets; Gold Circle discount stores; and MainStreet and Children's Place specialty stores.   Federated has also delayed putting into effect, until at leastWednesday, a ``poison pill'' amendment to its shareholder rightsplan. That would allow shareholders to buy new shares at a steepdiscount and make an unwanted takeover more expensive.</TEXT></DOC>
