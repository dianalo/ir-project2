In support of this program we plan the synthesis ofa number of water-soluble well defined block- or star block colopymerscapable of effectively viscosifying their solutions through reversiblecrosslinking. In order to understand the effects on the rheology of branchingor cyclization in the above systems, we also plan the synthesis of water-solublecyclic- and star polymers.</TEXT></DOC>
