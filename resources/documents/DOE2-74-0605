Canada hasmany biomass sources: forests, agriculture, aquatic environments, industrialand household wastes. Many diverse technologies have been developed toprovide energy from the variety of biomass feedstocks available, anddiffering physical characteristics of the available feedstocks. Biomassis considered to include the production, conversion and utilization ofwood, municipal, agrifood and other industrial organic wastes, and peathas supplied about 7% of Canada's overall primary energy demand. Theprograms developed in the past ten years to encourage good stewardshipof biomass resources include the Forest Industry Renewable Energy (FIRE)program, Canadian Oil Substitution program (COSP), Alternative EnergyDevelopment program (AEDP), Energy from the Forest (ENFOR) program, Conservationand Renewable Energy Demonstration (CREDA) program and the BioenergyDevelopment Program. In addition to describing these programs, a breakdownof research programs by province is provided. 6 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
