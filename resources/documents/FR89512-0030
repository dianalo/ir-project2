It further prescribes the responsibilities of the contractor, theauditor, and the contracting officer regarding the assessment, demonstration,evaluation, and correction of deficiencies in a contractor's MMAS.<ITAG tagnum="80">242.7202 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>``Contractor'', for purposes of this subpart, means a business unit asdefined in FAR 31.001. ``Material Management and Accounting System'' (MMAS), as used in this subpart,means the contractor's system(s) for planning, controlling, and accountingfor the acquisition, use, and disposition of material. MMAS's may be manualor automated and they may be integrated with planning, engineering, estimating,purchasing, inventory, and/or accounting systems, etc., or they may beessentially stand-alone systems. ``Valid Time-Phased Requirements'' means material which is:  (a) Needed to fulfill the production plan, including reasonable quantitiesfor scrap, shrinkage, yield, etc., and  (b) Is charged/billed to contracts or other cost objectives in a mannerconsistent with their need to fulfill the production plan. <ITAG tagnum="80">242.7203 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>It is the policy of the Department of Defense that all contractors havea MMAS that reasonably forecasts material requirements, assures the costsof purchased and fabricated material charged or allocated to a contractare based on valid time-phased requirements, and maintains a consistent,equitable, and unbiased logic for costing of material transactions. Toassist contractors to comply with this policy, standards for MMAS's areprescribed at 242.7206. The Government has no preference among the variousautomated or manual systems, or among various methods of material transfer/allocation,as long as the contractor's MMAS complies with the standards at 242.7206.<ITAG tagnum="80">242.7204 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability. </ITAG>(a) All contractors who receive prime contracts, other than contracts awardedunder the set-aside procedures of FAR Part 19, greater than the small purchasethreshold set forth in FAR 13.000 and which are either (1) cost-reimbursementcontracts, or (2) fixed-price contracts with progress or other financingpayments, are expected to have a MMAS which conforms to the standards at242.7206. (b) The specific requirements of sections 242.7207 and 242.7208 apply toany large business contractor which in its preceding fiscal year receivedDoD prime contracts or subcontracts totaling $50 million or more. (c) For a large business contractor not meeting the criteria in paragraph(b) of this section but which in its preceding fiscal year received DoDprime contracts or subcontracts totaling $10 million or more, the PCO mayrequire compliance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of the clause at 252.245-7001with the concurrence, or at the request, of the ACO when such complianceis in the best interest of the Government (e.g., significant material managementand accounting system deficiencies are believed to exist). (d) The demonstration and evaluation requirements of sections 242.7207and 242.7208 do not apply to small businesses, educational institutions,or nonprofit organizations. <ITAG tagnum="80">242.7205 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibilities. </ITAG>(a) Contracting officers should note that the standards at 242.7206 andthe enforcement requirements at 242.7208 are broadly worded and requirethe exercise of sound judgment to achieve effective implementation. Furthermore,this subpart requires careful coordination, communication, and understandingamong the DCCA auditor, the contractor, and the ACO staff. (b) Contractors shall assess their MMAS's and take reasonable action tocomply with the standards at 242.7206. (c) Contractors meeting the requirements in 242.7204 (b) or (c) shall,in accordance with 242.7207, disclose their MMAS to the cognizant ACO andshall, upon the request of the ACO, demonstrate the degree to which theirMMAS complies with the standards at 242.7206. (d) The ACO will neither approve nor disapprove a contractor's MMAS, butonly determine whether it adequately conforms to the standards set forthin 242.7206. However, the approval requirements of FAR 32.503-15(d) and52.245-5(d) are met when the ACO has determined that the MMAS conformsto the standard at 242.7206(b)(7). ACO blanket approval of cost transfersbetween contracts should be contingent upon the contractor retaining recordsof the transfer activity that took place in the prior month and reporting,at least monthly, a summary of the transfer activity that took place inthe prior month. The summary report should include as a minimum, the totalnumber of transfers and their dollar value. (e) For a contractor meeting the requirements in 242.7204 (b) or (c) above,the cognizant ACO shall determine the adequacy of the contractor's MMASand pursue appropriate corrections of deficiencies. (f) On behalf of the ACO, the cognizant auditor will advise and assistthe ACO in evaluating both the contractor's MMAS and the contractor's correctionof any deficiencies thereto. Auditors shall assess the significance ofcontractor deficiencies and provide the ACO an estimate of the adversematerial impact to the Government resulting from such deficiencies. <ITAG tagnum="80">242.7206 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Material management and accounting system standards.</ITAG>(a) MMAS's must have adequate internal accounting and administrative controlsto assure system and data integrity.  (b) MMAS's must comply with the following:  (1) Have an adequate system description including policies, procedures,and operating instructions complaint with the FAR and DFARS.  (2) Assure that costs of purchased and fabricated material charged or allocatedto a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements as impacted byminimum/economic order quantity restrictions. A 98-percent bill of materialaccuracy and a 95-percent master production schedule accuracy are desirableas a goal in order to assure that requirements are both valid and appropriatelytime-phased. If systems have accuracy levels below those above, the contractormust demonstrate that (i) there is no material harm to the Government dueto lower accuracy levels, and/or (ii) the cost to meet the accuracy goalsis excessive in relation to the impact on the Government.  (3) Provide a mechanism to identify, report, and resolve system controlweaknesses and manual overrides. Systems should identify operational exceptionssuch as excess/residual inventory as soon as known.  (4) Provide audit trails and maintain records necessary to evaluate systemlogic and to verify through transaction testing that the system is operatingas desired. Both manual records and those in machine readable form willbe maintained for the prescribed record retention periods.  (5) Establish and maintain adequate levels of record accuracy, and includereconciliation of recorded inventory quantities to physical inventory bypart number on a periodic basis. A 95-percent accuracy level is desirable.If systems have an accuracy level below 95 percent, the contractor mustdemonstrate that (i) there is no material harm to the Government due tolower accuracy level, and/or (ii) the cost to meet the accuracy goal isexcessive in relation to the impact on the Government.  (6) Provide detailed description(s) of circumstances which will resultin manual or system generated transfers of parts.  (7) Maintain a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for costing ofmaterial transactions. The contractor will maintain and disclose a writtenpolicy describing the transfer methodologies. The costing methodology maybe standard or actual cost, or any of the inventory costing methods inFAR 30.411-50(b). Consistency must be maintained across all contract andcustomer types, and from accounting period to accounting period for initialcharging and transfer charging.  (i) The system should transfer parts and associated costs within the samebilling period.(ii) In the few circumstances where it may not be appropriate to transferparts and associated costs within the same billing period, use of a ``loan/payback''technique must be approved by the ACO. When the technique is used, theremust be controls to ensure that parts are paid back expeditiously; proceduresand controls are in place to correct any overbilling that might occur;at a minimum, the borrowing contract and the date the part was borrowedare identified monthly; and the cost of the replacement part is chargedto the borrowing contract.(8) Where allocations from common inventory accounts are used, have controlsin addition to the requirements of standards in paragraphs (b) (2) and(7) above to ensure that:(i) Reallocations and any credit due are processed no less frequently thanthe routine billing cycle;(ii) Inventories retained for requirements which are not under contractare not allocated to contracts;(iii) Algorithms are maintained based on valid and current data.(9) Notwithstanding FAR 45.505-3(f)(2)(ii), have adequate controls to ensurethat physically commingled inventories that may include material for whichcosts are charged or allocated to fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, andcommercial contracts do not compromise requirements of any of the abovestandards.(10) Be subjected to periodic internal audits to ensure compliance withestablished policies and procedures.<ITAG tagnum="80">242.7207</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">System disclosure, demonstration, and maintenance requirements.</ITAG>(a) A MMAS disclosure is adequate when the contractor has provided thecognizant ACO documentation which accurately describes those policies,procedures, and practices that the contractor currently uses in its MMASin sufficient detail for the Government to reasonably make an informedjudgment regarding the adequacy of the contractor's MMAS.(b) A MMAS demonstration is adequate when the contractor has provided thecognizant ACO sufficient evidence to demonstrate the degree of conformanceof its MMAS to the standards at 242.7206, including an estimate of thecost impact to the Government of any significant deficiencies and a comprehensiveplan for correcting any significant deficiencies.(c) Significant changes to the MMAS must be disclosed to the cognizantACO within 30 days of their implementation.(d) If the contractor notifies the Government representative to whom theinformation is submitted, i.e., the ACO or the auditor, that disclosedinformation relative to its MMAS contains commercial or financial informationwhich it regards as privileged and confidential, such information shallbe protected and shall not be released outside the Government without thepermission of the contractor.

Evaluations and reports shall be accomplished as a contractaudit and contract administration office team effort. The ACO shall appointa team leader and ensure representation of appropriate functional specialties.Evaluations shall be tailored to take full advantage of the day-to-daywork done as an integral part of both the contract audit and contract administrationactivities. A system evaluation shall be conducted at least every threeyears, except where the ACO, in consultation with the auditor, determinesthat past experience and a current vulnerability assessment of the contractordiscloses low risk. If the ACO determines that the Government is subjectto high risk, MMAS evaluations should be done more frequently. To the extentpossible, the evaluation team leader should inform the contractor and theACO of significant findings during the conduct of the evaluation. The teamleader should apprise the contractor during an exit conference of any significantfindings.(b) <T3>Disposition of Evaluation Team Findings_</T3>(1) <T3>Reporting of Evaluation Team Findings.</T3> The report shall addressthe evaluation team findings and recommendations.

The percentage of the suspension will be impacted by thequality of the contractor's self-assessment, demonstration, and correctiveaction plan. After acceptance of the corrective action plan, but priorto complete implementation, the ACO will reduce the suspension as appropriateto reflect the contractor's progress. In no case, however, will total amountsof affected costs be approved for progress payments or public vouchersuntil the contractor's system is determined to be acceptable for Governmentcontract costing purposes, or the amount of the impact is determined tobe immaterial.(ii) When the report of an evaluation indicates that there is a significantMMAS deficiency, the ACO should ensure that the effect of the deficiency(s)is considered in the review of the contractor's estimating system pursuantto DFARS 215.811.(6) <T3>Notification of ACO Determination. </T3>The ACO will notify the contractorand the auditor of the determination and any decision to reduce or suspendprogress payments or payments under public vouchers. The notice shall identifythe deficiencies requiring correction and will indicate acceptance or rejectionof the contractor's corrective action plan.(7) <T3>Monitoring Contractor's Corrective Action. </T3>The auditor and ACOwill monitor the contractor's progress toward correction of deficiencies.In the event the contractor fails to make adequate progress toward correctiveaction, the ACO shall take further appropriate action to ensure that thecontractor corrects the deficiency. Actions which should be consideredby the ACO include, but are not limited to, bringing the issue to the attentionof higher level management, further reduction or suspension of progresspayments in accordance with FAR 32.503-6, disapproval of the contractor'scost accounting system and/or cost estimating system, and/or recommendationsconcerning award of future contracts.<ITAG tagnum="80">242.7209</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract clause.</ITAG>The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 252.242-7001 in allsolicitations and resulting contracts which are greater than the smallpurchase threshold set forth in FAR 13.101 and are either (a) cost-reimbursementcontracts or (b) are fixed-price contracts with progress or other financingpayments.
