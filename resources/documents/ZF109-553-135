 Users can plug cartridges into the printer, addexpansion boards to the computer, or use software that translatesPostScript into the LaserJet's native PCL format.andP;  Cartridges arethe simplest of these three alternatives and are relativelyinexpensive, but may require additional printer memory.andP;  HP's $695LaserJet PostScript Cartridge adds true Adobe PostScript to theLaserJet IIP, IID, III, and IIID models; Adobe offers a $495PostScript cartridge to the earlier Series II.andP;  The HP unit in aLaserJet III or IIID combines Adobe Type Manager font renderingwith the printer's built-in Resolution Enhancement Technology toimprove the clarity of both text and graphics.andP;  PostScript clonecartridges are available from Pacific Data Products and others.andO;Software PostScript interpreters include UltraScript PC,PreScript, Freedom of Press, and GoScript Plus.andP;  PostScriptcartridges have made most PostScript add-in boards obsolete, butsome newer boards can extend the resolution of a LaserJet to asmuch as 600 dpi.andP;

 If you aren't satisfied withHewlett-Packard's tried-and-true workhorse, you can transform it into athoroughbred PostScript printer.andP;  The transformation won't cost much, and cangive you output that's better than anything you can get from Apple's slow andexpensive PostScript printers.andP;  Best of all, you can still use your machineas an ordinary LaserJet when you don't need PostScript.andM;You can add PostScript to a LaserJet in three different ways.andP;  Physically, byplugging in a cartridge or by adding an expansion board to your computer andconnecting it to the LaserJet vi a cable; or,lastly, leave the printeruntouched and print PostScript files using software that translatesPostScript into the LaserJet's native language.andP;  The LaserJet Series II, IID,III, and IIID can use all three methods.andP;  The IIP, however, can't use anexpansion board.andP;  All three methods work with any application that has aPostScript driver.andM;CARTRIDGESandM;Plug-in cartridges are by far the simplest alternative.andP;  They let you tellyour applications you have a PostScript printer, and print without any fuss.andO;Cartridges are relatively cheap, but you may need to add 1MB or 2MB of RAM tothe printer's memfory before use.andM;If you want Adobe PostScript rather than a clone, the $695 Hewlett-PackardLaserJet PostScript Cartridge is the only way to add it to a LaserJet IIP,IID, III, or IIID; the $495 Adobe PostScript Cartridge is the best way to addit to a Series II.andP;  All current cartridges, whether they use Adobe or aclone, can print Adobe's Type 1 soft fonts, although with differing levels ofquality.andM;The controller in the LaserJet Series II is designed differently from thecontrollers in later printers like the IID, IIP, and III.andP;  So any PostScriptcartridge that works in the later printers won't work in the Series II, andvice versa.andP;  Most cartridge vendors sell two different models, one for theLaserJet Series II and some compatibles, one for later HP printers.andP;  HP sellsan Adobe-licensed cartridge for the later HP printers only, and Adobe sellsits own cartridge speciafically for the Series II.andM;For the fastest and highest-quality output you can get from a cartridge, plugHewlett-Packard's unit into a LaserJet III or IIID.andP;  HP uses Adobe TypeManager font-rendering technology for exceptionally fast and sharp text atsmall sizes, and the Resolution Enhancement technology built into the III andIIID improves the clarity of all text and graphics.andP;  In a LaserJet III, theHP cartridge performed at an impressive 7.4 pages per minute in PC Labs' textspeed test and a reasonable 0.4 graphics pages per minute in the graphicsspeed test.andP;  You get similar output, without the extra clarity of ResolutionEnhancement, when you plug the cartridge into a LaserJet IIIP or IID, or whenyou use Adobe's PostScript cartridge into a Series II.andM;The Adobe cartridge for the Series II prints text at 7 ppm and graphics at0.4 gppm, and includes software to create screen fonts in Windows andVentura.andP;  Adobe has also released two $395 PostScript font cartridges for useonly with the LaserJet Series II/Adobe PostScript cartridge combination.andM;Pacific Data's $495 PacificPage cartridge runs slower than the HP and Adobemodels but has some typographic advantages.andP;  Its built-in Bitstream fontslook better than Adobe/HP versions in all except small sizes, where Adobe andHP create better-spaced, better-shaped type.andP;  The PhoenixPage interpreter inthe cartridge prints Type 1 soft fonts less smoothly than Adobe or HP, but,unlike other PostScript cartridges and software, can also print special softfonts created by Bitstream's Fontware.andP;  In PC Labs' tests PacificPage printedtext at 3.7 ppm and, apparently because of a compatibility problem, failed toprint the graphics test at all.andP;  With other mainstream applications it printsat about two-thirds the speed of the HP model.andM;Two other cartridges, PCPI's $349 ImageScript and Computer Peripherals' $495JetPage, are lesser performers.andP;  Their built-in fonts are crude URW designs,and when they print Adobe Type 1 soft fonts, the output is unacceptably thickand rough-edged.andP;  The ImageScript adds 12 extra built-in fonts to thestandard PostScript 35.andP;  Both cartridges printed text at 2.6 ppm and graphicsat 0.1 gppm in PC Labs' tests.andP;  The vendors won't name the clone interpreterbuilt into these cartridges, but their output is strikingly similar to whatyou get with the Freedom of Press software interpreter.andM;SOFTWAREandM;Four packages let you print PostScript files from any application withoutadding hardware to your printer, although all produce better results if youadd RAM to your computer.andP;  If you have enough extended memory, two of thesepackages, UltraScript PC and PreScript, will load as TSRs, and let you printdirectly from your applications.andP;  These packages also let you print to a fileand then send the file to the printer in a separate operation.andP;  The other twopackages, Freedom of Press and GoScriptPlus, only let you print in a separateoperation after printing to a file.andM;QMS' UltraScript PC ($195 with 25 fonts, $445 for the UltraScriptPlus versionwith 47) produces the finest output of the packages reviewed.andP;  It comes withexcellent fonts, and you cant get more from QMS, although Type 1 fonts aren'tsupported.andP;  As with all these packages, the speed of your computer, not ofyour printer, has the most effect on the print speed, so PC Labs' speed testswon't indicate the performance speed of your machine.andP;  If you installUltraScript PC on a 33-MHz 80386 machine, it prints at about the same speedas the HP cartridge; slower machines lag behind.andM;Pan Overseas Computer's PreScript ($395 with 50 fonts, $195 with 28) includesa nifty Windows preview mode that shows what will print before you see it onthe page, but that's its major advantage.andP;  Although its print speed iscomparable to UltraScript's it comes with notably clunky fonts, and it alsodoesn't support the Type 1 format.andM;Custom Applications' $495 Freedom of Press handles Type 1 fonts, although theoutput from these fonts is thicker and coarser than it should be, and the 35fonts supplied by URW have little appeal.andP;  Freedom of Press installs easily,and runs from convenient batch files, but its processing speed is about halfthe speed of its rivals.andM;LaserGo's $99 GoScriptSelect is by far the least expensive route to LaserJetPostScript.andP;  It prints at a slightly faster speed than UltraScript, but likeFreedom of Press, uses crude URW fonts.andP;  It's convenient to use, but you'llhave to write batch files to make it as handy as Freedom of Press.andM;ADD-IN BOARDSandM;With the advent of PostScript cartridges, most PostScript add-in boards areobsolte.andP;  The 300-dot-per-inch models tend to be expensive, complicated toinstall, take up a slot in your CPU, and make you load software--and slowlyat that--before you can use them.andP;  (For a survey of these boards, see&quot;Post-Purchase PostScript,&quot; April 11, 1989.)andP;  The older 300-dpi boards can'tmatch the output from the latest cartridges, although a new 300-dpi model,the $1,995 Q-Script from Bell andamp; Howard Quintar (Torrance, California, (213)320-5700), uses the excellent PhoenixPage interpreter.andM;Yet unlike cartridges and software, some newer add-in boards can extend theresolution of the 300-dpi LaserJet to as much as 600 dpi.andP;  When Pc Magazinereviewed these high-resolution boards (see &quot;High-Resolution Printer Boards,&quot;April 24, 1990), the best was the $1,195 LaserPort PS 600 from DP-Tek(Wichita, Kansas, (800) 727-3130), which uses UltraScript software to printat a full 600 dpi.andM;Whichever method you decide on, it's time to get PostScript for yourLaserJet.andP;  A great printer deserves nothing less.andM;A non-PostScript P.S.: If you're looking for ways to enhance the typographyor gray-scale output of your LaserJet, you'll find some still-useful tips in&quot;How to Get the Most Out of Your Laser Printer&quot; (November 14, 1989).andP;  Sincethat issue appeared, HP and Pacific Data Products have released scalable fontcartridges for use with the PCL 5 in the LaserJet III.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
