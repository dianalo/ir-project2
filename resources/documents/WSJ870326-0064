The report, which was required by the anti-apartheid act passed last year over President Reagan's veto, is expected to say that the Israeli government condones the practice, according to administration officials. It also will state that arms are shipped to Pretoria from other nations -- possibly including Britain, France, West Germany and Switzerland -- despite efforts by those governments to block the sales, these officials said.    Although the report's findings about Israel have been expected, Jerusalem's supporters see them as another embarrassing disclosure that could worsen already strained ties between the U.S. and Israel. Already, many U.S. supporters of Israel have been shocked and angered by the recent promotions of two Israeli officials who were involved with Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. analyst convicted of spying for Israel, and by Jerusalem's role as an intermediary in supplying U.S. arms to Iran.    Some supporters of Israel are concerned that these events, combined with general U.S. budget austerity, could result in a move to make Jerusalem share in an overall reduction of U.S. foreign aid. Last year, when Israel and certain other major allies were exempted from such reductions, Jerusalem received $1.8 billion in U.S. military aid and $1.2 billion in economic assistance.    The anti-apartheid bill says the report should be used by Congress to consider ending military aid to nations that violate the U.N. embargo, but a complete halt in military assistance to Israel is unlikely.    The report could embarrass many liberal Democrats who led a fight in Congress to impose economic sanctions against South Africa but also are staunch supporters of Israel. Privately, many of these legislators have been urging Israel to begin breaking ties with Pretoria's white minority government, according to an aide to one important Democratic lawmaker.    Last week, partially in response to this pressure, Israel announced that it won't sign any new military sales contracts with South Africa and that it will limit other bilateral links.    U.S. lawmakers who are sympathetic to Israel are expected to react to the report by publicly praising Israel for its recent steps. However, these legislators are worried about the details that might be included in the report. Also, since military contracts between Jerusalem and Pretoria are secret and it isn't known whether the pacts contain renewal clauses, it will be difficult to monitor Israeli compliance.    Some officials estimate that such contracts earn Israeli companies several hundred million dollars annually. Typically, arms are provided through cooperative ventures and the transfer of Israeli military technology to South Africa, rather than direct weapons sales, experts say. For example, Uzi submachine guns and Galil rifles are made in South Africa under arrangements with Israeli firms.    Israel once had warm relations with many black African states. However, in 1973, about two dozen of these nations, reacting to the Yom Kippur War and the new clout of Arab oil wealth, severed relations with Israel. Shortly thereafter, Israel began to build relations with South Africa, which has a sizable Jewish population.    The administration is expected to send Congress a two-page unclassified version of its report and a longer, classified one, by April 1. </TEXT></DOC>
