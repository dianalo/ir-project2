Since 1987 silver prices have declined almost 35% and gold has slumped more than 20%.    But some investors see currently low prices as an opportunity to buy. Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Inc. in New York, is one who now looks favorably on the metals for his clients. But he isn't suggesting people just buy gold or silver and hope for the best. He recommends a low-risk strategy involving coins.    Coin investments come in two types: Numismatic coins depend on their condition and rarity for most of their value, and bullion coins derive almost all their worth from their precious-metal content. Periodically, however, when interest in precious metals picks up, bullion coins will sell at a substantial premium to their precious-metal content. In July and August 1985, for example, the premium increased to more than $1 an ounce, about 17%, over the price of silver for immediate delivery, the so-called spot price. It is during such times that investors playing the coin strategy take profits.    Currently, bullion coins sell close to the value of their metal content, which is why Mr. Gordon says now is the time to initiate the strategy.    The coins recommended for this strategy are bags of U.S. silver coins minted before 1965 that are 90% silver by weight. Most coin dealers sell these bags, each of which contains $1,000 face value of coins and about 715 ounces of silver if melted down. Currently, these coins are selling at a very small premium to the spot price of silver.    In buying such bags an investor risks the difference between the value of the silver in the bag (currently about $3,750) and the $1,000 face value of the coins. Mr. Gordon suggests that investors hedge this risk by selling an appropriate number of silver futures contracts to protect themselves against falling prices. Futures contracts are obligations to buy (for those who purchase) or deliver (for those who sell) a specified quantity of a commodity at the agreed-upon price by a certain date. Most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due.    In a normal market for a non-agricultural commodity that isn't in short supply, the price of each futures contract rises with the number of months remaining until the contract expires. Thus, for example, while the price of silver for September delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange closed yesterday at $5.095, the price was $5.22 for December, a 2.5% premium, and $5.335 for next March, a 4.7% premium.    As the nearby table shows, no matter how silver's price changes, a gross profit will be realized equal to the difference between the cost of the coins and the price for which the futures contract was sold.    In the real world, however, these transactions cost money to carry out. The largest cost is the difference between the price at which the bags of coins can be bought and the price at which they can be sold -- the bid-ask spread. This spread, like much else in the coin market, is negotiable. Several dealers said that if an investor wanted only one bag -- that is, 715 ounces of silver -- the spread would be about 5.4% currently. But for seven bags, which is almost exactly 5,000 ounces of silver, a bid-ask spread of 3% could be negotiated.    In addition to paying for the coins, an investor would have to put up good faith money, called initial margin, of at least $2,500 for each 5,000-ounce silver contract sold on the Comex. A commission of about $35 would also have to be paid for discount brokers to handle the futures trade.    There might also be shipping costs associated with delivery of the coins, or storage costs if an investor decides to leave the coins with the dealer from which they were bought. Mr. Gordon prefers to take delivery of them to eliminate any problems that might arise from the dealer going bankrupt.    Neither Mr. Gordon nor anyone else knows when, or if, silver coin prices will move once again to a premium over their melt value. If the futures contract sold to hedge the coins expires before the premium fattens, that contract will have to be closed out -- with an offsetting purchase -- and another, more distant contract sold in its place. This practice, called &quot;rolling forward&quot; the short position in futures, requires payment of another commission.    &quot;If silver were to make (an upward) move of a couple of dollars (an ounce), I could see the premium for these coins increasing to 10% or 15% over melt value,&quot; says Luis Vigdor, executive vice president of MTB Banking Corp. of New York. He calls silver coins a &quot;sleeper&quot; investment for that reason.    When it's time to collect profits, the investor buys back the futures contract sold to hedge the coins, and sells the coins to a dealer. The coins can't be delivered against the futures contract.    Mr. Gordon says the gross return on this strategy exceeds the rate on Treasury bills while investors wait for the premium to reappear. Once it does, as the accompanying table shows, the returns can be very attractive. The strategy can be carried out with gold coins as well, but it will cost more because the value of a 100-ounce gold contract is about $37,000. Bruce Kaplan, president of Kaplan andamp; Co., a West Coast precious-metals analysis firm, suggests that the strategy could be used successfully with uncirculated George V sovereign coins minted between 1911 and 1932. He says that because these are semi-numismatic coins they are likely to develop a larger premium more quickly than the bags of U.S. silver coins. But he adds: &quot;The bags (of silver coins) are super liquid&quot; -- that is, investors can sell them easily at most dealers. &quot;They are recognized everywhere.&quot;    Jerome Lederman, president of Mocatta Corp. in New York, says that investors who own silver bars might want to swap them for silver coins. Coins can move to a premium over their silver value, he notes, but bars don't.    ---@ Speculating in Silver at Low Risk    The risk of owning silver can be minimized by buying bags of U.S. silver coins and simultaneously selling a futures contract. Each bag contains 715 ounces of silver. When the futures contract expires, its price will be equivalent to the spot price of silver. The capital required to do the trade is the cost of the bags of silver coins plus $2,500 in good-faith money to secure the futures contract. @When an ounce of silver $4.50 $5.00 $5.50 $6.00 @ Sells @Buy 7 bags of coins at @$5.24 an ounce = $26, 226 @Profit (loss) on coins @alone when they sell at no @premium to spot price of @silver .....................(3,704) (1,201) 1,301 3,804 @Profit (loss) on coins @alone when they sell for @15% above spot price of @silver .....................
