RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN><TEXT>   When answering machines request messages for people she phones, Chicago artist Rebecca Wolfran often barks in response. That way, &quot;I feel like I'm more on its level,&quot; she says.    Donna Gaines, a Brooklyn, N.Y., doctoral student, is a confirmed &quot;screener.&quot; She listens as her machine answers and then decides whether the caller is worth a chat. &quot;The machine is about power and politics,&quot; she says.    Country-and-western singer John Schneider has cast the gadget as a dark symbol of alienation. His song &quot;At the Sound of the Tone&quot; tells of a man striving for career success and inattentive to his wife. He calls her one day from the office and gets the machine. &quot;I'm sorry I can't take your call, 'cause I'm packing up to go away,&quot; says her recorded message. &quot;. . . So at the sound of the tone, you're on your own, goodbye.&quot;    Merely a technological curiosity just a few years ago, answering machines are making a widening mark on American social life. They are bringing many people closer together, albeit in a mechanical fashion that Ms. Wolfran and others find rather &quot;creepy.&quot;    At the same time, answering machines allow friends and acquaintances to avoid direct engagement. Like the Walkman and videocassette player, the phone gadgets contribute to what marketing consultant Faith Popcorn calls &quot;cocooning&quot; -- the attempt by people to wrap themselves in zones of privacy.    The growing use of answering machines is in large part due to falling prices. A basic machine can now be bought for around $50, down from $200 just a few years ago. By the end of 1987, 15% to 20% of homes may have one and perhaps 30% in five years. About half the current buyers are women, and young adults are particularly active purchasers. Naomi Baum, a graduate student in Cambridge, Mass., recalls phoning five friends recently and getting five machines in a row. &quot;I was a little shocked,&quot; she says.    By storing &quot;voice messages,&quot; the machines alter the nature of the telephone, which used to only permit people to chat spontaneously and directly, in real time. Now, the phone is &quot;much more akin to a post office,&quot; says Christopher Jackson, the Yankee Group's consumer communications analyst. Phone conversations, participants note, can now be &quot;discontinuous&quot; or &quot;asynchronous.&quot;    Despite the potentially dark implications, answering machines do provide convenience and happy moments, too. On a trip to Los Angeles, Nancy Kaufman phoned home to New York to her own machine, a sophisticated model that played back her messages. One was from a dear but long-lost former employee who by chance now lived in Los Angeles. &quot;I called her and said, 'I'm here,'&quot; recalls Ms. Kaufman. &quot;Without the machine, I would have missed seeing my friend.&quot;    Users stress the machines' convenience for callers who just want to leave the name of a restaurant, theater or other brief information. Freeman E. Robinson, GTE Corp. communications-products marketer, notes that some of the increasingly versatile machines have a &quot;memo record&quot; feature that allows working couples to use the devices as electronic &quot;home bulletin boards.&quot; A spouse alerted by a flashing light can press a button to retrieve a &quot;memo&quot; from his or her mate.    Even people who initially resisted the machines apparently are becoming more resigned to them. Mr. Robinson and other marketers say consumer studies indicate more people are leaving messages instead of hanging up on machines. Glenn B. Miller Jr., a New Jersey retiree, is one convert. &quot;I was beaten down,&quot; he says. &quot;Answering machines are here to stay.&quot;    Still, the use of the machines by owners to screen calls is disturbing to some. Panasonic Corp., citing consumer studies, says new owners generally begin screening calls within 6 to 12 months.    &quot;Everyone does it; maybe everybody doesn't admit it,&quot; says Debra Pine, New York investment strategist. &quot;My good friends all call and say, 'Debbie, Debbie? Are you there? Will you please pick up?'&quot;    Ms. Gaines, the doctoral student, unabashedly admits to &quot;selectively answering my phone.&quot; In particular, she screens calls from a boring and talkative friend. She says she cares too deeply for him to answer the phone only to say she isn't in the mood to chat. &quot;I don't want to blow him away, so I just put on the machine,&quot; she says. &quot;It sort of buys me time.&quot;    Some callers prefer to reach a machine rather than talking directly with an individual. &quot;It's like leaving a message with someone's secretary at lunch time,&quot; says James Wrigley, a Chicago lawyer.    And leaving a message puts the burden on the absent person. After Ms. Pine leaves a message, &quot;the ball is in their court,&quot; she says. &quot;If they call me back, great. If they don't, it's their loss.&quot;    Many people are beginning to suspect that they have been screened -- and resent it. Mr. Wrigley, a screener himself, complains: &quot;I don't like the idea that I'm babbling in someone's machine, and they are sitting there thinking they don't have to pick up or that I'm not interesting enough to them.&quot;    But screening is applauded by Judith Martin, etiquette authority and author of the &quot;Miss Manners&quot; syndicated column. &quot;The expectation that people should be on call all the time to everyone is ridiculous,&quot; she says. &quot;The answering machine is a wonderful way . . . of regulating this.&quot;    Stanley Aronowitz, a sociologist and author of a book on the social impact of science and technology, says screeners aren't simply seeking privacy. &quot;Urban life has become dangerous for a lot of people,&quot; says the New York University professor. &quot;They feel psychologically that they are being protected from that jungle by the answering machine.&quot;    Reaching a machine, however, can still be a haunting experience for some people. Felipe Prestamo, a New York lawyer, recalls calling a woman to ask for a date. Her machine answered, her taped greeting rattled off and then came the beep. &quot;It was time for me to perform,&quot; he says. &quot;Times like that you don't want people to replay what came out of your mouth.&quot;    In an attempt to take the &quot;machineness&quot; out of answering machines, some researchers are developing or refining &quot;messaging systems&quot; that, essentially, chat with callers.    One such approach, called &quot;Phone Slave,&quot; was developed by Christopher Schmandt, principal researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory. The computerized system answers a call, identifies itself as its owner's phone and then asks, &quot;Who is calling?&quot; It records the answer and then, hearing the caller's pause, asks, &quot;What is this call in reference to?&quot; It later asks, &quot;At what number can you be reached?&quot;    Mr. Schmandt says the system also might incorporate an ability to recognize voices so that the owner can leave customized messages for a frequent caller whose voice is recognized.    Active Voice Inc. already has begun incorporating the technology into products being marketed to businesses. &quot;It is more of a real personal interaction,&quot; maintains Robert L. Richmond, president. &quot;If you hit people quickly with very human questions, they get caught up in the interaction.&quot;    Such developments are no consolation, however, for Glynn Babakian, whose plain old answering machine once recorded one of those computer-generated voices that phones around dinner time with marketing pitches. &quot;That was the ultimate in impersonality,&quot; he says.    But there may be a remedy for that, too. Mr. Freeman of GTE says he has heard of a new Japanese-made machine that can record a sales pitch, then dial up the computer and spit back the message. &quot;We will let the machines fight it out, while we go on with our lives,&quot; Mr. Robinson says. </TEXT></DOC>
