Claude Foisy, the government-appointed conciliator, said Canada Post Corp., which operates the nation's mail service, may award franchises on some operations to private business. Canada Post's demand, which is part of current contract negotiations, is opposed by the union. Canada Post is government-owned.    The union, representing 23,000 postal clerks and mail sorters, may legally strike at 12:01 a.m. EDT next Wednesday. The previous collective agreement expired Dec. 31. The union staged a 42-day strike six years ago.    Negotiations, which were broken off during the conciliation period, resumed yesterday in Ottawa.    A strike by the inside postal workers would be the second disruption of Canadian mail service in three months. Last June, a union representing 20,000 letter carriers launched rotating strikes that disrupted postal service for three weeks, before a contract settlement was reached with Canada Post in July.    Canada Post, which has promised to keep the mail moving in the event of a new strike, has advertised in major Canadian newspapers for temporary workers, and is accepting job applications, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
