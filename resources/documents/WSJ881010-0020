The one-month rise of 0.11 percentage point carried fixed-rate mortgages to their highest level since January 1988, the Bank Board said. Adjustable-rate mortgages, meanwhile, climbed 0.17 point to 9.21% in early September.    &quot;The recent upward movement in mortgage rates has generally paralleled increases in rates on other long-term securities,&quot; James Barth, the agency's chief economist, said. </TEXT></DOC>
