Juan Ponce Enrile today calledfor the two top defense officials to resign over the escape of theleader of the bloody August coup attempt.   Enrile said Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos and armed forcesChief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa showed ``negligence andineptness'' in allowing the escape of former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan. Honasan fled a military prison boat Saturdaywith 14 guards.   At a breakfast forum today, Enrile said he had not shelteredHonasan at his beach house. Honasan served as military securitychief when Enrile was defense minister. Enrile was fired from thatpost in November 1986.   Honasan, leader of the Aug. 28 failed coup against PresidentCorazon Aquino, escaped from the ship where he had been held sincehis capture in December. The August coup attempt left 53 peopledead and hundreds wounded.   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said today anationwide search had turned up no significant leads on Honasan'swhereabouts.   But Florendo said three soldiers missing since Monday from anair force detention center had surrendered and were in custody. Allfour had been jailed in connection with coup attempts.   Florendo said Capt. Fernando Logro, Capt. Jesus Sampol, and Sgt.Dante Anggulo gave up to military authorities, who found them attheir homes in three provinces south of Manila.   The spokesman said a fourth soldier, Lt. Belarmino Munar,remained missing. A private radio station, DZRH, quoted air forceauthorities as saying Munar had fled to Los Angeles with his wifeon March 21, the day he escaped.   Enrile also renewed charges today that government troops raidedhis beach house near Manila in search of Honasan. The military,however, has denied it conducted a raid.   ``If it is proven that I had something to do with the escape ofHonasan and ... that I know where he is, I will resign,'' Enrilesaid. ``But they, de Villa and Ramos, should also resign fornegligence and ineptness.''   Enrile urged journalists to ignore a government ban oninterviews with Honasan. He offered his services as lawyer tojournalists who might be prosecuted for violating the ban.   Meanwhile, Honasan's wife Jane sent Mrs. Aquino a letter todayasking for the creation of an independent, civilian body toinvestigate Honasan and others involved in the attempted coup.   Mrs. Honasan accused the government of prejudging her husband'scase. Mrs. Aquino and Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez havedescribed the escape as an ``admission of guilt'' and calledHonasan ``an enemy of the state.''   Honasan's wife described the escape as ``a suddendisappearance'' and added, ``as a wife and mother, I fear for hishealth and safety.''   Enrile and Ramos led the military revolt that helped oustFerdinand Marcos and bring Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986.Enrile later broke with Mrs. Aquino.</TEXT></DOC>
