A leveraged buy-out is a purchase financed largely by debt; the borrowings are ultimately repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group, which holds an approximate 10.6% stake, said it also discussed with the Portec representatives the sale of marginal divisions or subsidiaries, and reducing Portec's debt.    The group said it told Portec it had been contacted by third parties who are interested in acquiring the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company -- &quot;possibly on a hostile basis.&quot;    The group said Portec agreed to contact it about these matters, but no response had yet been received.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Portec shares closed at $7, up $1.375.    A spokesman for Portec, which makes products for the railroad, construction equipment and materials-handling industries, refused comment about the meeting of the group and company representatives. He said he hadn't seen the SEC filing.    As previously reported, Portec's board approved a restructuring plan that will include the sale of assets, and result in an approximate $18.5 million loss for 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
