In the first appellate court ruling on one of the biggestlegal questions stemming from the Sandamp;L cleanup, the appealscourt in Cincinnati said that Franklin Federal Savings Bank,Morristown, Tenn., may have had a contract allowing looseraccounting rules, but that congressional intent in the Sandamp;Llaw appeared to supersede the contract.</LP><TEXT>   The court said that Congress apparently wanted to cause afederal takeover of such thrifts through the Sandamp;L cleanup law.The court left open, however, the possibility that thegovernment could have to compensate the owners &quot;for acontractual property interest&quot; if it seizes the thrift.   Dozens of thrifts were acquired in the 1980s ingovernment-assisted deals when the Sandamp;L insurance fund wasrunning short of cash. Rather than compensate buyers withcash to take over the sick thrifts, the government allowedthem to operate under lenient accounting rules. But the 1989Sandamp;L cleanup law requires that thrifts strictly adhere tohigher capital standards. Lower courts have ruled for andagainst the government in several similar cases, the Officeof Thrift Supervision said.</TEXT></DOC>
