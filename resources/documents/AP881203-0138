In a report to Congress on Friday, the president said Sovietproposals to convert the disputed Krasnoyarsk installation into aninternational space research facility ``would not correct'' itsviolation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.   ``We cannot conclude new strategic arms control agreement whilethis violation remains uncorrected,'' Reagan said.   The proposed new treaty would reduce U.S. and Soviet arsenals oflong-range nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 percent to50 percent. Negotiations in Geneva were adjourned last month withthe two sides agreeing to resume them in early 1989.   The report also accused the Soviets of violating the 1972 ABMtreaty by moving radar and electronics equipment to Gomel, about 350miles southeast of Moscow. And Reagan said the Soviets violated theBiological and Toxic Weapons Convention of 1972 by maintaining ``anactive offensive biological warfare program and capability.''   Other ``probable'' violations of test ban and chemical weaponsagreements were alleged in the report, an unclassified version ofwhich was made public by the White House.   Reagan informed Congress he had reserved the right to take``appropriate and proportionate responses'' to Krasnoyarsk, whichthe report said violates the ABM treaty's ban on trying to set up anationwide anti-missile defense.   But he stopped short of declaring Krasnoyarsk a ``materialbreach'' of the treaty. Such a declaration would be a first steptoward possible U.S. abrogation of the treaty, considered a landmarkin nuclear arms control.   Some of Reagan's advisers had recommended he take that step.   Reagan did not tell Congress in the classified report whatmeasures the United States may take in response to Krasnoyarsk. Inthe past, however, U.S. officials said retaining two or threenuclear Trident submarines that were due to be dismantled was apossible option.   However, the president cautioned that ``in order to broaden thebasis for cooperation between our two countries, the Soviets mustcorrect their violations and noncompliance activities with respectto the ABM treaty and other arms control agreements.''   On the other hand, Reagan said, the Soviets had resolved ``to oursatisfaction'' U.S. questions about their compliance with the treatyto abolish intermediate-range ballistic missiles. That agreement wassigned a year ago.   These included transporting missile parts to and from repairshops and moving missiles outside designated zones, a U.S. officialwho demanded anonymity told reporters at the State Department.   Lt. Gen. Colin D. Powell, the president's national securityadviser, said Reagan was not expected to make ``a major issue'' ofU.S. complaints of Soviet treaty violations in his meeting nextWednesday with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</TEXT></DOC>
