The Dallas-based company also reported Wednesday in documentsfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it maydefault on about $33 million in long-term debts, a move which couldprompt creditors to demand immediate repayment.   ``These factors, among others, indicate that the corporation maybe unable to continue in its present form,'' First RepublicBanksaid in a draft of its annual report to shareholders filed with theSEC. Shareholders have not yet received the report.   Meanwhile, two class action suits have been filed by investorsagainst the company and seven of its top executives in federaldistrict court in Dallas.   First RepublicBank, Texas' largest bank holding company and the13th-largest in the nation, said it expects a ``significant loss''during the first quarter of 1988. Company insiders expect the lossto exceed $500 million.   The loss was caused by major deposit outflows, increases infunding costs and in problem loans, especially in real estate.   The company received a $1 billion bailout from the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. on March 17.   In giving the aid, the FDIC said no protection was offered forFirst RepublicBank's creditors and shareholders. At the same time,the company suspended dividend payments to holders of preferredshares.   The two class action suits accuse First RepublicBank ofmisleading investors about the company's financial health.   The investors allege misrepresentation and fraud in the sale ofsecurities issued before RepublicBank Corp. acquired InterFirstCorp. last June.   In the first suit, New York investor Martin Theodores claimsthat he and other investors saw the value of their FirstRepublicBank securities plummet after the company's bailoutrequest. He claims that investors weren't adequately informed aboutFirst RepublicBank's condition and the possibility that the companywould seek federal assistance.   First RepublicBank spokesman Joe Bowles declined comment on thelitigation.   In documents filed with the SEC, First RepublicBank said it maydefault on about $33 million in long-term debt during the firsthalf of the year.   If that happens and creditors demand immediate repayment, thecompany said, ``the holders of as much as approximately half of theconsolidated long-term debt of First Republic may have the right toaccelerate the due date of their debt.''</TEXT></DOC>
