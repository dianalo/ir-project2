Kenyon here rejecteda county plan to redraw supervisoral district lines that hehad earlier found to violate the constitutional rights of thearea's large Hispanic population.   Judge Kenyon said the plan, supported by three of thecounty's five supervisors, was a &quot;nonsensical distortion&quot; ofexisting district lines and &quot;not a good-faith effort&quot; tocomply with his earlier order.</LP><TEXT>   After announcing his decision in open court, Judge Kenyontook a short break and then began hearing alternativeproposals from the Justice Department, the American CivilLiberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense andEducational Fund.   &quot;His {ultimate} decision could be one of our plans, or onehe develops himself,&quot; said Ramona Ripston, executive directorof the ACLU of Southern California. She expects him to adopta plan as soon as tomorrow.   &quot;We are only a few months away from having results fromthe 1990 census,&quot; said a spokesman for Supervisor MichaelAntonovich, who favored the county plan. &quot;The redistrictingshould be done next year with accurate figures rather thanwith 1986 {population} projections.&quot;   Ms. Ripston countered that the county's &quot;intentionaldiscrimination&quot; has already gone on much too long. &quot;No woman,black, or Hispanic has been elected to the board&quot; in thiscentury, she said.   In June, Judge Kenyon found that the Board of Supervisorsillegally drew boundaries in 1981 to separate the county'sHispanic community into three separate districts, thusdiluting Hispanic voting strength and maintaining anall-white governing board. He ordered the county to draw up aredistricting plan within 20 days. Supervisor Antonovich saidthe county would appeal Judge Kenyon's finding.</TEXT></DOC>
