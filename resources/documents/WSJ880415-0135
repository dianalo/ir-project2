The editorial suggested that although the committee was not &quot;willing to enforce its own standards&quot; in those cases, it has now chosen to do so in the matter of Rep. Biaggi since it will &quot;occasionally sacrifice a weak and unpopular Member to appease the ethicists.&quot;    Against this backdrop of curious reasoning, the Journal indicated that the committee's recommendation to expel Rep. Biaggi from the House &quot;undermines the democratic process. Congress doesn't set the conditions of its own membership -- each serves at the pleasure of the voters. . . . The job of removing someone from an elected office ought to reside . . . with the voters.&quot; The editorial opined that the committee (i.e., Congress) simply has a responsibility to &quot;alert voters that a Member has violated their trust&quot; and that &quot;if voters disagree with the actions of a Member they can vote him or her out of office or, in extreme cases, petition Congress for removal.&quot;    Putting aside, for a moment, the fact that the editorial adopted a philosophical/legal position at odds with the express language of the Constitution, it nevertheless remains that, even when the committee &quot;alerts voters that a Member has violated&quot; some standard of conduct, it nonetheless is to be criticized for doing so -- a &quot;Catch-22&quot; situation. Specifically, in each of the cases cited, the committee made available its findings for public scrutiny, thus enabling voters to make informed decisions on whether to return the individuals to office. (Notably, however, the editorial stated that if transgressions of the type found were to occur in the executive branch, the individuals would have been &quot;dismissed or fined.&quot;) It would thus appear that the Journal is more concerned with the imposition of punishment and its dissatisfaction with the committee's disposition of those cases than with the fact that the committee did indeed take steps to &quot;alert voters&quot; about the actions of the members involved.    As for the concept that the power of removal ought solely to rest with the electorate, it need only be stated that the Constitution (Article I, Section 5, clause 2) expressly authorizes each chamber of Congress to remove a representative or senator by a two-thirds vote. Not only does the law of the state of New York not allow for Rep. Biaggi's constituency to submit a &quot;petition&quot; of the type suggested by the editorial, but the courts have consistently viewed such actions as unconstitutional with respect to members of Congress.    Under our system of government, there are two, and only two, ways to effect an involuntary removal from Congress -- either by the failure of the electorate to return the members to Congress or, in serious matters, by either chamber in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution -- the Journal's views on the proper operation of the &quot;democratic process&quot; notwithstanding. That the committee has made such a recommendation concerning Rep. Biaggi (with a full reporting of all relevant facts) is a matter that should be judged solely on the merits of the issues there involved, and not viewed as one involving the &quot;sacrifice&quot; of a member of Congress to placate the so-called &quot;ethicists.&quot;    Rep.
