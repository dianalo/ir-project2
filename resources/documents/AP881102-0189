(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The latest bidder for PTL says it's``absolutely necessary'' to return deposed evangelist Jim Bakker tohead the bankrupt ministry.   Bakker responded Wednesday that he was ``thrilled at thethought.''   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds is scheduled to choose abuyer for PTL's assets Nov. 16 from four bids ranging from $113million to $120 million for the Heritage USA complex, its 2,200acres and the PTL television network.   A group of ministers and businessmen calling themselves ``LexaltUniversity'' offered $116 million for PTL last week. A spokesman forthe group said Tuesday that they want Bakker at the helm at HeritageUSA.   Of the three previous bidders, one was recommended to Reynolds byPTL Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton. In October, he recommended thejudge accept the $115 million offer from Stephen Mernick of Toronto.After that, another Canadian, Vancouver's Peter Thomas of SamothCapital Corp., resubmitted a bid of $113 million directly to thecourt.   A bid of $120 million by a Christian business association called``Holy Celebration'' was made Oct. 26. Its two trustees are HerbertT. Nelson, a lawyer of Greenbelt, Md., and Sandi Kalez of Seattle.   ``It's absolutely necessary,'' to give the ministry back toBakker, said the Rev. Edward J. Brown of Atlanta, who was acting for``Lexalt University.''   ``If Jim Bakker is not at the helm in the future, sooner orlater, Heritage USA would fall apart,'' Brown said Tuesday.   ``I am thrilled at the thought of returning to television withthe people we love,'' Bakker said Wednesday. ``We're looking forwardto returning Heritage USA to the partners and lifetime members whobuilt it.''   Brown offered $116 million in his bid in U.S. Bankruptcy Court inColumbia. But ``Lexalt University does not really exist,'' saidBrown, an interdenominational minister and financial consultant.   He said Lexalt University and The Covenant Group are names forthe ``facilitators,'' the financial backers who will ``bring thefunds.''   Lexalt backers are ``ministers who are teachers. There will be anopportunity to teach'' at Heritage USA if it's sold to Lexalt, hesaid.   The Covenant Group describes itself as ``Christian businessmenand associates of men all over the country, in and out of the UnitedStates.''   Brown said he has been a minister 17 years, but has been in atraveling ministry since he resigned from his congregation inRedding, Calif., in 1984. He had been an Assemblies of God minister,he said.   Bakker left the ministry amid a sex and money scandal in March1987. Three months later, PTL filed for protection from itscreditors in bankruptcy court.</TEXT></DOC>
