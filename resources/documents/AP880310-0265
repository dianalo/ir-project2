On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for Aprildelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,settled at $15.49 per barrel on Wednesday, up 4 cents fromTuesday's close.   Refined products traded on the exchange were mixed.   Wholesale heating oil slipped .46 cent to 43.03 cents a gallon.Some analysts attributed the decline in heating oil to milderweather, which reduces demand.   But an expected increase in demand for gasoline was credited fora 0.29 cent rise, to 44.00 cents, in the April contract forwholesale unleaded gas. Analysts said distributors have beencarrying low inventories, and demand is expected to pick up withthe imminent arrival of the spring and summer driving seasons.   Crude oil trading was stalled by conflicting reports about SaudiArabia's support for a meeting of the OPEC pricing committee, saidJohn Azarow, senior trader for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Some members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries have called for a meeting of the committee because theprice of OPEC oil has slipped to between $13 and $14 a barrel. Attheir last meeting in December, OPEC oil ministers reaffirmed theirintention to maintain prices at $18 a barrel.   Prices on world markets have fallen because of moderate demandfor oil, price discounting by OPEC members and an increase inoutput by non-OPEC producers.</TEXT></DOC>
