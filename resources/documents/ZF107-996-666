 I, too, have been contemplating both ofthese directions.andP;  I felt that especially this year, which marks the end of adecade, most writers would succumb to the urge to write one or more of thesepieces.andP;  I decided two things: First it is safer to review the past than toforecast the future, and second, reviewing the past is boring both to me andto the readers who will be overwhelmed by &quot;The year in review&quot; items adnauseam for the next two months.andM;Therefore, I decided to combine a look back with a look forward with theunderstanding that the end of 1989 has exactly no significance in thedevelopment of technology nor of the development of product which comescloser to solving a user's problems.andP;  Neither will December, 1989, be the endor finish of any truly great things accomplished by the industry, nor willJanuary be the start of any great and wonderful things to help us move intothe next decade of computing.andP;  Instead, each month that passes brings usnearer to the goal that we all have, to USE computers not to fight with themto get things done.andM;Topics such as &quot;Computing for the 90's&quot; and &quot;The year of the LAN&quot; leave mecold.andP;  Computing for the 90's, for example, will be a continuation of&quot;computing in the 80's&quot;.andP;  We made some real strides: hardware technologyoutpaced software development, more people bought computers, more people gotfrustrated with computers, and more people read about all of the &quot;ease ofuse&quot; stuff that is supposed to be happening to enable mere mortals to beproductive.andM;On the positive side, we have begun to move toward a hardware platform whichmay permit the software industry to catch up somewhat in the 90's (at leastin the Intel World).andP;  However, we also have developed platforms where it iseasier to design and build multiple processor equipment than ever before.andP;  Asa result, we might not slow down enough for the software developers to catchup.andP;  One can only hope, however, that the standardization on the Intel 386chip and above will certainly help.andP;  It is clear that we have moved, duringthe past two years or so, into an arena where the 386 will become the lowestcommon denominator in most corporate computing environments.andP;  These machinesprovide us with enough power, speed, and memory addressing to be real &quot;safe&quot;platforms from which to proceed in our development of truly functionalcomputer systems.andM;Further, with the strides which have been made in the area of datatranslation and ease of conversion, it is no longer really important if thereis a mixture of machines in use in a company.andP;  Apple has done well in thepast few years capitalizing on this fact and there is no reason why thingswill be different in the years ahead.andM;However, before software, there must be operating systems; systems which letthe hardware be controlled by the application that an end-user wants to use.andO;1990 will be a continuation of consolidation attempts in the softwareoperating systems world.andP;  Microsoft and IBM have pledged that OS/2 will bethe platform for the 90's, but, just in case, Microsoft is moving full speedahead with Windows.andP;  DOS, of course, installed on some 40 million computersnow, will not die and go away.andP;  Products like Quarterdeck's DESQView andMicrosoft's Windows will help DOS users cope with the real world issues oftrying to get as much computing power as possible out of 8086 and 80286systems while the &quot;real&quot; computerists are leaving them behind for the worldof the 386 and 486.andM;The Macintosh will also get a new operating system in the next few months inthe form of System 7.0 which, unlike the previous upgrades, is a true andcomplete rewrite of the operating system, filling in many of the operationalareas not addressed in the original system nor in any of the ensuingreleases.andM;Unix is getting a new face almost every week: XWindows, Steve Job's own &quot;lookand feel&quot;, and more.andP;  H-P has a new user interface which runs on its ownplatform and is really spiffy.andP;  IBM has decided that an operating system overtop of an operating system works well and so has given us OfficeVision.andP;  EvenWang has entered the fray with Free Style, a very nice user interface thatcontinues to hype the myth that there really are Wang users still out in thereal world.andM;One would hope that Unix and its many variations and windowing environmentswould settle down to a point where corporate adoptors feel comfortable enoughto implement it in those environments where it makes sense.andM;Anyway, the point is that the 80's certainly were years when the usersstarted to take control of what products the vendors offer.andP;  They were theyears when companies who previously never listened to their customers, now donot make a move without them.andP;  And they were the years when the entire worldfound out that Apple has been right all along, the graphical user interfaceis the way to go.andM;So, as we enter the 1990's, every vendor in the industry is tripping overhimself to provide the &quot;best&quot;, the most &quot;consistent&quot;, the &quot;easiest&quot;, and the&quot;fastest&quot; user interface for the end-user.andP;  It is as if each truly believesthat whoever controls the software for the user's Mouse will control theworld.andM;But, before you enter the decade of the 90's, before you step into thefuture, vendors of the world stand back for a moment and listen to what youhave all been saying to us.andP;  Stand back and remember the very first time youever came face-to-face with a CRT and a keyboard.andP;  Remember the first timeyou ever looked at a screen and only saw a little spec of light called acursor on the screen.andP;  Remember too, how you felt when the first &quot;fatalerror&quot; message flashed across your screen.andM;Remember also, that you have promised us, the end-users, that you willprovide us with a consistent user interface, that all of the printercontrols, video drivers, and memory management functions will be part of theoperating system and that we will be able to install them only once and neverhave to worry about them again.andP;  Nor will we have to be concerned aboutinterfacing new applications written to run under your operating system tothe outside world.andP;  Remember too, that this promise you made is not just tothe end-users, but also to the software authors who will, you say, be able toconcentrate on writing code for truly great applications without having tospend time coding menus, windows, printer and video drivers.andP;  You havepromised us all that you would provide this user interface and promote &quot;easeof use&quot; computing.andM;A Difficult Year?andM;Vendors complain that this year of 1990 might be a &quot;difficult&quot; year, and thatit might only see 10% growth.andP;  Do you guys realize that 10% growth would bewelcomed in many industries as a salvation, as a boom year?andP;  Yet the reasonthat it might only be a 10% growth year is because you have not yet been ableto put it together so that people willing to become &quot;computer capable&quot;instead of &quot;computer literate&quot; will buy your systems.andP;  Please do not feelthat you have provided that level of access yet, even on a Macintosh, or aNeXT system, for potential buyers.andM;There is still too much to learn, too many different ways of installing andconfiguring a new application, and still too much learning time.andP;  I hearagain and again from users who want their computers to be a tool for them andnot their vocation, that installing, learning, and becoming proficient withyet another application is far more trouble than it is sometimes worth.andM;Vendors, what you have been saying to us, the users of your equipment, isthis: We, the vendors, will provide you, the users, with truly great productswhich will permit you to do truly great things, without having to be trulygreat yourself.andM;OK, vendors we are ready for you to deliver on your promises.andP;  We are readynot to have to battle with our computers and our software in order to get thejob done.andP;  We are ready for a common user interface across DOS, OS/2, Unix,VM, and every other operating system.andP;  We are ready for truly transparentdata exchange, data distribution which is simple and gets from point a topoint b in the form it is needed.andM;Further, we are ready to have our PC's connected to others, to mini's and tomainframes in a way that makes sense and does not require us to have tobecome a computer whiz to understand it.andP;  We are ready for these new,powerful computer platforms that you want to sell us to take some of theburden of keeping track of where things are and let us get down to work.andP;  Wewant to have all of this data available to us, but we do not want to have tokeep a log book next to our machine to keep track of where it all &quot;lives&quot;.andM;We are ready simply to turn on a machine, sit-down at the keyboard, and getto work.andP;  We are, the non-typists in the group, ready for some really goodalternatives to input devices, and while you are at it, some really greatoutput devices.andM;We sit here poised and ready to be more productive than ever before with allof these marvelous tools you have promised us.andP;  We are ready to take thesetools and utilize them for our tasks.andP;  We are ready for you to make lifeeasier for us, not harder.andM;You made some progress in the 1980's and you will make more in the 90's I amsure.andP;  Sometimes it also seems slow and tortuous, and sometimes it seems asif you have gotten off the track and have to stumble and fall before you cango on in the right direction.andP;  Sometimes you seem to take steps which are waytoo big and which cannot be followed by the rest of us quickly enough.andM;This is also a very young industry.andP;  Computers have been around for all offour decades.andP;  Microcomputers are celebrating their first full decade inexistence, and yet we are all anxious to get on with it, to get to where itis that we want to go, to get on with it, to realize our dreams and ourgoals.andP;  Of course, along the way we have learned more about what is possibleand so have modified our desires, our wants and our needs.andP;  It is trulydifficult for a computer user who has never been networked to comprehend whatis required of him or her once they are connected, yet once that happens itbecomes very clear what needs to be accomplished next.andM;However, it might be good for each of use to realize that the computerindustry and the users who follow it, are never going to reach the &quot;end&quot; oftheir search for the best.andP;  We are not like a house which is being builtboard by board and nail by nail.andP;  There will never be a time when a carpenterdrives in the final nail, turns around, and with pride in his or her voicesays: &quot;There, it is finished!&quot;andM;What we are all about and what we are into will never be finished.andP;  It willnever be perfect, nor will ever be every thing that everyone wants.andP;  That iswhy we are what we are.andP;  We all have different visions and dreams.andM;More than four years ago I wrote about a local area network I wanted.andP;  It wascontrolled by a huge server which was, in turn, connected to the rest of the&quot;big&quot; computers in use.andP;  All data would be available on this network and mostimportantly, each user would get to choose his own interface.andM;Some might opt for a Macintosh, some for OS/2, some more for Windows, somefor plain old DOS, some for Unix, and others for the more familiar 3270 textbased interface that we have all come to love and hate.andM;It now appears as if we are moving in a direction where we will be able tohave our own special user interface but it will have to be graphical innature.andP;  Maybe there is nothing wrong with pushing us all in this direction,but maybe, just maybe, some of us will remain more productive doing thingsthe &quot;old way&quot;.andM;Where will the 1990's take us?andP;  Beyond where we are now, for sure, butexactly where is anybody's guess.andP;  Rather than dwell on new technologies Iprefer to view the 90's as a continuation of the trip we started in the 80's.andO;A trip which will take us to a common goal: to use computers to make our jobseasier, to make our companies more profitable, and to permit us to make useof our leisure time for things other than banging on a computer keyboard.andM;In the meantime I would like to extend my best wishes for your happinessduring this holiday season and offer one final wish to all: May the 1990'sbecome known as the decade of world harmony and peace.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
