In Oregon agriculture officials say that one-third of the state's strawberry crop will rot thanks to the new immigration bill. The Beatles may have sung of strawberry fields forever, but this isn't what most people had in mind. Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) got what he wanted. After five years of pushing bills to &quot;do something&quot; about immigration, the aliens are going home.    The bill criminalizes big chunks of the labor market -- almost 10% of the workers in textiles, agriculture and restaurants. A garment-factory owner in Los Angeles reports a loss of one-third of his workers. There aren't enough cherry pickers in California. Washington, D.C., hotels can't find enough kitchen workers.    The bill President Reagan signed last November makes it a crime for employers to hire &quot;illegal aliens,&quot; punishable by fines of up to $10,000 plus six months in jail for each employee. This put the desired fear into employers. Combine the complicated paper work the bill demands with the risk of jail terms, and the sure result was a chaotic reverse exodus of foreign workers.    The law hasn't fully gone into effect yet, but already about two million people are crossing the Rio Grande back to Mexico after being fired north of the border. The employer sanctions were supposed to begin June 1, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service recognized serious problems, such as their failure to get required forms to employers. So the INS decided to postpone enforcement until July 1. Now the Senate wants to put the entire bill on hold until Oct. 1.    Few pieces of legislation have self-destructed this quickly. A large part of the problem is that there just aren't enough &quot;legal&quot; workers willing to take the abandoned jobs. Another is the confusion about what the law requires. Employers must fill out INS I-9 forms to vouch for the citizenship or right to work of all new employees. There are penalties against discriminating against applicants who might look or sound foreign, so employers must get papers to prove the bona fides of all new workers. There is an exception for farm workers who can prove they worked at least 90 days during the year beginning May 1, 1985. But the rotting Oregon strawberries attest to the failure of the INS to reassure employers about this part of the law.    Some of the fired workers are probably eligible for amnesty. Aliens who have lived in the country since Jan. 1, 1982, are entitled to legal status. But at the current rate, it will take until the 2000s before the four million or so eligible aliens apply. Church and civil-liberties groups report great distrust of the government's offer. Amnesty is also an expensive proposition. There are reports of lawyers charging several thousand dollars a person to help a family get amnesty. Aliens tend to avoid contact with the government, including paying taxes. The Internal Revenue Service could assess penalties for nonpayment of taxes, which could present the Catch-22 of denying legal status to aliens on the basis of tax-law violations.    This domestic morass also has become linked to the beginnings of a foreign-policy problem. Democratic governments throughout Central America are pleading with the U.S. to let their people stay. One-fifth of El Salvador's former population now lives in the U.S., most of them illegally. Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras have joined in warnings of huge local unemployment if millions of people return.    The immigration law, which had the backing of President Reagan, is a mammoth interference in the free market. Congress opens the lid to a full Pandora's box of unforeseen problems when it tampers with the laws of supply and demand, which it does routinely. Most of the time Congress yawns when the consequences of its legislated inefficiencies begin to appear. New laws generally result from the legislators' belief that they'll receive credit for addressing various public outcries. The likelihood here is that they'll soon get the blame for a labor mess too large to ignore.    The rallying cry for the immigration bill was that the U.S. was &quot;losing control of its borders.&quot; In fact the people crossing the border came to the U.S. possessing nothing but pro-American dreams, offering their energy and talents in exchange for the opportunity to fulfill those dreams. They took jobs that it is now apparent no one else here wants. Millions of new Americans before them did the same thing, with wondrous results. The immigration law is a &quot;No Vacancy&quot; sign that taints this country's moral landscape. </TEXT></DOC>
