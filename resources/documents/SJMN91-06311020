Morgan andamp; Co. was the first major banking company to announce a primerate cut, effective immediately. It was closely followed by the nation'slargest banking company, Citicorp, as well as BankAmerica Corp., ChaseManhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chemical Banking Corp., andFirst Chicago Corp.;   Other major commercial banks were expected to followthe move.;   Several hours later, the central bank added money reserves to thebanking system in a move seen as lowering the target for the federal fundsrate from 5 percent to 4.75 percent. Unlike the discount rate, the Fed doesnot announce actions involving the funds rate.;   But David Wyss, an economistwith DRI-McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., economic forecasting service, said,&quot;I think the Fed clearly is moving to a 4.75 percent target now that it haslowered the discount rate.&quot;;   The Fed said its discount rate action was takenagainst the background of sluggish growth in the money supply and tight banklending policies, which were restraining economic growth. At the same time,the announcement said inflationary pressures were abating.;   The discountrate is the interest the Fed charges commercial banks for loans. Such a moveusually results in lower interest on other loans, including consumer credit,and thus stimulates spending and economic growth.;   Shortly before the Fedannouncement, President Bush told a news conference that Tuesday's electionresults made clear the economy is a major concern of Americans.;   &quot;There's amessage here for the administration and a message here for the United StatesCongress.&quot; Bush said. &quot;When the economy is slow, people are concerned. They'rehurting out there. They're concerned about their livelihood.&quot;;   The Feddiscount rate vote was 4-1 with Federal Reserve governor Wayne D. Angell, amajor anti-inflation voice on the board, opposing the move. There are twovacancies on the seven-member board.;   In its statement, the Fed said &quot;Thereduction, in part, also realigns the discount rate with other short-termmarket rates.&quot;;   The decline in the discount rate was the fifth since Dec.18, when the rate was lowered to 6.5 percent from 7 percent, and dropped therate to the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1973, when it was raised from 4.5percent to 5 percent.;   Since December, each Fed move cutting the discountrate was accompanied by a drop in the federal funds rate.;   The Fed boardcontrols the discount rate, while the Open Market Committee sets the targetfor the federal funds rate.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911106  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  506  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 6, 199100311020,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
