The Commerce Departmentalready has issued a preliminary finding that dumping of thechemical is occurring.   The question of how China practices trade has taken onincreasing importance lately, as China's trade surplus withthe U.S. threatens to leap beyond that of Germany and Taiwannext year, ranking it only behind Japan. U.S. concerns arethat China is achieving much of its advantage through unfairtrade practices such as dumping, defined as the selling ofgoods in a foreign country at less than fair value.</LP><TEXT>   A U.S. final investigation will consider whether anindustry in the U.S. is materially injured, or is threatenedwith material injury, or whether the establishment of anindustry in the U.S. is materially retarded by foreign-madegoods being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value.   Similar investigations are being conducted concerningpossible dumping of the chemical by Germany and the UnitedKingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
