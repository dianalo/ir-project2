GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The communist leaders of remote Laos areloosening their grip on the country in a local version of theKremlin's sweeping reforms.   Under the banner of the ``New Economic Mechanism,'' ownershipand inheritance of private property have been newly sanctioned, acode encouraging investment from the capitalist world has beenpassed, and plans are under way to cut by one-third a bureaucracythat controlled the lives of Laos' 3.9 million citizens.   Although still a one-party state wary of political dissidentsand run by some of the world's most durable revolutionaries, Laosmay go farther in liberalizing its economy than neighboring Vietnamand a number of other communist countries, according to Westerndiplomats stationed here.   ``People are beginning to smile again,'' said one European whohas known the country for decades.   While state co-operatives do exist, bonuses and other incentiveshave been introduced, and several purportedly socialist enterprisesvisited appeared to have the loosest kind of structure.   ``Go see what we have in the co-operative store, then come backand buy from me,'' said a friendly old woman trying to sellhand-woven cloth to visiting Western journalists.   Although still quiet and slow-paced by most measurements,striking changes are apparent in Vientiane, the capital city of250,000.   The tailors and jewelers along Samsenthai, the city's maincommercial street, are back in business, as are the dance hallswhere women in sarongs and their partners alternate betweentraditional ``ramwong'' music and semi-hard rock.   Unthinkable a few years ago, Laotian women now dance withforeigners at some clubs. Teen-agers wear longish hair and Westernfashions, which in the early days of communist rule was enough tohave them branded as ``decadent hippies'' and sent off tore-education camps.   At the city's sprawling central market, U.S. dollars, Thai bahtand the local kip currency are all legally used to buy Japanesetelevision sets, Thai-made ``designer'' clothes, European liquorand a wide variety of local farm produce. The newly remodeledmarket is on lease for 10 years to Thai businessmen who shareprofits with the government.   Economically booming Thailand next door is the source of mostconsumer goods, which are traded or smuggled across the MekongRiver frontier. Local purchasing power is fueled by some $3 millionto $5 million yearly sent home to relatives by refugees in theUnited States, France and elsewhere.   ``Business is getting better every day,'' said VirachitPhilaphandeth, one of a growing number of enterpreneurs whosemonthly 300,000 kip ($850) in net profit is about 50 times the wageof a middle-ranked government official.   Virachit, whose ventures include a lumber mill, said growingconfidence in the New Economic Mechanism is leading to moredomestic investment and a mini-boom in private home-building, whichis evident in Vientiane and other areas of Laos.   The new policies, the diplomats agree, have been influenced byGeneral Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the SovietUnion, as well as by reforms in neighboring China and Vietnam, andby television programs, avidly watched here, from robustlycapitalist, pro-Western Thailand.   The reforms are also apparent reactions to the period betweenthe communist victory in 1975 and about 1980, when the regimeattempted to collectivize peasants, flirted with inappropriateindustrial projects and attempted lifestyle changes antithetical tothe basic Laotian character and traditions.   The economy stagnated. An estimated 350,000 people, including abulk of Vientiane's skilled middle class, fled the country andadherents of the toppled, U.S.-backed government were sent to harshre-education camps. An insurgency flickered.   Although Laos did not suffer the postwar traumas of itsIndochinese neighbors, Cambodia and Vietnam, neither was thetransition a ``Song and Dance Revolution'' as some observersclaimed.   ``There is no philosophy which must be followed from here toeternity,'' a key economic planner, Somphavanh Inthavong, said inan interview. He explained that slowly evolving reforms wereformally approved at the communist party's Fourth Congress inDecember 1986 and have gained steady momentum over the past year.   Whatever changes the economic loosening may bring to thepolitical arena, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, as thecommunist party is called, currently shows few signs of relaxingits grip on power or dismantling a watchdog apparatus whichpenetrates to the grassroots.   The country's first national elections since 1975 are scheduledfor mid-November following balloting at district levels. Officialssay there will be more candidates than the 79 seats in the SupremePeople's Assembly but all will be screened before being allowed torun.   The major tasks of this and next year will be to finish thedraft of a constitution _ the first under comunist rule _ and tosubstitute a legal system for the decrees under which the countryhas been run since the end of the Indochina war in 1975.   Widely seen as the architect of change is Kaysone Phomvihan, the68-year-old leader who is one of the longest power-holders in thecommunist world. He has headed the party since 1955.   Although long regarded as a conservative, Kaysone has sharplycriticized the system's shortcomings and opened some doors.   Western diplomats say the bulk of re-education camp inmates havebeen released. Laotians are being permitted to visit refugeerelatives abroad and Buddhism appears to be well tolerated.Although entry into Laos is still difficult, more Westernjournalists have been allowed to visit the country in recent months.   Laos is closely bound to Vietnam and the Soviet Union, butUnited Nations statistics show that unlike a few years ago about 60percent of the $100 million that Laos annually receives in economicaid is now coming from the non-communist world, notably Japan,Sweden and Australia.   Souphavanh, the economic planner, said the main socio-economicthrust will be to uplift the more than 3 million poor, subsistancefarmers, including large numbers of ethnic minorities, in therugged countryside.   Few roads penetrate the provinces, electricity is rare anddiseases rampant, with the infant mortality rate at 120 to 130 per1,000 births, among the highest in the world.   Officials indicate that a key measure of the new economicpolicy's success will be its effectiveness in spreading therelative prosperity now being enjoyed in Vientiane and the lowlandsbordering Thailand.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sun June 5</NOTE></DOC>
