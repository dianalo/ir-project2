These requirementsapply to workers employed from October 1, 1988, through September 30, 1992,and were developed with the Department of Agriculture after consultationwith the Department of Justice's Immigration and Naturalization Service(INS) and the Bureau of the Census. Section 210A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended bythe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), requires any employer toreport information about the amount of work performed by a special agriculturalworker employed in seasonal agricultural services. This information issubmitted in certificate form to the Federal Government and to any individual``replenishment agricultural worker.'' In part on the basis of this informationfurnished to the Federal Government, the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculturewill determine the number, if any, of additional replenishment agriculturalworkers to be admitted into the United States. The accuracy, completeness,and timeliness of the employment information reported by employers of specialagricultural workers in seasonal agricultural services will directly affectthe Secretaries' determination of the number of replenishment agriculturalworkers admitted into the country during each year from FY 1990 throughFY 1993. These regulations specify employer reporting requirements and provisionsconcerning the terms of employment of replenishment agricultural workersas prescribed by section 210A of INA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Paula V.

The Wage and Hour Divisionreceived 13 comments from agricultural employers, agricultural associations,advocates for farmworkers, and public interest groups. In response to thecomments, several changes have been made to the proposed rule. The majorityof these changes were clarifying in nature. Supplementary information,including a summary of the final rule, and a compilation of the issuesraised in public comment with accompanying Wage and Hour Division responsefollow.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 20\1/2\ minutes per response for the report to the Federal Governmenton Form ESA-92, one minute per response for the report to replenishmentagricultural workers (optional Form WH-501R), and one hour per year forthe underlying recordkeeping. This burden estimate includes the time forreviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering andmaintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including comments on the ESA-92and optional WH-501R and suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Officeof Information Management, Department of Labor, Room N-1301, 200 ConstitutionAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; and to the Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs, Office of Management 1215-0168, and Budget, Washington,DC 20503. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has cleared the paperwork requirementsof this regulation at andSection;andSection; 502.11, 502.12, and 502.13 andof Forms ESA-92 and WH501-R (optional), under control numbers 1215-0148,1215-0168, and 1215-0169.<T3>Comment: </T3>There were several comments specifically regarding thepaperwork burden. One commenter suggested that the paperwork requirement is ``excessivelyburdensome and costly.'' Another commenter suggested that the amount oftime spent to complete required paperwork is not justified especially whenreporting for workers who sometimes work fewer than 5 days. The third commentersuggested that the recordkeeping requirements are burdensome and have ``lowtime estimates for preparing and submitting the reports'' because of thetime consuming job of reviewing daily records, having to refer to dailyfield records to obtain daily hours worked, and lack of crop and task information.<T3>Response: </T3>The reporting requirements implemented with these regulationsare established by law and apply for all special agricultural workers employedin seasonal agricultural services, even if so employed by any employerfor only one work-day in a quarter. The Department does not have discretionin this regard. Further, the Department continues to be of the view thatthe burden estimate stated above is the best estimate of the <T3>average </T3>burden per response. The estimates for the optional FormWH-501R and the recordkeeping are based on the fact that almost all ofthe information required to be maintained in the employer's records andreported to the workers, including for example, daily hours worked, iscurrently required from the vast majority of agricultural employers employingreportable workers pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), theMigrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act (MSPA), and theIRCA requirements for maintaining Forms I-9. The primary additional burdenis the preparation of the ESA-92 each quarter to be sent to the Government.Based on studies that agricultural employers in California average theequivalent of ten full time employees per employer, and assuming four ofthese employees would be reportable workers, we assume an average of fiveminutes per worker would be spent in preparing each ESA-92. Our view isthat this is a reasonable average estimate since the information can beeasily compiled from the reports (optional Form WH-501R or other form usedby the employer) currently provided to workers under MSPA. Furthermore,a prudent business operator, aware of the reporting requirement, wouldensure the information is easily retrievable at the end of the quarter.<T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter suggests that instead of instituting reportingrequirements, the Department should institute some type of ``statisticalsampling to project accurately the changes in labor demand and supply aspracticed by the national opinion polls.'' The commenter suggested thatthe statistical sampling is less costly and less burdensome than the reportingrequirements as drafted. <T3>Response: </T3>While it may be, as suggested, that sampling would beless costly and less burdensome, there is a statutory requirement for reportingwhich cannot be substituted by sampling. Therefore this change is not made.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two other commenters made reference to a Department ofLabor survey. The survey will use sampling techniques to assist in estimatingthe supply of farm workers for employment in seasonal agricultural services.The commenters expressed concern about the design of the survey and thevalue its results may have in determining the number of replenishment agriculturalworkers to be authorized. <T3>Response: </T3>The survey is an additional source of information whichwill be used by the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculture in determiningwhether there is a shortage of workers for employment in seasonal agriculturalservices. While the Department appreciates the commenters' concerns, thesurvey is not a subject of these regulations. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter suggests that (1) the reporting system alsorequire reporting of specific losses of alien employees to non-agriculturalemployers and (2) an additional system be instituted so that agriculturalemployers could recruit specific alien workers for their agricultural employmentneeds. <T3>Response: </T3>The regulation implements the statutory requirementsto have employers report the number of ``man-days'' (``work-days'' herein)worked by reportable workers in seasonal agricultural services, and itmay not arbitrarily expand or add further burden by requiring additionalreporting for purposes which are not authorized by the Act. Consequently,no related change has been made in the final regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background to the Regulation</ITAG>The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA) was amended by the ImmigrationReform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) to: (1) Control illegal immigrationinto the United States and (2) make limited changes in the system for legalimmigration. In this regard, Section 210 of the INA grants resident alienstatus to special agricultural workers (SAWs) who can demonstrate thatthey performed seasonal agricultural services for at least 90 ``man-days''during the 12-month period ending May 1, 1986.In part on the basis of information regarding work-days of employment (duringeach fiscal year (FY) from FY 1989 to FY 1992) in seasonal agriculturalservices, submitted by employers to the Federal Government pursuant tothis regulation, the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculture shall determinethe number, if any, of additional special agricultural workers, termedreplenishment agricultural workers (RAWs), to be admitted to the UnitedStates (during each fiscal year from FY 1990 to FY 1993) with temporaryresident alien status to perform seasonal agricultural services. The admittanceof replenishment agricultural workers is to meet a shortage of workersemployed in seasonal agricultural services.To make this determination, section 210A(b)(2) of the INA requires an employerof SAWs (including RAWs) employed in seasonal agricultural services toassemble employment information which must be reported to the Federal Governmentduring the period beginning October 1, 1988, through September 30, 1992;essentially the same employment information that must be reported to anyindividual replenishment agricultural worker during the period beginningOctober 1, 1989, through September 30, 1992.Section 210A(f)(4) of the INA provides for assessment of civil money penalties,as provided under Section 503 of the Migrant and Seasonal AgriculturalWorker Protection Act (MSPA), for, among other things, failure to provide,or failure to provide accurately, the information as required by INA section210A(b)(2).<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Final Rule</ITAG>This final rule establishes:(1) Data collection procedures to enable the Federal Government to makedeterminations about the annual number of replenishment agricultural workersto be admitted to the United States and given temporary residency status,from October 1, 1989, to September 30, 1993, to meet a shortage, or replenish,the number of workers employed in seasonal agricultural services; and(2) A method whereby a replenishment agricultural worker (at least thoseadmitted before FY 1993) can assemble some of the information necessaryto establish the work history needed to retain legal temporary residentstatus and avoid deportation, apply and qualify for permanent residentstatus after three years (from being admitted for temporary residency)and, subsequently, to apply for naturalization. The work history neededto retain legal temporary resident status, avoid deportation, and qualifyfor permanent resident alien status is 90 work-days (any day with at leastfour (4) hours worked) a year for three consecutive years after admission,employed in seasonal agricultural services. Accordingly, an employer whohires a replenishment agricultural worker shall report the employment informationspecified by this rule (at section 502.13) to the worker each pay periodwhen seasonal agricultural services are performed, for the period throughSeptember 30, 1992.Although replenishment agricultural workers will need such informationfor three consecutive years after admission to retain temporary residentalien status, avoid deportation, and apply for permanent resident alienstatus (and will need such data for a total of at least five years to applyfor citizenship), the statute only requires such reporting through September30, 1992. Consequently, the statute_while establishing requirements fordemonstrating continued employment in seasonal agricultural services inorder for a replenishment agricultural worker to retain legal temporarystatus and avoid deportation, and apply and qualify for permanent residentalien status (and, eventually, citizenship)_does <T3>not</T3> authorize requiring agricultural employers to provide replenishmentagricultural workers with the required employment documentation, afterFY 1992, to support the entire work history needed to qualify for changein immigration status. For example, the Act requires that RAWs admittedin FY 1992 must be provided with employment reports by their employersfor their work in seasonal agricultural services during FY 1992 but <T3>not</T3> thereafter_despite the statutory requirement that they mustdocument such employment for at least three consecutive years after admissionto retain and eventually change their legal status. There is <T3>no</T3> statutory requirement in <T3>INA</T3> mandating <T3>any</T3> such reporting to RAWs admitted in FY 1993 (although reportingof some employment information is required by employers covered under MSPA).To carry out the statutory requirements, employers are mandated to: (1)Identify each reportable worker employed in seasonal agricultural servicessubject to this regulation, (2) report to the Federal Government the numberof work-days performed <T3>by</T3> any such reportable worker, and (3) report the number of work-daysperformed <T3>to </T3>each reportable worker who is a replenishment agriculturalworker.Under the provisions of section 274A of the INA, an employer may only hirepersons who are eligible to work in the United States. With respect toany person hired after November 6, 1986, every employer must verify theemployee's identity and employment eligibility and complete the INS EmploymentEligibility Verification Form I-9 (see 8 CFR 274a.2).When completing the Form I-9, the employer is able to recognize reportableworkers subject to the provisions of this regulation by the INS Alien RegistrationNumber (``A Number'') provided by the newly hired employee on the INS FormI-9. When completing the top portion of the I-9 Form, a prospective employeewho is not a United States citizen must provide an INS Alien RegistrationNumber in completing part (Part 1) of the I-9 form.Any prospective employee must also provide documentation that establishesidentity and employment eligibility. As long as the documents furnishedby the worker satisfy the requirements of the INS regulations as set forthon the Form I-9, an employer may<T3> not</T3> require any additional or specific documents from the employee(see 8 CFR 274a.2(b)(v)). An employer, therefore, may be unable to determinewhich employees are special agricultural workers based on the document(s)presented to establish identity and employment eligibility.INS has, or will, assign INS Alien Registration Numbers in the A90000000series to all workers whose status has been adjusted under the provisionsof the IRCA amendments to the INA, including special agricultural workers(and replenishment agricultural workers). Therefore these regulations definea reportable worker as any worker employed in seasonal agricultural serviceswhose INS Alien Registration Number is within the A90000000 series.An employer must report to the Federal Government as prescribed hereinon the employment of any and all resident aliens identified with an INSAlien Registration Number in the A90000000 series who are employed in seasonalagricultural services for even one work day (any day in which at leastfour (4) hours of work are performed) in any quarter. Such reports mustbe submitted for each quarter in which any reportable worker is employedfor at least one work-day in seasonal agricultural services for the periodfrom October 1, 1988, through September 30, 1992. Where employment verificationhas been performed by a State Employment Service, rather than the employer,and results in a referral of a job applicant to an employer, these regulationsrequire the State Employment Service to provide the employee's Alien RegistrationNumber obtained during the verification process on its certification tothe employer. Therefore, the employer will be able to identify the reportableworker under this rule. (An employer may not be able to identify a specialagricultural worker continuously employed since prior to November 6, 1986,since employers are not required to complete I-9s or have State EmploymentService certificates on such ``grandfathered'' employees. These ``grandfathered''employees are not considered as ``reportable workers'' under this regulation(unless I-9s have been completed for any such employee and the employeeotherwise meets the definition of a ``reportable worker'').)As set forth above, the INA as amended by IRCA requires that employersverify the identity and employment eligibility of all employees hired afterNovember 6, 1986. However, the Act also provides that no penalties willbe assessed prior to December 1, 1988, against employers with respect toemployees in seasonal agricultural services. A statement of mutual understandingbetween representatives of agricultural growers and the INS provides thatthe INS will not initiate enforcement penalties against agricultural employersfor failing to fulfill the I-9 requirements with respect to employees inseasonal agricultural services prior to December 1, 1988, and INS and therepresentatives of the growers will encourage the growers to complete theI-9 form for all employees hired after November 6, 1986. After December1, 1988, agricultural employers will be liable for penalties for failingto conduct such verification and to complete I-9s on any workers then intheir employment (except ``grandfathered'' employees) for whom there isno completed I-9.These regulations require employers to report quarterly to the FederalGovernment on all workers employed in seasonal agricultural services foreven one work-day after October 1, 1988, who are identified as reportableworkers through the I-9 or State Employment Service certification process(i.e., who have Alien Registration Numbers in the A90000000 series). Forthe first quarter for which reports are due, from October 1 through December31, 1988, an employer must therefore report the number of work-days performedin seasonal agricultural services in the months of October, November, andDecember with respect to all reportable workers for whom I-9s are completed(or State Employment Service certificates have been received), whetherthe employment eligibility verification process is completed before orafter December 1, 1988, and whether the workers are employed before orafter December 1, 1988.Employers must report each quarter the work-days in seasonal agriculturalservices of every reportable worker identified. During the first quarterfor which reports are due, reportable workers identified during Octoberand November must be reported on (as well as workers reported on for workin December). If some or any reportable workers are not identified untilI-9s are completed (before or) on December 1, 1988, their total work-daysduring the entire quarter (i.e., including any work performed previouslyin October and November) must be reported. However, during this first quarterand only during this first quarter (October 1-December 31, 1988), employersmay not be able to report on that subgroup of seasonal agricultural workers,if any, for whom I-9s were not completed in October/November_in relianceon the statement of mutual understanding. This subgroup of employees wouldbe limited to those workers employed in seasonal agricultural servicesfor whom no I-9 was completed prior to December 1, 1988,<T3> and</T3> who were no longer employed on and after December 1, 1988.The reports furnished to the Federal Government under these regulationsare an essential ingredient of the statutory process for determining theannual numerical limit on the number of replenishment agricultural workers,if any, to be admitted into the United States from FY 1990 through FY 1993.Complete, accurate, and timely reporting of the information required bythis regulation is essential to an accurate determination of the numberof work-days of employment in seasonal agricultural services by specialagricultural workers, and is directly linked to the determination of thenumber of replenishment agricultural workers to be admitted to the UnitedStates.After the reports are received by the Federal Government, the INS willdetermine which of the resident alien workers in the A90000000 series onwhom reports were submitted were admitted under the special agriculturalworker program. The Bureau of the Census will then use this data to determinethe number of special agricultural workers employed in seasonal agriculturalservices (based on work in seasonal agricultural services performed byspecial agricultural workers who worked an <T3>aggregate </T3>15 work-days per year in seasonal agricultural servicesfor any number of employers), and the average number of work-days in seasonalagricultural services performed by such special agricultural workers. Inthis regard, every employer of a reportable worker or workers is mandatedto report as prescribed herein even one work-day (a day with four hoursor more of work) in seasonal agricultural services by any reportable workersin any calendar quarter.The determinations of the Bureau of the Census will then be used, alongwith other information, by the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculture todetermine the annual number, if any, of replenishment agricultural workersto be admitted to the United States with temporary resident status to performseasonal agricultural services in FY 1990 through FY 1993. Another rulewill be promulgated to explain this procedure.Included within the A90000000 series are all of the replenishment agriculturalworkers (who will be specifically identified with an INS Alien RegistrationNumber series to be incorporated in these regulations when announced byINS at a later date). As in the case of the other special agriculturalworkers, an employer must report to the Federal Government on the employmentof any replenishment agricultural worker who worked at least one work-dayin seasonal agricultural services. However, in addition, an employer mustreport <T3>to </T3>each such replenishment worker, with each wage payment, informationconcerning the number of work-days the individual was employed in seasonalagricultural services during the pay period. Since MSPA currently requiresthe provision of employment information to migrant and seasonal agriculturalworkers each pay day, optional form WH-501 used for such reports is beingmodified (WH-501R) to include the work-day information required by theseregulations. Employers have the option, however, of providing this sameinformation (see andSection; 502.13) to the workers in any manner, such ason the pay stub furnished workers with their wages.Because this employment information will be needed by replenishment workersto retain their temporary legal status and apply and qualify for permanentresidency and citizenship, these regulations require that underlying payrolldata for such replenishment workers be retained for at least five years.This will assist most replenishment agricultural workers in establishingtheir employment history, at least in part, and will assist INS in verifyingwork histories provided by such workers. Other records and reports requiredby these regulations need to be retained for at least three years.The responsible person to report to the replenishment agricultural workerand to the Federal Government is the employer (or the employer's designatedagent). An employer may designate or delegate the tasks of recordkeepingand reporting, but retains ultimate responsibility and liability for failure(s)to comply with the requirements of INA or these regulations. Further, FormsESA-92 must be certified/signed by the employer. In this regard, the Departmenthas adopted the definitions of ``employee,'' ``employer,'' ``employment,''and ``independent contractor'' promulgated by the INS in its regulationsat 8 CFR 274a.1. Those regulations define employer to include a contractoras opposed to a person using contract labor. As a general matter, therefore,it is possible that a farm labor contractor is responsible for reporting,rather than the grower who uses the services of a farm labor contractor.Pursuant to section 210A(f) (1), (2), and (3) of the INA, additional provisionsof the regulations require that employers of a replenishment agriculturalworker must: (1) Provide the same transportation arrangements to otherworkers as are provided to any replenishment agricultural worker and (2)not discriminate against any replenishment agricultural worker. The Actat section 210A(f) further requires that employers who would otherwisebe exempt from MSPA (29 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3>) pursuant to section 4(a) (1) or (2) of MSPA, not knowinglyprovide false or misleading information to a replenishment agriculturalworker concerning the terms, conditions, or existence of agricultural employment.In addition, pursuant to the definition of ``seasonal agricultural services''in section 210(h) of the INA, the Department has incorporated the definitionsof ``field work,'' ``horticultural specialties,'' ``fruits,'' ``vegetables,''and ``other perishable commodities'' promulgated by the Department of Agriculturein regulations, 7 CFR Part 1d. The Department of Agriculture has recentlyamended those regulations (53 FR 31630, August 19, 1988) and their newdefinitions are incorporated herein. (Any further amendments to their definitionswill be automatically incorporated in these regulations.) In addition,pursuant to the order issued in <T3>National Cotton Council of America v. Lyng</T3>, Civil No. CA-5-87-0200(N.D. Tex., February 8, 1988) ``cotton'' has been declared to be a fruitand therefore it is not listed as an example of a commodity excluded fromthe definition of ``other perishable commodities.'' Because applicationof the provisions of sections 210 and 210A to hay, sod, and sugarcane isin litigation, these regulations also include field work on those cropsfor purposes of these regulations only. The requirement of reporting onany work in these crops does not constitute evidence that they are eligiblecrops for purposes of the special agricultural worker program. Rather,they are included to enable the Federal Government and the individual replenishmentworkers to obtain data on work in these crops which will be needed if itis ultimately determined that they are eligible crops. Once the issuesare finally resolved in the courts, these regulations will be amended accordingly.Finally, pursuant to INA section 210A(f), the regulations contain enforcementprocedures, including procedures for assessing civil money penalties forviolations of section 210A, in accordance with MSPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Further Comment and Response</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>There are several commenters who addressed the subjectof educating the public about this regulation. One commenter suggestedthat there be provided a ``well-planned and successfully-conducted'' educationprogram directed to agricultural employers about the special agriculturalworker/replenishment agricultural worker program through ``a publicitycampaign emphasizing the importance of the program, direct mailings, andposting notices in the county offices of the Department of Agriculture'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.'' Another commentersuggested there be ``immediate educational effort by the Department ofLabor, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Department of Agricultureand other agencies'' to inform agricultural employers about this regulation.The third commenter suggested that DOL emphasize ``the need to ensure voluntaryand widespread compliance by the employer community with the reportingrequirements'' thereby ``alleviating legitimate concerns over the burdensomenature of the requirements * * *.''<T3>Response: </T3>An extensive program of public information and educationis planned. Copies of the regulation, the Wage Statement (optional FormWH-501R), the Work-Day Report (ESA-92) and a simplified information pamphletoutlining these requirements are to be:(1) Available at all:(a) Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division Area Offices nationwide;(b) Offices of Agriculture's county extension service nationwide;(c) County offices of the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Stabilizationand Conservation Service;(d) INS (including Border Patrol sector headquarter) offices nationwide.(2) Mailed to all:(a) Registered Farm Labor Contractors;(b) Identified interest groups and representational organizations.Additionally, press releases will be issued regarding the responsibilitiesset forth in these regulations. Lastly, the Wage and Hour Division, andespecially its Farm Labor Specialists, in the course of contacting employers,conducting investigations and providing technical assistance, will distributewritten materials and inform employers about these regulations. The informationprovided will explain not only the recordkeeping and reporting requirements,but also the purpose they serve for employers who may have shortages ofagricultural labor and need replenishment agricultural workers, and forthe replenishment agricultural workers seeking to maintain legal statusand obtain permanent resident status and citizenship.Educational efforts and compliance requirements will progressively phasein starting October 1, 1988, when the law requires recordkeeping and reportingonly on the employment of special agricultural workers. Further informationwill be provided in conjunction with the admission of replenishment agriculturalworkers beginning October 1, 1989. Starting with the second year (FY 1990),recordkeeping and reporting requirements are applicable not only for specialagricultural workers but also for replenishment agricultural workers.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the Department of Agriculturebe the agency that collects the employment information rather than theDepartment of Labor as the proposed regulations were read to suggest.<T3>Response: </T3>The Committee for Employment Information on SpecialAgricultural Workers (see andSection; 502.12) is an inter-agency committee.This Committee, as opposed to the Department of Labor, will collect theemployment information furnished to the Federal Government and act as acoordinator for all Federal Government agencies connected with this legislation_theDepartments of Labor and Agriculture, in consultation with INS and theBureau of Census. A technical revision to this regulation will be issuedin the near future to provide the full mailing address of the Committee;in addition, the ESA-92 form, when printed and distributed, will containthe full mailing address of the Committee.<T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter suggested that agricultural employers shouldbe represented on the Commission on Agricultural Workers established underIRCA. Furthermore, it suggested that this Commission should be consulted``as to the need for additional workers.''<T3>Response</T3>: The establishment and functioning of the Commissionon Agricultural Workers is not within the purview of this regulation andis not addressed here.<T3>Comment</T3>: Two commenters suggest that the regulation be more preciseon the enforcement procedure which will apply to an employer who must reportSAW employment data to the Federal Government from October 1, 1988, throughDecember 1, 1988, but does not complete I-9s during October or Novemberbecause of IRCA's deferment of sanctions. (Note: A statement of mutualunderstanding between representatives of agricultural growers and the INSprovides that the INS will not initiate enforcement penalties against agriculturalemployers for failing to fulfill the I-9 requirements with respect to employeesin seasonal agricultural services prior to December 1, 1988. INS and thegrower representatives, however, were to encourage all of the growers tocomplete the I-9 form for all employees hired after November 6, 1986.)<T3>Response</T3>: As explained above, the INA as amended by IRCA requiresthat employers verify the identify and employment eligibility of all employeeshired after November 6, 1986. The Act also provides that no penalties willbe assessed prior to December 1, 1988, against employers on the basis ofany violation alleged with respect to employees in seasonal agriculturalservices. However, as required by section 210A of the Act, and as reflectedin these regulations, there is no stated exception to an employer's obligationof reporting accurately on the employment of special agricultural workersfrom October 1, 1988, through December 1, 1988. Our understanding is thatmany employers in agriculture are currently completing the I-9 forms asthey are encouraged to do by INS and the agricultural associations. Westrongly encourage employers to continue to complete and retain the I-9sbecause of their importance to the entire process of determining the numberof replenishment agricultural workers who may be admitted to the UnitedStates starting in FY 1990.In any event, by December 1, 1988, an employer must undertake the employmenteligibility verification (Form I-9) process for <T3>all </T3>seasonal agricultural workers then employed (if hired afterNovember 6, 1986). As indicated above, to address the apparent conflictbetween the October 1 effective date for recordkeeping and reporting underthese regulations, and the December 1 effective date of sanctions for failureto complete the employment eligibility verification (I-9) process, thefollowing further clarifies the requirements of these regulations: <T3>any </T3>and all employment in seasonal agricultural services performedby a reportable worker identified through the employment eligibility verificationprocess_whether completed on or before December 1, 1988, and whether thework was performed in October, November, or December 1988_<T3>must </T3>be reported. Employers may be unable to report during thisfirst quarter <T3>only</T3> on workers engaged in seasonal agricultural services duringOctober or November who left employment before December 1 and for whomno I-9 was completed.<T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter believes there will be employees whoseemployment will not be verified because they were hired prior to November6, 1986, being ``grandfathered'' and potentially reportable workers. Theysuggest that the regulations should provide an alternative method of identifyingthese employees other than the I-9 method, which is not applicable.<T3>Response</T3>: The Department is aware that the employer is not requiredto fulfill the I-9 obligation for those employees continuously employedsince prior to November 6, 1986. However, it is our view that the numberof special agricultural workers employed at the present time by the sameemployer who employed them prior to November 6, 1986, is very likely tobe so insignificant as to not justify initiating an alternative reportingmethod, especially considering the absence of a viable alternative methodology.Section 502.2(f)(2) Definition of Employer<T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters favored this section. There were twocommenters who made suggestions for change. One commenter suggested thatthe definition of employer, including joint employment, should derive fromFLSA and MSPA, which would greatly improve compliance by ``holding farmemployers and labor contractors jointly responsible for reporting.'' Anothercommenter suggested that ``the employer of the worker'' be the responsibleparty to do the reporting since INS regulations specifically ``allows foran agent of the employer to prepare and retain the I-9 document on behalfof the employer.''<T3>Response: </T3>These regulations are based upon the requirements ofthe INA as amended by IRCA and are dependent upon completion of the employmenteligibility verification (I-9) process. Therefore, it was deemed most appropriateto follow the definition of employer developed by INS for its I-9 enforcementprocess. No change is made.There are instances where an agent prepares and retains I-9 documentation.In such circumstances, the regulation holds the employer responsible forthe recordkeeping and reporting requirements under this rule. An employermay, as its option, delegate the task of keeping the required records orpreparing and submitting the required reports (provided that they are signedby the employer) to the government and to the replenishment workers, andmay delegate such tasks whether or not it has also delegated the I-9 responsibility.However, the employer is responsible for the acts of its agent and willbe held responsible for compliance with these regulations. Section 502.10(a)has been modified, with the addition of a new paragraph (3), to clarifythis issue.Section 502.2(n) Definition of Reportable Worker<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that this definition state specificallythat a reportable worker is one who works ``for four or more hours on oneor more days during the reporting period.''<T3>Response: </T3>Since a reportable worker is identified at the timeof completion of the employment eligibility verification process, it isnot appropriate to change the regulation. However, the regulation makesclear that reports must only be filed regarding reportable workers whowork at least one-day in any quarter in seasonal agricultural services.Section 502.2(o) Definition of Seasonable Agricultural Services<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the definition of ``seasonalagricultural services'' reflect the inclusion of packinghouse work. Thecomment indicated that this work ``was included as eligible by Immigrationand Naturalization Service (INS) wires and memorandums'' and is a partof the definition of seasonal agricultural services.<T3>Response: </T3>The definition of seasonal agricultural services asdefined in Department of Agriculture regulations is incorporated as requiredby section 210A(h) of the INA. Their regulations are referenced in andSection;502.2(o) of these regulations. It is our view that these regulations arenot the appropriate place to interpret the meaning of the Department ofAgriculture's definitions. However, it should be noted that since publicationof the proposed regulation, the Department of Agriculture has promulgateda new definition of ``vegetable'' (53 FR 31630, August 19, 1988). Thatnew language has been incorporated herein.Section 502.2(s) Definition of Work-day<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the statutory term of ``man-day''be used instead of ``work-day.'' Another commenter asked that the ruleclearly point out that a ``work-day'' of four (or more) hours is statutory.<T3>Response: </T3>As stated in the regulation, in order to avoid confusionwith the other programs enforced by the Department of Labor, the term ``work-day''was adopted in lieu of the statutory term ``man-day.'' The ``man-day''definition in andSection; 502.2(k) is changed to read that ``man-day'' forpurposes of this regulation means ``work-day.'' The standard (of four ormore hours) is indentical to that in the statute and only the terminologyis different. No further change is made.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested referencing the applicabilityof Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) hours worked principles in this regulation.<T3>Response: </T3>The definition of work-day in andSection; 502.2(s) ischanged to reflect the requirement that hours of work for such purposebe determined as established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C.201-219) and under the principles found in 29 CFR Part 785.Section 502.4 Investigation authority of Secretary<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the Department's investigationauthority should parallel INS's investigation authority by requiring athree day notice prior to inspection. The comment further suggests thatinterviewing of employees during the enforcement process be eliminated.<T3>Response: </T3>All representatives of the Secretary of Labor are trainedto coordinate and organize their visits in a manner that takes into considerationthe mission of the government in carrying out the public interest, theCongressional mandate, as well as the employer's business activities. Generallythese officials will be conducting investigations in agriculture concurrentlyunder the provisions of the FLSA, MSPA and/or the H-2A programs, as wellas this regulation. Prior notification is not required under these Acts(the H-2A program is another program established by the 1986 IRCA amendmentsto the INA). The Department of Labor's inspection of I-9s, which conformsto the INS three day notice provision, is a record inspection program andtherefore involves a different technique than can be applied to investigationprograms.The interviewing of employees is an integral part of verifying that anemployer has performed the reporting requirements accurately, and ensuringthat an employer has complied with the employee protection provisions ofsection 210A. Asking questions of both the employer and the employee, whilereviewing available records, is a fundamental part of the investigationprocedure. In addition, interviewing workers cannot be eliminated sincetheir rights, including their right to adjustment of status, are involved.No change is made.Section 502.5 Prohibition on interference with Department of Labor officials<T3>Comment:</T3> There were two comments on this section. One commentersuggested there is no statutory authority in the INA to authorize a prohibitionagainst interference with Department of Labor officials and that the criminalauthority of 18 U.S.C. 111 and 18 U.S.C. 1114 did not apply. It was furthersuggested that this reference is ``unconstitutionally vague and/or overboard,and does not follow the standard of the underlying statute.'' Another commentersuggested that the word ``interfere'' be defined and that no violationbe cited ``against an individual who believes he/she is exercising his/herconstitutional rights.'' <T3>Response:</T3> In order to effectuate the Act and clarify the applicationof the Federal criminal statutes, changes are made to the regulation. Thesechanges clarify that potential criminal penalties may be pursued only underthe terms of 18 U.S.C. 111 and 18 U.S.C.1114, and that civil penaltiesmay be assessed under this regulation. In addition, language has been addedto clarify its scope.Section 502.10 As indicated above, a change has been made to add paragraph (a)(3) clarifyingthe responsibilities of employers and their agents.Section 502.11 Recordkeeping <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the regulation be changedso that it is clear that only copies of reporting forms have to be retainedas opposed to retaining the ``actual forms.'' <T3>Response:</T3> Section 502.11(a)(2) provides that only copies of theESA-92s and copies of the reports to the replenishment agricultural workersbe retained. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that recordkeeping requirementsare not required by statute and are ``redundant and unnecessary to auditingor otherwise verifying the accuracy of information submitted by employers.''<T3>Response:</T3> The authority of the Department to review payroll records(and to interview employees) is implicit in the statute and is indispensablein verifying compliance with the reporting requirements and the accuracyof the reports submitted. Most of the records are already required to bemaintained under MSPA and FLSA, as recognized by the commenter, so thereis little additional burden. No change is made in the regulation. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that records should be createdand maintained for five years following the termination of the program,or through FY 1998. Two commenters suggested that replenishment agriculturalworker records should not have to be maintained for five years. <T3>Response:</T3> Replenishment agricultural workers have to establishthat they worked at least 90 ``man-days'' (herein termed ``work-days) inseasonal agricultural services for three consecutive years to retain legaltemporary resident alien status, avoid deportation and qualify for permanentresidency, and for five years to apply for naturalization. Although theworkers are required to be given this information every pay day, retentionof the basic records for five years is an important back-up source to theworker if the documentation is not furnished or if it is stolen or lost.Similarly, the records are an important back-up for INS if the ESA-92sare not received or if there is an error in their tabulation, in orderto help establish the legitimacy of the worker's application and detectfraud. For thses reasons, it is our view that retention of the basic recordscovering replenishment agricultural workers is not an unreasonable burden.On the other hand, because workers can apply for citizenship after fiveyears, and because the statute only requires that the reports be furnishedto the government through FY 1992, we do not believe that we can reasonablyimpose a longer recordkeeping requirement. As discussed at length above, the statute only requires reporting to individualreplenishment agricultural workers and to the Federal Government throughFY 1992. There is no statutory basis for requiring creation of recordsbeyond FY 1992. However, replenishment agricultural workers will need evidenceof the number of work-days in seasonal agricultural services and otheremployment information well beyond October 31, 1992, when the reportingrequirements end. It is imperative that employment records be accurateand maintained to reflect the information necessary to substantiate, ifonly in part, any worker's continuing legal status, and subsequent applicationto change legal residency status and/or to apply for naturalization. Itis in the public interest that basic employment records be maintained forat least five years, and no change is made in this section. However, becauethe information contained in the notice to the workers (optional WH-501R)is contained in the basic records, retention of these forms beyond threeyears was deemed an unnecessary burden. Therefore, andSection; 502.13(e)is changed to read that the employer shall keep a copy of each completedreport to a replenishment agricultural worker for no less than <T3>three</T3> years. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the requirement to listthe employee's permanent address be dropped. This is suggested becauseit may not be provided by the worker and some workers don't have permanentaddresses ``given the transient nature of the farmworker population.''<T3>Response:</T3> Section 502.11(a)(1)(b) is changed so that the permanentaddress is recorded <T3>if any is provided.</T3>Section 502.12 Reporting to the Federal Government <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that employers report to thegovernment the hours and type of work for all agricultural workers in theA90000000 series rather than just those employed in seasonal agriculturalservices. This is ``to avoid problems inherent in such subtle distinctions.''<T3>Response:</T3> The Department believes that ``seasonal agriculturalservices'' is clearly defined in the regulations and in the ESA-92 instructions,and that it is not appropriate to impose any further burden on employers.Furthermore, sorting the workers employed in seasonal agricultural servicesfrom other workers in agricultural employment will pose a considerableburden to the government, which would impede the ability of the Departmentsof Labor and Agriculture to timely determine the shortage number necessaryfor admission of replenishment agricultural workers. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the ESA-92 should includethe Social Security Account Number in addition to the INS ``A number.''<T3>Response:</T3> The Department does not think it is necessary sinceonly the INS ``A number'' reveals the worker's immigration status. No changeis implemented. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that ``certified report'' andthe word ``crop'' be defined. <T3>Response:</T3> A ``certified report'' is one that is signed and certifiedby the employer, who certifies to the truth, accuracy and completenessof the information provided on the ESA-92. ``Crop'' refers to the fruit,vegetable, or other perishable commodity in which field work, as definedby the Department of Agriculture regulation, is performed. We believe thatthese terms are sufficiently clear and that no change is necessary to theregulation.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested that when reporting to the FederalGovernment, the Department accept certified computer-generated lists submittedby the employer to be acceptable in lieu of form ESA-92.<T3>Response: </T3>In order to further facilitate the submission of thereports, the regulations and ESA-92 instructions are changed to acceptcertified computer generated paper listings of employee information, attachedto an otherwise complete ESA-92, in the same form and containing the sameinformation as called for on the ESA-92. The employer reporting to theFederal Government can select one of two reporting means:(a) Complete the form ESA-92 only; <T3>or</T3>(b) Complete the form ESA-92 except for item 6, which contains the name(s)of reportable workers, ``A number(s),'' and work-day information. The employermust attach a computer-generated paper listing with all the informationrequired for item 6 of form ESA-92, furnished in the same format as calledfor on the form ESA-92.The instructions for form EAS-92 have been modified to reflect these changesand a requirement for the employer's signature, not only to the truthfulattestation on the ESA-92 (which must always be submitted), but also onthe attached computer-generated paper listing.<T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter further suggested that the ESA-92 be clarifiedby explaining the calendar period of a fiscal year, specify the quartersin the instructions and give better instruction for completing the sectionabout crop activity if the ``worker did not work in a specific crop activity.''<T3>Response: </T3>The Department believes that the ESA-92 is fully explanatoryin listing the calendar period and quarters, which are also explained inandSection; 502.12 of the regulation. No further instructions are necessary.If the work performed was not in seasonal agricultural services, the employerdoes not have to report the employment (and no entry is made).<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the two week period forfiling form ESA-92 does not allow sufficient time to complete the report.They suggest an allowance of 30 days. Another commenter suggested thatJanuary 16, 1989, was too early for submission of the initial report.<T3>Response: </T3>The information reported to the Government on the ESA-92smust be checked for apparent errors, tabulated, submitted to INS for identificationof the special agricultural workers, and forwarded to the Bureau of theCensus. The Bureau of the Census uses this information to determine thenumber of special agricultural workers who performed seasonal agriculturalservices during the fiscal year, and the average number of work-days ofsuch services performed by such workers. This information in turn mustbe used, with other data, by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor todetermine the shortage number (if any)_the number of replenishment agriculturalworkers who can be admitted in the next fiscal year. In order to timelyperform all of these functions, and considering the importance of a timelydetermination by the Secretaries, we have concluded after consultationwith all of the affected agencies that the time period for submission ofthe ESA-92 reports cannot be lengthened. Furthermore, since a prudent businessoperator will have maintained the required records in an easily accessiblemanner, it is our view that the burden of submitting the information withinthe period designated is not unreasonable. The ESA-92 may be completedand submitted anytime prior to the required submission date (for example,at the end of a season) so long as the report contains <T3>complete </T3>information on the <T3>total </T3>work-days in seasonal agricultural services by special agriculturalworkers during the quarter being reported by the employer and the employeris <T3>certain </T3>that no additional seasonal agricultural services willbe performed. No change is made to the regulation.No comments were received on the Department's proposal to require reportingof reportable workers' work-days in hay, sod, and sugarcane_crops whosestatus is contested in litigation. The requirement to furnish the informationon the ESA-92 has been included in order to assure proper treatment ofwork on these crops when the litigation is concluded. After further considerationit has been determined that the information furnished may be ambiguousif a worker employed in a contested crop was employed in more than onecrop. Therefore, the regulation and the form ESA-92 have been revised torequire that the employer separately list the number of work-days performedin seasonal agricultural services in each of the contested crops, as wellas the number of work-days in all other crops. This will permit more accuratecompilation of the data.Section 502.13. Reporting to the Replenishment Agricultural Worker<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the regulations be changedto require employers to give the replenishment agricultural worker somenotice of the need ``to earn and collect 90 days worth of work documentationduring each year in order to satisfy Immigration and Naturalization Service(INS) that the worker is legally maintaining the temporary status.''<T3>Response: </T3>The Department of Labor recognizes the importance ofinforming and educating replenishment agricultural workers about the employmentprotections afforded them under the law and about their obligations toobtain and retain evidence of their work history in order to retain legaltemporary residency status and establish a claim for change of legal statusand, eventually, naturalization. The Department of Labor and INS will undertakeefforts to ensure that replenishment agricultural workers are fully informedin these matters, both at the time of their admission and during the courseof their employment in the United States. In response to this comment,the (optional) Form WH-501R has been modified to include a notice to theworker-recipients of the information, advising of the vital importanceof retaining the documentation relating to their employment history inseasonal agricultural services. Furthermore, these regulations requirethat employers retain copies of basic employment records relating to replenishmentagricultural workers for no less than five years (as discussed above, andset forth in andSection; 502.11) in order to provide some fall-back for replenishmentagricultural workers who may not receive or somehow lose such employmentdocumentation. However, we believe that it would be impractical to requireemployers to explain to their replenishment agricultural workers what theirobligations are in maintaining legal status and/or in applying for changein legal status.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the requirement to report``crop worked and the tasks performed'' has ``no real purpose for the worker* * * and is an unnecessary reporting requirement.''<T3>Response: </T3>The requirement to list ``crop worked and the tasksperformed'' in reporting to replenishment agricultural workers is essentialto their demonstrating that they have met their employment obligationsin seasonal agricultural services. No change is made.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggest that, to avoid additional paperworkand expense, the regulations should allow using the ESA-92 (or a computer-generatedreport, which contains the same information in the same or similar formatin reporting to replenishment agricultural workers, rather than requirea separate report (i.e., the optional WH-501R, or equivalent).<T3>Response: </T3>Reporting to the replenishment agricultural worker onthe ESA-92 would violate the privacy protections of any other workers whoseemployment information would appear on the same form, and cannot be allowed.Further, due to the transitory nature of the agricultural workforce, thestatutory purpose would not be served unless the replenishment agriculturalworkers receive the information at the time of each wage payment. No changeis made to the regulation. (The use of computer-generated reporting inrelation to the ESA-92 is discussed above under comments on andSection; 502.12.)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that reporting to the replenishmentagricultural worker should be only when the replenishment agriculturalworker requests it and, if not, on no more than a quarterly basis.<T3>Response</T3>: The statute clearly states that the employer reportemployment information to the replenishment agricultural worker. The Departmentbelieves that the law does not permit such reports to be made only whenrequested. Furthermore, it is our view that furnishing the report to theworker each payday is necessary, considering the high mobility and generallytransitory character of the seasonal agricultural workforce, to effectuatethe law's purpose that these workers be provided the information necessaryto retain their legal temporary residency status and obtain permanent residencyand naturalization, at least for the period that the statutes sets forreporting. <T3>Comment</T3>: The commenter further suggested that the reporting tothe replenishment agricultural worker, in addition to that required byMSPA, be only that information specifically required by IRCA (number ofwork-days, crop and task). <T3>Response</T3>: We have concluded that several items of informationlisted in this section of the proposed rule should be dropped from therequired report to replenishment agricultural workers. Three of these items(i.e., employer's telephone number, type of agricultural business, andthe worker's local address) were not included on the proposed (optional)form WH-501R in any case. Another item (the date the report was furnishedto the worker) has also been dropped from andSection; 502.13 and form WH-501R.On the other hand, we continue to believe that the replenishment worker'sINS ``A number'' must be included to allow verification of status as areportable worker. Further, information on the date the worker is paidis necessary to ascertain compliance with the requirement that the reportbe furnished each payday. We point out that the WH-501R itself is an optionalform. The required information (as specified in andSection; 502.13 of theregulation) may be furnished in any written form. <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter suggested that this section be changedto clarify that the report to the replenishment agricultural worker mustbe provided in written form. They further suggest that the form shouldstate on its face that the form is an optional one and not required. <T3>Response</T3>: Section 502.13(a) is changed to read that each replenishmentagricultural worker is to be furnished a ``written'' report. The (optional)form WH-501R has been modified to show that it is an optional form. (Seealso the discussion above in relation to andSection; 502.11 regarding theretention period for these reports.) Section 502.14 Accuracy of information furnished <T3>Comment</T3>: Two commenters suggest that the regulation should beclear that small and family businesses are not required to furnish theinformation required by MSPA section 301. <T3>Response</T3>: The comments are correct that the information whichMSPA requires to be furnished employees does not need to be provided toemployees of those small and family businesses exempt from MSPA. The onlyrequirement imposed by IRCA is that if any such information is provided,an employer not knowingly furnish any false or misleading information.However, employment information is commonly provided to employees, andthe Department encourages employers to provide such information. Sincethe regulation does <T3>not </T3>require employers to furnish employment information (exceptas specified for replenishment agricultural workers), but only requiresthat no employer knowingly furnish false or misleading information, nochange is needed in the regulation. Section 502.15 Discrimination prohibited. <T3>Comment</T3>: There were two comments regarding this section. One commentersuggested that this language adopt the statutory language which incorporatesthe provisions of section 505 of MSPA. <T3>Response</T3>: Section 502.15 is written to incorporate the languageof section 505 of MSPA. Specifically, the incorporation includes the intentthat any worker shall be protected from discrimination because the workerexercised the right to file a complaint, to cause to be instituted a proceeding,to testify or be about to testify in a proceeding, or otherwise exercisedor asserted a right or protection afforded by section 210A of IRCA or theseregulations on behalf of the worker or others. <T3>Comment</T3>: Another commenter suggested that the discrimination protectionsshould be ``changed to allow an employer to terminate'' a replenishmentagricultural worker ``for cause'' with the exception of subsection (a)(1),(2), (3), and (4). <T3>Response</T3>: The regulation sets forth what kinds of activities areprohibited. If the prohibited acts are not performed, then no violationhas occurred. No change is made. Section 502.16 Prohibition on providing false information when reportingto a replenishment agricultural worker or to the Federal Government. <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter suggested that the word ``material'' beadded to this section per the statute, to read as follows: ``Any personor entity who employs * * * shall not furnish a certificate * * * containinga false statement of material fact * * *.''<T3>Response: </T3>Section 502.16 (a) and (b) are changed to include theword ``material.''<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested there is no statutory authorityto impose 18 U.S.C. 1001. <T3>Response: </T3>The criminal authority of 18 U.S.C. 1001 exists independentof IRCA. There is nothing in IRCA which expands or diminishes the alreadyexisting criminal authority. Reference is inserted in these regulationsfor informational purposes only. However, the reference to the criminalauthorities is moved to a new section, 502.26, and has been rewritten forclarification. Section 502.16(c) is deleted. The proposed regulation, inandSection; 502.16(b) erroneously stated that reporting to replenishmentagricultural workers is only for the period through September 30, 1989.This has been corrected to reflect the statutory requirement that reportingcontinue through September 30, 1992. Section 502.17 Equal transportation provision<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested the regulation ``should definein more detail what generally comparable in expense and scope means withrespect to transportation arrangements. For example, what types of transportationare covered and should be equal? Another commenter suggested that thissection is ``broadly subject to interpretation'' and suggested a definitionof their own. The third commenter suggested that the statutory description,``comparable in expense and scope,'' be inserted in the regulation. Itsuggested further that the regulation should be clarified to state thattransportation is not required. <T3>Response: </T3>The Department's intent is to reflect the statutoryprescription that the same transportation offered to a replenishment agriculturalworker must be offered to any worker who is not a replenishment agriculturalworker. One commenter specifically asked if an employer who offers transportationto a replenishment agricultural worker in another country to the work sitemust also offer free transportation to any other agricultural worker inthe United States. As the Department of Labor construes the statute, theanswer is clearly ``yes'' (provided that the transportation is ``comparablein scope and expense''). If any replenishment agricultural worker is providedone-time transportation to a work location, the same transportation (comparablein scope and expense) must be provided to any worker who is not a replenishmentagricultural worker who so desires. Moreover, if daily, local home-to-workand return transportation is offered to any replenishment agriculturalworker, such transportation also must be offered to each worker who isnot a replenishment agricultural worker. Section 502.23 Civil money penalty assessment<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the regulation be changedto reflect that no civil money penalty (CMP) assessment will be made ifan employer fails to report on a worker who fails to voluntarily furnishan INS ``A number'' in the A90000000 series when completing the Form I-9.<T3>Response: </T3>The employer is required to ensure that the I-9 formis properly completed. See <T3>United States </T3>vs. <T3>Mester Manufacturing Company, </T3>Immigration Review Case No. 87100001,Decision of the Administrative Law Judge (June 17, 1988). If a worker identifieshimself or herself as an alien on the I-9 form (in Part 1) and fails toprovide an ``A number'', the employer is held responsible for ensuringthat the alien provides this number. On the other hand, an employer can<T3>not </T3>require presentation of any <T3>specific </T3>document to ascertain or verify the workers' status andmust accept any documentation presented by the worker that establishesidentity and employment eligibility as listed in IRCA and the implementingINS regulations, 8 CFR Part 274a, and on the Form I-9 itself. Therefore,the employer cannot look ``behind'' a worker's statement regarding citizenshipstatus nor require the worker to provide documentation validating an ``Anumber'' provided by the worker on the I-9. Of course, if a worker voluntarilyprovides INS documentation containing their ``A number'' to establish identityand employment eligibility for I-9 purposes, the employer is expected toensure that the ``A number'' provided by the worker in completing Partof the I-9 is correct. An employer who ensures that its I-9 forms are properly completed as describedabove will not be found in violation for failing to report on (or to) aworker who does not accurately identify himself or herself as having an``A number'' in the A90000000 series. The employer is, however, responsibleto have workers who identify themselves as aliens provide their ``A number.''<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that violations for failing to keeprecords andSection; 502.23(b)(6)), failing to provide records to Departmentof Labor officials andSection; 502.23(b)(7)), and interfering with a Departmentof Labor investigation andSection; 502.23(b)(8)) are not subject to any penaltyby statute.<T3>Response: </T3>The Department believes these penalties are necessaryto effectuate the Act and its provisions and are implicit in the Department'senforcement authority under the Act. No change is made. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date_Good Cause </ITAG>The Secretary has determined that good cause exists for making the effectivedate of this rule October 1, 1988, within the meaning of the AdministrativeProcedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d). Since the statue requires that reports be furnished to the government forall reportable special agricultural workers employed during the periodOctober 1, 1988, through September 30, 1992, it is determined that it isnecessary to make the rule effective on October 1, 1988, in order thatemployers be informed of and comply with the recordkeeping necessary tofurnish the report required for the first quarter of FY 1989. The burdenimposed by this recordkeeping is minor since employers currently subjectto the FLSA, MSPA, and IRCA employee verification requirements (section274A) of INA are already required to maintain most of the information requiredby these regulations. The necessity for extensive interagency consultationand coordination prevented issuance of a final rule at an earlier date.However, interested employer and worker groups were consulted prior toissuance of the proposed rule and efforts are being made by the Departmentsof Labor and Agriculture to publicize the regulations prior to their effectivedate. It is in the public interest to have this regulation become effectiveon October 1, 1988, to effectuate the statutory reporting requirement,and to enable the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculture to start collectingthe data needed to determine the shortage number, if any, to permit theentry of replenishment agricultural workers in FY 1990. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291; Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>The Department has determined that this rule is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291. The Department has also determined that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. These conclusions are reached because most of the entitiesaffected are already providing agricultural workers with itemized pay stubsin compliance with the requirements of the Migrant and Seasonal AgriculturalWorker Protection Act (MSPA). The amount of time spent preparing reportsto the Federal Government will not be substantial. Consequently, the Departmentcertifies under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that the rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The Department presents forms in the Appendix which satisfycertain disclosure and recordkeeping aspects of the Act and the regulations.These forms, however, will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Appendix </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Appendix A_Work-Day Report, ESA-92. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Appendix B_Wage Statement, WH-501R (optional). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 502 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural associations, Agriculturalworker, Aliens, Farmers, Farm labor contractor, Immigration, Investigation,Labor, Penalties, Replenishment Agricultural Workers, Reporting requirements,and Special Agricultural Workers.

Reporting shall be to the Federal Government and to any individualreplenishment agricultural worker.(b) The statute requires the Director of the Bureau of Census, on the basisof information which is reported to the Federal Government, to estimate(1) The number of special agricultural workers employed in seasonal agriculturalservices in the United States at any time during the fiscal year and(2) The average number of ``man-days'' of labor performed by these workersduring the fiscal year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(For purposes of this part, an alternative term ``work-day'' is adoptedand incorporated into the text in lieu of ``man-day'' and means any daywhen at least four (4) hours are worked.)(c) The regulations contained in this part are issued in accordance withsection 210A of INA in order to establish the rules necessary to carryout the provisions of INA. (d) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has cleared the paperworkrequirements of this regulation at andSection;andSection; 502.11, 502.12, and502.13, and of Forms ESA-92 and WH-501R (optional), under control numbers1215-0148, 1215-0168, and 1215-0169. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 502.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and scope. </ITAG>(a) The INA was amended by the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)in 1986, in order to more effectively control illegal immigration to theUnited States and to make certain changes in the system for legal immigration.(b)(1) Section 210 of the INA provides that the Attorney General shalladjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted fortemporary residence if the Attorney General determines that the alien residedin the United States and performed work in seasonal agricultural servicesin the United States for at least 90 ``man-days'' during the 12-month periodending on May 1, 1986. An individual so legalized is called a special agriculturalworker (SAW). A special agricultural worker is given an Immigration andNaturalization Service (INS) Alien Registration Number in the A90000000series. (2) Section 210A of the INA provides that before the beginning of eachfiscal year (beginning 1990 and ending 1993), the Secretaries of Laborand Agriculture shall jointly determine the number (if any) of replenishmentagricultural workers (RAWs) to be admitted to the United States, or otherwiseacquire the status of aliens lawfully admitted for temporary residence,to meet a shortage of agricultural workers. A replenishment agriculturalworker will be identified by an INS Alien Registration Number in a series(within the A90000000 series) that INS will announce at a later date. (Atechnical amendment to this regulation will be issued to specify the ``Anumber'' series for replenishment agricultural workers when announced byINS.)(c) This regulation establishes a method whereby an employer must assembleemployment information on certain resident alien workers employed in seasonalagricultural services to be reported to the Federal Government and to anyreplenishment agricultural worker. This will assist the Secretaries ofLabor and Agriculture in determining the number of replenishment agriculturalworkers, if any, to be admitted, and will assist the replenishment agriculturalworker in establishing a work history to retain legal status and avoiddeportation, and so that after three (3) consecutive years after admissionthe worker can apply for and be granted permanent residency in the UnitedStates. After five (5) years with such work history the worker can applyfor naturalization. The work history needed is 90 work-days a year employedin seasonal agricultural services for three consecutive years after admissionto retain legal status and qualify for permanent residency, and for fiveyears to apply for citizenship. The Act and these regulations require reportingby the employer to the Federal Government and to the replenishment agriculturalworker on employment in seasonal agricultural services from October 1,1988, until September 30, 1992. (d) Any person who hires any worker must complete the Employment EligibilityVerification Form (INS Form I-9). Any resident alien who is identifiedwith an INS Alien Registration Number (``A number'') in the A90000000 serieson the I-9 Form (including any replenishment agricultural worker, who willbe identified with an INS Alien Registration Number in a series, withinthe A90000000 series, that INS will announce at a later date) and who isemployed in seasonal agricultural services, is an employee subject of thispart (termed `` reportable worker''). Employers cannot reliably determinewhether such an employee is a special agricultural worker since employeescannot be required to document such status to anyone other than INS (see8 CFR 274a.2(b)(v)). (e) The provisions of section 210A(b)(2) of INA establish reporting requirementsapplicable to the employment of certain workers in seasonal agriculturalservices. These regulations require that for the period beginning October1, 1988, and ending September 30, 1992,_(1) Any person or entity employing any reportable worker in seasonal agriculturalservices for at least one work-day shall report employment informationto the Federal Government each quarter; (2) Any person or entity employing any replenishment agricultural workerin seasonal agricultural services for at least one work-day shall reportemployment information directly to the replenishment agricultural workerindividually on a pay period basis at the time of each wage payment andno less frequently than twice per month (as well as to the Federal Governmenteach quarter).  (f) Any employment of a reportable worker for at least one work-day inseasonal agricultural services is subject to the reporting requirementsto the Federal Government. Additionally, any employment of a replenishmentagricultural worker (who will be identified with an INS Alien RegistrationNumber in a series within the A90000000 series that INS will announce ata later date) in seasonal agricultural services is subject to both thereporting requirements to the Federal Government and to the individualworker.  (g) The certified report submitted by an employer to the Federal Governmentshall contain the number of work-days of employment in seasonal agriculturalservices performed by each reportable worker employed for at least oneworkday during the preceding fiscal quarter. This information will be providedto the Commissioner of the INS who will determine which reportable workersare special agricultural workers. Information concerning them will be providedto the Director of the Bureau of Census for use in_  (1) Estimating the number of special agricultural workers employed inseasonal agricultural services;  (2) Determining the average number of work-days performed by special agriculturalworkers; and  (3) Reporting to the Congress.  (h) Any person or entity who employs a reportable worker in seasonal agriculturalservices will meet the requirements of this regulation when_  (1) Accurate records are kept and reports are made as required under thispart to the Federal Government (see andSection;andSection; 502.10, 502.11,and 502.12);  (2) Accurate records are kept and reports are made as required under thispart to each replenishment agricultural worker (see andSection;andSection;502.10, 502.11, and 502.13);  (3) The same transportation provided to any replenishment agriculturalworker is provided to any other worker (see andSection; 502.17);  (4) There is no prohibited discrimination against any replenishment agriculturalworker (see andSection; 502.15); and,  (5) A replenishment agricultural worker is not knowingly furnished falseor misleading information concerning the terms, conditions, or existenceof agricultural employment with respect to the disclosure, posting, andrecordkeeping requirements found in section 301(a), (b), and (c) of theMigrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA), 29 U.S.C.1801 <T3>et seq. </T3>(see andSection;andSection; 502.13, 502.14, and 502.16).  (i) An employer of a reportable worker who is subject to the requirementsof the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. 201 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and/or MSPA is required to comply with both the requirementsof this part and the statutory labor standards protections provided byFLSA and/or MSPA.  (j) The Secretary of Labor may impose sanctions pursuant to section 210A(f)(4)(C)of the INA, which incorporate the penalty provisions of MSPA. Accordingly,these regulations provide that the Secretary of Labor is empowered to imposean assessment and to collect a civil money penalty of not more than $1,000for each violation. In addition, the Secretary may seek a temporary orpermanent restraining order in a United States District Court. Criminalpenalties under 18 U.S.C. 1001 may also be applicable for submission offalse information (see andSection;andSection; 502.26).  (k) Subparts A and B set forth the substantive regulations relating toany employer of a reportable worker. These subparts cover the applicabilityof the Act, the recordkeeping and reporting requirements, antidiscriminationprotections, the prohibition against furnishing false statements, and theequal transportation requirements.  (l) Subpart C sets forth enforcement responsibility and procedure.  (m) Subpart D sets forth the rules of practice for administrative hearingson the assessment of civil money penalties.  (n) The Department of Labor has developed two (2) forms for carrying outthe purposes of the Act:  (1) The optional form WH-501R is offered to assist in carrying out therequirement that each replenishment agricultural worker receive a reporteach pay period in the form of a certificate from each employer indicatingthe number of work-days (any day with at least four (4) hours worked) employedin seasonal agricultural services; and  (2) The Work-Day Report (Form ESA-92) required to be submitted to theFederal Government, to certify the number of work-days performed in seasonalagricultural services by each reportable worker each quarter in which anyreportable worker was employed in seasonal agricultural services for atleast one work-day. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 502.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions pertaining solely to a reportable worker employed in seasonalagricultural services. </ITAG> For purposes of this part:  (a) ``Act'' and ``INA'' mean the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amendedby the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA 8 U.S.C. 1101 <T3>et seq.</T3>), with references particularly to andSection;andSection; 210and 210A.
