The texturalcharacterization of samples was effected by adsorption of CO/sub 2/ at273 K and of N/sub 2/ at 77 K, as well as by mercury porosimetry. VRMNpresents the highest value of the apparent surface area and of the specificsurface area of mesopores and macropores, while the greatest value ofthe cumulative specific surface area of macropores corresponds to VRMOC.The micropore volume accessible to CO/sub 2/ at 273 K increases in boththe HCl and the HNO/sub 3/ treatment and decreases in the HF and heattreatments. The HCl and HNO/sub 3/ treatments produce an increase ofthe mesoporosity; the HF treatment seems to affect in a special way themesoporous texture. Furthermore, the heat treatment gives rise to a notabledevelopment of the macroporosity.</TEXT></DOC>
