To properly analyzethis system, multi-ion calculations are required, due to the fact thatthe rare-earth ions occupy two crystallographically inequivalent sites,each of which is fourfold degenerate. In the first part of this paper,we describe a procedure for performing multi-ion crystal field calculationswhich is based on the use of space group transformation matrices to generateboth the positions and local axes of the crystallographically equivalentions. The principal advantage of this method is that all symmetry informationcan be imported from data files, rather than being coded into the computerprogram, allowing for a program which is completely structure independent.Another advantage is the ease with which mixed rare-earth systems [suchas (Er/sub x/Pr/sub 1-//sub x/){sub 2}Fe{sub 14}B ] can be analyzed.In the second part of the paper, we present results obtained by the abovedescribed method for the system (Er/sub x/Pr/sub 1-//sub x/){sub 2}Fe{sub14}B, including predictions of both the low-temperature magnetic structureand the magnetic phase diagram.</TEXT></DOC>
