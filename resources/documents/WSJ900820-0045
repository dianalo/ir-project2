Hisham Nazer, the kingdom's oil minister, confirmed overthe weekend that Saudi Arabia intends to expand output asmuch as two million barrels a day. At a news conferenceSaturday night in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he said the actionwill be taken with or without the approval of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</LP><TEXT>   The increase would make up about half of the four millionbarrels a day lost to world oil markets from the latestMiddle East crisis.   Some other oil exporters with spare capacity -- includingVenezuela and the United Arab Emirates -- are expected tohelp fill the gap, Mr. Nazer said. Indeed, in interviews overthe weekend, senior Venezuelan government officials confirmedtheir country is ready to increase output soon. Venezuela isbelieved capable of pumping an extra 500,000 barrels of oil aday.   Saudi Arabia's decision had been expected, but oil marketshave remained jittery because neither the Saudis nor theVenezuelans had publicly declared their plans. Now, barringadverse new military developments in the crisis, the formalstatements by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela should helpstabilize prices. Last week, the price of the benchmark U.S.crude toppped $28, a total increase of about $8 since Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.   &quot;I wouldn't be surprised to see prices back off a bitnear-term,&quot; said Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst atPaineWebber Inc. He added, &quot;The Saudi decision over theweekend means that Saddam Hussein has lost the oil war.&quot;   Citing the negative impact on developing countries from athreatened oil shortage, Mr. Nazer had strongly urged SadekBoussena, Algeria's oil minister and OPEC president, to callan emergency OPEC meeting to take steps to hold down runawaypetroleum prices. He had noted that the developing countrieswould be hurt most by higher oil costs and tight oilsupplies.   &quot;Developing countries are suffering,&quot; Mr. Nazer said.   According to a copy of a letter to Mr. Boussena obtainedby this newspaper, Saudi Arabia believes that high oilinventories have helped cushion the impact of the embargoagainst Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes on richer, industrialcountries. Developing countries have neither the storage norfinancing to keep comfortable inventories. It is understoodVenezuela shares that Saudi view.   The letter states that continued tight supplies andescalating prices &quot;will precipitate deep economic recessionin (developing countries) since their degree of dependence onoil for their energy requirements is far greater than that ofindustrialized countries.&quot;   Also, other Persian Gulf sources who support immediateaction suggested that all OPEC members, if they don't dosomething to curb escalating oil prices, could see theirmarkets shrink, just as in the 1970s. &quot;If OPEC doesn't learnfrom its past mistakes, it is doomed,&quot; one Arab officialsaid.   Despite such pleas, Mr. Boussena has resisted calls for aspecial OPEC meeting. He has been quoted as worrying that thecontroversial issues at stake -- including the contentionover Kuwait's representation -- could &quot;scuttle&quot; OPEC.   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, alsohas rejected the idea of an immediate OPEC meeting,reportedly calling the proposal an excuse for other membersof OPEC to increase production at Iraq's expense.   Several other countries also oppose a meeting at thistime, although some, such as Iran, are said to be increasingoutput anyway to take advantage of higher prices and toexpand their market shares while Iraq and Kuwait aresidelined. Even including the exiled government of Kuwait,only four other countries fully support the joint request ofSaudi Arabia and Venezuela for a special meeting to considerproduction levels.   OPEC's late-July agreement, which set a production ceilingof 22.5 million barrels a day for the 13 member nations, wasintended to push the group's reference price, based on theaverage of a basket of seven crudes, to $21 a barrel. At thenews conference Saturday, Mr. Nazer noted that the price ofthe basket is well above $25 a barrel and that production hasdropped to 18.5 million barrels a day. &quot;The shortage of fourmillion barrels a day can increase if the tension continues,&quot;Mr. Nazer said, adding: &quot;This should be made up for by allOPEC members together.&quot;   He predicted, however, that the situation would improve ifthe U.S. and other industrialized countries free up theirstrategic reserves of crude oil. And he confirmed that ifothers in OPEC don't endorse production increases by thosewith spare capacity, Saudi Arabia plans to go it alone. Buthe emphasized that Saudi Arabia couldn't do it all alone.   Like Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates could supply anextra 500,000 barrels a day, said Mr. Nazer. Still, that&quot;would leave us one million barrels less&quot; than the amountlost to oil markets so far, he said. He urged that all othersin OPEC with spare capacity join in the effort.   Mr. Nazer didn't give OPEC much more time. He told thereporters that if the emergency meeting proposed by thekingdom fails to get off the ground by today or tomorrow, &quot;itwill be left for each member state to decide alone&quot; onincreases. &quot;What we want to do is go through OPEC,&quot; he said,&quot;but if they refuse to meet, they leave us no alternative.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
