Attorney General Dick Thornburgh pledged to a religious audienceThursday that the department will continue to fight pornography onall fronts.   However, he said in regard to material involving children,``Pornography to me is degrading to human dignity in every form,but it is most degrading to the human dignity of those who areinnocent and defenseless and who are preyed upon by criminalactors.''   The number of indictments for federal obscenity violationsdropped from 66 in 1987 to 37 last year, according to figures ofcases compiled by the Justice Department's National ObscenityEnforcement Unit.   The figures are incomplete because U.S. attorneys are notrequired to report obscenity prosecutions to the JusticeDepartment, said Joseph Krovisky, a department spokesman.   But during the same period, the number of federalchild-pornography prosecutions increased from 281 in 1987 to 406last year, according to the unit's figures.   FBI figures also reflect a decline in prosecutions involvinghard-core adult pornography. The number of ``open matters'' droppedfrom 355 in 1987 to 302 in 1988 to 194 in the first nine months ofthe 1989 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30.   Thornburgh said the statistics don't reflect the length ofinvestigations, and he said the department would not ``abandon anypart of our across-the-board effort.''   He also stressed that law enforcement officials consideringobscenity charges must be mindful of First Amendment protectionsagainst censorship.   ``We must be attentive to the preservation of First Amendmentrights just as we are attentive to the enforcement of laws thatattack those practices that lie outside the area of First Amendmentprotection,'' the attorney general said.   Critics of the obscenity unit, which was set up in 1987 byThornburgh's predecessor, Edwin Meese III, have charged thatprosecutions for obscenity violations trampled on constitutionalrights.   Obscenity prosecutions involving adult pornography often involvesensitive First Amendment questions that law enforcement officialsare not often eager to confront.   In his speech to the Religious Alliance Against Pornography,Thornburgh noted the difficulties making obscenity charges stick.Eight obscenity counts against a Los Angeles pornographer weredismissed by a judge who couldn't define a prevailing communitystandard for obscenity, Thornburgh said.   But the defendant, Rubin Gottesman, was convicted of achild-pornography violation because the star of many of his videoswas a minor. Last week Gottesman was sentenced to a year in prisonand fined $100,000.   Before Meese set up the obscenity unit, in response torecommendations made by a commission he appointed to studypornography, there were very few federal obscenity prosecutions,said John Weston, a Los Angeles attorney who defends distributorsof X-rated material.   Thornburgh said the department had virtually stamped outmailings of sexually oriented advertising for X-rated videos andother pornography. The department has obtained convictions of 11individuals and 17 corporations since the so-called PostPorninvestigation began last year, he said.   ``I'm sure you've noticed, as we have at Justice, a dramaticdecline in complaints,'' Thornburgh said. ``In most regions of thecountry, those mailings simply don't go out anymore.''</TEXT></DOC>
