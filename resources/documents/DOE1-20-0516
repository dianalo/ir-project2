Average drivage rate over1977-1987 was 63 m/month, with labor productivity at 1.3-1.6 m{sup 3}/manand shift. Considerable improvements are required: drivage rates shouldbe up to 260 m/month; team output should be 6 m/shift as compared with2 m/shift by the best drivage teams at present. Automation of the drivagecycle is recommended. Use of separate drilling machines and loaders canonly give a maximum drivage rate of 180 m/month. Particular attentionis therefore given to drivage complexes on a single base with quick detachableunits (modular design). These include the Perard Trackheader (UK) andimpact rock splitting machines such as the model DUO produced by MiningDevelopments (UK) and similar machines made by Secoma (France), Kone(Finland) and others. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
