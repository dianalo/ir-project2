Western Gas Processors, Ltd.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-1718-000]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">August 2, 1989.</ITAG>Take notice that on June 29, 1989, Western Gas Processors, Ltd. (WesternGas), Suite 609, 10701 Melody Drive, Denver, Colorado 80234, filed in DocketNo. CP89-1718-000 a petition under Rule 207 of the Commission's Rules ofPractice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.207) for a declaratory order requestingthat the Commission disclaim jurisdiction over certain natural gas pipeline,compression, and processing facilities located in Glasscock, Midland, Reaganand Upton Counties, Texas (collectively referred to as the Midkiff System),currently owned by El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), which El Pasois concurrently seeking to abandon by conveyance to Western Gas. WesternGas requests that once such facilities are abandoned by El Paso and acquiredand operated by Western Gas, the Commission determine that they will constitutenon-jurisdictional gathering and processing facilities under Section 1(b)of the Natural Gas Act (NGA).It is stated that El Paso currently operates the Midkiff System which wasconstructed to gather and process casinghead gas produced from oil wellslocated in the Sprayberry Field of west Texas for El Paso's own systemsupply. Western Gas further states that currently, natural gas from morethan 1000 casinghead gas wells is gathered into the Midkiff System. TheMidkiff System consists of the following facilities: (i) The Pembrook Station,with five field compressor units totaling 6,750 ISO horsepower locatedin Upton County, Texas; (ii) the Driver Station, with three field compressorunits totaling 6,000 ISO horsepower located in Midland County, Texas; (iii)the Midkiff Station, with thirteen field compressor units totaling 23,760ISO horsepower located in Reagan County, Texas; (iv) the Midkiff DehydrationPlant, with a design inlet capacity of 136,000 Mcf per day (Mcfd), locatedin Reagan County, Texas; (v) The Midkiff Gasoline Extraction Plant, witha design inlet capacity of 168,000 Mcfd, located in Reagan County, Texas;(vi) the Upton to TNG Pembrook Line, with approximately 12.8 miles of 12\3/4\&quot;O.D. pipeline, and approximately 1.6 miles of 6\5/8\&quot; O.D. pipeline, andnecessary appurtenances and connecting well-tie lines, beginning at theUpton County Line and terminating at the retired TNG Pembrook Plant alsolocated in Upton County, Texas; (vii) the Pembrook to Midkiff Line, withapproximately 0.1 miles of 24&quot; O.D. pipeline and 12.7 miles of 16&quot; O.D.pipeline, and necessary appurtenances, beginning at the Pembrook Stationand terminating at the Midkiff Plant; (viii) the Driver to Midkiff Line,with approximately 6.3 miles of 26&quot; O.D. pipeline, and necessary appurtenances,beginning at the Driver Station and terminating at the Midkiff Plant; (ix)the TNG Pembrook to Midkiff Line, with approximately 7.5 miles of 10\3/4\&quot;O.D. pipeline, and necessary appurtenances, beginning at the retired TNGPembrook Plant and terminating at the Midkiff Plant; and (x) the SprayberryGathering System, with approximately 185 miles of gathering and well-tiepipelines, ranging in size from 23\3/8\&quot; O.D. to 30&quot; O.D. Western Gas statesthat the Sprayberry Gathering System also includes approximately 875 milesof non-jurisdictional and non-certificated gathering lines which connectthe over 1000 casinghead gas wells in the Sprayberry Field into the presentlycertificated facilities in the system.Western Gas submits that an examination of the Midkiff System facilitiesclearly discloses that their exclusive function is to gather and processnatural gas, a non-jurisdictional activity under the NGA. It is also statedthat the throughput in the Midkiff System is no longer primarily dedicatedto El Paso's system supply, but instead is sold directly to others.\1\<NOTE/> Thus, according to Western Gas, the utilization of thesefacilities as providing El Paso a source of system supply has changed dramaticallysince their construction. It is stated that the Midkiff System can no longerbe viewed simply as an extension of interstate pipeline supply facilitiesinto a production area. Rather, Western Gas states that the Midkiff Systemmay be viewed as a regional gathering and processing system which can provideresidue gas and salable liquids to markets far beyond the reach of theEl Paso system. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ See El Paso application to abandon the Midkiff Systemin Docket No. CP89-1722-000. Western Gas states that following the abandonment of these facilities byEl Paso, Western Gas intends to operate the Midkiff System as an independentgathering and processing system much like the facilities Western Gas currentlyowns and operates in other regions. While Western Gas states it will providegathering and processing services for El Paso's remaining system gas suppliesbehind the system, as previously indicated, the bulk of these suppliesis no longer dedicated to El Paso. As a result, for the system to becomean economically viable venture, Western Gas states it will be necessaryfor it to attract as many additional users in the area as possible, andthis task is made more difficult by the existence of competing non-jurisdictionalgatherers and processors, such as Phillips Petroleum Company and UnionOil Company of California, which are currently operating in the SprayberryField. Western Gas states that other non-jurisdictional gatherers and processorswhich are currently operating in the area of the Sprayberry Field include:Getty Gas Gathering, Inc., Inerfin Gas Processing Corp., Tipperary GatheringInc., Davis Gas Processors, Inc., Tri-Star Energy, Inc., Texaco, Inc.,Adobe Oil andamp; Gas Corp., Amax Oil andamp; Gas Corp. and OXY USA, Inc. Western states it intends to meet this competition through the infusionof additional investment into the aging Midkiff Plant and related facilities.By modernizing and automating existing equipment, Western Gas states itwill minimize fuel and other costs and increase the efficiencies of currentextraction operations. Western further states that it is currently discussingthese plans in negotiations with a number of behind-the-plant producersin the area in order to ensure that their production will be committedto the Midkiff System, thereby maximizing both Midkiff throughput and theeconomies of its gas processing operations. According to Western Gas, itsacquisition and operation of the Midkiff System facilities as a non-jurisdictional,independent gathering and processing system will result in the provisionof more efficient services than are currently being provided in the area,and will enhance regional competition, thus benefitting the current usersof these services and hopefully attracting additional production investmentinto this area. <T3>Comment date: </T3>August 23, 1989, in accordance with the first subparagraphof Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">3.
