No one was injured in the sinking late Tuesday of the 400-footBahia Paraiso, which began leaking diesel fuel after striking rocksSaturday, the government news agency Telam reported, citing a navycommunique.   Peter Wilkniss, director of the Antarctic program of the U.S.National Science Foundation, said it wasn't known how many gallonsof oil had spilled but that it could be an ``incurable disaster.''   The foundation has said the Antarctic could face ecologicalcalamity if all 250,000 gallons aboard the ship spilled.   ``The ship rolled over, is lying on its side almost fully belowthe water,'' Wilkniss told ABC's Good Morning America today.   ``This is a very enclosed area. It's a bay ... bounded by aglacier and some islands and our (research) station. So if the oilgoes into the area then it will have an effect on the shoreline, onthe ice, on the animals, the organisms, on the sediments,'' he added.   The depth of the water was not immediately known.   Officials from the National Science Foundation, Greenpeace, and aU.S. research facility near the wreck said leaking fuel had killedkrill, a shrimp-like crustacean that is the main food of the baleenwhale and a vital part of the Antarctic food chain.   ``The krill are dying; they are literally jumping out of thewater,'' the New Zealand Press Association quoted Greenpeacespokesman Peter Bogart as saying. ``Seabirds attracted by the krillare diving into the slick ... It's a real environmental disaster inno uncertain terms.''   Bogart said the information was relayed by an officer at the U.S.Palmer Research Station, two miles from the wreck. A stationspokesman, talking to The Associated Press by telephone on conditionof anonymity, said leaking oil had caused a 10-mile slick.   More than 300 tourists and crew were evacuated from the shipafter it ran aground about 600 miles south of Cape Horn. Salvageefforts were hampered by 50 mph winds.   The ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline andcanisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza stationnear the tip of the peninsula, the National Science Foundation saidin a statement released in Washington.   The tourists on board were to visit the research station,Wilkniss said.   ``It is an extremely dangerous passage to negotiate. There aremany islands, there are icebergs at times, there are many shoals androcks on the water,'' Wilkniss told Good Morning America. ``Theship, according to the charts we have provided to our mariners, tookthe wrong exit and entry ... to the station, and it was not awareand was going too fast and ran on some underwater rocks thatprobably were not on the Argentine chart,'' he said.   The ship sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and somediesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near Palmer Station, thefoundation said.   The accident occurred near two areas designated sites of specialscientific interest under the Antarctic Treaty, which permitsinternational exploration of the continent, the New Zealand agencysaid.   Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.   Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel itcarried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steeldrums so a spill is practically impossible.''   The 316 people on board, including 82 passengers and 234 crewmembers, were rescued by power boats and taken to Palmer Station.   Most were then taken by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islandsand airlifted to the South American mainland, but 104 crewmenremained at the station, said Jack Renerie of the National ScienceFoundation.</TEXT></DOC>
