These revisionsadd requirements for the control of gasoline vapors resulting from therefueling of vehicle fuel tanks at gasoline service stations (known asStage II) and were adopted by the State on March 2, 1988 as revisions topart 230, title 6 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations, entitled``Gasoline Dispensing Sites and Transport Vehicles.'' The revisions andthe rationale for EPA's proposed approval were fully explained in the NPRand will not be restated here since this final action does not differ fromthat discussed in the NPR. No public comments were received on the NPR.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>EPA has reviewed the State's submittal and finds that the Stage II programadopted by the State is equivalent to the program committed to in the SIPand, thus, adequately fulfills the State's SIP commitment. Therefore, EPAis approving New York's request to revise its SIP for ozone to revise part230, ``Gasoline Dispensing Sites and Transport Vehicles.''This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Clean Air Act,as amended.
