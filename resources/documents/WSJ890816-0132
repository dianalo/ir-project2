The Bell companies and their research arm, Bell Communications Research Inc., are testing a new technology designed to give the network &quot;self-healing&quot; or &quot;self-correcting&quot; abilities.    Emergency recovery systems became a subject of urgency in June 1988, when a fire gutted a two-story Illinois Bell Telephone Co. building in the Chicago suburb of Hinsdale, Ill. The fire crippled key elements of the company's fiber-optic system and knocked out service to 35,000 customers. At the time, the Hinsdale station was equipped to automatically shift only 25% of its load to other hubs. Although repair crews worked around the clock, service to some customers couldn't be restored for a couple of weeks.    The incident underscored the vulnerability of telephone hubs to natural disasters. Since the accident, Ameritech Corp., the parent of Illinois Bell, has pushed to develop a network protection plan. It is testing self-healing technology in Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio.    &quot;We took a look at what happened to us,&quot; says Robert W. Humes, vice president of operations planning at Ameritech's services unit. &quot;We realized that a customer has got to have more than one way to get around a point.&quot;    Moreover, threats to the phone system can come from many sources: Since strikes began earlier this month at four regional Bell companies, authorities have investigated more than 100 instances of vandalism and sabotage, including 70 cases of severed cables.    Neil Crystal, a district manager for evolution studies at Bellcore, explains that self-healing technology can give the telephone network the intelligence to re-direct phone traffic around severed cables or damaged central offices.    &quot;The system functions completely autonomously,&quot; says Mr. Crystal. But &quot;somebody eventually will need to fix the damage&quot; much in the same way that a doctor would need to treat an injury.    The self-healing network has a structure that differs markedly from the regular network, which generally uses a single-file formation to connect one central office with another, like a string of beads. An obvious problem with the conventional structure is that a major problem along the cable or in a central office can interrupt telephone service down the line. Central offices switch a telephone call from one facility to another until it reaches its destination.    In contrast, the self-healing network links each central office with optical fiber cable in a loop, or circle. Next, the central offices are equipped with a Ring Diversity Switch, a special device that duplicates signals and sends them in opposite directions on the ring, ensuring that at least one arrives even if there is a major service problem along the loop.    &quot;If you have a failure, the self-correcting network allows you to go around the problem area,&quot; explains John McPherson, executive vice president for BellSouth Corp.'s South Central Bell unit. South Central Bell began testing the technology in Jackson, Miss., earlier this month.    While self-healing technology holds promise for small and medium-sized switching hubs, such networks probably couldn't salvage a superhub like Ameritech's Hinsdale center, at least not yet.    To string together several big office complexes on a ring would require tremendous computer capacity in the network. Says Bellcore's Mr. Crystal: &quot;That capacity isn't here today.&quot;    An alternative to the self-healing approach is a one-for-one protection scheme. It would require the telephone companies to install an extra line traveling parallel to existing arteries, so that if one was damaged, traffic coud be switched to the standby system. However, the standby system wouldn't be very cost effective, because most of the time it would sit idle.    Still in the development stage is an intelligent advanced routing system that could channel traffic in other directions in case of failure. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which manufactures the Ring Diversified Switch, already uses a similar system, known as dynamic nonhierarchical routing, which changes network patterns to direct swelling rush-hour traffic.    To re-direct traffic when there is a break, the network would need to locate the cut and the traffic. To do that, Mr. Crystal says, special software must be developed and extra capacity added. What's more, he says, the network would need to monitor the system constantly for signs of damage. </TEXT></DOC>
