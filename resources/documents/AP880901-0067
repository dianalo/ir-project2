The flight arrived in Bangkok from Ho Chi Minh City, calledSaigon when it was the capital of the U.S.-backed South Vietnamgovernment, said spokesman Ross Petzing. A flight of 334 Amerasiansand relatives, the largest ever, landed here on Aug. 22, he said.   The Amerasians were fathered by U.S. servicemen and civiliansduring the war, which ended with the communist North Vietnamesevictory in April 1975. They have been emigrating to the UnitedStates under the United Nations-sponsored Orderly Departure Programsince September 1982.   Most of the children stay in Bangkok for a few days before goingto a U.S. refugee processing center in the Philippines forEnglish-language training and orientation to life in the UnitedStates.   Progress on humanitarian issues has been hampered by the lack ofdiplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.   Official Radio Hanoi said Tuesday that Vietnam's ForeignMinister Nguyen Co Thach has told the United States that majordifferences prevented resumption of talks on U.S. resettlement ofthousands of people who were detained in ``re-education camps''because of their ties to the Americans during the Vietnam War.   But Thach also announced that Vietnam was resuming cooperationon joint efforts to find the remains of nearly 1,800 Americanslisted as missing in action, or MIA, in the war.   Vietnam had suspended cooperation Aug. 3, complaining about whatit called America's ``hostile policy'' of isolating Vietnam to tryto force Hanoi's occupation troops out of Cambodia.   A U.S. technical team will travel to Hanoi in September to workout details for joint field survey and excavation activities inVietnam, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley saidTuesday.   She said a U.S. team also will visit Hanoi Sept. 5-8 to discussa plan to allow private American organizations to treat Vietnamwith war-related disabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
