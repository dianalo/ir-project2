Mr. Kemp's attack drew a sharp rebuke from the WhiteHouse, and Mr. Kemp issued a retraction, saying his use ofthe word &quot;gimmicks&quot; was &quot;less than artful&quot; and that thewithholding plan was &quot;a beneficial part of the president'soverall economic growth package.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   His criticism, made Saturday on CNN's &quot;Evans and Novak&quot;program, was cited with approval yesterday on CBS's &quot;Face theNation&quot; by both Republican presidential candidate PatrickBuchanan and James Carville, a top aide to Arkansas Gov. BillClinton, a Democratic presidential candidate.   &quot;I've never liked tax credits,&quot; Mr. Kemp said in his CNNinterview. &quot;Basically, those are gimmicks.&quot; Mr. Kemp didn'tsay what tax credits he was referring to, but he is known tohave little enthusiasm for investment tax credits. Mr. Bush'stax package includes a 15% investment tax allowance, which issimilar to an investment tax credit.   Mr. Kemp also described as a &quot;gimmick&quot; changes in thewithholding tables that would allow people whose paycheckwithholdings for federal taxes are larger than necessary toreceive more takehome pay. &quot;I cannot sit here on your showand retain my credibility and say that allowing peopleanother $30 a month is going to spur economic recovery,&quot; Mr.Kemp said. &quot;It isn't.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
