Advantagesinclude ease of pollutant exposure and monitoring physiological changesthat can advance our current understanding of responses of carbon andwater relations of foliage to well defined pollution stress regimes.Disadvantages are the uncertainties regarding the degree to which branchlevel responses represent responses to be expected when whole trees,including root systems, are exposed to chronic pollution stress. Theinfluence of pollutants on carbon allocation including photosynthesis,respiration, and translocation represents one area of information needthat can be productively addressed at the branch level to provide informationof relevance to understanding how large trees respond to pollutants underfield conditions. 26 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
