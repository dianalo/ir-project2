Bubba Smith sits under a tree, reading. Dick Butkus approaches, toting a football.    But this time the burly former football players aren't pushing beer; they're selling Bibles. And soon a curious Mr. Butkus snatches one, called &quot;The Book,&quot; from Mr. Smith and begins poring through it.    Celebrity testimonials, long a staple in selling more secular products, are just part of a recent move by Bible publishers to use modern marketing techniques. Like merchandisers of soap, cereal and automobiles, Bible companies are concocting slick packaging, going after demographic niches and spinning off new products.    &quot;They're now using the Harvard Business School approach to marketing, sometimes in very sophisticated ways,&quot; says John Dessauer, the director of a center for book-industry research at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. &quot;There's a big change in philosophy.&quot; And it is producing major changes in the $200-million-a-year retail market for Bibles.    As a nearly 2,000-year-old product -- and a book that tells a well-known story -- the Bible presents an unusual marketing challenge. For centuries, the approach focused on fresh translations -- more than 100 in English alone since about 1900 -- along with, of course, the Bible's continuing appeal to the faithful. Even in the modern era, publishers primarily tapped more-or-less captive markets, with half their sales made to churches and other quantity buyers. But publishers were relatively passive toward individual consumers.    With a rise in visibility of born-again Christianity, total Bible sales grew 10% or more annually from the late 1970s through 1983; annual sales included an estimated 15 million commercial copies by 1984. The conservative-Christianity movement also helped bring a new breed of marketer to religious publishing.    Bruce Ryskamp, the president of the Bible group of Zondervan Corp., a Grand Rapids, Mich., publisher, for example, had been a marketing executive for a Yellow Pages publisher. He says he decided in 1983 to work for Zondervan because &quot;I really think God was speaking to me.&quot;    &quot;Things have changed,&quot; says Robert Schwalb, vice president of Bible marketing for Thomas Nelson Publishers Inc. of Nashville, Tenn. &quot;For a long time the church had branded certain professions 'anti-God,' and advertising probably ranked right up there with pornography.&quot; Now, even such established publishers as Nelson are taking a new approach.    One of the leaders of the marketing vanguard has been Marion G. &quot;Pat&quot; Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network Inc., based in Virginia Beach, Va. In 1984 CBN teamed up with Tyndale House Publishers of Wheaton, Ill., to make a radical change in Bible marketing. &quot;We looked at it as a consumer product,&quot; says David Clark, the marketing vice president of CBN. &quot;What would it take to get people to pick this up?&quot;    To find out, the partners conducted consumer focus groups and surveyed mall shoppers -- and the results led to a repackaging of Tyndale's mainstay edition. They first picked an intriguingly vague title: &quot;The Book.&quot; They made it a paperback and picked a bold cover, after testing six. At $9.95, the price was held below what what they considered the psychologically crucial $10 barrier.    They distributed &quot;The Book&quot; through unconventional outlets -- including K marts, hardware stores and groceries -- using catchy displays. They lined up a New York advertising agency, prime television time and celebrity endorsements. The result: More than two million copies have been sold to date, and Tyndale's share of retail Bible sales now is estimated at 12.5%, up from 11% in 1983.    Now that sales of &quot;The Book&quot; are cooling off, Tyndale is trying to sustain its success with spinoffs. They include a &quot;one-year edition&quot; organized into daily chunks of reading; a children's version that has sold more than 650,000 copies; a religious board game along the lines of Trivial Pursuit, and &quot;The Book&quot; on cassette tapes. And last fall, Tyndale introduced &quot;The Story: From Adam to Armageddon,&quot; a chronological version.    While perhaps less ambitiously evangelical than CBN's project, Zondervan's efforts are elaborate. By the early 1980s, the company's readable yet literal-minded New International Version was enjoying ecumenical appeal. But it took a niche-marketing approach, led by Mr. Ryskamp, to make sales boom.    Mr. Ryskamp has introduced more than two dozen different splinter editions, helping raise Zondervan's Bible sales to more than $21 million last year, from $11.6 million in 1982. The NIV's share of retail Bible sales has risen to some 30% -- for the first time eclipsing, on a current basis, the venerable King James Version, a public-domain translation put out by several concerns.    Zondervan has targeted, among other segments, the Missouri Synod of Lutherans, with an edition featuring doctrinal notes; scholars, with five study editions; and schoolchildren, with an edition bound ruggedly like a textbook and printed in sans-serif type.    Now Mr. Ryskamp is pondering a large-print edition, in five volumes for easy handling; the book might carry added advice about death, illness, inheritance and other topics of interest to the elderly. Other possibilities: a Spanish-and-English edition aimed at Hispanic immigrants, and one for blacks, perhaps with &quot;black-English&quot; references.    Faced with the innovative competition and an overall flat market since 1984, Nelson, the biggest U.S. religious publisher, lost market share and now is trying to recover ground. Its &quot;Precious Moments Bible,&quot; illustrated with a popular line of cherubic children's characters, has sold more than a million copies in about a year.    Still, not all marketing strategies deliver. A spokesman for Reader's Digest Association Inc. says the Pleasantville, N.Y., publisher is &quot;generally pleased&quot; with sales of more than 500,000 copies of its condensed edition, introduced in 1982. But others maintain that the book hasn't materialized as the significant competitor it was expected to be.    And in their rush to create new versions, the publishers still arouse controversy. Some have gotten themselves into a theological thicket over the Apocrypha, for example, a group of books in the Roman Catholic Bible that Protestants don't recognize. Zondervan, from a fundamentalist Protestant heritage, is hesitant about an NIV translation of the Apocrypha. But Nelson is pursuing the Catholic market with editions that include it -- prompting criticism from some members of the larger Protestant market.    More troubling to publishers -- many of whom have evangelical as well as commercial motives -- are indications of a different problem: Despite the sales efforts, the number of regular Bible readers may be slipping. A Gallup survey this year found that only 11% of the respondents had said they read the Bible daily, compared with 15% in a 1982 survey. Says Mr. Ryskamp: &quot;All we can do is get the Bible to them. After that, it's in God's hands.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
