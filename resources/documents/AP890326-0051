(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Baby M, the New Jersey baby involved in amuch-publicized custody fight that prompted national interest insurrogate motherhood, turns 3 years old on Monday.   Her natural mother, Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, had agreed to beartificially inseminated and then give the child to the naturalfather, but reneged on the deal after the baby was born.   The girl, now known as Melissa Stern, now lives with her fatherand his wife, William and Elizabeth Stern of Tenafly.   ``I'm not at liberty to discuss'' where Melissa will celebrateher birthday, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said in a telephone interviewSunday from her home in Bayport, N.Y.   When she agreed under a $10,000 contract to bear the child, shewas a Brick Township housewife, married to Richard Whitehead. Sherejected the money and sought custody of the child.   In 1987, a lower court judge stripped her of all parentalrights, in a case in which the baby was referred to Baby M. But thestate Supreme Court restored parental and visitation rights to Mrs.Whitehead-Gould and outlawed surrogacy for pay in New Jersey.   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported that Melissa would spend theweekend with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and return to Tenafly on Monday.   A judge ruled in a visitation order last year that the childcould spend birthdays with the Sterns because she is being raisedin their home and ``children normally have birthday parties withtheir friends.''   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has since divorced Whitehead and remarried,and has become a campaigner against surrogacy. The Sternscontinually decline to be interviewed.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said Sunday that she planned to leaveMonday for the last two weeks of a 22-city tour to promote the bookshe co-wrote about the custody fight.</TEXT></DOC>
