Keating Jr. and two other former American ContinentalCorp. officers on charges that they fraudulently withdrew$975,000 from the company in the months before its April 1989bankruptcy petition.   Mr. Keating, former American Continental chairman, and theother officers, Judy Wischer and Andrew Ligget, initiated andapproved wire transfers from the company's bank in Februaryand March 1989 when it was contemplating bankruptcy, theindictment charged.</LP><TEXT>   Some of the funds were proceeds from the sale of AmericanContinental subordinated debentures, the indictment said.Those bondholders are pursuing a lawsuit to recover some $250million they claim to have lost after American sought Chapter11 bankruptcy-law protection and the bonds became practicallyworthless.   The funds described in the indictment were allegedlyreceived by Mr. Keating; Charles H. Keating III, Mr.Keating's son and former American Continental executive vicepresident; Robert Wurzelbacher, Mr. Keating's son-in-law andformer company senior vice president, and by Ms. Wischer'shusband, George Wischer, an American Continental vicepresident. Ms. Wischer was company president and Mr. Liggetwas its chief financial officer.   Although the funds were paid directly to the AmericanContinental officers, the transactions were treated as loansfrom Medema Homes of Utah, an American Continentalsubsidiary, which &quot;disguised the true nature of thetransaction,&quot; the indictment said.   The five-count indictment in Phoenix adds bankruptcy fraudto a long list of federal crimes charged against the seniorMr. Keating, Ms. Wischer and Mr. Ligget. The core of thegovernment's case has been brought in Los Angeles, where thesame individuals, as well as Mr. Wurzelbacher and the youngerMr. Keating, were indicted by a federal grand jury last monthon charges of fraud and racketeering related to the collapseof the company's former Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Associationunit.   Mr. Keating, Mr. Ligget and Ms. Wischer all pleadedinnocent to those charges.   In Los Angeles, Mr. Ligget's attorney, Peter Rosen, saidhis client is innocent of all charges against him. &quot;Thereisn't any evidence he received any funds or benefitedfinancially in any way beyond his salary. He wrote the checksor caused them to be written; he was the chief financialofficer doing what he was told to do.&quot;   Donald C. Randolph, lawyer for Ms. Wischer, also said hisclient is innocent.   Mr. Keating's attorney, Stephen C. Neal, couldn't bereached yesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
