A part of predicted heat balance and theresults of a preliminary measurement is reported. With the heat collectorinstalled on the east and west roofs, the heat efficiency decreases toabout 70% in May-September in Tokyo, compared with the installation onlyin the south roof. However, the factor of dependence on solar energyis 100% in this season. Therefore, there is no difference for effectivelyusing solar heat. The factor of dependence on solar heat, in terms ofannual heat balance including heating, is about 30% in January to February.The factor in April-November, only for hot water supply, is 100%. Theannual average is 77%. These values include heat recovered from the heatpump from the soil, by long-term heat storage. Items reported in thepaper include the improvement of thermal environment in the south roomby the sunroom, results of a preliminary test of heat media through storingand discharging the heat.
