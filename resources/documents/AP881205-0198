The government of President Raul Alfonsin had claimed victoryearlier Monday, saying the military rebellion was over. But thepublic was skeptical because rebel leader Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldinand many of the renegades remained at the Villa Martelli arsenal.   With the news that the last garrison now was in the hands of theauthorities, it appeared Alfonsin had quelled the third army mutinyin 20 months and the most serious threat so far to his government.   A military officer at Villa Martelli told reporters thatSeineldin turned over command of the unit to Gen. Isidro Caceres,according to the private news agency Diarios y Noticias.   The unidentified officer was quoted as saying that Seineldin``placed himself at the disposal of the appropriate military judge''and that he would be transferred Tuesday morning to a garrison to beimprisoned.   Shortly after, several army trucks left the arsenal carryingcheering troops, according to the report. It was not immediatelyknown where the trucks were headed.   The news agency quoted the officer as saying Seineldin assumed``all responsibility for his actions'' during the four-day mutiny,which began Thursday.   Political opponents had claimed Alfonsin made a deal with therebel soldiers and demanded that he reveal the terms.   An investigation began into a street battle between rebelsoldiers and demonstrators Sunday evening in which three people werekilled and 13 civilians and 12 policemen were injured, provincialpolice reported.   Patricio Echegaray, general secretary of the Communist Party,said Monday: ``The people in the streets smell treason in the(government's) claim to have squashed the rebels.   ``I'm sure that, in the near future, as a result of the back-roomnegotiations the government will try to impose an amnesty and bringan end to the trials of (officers) who participated in the stateterrorism during the last dictatorship.''   Echegaray's reference was to the military governments of 1976-83,which conducted a so-called ``dirty war'' against leftists in whichan estimated 9,000 people disappeared.   Alfonsin denies making a deal. Doubts stem from the fact that thegovernment did not immediately arrest and disarm the rebels, whosaid publicly they negotiated a truce rather than surrendered.   News reports said the mutineers handed over the infantry schoolat the Campo de Mayo base, and the 6th mechanized infantry regimentat Mercedes, only after being told to do so by Seineldin.   Maj. Luis Albert Brun, who led the mutineers at the infantryschool, said he expected the rebels to be allowed to return to theirunits without punishment.   The government has not said whether it will prosecute the rebels.   Earlier Monday, Seineldin helped dismantle barriers and retrieveland mines at the Villa Martelli arsenal. The government news agencyTelam said he would be sent to a military prison in the interior.   Rebel demands included an end to the prosecution of officers forhuman rights abuses in 1976-83 dictatorship, a change in themilitary hierarchy and better pay and equipment. The same demandswere behind similar uprisings in April 1987 and last January.   It was clear this time that the rebels had wide supportthroughout the army.   Five bases openly supported the mutineers and units at severalothers refused to help the government.   In contrast to the current situation, soldiers who participatedin the April 1987 uprising were arrested, held incommunicado andtaken to military prison.   Alfonsin also said after that revolt that the surrender wasunconditional. Soon afterward, however, three-fourths of the army'stop generals were removed and Alfonsin proposed legislation limitingprosecution for human rights offenses only to the highest-rankingofficers.   The street battle Sunday occurred when loyal troops within 100yards of the rebel base at the Villa Martelli arsenal began pullingback.   Several hundred people who had demonstrated against the rebellionsurged forward, hurling rocks and firebombs at rebel vehicles. Rebelsoldiers opened fire.   Police said two civilians and one policeman were killed. Theysaid earlier reports of a third civilian killed were wrong.   Echegaray said the two civilians killed were members of theCommunist Party. He called them ``martyrs for democracy.''   A bomb exploded Monday morning at an army building in downtownBuenos Aires, but caused no casualties. A woman who telephoned thenews agency Noticias Argentinas claimed responsibility for a groupcalling itself the Che Guevara Brigade and said the explosion was``homage to the dead at Villa Martelli.''</TEXT></DOC>
