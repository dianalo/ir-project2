WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Supreme Court nominee David Souter brushedaside questions Thursday about a letter he wrote nearly a decadeago opposing legislation that would have forced judges to makedecisions on abortions for teenagers.   Souter, making a round of courtesy calls in the Senate, toldreporters he would disclose what is ``constitutionallyappropriate'' at his confirmation hearings.   Meanwhile, one of the justices he will join if confirmed,Thurgood Marshall, said he'd never heard of Souter before he wasselected and suggested the nomination was a political move.   Marshall, in a dwindling liberal minority on the court with theretirement of Justice William J. Brennan, said he didn't thinkPresident Bush had ``ever stopped'' running for president and``this last appointment is the epitome of what he's been doing.''   Marshall commented in an interview Thursday night on ABC-TV's``Primetime Live.''   Abortion-rights advocates said they found no encouragement inSouter's letter, although it supported their position against arestrictive abortion bill that was before the New HampshireLegislature in 1981.   Still, the letter provided a rare glimpse at Souter's judicialactions on abortion and triggered new attempts to analyze how hewould change the Supreme Court's precarious balance on theemotional issue that has taken center stage in the debate over hisconfirmation.   The National Right to Life Committee, the leading anti-abortiongroup, said it concluded the letter ``reveals nothing'' aboutSouter's views on abortion or its legality.   President Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said of theletter, ``We have no reaction to it one way or the other.''   After meeting with Souter, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., went tothe White House to give Bush a progress report on how thenomination was going over on Capitol Hill.   Fitzwater quoted Thurmond as saying, ``I'm impresed with him''and ``I think he'll be just fine.'' Thurmond reported no one hasindicated they want to fight the nomination, Fitzwater said.   Souter dismissed questions about his views on abortion and otherissues as he continued meeting with members of the Senate, whichwill decide the fate of his nomination.   ``I think you should save any issue of that sort ... for theconfirmation hearing, where I'm sure that issue will beaddressed,'' he told reporters.   Souter met privately for an hour with the chairman of theJudiciary Committee, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who will presideover the hearings, which are expected to begin in September. Hethen met with other senators.   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the judge had told him he hadinsisted that his views on the 1973 Roe vs. Wadeabortion-legalizing decision not be asked if Bush were to nominatehim.   ``When he was invited to come down, he posed a requirement thatthere not be a question which he would be asked'' on that subject,said Specter after meeting with Souter.   ``I look forward to making my positions clear to the extent itis constitutionally appropriate'' when the hearings begin, Soutertold reporters.   Souter's letter, made available by the National Abortion RightsAction League, was written while he was a New Hampshire statesuperior court judge and was dated May 13, 1981.   He addressed it to the chairman of a state House committee andsaid he was directed by the full court to state its position on abill that would have provided for judges to rule on whetherunmarried minor pregnant women may have abortions in cases wherethey do not have a parent's consent.   He did not state a position on the bill's basic requirement forparental consent but voiced opposition to the so-called judicialbypass option when there is no parental consent.   Souter wrote that the requirement would ``leave it to individualjustices of this court to make fundamental moral decisions ...without any standards to guide the individual judges.''   State Superior Court Chief Justice Richard Dunfey said heinstructed Souter to write the letter because Souter was chairmanof the court's legislative committee.   ``My recollection is that discussion on abortion itself neverincluded right or wrong,'' Dunfey said.   New Hampshire abortion-rights activist Peg Dobbie said Souter'sletter was critical to successful efforts to kill the legislation.Similar letters signed by other judges were used to oppose laterbills.   Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights ActionLeague, said the letter was reason for the Senate to probe Souter'sviews on constitutional issues surrounding abortion but did notreveal his inclinations on the central abortion issue.   ``No one wants to find a silver lining in this nomination morethan we do, but this letter does not provide it,'' she said.   Dawn Johnsen, the group's legal director, said the letter``suggests that Judge Souter might vote with conservatives on thecourt to allow a law that mandated parental consent without anyescape valve for teen-agers who are victims of child abuse andfamily violence,'' and are unable to discuss an abortion with theirparents.   ``I don't see much reason for encouragement,'' Johnsen said.``At best it's neutral. It's a complicated letter on just thejudicial bypass.''   At the time of Souter's letter, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruledthat states could require a parent's consent for a minor to obtainan abortion so long as the state provided an alternative route,such as a judge's approval. The court in June of this year ruled ina pair of cases that a state may require notice to both parents aslong as judicial bypass is an option.   Melanne Verveer, executive vice president of the liberal Peoplefor the American Way, said the letter seemed to support Bush'sdepiction of Souter as a judge not inclined to judicial activism.   She pointed to a section of the letter in which Souter said thecourts have been criticized for ``the imposition of individualjudges' views in the guise of applying constitutional terms ofgreat generality.'' He added that the provision of the bill he wasopposing ``would force the Superior Court to engage in just suchacts of unfettered personal choice.''   ``It is of concern,'' Verveer said.</TEXT></DOC>
