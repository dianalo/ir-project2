The bomb, which detonated upon impact, set off a small fire inthe ship's forecastle that was quickly extinguished, said Lt. BruceCole, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.   The fighter, a single-seat F-A-18 Hornet, had just taken offfrom the aircraft carrier USS Midway when the incident occurred.   ``We don't know yet why it happened,'' said another spokesman,Cmdr. Mark Baker. ``The pilot has been returned to the Midway andhe is being asked that question now.''   Cole said the five sailors received minor injuries ``as a resultof flying glass and concussion'' from the exploding bomb. Thesailors were treated on board their ship, and the Navy does notplan to release their names until their families are told.   The carrier and cruiser were conducting ``routine weaponstraining'' about 32 miles from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean,Cole and Baker said.   Cole said the F-A-18's pilot ``inadvertently'' dropped the bomb,apparently as it passed over the nearby cruiser. The spokesmen saidthey did not know the altitude of the plane or how far apart thetwo ships were.   Although the bomb left a five-foot hole in the deck near thecruiser's bow, it did no damage to the outer hull, Cole said.   Such a ship is ``nuclear capable,'' but as they always do thespokesmen refused to confirm whether nuclear weapons were aboard.Such weapons _ anti-submarine rockets that are being phased out _would be carried in a forward compartment of the ship.   The cruiser was returning to the U.S. base at Diego Garcia underits own power, Baker said.   The bomb, a Mark 82 model, is four feet long and 14 inches indiameter. It is a free-fall weapon that can be used against shipsor land targets and can be adapted for use as a shrapnel weaponagainst humans, one Navy source said.   The plane is a jet, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and firstput into service in 1982, which can serve as either a fighter or anattack bomber.   The incident occurred at 9:06 p.m. local time, Cole said.   Standard time charts give that as the equivalent of 11:06 a.m.EST, but the Navy gave the eastern time equivalent as 7:06 a.m.There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.   Both the Midway, which is one of the Navy's oldest aircraftcarriers, and the Reeves are based in Yokosuka, Japan.   The 533-foot Reeves is a Leahy class guided missile cruiserdisplacing 7,800 tons fully loaded and carrying a complement of 450officers and enlisted men, It was commissioned in 1964.   The 980-foot-long Midway, displacing 64,000 tons at full load,was commissioned in 1945 and has undergone a number of overhauls.It carries a crew of approximately 2,500 officers and enlisted men.   The accident was at least the sixth aboard a Navy ship, notcounting sailors lost overboard, since the April 19 turretexplosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa that killed 47 sailors.   Only Sunday, a landing accident aboard the training carrier USSLexington off Florida killed a Navy student pilot and four membersof the deck crew and injured 19 others.   The others:   _May 9. Six sailors are killed and five injured in a fire aboardthe USS White Plains, a supply ship, in the Atlantic.   _May 13: Two sailors die in a pump room fire aboard the aircraftcarrier USS America in the Atlantic.   _May 19. A Marine is drowned when a landing craft from theamphibious landing ship USS Duluth overturns during exercises offAustralia.   _Aug. 23.
