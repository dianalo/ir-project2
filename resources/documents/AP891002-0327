Monday offered to sell the naturalgas and oil reserves of its Texas Oil andamp; Gas Corp. subsidiary inwhat is being viewed on Wall Street as a concession to shareholders.   Texas Oil andamp; Gas has been a disappointment to USX since it wasacquired in 1986 in a $3 billion stock swap.   ``I think shareholders have just lost their patience,'' saidDavid N. Fleischer of Prudential Bache Securities.   USX is showing a willingness to part with assets that probablywill appreciate if held long enough but could enhance the stock'svalue now by being sold, he said.   ``This is a very strong statement that they're committed toshareholders,'' Fleischer said.   Chief among the shareholders who stand to benefit is corporateraider Carl Icahn, who is holding an 11 percent stake in USX.   Fleischer and analyst Frank Bracken of Fidelity Investments ofBoston said they valued the reserves at around $1.5 billion. A saleis anticipated by year's end, said USX spokesman William E. Keslar,who declined to say how USX values the reserves.   The Pittsburgh-based oil and steel giant said it has retainedthe investment banking firm First Boston Corp. to handle the sale.The reserves are principally located in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,Louisiana, Colorado and Kansas.   After racking up impressive operating income of $547 million and$377 million in 1984 and 1985 respectively, Texas Oil andamp; Gasreported an operating loss of $21 million the year USX acquired it,then broke about even with $2 million the next year and lost $31million last year.   ``I estimate that TXO's producing properties are losing $30 to$40 million per year on an operating basis,'' said Fleischer.   The sale, besides boosting Texas Oil andamp; Gas's earnings, will helpwith USX's goal of reducing debt and may lead to the repurchase ofstock or raise the dividend, he said.   USX had been pinning its hopes for a turnaround at Texas Oil andamp;Gas on the prospect that natural gas prices will surge.   Texas Oil andamp; Gas has 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas inreserve, about a quarter of the 3.5 trillion cubic feet held by theother USX subsidiary, Marathon Oil Co. Texas Oil andamp; Gas has 28million barrels of oil, or 3 percent of Marathon's 766 million.   The sale would not affect gas gathering, the bulk of Texas Oil andamp;Gas's business, or contract drilling, USX said.   Gas gathering accounted for $538 million of Texas Oil andamp; Gas's$937 million in total sales last year. Drilling and other activiteshad sales totaling $41 million.   The remainder, or $358 million, came from petroleum sales.</TEXT></DOC>
