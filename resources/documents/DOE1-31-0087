The converter is a phosphor or scintillator material whichis modified to block ambient light. The intensifier includes fiber opticsinput and output face plates with a photocathode-microchannel plate amplifier-phosphorcombination. Incoming radiation is converted to visible light by theconverter which is piped into the intensifier by the input fiber opticsface plate. The photocathode converts the visible light to electronswhich are amplified by a microchannel plate amplifier. The electronsare converted back to light by a phosphor layer and piped out for viewingby the output fiber optics face plate. The converter-intensifier combinationmay be further combined with it's own radiation source or used with anindependent source.</TEXT></DOC>
