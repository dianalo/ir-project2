Hybrids containingthe human 10q+ chromosome had the human genes for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasethat has been mapped at 10q23-q25 and for C/sub {alpha}/ [the constantregion of TCRA (the {alpha}-chain locus of the T-cell antigen receptorgene)], but not for V/sub {alpha}/ (the variable region of TCRA). Hybridscontaining the human 14q- chromosome retained the V/sub {alpha}/genes.Thus the 14q11 breakpoint in the t(10;14) chromosome translocation directlyinvolves TCRA, splitting the locus in a region between the V/sub {alpha}/and the C/sub {alpha}/ genes. These results suggest that the translocationof the C/sub {alpha}/ locus to a putative cellular protooncogene locatedproximal to the breakpoint at 10q24, for which the authors propose thename TCL3, results in its deregulation, leading to T-cell leukemia. Sincehybrids with the 10q+ chromosome also retained the human terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasegene, it is further concluded that the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferaselocus is proximal to the TCL3 gene, at band 10q23-q24.</TEXT></DOC>
