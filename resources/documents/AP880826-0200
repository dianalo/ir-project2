Paul Simon defended U.S.sanctions against South Africa on Friday, the end of a five-dayvisit, and contended that most blacks support the measures.   Simon, an Illinois Democrat who ran unsuccessfully earlier thisyear for his party's presidential nomination, said the UnitedStates has the responsibility to protest South Africa's system ofrace discrimination.   Referring to silence in America when Adolf Hitler first beganpersecuting Jews, he said, ``We don't want to repeat that.''   Simon heads the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Africanaffairs and will have a major role in debate on pending legislationto stiffen U.S. sanctions.   At a news conference Friday Simon said Washington should waitfor greater political change before easing sanctions even if SouthAfrica's white authorities free Nelson Mandela, the AfricanNational Congress leader who is serving a life prison sentence.   ``One of the ways that dismay will be expressed is throughsanctions, by my country and increasingly by other nations also,''Simon said.   ``We find no pleasure in imposing sanctions. It is not done aspunishment, but as the only clear signal we know how to send thatwe want this great country of yours to also become a just country.''   Simon met with both government and opposition leaders during histour.   He said some blacks he met opposed sanctions, but he said amajority support them. Many Americans who oppose sanctions say theyhurt South African blacks more than the government, and SouthAfrica has made similar arguments.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   Government officials say they are pursuing gradual race reformsand will not be hurried by sanctions.   The sanctions approved by the U.S. Congress in 1986 forbid allnew public and private loans to this nation and bar trade incertain products.</TEXT></DOC>
