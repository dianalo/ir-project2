White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> C LABOR </CO><IN> AUT </IN><DATELINE> HIGHLAND PARK, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chrysler Corp., under fire in Wisconsin for its decision to close its Kenosha, Wis., assembly facility, said it will donate all profits on vehicles it sells in Wisconsin this year to a special trust fund for workers who will lose their jobs.    The move appears aimed at simultaneously fulfilling Chrysler's pledge to help the 5,500 affected workers, and reversing what is becoming a public-relations quagmire for Chrysler in the state. The issue is depressing its sales around Kenosha, in the state's southeastern corner.    Chrysler dealers there are &quot;taking a beating&quot; in the aftermath of the Jan. 27 shutdown announcement, Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said at a news conference in Milwaukee. But he and other Chrysler officials said the unusual move of linking profits to aid for displaced workers isn't an attempt to boost sales.    &quot;If anyone thinks this is a rebate program, forget it,&quot; Mr. Iacocca said. Later, a Chrysler spokesman said the auto maker's sales are currently running higher than last year in Wisconsin as a whole. The spokesman said Chrysler is acting because &quot;we felt it was a moral obligation.&quot;    Chrysler's donation to the &quot;Chrysler-Kenosha Trust&quot; could be as much as $20 million, Mr. Iacocca said. Last year, the company sold about 40,000 cars and trucks in Wisconsin. The company had an average net profit of $506 a vehicle, he said.    The move to soften the blow of the shutdown -- and Mr. Iacocca's decision to fly to Wisconsin to announce the program -- follow nearly three weeks of controversy, which has dogged Chrysler executives everywhere they went.    Mr. Iacocca is scheduled to meet tomorrow in Washington with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson and U.S. Rep. Les Aspin, Kenosha's congressman and chairman of the powerful House Armed Services Committee. Gov. Thompson, who has threatened to sue Chrysler for going back on an alleged commitment to build cars in Kenosha for the next five years, called Mr. Iacocca's action &quot;a good first step. But it's not enough.&quot;    In a statement yesterday, the United Auto Workers union said it &quot;welcomed&quot; Chrysler's effort to &quot;be responsive to the situation.&quot;    While again denying that Chrysler had made a legally binding commitment to Kenosha, Mr. Iacocca conceded the company misjudged the market when it spent $200 million last year refurbishing the turn-of-the-century facility, which once belonged to American Motors Corp. &quot;Blame us for being dumb managers,&quot; Mr. Iacocca said. &quot;But don't call me a liar.&quot;    Mr. Iacocca laid much of the blame for the Kenosha shutdown on foreign competition, specifically Japanese auto makers. &quot;I hope the new president will address the trade imbalance,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I know what I would do if I were president. But I'm not running.&quot;    Chrysler, however, has five assembly plants in Mexico, and last year, 12.3% of the cars it sold in the U.S. were imported from Japan. It maintains the contradiction exists because it must import cars from Japan to be competitive in certain parts of its product line. </TEXT></DOC>
