The problem is that signs of superconductivity -- in which electricity is conducted with practically no loss of energy -- appear only fleetingly and faintly at the higher temperatures. As reports of ambiguous findings multiply, just what counts as proof of a temperature breakthrough in superconductivity is becoming hazy.    A lot is riding on the research. Superconductors -- with their promise of levitated trains and desktop supercomputers -- have long needed costly refrigeration at very low temperatures. A patent for achieving superconductivity at room temperature could be one of the most valuable ever.    The latest superconductors require cooling with liquid nitrogen to manifest their remarkable properties. That's a big advance since previous superconductors worked only at far lower temperatures, achieved with more expensive liquid helium. Still, superconductivity may have to be reached at yet higher temperatures to achieve the promised technological revolution.    Cooling the superconductors with liquid nitrogen probably won't be a major obstacle for many large applications, such as cheaper electric power generation. In such uses, refrigeration would account for a small portion of the project's total cost. But the need to use liquid nitrogen, which boils at about minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit, could stymie consumer uses. &quot;Imagine if you had to come in every morning and pour liquid nitrogen into your personal computer,&quot; says Paul Fleury, who directs physical research at American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell Laboratories.    Scientists are trying variations of the new superconducting materials. But so far, only tiny portions -- often much less than 1% -- of the samples act as superconductors at temperatures above that of liquid nitrogen. The samples usually are unstable, yielding only teasing glimpses of superconductivity.    &quot;We had zero resistance as well as we could measure at 292 Kelvin (66 F),&quot; says Alex Zettl, a researcher at the University of California in Berkeley. But when the sample was heated and recooled, the low resistance disappeared, he says, leaving uncertain whether the effect had been a sign of superconductivity or of materials that can mimic low resistance.    Many researchers hope to confirm superconductivity at higher temperatures by detecting the Meissner effect, which is the repelling of magnetic fields by superconductors. Energy Conversion Devices Inc. of Troy, Mich., recently reported finding signs of the Meissner effect at a torrid 90 F. Only 1% or less of the sample showed the Meissner effect at that temperature, however, the company says. Many scientists, who regard such findings as magnetic glitches not necessarily caused by superconductivity, say both low electrical resistance and the Meissner effect are needed to indicate superconductivity.    Some scientists take an even more conservative approach. &quot;Our tendency is to remain quiet until we have isolated something that is all superconductor, and we know its structure,&quot; says Robert Laudise, director of physical and inorganic chemistry research at Bell Laboratories. &quot;I tell people here, 'Bring me pure glitchite.'&quot;    Despite disagreement over what proof is needed to show superconductivity, researchers concur that purported discoveries of the phenomenon at high temperatures will remain suspect until they are widely replicated.    The recent rash of reports of high-temperature superconductivity annoys some researchers, who feel that publicity-conscious colleagues are breaking the rules by announcing their findings before the results are reviewed by technical journals. That enables a researcher to establish a claim of being the first to make a finding, yet without divulging details that would usually appear in a scientific journal and potentially aid competitors.    At the same time, the pace of superconductor discoveries in recent months has overwhelmed the journals, complicating efforts by scientists to publicize their findings and duplicate colleagues' results. Physics journals &quot;are about two months behind the times,&quot; says Frank Fradin, a research director at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago.    Despite the controversy about recent reports, many scientists believe room-temperature superconductivity is possible. &quot;I think that where there is all this smoke, there is probably some fire,&quot; says Robert Meservey, who leads a superconductivity research group at the National Magnet Laboratory in Cambridge, Mass. &quot;But it's hard to tell how hot it is.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
