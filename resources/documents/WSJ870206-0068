For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Tylan posted a net loss of $4.4 million, compared with a net loss of $767,000 in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell 21% to $6.7 million from $8.4 million. Tylan said the net loss in the quarter included a $525,000 gain from the sale of its Vitre-Graf division.    Tylan, a maker of equipment used in the fabrication of silicon wafers for the semiconductor industry, said the furnace operations accounted for $10.3 million of its fiscal 1986 sales of $28.4 million. The company said it hadn't found a buyer for the line yet, and also that additional writedowns might be necessary. </TEXT></DOC>
