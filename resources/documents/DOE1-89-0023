The geneticbasis for these is investigated in this study by evaluating the scalesof hydrocarbon generation. The treatment also elucidates some major relatedtheoretical topics, such as the numerical relationships in the generationof dispersed hydrocarbons and the accumulation of reserves throughoutthe succession and in individual stratigraphic elements, as well as thequantitative evaluation of how geodynamic conditions affect the basinformation. 24 references.</TEXT></DOC>
