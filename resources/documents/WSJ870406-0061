But the Soviet leader faces a tougher struggle convincing wary foreigners that they can make a profit by helping Russia build communism.    Despite a hard-sell effort by Soviet trade officials, Europeans and Americans remain wary. They know the difficulties that have afflicted Western joint projects in Eastern Europe and China. And they say the Russians have failed to provide the necessary assurances that conditions exist for foreign investment here.    &quot;They're eager, but we aren't,&quot; says one West German experienced in Soviet trade. In a response typical of Western business representatives in Moscow, he adds, &quot;We have questions, but they have no answers. They want to play this by ear and work out each deal on an individual contract basis. This could be chaos.&quot;    The Soviets displayed their eagerness recently when five senior economic officials held an unprecedented news conference aimed at clearing up what they called the Western media's misunderstandings of Soviet joint ventures. Seeking to rebut reports that their invitation to foreign business had been met with extreme caution, Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Kamentsev asserted that of 200 proposals received by the government, 121 were deemed of mutual interest and 12 projects were &quot;practically implemented.&quot; He wouldn't estimate how much foreign capital was involved.    Western diplomats specializing in Soviet foreign trade confirm that several protocols have been signed. But the officials say that no legally binding contracts for joint manufacturing projects have been completed. Among interested U.S. companies are Monsanto Co., for a herbicide plant; Occidental Petroleum Corp., for oil equipment, and Combustion Engineering Inc., for process-control equipment for refineries. The West German publisher Aenne Burda Verlag says it has formed a joint venture involving investments equivalent to $16.5 million to produce a Russian-language edition of its fashion publication.    Officials acknowledge that many of the problems and much of the confusion arise from the broadly worded joint-venture legislation that appeared in Pravda on Jan. 27. Publication of the 4,000-word document, delayed by conservative opposition remaining after the Politburo approved the idea Dec. 25, represented a major ideological shift. It allowed foreign investors for the first time to hold as much as 49% equity and a management role in Soviet industrial facilities.    Westerners negotiating joint ventures say a major sticking point is that the Soviets, intent on boosting their intake of Western currencies, have oriented the law and structure of the projects to increase exports of manufactured goods, while offering only limited access to domestic markets.    &quot;In many cases there's a basic conflict of interest here,&quot; says Prof. Richard Ericson, a Columbia University economist currently in Moscow to study Mr. Gorbachev's economic modernization effort. &quot;Western companies are naturally more interested in tapping the Soviet market.&quot;    Meantime, an internal debate among authorities may give more weight to domestic sales by the joint ventures. Mr. Gorbachev, who wants to upgrade Soviet production quality to international levels, would like to see the joint enterprises compete for customers with state-run organizations, both within the country and on the world market. So said a bevy of Soviet officials who in February showed up for the first time at the yearly symposium of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to tout joint ventures.    &quot;Maybe that's coming, but that clearly isn't what the drafters of the law had in mind,&quot; says Mr. Ericson.    Penetration of the Soviet market by Western firms remains limited, with PepsiCo Inc.'s sale of soft drinks one of the rare examples. Western businessmen say they would like the joint ventures to make goods for the Soviet market that the country currently imports with its scarce hard currency. Noting that Soviet imports of machinery and equipment rose 14% last year in response to Mr. Gorbachev's drive to retool industry, a French machinery manufacturer says: &quot;The replacement of these imports is the best contribution joint ventures could make.&quot;    Keen reservations persist on the issue of distribution of profits and repatriation of the foreign partner's share. The law says net profits are calculated after costs and &quot;payments to the {enterprise's} reserve fund, as well as to other funds . . . earmarked for the development of production and for research and technology.&quot; One Western commercial official comments: &quot;This is too vague. There is no telling how far the skimming will go for things businessmen who are used to market economies wouldn't even suspect exist. We've sought clarification with no avail.&quot;    From the remaining profits the enterprise, after an initial two-year exemption, pays a tax of 30%. After that, the foreign partner receives a percentage of the profits matching its share of the joint venture's capital and is taxed a further 20% of the portion it repatriates.    Compared to tax rates in other countries, &quot;our partners are very privileged,&quot; says Yuriy Aleksandrovich Ivanov, chairman of the Foreign Trade Bank.    Western businessmen say they would agree were they clear -- again, the law is vague -- on whether they'll be permitted to take home ruble profits from domestic sales in the form of hard currency. Prof. Ericson says &quot;it's very unlikely. If the Soviets permit that at the official inflated exchange rate they'll lose a lot of money.&quot;    Mr. Kamentsev skirted the question and would only confirm that &quot;foreign partners could receive profits from all the products produced by the enterprise,&quot; presumably meaning exports and domestically consumed production, but said nothing about profit repatriation.    Western businessmen are also wary of Soviet claims the joint enterprises will be independent from the stultifying control of central planning organs. Prices for local fuel and raw-materials deliveries will be at &quot;world market levels,&quot; the law says, but there is little information on the cost of labor and other pricing issues.    Stressing that &quot;the pricing question must be solved in the nearest future, otherwise it can be a hindrance to the acceleration of joint ventures,&quot; Mr. Kamentsev said trade officials would meet in June to set clear guidelines.    Soviet industry's prospective capitalist business partners are also cautious about what lies in store for them in labor relations and their role in management.    The law says the enterprise chairman and chief executive officer must be Soviet citizens and that the Communist Party and official trade unions will function within joint manufacturing ventures. While the law also says the hiring and firing of workers and payment and incentive schemes are to be worked out jointly, Western businessmen are concerned about the Soviet work force, which Soviet sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, who has risen under Mr. Gorbachev to a position of influence, once described as &quot;endemically lazy&quot; and poorly skilled.    Perhaps more in response to conservative Soviet opposition to Western capitalists operating on Russian soil than to prospective partners' concerns, the head of the joint enterprises department of the Foreign Trade Ministry recently told the press agency Tass that &quot;the agreement provides for the joint administration to stop poor work and indiscipline.&quot; But &quot;a worker can be discharged only if the trade union gives consent.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
