On Saturday morning, the pipes in her attic froze.   ``No coffee, no shower, nothing,'' she said. The single motherpacked up her two children and went to her mother's home, which hadwater.   After an hour, the electricity went out as utilities wereoverloaded by the demand for heat.   Two hours later, the family went shopping to keep warm at a mall.   ``We were there about an hour and all their lights went off,''Ms. Woods said.

On Tuesday, Ms. Woods and her children went home to find herpipes thawed _ and her kitchen and living room flooded because theice had ruptured the pipes.   ``The phone still worked, so I called my mom and said, `Mom,come on over _ I've got water,'' she joked.
