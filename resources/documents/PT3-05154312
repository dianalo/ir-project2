Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is in the field of tanks, principally for underground      fluid storage such as fuel storage, and is particularly directed to      secondary fluid containment to protect against leakage in the region of      tank pipe fittings and connections. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Regulations in many states and of the U.S. federal government currently      require double wall construction for underground fluid storage tanks such      as fuel storage tanks, in order to provide secondary fluid containment      because of environmental considerations. Such double wall tank      construction constitutes, in effect, an inner tank supported within an      outer tank. The inner tank defines the primary, inner chamber which      provides primary containment for fluid being stored, while the space      defined between the inner and outer tanks defines a secondary chamber      which provides for secondary containment of the fluid in the event a leak      should develop through the wall of the inner tank, as for example from      corrosion, a faulty weld, or seismic or other mechanical stressing. One or      more fluid-sensing monitors are conventionally located in communication      with one or more low zones in the secondary chamber between the two tanks,      and any leakage from the inner, primary tank chamber into the secondary      chamber is directed toward one or more of such monitors which then provide      an alarm signal indicating the leakage. </PAR><PAR>  There are several different grades and types of underground storage tanks      generally considered in the art to be of double wall construction which      are currently in use in the United States, and these are almost all of      cylindrical construction and adapted to be layed on their sides      underground, i.e., have their cylindrical axes disposed generally      horizontally. A full double wall tank consisting of two complete      cylindrical tanks, one inside the other, is designated a &quot;double wall&quot;      tank. This type of tank has double end walls and 360.degree. double      cylindrical wall protection. Another type of tank which is not completely      of double wall construction but is nevertheless commonly referred to as a      double wall tank is known as a &quot;wrap tank.&quot; In the wrap tank, the primary      fluid holding tank is cylindrical, with an outer sheet provided which      gives double wall protection for approximately 330.degree. around the      lower part of the tank, leaving the top part of the tank with only the      single wall protection of the primary tank. The wrap tank is utilized with      the consideration that the greatest potential for failure of the primary      tank is in its lower part, with a relatively small potential for failure      at its top. While regulations of some states still allow use of the wrap      tank as a double wall tank, other, more progressive states such as      California require the full double wall tank. </PAR><PAR>  Underground storage tanks for hazardous and flammable materials such as      fuels require access pipe fittings which extend through the top of the      tank from the outside into the primary containment chamber within the      tank, and most of such fittings have function pipes connected thereto      which extend upwardly to surface equipment. Typically for the storage of      fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel, there are at least five such      function fittings required, including a fill fitting, a turbine fitting      for fluid extraction, a fitting for gauging, a vent fitting, and a vapor      recovery fitting. </PAR><PAR>  In a full double wall metal tank, these pipe fittings conventionally extend      through both walls at the top of the tank, being welded or otherwise      bonded to both the outer and inner tanks. While this arrangement      technically has full double wall protection at the fittings, in practice      it has the serious disadvantage that the connections of function pipes to      the fittings, as well as the lengths of such pipes and pipe joints      therein, conventionally have only single wall protection, and therefore do      not fulfill the intent and spirit of current governmental regulations      requiring double wall containment. Such conventional pipe fittings in full      double wall metal tanks have the further disadvantage that the welds      joining the fittings to the inner tank must either be made from the inside      of the inner tank or through an oversize access hole in the outer tank      which then must be filled. </PAR><PAR>  Wrap tanks are metal tanks, and for such tanks the pipe fittings are      conveniently welded into the single wall at the top of the tank. This, of      course, provides only single wall containment at the fittings, and again,      there is only single wall containment where function pipes are connected      to the fittings and along the lengths of such pipes. Accordingly, such      wrap tanks are even further away than the full double wall tanks from      complying with the intent and spirit of current governmental regulations. </PAR><PAR>  Many tanks currently being produced and sold as full double wall tanks are      nonmetallic, as for example having a wound filament fiberglass/resin      construction. The filament winding fabrication process does not permit      fittings to be integrally incorporated in such a double wall nonmetallic      tank when the two walls are being fabricated, and if the fittings were to      be disposed directly through the two walls of the nonmetallic double wall      tank, then it would be necessary to drill holes through the two walls and      bond the fittings to the walls from both the inside and outside, which      would be costly, difficult and unreliable. Therefore, for nonmetallic      double wall tanks the almost universal current procedure is to provide      manway openings, and to provide metal covers for such openings through      which the pipe fittings are welded. Normally only three fittings can be      accommodated in a single manway cover, so that where more than three      fittings are required, which is usually the case, two manways and      associated metal covers with fittings are conventionally provided with      double wall nonmetallic tanks. Such metal manway covers with fittings for      nonmetallic tanks are conventionally of single wall construction, lacking      any double wall containment at the fittings, and again, lacking any double      wall containment where function pipes connect to the fittings or along the      lengths of such pipes. </PAR><PAR>  Applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,585, issued Aug. 11, 1987, teaches the      incorporation of pipe fittings with a pair of spaced covers of a double      wall manway system. While this affords true double wall containment in the      manway and at the fittings, it again does not provide double wall      containment where function pipes connect to the fittings, or along the      lengths of such pipes. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, despite current governmental regulations requiring double wall      containment for underground tanks, many so-called double wall tanks      currently actually provide only single wall protection at pipe fittings      and along the lengths of pipes connected to the fittings, and applicant is      not aware of any prior art system which provides true double wall      containment for all regions associated with a double wall tank, including      the pipe fittings per se, connections of function pipes to the pipe      fittings, and along the lengths of such pipes extending to surface      equipment. </PAR><PAR>  There are currently strong indications from the EPA (U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency) and other regulatory agencies that statistically, in      the field, for underground tanks which are properly installed, whether      double wall or single wall, the failures which occur are at the      connections to the tanks and not in the tanks themselves. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In view of these and other problems in the art, it is an object of the      present invention to provide a tank secondary fluid containment system      which provides complete secondary or double wall protection for access      pipe fittings on the tank. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide a tank secondary fluid      containment system which is equally applicable to both double wall tanks      and single wall tanks for providing secondary or double wall protection      for access pipe fittings and pipe connections on the tank. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide a secondary fluid containment      system for double or single wall tanks which is capable of providing      secondary or double wall containment for function pipes along      substantially their entire lengths, from their connections to access pipe      fittings of the tank all of the way upwardly to surface equipment. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide a secondary fluid containment      system which will complete the double wall containment of an otherwise      full double wall tank, in the region of access pipe fittings of the tank      and pipe connections to such fittings. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide a secondary fluid containment      system for the pipe fittings and pipes associated with a double wall tank      which is equally applicable to double wall tanks of both metal      construction and fiberglass/resin or other nonmetallic construction. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide a tank secondary fluid      containment system for the pipe fittings and pipes of a tank which permits      convenient worker access for servicing of apparatus such as a turbine pump      motor located above one of the fittings. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the invention is to provide a secondary fluid      containment system for double wall tanks wherein part of the secondary      containment is provided within a large, generally tubular riser of any      desired cross-sectional configuration extending upwardly from the tank and      which can have a containment lid at its top, this type of secondary      containment enabling the lower end portions of function pipes to remain      uncovered within the secondary containment riser and where they connect to      the tank pipe fittings, whereby convenient servicing access is enabled      through the riser for servicing the pipes, pipe fittings and associated      equipment. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the invention is to provide a tank secondary fluid      containment system which has shroud or cover means extending collectively      over a plurality of the tank pipe fittings that are generally grouped      together, so as to define a collective secondary containment space within      which the pipe fittings and their respective function pipe connections are      located; with individual secondary containment tubes extending from this      collective shroud or cover means over lower end portions of the respective      function pipes, and if desired extending generally coextensively with the      function pipes, to provide individual secondary containment spaces about      the function pipes. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the invention is to provide a tank secondary fluid      containment system for providing complete secondary double wall      containment in the region of a plurality of the tank pipe fittings, which      is elongated and arranged longitudinally along the top of the tank,      providing secondary containment for a generally longitudinal array of any      desired number of access pipe fittings, as for example at least five pipe      fittings for accommodating a fill function, a turbine extraction function,      a gauging function, a vent function, a vapor recovery function, and others      if desired. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the invention is to provide a tank secondary fluid      containment system which has shroud or cover means extending individually      over each of the tank pipe fittings and at least the lower end portion of      its respective function pipe proximate its connection to the fitting, so      as to define secondary containment space extending from around the pipe      fitting and around at least a lower end portion of the respective function      pipe, and if desired generally coextensively along the length of the      respective function pipe. </PAR><PAR>  A still further object of the invention is to provide a secondary fluid      containment system for double wall tanks which, if desired, enables pipe      access fittings for function pipes to be connected only to the inner of      the two tank walls, without the conventional requirement of fittings being      connected to both the inner and outer tank walls, thereby substantially      simplifying installation of access pipe fittings and enabling them to be      welded entirely from outside of the tank. </PAR><PAR>  A still further object of the invention is to provide a secondary fluid      containment system for double wall tanks wherein all welds and/or resin      bonds required for access pipe fittings and for the secondary containment      structure itself can be conveniently effected from outside of the tank,      thereby substantially simplifying construction. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the invention is to provide a secondary fluid      containment system for double wall tanks wherein a secondary containment      riser may extend down through an aperture in the outer tank wall to the      inner tank wall and be connected and sealed to both the outer and inner      tank walls, with one or a plurality of pipe access fittings and respective      function pipes isolated by the riser from the space between the concentric      tank walls, and with the riser providing the lower portion of the      secondary fluid containment system. </PAR><PAR>  Yet a further object of the invention is to provide a secondary fluid      containment system for double or single wall tanks which can be      conveniently fabricated, at least in part, of plastic materials such as      fiberglass reinforced resin, even for metal tanks including double wall      metal tanks, enabling installation and sealing to be easily accomplished      by the use of resin bonding materials. </PAR><PAR>  The system of the present invention provides complete secondary, double      wall fluid containment for either single wall tanks or double wall tanks      in the regions of access fittings and pipe connections to the fittings,      which are the places most prone to failure. For double wall tanks, the      invention completes the secondary fluid containment which is      conventionally only partially afforded to underground fluid storage tanks      by double wall tank construction. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, one or more of the tank access fittings located      at the top of the tank, and preferably an array of a plurality of these      tank fittings, are surrounded or encompassed by a tubular cover or shroud      which is bonded and sealed to the outside of the tank for either a single      or double wall tank, and for a double wall tank the cover or shroud may be      bonded to both the outer and inner tank walls. The lower portion of this      cover or shroud is preferably in the form of a riser. In some forms of the      invention, the riser is of generally circular cylindrical configuration      and surrounds an array of a plurality of the pipe fittings; while in other      forms of the invention, the riser is of elongated configuration as for      example rectangular in cross-section, and surrounds an elongated array of      the pipe fittings, which can be of any number, as for example at least      five pipe fittings to accommodate the conventional five functions required      for underground service station storage tanks. In one form of the      invention, the secondary containment is applied individually to the pipe      fittings with a circular cylindrical riser surrounding each of the      protected pipe fittings. </PAR><PAR>  In a first form of the invention disclosed herein, a generally horizontal      plate extends across the inside of the riser, being peripherally attached      and sealed to the riser so as to provide a secondary containment space      under the plate between the plate and the tank wall exposed within the      riser. When this form of the invention is applied to a double wall tank in      the manner illustrated herein, the riser may extend down through an      aperture in the outer wall to the inner wall, being bonded to both walls,      so the secondary containment space under the plate will be between the      plate and the inner tank wall. However, if this form of the invention is      applied alternatively to the outer wall of a double wall tank as described      hereinafter, or is applied to a single wall tank, then this secondary      containment space under the plate will be between the plate and the outer      wall or outside of the tank. In this form of the invention, large      apertures through the riser plate are aligned or register with the      respective access pipe fittings, and secondary containment tubes are      attached and sealed to the plate at these apertures. Function pipes      connected to the respective fittings extend upwardly within these      secondary containment tubes, and the secondary containment tubes extend      upwardly in surrounding relationship about at least lower portions of the      function pipes proximate their connections to the fittings, and if      required, all the way to surface equipment, with secondary containment      spaces extending longitudinally between the tubes and function pipes. </PAR><PAR>  In a second form of the invention disclosed herein, the secondary      containment plate of the first form is omitted and is replaced by a high      secondary riser, which may be of fiberglass reinforced resin, which seats      within the primary riser previously described and is peripherally sealed      thereto. Function pipes extending upwardly from the respective access pipe      fittings extend through respective large apertures in the wall of the      secondary riser, and secondary containment tubes extend from the wall of      the secondary riser at these apertures in surrounding relationship over      the respective function pipes, the secondary containment tubes extending      upwardly in surrounding relationship about the function pipes as far as      desired. The large secondary riser may have a removable lid which normally      seals off the secondary containment space within the secondary riser, but      is removable for convenient access to equipment that may be located above      the tank within the secondary riser, such as turbine pump equipment which      is likely to require servicing. </PAR><PAR>  Both circular and elongated configurations of the invention are shown and      described herein, and each of these configurations may employ the      secondary containment plate which spans the inside of the primary riser or      may employ the large secondary riser. Additionally, one form of the      invention shown and described herein combines an elongated riser for an      elongated array of pipe fittings and respective function pipes, with a      circular primary riser and large secondary riser which cover one of the      pipe fittings such as a turbine fitting having equipment which is likely      to require servicing. </PAR><PAR>  In the form of the invention having a single riser for each pipe fitting      and respective function pipe, a secondary containment tube connects      directly to each riser and extends longitudinally about the respective      function pipe as far as required, which may be only a lower portion of the      pipe, or may be to surface equipment. </PAR><PAR>  In each form of the invention shown and described in detail herein, one or      more fluid sensors can be mounted within each fluid containment space so      as to sense a lowermost region therein which is closely proximate the      inner tank wall. By this means, any fluid escaping anywhere within the      secondary containment system will drain down to such lowermost region and      be sensed by the one or more sensors, the sensed information being      transmitted to surface equipment. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing a double wall underground fluid      storage tank having a first form of the invention applied to the top      thereof, this form of the invention being of the type having a circular      riser which is spanned by a secondary containment plate; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a fragmentary top plan view taken on the line 2--2 of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a fragmentary vertical sectional view taken on the radial line      3--3 in FIG 2 showing details of construction of the form of the invention      shown in FIGS. 1 and 2; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a vertical section taken on the diametral line 4--4 in FIG. 2      showing further details of construction of the form of the invention shown      in FIGS. 1-3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is an enlarged fragmentary sectional view taken in the encircled      region of FIG. 3 designated 5; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a vertical sectional view similar to FIG. 3, but looking in the      opposite direction from the 3--3 arrows of FIG. 2, illustrating a second      form of the invention which embodies a large secondary riser; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a perspective view similar to FIG. 1 illustrating a third form of      the invention which has an elongated, rectangular primary riser that      encompasses a generally elongated array of a plurality of pipe fittings      and associated function pipes, the upwardly extending function pipes and      their respective secondary containment tubes not being shown in the small      view of FIG. 7; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a top plan view taken on the line 8--8 in FIG. 7 showing the      riser, secondary containment plate spanning the riser, and access fittings      in the inner tank wall which are seen through respective apertures in the      secondary containment plate; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a fragmentary transverse vertical section taken on the line 9--9      in FIG. 10 which shows internal details of construction of this form of      the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a fragmentary top plan view showing the form of the invention of      FIGS. 7-9, with four of five apertures through the secondary containment      plate having function pipes and surrounding secondary containment tubes,      and the fifth containment plate aperture being covered; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a fragmentary, longitudinal, vertical sectional view of a fourth      form of the invention, which is an elongated, axial form like that shown      in FIGS. 7-10, but with a large secondary riser like the secondary riser      of FIG. 6 fitting within the primary riser and covering the entire      longitudinal array of pipe fittings and lower portions of respective      function pipes; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a fragmentary top plan view, with a small portion of a secondary      containment plate broken away, showing a fifth form of the invention which      combines features of the second form of the invention shown in FIG. 6 and      the third form of the invention shown in FIGS. 7-10, with a longitudinal      array of pipe fittings, a center one of which has turbine pump equipment      associated therewith and is enshrouded by a large secondary riser like      that seen in FIG. 6; and end ones of the pipe fittings covered by      secondary containment plates, with function pipes and surrounding      secondary containment tubes like those seen in the from of the invention      shown in FIGS. 7-10; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a fragmentary longitudinal, vertical section, partly in      elevation, taken on the line 13--13 in FIG. 12; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 is a fragmentary vertical section view, partly in elevation,      showing a sixth form of the invention wherein an individual pipe fitting      and associated function pipe are secondarily contained within an      individual respective riser and secondary containment tube. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION </PAC><PAR>  Although the present invention is equally applicable to both single wall      tanks and double wall tanks, each of the several forms of the present      invention illustrated in the drawings provides secondary or double wall      containment for all of the pipe fittings and associated pipes which      communicate from the outside to the inner, primary chamber of a double      wall underground fluid storage tank. For an underground fuel storage tank,      typically as many as five tank pipe fittings are required: a fill fitting,      a turbine fitting for fluid extraction, a fitting for gauging, a vapor      recovery fitting, and a vent fitting. Such fittings are conventionally of      relatively large diameter, having 4-inch diameter internal threads for      accommodating 4-inch OD piping. Although the forms of the invention      illustrated in FIGS. 1-5 and in FIG. 6 are shown as having three such      fittings and the forms shown in FIGS 7-10 and 11-12 are shown as having      five such fittings, it is to be understood that any desired number of      fittings may be employed which can be conveniently disposed within the      confines of the risers utilized in the various forms of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  While the double wall tanks illustrated in the drawings are shown to be      metal tanks, it is to be understood that the present invention is equally      applicable to conventional nonmetallic double wall tanks. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 1-5 illustrate a first form of the invention which provides access      for three pipelines from the outside of a double wall tank to the inner,      primary chamber of the tank, with full secondary, double wall containment      for the pipelines and tank fittings. However, for convenience of      illustration, only two pipelines are illustrated in FIGS. 1-5, and the      third access fitting is shown plugged and sealed. </PAR><PAR>  The secondary containment system of the invention shown in FIGS. 1-5 is      generally designated 10, and is embodied in the top of a double wall tank      generally designated 12, conventionally of cylindrical configuration,      which is adapted to be layed on its side underground, i.e., with its      cylindrical axis disposed generally horizontally. Double wall tank 12 has      cylindrical body 14 and end closures 15. Double wall tank 12 actually      consists of an outer tank and an inner tank which is closely spaced within      the outer tank, with a double, parallel wall construction in both the      cylindrical body 14 and the end closures 15. The outer tank cylindrical      wall is designated 16, and the inner tank cylindrical wall is designated      18. The inner cylindrical wall 18 of tank 12 defines the inner or primary      chamber 22 of tank 12, while the space between outer and inner cylindrical      walls 16 and 18, respectively, constitutes an outer peripheral or      secondary chamber 22 of tank 12. One or more monitor sensors (not shown)      are provided in a conventional manner in a bottom zone of the outer,      secondary chamber 22 so that any leak from the inner, primary chamber 20      through inner wall 18 or the inner wall part of an end closure 15 will be      detected by such monitor or monitors. </PAR><PAR>  A cylindrical riser is conventionally provided on tanks for providing a      sump within which pipe fittings are contained. Such cylindrical risers are      conventionally attached to only the outer wall of a double wall tank, by      welding for metal tanks, and extend upwardly from the outer tank wall. The      secondary containment system 10 employs such a riser in a novel way. Here,      cylindrical riser 24 extends down through a circular aperture 26 in outer      cylindrical wall 16 and seats flush against the outer surface of inner      cylindrical wall 18. The lower edge 28 of riser 24 is arcuately scalloped      to enable such flush seating against the outer surface of inner      cylindrical wall 18. The outer cylindrical surface of riser 24 is bonded      about its entire periphery to the outside of outer cylindrical wall 16, as      by a weld 30, while the inner cylindrical surface of riser 24 adjacent its      lower edge 28 is bonded about its entire periphery to the outside of inner      cylindrical wall 18, as by a weld 32. The bonds 30 and 32 provide      fluid-tight seals between riser 24 and outer and inner tank walls 16 and      18, respectively. It is to be understood that if the tank walls 16 and 18      were of nonmetallic construction, resin bonding and sealing material would      be employed in place of welds 30 and 32. The top of riser 24 is defined by      a flat annular upper edge 34. </PAR><PAR>  A disk-shaped secondary containment plate 36 fits horizontally inside of      riser 24, and it is peripherally bonded from above to the inner      cylindrical surface of riser 24, as by an annular weld 37 which provides a      fluid-tight seal between plate 36 and riser 24. Secondary containment      plate 36 is preferably flat for fabrication convenience, but it could be      curved, as for example contoured like outer tank wall 16. </PAR><PAR>  A circular array of three regularly spaced holes 38, 40 and 42 is cut      through the inner cylindrical wall 18 of tank 12 to receive three      respective pipe fittings 44, 46 and 48 which are secured and sealed in      place, as by respective welds 50. Riser 24 is generally concentric about      this array of pipe fittings, generally registering with but being somewhat      larger in diameter than the array of pipe fittings. Pipe fittings 44, 46      and 48 are internally threaded, and typically will have a 4-inch ID,      although other sizes may be employed. Two of the three pipe fittings, 44      and 46, are shown to be in use, and the third pipe fitting, 48, is shown      plugged. Thus, downwardly extending pipes 52 and 54 are shown threadedly      engaged in respective pipe fittings 44 and 46. The secondary containment      system of FIGS. 1-5 is shown applied to the pipe fittings 44 and 46 and to      a pair of upwardly extending pipes generally designated 56 and 58 which      are also threadedly connected into the respective pipe fittings 44 and 46.      Pipes 56 and 58 will normally extend to surface equipment for two of the      several functions referred to above. Typically, pipes 56 and 58 will      extend in different directions from within riser 24 as illustrated in      FIGS. 2 and 3. For this purpose, pipes 56 and 58 include respective      upwardly extending sections 60 and 62, respective horizontally extending      sections 64 and 66, and respective elbow sections 68 which connect      upwardly extending section 60 with horizontally extending section 64, and      upwardly extending section 62 with horizontally extending section 66. The      third pipe fitting 48 is seen in FIG. 3, and is sealed off with a threaded      plug 70. </PAR><PAR>  Secondary containment plate 36 has three large, regularly spaced apertures      72, 74 and 76 extending therethrough which are axially aligned or      generally register with the respective pipe fittings 44, 46 and 48, being      considerably larger in diameter than the pipes adapted to be accommodated      by pipe fittings 44, 46 and 48. Thus, where pipe fittings 44, 46 and 48      are typical 4-inch pipe fittings, the apertures 72, 74 and 76 through      secondary containment plate 36 will typically be about 6-10 inches in      diameter. Each of the function pipes which extends upwardly from a      respective pipe fitting extends upwardly through a respective one of the      large apertures 72, 74 and 76, and is surrounded by a respective secondary      containment tube which extends upwardly from plate 36 at a respective one      of the large apertures 72, 74 and 76. Thus, a large secondary containment      tube 78 is connected to plate 36 coaxially of aperture 72 and coaxially      surrounds the upwardly extending pipe 56; while a large secondary      containment tube 80 is attached to plate 36 coaxially of aperture 74 and      coaxially surrounds the upwardly pipe 58. For convenience of installation,      these secondary containment tubes 78 and 80 are shown assembled from      sections, including respective upwardly extending sections 82 and 84, the      lower ends of which seat within respective apertures 72 and 74 which are      bonded to plate 36 by respective annular attachment seals 86 and 88 of a      suitable resin bonding material. The upwardly extending sections 82 and 84      surround respective pipe sections 60 and 62. The assemblies of tubes 78      and 80 also include respective horizontally extending sections 90 and 92      which surround respective pipe sections 64 and 66, and respective elbow      sections 94 and 96 which surround respective elbow sections 68 of pipes 56      and 58. The connections between the sections of each of the secondary      containment tubes 78 and 89 are provided with fluid-tight seals 98. </PAR><PAR>  Secondary containment tubes 78 and 80 may be of fiberglass reinforced resin      construction for light weight and convenience in handling. Although      secondary containment tubes 78 and 80 are shown as being generally rigid,      it is to be understood that they may alternatively be flexible, and if      desired, may be of bellows construction as shown for one of the      alternative secondary containment embodiments illustrated in FIG. 6.      Secondary containment tubes 78 and 80 may be coextensive with the lengths      of respective pipes 56 and 58 that would otherwise be exposed, surrounding      the respective pipes 56 and 58 all of the way to the upper, service ends      of pipes 56 and 58 which may be located above ground. Alternatively, one      or more of the secondary containment tubes may only cover lower end      portions of their respective function pipes where connections would be      most likely to fail. </PAR><PAR>  The large aperture 76 in plate 36 which is coaxially above the pipe fitting      48 sealed by plug 70 is closed off by a cover disk 100, which may also be      of fiberglass reinforced resin construction. Cover disk 100 is sealed to      plate 36 by an annular seal 101 which completes the secondary containment. </PAR><PAR>  It will be seen that with the tank secondary containment system 10 of FIGS.      1-5, every point in the primary fluid system that might be vulnerable to      leakage from corrosion, poor welding, poor sealing, or earth movement      stresses such as those seismically induced, is completely covered by      secondary containment. Thus, the inner, primary chamber 20 of tank 12,      defined in part by inner cylindrical wall 18, is completely covered by an      outer wall which includes outer cylindrical wall 16, except in the region      defined within cylindrical riser 24. Within riser 24, inner cylindrical      wall 18 has primary seals in the form of pipe fittings 44, 46 and 48, and      pipes 56 and 58 and plug 70. In the region of riser 24, inner cylindrical      wall 18 is completely enclosed by secondary containment afforded by      secondary containment plate 36, secondary containment tubes 78 and 80, and      cover disk 100. Similarly, primary containment pipes 56 and 58 are      provided with complete secondary containment coverage by secondary      containment plate 36 at their bases, and along as much of their lengths as      desired by secondary containment tubes 78 and 80. Thus, the secondary      containment spaces are the relatively flat, circular space 102 defined      within the bottom portion of riser 24 between inner tank wall 18 and      secondary containment plate 36 and cover disk 100; and generally annular      secondary containment spaces 104 and 106 respectively between pipe 56 and      secondary containment tube 78 on the one hand, and pipe 58 and secondary      containment tube 80 on the other hand. Any leakage from inner, primary      chamber 20 of tank 10 in the region of riser 24 will be contained within      secondary containment space 102; while any leakage from pipes 56 and 58      will be received in secondary containment spaces 104 or 106 and will drain      down into secondary containment space 102. </PAR><PAR>   While it is preferred that the IDs of secondary containment tubes 78 and      80 be substantially larger than the ODs of the respective pipes 56 and 58      and that tubes 78 and 80 be generally coaxially arranged about the      respective pipes 56 and 58, the important thing is to have the IDs of      tubes 78 and 80 sufficiently larger than the ODs of the respective pipes      56 and 58 to provide flow space so that leakage from either of the pipes      56 or 58 will be conducted down through the respective tube 78 or 80 into      the secondary containment space 102 where it can be sensed. </PAR><PAR>  A sensor generally designated 108 has a body 110 mounted in a small      aperture 112 through plate 36, with suitable fluid-tight sealing. Sensor      108 has a probe 114 which extends down into a low point in secondary      containment space 102 provided by the transverse curvature of inner tank      wall 18. Sensor 108 has an output cable 116, shown broken off within riser      24 in FIG. 4, which leads to surface readout equipment. Sensor 108 may be      of any type well known in the art which is adapted to sense the presence      of liquids such as hydrocarbon fuels contained in tank 10, or their fluid      vapors, or water, or other fluids. If desired, a plurality of sensors like      sensor 108 may be employed. For example, a second sensor 108 may be      provided in the other side of secondary containment space 102 so that both      of the lowermost regions in space 102 can be sensed. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, a fiberglass-reinforced resin coating 118 is applied as a      corrosion deterrent over the entire outside of tank 12, including the      outside of outer cylindrical wall 16, the outer and inner cylindrical      surfaces and the upper edge 34 of riser 24, and the upper surface of      secondary containment plate 36, the coating 118 also preferably welds 30      and 37. Tanks having such a fiberglass reinforced resin coating are      manufactured and sold under the trademark &quot;Plasteel&quot; by Joor      Manufacturing, Inc. of Escondido, Calif. </PAR><PAR>  While the cylindrical riser of FIGS. 1-5 is shown extending substantially      above the top of tank outer cylindrical wall 16, it is to be understood      for the purpose of the present invention, the riser 24 need only extend      upwardly to the level of secondary containment plate 36 to provide the      complete double wall secondary containment described in detail      hereinabove. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 illustrates a second basic form of tank secondary containment      according to the invention, with two embodiments of this basic form being      shown. The tank secondary containment system illustrated in FIG. 6 is      generally designated 10a, and is embodied in the top of a tank similar to      tank 12 shown in FIGS. 1-5. Thus, the tank of FIG. 6 has an outer      cylindrical wall 16a and a concentric inner cylindrical wall 18a with      double wall end closures like the closures 15 of tank 12. Inner      cylindrical tank wall 18a defines inner, primary fluid chamber 20a, while      the outer and inner walls 16 and 18a, respectively, define between them an      outer, secondary fluid chamber 22a within which one or more conventional      sensors are deployed. </PAR><PAR>  A cylindrical riser 24a which, in this form of the invention, may be      considered to be the primary riser, extends downwardly through a mating      circular aperture 26a in outer cylindrical wall 16a, and is attached and      sealed to the outer and inner cylindrical walls 16a and 18a in the same      manner as riser 24 of the form of the invention shown in FIGS. 1-5, as by      respective welds 30a and 32a. In the form of the invention shown in FIG.      6, it is desirable that riser 24a extend substantially above outer      cylindrical wall 16a of tank 10a to an upper edge 34a, for mounting of the      lower end portion of a second riser therein as described below. </PAR><PAR>  Three pipe fittings are mounted in inner tank wall 18a, being regularly      spaced within riser 24a in the same manner as the three pipe fittings in      the first form of the invention shown in FIGS. 1-5. Two of these pipe      fittings are illustrated in FIG. 6, fittings 44a and 46a. Downwardly      extending pipes 52a and 54a are threadedly connected in respective      fittings 44a and 46a. Upwardly extending function pipes generally      designated 56a and 58a are threadedly connected in respective pipe      fittings 44aand 46a, and include respective upwardly extending sections      60a and 62a, respective horizontally extending sections 64a and 66a, and      respective elbow sections 68a. </PAR><PAR>  Fluid sensor 108a has a body 110a which is mounted on a bracket 120 shown      attached to inner cylindrical wall 18a. Sensor 108a includes a downwardly      projecting probe 114a which extends downwardly into a lowermost portion of      the region defined between inner tank wall 18a and cylindrical riser 24a.      Thus, in the axial, vertical sectional view of FIG. 6, probe 114a is shown      in the background below the sectioned center line of inner cylindrical      wall 18a. In the transverse vertical section it would be located in      substantially the same location as probe 114 of sensor 108 as it is      illustrated in FIG. 3. Sensor 108a has output cable 116a which extends to      surface readout equipment. A plurality of the sensors 108a may be      employed. </PAR><PAR>  A flat annular flange or ring 122 is horizontally mounted within      cylindrical riser 24a, being bonded to riser 24a as by weld 124. A      cylindrical secondary riser 126, which may be made of fiberglass      reinforced resin, has its lower end portion nested within primary riser      24a, and extends a considerable distance above primary riser 24a. A      suitable axial length or height for secondary riser 126 is approximately      three feet, while a suitable outer diameter for secondary riser 126 ranges      from about 24 inches to about 48 inches. This provides adequate height for      the secondary containment apparatus described below, and ample width for      servicing of equipment encompassed within risers 24a and 126. An example      of equipment which sometimes requires servicing that is generally located      immediately above the tank is the motor part of a turbine pump for      extracting fuel from the tank. For a secondary riser 126 having an OD of      approximately 40 inches, a primary riser 24a having an OD of approximately      42 inches will be adequate to receive the lower end portion of secondary      riser 126. The lower edge 128 of secondary riser 126 is a flat annular      edge which rests on the upper surface of flange 122. The upper edge 130 of      secondary riser 126 is also a flat annular edge, and provides seating for      a disk-shaped removable lied 132 which may be provided if desired, the lid      132 having a down-turned peripheral flange 134 that is in sealing      engagement with the outer peripheral surface of secondary riser 126      proximate upper edge 130. An external annular seal 136 is provided between      the outside of secondary riser 126 and the upper edge 34a of primary riser      24a. If desired, an internal annular seal 138 may be provided between the      lower end of secondary riser 126 and flange 122, either as an alternative      or a supplement to the external annular seal 136. The sensor output cable      116a extends from the inside to the outside of secondary riser 126 through      a sealed aperture 140, and thence upwardly to surface readout equipment. </PAR><PAR>  The purpose of flange or ring 122 is to assure proper vertical orientation      of secondary riser 126. This purpose may alternatively be served by a      plurality of generally horizontal tabs attached to the inside of primary      riser 24a, which may be used in conjunction with top points on inner tank      wall 18a if desired, to locate the secondary riser 126 in its proper      position. </PAR><PAR>  It is to be noted that the form of the invention shown in FIG. 6 does not      require a secondary containment plate like plate 36 of the form shown in      FIGS. 1-5. In the form of FIG. 6, secondary riser 126 and its sealing lid      132 when used effectively serve the secondary containment function of      plate 36. </PAR><PAR>  Looking at the left-hand side of secondary riser 126 as viewed in FIG. 6, a      large aperture 142 is provided through the wall of secondary riser 126 to      accommodate a bulkhead fitting generally designated 144. Fitting 144      includes a partially externally threaded sleeve 146 which extends through      aperture 142, with internal and external contour washers 148 and 150,      respectively, surrounding sleeve 146 and engaged flush against the      respective inner and outer surfaces of secondary riser 126. Contour      washers 148 and 150 are clamped in sealing engagement against the wall of      secondary riser 126 and the sleeve 146 located in place by inner and outer      nuts 1523 and 154, respectively, threadedly engaged over the threaded      portion of sleeve 146. Alternatively, either one of the nuts 152 and 154      may be an integral external flange on the sleeve 146. </PAR><PAR>  Large diameter accordion tubing 156 is engaged over and spaced about pipe      56a, having a cylindrical end portion 158 that is clamped about an      unthreaded end portion of sleeve 146 by means of a band clamp 160.      Accordion tubing 156 provides good secondary containment for pipe 56a, and      its flexibility makes it particularly easy to install. Accordion tubing      156 may be coextensive with the length of pipe 56a that would otherwise be      exposed, extending upwardly to surface equipment, or it may only cover a      lower portion of pipe 56a. It is to be understood that other flexible      tubing, or generally rigid tubing, may be employed in place of the      accordion tubing 156. </PAR><PAR>  A variation of the secondary containment for the piping is illustrated at      the right-hand side of secondary riser 126 as viewed in FIG. 6. Here, a      large aperture 162 is provided through secondary riser 126, and large      diameter tubing 164, which may be fiberglass reinforced resin, extends      through aperture 162 and is bonded and sealed to secondary riser 126 by      resin bonding and sealing material 166. Tubing 164 surrounds and is spaced      outwardly from pipe 58a, and may either be coextensive with the length of      pipe 58a that would otherwise be exposed, extending to surface equipment,      or may only cover a lower portion of pipe 58a. </PAR><PAR>  Backfill material 168, which may be tamped sand, gravel or the like,      surrounds secondary riser 126 and tubings 156 and 164, and if desired the      material 168 may also fill the secondary riser 126. A concrete slab 170,      such as the typical service station pad, overlies the tank secondary      containment system 10a shown in FIG. 6, and has a servicing manway 162      therethrough which coaxially overlies risers 24a and 126. Typically,      manway 172 will be covered by an &quot;Alhambra&quot; type manway cover like the      sewer covers employed in streets. </PAR><PAR>  The secondary containment spaces in the system 10a of FIG. 6 include the      large secondary containment space 176 within secondary riser 126 and      extending downwardly past the flange 122 and circular aperture 26a in      outer tank wall 16a to inner tank wall 18a; secondary containment space      178 defined between pipe 56a on the inside and sleeve 146 and accordion      tubing 156 on the outside; and secondary containment space 180 defined      between pipe 58a on the inside and tubing 164 on the outside. For some      installations, the secondary containment afforded by secondary riser 126      will be adequate without the lid 132. </PAR><PAR>  Any liquid or gas which might escape from inner, primary chamber 20a      through a pipe fitting 44a or 46a, or any liquid or gas which might escape      from a joint in either of the pipes 56a or 58a, will be retained in the      secondary containment spaces 176, 178, and 180. Escaped liquid will      accumulate in the low region of secondary containment space 176 proximate      probe 114a of sensor 108a, and escaped liquid or gas in this region will      be sensed by sensor 108a. </PAR><PAR>  As with the first form of the invention shown in FIGS. 1-5, it is preferred      to cover the outside of the tank, including outer tank wall 16a, riser      24a, and the upper surface of ring 122 with a fiberglass reinforced resin      coating 182 for protection against corrosion. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 7-10 illustrate another tank secondary containment system according      to the invention which is generally designated 10b, wherein any desired      number of generally longitudinally arranged pipe fittings and      corresponding function pipes may be accommodated by a secondary      containment system of the invention which has a generally elongated      configuration. The tank secondary containment system 10b as illustrated in      FIGS. 7-10 has five pipe fittings and corresponding function pipes, but it      may be made to accommodate a large number, if desired. Five pipe fittings      enable all five conventional service station functions to be employed in      the single secondary containment 10b, including a fill fitting, a turbine      fitting for fluid extraction, a gauge fitting, a vapor recovery fitting,      and a vent fitting. The secondary containment system 10b has an elongated      form which extends longitudinally along the top of the tank generally      coaxial with the longitudinal axis of the tank. This general arrangement      is best seen in FIG. 7, wherein tank 12b is shown with cylindrical body      14b and end closures 15b, secondary containment system 10b extending      longitudinally along the top of cylindrical tank body 14b. </PAR><PAR>  As seen in FIG. 9, tank cylindrical body 14b includes outer cylindrical      wall 16b and concentric inner cylindrical wall 18b, with inner, primary      chamber 20b defined within inner wall 18b, and outer, secondary chamber      22b defined between respective outer and inner walls 16b and 18b. </PAR><PAR>  The form of tank secondary containment system 10b shown in FIGS. 7-10 is      generally the same as the form 10 shown in FIGS. 1-5 except for the      elongated arrangement in the form 10b wherein riser 24b extends      longitudinally along the top of cylindrical tank body 14b, with the pipe      fittings and associated function pipes longitudinally aligned within riser      24b. Riser 24b is shown as rectangular in configuration, with straight      ends, although it is to be understood that it may alternatively be oval in      configuration with curved or arcuate ends. Rectangular riser 24b is      engaged downwardly through a mating rectangular aperture 26b. Riser 24b      includes a pair of elongated, parallel, vertically arranged side walls 184      which have straight lower edges 186 that fit flush against the outer      surface of outer tank wall 16b. The side walls 184 are arranged parallel      to the longitudinal axis of tank cylindrical body 14b. A pair of parallel,      vertically arranged end walls 188 is arranged at right angles to side      walls 184, end walls 188 having arcuate lower edges 190 with the same      radius of curvature of the outer surface of outer tank wall 16b, the lower      edges 186 fitting flush against outer wall 16b. The outer surfaces of      riser 24b are bonded, as by a weld seam 30b, to the outside of outer wall      16b around the entire periphery of riser 24b, weld 30b providing a      fluid-tight seal between riser 24b and outer tank wall 16b. The inner      surfaces of riser 24b proximate its lower edges 186 and 190 are bonded to      the outside of inner tank wall 18b, as by a weld seam 34b which extends      around the entire periphery of riser 24b and provides a fluid-tight seal      between riser 24b and inner tank wall 18b. Riser 28b extends upwardly from      outer wall 16b to an upper edge 34b, providing a sump region within riser      24b. </PAR><PAR>  A flat, rectangular secondary containment plate 36b is complementary in      configuration to the rectangular inside of riser 24b, and is arranged      horizontally within riser 24b. The top of secondary containment plate 36b      is bonded, as by a weld 37b, to the inside of riser 24b around the entire      periphery of plate 36b, weld 37b providing a fluid-tight seal between      plate 36b and riser 24b. </PAR><PAR>  Five regularly longitudinally spaced holes 38b through inner tank wall 18b      accommodate five respective pipe fittings 44b which are secured as by      fluid-tight welds. Riser 24b generally registers with but is somewhat      larger than the array of pipe fittings 44b. A pipe 52b is threadedly      coupled to fitting 44b and extends downwardly into the inner, primary tank      chamber 20b as seen in FIG. 9. Similar downwardly extending pipes 52b may      be threadedly coupled to any of the other pipe fittings 44b. Upwardly      extending function pipes 56b may be threadedly coupled to any of the five      pipe fittings 44b. In FIGS. 9 and 10, four of the upwardly extending      function pipes 56b are threadedly coupled to four respective pipe fittings      44b, and these are shown in FIG. 10 extending in various azimuthal      directions leading to different surface locations. Each of the function      pipes 56b has an upwardly extending section 60b and a horizontally      extending section 64b joined together by an elbow section (not shown),      pipes 56 b being assembled in the same manner as pipes 56 and 58 shown in      FIGS. 1 and 2. The second pipe fitting 44b from the right as viewed in      FIGS. 8 and 10 is shown not to be in use for a function pipe, and is      therefore sealed with a plug 70b. </PAR><PAR>  Five large apertures 72b extend through plate 36b in axial alignment or      generally registering with the respective pipe fittings 44b. Four of these      large apertures 72b have secondary containment tubes 78b fitted and sealed      thereto as best seen in FIG. 9. Secondary containment tubes 78b are of the      same type as secondary containment tubes 78 and 80 shown in FIGS. 1-4,      including upwardly extending sections 82b affixed and sealed to plate      36bat annular attachment seals 86b, horizontally extending sections 90b,      and connecting elbow sections 94b. Seals 98b are provided at the      attachments between the sections of secondary containment tubes 78b. Large      aperture 72b which overlies pipe fitting 44b having plug 70b therein is      sealed off by means of cover disk 100b which is fastened to plate 36b by      an annular seal. </PAR><PAR>  Secondary containment for the system of FIGS. 7-10 is the same as secondary      containment for the system of FIGS. 1-5, except for the elongated      construction of riser 24b and plate 36b and the elongated arrangement of      the pipe fittings 44b and pipes 56b to be contained. Thus, secondary      containment space 102b is defined within riser 24b between its sides 184      and ends 188, inner tank wall 18b, and secondary containment plate 36b;      and secondary containment spaces 104b are defined between each of the      function pipes 56b and its respective surrounding secondary containment      tube 78b. Liquid which might escape from inner, primary chamber 20b      through a pipe fitting 44b, or which might escape from a joint in one of      the function pipes 56b, will drain down to a lowermost zone in the      secondary containment space 102b where it will be sensed by a fluid sensor      108b. Fluid sensor 108b is preferably of the type which will sense either      a liquid fluid or a gaseous fluid that would be the vapor of a liquid      contained in the inner, primary chamber 20b of tank 12b. Where liquid      fuels are to be contained in inner, primary chamber 20b, preferably sensor      108b will be sensitive to the presence of both hydrocarbon liquid and      hydrocarbon gas from the hydrocarbon liquid contained in the inner,      primary chamber 20b. Sensor 108b  includes a body 110b which extends      through an aperture in plate 36b and is sealed to plate 36b, with a probe      114b extending downwardly to a lowermost zone in secondary containment      space 102b and a sensor output cable 116b which extends to surface readout      equipment. A plurality of the sensors 180b may be employed. </PAR><PAR>  As with the other forms of the invention, the form shown in FIGS. 7-10 also      preferably has a corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced coating 118b      covering exposed metal parts, including the outside of outer tank wall      16b, both sides and the upper edge 34b of riser 24b, the upper surface of      plate 36b, and welds 30b and 37b. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 illustrates another form of the present invention which combines      the advantageous features of the form shown in FIG. 6 and the form shown      in FIGS. 7-10. Thus, the embodiment shown in FIG. 11 has the advantage of      a secondary riser providing part of the secondary containment space which      affords convenient access for servicing of pipe fittings, connections and      associated equipment located proximate the top of the tank, while at the      same time enabling an elongated array of pipe fittings and associated      function or service pipes to be arranged along the top of the tank. </PAR><PAR>  The tank secondary containment system illustrated in FIG. 11 is generally      designated 10c, and is embodied at the top of a tank having respective      outer and inner cylindrical walls 16c and 18c. Elongated cylindrical riser      24c is similar to riser 24b of FIGS. 7-10, being disposed down through      rectangular aperture 26c in outer tank wall 16c. The lower edge of riser      24crests flush against the upper surface of inner wall 18c, and riser 24c      is bonded and peripherally sealed to both outer wall 16c and inner wall      18c in the same manner that the riser is bonded to both tank walls in the      form shown in FIGS. 7-10. A flat, horizontal inwardly directed flange 122c      extends peripherally inwardly from rectangular riser 24c, being bonded to      riser 24a as by peripheral weld 124c. Flange 122c is the rectangular      counterpart of flange 122 of FIG. 6, and flange 122c may be replaced by      tabs as described above for the flange 122. </PAR><PAR>  Secondary riser 126c, which may be made of fiberglass reinforced resin, is      tubular with a rectangular horizontal cross-section that is generally      complementary to the inner periphery of primary riser 24c. The lower      portion of secondary riser 126c nests inside primary riser 24c and has its      lower edge 128c seated against the upper surface of flange 122c for proper      vertical orientation of secondary riser 126c. Secondary riser 126c may      extend to an upper edge 130c on the order of about three feet above outer      tank wall 16c. Secondary riser 126c may be covered by a complementary      removable lid 132c which has a down-turned peripheral flange 134c that      seals off the top of secondary riser 126c. External peripheral seal 136c      of suitable resin or other sealing material seals secondary riser 126c to      the upper edge of primary riser 24c around its entire periphery. </PAR><PAR>  Five regularly spaced, aligned pipe fittings 44c are longitudinally      arranged within riser 24c, and five respective function or service pipes      56c are threadedly connected to fittings 44c and extend upwardly and      laterally to surface equipment. Fluid sensor 108c is mounted on a suitable      bracket 120c so as to sense a lowermost location within primary riser 24c,      and sensor cable 116c passes through a sealed aperture 140c in secondary      riser 126c that extends to surface readout equipment. </PAR><PAR>  Five large apertures 162c are provided through the side walls of      rectangular secondary riser 126c, and the five respective function or      service pipes 56c extend through these large apertures 162c. Large      diameter tubing 164c is attached to secondary riser 126c at each of the      apertures 162c by a peripheral bond 166c which serves as a fluid-tight      seal. Each of the tubes 164c surrounds a respective pipe 56c from      secondary riser 126c upwardly to a desired extent, which may be all of the      way to surface equipment if desired. While tubing 164c is illustrated as      the type of tubing illustrated at the right-hand side of FIG. 6, which may      be rigid fiberglass reinforced resin tubing, it is to be understood that      tubing 164c may be flexible, or it may be flexible accordion-type tubing      like the tubing 156 shown at the left-hand side of FIG. 6, which may be      connected to secondary riser 126c by a bulkhead fitting. </PAR><PAR>  The secondary containment system 10c of FIG. 11 will be seen to provide      service access to all of the pipe fittings 44c and associated pipes 56c      and related equipment immediately above the tank simply by temporarily      removing secondary riser lid 132c. With lid 132cin place, full secondary      containment of the five pipe fittings 44c, associated pipes 56c, and any      related equipment is afforded in secondary containment space 176c within      secondary riser 126c, and within secondary containment space 180c between      each of the large diameter tubes 164c and the respective pipe 56c      contained therein. For some installations, the secondary cntainment      afforded by secondary riser 126c will be adequate without the lid 132c. </PAR><PAR>  The form of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 12 and 13 combines the      features of all three forms shown in FIGS. 1-5, FIG. 6, and FIGS. 7-10.      The tank secondary containment system shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 is      generally designated 10d, and it provides the secondary riser-type of      secondary containment of FIG. 6 for one particular pipe fitting and      associated function pipe and related equipment, while it provides the      coaxial tubular-type secondary containment of FIGS. 1-5 for a plurality of      additional pipe fittings and associated pipes, all of the fittings and      pipes being axially aligned along the top of the tank in the manner of the      form shown in FIGS. 7-10. </PAR><PAR>  The secondary containment system 10d of FIGS. 12 and 13 is shown applied to      a double wall tank having outer and inner cylindrical walls 16d and 18d,      respectively. An elongated primary riser axially arranged along the top of      the tank is generally designated 24d, and has three discrete sections, a      central circular cylindrical section 192, and a pair of generally      rectangular sections 194 and 196 extending from central section 192      axially toward opposite ends of the tank. The central ends of the      generally rectangular sections 194 and 196 are defined by portions of the      cylindrical wall of central section 192, the sides of sections 194 and 196      are defined by vertical, parallel, longitudinally arranged side walls      184d, and the outer ends of sections 194 and 196 are defined by transverse      vertical end walls 188d. </PAR><PAR>  Each of the end primary riser sections 194 and 196 has a horizontal      secondary containment plate 36d mounted therein which is peripherally      bonded and sealed at its inner end to central riser section 192, at its      sides to side walls 184d, and at its outer ends to end walls 188d. Two      axially spaced large apertures 72d are provided through each of the      secondary containment plates 36d, although any number of such large      apertures 72d may be provided through each of the plates 36d. Five axially      aligned pipe fittings 44d are mounted in inner tank wall 18d, one of the      fittings 44d being mounted centrally within central cylindrical riser      section 192, and two of the fittings being mounted under and aligned or in      registry with the respective two large apertures 72d through each      secondary containment plate 36d. It is to be understood that if the number      of large apertures 72d through each plate 36d is other than two, there      will be a corresponding respective number of pipe fittings 44d under such      apertures 72d. </PAR><PAR>  Two function pipes 56d are connected to the respective pipe fittings 44d in      each of the generally rectangular end sections 194 and 196 of primary      riser 24d, and a large secondary containment tube 78d surrounds each of      the pipes 56d and is bonded and sealed to its respective secondary      containment plate 36d, secondary containment tubes 78d being arranged and      serving the same function as secondary containment tubes 78 and 80 of      FIGS. 1-5 and 78b of FIGS. 7-10. Thus, a secondary containment space 102d      is defined between each of the two secondary containment plates 36d and      inner tank wall 18d, and secondary containment spaces 104d are defined      between each of the large secondary containment tubes 78dand the      respective pipe 56d which it surrounds. A sensor 108d may be mounted on      each of the two secondary containment plates 36d for sensing at low      regions in the secondary containment spaces 102d. Sensors 108d have cables      116d which extend to surface readout equipment. </PAR><PAR>  A cylindrical secondary riser 126d has its lower annular portion fitted      inside of the central cylindrical section 192 of primary riser 24d, with      its lower edge 128d seated against flange 122d (or alternative tabs)      attached to the inside of primary riser section 192. Cylindrical secondary      riser 126d may be the same as riser 126 shown in FIG. 6 and described in      detail in connection therewith. Secondary riser 126d extends upwardly to      an upper annular edge 130d and may be covered by a removable lid 132d      which seats against upper edge 130d and has a down-turned sealing flange      134d. An external annular peripheral seal 136d is provided between the      outside of secondary riser 126d and cylindrical primary riser section 192. </PAR><PAR>  As indicated above, a turbine pump for fuel extraction is the most likely      equipment on the tank to require servicing. Accordingly, secondary riser      126d with its removable lid 132d  provide convenient access for a workman      to service the external part of a turbine pump generally designated 198      which is fitted to the pipe fitting 44d that is centrally located within      primary riser section 192 and secondary riser 126d. Turbine pump 198 has      an external drive motor 200 with an electric power supply cable 202 which      extends upwardly through a sealed aperture in secondary riser 126d to a      surface connection. A fuel pickup pipe 206 extends downwardly from the      respective pipe fitting 44d, and a turbine impeller drive rod 208 extends      from motor 200 down through pipe 206 to a location near the bottom of the      tank. A fuel delivery pipe 210 extends upwardly from this respective pipe      fitting 44d and through a large aperture (not shown) in the wall of      secondary riser 126d to surface equipment. </PAR><PAR>  The large aperture in the wall of secondary riser 126d through which fuel      delivery pipe 210 extends may correspond to either of the large apertures      142 or 162 of FIG. 6. Outside of secondary riser 126d the pipe 210 is      covered by a secondary containment tube (not shown) corresponding to      either tube 156 or tube 164 of FIG. 6, connected to secondary riser 126d      by a bulkhead fitting like fitting 144 of FIG. 6 or a bond like 166 of      FIG. 6. Thus, for turbine pump 198, there is a large secondary containment      space 176d within secondary riser 126d and primary riser section 192, and      also an elongated secondary containment space between fuel delivery pipe      210 and its covering secondary containment tube. </PAR><PAR>  One or more fluid sensors 108d are bracketed to inner tank wall 18d, or      alternatively to flange 122d, for sensing one or more lowermost regions      within secondary containment space 176d. Each such sensor 108d has a      sensor cable 116d which extends out through a sealed aperture in secondary      riser 126d and thence to surface readout equipment. </PAR><PAR>  The sealed apertures in the wall of secondary riser 126 and through which      sensor cable 116dand the pump power supply cable 202 extend may each be      like the sealed aperture 140 of FIG. 6. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 illustrates a further form of the present invention in which the      secondary containment is applied individually with respect to each of the      access pipe fittings. This type of tank secondary containment system is      generally designated 10e, and is illustrated in FIG. 14 with respect to a      single one of the access pipe fittings. Here the secondary containment      system 10e is shown applied to a double wall tank having concentric outer      and inner cylindrical walls 16e and 18e, respectively. Inner cylindrical      wall 18e defines therein inner, primary tank chamber 20e, while outer      peripheral, secondary chamber 22e is defined in part between outer and      inner walls 16e and 18e, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  As with the other illustrated forms of the invention, access pipe fitting      44e is mounted on inner cylindrical tank wall 18e only, being welded      thereto by an external weld 50e. A pipe 52e is shown downwardly extending      from fitting 44e, and upwardly extending function pipe 56e extends      upwardly from engagement with fitting 44e. </PAR><PAR>  A small cylindrical riser 24e extends downwardly through a circular      aperture 26e in outer tank wall 16e, with the lower edge 28e of riser 24e      slightly contoured so as to seat flush on the outer surface of inner tank      wall 18e. The outside of riser 24e is attached and sealed to the outside      of outer tank wall 16e by a bond 30e; while the inside of riser 24e is      attached and sealed to the outside of inner tank wall 18e by a bond 32e.      Riser 24e has an upper annular edge 34e, riser 24e preferably extending      upwardly from the outer cylindrical tank wall 16e for convenient      attachment of secondary containment tubing to riser 24e. However, riser      24e is preferably relatively short in the axial, vertical direction for      easy access from above for application of the inner bond 32e. Riser 24e      may be made of metal, in which case bonds 30e and 32e may be welds; or      riser 24e may be made of fiberglass reinforced resin, in which case bonds      30e and 32e will be resin bonds. </PAR><PAR>  As with the other forms of the invention, the secondary containment system      10e shown in FIG. 14 permits all bonds to be applied from the outside of      the tank. Most conveniently, the access fitting 44e will be welded by weld      50e to inner tank wall 18e through the circular aperture 26e in outer wall      16e before installation of riser 24e. Then, riser 24e will be inserted      down through aperture 26e and bonded from the outside of the tank to outer      and inner walls 16e and 18e, respectively, by bonds 30e and 32e,      respectively. Riser 24e is coaxial about pipe fitting 44e and pipe 56e,      and is sufficiently larger in diameter than fitting 44e to provide      adequate room for application of both the fitting weld 50e and the riser      bond 52e. </PAR><PAR>  Secondary containment tube 58e, which may be made of fiberglass reinforced      resin, has an enlarged collar fitting 212 formed on its lower end that      fits over the exposed upper end portion of riser 24e and is peripherally      attached and sealed to riser 24e by bond 214, which may be a resin bond.      Secondary containment tube 78e extends upwardly coaxially about and      coextensively with function pipe 56e to surface equipment. </PAR><PAR>  In the form of the invention shown in FIG. 14, the secondary containment      space is generally designated 216, and it is uninterrupted, extending      upwardly, from inner tank wall 18e and fitting 44e at its lower end, being      defined in its lower end portion in the annulus between riser 24e and pipe      56e, and then between secondary containment tube 78e and pipe 56e      coextensively with the lengths of tube 78e and pipe 56e to surface      equipment. It is to be understood that, as with the other forms of the      invention, the secondary containment tubing and function pipe may include      various straight and curved sections as required for directing them to the      desired surface equipment. </PAR><PAR>  A fluid sensor generally designated 108e is located within the annulus      between riser 24e and pipe 56e, for sensing a low point within this      annulus. Sensor 108e may be bracketed to the wall of riser 24e. Sensor      108e has output cable 116e which is shown broken off, but which may extend      upwardly to surface equipment through the space between secondary      containment tube 78e and pipe 56e; or alternatively, may extend out      through a sealed aperture (not shown) in tube 78e and thence externally of      tube 78e to surface equipment. </PAR><PAR>  Fabrication of all forms of the invention shown and described in detail      herein is greatly facilitated by the fact that the structural arrangements      are such that all bonds and seals can be made from outside of the tanks,      and none need be made from within the tanks. Thus, in the form of the      invention shown in FIGS. 1-5, riser 24 is bonded from the outside of tank      12 to inner tank wall 18 by bond 32 and outer tank wall 16 by bond 30, and      the three pipe fittings 44, 46 and 48 are also bonded to inner tank wall      18 from the outside. Then after such bonding is completed, secondary      containment plate 36 is peripherally bonded to riser 24 from the outside      by bond 37. Then secondary containment tubes 78 and 80 are bonded to plate      36, also from the outside. Similarly, in the form of the invention shown      in FIG. 6, riser 24a is bonded from the outside to inner tank 18a by bond      32a and to outer tank 16a by bond 30a, and pipe fittings 44a and 46a are      bonded from the outside to inner tank wall 18a by bonds 50a. Annular      flange or ring 122 is bonded to riser 24a from about by bond 124.      Secondary riser 126 is bonded and sealed to primary riser 24a from above      at upper seal 136, and if desired at lower seal 138. Bulkhead fitting 144      is readily assemblable on secondary riser 126 from above, as is the      connection of accordion tubing 156 to bulkhead fitting 144; and also      tubing 164 is attached and sealed to secondary riser 126 from above.      Similarly, all attachments in the forms of the invention shown in FIGS.      7-10 and 11-14 may be provided or accomplished from above, in the same      manner as those done in the forms of the invention shown in FIGS. 1-5 and      FIG. 6. All of the sensors are arranged to be installed from above. </PAR><PAR>  The secondary containment tubes of the various forms of the invention will      in some cases extend coextensively with their respective function pipes to      surface equipment, where the annulus between each tube and its respective      pipe will normally be sealed. In other cases, the secondary containment      tubes may only be required to extend along lower portions of the function      pipes. In such case, the annulus between each tube and its respective      function pipe will still normally be sealed proximate the upper end of the      tube. In some cases, the upper ends of the secondary containment tubes may      not be required to be sealed. </PAR><PAR>  While the present invention has been shown and described in detail with      respect to circular and rectangular configurations applied to specific      arrays of access pipe fittings, it is to be understood that other      configurations of the invention may be applied to any desired arrays of      fittings within the scope of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  In each of the forms of the invention illustrated herein in connection with      a double wall tank, the primary riser has been shown extending down      through a large aperture in the outer wall to the inner wall and being      bonded to both the outer wall and the inner wall with bonds which provide      peripheral seals. However, the peripheral seal between the riser and the      outer tank wall is the only one that is important to afford secondary      containment. If desired, the riser need not be sealed to the inner tank      wall, in which case liquid leaking from a pipe fitting or connection will      drain from the riser into the outer tank chamber, which is the      interstitial space between the outer and inner tank walls, and be sensed      by sensor means conventionally located in this space. Thus, if desired,      this mode of operation may be deliberately utilized by connecting and      sealing the riser only to the outer tank wall and not bringing the riser      down through the space between the tank to the inner tank wall, leaving      the space around the pipe fitting which are served by the riser open      between the two tank walls. This variation of the invention will still      have the pipe fittings mounted only on the inner tank wall. In all other      respects the system of the invention will be the same as shown and      described in detail above. </PAR><PAR>  Another alternative arrangement of the invention as applied to a double      wall tank is to not have a riser aperture through the outer tank wall, and      to bond and seal the primary riser on the outside of the outer tank wall.      In this case, the pipe fittings within the riser are mounted in and bonded      to both of the tank walls, and can be installed from the outside of the      tank by providing an oversize hole in the outer tank which enables bonding      of the fittings to the inner wall from the outside, and then filling in      the oversize space and bonding the fittings to the outer wall. Again, in      all other respect the system of the invention will be the same as shown      and described in detail above. </PAR><PAR>  The system of the invention may be applied to any single wall tank in the      same way as described in the immediately preceding paragraph for a double      wall tank, the primary riser being bonded and sealed to the outside of the      single wall of the tank. In this case, the pipe fittings within the riser      are mounted in and bonded to the single wall of the tank, which can be      accomplished from the outside of the tank. Again, in all other respects      the system of the invention will be the same as shown and described in      detail above. </PAR><PAR>  While a fiberglass-reinforced coating such as &quot;Plasteel&quot; has been shown on      the forms of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 1-5, 6, and 7-10, but has      not been shown on the forms illustrated in FIGS. 11, 12-13, and 14, it is      to be understood that such an anticorrosion coating is optional, and may      be included or omitted from any of the forms of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  While the present invention has been described with reference to presently      preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that various modifications      or alterations may be made by those skilled in the art without departing      from the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth in the appended      claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
