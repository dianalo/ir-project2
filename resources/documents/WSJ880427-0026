The agency's new position on the plastic gun issue means that Congress is likely to pass a measure to deal with the controversial problem this year. With administration support, the NRA could have been better able to stymie such legislation.    The Justice Department's move follows months of intense debate within the administration, as well as high-powered lobbying and extensive advertising campaigns by the NRA on one side and law enforcement groups on the other.    Attorney General Edwin Meese changed his view, according to law enforcement officials, after determining that the NRA-backed measure he previously supported would be too difficult to police.    The NRA, which fights virtually all government controls on the use and sale of firearms, advocates a bill that, in effect, would have permitted the manufacture and sale of nonmetal guns that could escape detection by the current generation of detectors widely used at airports, courthouses and other public facilities.    Gun control groups and police organizations have been pushing hard for a requirement that all guns contain enough metal so that they will trigger an alarm in detectors. </TEXT></DOC>
