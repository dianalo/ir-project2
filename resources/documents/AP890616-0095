ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court has ruled that MCIforfeited its opportunity to have a multibillion-dollar federaltelecommunications contract reopened because it failed to bid thefirst time.   ``MCI did not act on time to become an interested party withregard to the solicitation,'' the U.S. Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit said Thursday. ``MCI's argument that it is aninterested party must be rejected.''   Last December 7, the General Services Administration awarded thecontract for one network to ATandamp;T and for the other to US Sprint.Losing out was a third bidder, Martin Marietta Corporation, whoseproposal included a substantial share for MCI.   The contracts for the two networks are among the largestnon-military awards by the U.S. Government. They are valued atbetween $3 billion and $10 billion, and they could reach a maximum$25 billion over their 10-year life.   MCI went before the GSA Board of Contract Appeals to challengethe award to ATandamp;T, complaining that GSA, after awarding thecontract, impermissibly waived requirements instead of resolicitingthe contract.   The board rejected the claim in February, saying that MCI _ whichwas to have been a major subcontractor for Martin Marietta _ was notan interested party. MCI had claimed that if the contract wereresolicited it would be a ``prospective bidder'' but the boardrejected that also.   MCI carried the case to the appeals court.   That court agreed with the government that the laws involved donot provide for a prospective bidder after the time has passed forsubmitting proposals.   ``MCI's stated intention to submit a proposal in response to anyresolicitation, and its efforts to secure resolicitation by filing aprotest, can do nothing to creat the necessary interested partystatus,'' said the court.   ``By the close of the proposal period, MCI had placed itselfoutside the boundaries of interested party status ... Nothing laterproven could alter the fact that MCI did not act on time to becomean interested party with regard to the solicitation.''   And, said the court, ``nothing alters the fact that MCI was notan actual or prospective bidder and, therefore, is not an interestedparty.''</TEXT></DOC>
