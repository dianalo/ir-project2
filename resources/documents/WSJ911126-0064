Instead, they will workon a reworded version and send it to their individuallegislatures for final approval.   A worn and tired Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, whohas repeatedly said he would resign if the treaty isn'tsigned, appeared alone Monday before television cameras thathad been set up to record the planned signing ceremony.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The leaders of the republics, to their politicaladvantage, based their decision on the idea that the processshould be continued in {their} parliaments so it would notlook disrespectful toward {the legislatures},&quot; Mr. Gorbachevsaid. He said the desire of the republican officials to&quot;pursue their own political goals&quot; was the cause of thefurther delay. He said he now hopes the treaty can becompleted by next month, warning again of chaos if it isn't.   The Soviet leader repeated his fear that the country is onthe brink of civil war, this time citing increasingly tenserelations between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He also said hehadn't given up on the Ukraine joining the new union.   The treaty provides for an elected president and a centralgovernment stripped of most of its current powers. It wasoriginally to have been signed in August, on the day theunsuccessful coup began.   &quot;Nothing will work if we don't untie this major knot,which is the question of statehood,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said. Butlater he said that even this version of the treaty is so weakthat it might not help the country get back on its feet. &quot;Toomuch is gone as it is. The society has disintegrated to suchan extent, everything is so broken up.&quot;   Seven republics attended the meeting. Azerbaijan, theeighth republic, had been expected to sign, but was unable toattend because of the &quot;extremely tense situation in therepublic.&quot; The leaders of Georgia, Armenia, Moldavia and theUkraine didn't attend -- and hadn't been expected to --because of their declared intention to become independent ofMoscow's rule.   Present at the closed-door meeting with republican leaderswas newly reappointed Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze,as well as Ivan Silayev, Inter-state Economic ManagementCommittee chairman, and the country's new chiefs of thedefense and the KGB.   The biggest roadblock to the union treaty is theindependence mood that has swept the country since the defeatof the August coup attempt. As reflected in the republicanleaders' inability to agree on the treaty, decision-makinghas ground to a standstill, with officials afraid to take anyaction.   Most significantly, the Ukraine vote on independencescheduled for Sunday is predicted to strongly favor breakingaway from the Soviet Union. Among other things, the Ukraine,the country's second wealthiest republic, is planning to setup its own military forces. Its leaders have postponed alldecisions until after the referendum.   While all 12 remaining Soviet republics, including theUkraine, have agreed to an economic treaty, the subsequentfinancial decrees by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to seizecontrol of the central bank and the republic's considerablenatural resources and move ahead with radical economicreforms, has created new doubts about the future of theagreement. For one thing, the other republics didn't have avoice in Mr. Yeltsin's decision.</TEXT></DOC>
