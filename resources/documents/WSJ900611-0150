The Rocky Hill, Conn.-based discount retailer, which hasbeen operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankrupty Codesince April, said it planned to submit a strategic plan thatincludes the store closings to the U.S. Bankruptcy Courtafter clearing the plan with its creditors.</LP><TEXT>   Stephen L. Pistner, a retailing consultant who was broughtin as chief executive of Ames after the bankruptcy filing,said the massive downsizing would cut expenses and reduceoperating losses. In addition, inventory sales from thestores targeted for closing are expected to generate about$180 million in much-needed cash.   Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst with Seidler AmdecSecurities in Los Angeles, said the cash would helpsignificantly. &quot;One of the key issues with dealing with Amesis to buoy the confidence of vendors about the company's cashflow and financial position. It will indicate that they'regoing to have cash flowing in and more cash than vendors hadoriginally expected,&quot; he said.   Ames filed for bankruptcy court protection after somevendors had stopped shipping goods to its stores because Amescouldn't pay for earlier shipments.   The planned closing of 221 stores, located mainly inIllinois, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, willeventually result in 18,000 layoffs. After the closings, Ameswill have 458 stores in 17 states, primarily in theNortheast, and about 32,000 employees, the company said. Thestore closings are set for August and September.   Ames estimated that the stores targeted for closing had anoperating loss of $47.5 million for the fiscal year endedJan. 27. The company reported a net loss of $228 million forthe year. That loss included a restructuring charge of $137million for 74 stores and an extraordinary write-off of $8million for fees related to prepayment of debt.   Ames said reserves for the additional store closings willbe reflected in its first-quarter results, but declined toprovide an estimate.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Amesclosed at $2.375, unchanged.   Mr. Pistner said any additional store closings would haveto be studied on a case-by-case basis. &quot;We really aren'tconcentrating on that now. This is a very important and verybig move. Any other store closings would have to be studiedon an individual basis,&quot; he said.   Ames's troubles largely reflect problems at the Zayrestores it acquired in 1988. Ames paid $800 million for morethan 300 Zayre stores, with hopes of turning the chain aroundby shedding its heavy discounting practice and switching toan &quot;everyday low price&quot; pitch. Ames renamed and spruced upthe Zayre stores but had little success attracting newcustomers, due in part to a sagging economy in the Northeast.   Of the 221 stores to be closed, 37 are Ames stores and 184are former Zayre stores.   Mr. Tashjian described the move as &quot;very quick, deep anddecisive action.&quot; He said, &quot;The fastest way to start to makeheadway in this situation is to cut off some of the deadwood, the marginal stores, and clearly that is what Mr.Pistner has started.&quot; He said Ames must also improve cashflow and regain some of the customers that used to shop inthe original Ames stores.   Mr. Pistner said the plan is a &quot;critical first steptowards our primary goal of leading Ames out of Chapter 11.This downsizing will cut our expenses, reduce operatinglosses, and allow us to focus our efforts on servingcustomers.&quot;   The Ames plan also calls for it to close distributionfacilities in Plant City, Fla., and Worcester, Mass. Uponapproval from the bankruptcy court, Ames said it willcomplete construction of a distribution center in Leesport,Pa., in early 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
