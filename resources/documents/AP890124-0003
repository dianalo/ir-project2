Treasury Department officials tried last week to win support fromCongress for a proposal to tax depositors who put money in federallyinsured institutions, the Post said in its Wednesday editions, evenas President Bush was promising he wouldn't raise taxes.   According to the paper, Treasury officials met secretly withleaders of the House Banking Committee last week and TreasurySecretary Nicholas F. Brady met with Senate Republican leaders onTuesday to discuss the proposal. It would impose a tax of as much as30 cents for every $100 deposited at a federally insuredinstitution, according to the Post's unnamed sources.   The newspaper quoted Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L.William Seidman as saying, ``It's the reverse toaster theory.Instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit,you give them one.''   Earlier, the Sandamp;L industry's largest trade group on Tuesdayrecommended tapping the U.S. Treasury to close insolventinstitutions while slashing the amount contributed by healthy Sandamp;Ls.   The proposal by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, ifadopted, would have the effect of shifting all of the burden forsolving the problems of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.onto taxpayers and freeing the industry from further responsibility.   The group, which plans to present its proposal Thursday at ahearing of the House Budget Committee, wants to create a ResolutionCorporation as a new, independent federal agency.   The Resolution Corporation would be responsible for liquidatingor selling the more than 350 insolvent, but still open, Sandamp;Ls as wellas any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the next threeyears.   It also would take over all of the obligations the FSLIC hasacquired in rescuing institutions in the past. For instance, theFSLIC ``resolved'' the cases of 205 insolvent institutions lastyear, largely by issuing promissory notes and guarantees againstloss. These obligations would be transferred to the ResolutionCorporation.   The Resolution Corporation would raise money by issuing notes,which would be guaranteed by the Treasury. Any money the ResolutionCorporation gets from selling failed Sandamp;Ls to new investors or fromselling the assets would go toward paying off the notes. However,the Treasury would have to pay most of the bill.   In the meantime, a new, industry-funded FSLIC would be created toinsure the deposits of healthy Sandamp;Ls, which would pay an insurancepremium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks totheir fund, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   Banks currently pay 8 cents per $100 in deposits. Since 1985,Sandamp;Ls have been paying a higher fee, 21 cents per $100 in deposits.   Barney R. Beeksma, chairman of the U.S. League, argued that Sandamp;Lsalready have paid $5 billion in extra assessments and can't affordto pay more if they are to build their capital, a key reformadvocated by the League and private analysts.   Capital represents the amount of money put up by an institution'sowners as backing for public deposits. The more capital there is,the greater the cushion against failure and the more incentive theowners have to operate the Sandamp;L safely.   ``We've paid all that we can pay and what we're concerned withnow is creating a viable insurance fund for the future,'' Beeksmasaid in a telephone interview. ``Somebody has to decide whether theywant us to pay the bill for the FSLIC or build our capital to makesure this doesn't happen again. We can't do both.''   He said tapping taxpayer's funds ``is a price for the mistakesthat were made in the past by the Congress, the regulators and thefew in our business that shouldn't have been let in.''   The trade group also is recommending that both the ResolutionCorporation and the new FSLIC should be independent of the FederalHome Loan Bank Board, the regulator of the nation's 3,000 federallyinsured Sandamp;Ls. It said the current system of consolidated Sandamp;Lregulation has not provided the necessary checks and balances.   The league rejected, for now, proposals to merge the insurancefunds for Sandamp;Ls and commercial banks. Beeksma said the issue shouldbe ``re-visited'' by Congress in three years, ``after the furorsubsides.''   Meanwhile, the Treasury Department is finishing its ownrecommendations to President Bush. It hasn't disclosed the plan, butit has said a key principal of its recommendation will be thatfurther industry resources and additional insurance premiums shouldbe tapped before public funds.   Bush, in a meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders, said hewould propose substantial revisions next month to Ronald Reagan'sbudget, including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis.   In another development, Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois, the HouseRepublican leader, announced the creation of a GOP task force torecommend solutions to the Sandamp;L crisis. It will be chaired by Rep.Stan Parris, R-Va., a member of the House Banking Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
