Constitution:A pressure accumulator is used in common as a portion of a high pressureinjection system upon small LOCA rupture while taking notice on the differencefor the required performance of the accumulator and the high pressureinjection pump depending on the kind of primary coolant accidents (degreeof rupture), as well as on that the required injection amount of thehigh pressure injection pump is time dependently reduced along with thedecay of reactor core after-heat. As a result, the capacity for the highpressure injection pump can be reduced at the initial stage of accidentthat requires the injection of a relative large volume of coolants. Thatis, the pressure accumulator disposed for large scale LOCA rupture canalso be utilized effectively to small scale LOCA rupture thereby enablingto use the facility reasonably and reduce the cost. In this way, it ispossible to improve the safety of PWR type reactors and improve the economicalproperty due to the effective utilization of the facility. (Kamimura,M.).</TEXT></DOC>
