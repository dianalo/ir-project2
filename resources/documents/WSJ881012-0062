No company has yet announced itself the victor of the Colombia reserves -- the largest unknown remaining in the Tenneco package -- but people familiar with the auction say the reserves went for roughly $500 million. A Royal Dutch spokesman said he didn't &quot;have any information&quot; on the Tenneco property.    Tenneco hasn't disclosed the identities of winning bidders, leaving each winner to announce its own purchase.    Also unaccounted for is a hodge-podge of international oil reserves, which industry officials say was bought by British Gas PLC, where officials were unavailable to comment. Some industry consultants said Royal Dutch and British Gas haven't stepped forward because they have different disclosure requirements than U.S. companies.    Late yesterday, the winning bidder came forward for Tenneco's 450 gasoline stations. A group led by financier F. Philip Handy, Winter Park, Fla., said it reached an agreement to buy the marketing assets but didn't disclose a price. Industry officials have estimated that the winning bid would be about $170 million. Mr. Handy couldn't be reached, and a Tenneco spokesman said he had no further details on Mr. Handy. There had been speculation that Mr. Handy's group was having trouble proving its ability to finance the acquisition to the Tenneco board, which met yesterday.    After the board meeting, the company said its net proceeds from the sale of its oil company will exceed $6.4 billion, within the range of previous estimates. The company reiterated that it plans to use the proceeds to retire a substantial portion of its huge debt and may buy back some of its shares.    In early trading, Tenneco shares were up as much as $1.125, but apparently the company's failure to offer further restructuring plans frightened off some investors. Tenneco stock finished the day down 62.5 cents a share, closing at $49.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The post-sale Tenneco will have a very different look than the old Tenneco, when oil company sales accounted for almost a quarter of total revenue. At the new Tenneco, farm and construction equipment will account for about a third of sales, based on 1987 results, followed by the company's natural gas pipeline, then shipbuilding, automotive, packaging and chemicals.    Because of the company's new focus and orientation, Tenneco officials have been worrying about how to define their company, and in particular how to market themselves to Wall Street.    With the oil company gone, Tenneco hopes to cut around $30 million a year from its corporate overhead, one insider said. An evaluation program of various corporate functions is already well under way, employees said.    In addition, the company announced yesterday that it will keep its corporate headquarters in Houston, apparently in an effort to dispel rumors that without an oil company, Tenneco had no need to stay here.    The $7.3 billion gross proceeds Tenneco said it fetched for its oil company was higher than many expected, particularly because energy prices tumbled in the months after Tenneco announced the sale. That is one reason major oil companies, which didn't have to worry as much about short-term revenue or production, were the winners of the bidding.    Chevron Corp., which for $2.6 billion walked away with Tenneco's lucrative Gulf of Mexico reserves, will become the biggest producer of natural gas in the U.S. when the sale is completed. Amoco Corp., Mesa Limited Partnership, Atlantic Richfield Corp. and American Petrofina Inc. were also winners of large chunks of oil and natural gas reserves. Tenneco's properties were attractive, the winning bidders all said, in large part because of their undeveloped potential.    Mobil Corp., which agreed to buy Tenneco's Chalmette, La., refinery for $560 million, said the acquisition won't affect operations at Mobil's old Beaumont, Texas, refinery and the company has no plans of closing it or curtailing operations. &quot;We put a lot of money&quot; into the Beaumont refinery, &quot;and we'll put in more money,&quot; a Mobil spokesman said.    But the healthy prices paid by these companies shouldn't signal that future asset sales will be as lucrative. &quot;Tenneco got the hungriest people with the biggest appetites,&quot; said Kerry Thornhill-Cummings, a vice president of the investment banking firm Strevig andamp; Co. in Houston.    Because of low oil prices in the third quarter, she said, the number of reserve acquisitions fell by about 75% from the third quarter, with very few property sales above $10 million.    Crude oil prices declined $4 a barrel during the four-month bidding process. The price drop hurt Joe Foster, head of Tenneco's oil company, who had considered a variety of bids. &quot;I wanted to go for the whole company,&quot; he said, &quot;but financial constraints forced us to go for a couple of packages.&quot;    Mr. Foster led a group that did bid on several packages, proposing a leveraged buy-out. But he said the oil-price drop scared off some of the investors, leaving him to underbid the major oil companies. </TEXT></DOC>
