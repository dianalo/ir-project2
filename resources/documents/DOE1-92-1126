Law and Policy, V. 14, p 97 (1985)) asserted thatinternational law establishes the illegality of nuclear weapons as illegalper se; i.e., that nuclear weapons are not permissible regardless ofuse. The author responds to Fried's essay by making the following argument.First, an analysis of international law and specifically, the law ofwar, shows that nuclear weapons are not, as Fried contends, illegal perse. The law of war addresses itself to the use of weapons during war,rarely prohibiting, under all conditions, the use of specific types ofweapons. In some situations, the use of nuclear weapons may cause lessdestruction and suffering than some conventional weapons, and thereforebetter conforms to the spirit of the law of war. Second, deterrence hasalways been a fundamental aspect of nuclear arms control, but works onlywhen the threat of aggression is backed by stocked and ready arsenals.Finally, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) need not be the comprehensivedefense system Fried portrays; it is, rather, a defensive system aimedat enhancing deterrence policy and as such, it is not only legal, buta necessary element in shaping our policy with the Soviet Union. Theauthor discusses some of the relevant propositions raised by Fried. 45references.</TEXT></DOC>
