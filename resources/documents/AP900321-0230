He goes down easy on ``Keys to the Highway,'' his sixth LP. Buteasy doesn't mean wimpy. Crowell's music is pleasant country pop,yet his lyrics show a man who has earned A's on various tests ofstrength.   Crowell, who's been performing and producing since the 1970s,has hit it big during the past year. His last album, ``Diamonds andamp;Dirt,'' produced five No. 1 country singles. Crowell earned theAcademy of Country Music's new male vocalist award. And just thisFebruary, he won a Grammy and was nominated for five Country MusicAwards.   ``Keys to the Highway'' isn't as full of gems as ``Diamonds andamp;Dirt,'' but it has plenty of treasure.   ``My Past Is Present'' opens the album with toe-tappin',knee-slappin' swing. ``Tell Me the Truth,'' ``We Gotta Go onMeeting Like This'' and ``If Looks Could Kill'' also would pleasethe two-steppin' set. The latter tune, like several others,contains standard country melodies. In this case, it's a piano linethat sounds like it's going up and down, up and down the melodystaircase.   Despite the upbeat cuts, this record ain't a hoedown. Keepingwith country tradition, Crowell gets gritty and personal. ``I'veseen my troubles smoking down on the tracks, my nose all bloodied,taste of salt in my tears,'' he sings on the LP's cornerstone,``The Faith Is Mine.''   That faith helped Crowell cope with his father's death. ``ThingsI Wish I'd Said'' is a tender ode to James Crowell. It might havebeen a maudlin tear-jerker in another country artist's mouth, butCrowell sounds sincere and sturdy.   His personal touch also comes through on ``Now That We'reAlone.'' Crowell's female fans would say, yeah, let's snuggle _ butthere's his wife, Rosanne Cash, warbling unobtrusively in thebackground. She also lends vocals on other tracks.   This time, however, Crowell is out of the Johnny Cash-CarterFamily shadow. He's proved himself a major country artist in hisown right.   _ By Giselle Price, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><TEXT>      ``Flood'' (Elektra) _ They Might Be Giants      Pop music, like most everything else, takes itself tooseriously, which is why we need bands like They Might Be Giants.   Their first major-label album, ``Flood,'' has been criticizedfor not being trenchant. That alone justifies its existence; arecord that isn't trenchant can't be all bad.   On ``Flood,'' They Might Be Giants _ singer-songwriters JohnFlansburgh and John Linnell _ have given us 19 songs that are partSpike Jones and part ``Pet Sounds.'' The music never stays in oneplace long enough to become dull, and often it's quite catchy.   ``Birdhouse in Your Soul'' has a fine rock 'n' roll kick;``Twisting'' is the best surfing music yet this decade; and``Someone Keeps Moving My Chair'' offers not one, not two, butthree great hooks. Also memorable are a couple of 30-second cuts _the quasi-ponderous opening fanfare that announces the album, and adepartment store jingle that includes a cracking whip and threewords: ``Minimum wage, heeyah!''   Other lyrics stand out as well, and at least one can be citedwithout giving away the plot: ``Everybody wants prostheticforeheads on their real heads.''   Sure, it's silly stuff. ``Flood'' is filled with musical jokesthat perhaps would stick to the ribs, rather than just tickle them,if they were motivated by a point of view rather than simply adesire for laughs. But within the realm of silly music, some of thesocially conscious pap found these days in the Top 40 makes``Flood'' sound awfully good.   _ By Steven Wine, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
