Manuel Noriega's regime in Panama.    The rules will carry out the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which President Reagan invoked as part of the U.S. effort to drive Gen. Noriega from power. Among other provisions, the emergency act froze Panamanian government assets in the U.S. and prohibited Panama-based subsidiaries of U.S. companies, U.S. parent companies and individuals from paying taxes and fees to the Noreiga government.    &quot;Exempting small items doesn't keep Noriega alive,&quot; said a U.S. official, who added that the regulations won't represent a softening of policy since the emergency act was invoked earlier this month. &quot;It will allow American companies and individuals -- should they choose to stay -- to hang on.    Still, despite official insistence that the policy isn't being relaxed, announcement of the exemptions may be seen as a weakening of U.S. resolve to use economic sanctions to drive Gen. Noriega from power quickly. Gen. Noriega is as determined as ever to remain in control, and U.S. officials are groping for new ways to persuade him to leave.    It hasn't been decided what exemptions will be included in the rules, which could be released as early as this week. An administration official said American individuals and businesses might be allowed to pay such things as departure and landing fees, telephone and utility bills, excise taxes or garbage pickup fees to the government. Income taxes won't be exempted. </TEXT></DOC>
