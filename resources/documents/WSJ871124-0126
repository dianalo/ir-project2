Mr. Shamir, who left the U.S. yesterday after a weeklong visit, said the success of Arab moderates at this month's summit in Amman, Jordan, in persuading Syria to join a resolution against Iran is a &quot;great success&quot; for the U.S. Unlike some analysts in this country who argue that America's high-profile military presence in the gulf is opening opportunities for the Soviets, Mr. Shamir said, &quot;I don't see these Soviet gains.&quot; Instead, he said, Saudi Arabia and other gulf sheikdoms are increasingly dependent on the U.S. as their sole protector.    If the Arab summit's actions were a success for the U.S., they were a mixed blessing for Israel, he said. Reintegration of Egypt into the Arab world, another result of the Amman summit, removes what the prime minister called an &quot;excuse&quot; for Egypt to stall warming relations with Israel. &quot;In the past, when we complain about no progress with Israel on normalizing relations, the excuse has always been that the priority is on warming relations with the other Arabs,&quot; Mr. Shamir said. &quot;This reason doesn't exist anymore.&quot;    Indeed, in recent days, most of the Arab world, including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, has restored diplomatic relations with Cairo after nearly a decade of isolation for its peace treaty with Israel. All of this almost certainly will mean additional financial aid to Egypt, which Mr. Shamir said Israel favors. &quot;If it eases Egypt's difficulties, it is important,&quot; he said.    However, the apparent rapprochement between Iraq and Syria, the other major accomplishment of the Amman summit, is viewed with concern by the Israeli leader. &quot;It isn't good for us,&quot; he said simply. &quot;As long as we are surrounded by enemies, it is better for us if they don't get along.&quot;    While Iraq and Syria, bitter enemies for nearly a decade, apparently have stopped their public attacks on each other since the summit, it isn't yet clear if Syria intends to terminate its support for Iran in the Iraq-Iran war. That support has earned impoverished Syria a steady supply of oil from Iran and allowed it to squeeze money from Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations by offering to intercede on their behalf with Iran.    Another summit result that pleased the Israeli leader was the isolation and near-humiliation of Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. &quot;No one paid attention to Arafat,&quot; he noted.    But what seems to be giving Mr. Shamir the most comfort these days is a message he picked up on his U.S. trip. He is now confident that Washington doesn't intend to press at the Dec. 7 superpower summit for an international peace conference on the Mideast with the Soviets as a major partner in the talks. &quot;They {the superpowers} have so many problems to solve,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think they will come to our conflict.&quot;    Mr. Shamir, whom President Reagan initially refused to see on this visit in what was seen as American pressure on him to soften his opposition to the international peace conference, remains adamantly opposed to such a meeting. His coalition partner, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, is enthusiastically pressing for one. Mr. Shamir, who was granted a brief meeting with President Reagan, said he had long, friendly talks with George Shultz. While he didn't disclose the content of those talks, he seemed reassured his view is prevailing -- at least for the moment.    The prime minister believes that with the PLO in disgrace, the moment has come for face-to-face talks between Israel and Jordan on how to resolve the problem of Palestinians living on the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza. An international peace conference with all parties, including the Soviets and Americans in attendance, he said, would lead to a &quot;competition between the U.S. and the Soviets for the affection of the Arabs&quot; and Israel's preference would get swamped in such a competition.    Mr. Shamir expressed one concern about the superpower summit: that the U.S. not yield to Moscow on regional disputes, economic assistance or technology without getting concessions in return. &quot;All this is leverage for the freedom of human rights and Jewish emigration,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
