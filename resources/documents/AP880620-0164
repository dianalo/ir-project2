(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With streams running near record low levelsand reservoirs beginning to dry up, an emergency task force ofMontana water users complained Monday that state officialssquandered preparation time for a drought they should have seencoming.   ``Once again, we end up waiting until our backs are up against awall,'' Drought Task Force Chairman George Ochenski said.   The state advisory board of water users, including farmers,ranchers, fishing guides and outfitters, called on the governmentMonday to begin a series of town meetings across Montana to informthe public and to encourage water conservation.   Ochenski and other task force members said they felt stateofficials have been reluctant to plan for drought and promoteconservation efforts, ignoring earlier recommendations for anaggressive approach.   ``It seems to me that it's time to tell them, `Hey, we told youso,''' said Richard Parks of the Fishing and Floating OutfittersAssociation.   Meanwhile, the drought is burning up some of Montana's primecropland. The Bureau of Reclamation says three of its irrigationreservoirs in Montana could go dry this summer, two of them byearly August.   Crop moisture levels are so low in some areas of the state thatabove-average precipitation would be needed simply to salvagecrops. Gov. Ted Schwinden has asked that 22 of the state's 56counties be declared drought disaster areas.   But state Agriculture Director Keith Kelly, who is not a memberof the task force, later disputed the urgency of the call forconservation. He said most farmers in Montana rely on snow andrain, not irrigation, for crops. He questioned how effective waterconservation efforts would be for those farmers.   ``We get our water from Mother Nature,'' he said. ``If shetreats us right, we do well. This year, she didn't treat us sowell.''   Low snowpack last year also lowered stream flows substantiallyand put Montana on the verge of a devastating drought. But heavysummer rains made 1987 a bumper year.   ``We always hope for rain, and we've been saved by rain manytimes,'' said Lt. Gov. Gordon McOmber. But, he added, even rainsthis month won't save crops in many areas, just ``stop theblowing.''   In the ``Golden Triangle'' wheat-producing region in northcentral Montana, Kelly added, ``six inches of rain will do you nogood now.''   Crops also have been damaged in northeastern Montana, which hasbaked under record 100-degree temperatures while precipitation hasbeen about 15 to 30 percent of normal. June usually is the rainiestmonth of the year.   Kelly noted that many parts of the state are in the fifth orsixth year of drought.   Montana farmers and ranchers are used to living through thesecycles, McOmber said. ``We haven't thrown in the towel yet.Montana's `next-year' country.''</TEXT></DOC>
