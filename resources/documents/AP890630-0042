At least 12 people were injured.   About 3,000 riot troopers opened locked iron gates with cuttersand charged into Hanyang University in eastern Seoul. They hadlocked the gates to keep more students from attending the rally.   Riot police with shields and five armored vehicles fired hundredsof tear gas shells over the hilly campus. They easily overpoweredand arrested hundreds of students who brandished steel bars, clubsand firebombs to stop the police attack.   There were no immediate reports on how many people were arrested.Witnesses said at least 12 people were injured, including a femalestudent who fell from a 15-foot wall during earlier clashes aroundthe school gates.   Many of the estimated 4,000 students at the protest fled intoschool buildings or grappled over walls to nearby residential areas.   Riot troopers smashed windows and charged into some schoolbuildings to pursue the students. They kicked and punched some ofthem, tore down protest banners and smashed desks.   Some protesters hurled rocks from the top of school building asriot troopers raced down the school's roads with their arrestedcolleagues.   The students from Seoul and other cities said they want to marchto Pyongyang, the capital of communist North Korea, for aninternational youth festival July 1-8.   South Korea has banned participation in the festival, a sportsand cultural event mainly attended by non-aligned and communistnations. Government officials have accused the north of using thefestival to stir up radical movements in South Korea.   Newspapers in Seoul reported North Korea had opened its bordercrossings to allow entry.   However, about 6,000 riot police patrolled checkpoints leading tothe north, and 4,000 more fanned out at schools, intersections andgovernment buildings in downtown Seoul, according to police.   In addition, U.S. troops guard the southern side of a jointsecurity area around the border truce village of Panmunjom.   Pro-Western South Korea separated from North Korea at the end ofWorld War II.   They fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. They aretechnically still at war because no peace treaty was signed, andmore than 1 million heavily armed soldiers face each other acrossthe 150-mile border.   About 43,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a1954 mutual defense treaty.   At today's rally, students placed one banner showing a man andwoman, clenched fists in the air, walking across mountains fromSouth to North Korea. Another banner showed small people with ropesyanking a towering Uncle Sam to the ground.   Radicals, a small but vocal minority, say President Roh Tae-wooand the United States are keeping the Korean peninsula divided. Theydemand the overthrow of Roh's government and the expulsion of U.S.troops.</TEXT></DOC>
