(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man accused of killing his ex-wifewhile he was on an eight-hour prison leave went on trial Monday ina case that forced the governor to overhaul the prison furloughprogram.   Jury selection began for Alan Lehman Matheney, 39, who wasserving an eight-year sentence for assaulting his former wife, LisaMarie Bianco, on the day he allegedly chased her from her home andclubbed her to death.   Although a gag order prevents comments by the prosecution anddefense, Matheney's lead attorney, Scott L. King, has suggested hewill argue that his client was insane.   Prosecutors say Ms. Bianco, 29, fled her home in terror on March4, 1989, pursued by a man with a .410-gauge shotgun to a neighbor'sclosed front door.   There, her assailant clubbed her to the ground and, holding theshotgun barrel in both hands, he struck her at least 15 more times,shattering the wooden stock, authorities said. She died of a brokenskull.   Ms. Bianco's daughters, then ages 6 and 10, were at home whenthe attack occurred and may be called to testify.   Matheney surrendered to police later that afternoon, around thetime his furlough from a central Indiana prison was to expire.   Ms. Bianco, who had served as a counselor to battered women, wasmourned at her furneral by the women she had counseled. They saidshe had emerged from a broken and violent relationship with newcourage and compassion _ and still lost.   Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat mindful of national Republicans' useof prison furloughs as a presidential political issue, immediatelysuspended the state's furlough program and ordered an investigation.   Bayh, who urged the prosecution to seek the death penalty, latertightened restrictions in the Indiana prison furlough system toblock the release of prisoners under similar circumstances.   Attorneys at Matheney's 1987 sentencing described the marriageas an obsessive relationship of love and hate. Ms. Bianco yearnedto be free of him.   ``If only I could get him put away for a year, I could put mylife back together again,'' she said at one point.   Only days before her death, though, she admitted to friendsthat, although she could never again live with Matheney, she stillloved him.   Matheney allegedly made threatening telephone calls even fromprison. She asked authorities to inform her upon his release,fearing his freedom would eventually cost her her life.   Matheney and Bianco divorced in 1985, ending their seven-yearmarriage but not their hostilities. In May 1987, Matheney wasconvicted of criminal confinement after he disappeared for sixweeks with their daughters, Brooke and Nicole.   The judge accused Matheney of using the children, then 6 and 2,as pawns in an unsuccessful custody battle. He was sentenced to twoyears in prison.   Three months later, Matheney pleaded guilty to assaulting Ms.Bianco at his home. Rape and confinement charges were dropped inexchange for the guilty plea, but Matheney blamed her for theunexpectedly stiff eight-year sentence.   Guards at his minimum- to medium-security prison near Pendletoncalled Matheney a well-behaved inmate, but during the six weeksbefore Ms. Bianco's death, he was refused a furlough six times.   Finally, on March 4, he was released into the custody of hismother, Martha Matheney, and told not to leave central Indiana. Ms.Bianco was not told of his release.   Despite the travel order, the Matheneys drove north to the homeof a friend, authorities said. There, Matheney got the shotgun andheaded for Ms. Bianco's home to retrieve audiotapes he believed shehad recorded of their phone conversations, authorities said.   Matheney said he couldn't explain why he carried the shotgun andrefused to answer when asked whether he had killed Ms. Bianco. Hewould only say that her death resulted from an argument that gotout of hand.   The trial is expected to last at least two weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
