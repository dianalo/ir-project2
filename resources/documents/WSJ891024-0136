With ballots from most of the state's major cities in by yesterday morning, the Republicans came away with 10% of the vote in several of the key districts.    With many rural districts yet to report ballots, election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage points statewide. The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results.    Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric, the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin, Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia.    With West German unemployment remaining high at two million jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for next year's campaign, the Republicans are seen drawing support for their &quot;Germans First&quot; stand on social-welfare issues.    Election analysts acknowledge that a &quot;Red-Green&quot; coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread. </TEXT></DOC>
