Wastepaper generated in such buildings is of particular interest for recyclingas it is produced in sufficiently large amounts, and contains large amountsof high-grade waste paper which obtain good prices from paper mills.The key to successful recovery of such paper is separation, at the sourceof waste generation, from other less-valuable papers and non-paper materials.In recommending ways to do this, the manual covers assessment of theviability of a collection program in a particular building, estimatingthe quantities of waste generated, calculating storage space necessary,marketing the paper collected, using proper collection and storage containers,promoting employee awareness, and administering and monitoring the program.A sample cost-benefit analysis is given for a general office buildingwith 1,000 employees. Includes glossary. 14 refs., 10 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
