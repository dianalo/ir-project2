The 71 Eastbay members of Cemetery Workers and Greens AttendantsLocal 265 approved the pact Thursday and were scheduled to returnto work today, union officials said.   The settlement does not affect a strike by workers at ninecemeteries on the San Francisco Peninsula who also walked off thejob May 30. There are no talks scheduled in that dispute, whichinvolves about 87 workers.   No details of the Eastbay settlement were immediately available.The major issue that prompted the strike was the cemetery owners'use of contract workers to do jobs that Local 265 officials saidshould be performed by union members.   The striking workers included gravediggers, gardeners andmaintenance personnel.   Cemetery owners attorney John Cantwell said he was unsure howmany burials have been delayed by the strike.
