The 400-room Marriott Hotel, which employs 300 people, was about42 perce Tuesday when Panamanian military troopscame to the facility, according to Roger Conner, a spokesman forBetent occupied lathesda, Md.-based Marriott.   Although Conner said details were sketchy, it was hisunderstanding that ``Panamanian military forces had come into ourhotel and seized an undetermined amount of people.'' He said ahandful of journalists, as well as several employees, were takenfrom the hotel early this morning by Panamanian troops.   The remainder of the guests were accommodated in the hotelballroom, Conner said.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said U.S. forces in Panama wereaware of hostages taken from the Marriott Hotel and that someAmericans were still at liberty in the building.   ``We will make efforts to take care of that,'' said Williams.But he declined to say whether American troops were moving guests in asituation that was ``just like when an earthquake hits ... Everyonemakes do.''   ``Operations are not normal,'' he said, but he did not think thehotel guests were under guard by Panamanian military officials.   The hotel's general manager, Sapinder Palta, was at a meeting inFort Lauderdale, Fla., today but had been in touch with the hotelby telephone, Conner said. Other hotel officials, includingMarriott Hotels President Bill Tiesel, were trying to get throughto the hotel, but having little success, Conner said.   But the hotel officials had been in touch with the U.S.government. ``From Marriott's standpoint, we are taking everyeffort to have the U.S. military troops secure the hotel so thatguests can be protected,'' he said.   The hotel, the Panama Marriott Caesar Park, is owned by AokiConstruction Inc., a Japanese company, but it is managed byMarriott. Opened in 1982, the hotel is adjacent to the AtlapaConvention Center five minutes from the banking center of PanamaCity.   At the time of the U.S. invasion of Panama, most of the guestswere journalists and airline crews, Conner said. There were fewbusinessmen in the hotel, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
