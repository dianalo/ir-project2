British coal is competitive with nuclear energy, oil and importedcoal and its cost has fallen in recent years. The full use of modernmining equipment will increase productivity and reduce costs further.In terms of the balance of trade, coal is an indigenous resource, whereasuranium is imported and Britain is likely to have to increase its importsof oil in the future. PWR nuclear technology is also imported whereasBritish mining technology is exported throughout the world. In termsof jobs, the British mining machinery supply industry employs 50,000people, many of them in areas of high unemployment. If the industry declines,so too will employment. The case for coal based on pollution and safetyrests on the fact that emissions from coal-fired power stations can bedealt with by known technology at known cost, whereas the increased needto improve safety will increase the cost of nuclear power.</TEXT></DOC>
