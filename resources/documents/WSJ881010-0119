The &quot;competitiveness&quot; pundits are already gnashing their teeth over what a headline in Business Week described as this &quot;perilous cutback in research spending.&quot;    But realists know that these aggregate Randamp;D numbers are as meaningful as gross sales figures without a hint as to cash flow or profitability; you know there's a business there -- you just don't know if it's making any money. &quot;What people are hoping is that Randamp;D spending is some measure of competitiveness when, in fact, it's only an input measure,&quot; asserts McKinsey andamp; Co.'s Richard Foster, who oversees the consulting firm's extensive technology practice. &quot;The whole notion of inferring competitiveness out of lump sums is flawed.&quot;    Yet that is precisely what most companies do. Top managements and their research staffs describe their solemn commitment to innovation with phrases such as &quot;Randamp;D as a percentage of sales&quot; and &quot;Randamp;D spending per employee.&quot; A top executive of one semiconductor firm boasted at a meeting a few years ago that Randamp;D expenditures as a percentage of sales at his company continued to rise in the teeth of an industry recession. Of course they did: The company's sales had plummeted!    More relevant than any precise accounting for Randamp;D expenditures are the following questions: What does research and development really mean to the enterprise, regardless of the dollars invested? How are the organization's priorities reflected in its innovation infrastructure? What signal, if any, does the investment in that innovation infrastructure send to the rest of the organization?    The notion of research and development as an assembly line that delivers spanking new product ideas and innovations suitable for manufacture and marketing is outmoded and dangerous. And in disciplines ranging from biotechnology to computer software to financial technology, the line between theoretical and applied research is vanishing: A clever differential equation can quickly become the soul of a new security; the discovery of a new enzyme can lead to the creation of a new diagnostic tool. Some organizations have historically done basic research without development -- Bell Labs is a classic example -- and others develop products and services without research -- MCI, for one.    Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield andamp; Byers venture capitalist John Doerr -- whose capital played a large part in the hyperfast growth of such companies as Compaq Computer and Sun Microsystems -- says that output is the best way to measure the effectiveness of research and development expenditure. In this bottom-line context, output doesn't mean patents or published papers; it means products. &quot;New items on the price list is the crispest way to go,&quot; says Mr. Doerr. &quot;What percent of sales revenues come from products less than 'x-months' old.&quot; 3M, for example, is well-known for insisting that new products account for a significant percentage of divisional sales.    But, like measuring Randamp;D as a percent of sales, there's more to organizational innovation than a clutch of new products. &quot;There may be a new role for corporate research,&quot; says John Seely Brown, who oversees Xerox's large and diverse research portfolio. &quot;Research and development has to start looking inward and figure out how it can help the organization better cope with accelerating change.&quot; In the last two years, says Mr. Brown, the research portfolio of Xerox's influential Palo Alto Research Center has changed more than 50%. &quot;We're getting out of things that can be done elsewhere,&quot; Mr. Brown says.    Instead, Xerox is now re-orienting along lines of &quot;sustaining&quot; research and development for its ongoing product lines (such as photocopiers), and &quot;pioneering&quot; research and development (as in fields such as computational linguistics, which would let computers process language in more effective ways). These new demarcation lines between sustaining and pioneering research send a signal to the organization about Xerox's priorities and its focus -- signals that otherwise would be ignored in the crush of everyday crises.    Similarly, Xerox and other technology companies are growing much more sensitive about the distinction between &quot;new-product research&quot; and &quot;process research.&quot; The need for new-product research is obvious; unless the company believes that imitations are the surest form of profitability, it can't afford to diminish the search for new products. But too few realize the importance of process research, designed to give the company a new set of tools and techniques to improve its internal processes. To invest in new products without investing in new processes will hollow out the organization.    The lump sum agglutinations of the traditional Randamp;D budget obscure these fundamental differences in emphasis. However, organizations are becoming more aware of the need to link process Randamp;D with new-product Randamp;D. That's the only way companies will be able to maintain a technical edge within practical economics.    &quot;We've gone to tremendous lengths to make that link,&quot; says Ralph Gomory, vice president of research and advanced technology for IBM. &quot;It's not a spontaneously occurring thing -- {in this respect} mechanisms are more important than measures.&quot;    In recent years, IBM has created some 18 special groups throughout the company that link researchers with developers. Mr. Gomory has been particularly pleased with the groups working on silicon chip fabrication and packaging. These aren't &quot;skunkworks&quot; intended to produce a new product. They're special teams working at the cutting edge of technology designed to produce workable and demonstrable prototypes. &quot;Instead of doing pieces of technology,&quot; Mr. Gomory says, &quot;we produce a coherent whole.&quot;    Science and technology have changed along with the process and meaning of innovation. Organizations need to customize their definition of research and development to meet their needs. &quot;Product&quot; vs. &quot;process&quot; research, &quot;sustained&quot; vs. &quot;pioneering&quot; research and new mechanisms to link innovators are but a few examples of the dimensions along which Randamp;D priorities should be evaluated. The &quot;creative struggle,&quot; as Xerox's Mr. Brown puts it, isn't just about innovating for the marketplace -- it's innovating a new understanding of what research and development should mean to the organization.    ---   Mr. Schrage, a contributing editor at Manhattan Inc., is a visiting scholar at MIT's Media Lab in Cambridge, Mass. </TEXT></DOC>
