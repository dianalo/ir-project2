American industry has grown leaner and meaner after years of hardship, they say. The dollar's continuing slide may help manufacturers finally come up trumps, says Charles Clough, a Merrill Lynch investment strategist. Furthermore, the recent stock market crash could signal the end of an era when consumer spending drove the U.S. economy and consumer stocks were kings, some economists say.    &quot;Because of the dollar, the U.S. is returning from a consumption economy to an industrial economy,&quot; Mr. Clough says. He thinks the next bull market, when it comes, could be led by such capital-goods stocks as Caterpillar and Hewlett-Packard, not by consumer stocks such as Limited and Ralston Purina.    Capital-goods stocks are for patient investors, he cautions. But he thinks they &quot;could take off in 1988&quot; on prospects of &quot;several years of good earnings growth.&quot;    The dollar's steep slide in recent years -- along with corporate restructurings and tax cuts -- already has made U.S. manufacturers more competitive. Japan's Honda and Komatsu are planning new U.S. plants because &quot;it's cheaper for them to produce here,&quot; says David Gardner, an analyst at Nomura Securities International.    But a still-lower dollar, which would help U.S. manufacturers even more while curbing consumers' taste for imports, may be needed to narrow the U.S. trade deficit, some economists say. Moreover, they think the Federal Reserve will restrain interest rates to keep industry growing in 1988. Any slowdown might be confined to consumer spending, they argue.    Already in 1986, U.S. industrial production -- crucial for capital goods stocks -- began outstripping overall economic growth, says Nomura's Mr. Gardner. He sees a lower dollar helping U.S. capital goods makers two ways: They will sell more goods abroad and will sell at prices below those of foreign competitors at home.    Besides Caterpillar, he is recommending Eaton Corp., which makes transmissions for heavy trucks, and Parker-Hannifin and Trinova, makers of hydraulic components.    &quot;I've invested 60% of my funds in industrial America,&quot; says Kenneth Heebner, a fund manager at Loomis Sayles. Mr. Heebner's industrial stockholdings, bought earlier this year, lost much value in the market's tumble, but he is unrepentant.    He has big bets on capital goods plays like Caterpillar and Trinity Industries, which makes rail cars, and also on steel and aluminum. &quot;They're all related,&quot; he says; basic industry will use a lot of earth-moving equipment and rail cars.    Some money managers favor paper and chemical stocks, which have been showing big profit gains. The lower dollar and lower stock prices make some paper companies appear to be likely takeover candidates, adds Sherman Chao, a Salomon Brothers analyst.    Currently, many investors aren't sure the U.S. economy will grow much in 1988. So they have sought refuge in utilities and beverage companies like Coca-Cola, which tend to hold up in hard times. Yet there is cause for caution. A dollar collapse or an inflationary surge might make the Fed raise rates and squeeze the whole economy, analysts say.    Recession or not, the recent commodity price boom -- which has been driving paper and chemical companies' profits -- may be over, some analysts think.    A 1988 recession could cut paper product prices by 10% and profits of companies like Great Northern Nekoosa by 35%, says Gary Palmero, an Oppenheimer analyst. After the market crash, he recommended some paper stocks &quot;as a trade&quot; on grounds they might rebound by 50%. He says they still have about 25% to go.    Dollar plays can be tricky. Caterpillar, a stock that symbolizes investors' hopes for industrial rebirth, has shown disappointing earnings for several years, despite the falling dollar. Bullish analysts regularly have driven the stock up, only to see it tumble again.    The problem, says Nomura's Mr. Gardner: Caterpillar in the 1980s sold a lot of smaller equipment, competing successfully against foreign manufacturers. But the machines weren't as lucrative as big, heavy equipment sold in the 1970s to oil-rich countries for industrial projects, he says. Now, he predicts growing demand for heavy machines and spare parts from U.S. mines, a big Caterpillar market.    Len Kuchan, Caterpillar's treasurer, says orders for big tractors and trucks &quot;have been improving steadily since last spring,&quot; indicating better profit margins ahead. &quot;At some point,&quot; he adds, orders from the energy sector could pick up, too.    At 49 3/4 Friday, Caterpillar sold for about 18 times projected 1987 profit, which analysts put at $2.70 a share. Sandamp;P 500 companies trade at about 14 times earnings. But if Caterpillar's profit explodes in 1988, as analysts expect -- to $4.35 a share -- the stock now could look quite cheap in hindsight. </TEXT></DOC>
