McGraw-Hill Inc.'s F.W. Dodge division said the value of construction contracts awarded in December advanced to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $250.34 billion from $241.12 billion in the previous month. November's contracting had fallen 8% from October.    The year's &quot;record total of newly started projects assures a sustained high level of building-materials demand and employment in construction through most of 1988,&quot; according to George A. Christie, Dodge vice president and chief economist.    But Mr. Christie said the industry faces tough challenges in the coming year: &quot;a vast surplus of vacant offices and apartments, the repeal of tax incentives for commercial building, the mandate for (federal) deficit reduction and a severe regional imbalance of construction demand.&quot;    Contracting for nonresidential building showed a healthy 6% December rise to an annual rate of $92.26 billion. The month brought a solid gain in contracting for commercial and industrial building and a small setback in previously strong institutional building.    For nonbuilding construction -- which includes public works and utilities -- contracting showed a 4% rise in December to an annual rate of $42.31 billion, reflecting strength in roadbuilding.    Residential building, at an annual rate of $115.78 billion in December, was held to a 2% increase from the previous month, as a December gain in contracting for single-family homes was offset by a decline of multifamily projects.    The Dodge index of construction contracting, which compares current activity with a 1977 base of 100, rose to 159 in December from 153 a month earlier.    For the year, total new construction contracts were up 2% to $254.67 billion from $248.59 billion a year earlier. But the research concern pointed out that the overall gain hid a wide disparity in regional trends.    For the Northeast and the North Central areas, it said, 1987 was a &quot;banner year,&quot; bringing improvements of 12% and 9%, respectively. In the South, where construction activity has been declining since 1985, contracting stabilized last year but failed to recover. The West saw the end of several boom years, as contracting fell 6%.    Contracting for the year on nonresidential building rose 7% to a record $89.42 billion. Nonbuilding construction advanced 8% to $45.33 billion, also a new high. But the value of newly begun residential structures declined 2% last year to $119.91 billion.    ---                                 a-Dec.
