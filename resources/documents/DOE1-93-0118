IRIS work station. Editfont consists of approximately 3500 linesof code, including the program documentation. Fonts created by Editfontcan be retrieved from disk and high-level routines implemented with theIRIS graphics library. One feature of the system is the capacity forfont extraction from a picture. The steps for font generation via fontextraction are explained in detail. File formats, data structures androutines used by the system are also described. Software and hardwarelimitations of the system are outlined, as well as possible future extensions.</TEXT></DOC>
