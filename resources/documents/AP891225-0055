The mass mailing of tax packages, which carries a $26 millionpricetag for printing and postage, is conducted every yearimmediately after Christmas.   Some taxpayers may already have received their forms, becausetheir local postmaster jumped the gun. The forms have been sittingin post offices with IRS instructions not to mail them until afterChristmas, but every year some postmasters send them early anyway.   In an effort to reassure jittery taxpayers, officials arestressing that the forms contain few changes. But much to thechagrin of the IRS, one of the changes should not have been made.   The problem involves the catastrophic health program, whichCongress voted to repeal in November after a revolt among theelderly who would have had to foot the bill. The wealthiest seniorcitizens would have faced an added tax burden of $800.   The tax liability was abolished along with the decision to scrapthe program. However, the congressional action came too late tochange the tax forms, which were printed up in October withoutdated information about the now obsolete tax.   The IRS hopes to keep confusion to a minimum with a publicitycampaign. Also, no form exists for taxpayers to compute theirliability under the catastrophic program.   If some taxpayers still fail to receive the word and include anamount on the line for the Medicare premium, the IRS says it willrefund the money. IRS official Arthur Altman estimated 12 millionelderly taxpayers could be led astray.   The IRS said this year's forms, which should be in most homesbefore New Year's Day, will offer relatively minor changes.   Among them:   _ The personal exemption, the amount you may exempt fromtaxation for yourself, your spouse and each dependent, increases to$2,000 per person, up from $1,950 last year.   _ The standard deduction, claimed by people who do not itemize,rises to $3,100 for a single person, up from $3,000 last year,while the exemption for a couple increases to $5,200, up from$5,000 last year.   _ Tax rates remain the same at 15 percent, 28 percent and 33percent, but the tax brackets have been widened so that more incomewill be taxed at a lower rate, thus compensating for the impact ofinflation.   _ Bowing to the increase in separate last names for husband andwife, the IRS for the first time will include two lines, instead ofone, so that spouses filing a joint return can enter their namesand Social Security numbers on separate lines.   _ Taxpayers must show the Social Security number for anydependent they claim who is age 2 or older. Last year, the cutoffwas age 5.   _ Families with income as high as $19,340 may qualify for anearned-income credit, up from a limit of $18,576 last year.   _ In one of the few changes with an adverse impact, only 20percent of interest paid on credit card debt, auto loans and otherpersonal debt will be deductible on 1989 returns, down from 40percent last year.   The tax forms must be filed this year by April 16, one day laterthan normal because April 15 falls on a Sunday.   The IRS expects about 111.2 million individual income taxreturns will be filed for the 1989 tax year. The majority oftaxpayers, 65 percent, will end up using the comprehensive Form1040, designed for taxpayers who itemize or who have incomes above$50,000 annually.   The rest who do not itemize and meet other qualifications canfile the more simple Form 1040A or the simplest of all, thenine-line Form 1040EZ. The form a taxpayer receives in the mail isbased on the form the taxpayer used last year.   All the tax forms come with a pitch from new IRS CommissionerFred T. Goldberg Jr. urging taxpayers to consider filing theirreturns electronically.   Offered this year for the first time nationwide, electronicfiling features the advantage of cutting down the time required toprocess refund checks to three weeks, compared to the normal six to10 weeks.   In 1988, two-thirds of all taxpayers qualified for a refund withthe average refund totaling $875.   The IRS hopes that 2 million taxpayers will file their returnselectronically this year and it is providing a toll free telephonenumber, 1-800-424-1040, for people to call for a list of taxpreparers in their area who have the capability of filing returnselectronically.</TEXT></DOC>
