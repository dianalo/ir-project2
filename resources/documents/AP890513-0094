Most alarming, says the Mother's Day report issued by the OlderWomen's League, is that while life expectancy increases, the ranksof younger people who can care for the elderly are shrinking, sincethe baby-boom generation has created a baby bust by having fewerchildren.   Already, Americans 85 and older, the group most in need oflong-term care, are the fastest growing segment of the population,with their numbers projected to increase from 2.9 million to 5million by the year 2,000, the study says. It estimated that theover-65 population, meanwhile, will more than double to 52 million,or one in six people, in the same period.   ``On average, women today spend 17 years of their lives caringfor children and 18 years assisting aged parents. For the firsttime ever, American couples have more parents than children. Theresult will be a significant decline in the number of familycaregivers at the same time the need increases dramatically,'' thereport said.   The study, titled ``Failing America's Caregivers: a StatusReport on Women Who Care,'' was partially funded by the Charles H.Revson Foundation and the American Federation of Federal, State,County and Municipal Employes, AFL-CIO. It was derived from censusdata and a dozens of congressional, academic and other independentstudies concerning the elderly, as well as original research by thestaff of the Older Women's League, a non-profit advocacy group withmore than 120 chapters.   OWL President Lou Glasse noted the findings indicate that ``In1989, a woman whose children are grown has completed, on average,less than half the caregiving she will provide during her life. Farfrom being free of responsibility, in many cases her most difficultyears lie ahead.   ``Already,'' she said, ``nearly two million women are part ofthe `sandwich' generation, caring simultaneously for children andparents. Millions more go very quickly from child care to eldercare.   ``Over the next few decades,'' said Ms. Glasse, ``America willhave fewer caregivers, many more people who need care, and morewomen in the paid work force with less time to give. If thesetrends continue, we will face a crisis of enormous proportions.''   The report said that ``while child care has been the work andfamily conflict of the 1980s ... elder care will be the No. 1workplace issue of the 1990s, as women struggle to hold paying jobswhile caring for elderly parents and spouses.''   Other findings:   _Among children who care for their parents, daughters outnumbersons three to one. The average caregiver is 45 years old, female,and married. But 35 percent of caregivers to the elderly arethemselves over 65 years old, and 10 percent are over 75. As womenoutlive men and often marry older men, many become caregivers totheir spouses.   _About 89 percent of women over age 18 will provide care tochildren, parents, or both, and 31 percent will care for bothchildren and parents.   _About 52 percent of the married mothers of infants and 55percent of women caring for elderly relatives are in the workforce, and women working full-time are four times more likely to beprimary caregivers to the elderly as are working men.   _Ninety-five percent of the elderly and 90 percent of thedisabled elderly live at home, with family members providingvirtually all their care. The cost of outside care for the elderlyis enormously more expensive than for children. Day care forchildren averages $3,000 annually, compared to $25,000 for anursing home for the elderly.   _During the 1990s, the number of elderly in the South and Westwill increase about 20 percent, with the greatest increases inNevada, 70 percent; Arizona, 50 percent; and Florida, 39 percent.   OWL said the report demonstrates the need for legislation toprotect the jobs of people caring for parents and spouses, as wellas children, and to provide more federal assistance for thelong-term care of the chronically ill.</TEXT></DOC>
