Parametershave been determined as a result of comparison of theelectron (M/sub2/Cl/sub 8/)/sup n-/ (M=Mo, Tc, Re; n=4, 3, 2) structure prepared bySNDO method with the results of calculations by SCF-X/sub {alpha}/-SWmethod as well as ab initio. The results obtained by using parametersdetermined by such a way allow to describe correctly charge distributionin complexes, bond orders, as well as orbital energies, but they describeunsatisfactorily electron transformations.</TEXT></DOC>
