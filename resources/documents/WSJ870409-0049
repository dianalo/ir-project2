An administration source said the council agreed on the proposed panel during a White House meeting yesterday. A commission would be another demonstration of direct White House involvement in combating the disease, which has killed nearly 20,000 in the U.S. since it was diagnosed in 1981.    President Reagan had been criticized for providing inadequate leadership on the issue. Last week he gave his first speech on AIDS, and yesterday Vice President George Bush received a briefing on the virus, with reporters present, at the National Institutes of Health.    Some White House officials believe that the administration should establish a presidential commission before Congress sets up a commission.    On Friday, Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas proposed legislation that would form an AIDS commission to examine and make recommendations on issues of public education, employment and government cooperation with other countries. </TEXT></DOC>
