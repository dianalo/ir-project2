A Genetics spokeswoman said the FDA usually takes 12 to 18months to evaluate such submissions.</LP><TEXT>   Recombinate is a genetically engineered form of theblood-clotting protein Factor VIII, which is used to treathemophilia, a condition that afflicts more than 50,000 malesworld-wide, Genetics said.   &quot;We believe that people with hemophilia are eagerlyanticipating approval by the FDA of Recombinate as analternative replacement for existing plasma-derivedproducts,&quot; said Gabriel Schmergel, president and chiefexecutive officer of Genetics Institute.   Genetics Institute cloned and developed the drug, and itwill supply a significant portion of Baxter's continuingcommercial requirements.   Baxter, Genetics Institute's licensing partner, isresponsible for the clinical development, final manufactureand world-wide marketing of Recombinate.   In 1988, Genetics Institute was granted a U.S. patent forthe process to make recombinant Factor VIII, which it said isone of the largest proteins ever produced using geneticengineering techniques. In March 1989, Genetics Institute andBaxter announced a world-wide patent cross-licensingagreement concerning recombinant Factor VIII with GenentechInc. and Miles Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
