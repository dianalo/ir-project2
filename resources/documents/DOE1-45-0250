Materialscontaining V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, V{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and Cu are promising inthis respect. The authors have studied the phase composition and thetemperature dependence of conductivity of samples made from mixturesof these substances. The results of studies of the phase compositionand properties of ceramics consisting of V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, V{sub 2}O{sub3}, and Cu make it possible to optimize their composition, and indicatethat the required heat-strength characteristics are due to the presenceof V{sub 2}O{sub 5} in the original mixture, while the electrophysicalcharacteristics are governed by the presence of a mixture of V{sub 2}O{sub3} and metallic copper.</TEXT></DOC>
