Mazowiecki unveiled nominees for his 22-member cabinet before a closed meeting of Solidarity's parliamentary deputies, and it appeared that the union would take less than half the portfolios. The Peasants Party would get four cabinet posts, and the Democrats two. The Communist Party will retain the defense and interior ministries, but apparently lost its bid for the Foreign Ministry. Parliament is expected to vote on confirmation next week.    Poland's Catholic bishops have offered new talks with Jewish leaders on moving a disputed convent from the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.    ---   A COLOMBIAN SUSPECT FACED drug-related charges in a U.S. court.    Eduardo Martinez Romero, who is accused of helping the Medellin cocaine cartel launder at least $15 million, declined to answer the charges, telling a federal court in Atlanta through an interpreter that he speaks only Spanish and doesn't fully understand the allegations. The judge postponed the arraignment until Monday and ordered the 36-year-old Martinez, who was extradited Wednesday to the U.S. from Bogota, held without bail until then.    Bennett said Bush's anti-drug plan would cost the states &quot;several billion dollars&quot; more in the coming year. He didn't give a more precise estimate.    ---   South Africa's government pledged political changes after the ruling National Party sustained losses in Wednesday's parliamentary elections. Violence during the polling reportedly killed as many as 25 people. The party lost nearly a quarter of its seats to an anti-apartheid party and to rightist candidates.    ---   East-West talks resumed in Vienna on an accord to reduce conventional weapons in Europe by next year. But a dispute within NATO delayed a proposal to advance the negotiations with the Warsaw Pact. Greece, apparently because of concerns about Turkey, expressed objections to NATO plans to propose limits on military maneuvers.    ---   Energy Secretary Watkins said production of a radioactive gas used to make nuclear warheads, suspended for more than a year because of safety problems at tritium-producing plants, would resume in the fall of 1990. He said low-power testing of the government's Savannah River complex in South Carolina would start next summer.    ---   The Navy formally presented its report on the April 19 explosion aboard the USS Iowa, and said that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig &quot;most likely&quot; caused the blast by placing a detonator between gunpowder bags in one of the battleship's guns. Hartwig was among the 47 sailors killed. The Navy said much data was &quot;circumstantial.&quot;    ---   A Senate panel approved a permanent ban on smoking on all domestic airline flights. The prohibition cleared by the Appropriations Committee, part of a $26.5 billion transportation spending bill for the year beginning Oct. 1, would significantly expand the current ban on smoking on flights of two hours or less.    ---   Budapest indicated that thousands of East German refugees could leave Hungary within days in a mass exodus to the West. The signal came despite West Germany's announcement that talks with East Berlin officials failed to break an impasse on the refugee issue. There are about 6,000 East Germans awaiting passage from Hungary.    ---   Ethiopia and Eritrean rebels opened talks in Atlanta in an effort to end the civil war that began in 1961, Africa's longest-running conflict. Former President Carter, acting as an observer to the closed-door peace negotiations, expressed hope that the two sides would allow free passage of food to Ethiopia's war-torn northern province.    ---   Cuba announced that it would begin withdrawing its troops from Ethiopia tomorrow. The soldiers were first sent into the African nation in 1977 to help the Marxist government in its war with Somalia. Havana didn't disclose how many troops would leave.    ---   The Bush administration intends to continue consultations with other nations to try to end the civil war in Lebanon, despite Wednesday's pullout of all U.S. diplomats from the embassy in Beirut. In Lebanon, Christian army commander Aoun, blamed for prompting the evacuation, called the U.S. move &quot;biased and shortsighted.&quot;    ---   Attackers in Jordan fired several rockets into Israel for the first time in about 20 years. The Soviet-made rockets, which didn't cause any injuries or damage, landed in the Jordan Valley. In Jerusalem, Israeli Premier Shamir said it was Amman's responsibility to prevent such attacks.    ---   A strike in Azerbaijan appeared to be gaining strength after a nationalist demonstration in Baku by at least 200,000 people demanding more autonomy for the Soviet republic. The railway strike in Azerbaijan, as well as a separate rail strike in Moldavia, have put pressure on the oil industry, which has turned to sea transport. </TEXT></DOC>
