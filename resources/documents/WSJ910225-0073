Glaxo is the world'ssecond-largest maker of prescription drugs, and Mr. Riordan'slittle company was less than three years old.   But Mr. Riordan, chief executive officer of GileadSciences Inc., a Foster City, Calif., biotechnology concern,says he was stunned when no fewer than 30 Glaxo executivesand scientists showed up at the signing in September. Somecame from as far away as London, and they far outnumberedGilead's total staff at the time.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It was a cause for celebration,&quot; says Thomas D'Alonzo,group vice president of Glaxo's U.S. subsidiary. In returnfor helping fund Gilead's development of a new anti-cancerdrug, Glaxo will obtain rights to market the druginternationally.   As this series will illustrate, big companies like Glaxoare increasingly turning to close alliances with smallcompanies. Through joint ventures, equity investments andother deals, the big companies get quick access to newtechnology and entrepreneurship. The small companies getmoney and the credibility that a big corporate ally canprovide. Though the entrepreneurs risk being smothered bygiants, many are learning to protect themselves -- andfinding that they are in a stronger position than they oncethought.   &quot;Interest in alliances skyrocketed after the stock-marketcrash of 1987,&quot; says John Wilkerson, president of WilkersonGroup Inc., a health-care-industry consultant. Before 1987,there were about 350 strategic deals a year in thehealth-care field, he says. After the market crash, thenumbers soared to between 550 to 575 annually, Mr. Wilkersonadds, explaining that many small companies turned to dealswith big companies because other sources of financing weresuddenly closed off.   Enthusiasm for alliances also is on the rise in thecomputer business. &quot;You know the interest is high when Intel{Corp.} and IBM {International Business Machines Corp.} --companies that didn't much care for start-ups -- beginactively seeking out smaller strategic partners,&quot; saysRichard Shaffer, editor and publisher of Technologic ComputerLetter, a New York-based computer-industry newsletter.   The same trend is seen in other industries. Moreover, manybig companies are increasing their reliance on smallcompanies for parts.   &quot;Five years ago, you wouldn't have seen this happen,&quot; saysTamara Erickson, vice president of Arthur D. Little Inc., theCambridge, Mass., consulting giant, referring to the pace ofthe new alliances. Big companies then almost entirely reliedon their internal research and development for new ideas andtechnologies. But with the increasing cost of introducing newproducts, &quot;board rooms are under pressure&quot; to avoid thenot-invented-here syndrome and accelerate productintroduction, Ms. Erickson says. &quot;They are turning to smallcompanies for innovation.&quot;   Big companies also see ventures with small companies as aquick way to explore new markets. Sony Corp. of America, forexample, has established several alliances with smallbusinesses. &quot;We're ambitious,&quot; says Ron Sommer, the SonyCorp. unit's president. &quot;The more areas we want to cover, themore willing we have to be to have partners.&quot;   Small companies also better understand the need foralliances and are learning how to avoid giving the storeaway, says Jordan Lewis, a Washington, D.C., consultant.&quot;They also know more about who makes a good partner and whodoesn't,&quot; he says.   For small companies, big-company interest couldn't come ata better time. Two of the biggest sources of small-companygrowth financing, venture-capital funds and initial publicofferings, have been drying up. And the capital void is beingfilled by big companies, says Jeremy Kendall, chief executiveofficer of Stake Technology Ltd., Norval, Canada.   For instance, Chesapeake Corp., a big Richmond, Va., papermaker, invested about $250,000 in Stake to develop a systemto process recycled paper and products. The two concernsagreed to form a new company to market the system once it hadbeen tested in 150 trials at Chesapeake. Chesapeake agreed toprovide the initial $2.5 million for the new company.   &quot;It's very difficult for a small company to initiate a newtechnology, especially in a mature business like pulp andpaper,&quot; Mr. Kendall says. The relationship with Chesapeakenot only accelerated the development of the system but alsoprovides the credibility other buyers want, he says.   In working closely with small companies, big companiesalso are tapping into years of research and development, saysDean Corley, Motorola Inc.'s manager of equipment R andamp; D inTempe, Ariz. Motorola used a computer system developed byApplied Intelligent Systems Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich., toinspect the printing of semiconductor chips. But after usingthe computer system extensively for two years, Motorolarecently decided on a joint development with Applied tocreate a newer system for all of Motorola's chip making.Motorola says it has gained a technology it would be hardpressed to create on its own. The parallel-processingtechnology used by Applied is relatively new tomanufacturing, Mr. Corley notes. To try to duplicate thetechnology within Motorola would take tremendous time andexpense, he adds.   The joint project is expected to bring Applied largerevenues through the computers it will sell to Motorola.Applied also will be able to sell the new system on its own,notes James Anderson, Applied's chief executive officer.   In biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, where manyof the alliances between big and small companies now occur,&quot;big companies are discovering it is cheaper to buy than tomake,&quot; says Teena Lerner, a biotechnology-industry analyst atShearson Lehman Brothers. The average cost today ofdeveloping a new drug is $231 million, a recent drug-industrystudy concludes. But many entrepreneurial companies,including Amgen Inc. and Immunex Corp., have produced drugsfor far less, Ms. Lerner notes.   &quot;Small companies are not only entrepreneurial but carry ontheir research in a swift, focused, decisive manner,&quot; saysventure capitalist Joseph F.X. McGuirl, once head oflicensing and corporate development at a big pharmaceuticalcompany. &quot;They are able to reach strategic decisions rapidly,an advantage not usually enjoyed by larger companies,&quot; heexplains.   Small companies in biotechnology have demonstrated theirability to do &quot;not just R faster but D faster,&quot; says StephenDuzan, chief executive officer of Immunex Corp., a Seattle,Wash., biotechnology concern. &quot;Things move quickly. There'sless bureaucracy,&quot; he adds. Immunex has succeeded in takingseven products to clinical trials for less than $85 million,he says.   Immunex, which expects revenue of about $35 million in1990, has licensed five products to big companies, includingHoffmann-La Roche, Syntex Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.   All the success stories notwithstanding, alliances dounravel. Big corporations continue to back away from somealliances because they didn't put the deal together properlyfrom the start, says Mr. McGuirl, the venture capitalist.Over time, corporations often won't devote the proper levelof resources they may have indicated at the onset. As aresult, he says, some small companies are buying backimportant technologies from big corporate partners.   Late last month, Escagenetics Corp., a small San Carlos,Calif., food-biotechnology concern, announced that it wouldbuy back the share of Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., ina potato-seed-development venture the two companies began in1988. &quot;Pioneer's strategy in the vegetable-seed area haschanged since the joint venture was formed,&quot; said HerbEckhouse, a Pioneer executive. Escagenetics, meanwhile, isout looking for another partner.   ---                  Some Strategic Alliances                                                                                                        LARGE COMPANY  SMALL COMPANY       DATE  TYPE OF ALLIANCE IBM            Geographic Systems  1989  Marketing and                                          development                                                                                                        Motorola       Applied Intelligent 1990  Product                Systems                   development                                                                                                        Sony           Panavision          1988  System development                                                                                                        Glaxo          Gilead Sciences     1990  Sales and                                          marketing                                                                                                        Upjohn         Biopure             1990  Sales and                                          marketing                                                                                                        Chesapeake     Stake Technology    1990  System development                                                                                                        Kodak          Immunex             1988  Technology                                          development</TEXT></DOC>
