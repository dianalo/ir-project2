(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A Quicker ROM ReadandM;While pundits have been incorrectly predicting The Year of CD-ROM for a longtime now, hardware manufacturers have nonetheless been steadily improvingtheir products in anticipation of increased demand.andP;  The Intersect CDR-72external CD-ROM Reader from NEC Technologies Inc. is a product that showsthat past criticisms leveled at ROM drives--specifically, their slowperformance--are becoming less and less an issue.andM;The CDR-72 lists for $999, but has a mail-order price of only $645 to $720.andO;(There is also an internal version available, the CDR-82.)andP;  The CDR-72 iscompetitively priced and offers generally superior performance.andP;  Typical seektimes for the unit are about 350ms.andP;  With data transfer rates of 150K persecond on a continuous basis.andM;While 350ms, may sound slow compared to your average hard drive, it's asclose to warp speed as CD-ROM drives get.andP;  Their typical access times are500ms.andP;  to 600ms., which makes the CDR-72 about the fastest CD-ROM drive onthe market.andM;Interface kits for the CDR-72 are available for XT/AT-type computers,PS/2-compatible units, Macintosh, and NEC laptops with an LTX expansion slot(such as the ProSpeed liee.andP;  Unfortunately, the interface kits are not partof the list price, and range from $99 for the Mac kit to $299 for the PS/2kit.andM;The CDR-72 is highly compatible, and can work with all leading CD-ROM dataformats, including High Sierra, ISO 9660, and Apple Macintosh HFS.andP;  So forthe price of a second iterface kit, you could share the easily transportable7.7-pound unit between different hardware platforms or among severalcomputers, depending upon the number of interface kits you are willing andable to buy.andM;Setting up the CDR-72 is a relatively simple procedure, though it can involvea bit of work depending upon your hardware configuration.andP;  The SCSI interfaceboard plugs into any full or half-sized ISA compatible slot, and the basicsettings for the board's one jumper and set of DIP swiches will probably notneed to be changed very often.andM;The software has an auto-install program that copies all the necessary driverfiles to your hard drive and adjusts your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT filesso that you can access the CD-ROM player as one of your disk drives.andP;  In mostcases, that's all you need to get the drive up and running.andP;  However, if youhave numerous DOS partitions on your hard drive, you will need to go in andedit your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files on your own, specifying whichdrive you want to assign to the CDR-72.andM;Beyond installation, there is little to be concerned about regarding theunit's operation, and almost no controls to deal with.andP;  The front of the unithas the power switch, an eject button, and a volume control and headphone ackfor personal stereo-type headphones.andP;  The SCSI connectors, AC connection, andtwo RCA output jacks (for conection to an external amplifier) are located onthe rear of the unit.andM;The CDR-72 worked smoothly and flawlessly with a host of CD-ROM software,including Microsoft Bookshelf, NEC's Image Gallery (a library of clip art),and several other reference and game disks.andP;  I found it was notably faster inoperation than the 500ms.-class drives I have used, which is a plus when youare searching a drive full of data (it can accommodate up to 680MB of data).andO;One particularly nice feature is that the dirve can also be positionedvertically (it comes with snap-on stands for that purpose), in case you aretight on desk space.andM;And while it clearly isn't the main reason to buy the CDR-72, the audiocapability is a nice plus.andP;  You can always relax with a little SineadO'Connor or Stevie Ray Vaughan when you're not accessing some huge library ofCD-ROM data.andM;The supplied documentation is minimal, but should nonetheless be adequate toget the unit installed and running without a hitch.andP;  NEC backs the CDR-72with toll-free technical support and a one-year warranty on parts and labor.andM;All told, NEC's CDR-72 is an attractive package.andP;  You get the ability to usethe drive with any type of popular PC platform, good technical support, andabout the fastest drive performance you can buy--all without paying a premiumcompared to slower CD-ROM drves.andP;  If you want top performance in a versatileCD-ROM drive, the NEC Itersect CDR-72 CD-ROM Reader is a good place to start.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
