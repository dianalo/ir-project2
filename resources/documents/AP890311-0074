Those who signed the accord included King Hussein of Jordan andpresidents Francois Mitterrand of France, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.   The meeting, arranged by the Dutch government, followed an ozoneconference of 123 nations earlier this week in London. At thatsession, 20 countries promised to join 33 nations that have alreadyagreed to halve emissions of ozone-destroying chemicals by the endof the century.   The United States and the 12-nation European Community have gonefurther. They have pledged to try to ban the chemicals, calledchlorofluorocarbons, by 1999 if safe alternatives can be developed.   The compounds have widespread use in aerosol spray cans andrefrigerators, as well as in the electronics and plastics industries.   The new pact, billed as the ``Hague Declaration,'' says theUnited Nations should be given authority to set and monitor airpollution rules, according to a Western diplomat familiar with thedocument's contents. He spoke on condition of anonymity.   However, the proposal would be an agreement in principle withoutlegal force on the nations that sign it, the diplomat said.   He said the document does not specify whether there should be anew U.N. body to fight air pollution or whether the newresponsibilities should fall to a strengthened U.N. EnvironmentProgram, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya.   Either way, he said, the United Nations would get authority to``define standards to enhance or guarantee the protection of theatmosphere and monitor compliance,'' the diplomat quoted the Haguedocument as saying.   The participants at the conference discussed the gradualdepletion of the delicate ozone shield that protects Earth fromcancer-causing solar radiation and the rise in global temperaturesknown as the greenhouse effect.   Government leaders at the Dutch gathering included West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl, and premiers Felipe Gonzalez of Spain,Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden and Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway.   The Hague document says the World Court should back up U.N.efforts to control the chemicals, the diplomat said. But heacknowledged that the court, the U.N.'s legal arm, depends onvoluntary compliance.   He said details of the proposal will be worked out in the nextfew months and a broader international accord on atmosphericpollution is expected to be signed by October. Any changes in U.N.authority would also need approval of the body's General Assembly inNew York.</TEXT></DOC>
