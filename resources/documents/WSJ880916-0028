Long-term Treasury bonds declined about 1/4 of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year bonds climbed back up to 9% from 8.97% Wednesday. Municipal and corporate bonds were little changed to slightly lower, also in light trading.    Yesterday's mild setback followed gains in Treasury bond prices in 11 of the 13 previous trading sessions. Peter Bass, a managing director at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co., said bonds &quot;were due for some type of correction&quot; in view of the market's strong price gains in recent weeks.    Those gains largely reflected several government reports indicating slower economic growth, a development many analysts interpreted as a sign that would help keep inflation under control. But some of the latest reports have contained conflicting signals, leading many traders to conclude that the next major turning point probably will come Oct. 7, when the Labor Department is scheduled to release its employment report for September.    &quot;The mood at best is confused,&quot; said Mr. Bass. &quot;People don't know if this is a real turn in interest rates or whether it's just a hesitation before the resumption of the bear market.&quot;    The economy &quot;is going to fool a lot of people,&quot; predicted Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. &quot;It's stronger than the August numbers have suggested.&quot; He contended there is &quot;a clear potential for an acceleration of inflation&quot; that will cause the Federal Reserve to tighten credit, increasing short-term interest rates.    &quot;I'm not looking for an explosion in inflation or interest rates either,&quot; Mr. Fine said. &quot;But I do see a gradual increase in rates.&quot;    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Boat loans became the newest target of securitization as Chemical Bank made the first public offering.    Chemical sold $381 million of pass-through certificates with a 9.10% coupon rate at 99 19/32 to yield 9.30%, 88 basis points above a Treasury issue with a 2.4-year maturity, through a group led by the bank and First Boston Corp.    The issue, via Chemical Bank Grantor Trust 1988-B, is backed by a pool of loans on motorboats and sailboats from the bank's portfolio. Chemical is the biggest maker of boat loans in New York.    The yield on the certificates is slightly higher than the rate on similarly structured offerings backed by auto loans and credit-card receivables. The yield premium could reflect investor unfamiliarity with boat-loan securities.    The underlying loans have an average maturity of 10 years, but the estimated average life on the securities is only 2.4 years, because owners usually hold their boats for just a few years.    There could be further securitization of the $9 billion of marine loans outstanding in the U.S. because the Federal Reserve's proposed capital adequacy guidelines require banks to hold a substantial amount of capital against boat loans.    The Chemical issue is expected to get a triple-A rating from Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. based on a 9% surety bond from Capital Markets Assurance Corp., a wholly owned but independent unit of Citicorp.    There is no guarantee from Chemical Bank or its parent, Chemical Banking Corp. That helped Chemical treat the offering as a sale of assets.    In the mortgage securities market, prices were little changed in light afternoon dealings as attention was focused on a $500 million Remic from Fannie Mae, the agency's first in nearly a month. A Remic is a real estate mortgage investment conduit.    The issue is backed by Fannie Mae's 10% securities, which have been popular collateral for Remic offerings during the past few months.    Fannie Mae decided to retain a $217 million floating-rate class for its more than $100 billion mortgage portfolio. The remaining Remic securities, in 11 classes, were offered publicly by Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.    Among active mortgage pass-through issues, Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for September delivery was quoted at 94 30/32, unchanged; Ginnie Mae's 10% issue at 100 5/ 8, also flat; Freddie Mac's 10% issue at 100 6/32, down 2/32; and Fannie Mae's 10% securities at 100 18/32, unchanged.    The Ginnie Mae 10% issue was yielding 10.03% to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note narrowed three basis points to 113 basis points. -   Treasury Securities   An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which rose 3.16 points on Wednesday, fell by exactly the same amount yesterday.    The index finished the day at 1244.35. That was only slightly higher than its low for the day of 1243.70. The high was 1250.29.    Among actively traded issues, the government's latest 30-year bonds fell to 101 10/32 from 101 18/32. The latest 10-year issue declined to 102 7/32 from 102 3/8, while the yield rose to 8.90% from 8.88%.    The yield on the latest two-year Treasury notes rose to 8.37% from 8.32%. The yield on notes due in about five years climbed to 8.64% from 8.59%.    Rates also rose on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bill climbed to 7.18% bid from 7.14%, while the latest six-month bill rate rose to 7.38% bid from 7.34%.    Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to slightly weaker as several more large new issues hit the market.    Underwriters calculate that more than $1 billion of tax-exempt bonds were offered to investors on Wednesday alone. Yesterday afternoon, underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets tentatively priced a $356 million issue of bonds from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York.    Moreover, traders are beginning to focus on the fact that rates are approaching levels where more and more issuers will be taking a hard look at refunding outstanding bonds. Underwriters estimate that a spurt of refundings are likely to take place if yields drop another 1/4 of a percentage point.    The MTA offering was oversubscribed in most maturities by late afternoon, according to an official with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    The MTA's refunding bonds were tentatively priced to yield from 5.70% in 1989 to 7.75% in 2017. The deal includes serial bonds due 1989-2003, zero coupon term bonds due 2006 and current interest term bonds due 2008 and 2017. All the bonds are AMBAC-insured.    Persistently strong investor demand has prevented the municipal market, including the New York sector, from suffering unduly under the weight of new issues, traders say. Indeed, although some expressed concerns about mounting supply, others complained about the lack of allotments of recent new offerings.    Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices were little changed to slightly lower in light trading.    A handful of new issues came to market yesterday, including a first-time sale in the public U.S. credit markets by Toyota Motor Credit Corp., the U.S. finance subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp. Underwriters said the issue sold out.    Toyota Motor Credit's $200 million offering of three-year, 8 3/4% notes were priced at 99.80 to yield 8.826%. That was 0.38 percentage point above the yield on three-year Treasury notes.    The offering, lead-managed by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., marked one of the few times a non-government controlled Japanese industrial concern has raised straight debt in the U.S. market. While Japanese government entities and banks have issued straight debt in the U.S., Japan's industrial companies mostly have been deterred by the detailed nature of Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements.    Also priced yesterday was a $100 million five-year bond issue for Carolina Power andamp; Light Co. The bonds were priced at 99 7/8 to yield 9.03%, a spread of 0.45 percentage point above the yield on Treasury five-year notes.    A Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. group won the issue with a bid that provided the company with a net interest cost of 9.11%. The second place bid, by a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. group, provided a net interest cost to the company of 9.114%.    Foreign Bonds   British and Canadian government bond prices drifted lower, while West German issues were little changed in light activity.    The West German government's benchmark 6 3/4% bonds due July 1998 ended the day unchanged at 100.85, to yield 6.628%. But some other government issues weakened 0.05 point to 0.10 point.    Euromark bonds weakened slightly. Electricite de France's 6 1/8% issue of 1998 ended at 99 bid, 0.05 point lower on the day.    Economists see little pressure on the Bundesbank to tighten its credit policy in the coming weeks, despite the dollar's rally Wednesday following news that the July U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $9.53 billion from a revised $13.22 billion in June. Assuming the Federal Reserve doesn't tighten, many economists don't expect the dollar to move much higher.    In London, prices of British gilts ended 3/8 point lower as the release of new data showed continued strong economic growth and renewed fears that inflationary pressures aren't being reduced.    The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 declined 3/8 point to 113 19/32, to yield 9.94%. Among shorter-term bonds, the Treasury's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 declined 6/32 to 102 1/32 to yield 10.70%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 was down 12/32 at 106 21/32 to yield 10.42%.    Eurodollar bonds were little changed. But three borrowers took advantage of the relatively stable U.S. Treasury market to bring out moderate-sized deals.    Seagram Co., the Canadian beverage concern, issued $150 million of five-year bonds through an underwriting group led by Wood Gundy Inc. Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S, or Statoil, Norway's state-owned oil concern, offered $200 million in seven-year paper through Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.    In a later issue, Northern Telecom Ltd., the Canadian telecommunications concern, offered $100 million in five-year bonds via Salomon Brothers International.    In Canada, the benchmark 10-year issue declined 1/4 point to 100 1/2, while the yield rose to 10.17% from 10.13%. Longer-term Canadian bond prices fell even further, with some issues dropping by as much as 5/8 of a point, said Alberto Franco of Salomon Brothers Inc.    Several Canadian banks raised their prime lending rate to 11 3/4% from 11 1/4%.    The Tokyo markets were closed yesterday for a holiday. </TEXT></DOC>
