Fawaz Younis is accused of participating in the June 1985hijacking of a Jordanian jetliner en route from Beirut, Lebanon, toAmman, Jordan. Younis, held without bail since his capture inSeptember 1987, pleaded innocent to charges that carry a maximumsentence of life in prison if he is convicted.   Younis is accused of leading the hijacking in which the Boeing727 with 72 passengers and crew members was forced on aMediterranean odyssey starting and ending in Beirut. No one waskilled in the hijacking.   The prosecution contends Younis and four companions, heavilyarmed with AK-47 assault rifles, freed the hostages and blew up theaircraft on the runway at the Beirut airport.   Younis, 29, arrested in 1987 by U.S. intelligence agents, is thefirst suspected terrorist captured under the 1984 Hostage-TakingAct, which gives the United States jurisdiction outside itsterritorial boundaries when American citizens are taken hostage.   The decision to capture Younis came after the United States wasfrustrated in an attempt to gain the extradition from West Germanyof Mohammed Ali Hamadi, allegedly among hijackers of a TWA plane inwhich an American Navy diver was killed. Hamadi is on trial in WestGermany.   Younis was identified in pretrial testimony as one of the guardsin the TWA hijacking, which took place three days later, but he hasnot been charged in that case.   In an operation involving the justice, state and defensedepartments, Younis was lured by an FBI informant in Cyprus onto aU.S.-chartered yacht with the promise of a drug deal and a party.   Operating in international waters to avoid legal complicationswith other countries, FBI agents transferred Younis to a Navy supplyship in the Mediterranean, then to an aircraft carrier, and then byairplane to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.   Younis, who sustained broken wrists during his arrest, was readhis rights in Arabic and then provided interrogators with aconfession while he was at sea.   The defense argued in pretrial motions that Younis' confessionwas obtained illegally because he was seasick and in too much painto remain silent, but an appeals court has allowed the confession tobe admitted into evidence.   Evidence against Younis also includes testimony from passengersand a videotape of the defendant standing near the hijacked plane atBeirut airport. The hijackers were demanding that Palestinianguerrillas be removed from Lebanon.   Witnesses in the case include two Middle Eastern crew members,two American passengers and one Arab passanger.   William Slade, an American student who was aboard the seizedairliner, has testified that Younis spent most of the time in thecockpit but emerged about 10 times.   At a pretrial hearing Wednesday, defense attorney Francis D.Carter said he would argue that his client led the hijacking onorders from commanders of the Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem factionin Lebanon.   Carter won tentative approval from U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.Robinson to allow expert testimony concerning Amal on condition thatthe defendant testify that he was ordered by his superiors to hijackthe plane. ``If he testifies that he had a direct order, we mayallow it,'' the judge said.   However, the judge ruled out a defense based on a theory that allmechanisms of law and order had broken down in Lebanon and that``any reasonable'' person would have followed a command to hijack aplane.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson said that the hijacking``is so patently criminal that the defense of following ordersshould not be allowed in this case.''</TEXT></DOC>
