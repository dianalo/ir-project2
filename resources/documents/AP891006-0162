Manuel Antonio Noriega and use of U.S.force ``wasn't warranted under the existing circumstances.''   ``I'm not being stubborn but as I look at all the information Iwouldn't have made a different decision then,'' Bush said.   He added that he wouldn't rule out any option, includingmilitary intervention, in any future coup attempt.   Amid a torrent of complaints and questions over the U.S. action,the White House and Pentagon marched in step, saying the UnitedStates had responded correctly when rebels attempted _ and failed _to depose Noriega, who faces drug-trafficking charges in Florida.   Bush offered his defense during a closed-door meeting withSenate Republicans on Capitol Hill and then publicly afterundergoing surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center for removalof a finger cyst.   Similarly, top military leaders _ Defense Secretary Dick Cheneyand Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _testified in closed session before the Senate Intelligence andArmed Services Committees.   The two panels were preparing an analysis of issues that remainin dispute surrounding the events in Panama and contacts betweenthe rebel officers who organized the coup and U.S. officials.   Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said a lack of clearpolicy guidance from Bush had greatly contributed to U.S. confusionin dealing with the coup attempt and that there should have beenspecific arrangements for how U.S. troops were to react.   ``We have had a definite, longstanding policy in this country ofencouraging a coup'' in Panama, Nunn told reporters. ``We shouldanticipate that our policy ... might succeed. Then we have to knowwhat we're going to do next.''   Privately, a senior administration official said that with thebenefit of hindsight, the United States should have done somethings differently and had ``learned some things we need toimprove.''   Bush, however, said, ``We reviewed all the information and Idon't see anything now that would have made me make a differentdecision then.''   Many members of Congress have complained that Bush erred by notusing the 12,000 U.S. military forces in Panama to assist inTuesday's attempted coup. And the president said he knew that somepeople wanted him ``to unleash the full military to go in and getNoriega.''   Bush said the decision not to use force was made because ``Itwasn't warranted under the existing circumstances. Thecommander-in-chief must have the lives of American citizensforemost in mind when making such a decision.''   The president said he still wants to see Noriega removed frompower but ``there was never a chance to have him handed over tous.'' Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has said he had information thatthe rebels wanted to give Noriega to the United States.   Recounting Bush's remarks on Capitol Hill, White House presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``He just said he had felt we madethe right decisions when he reviewed the information involved, thathe had as good information as could be expected and that he wasconfident he did the right thing.   ``He said we were willing to use force but not ... unless weknow the circumstances and have better information.''   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., quoted Cheney and Powell as saying they``basically ... would not have changed their decision andrecommendations to the president, based on what they know today.''   While insisting that all of the administration's statementsabout the coup had been correct, Fitzwater withdrew an earlier onethat the United States had not been in direct contact in advancewith any coup leaders.   He confirmed that U.S. representatives had been in touch beforeTuesday with the coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi, who is believedto have been killed, perhaps by Noriega. Earlier, Fitzwater hadsaid that advance word had come through a third-party contact.   Fitzwater emphatically denied a report in The Wall StreetJournal that Giroldi's wife had tried to alert U.S. officials aboutthe coup three weeks ago. Similarly, Cheney said he had not heardthat kind of information.   Nevertheless, Cheney said, ``There are coup reports on a fairlyregular basis. That is not new.''   Fitzwater, during a briefing with reporters, offeredclarifications on several points:   _ The rebel forces asked, and the United States agreed, forAmerican forces to block access routes to Noriega's headquarters.Even so, Fitzwater said, ``We don't consider that participation inthe coup. We were not involved in the planning, in the operation,in the carrying it out.''   _ A cable transmitted to Washington by U.S. military officialsin Panama incorrectly stated that the rebels wanted the UnitedStates to take custody of Noriega. Fitzwater said the cable shouldhave said the rebels ``won't'' let the U.S. have custody.   Fitzwater said the erroneous cable never reached Bush. ``Therewas never a piece of information in this White House that saidanything other than they were not willing to give him up, period.''   Sen. Helms has repeatedly said he had information that therebels wanted to turn Noriega over to the United States. Fitzwatersaid Helms' staff was interviewed by White House chief of staffJohn Sununu and could not back up their claims.   _ Despite earlier suspicions, the United States now believesGiroldi was actually trying to overthrow Noriega. Earlier, Cheneyhad said U.S. officials feared ``a setup'' because Giroldi had beena Noriega confidant and had helped repel a coup attempt last year.   Fitzwater said that doubts about Giroldi ``were major factorsthat led to a concern that maybe the whole thing was a setup.''   Disputing The Wall Street Journal on another point, Fitzwaterdenied that the rebels had ever asked the United States to deploy ahelicopter to take Noriega into custody.</TEXT></DOC>
