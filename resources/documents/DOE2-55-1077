It has been possible to reduce theinput of capital, thanks to less expenditure on steel structures, shallowerfoundations and shorter assembly times. The new plants were commissionedwithout any undue teething troubles, and have been in permanent serviceever since. The operations are supervised by fewer personnel, consistingof qualified craftsmen. The computerised monitoring and control systemshave done well. This comment also applies to continuous process monitoring,which, in fact, is made easier by the small number of big preparationmachines. The new constructional design of preparation plants allowsthe replacement of entire machine units; maintenance and repair timecan thus be reduced to a minimum.</TEXT></DOC>
