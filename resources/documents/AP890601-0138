The move coincided with a demand by Prime Minister YitzhakShamir that the army adopt harsher measures to crush the nearly18-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel's occupation ofthe Gaza Strip and West Bank.   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, confirmed reports that theprime minister wants a tougher approach. ``If current measures arenot enough, we have to consider other measures,'' said Ahimeir.   At least 10 Palestinians, most of them teen-agers, were woundedtoday in clashes with troops in the occcupied lands, Arab hospitalofficials said.   Since the uprising began in December 1987, at least 503Palestinians have been killed, most of them by army gunfire.Twenty-two Israelis have also died in the violence.   In the West Bank city of Nablus, five Palestinians were shot andwounded when soldiers broke up a protest march by about 200chidlren. Troops chased marchers into the city's narrow alleyways,Arab reports said.   The protesters carried outlawed Palestinian flags and bannersreading: ``No alternative but the Palestinian state,'' the reportssaid.   In the Gaza Strip, five Palestinians were reported shot andwounded in clashes with soldiers.   An army official confirmed that five Palestinians were woundedin Nablus in what he described as clashes with stone-throwers. Hesaid he was checking reports of five wounded in Gaza.   Meanwhile, Jewish extremists waving Israeli flags and singingHebrew songs marched through Jerusalem's Arab sector under heavypolice guard today to mark the 22nd anniversary of Israel's captureof the area in the six-day war.   At one point in the march through the walled Old City, policefired tear gas at Arab youths after stones and a bottle weredropped from a rooftop, causing no injuries. Some of the marchershad pistols tucked into their belts.   Hundreds of Palestinians watched the procession silently. OneArab woman shouted ``Salam,'' or ``peace,'' to a Jewish woman, whoresponded with: ``Get out of here. This is our country.''   The Bank of Israel, meanwhile, said the uprising cost Israel$630 million in export losses last year, including $280 million inlost tourism.   The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted the bank's governor, MichaelBruno, as saying the uprising slowed economic growth and created aclimate of uncertainty that deterred foreign investment.   Also today, Israel rejected charges by the human rights groupAmnesty International that the army violated the rights ofnon-violent opponents of the occupation who are being detainedwithout trial in administrative detention.   More than 1,000 Palestinians are being detained without charges.   ``People are being held because of violent activities, notbecause of their ideas,'' said a Shamir aide, Avi Pazner. ``Israeldoes not use administrative detention lightly.''   In the Gaza Strip, the army launched a campaign today torestrict the entry of Palestinians to Israel.   Palestinians wishing to enter Israel must apply for plasticcards with a magnetic strip ``like the one you use in a bank,''said a senior military official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   He would not confirm or deny Israeli media reports the cardswould be run through a computer whenever Palestinians pass armycheckpoints separating Gaza and Israel.   Palestinians convicted of ``serious security or criminaloffenses'' will be denied the computerized identity cards, themilitary official said. He said he expected about 1,500 Gazaresidents would be refused them.   Women and children under the age 16 are exempt from the newrequirement and can continue to enter Israel with their oldIsraeli-issued identity cards, the official said.   He said he expected 70,000 to 80,000 Gazans to apply for the newcards, mainly so they can keep their jobs in Israel. At least50,000 Gazans work in Israel.   The cards are part of an army effort to ``improve our ability tosupervise and control entry from Gaza into Israel,'' the officialsaid, adding that similar cards might be introduced in the WestBank.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said such restrictions areintended to persuade Palestinians to accept Israel's peace plan,which calls for elections in the occupied lands. The PalestineLiberation Organization has rejected the plan because it does notprovide for eventual statehood.   The Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel has amended a decisionto issue tags reading ``alien worker'' to Arabs working in thecommunity of 8,000.   The introduction of the tags led to charges of racism, andraised comparisons with the yellow Star of David that Jews wereforced to wear in Nazi Germany.Under new regulations, all visitorsto Ariel, including Jews, must wear the tags, said Dorit Shalit, acity employee.</TEXT></DOC>
