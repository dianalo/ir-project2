The jump in oil prices and increased likelihood ofrecession in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait havegiven new ammunition to White House and industry lobbyistswho have attacked the bill's steep price tag. &quot;This soberingMiddle East crisis should cause everyone to re-evaluateAmerica's energy priorities and should raise grave concernsabout the new Clean Air Act,&quot; said Richard Seibert, vicepresident for resources and environment at the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers.</LP><TEXT>   The Bush administration estimates that the legislationwould impose annual costs of $25 billion on industry when itis fully phased in, with utilities and oil refiners -- andtheir customers -- among the hardest hit. The measure, whichis pending in a House-Senate conference committee, wouldimpose the nation's first controls on acid rain, curbcancer-causing emissions from factories and take a newapproach to cleaning up smog in all U.S. cities by 2010.   At the same time, however, powerful forces stand in theway of any effort to make wholesale changes in the measure.An attempt to substantively alter the measure would riskunraveling the series of carefully crafted compromises thatwas worked out over more than a year of negotiation. Withenactment -- and the congressional elections -- in sight, fewlawmakers are likely to be willing to take that risk.   Furthermore, the strength of the environmental movementremains a strong counterweight to any new push by business orthe White House to scale back the measure on cost or anyother grounds. &quot;The people who have argued against clean airfor a long time will use this recession argument against itnow,&quot; said Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. &quot;Butwith the deadlines in this bill, there will be plenty of timefor business to comply long after any recession is just amemory.&quot;   Most important, the impact of the Mideast instability isblunted because it can support many sides in the debate.Besides bolstering arguments for limiting the clean airbill's costs, it also helps people who want to use themeasure to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.Sometimes the two goals are at odds.   For example, both the Senate and House measures wouldforce the oil industry to begin selling cleaner-burningreformulated gasoline in some cities. The industry hascontended that the provisions would force them to closerefineries temporarily and could boost the price of gasolineas much as 15 cents a gallon in those cities. Both effectswould be particularly undesirable at a time when the economyis weak and gasoline prices are rising.   Over the longer term, though, replacement of gasoline withnon-gasoline additives -- as the provisions would require --could help reduce oil imports. Higher gasoline prices wouldpromote conservation.   Still, fears about the economy may well make a differencein the clean air debate, at least at the margins. They couldhelp bolster the less costly provision in areas, such asprovisions designed to reduce industrial smog emissions,where one house's bill is more stringent than the other.Industry also may be able to use the crisis to help push backeffective dates, such as deadlines for cleaning up autotailpipe emissions.   In addition, the Mideast crisis may boost small business'sefforts to win a softening of provisions that would imposeadditional requirements for permits and paperwork. Forenergy-intensive small businesses, &quot;it's almost a doublewhammy with clean air kicking in and the Iraqi situation,&quot;said Terry Hill, a spokesman for the National Federation ofIndependent Business.</TEXT></DOC>
