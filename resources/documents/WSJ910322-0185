The Sandamp;L refunding bill, passed by a 225-188 vote in theHouse, will allow the Resolution Trust Corp., the thriftcleanup agency, to continue to shut down insolvent thrifts.The agency hopes to recoup $48 billion of the $78 billionthrough the sale of assets from the failed thrifts. TheSenate passed the bill earlier this week, and President Bushis expected to sign it soon.</LP><TEXT>   But with the costly Sandamp;L refunding fresh in mind, theproposal by the administration to give banking regulatorsthree times the borrowing authority discussed just a dayearlier drew skeptical reaction on Capitol Hill and in theindustry.   Wednesday, a senior Treasury official proposed that theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. could borrow $25 billion fromthe Federal Reserve to cover projected bank losses. Theindustry would repay the loan through an increase in bankinsurance premiums.   But yesterday, officials proposed tripling the statedborrowing power. Robert Glauber, undersecretary of theTreasury, and William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, said theplan would also allow the FDIC to use its $5 billion line ofcredit with the Treasury as collateral to borrow anadditional $45 billion from the Treasury's Federal FinancingBank. That so-called working capital could finance assets offailed banks that are shut down and would be repaid chieflythrough the sale of those assets.   The bank insurance fund has steadily declined in recentyears, as bank failures have risen. In 1985, the fund had$1.19 to cover every $100 of deposits. Currently, the fundstands at 17 cents per $100 of deposits. If the fund runsdry, then taxpayers get the tab for protecting depositors infailed banks.   Some officials questioned whether leveraging the $5billion and also counting it as an asset on the FDIC's bookswasn't the same sort of fast-and-loose accounting that thriftregulators engaged in to stave off the taxpayer bailout ofthe Sandamp;L insurance fund. &quot;We are definitely playing fun withnumbers here,&quot; said Karen Shaw of the Institute for StrategyDevelopment, a Washington banking consultant.   Mark Riedy, president of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions, suggested it was a tactic to postponeacknowledging the extent of bank losses. &quot;Weren't we talkingabout $25 billion yesterday?&quot; he asked. &quot;I think we arebetter off if we identify how bad losses are right away, sowe can identify realistic options.&quot;   A senior Treasury official, however, said that the FDICcomplies with generally accepted accounting principles. Underthose rules, if the FDIC has to use its line of credit withthe Federal Reserve, it will have negative net worth, heconceded.   The administration officials characterized the newauthority being considered as a sort of emergency backup thatprobably wouldn't be needed. Mr. Seidman said his best guessfor bank losses through 1993 ranged from $30 billion to $35billion.   Either way, the taxpayer is the ultimate backup fordepositors at failed banks if the bank insurance fund runsout of money. &quot;The taxpayer is standing behind this, whetherit's the Treasury or the Federal Reserve&quot; that makes theloans, observed Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), the chairmanof the Senate Banking Committee.   The expanded funding plan is part of the Bushadministration's broad banking legislation that would alsoallow banks to engage in the sale of insurance and securitiesand allow commercial companies to own banks.   Even if the broader legislation to overhaul the bankingsystem dies, a narrower bill to recapitalize the bank fund isextremely likely this session. Congress may be uncomfortableapproving a plan that some view as less than perfect, butmembers are loath to allow a cash shortage to lead to costlydelays.   Mr. Glauber of the Treasury said the precarious health ofthe bank insurance fund is the best argument for a largebanking reform bill. &quot;The best way to get out of this box isto have fewer failures,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
