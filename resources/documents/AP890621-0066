The Israeli army said its air force jets attacked targets thatserve as the base for Ahmed Jibril, head of the pro-Syrian PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.   A spokesman for the Lebanese Civil Defense said rescuersevacuated eight wounded guerrillas from the targeted site _ woodedhills of Naameh overlooking the Mediterranean. The spokesman refusedto say which faction the guerrillas belonged to.   ``All planes returned safely, and the targets were damaged,'' theIsraeli army said in an announcement from Jerusalem. It made nomention of casualties.   It was Israel's ninth air attack into Lebanon this year and thesecond in a week.   On Friday, Israeli warplanes raided south Lebanon's RashidiyehPalestinian refugee camp. Police said two children were wounded inthe attack.   By police count, nine people have been killed and 60 wounded inthe previous eight Israeli air strikes, which began Jan. 11.   Jibril's group is headquartered in the Syrian capital, Damascus,and maintains bases in a chain of tunnels across the Naameh hills.   A police spokesman said four warplanes blasted the hilltoppositions in six runs spaced over one hour. Thick palls of dust andsmoke billowed from the stricken targets.   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Partymilitia also has bases in the hills, and his militiaman blocked allroads leading to Naameh, firing AK-47 assault rifles into the air toprevent reporters from passing checkpoints to the stricken area.   ``Civilians are not allowed into the area!'' shouted onemilitiaman as the raiding jets roared overhead.   Several Israeli gunboats were seen cruising the Mediterranean offNaameh.   Two Israeli helicopter gunships approached the coast, drawinganti-aircraft fire from Jumblatt's militia and Palestinianguerrillas, but no hits were observed.   The Palestinian guerrilla groups with bases in the area alsoinclude George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine; Nayef Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine and the Palestine Popular Struggle Front.   ``But it seems that the main target of the raid is the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,'' said aDruse militiaman.   Israeli air, naval and ground forces fought a nine-hour battlewith the faction in the Naameh hills on December 9. At least eightguerrillas and a ranking Israeli officer were killed.   Three Israeli soldiers and 16 guerrillas also were wounded in theDecember confrontation.   Jibril held a news conference at the tunnel base shortly afterthe December battle and said helicopter-borne Israeli paratroopershad released a number of Doberman pinschers fitted with tear gascontainers and explosives to chase his fighters across the tunnels.   Reporters saw five Dobermans killed by guerrillas. The dogs hadexplosives and gas containers strapped around their bellies.</TEXT></DOC>
