Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y.   Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., who lost part of a leg in Vietnam,said the administration ``isn't thinking through its Asian policyvery well. It is driven by the same lack of understanding that ledus to the bumbling mistakes of Vietnam.''   That argument, however, is rejected by administration officialsand what appears to be a majority in Congress.   ``Obviously there's a bitter legacy but it doesn't dictate ourpolicy,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke only oncondition of anonymity.   As a condition for establishing diplomatic relations withVietnam, for the first time since the fall of the U.S.-backedSaigon government in 1975, the Bush administration demanded an endto the 11-year Vietnamese military occupation of neighboringCambodia.   The Vietnamese say the last of their troops withdrew fromCambodia last month. But normalization of ties is stalled over themake-up of a new Cambodia government that the Bush administrationseeks to replace Hun Sen, installed by Vietnam and still in power.   The dispute over the Cambodian government, said the Bushadministration official, ``is not a new barrier we've erected toprotect ourselves from the specter of normalization'' with Vietnam.It is part of the package, he said.   Critics of administration policy say recognizing Vietnam wouldraise U.S. influence throughout the region.   ``We must, for our strategic and national interests, get back toVietnam'' to reassert U.S. influence in Southeast Asia, and competewith China, the Soviet Union and Japan, said Mrazek.   U.S. policy is still influenced by ``feelings of anger anddesire for revenge ... motives that ill suit a just and powerfulnation,'' said Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass.   At an international conference on Cambodia in Paris last July,Vietnam refused to support a proposal to include Cambodia's KhmerRouge guerrillas in an interim government that would be led byU.S.-backed opposition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.   The Khmer Rouge, who ruled Cambodia 1975-78, while in powerkilled an estimated 1 million compatriots in an effort to restorethe nation to a primitive agrarian society.   Khmer Rouge leaders, now fighting a guerrilla war in the junglesalong the Thai-Cambodian border, claim to have changed their ways,and have strong Chinese backing to be included as one of fourCambodian factions in a coalition government.   In Paris, the Vietnamese balked at including the Khmer Rouge,and are backing Hun Sen.   The United States accused Vietnam of intransigence, sayinginclusion of the militarily strong Khmer Rouge _ loathsome as itmay be _ is essential for achieving a negotiated settlement inCambodia. Such a settlement would include a halt of foreign armssupplies to all parties, an international monitoring force and freeelections.   ``In that context, the Khmer Rouge would be containable,'' saidthe senior administration official.   Mrazek and several other lawmakers argue that it is hypocriticalto criticize Vietnam for opposing the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge,and accuse the administration of backing a Khmer Rouge presence inan interim government for fear of antagonizing China.   Among the administration supporters on the issue is Sen. JohnMcCain, an Arizona Republican and former prisoner of war, who lastyear sponsored a bill to establish low-level diplomatic ties. Hewithdrew it when Vietnam suspended cooperation for several monthson the search for missing Americans.   ``No serious public official in this country will ever tell thefamilies of the ... Americans still missing in Vietnam that weintend to proceed with the improvement of relations absent anyrealistic expectation of Vietnamese cooperation in determining thefate of their fathers, husbands, sons and brothers,'' he said in arecent Washington Post opinion piece.   Vietnam in recent months has been providing more information onU.S. MIA's, and has been allowing Vietnamese formerly associatedwith Americans or fathered by U.S. servicemen to leave for theUnited States.   Yet Secretary of State James A. Baker III said several monthsago that ``the issue of missing American servicemen must first beresolved'' before official ties can be forged.   The administration says progress has been made in accounting forthe estimated 1,700 Americans missing in Vietnam. Another in aseries of U.S. official delegations of officials and forensicexperts is heading for Hanoi later this month.</TEXT></DOC>
