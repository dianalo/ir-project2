What would they look like if over 60%of the world's oil reserves were controlled by SaddamHussein?&quot;   Wrapping up three days of campaigning for President Bush,the vice president's wife says that if voters are &quot;upset withthe way things are going,&quot; it obviously can't be the fault ofa president who has already proved in the foreign arena howmuch he can accomplish. &quot;The message to be sent, the messagefor change, is to the Congress,&quot; she says.</LP><TEXT>   Voters in this economically stricken state are upset withthe way things are going. In fact, they are madder than hell:A recent poll by Sawyer-Miller Group found that anoverwhelming 82% of voters -- and 76% of Republicans --believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. So, forthe army of surrogate campaigners the administration hasunleashed in advance of the Feb. 18 primary, the goal issimple: Reroute that anger somewhere -- Saddam Hussein, TedKennedy, anywhere -- away from George Bush.   The task has taken on critical importance because of thechallenge posed to Mr. Bush by conservative televisioncommentator Patrick Buchanan. He has been blanketing thestate with eye-catching ads and a provocative message: thatPresident Bush has betrayed conservative values by raisingtaxes, doling out too much foreign aid and too often makingcommon cause with Democrats.   Polls in the state continue to show the president -- whois due here to campaign personally next week -- with a leadof better than 2 to 1. Bush strategists figure they caneffectively end the insurgent's challenge by drubbing himhere -- holding him to less than 30% of the vote.   But the Bush campaign's fear remains that many voterswhose support for the president is soft or who are undecided-- at least a quarter of the electorate -- will at the lastmoment cast a protest vote for Mr. Buchanan. Former Gov. HughGregg, an adviser to the president's campaign here, says hischief worry isn't the people who actually like Mr. Buchanan:&quot;I'm more worried about the Bush people who want to send amessage.&quot;   If Mr. Buchanan can win 35% to 40% here, it would give himample ammunition to continue his campaign further into theprimaries. The last two incumbent presidents who faced thatkind of sustained primary challenge -- in 1976 and in 1980 --were both defeated in November.   To avert that, the Bush surrogate campaign tailors itsmessage as much as possible to the conservative GOPelectorate here. Congress is blamed at every turn;campaigning yesterday, First Lady Barbara Bush said &quot;theeconomy will be great&quot; -- if only Congress would pass Mr.Bush's economic program. Heavy emphasis is placed onsurrogates with conservative credentials, such as VicePresident Dan Quayle, Housing and Urban Development SecretaryJack Kemp, former Education Secretary William Bennett, HouseMinority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Texas Sen. PhilGramm, all of whom have been here in recent days or arescheduled to come.   Several of these conservative stalwarts are being used notjust to tout Mr. Bush but also to go after Mr. Buchanan.&quot;Every moment Buchanan has to spend fighting for the rightwing is a moment he can't reach out for other voters,&quot; saysformer New Hampshire Attorney General Thomas Rath, a Bushcampaign adviser here.   To that end, the Bush campaign seeks to paint theconservative challenger as giving aid and comfort tocongressional liberals by weakening the president. People whovote for Mr. Buchanan &quot;might as well cast a vote for TedKennedy,&quot; says New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg, chairman of thepresident's campaign in the state and Hugh Gregg's son.   Some surrogates also have been willing to do what Mr. Bushhimself can't do, which is to attack the challenger directly.Rep. Gingrich, for example, gibed that Mr. Buchanan &quot;putsAmerica First except when he gets into his Mercedes.&quot; And Mr.Bennett assailed him as &quot;isolationist, protectionist . . .and xenophobic,&quot; likening him to George McGovern and the 19thcentury Know-Nothings.   Not all the surrogate Bush campaigners have been wildlyeffective. For example, former White House Chief of StaffJohn Sununu, another former New Hampshire governor, remainsunpopular here; his efforts at a Salem gathering last weekendto defend the president's 1990 budget-and-tax deal withCongress seem to have produced little more than severalcranky editorials in the ultraconservative Manchester UnionLeader.   Mr. Buchanan argues that all the surrogates in the worldcan't shore up Mr. Bush. &quot;If the president in the State ofthe Union address can't convince conservatives, sending upcabinet officers and others is not going to do the job,&quot; hesays after a well-attended appearance at Colby-Sawyer Collegein New London. &quot;This is between Pat Buchanan and GeorgeBush.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
