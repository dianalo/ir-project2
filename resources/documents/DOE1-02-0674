Sedimentation equilibrium experiments showed the recombinanterythropoietin preparation to be essentially a single macromolecularcomponent with a molecular weight of 30,400 and a carbohydrate contentof 39%. The Stokes radius of recombinant erythropoietin was estimatedto be 32 A from gel filtration, much larger than the 20-A radius calculatedfor a sphere of the observed molecular weight. This difference may beascribed to the extensive glycosylation. The fluorescence and phosphorescencespectra showed that the luminescent tryptophan(s) is (are) solvent-exposedand can be quenched by I{sup -} and acrylamide but not by Cs{sup +}.On acid titration, the recombinant erythropoietin showed a conformationaltransition with a midpoint of pH 4.1. This suggests that the net chargeson the protein moiety rather than on the whole molecule play a role inprotein structure stability.</TEXT></DOC>
