(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One day after hundreds of thousands ofpeople joined hands in the Baltic republics to call for freedom, theCommunist Party newspaper Pravda said Thursday the answer is notsecession but Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.   Describing the ``secessionist mood'' in Lithuania, Latvia andEstonia, Pravda asked: ``Is there an alternative to it?''   Yes, it answered, putting forward the party's reforms, championedby Gorbachev, that propose more independence to republics within theframework of the Soviet Union and call for the ``scrupulous andfriendly labor'' needed to implement them.   According to official media and local activists, more than 1million people stood hand-in-hand across the Baltic republics onWednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of a secret agreement betweenAdolf Hitler and Josef Stalin that put the then-independent nationsinto the Soviet orbit.   The gigantic protest, organized by grassroots groups in Estonia,Lithuania and Latvia, reflected activists' growing calls for fullindependence from Moscow instead of merely increased sovereignty.   ``I've never lived in an independent Lithuania,'' said graphicillustrator Audrius Ciocys, 30, as he stood in the line with hiswife and 3-year-old son. ``I believe there will be one _ for my sonthere must be.''   Edgar Savisaar, leader of the Estonian People's Front, said hebelieved the republic's parliament might decide as soon as Octoberto schedule a republic-wide referendum on independence.   Faced by a protest of such astonishing scale, the Sovietgovernment's position seemed to be that the demonstration's aimswere so vague that the turnout could not be seen as a wholesaleendorsement of Baltic nationalists' demands for independence.   ``There's a varied picture there,'' Foreign Ministry spokesmanYuri A. Gremitskikh told a regular news briefing in Moscow. ``Someprominent political figures yesterday in the Baltic republics saidthey thought that issues that are raised should be resolved bypolitical means, and I believe we could quite agree with thatopinion.''   In its coverage of the Baltic protest, the Soviet governmentdaily Izvestia gave a sympathetic account of the formation of the``human chain,'' but condemned other demonstrations by harder-linegroups that, for example, in Vilnius, Lithuania, bore signs linkingthe Nazi swastika with the Soviet hammer and sickle.   On Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe intospheres of influence and less than a year later Stalin annexed theBaltic states.   Moscow Radio on Wednesday quoted a Moscow's historian's``dismissal as unlawful'' any attempts to claim that the Soviet holdon the Baltic states is invalid because it stems from the 1939 pact.   Gremitskikh told reporters the Soviet Union is not the onlycountry with a stake in Baltic tranquility.   ``If you rock the multinational Soviet boat, at the same time yourock the common European boat, and you know quite well by now thatwe live in a very closely knit and interdependent world,'' theForeign Ministry spokesman said. ``The stability of any individualstate is just part of the general stability.''   Official estimates provided by the Tass news agency said 500,000people turned out for the protest in Lithuania, a republic of 3.7million people, and that 300,000 of Estonia's 1.6 million peopletook part.   There was no official estimate from Latvia, but the People'sFront grassroots organization in Riga estimated that 400,000 peopleturned out there.   Moscow activists tried to organize a sympathy protest, but policeand a special anti-demonstration unit broke it up. Tass said 75people were detained.   In the southwestern Soviet republic of Moldavia, also annexed bythe Soviet Union under the secret agreement, about 10,000 peopleattended an outdoor rally in heavy rain, activists reported.</TEXT></DOC>
