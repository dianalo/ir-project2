With the down-and-dirty Democratic primary runoff over, bothnominees for governor pledged to stick to an issue-oriented debate.   Republicans already were casting the race as a struggle betweenconservatives and liberals. Democrats expect Ms. Richards, anoutspoken abortion rights advocate, to draw intense support fromwomen.   Williams, 58, the oilman-rancher nicknamed ``Claytie,'' won theRepublican primary without a runoff last month in an $8 millioncampaign. He says he'll bring to government the same managementstyle that made him a multimillionaire in business.   Ms. Richards, 56, who became an overnight celebrity after herno-holds-barred oratory at the 1988 Democratic National Convention,had a bruising runoff Tuesday against state Attorney General JimMattox but retains her ``star'' status and brings voters aneight-year record of managing the state treasury.   There was little discussion of the issues before the runoff, inwhich Mattox alleged that Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic,used illegal drugs, including cocaine, 10 years ago when she was aTravis County commissioner.   ``She's somebody who can make state government work,'' said EdMartin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. ``She'snot the guy who has an $8 million mask and wants to take us back tothe thrilling days of yesteryear.''   But Texas GOP Chairman Fred Meyer characterized thegubernatorial race as ``a clear choice between a national liberalDemocrat and a moderate-to-conservative Republican, ClaytieWilliams ... that's exactly the kind of matchup we like in Texas.''   Ms. Richards strongly supports abortion rights; Williams hassaid he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or dangerto a mother's life.   The abortion issue also could figure prominently in the U.S.Senate race in which Democratic nominee Hugh Parmer already isairing television commercials attacking incumbent Republican Sen.Phil Gramm.   Abortion-rights advocate Parmer has been sharply critical oflegislation Gramm introduced in Congress to restrict abortions. Aformer Fort Worth mayor and current state senator, Parmer won thenomination last month, as did Gramm.   Gramm, who overpowered Democrat Lloyd Doggett in 1984, has saidhe is prepared to spend up to $20 million to hold onto his seat.   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown said his party will pulltogether to hold power in the nation's third-largest state.   ``Ann Richards is ready to lead modern Texas into a new decadeand a new century. The Texas of tomorrow can ill-afford theprehistoric notions of Clayton Williams,'' Brown said. ``Together,we can make 1990 the stepping stone to a Democratic White House in1992.''   Incumbent Republican Gov. Bill Clements, 72, is not seekingre-election.</TEXT></DOC>
