Traders couldn't cite any specific news to account for therally, which lifted the Nasdaq Composite Index to a gain of4.92, or 1%, at 498.27. Strong advances on the New York StockExchange, though, added to the positive sentiment, they said.</LP><TEXT>   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.79, or0.85%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved above the3000 level with a gain of 31.08, or 1.04%.   Advancing Nasdaq issues outnumbered decliners, 1,088 to788, as trading sprang back to life. National Market Systemvolume swelled to 123,630,000 shares from 89,060,000 Monday.   Among the most active stocks were two new issues. MonroMuffler Brake closed at 16 1/2, up from an offering price of16, on volume of 1.4 million shares. Progress Software,meanwhile, soared to 29 1/2, up 18% from its $25-a-sharepricing, on volume of 1.3 million shares.   Traders said activity was dominated by institutions andmarket makers. E.E. Geduld, president of Herzog Heine GeduldInc., said he saw institutions &quot;just adding to positions.&quot;   Robert O'Toole Sr., head of OTC institutional sales atLehman Brothers, said institutions &quot;are not knocking down thedoors, but there are good solid bids here, and there are nosellers.&quot;   In addition, traders said the rising market forced someinvestors to buy to cover short, or oversold, positions.   Participation by individual investors, meanwhile, remainedmore sparse. John Giesea, manager of OTC trading at AdvestInc., said, &quot;My sense is that we have quite a bit of investorapathy or confusion, which results in inactivity&quot; amongindividuals.   Traders said they expect yesterday's momentum to push OTCstocks still higher this week. &quot;I think the market has a goodfeel to it, and I think {it} can carry forward,&quot; Advest's Mr.Giesea said.   Said Lehman Brothers' Mr. O'Toole: &quot;It looks like thebeginning of a nice little rally here. Unless we get some badnews, we are going to continue on the upside for a couple ofdays.&quot;   Herzog Heine's Mr. Geduld, though, cautioned that althoughthe market may continue higher, it could just as easilyreverse course. &quot;The markets are very volatile these days,&quot;he said.   Meanwhile, the underwriter for Progress Software's initialpublic offering said there was sufficient demand to sell evenmore than the 1.2 million shares in yesterday'salready-expanded issue. The issue had been expected to totalone million shares priced at $20 to $22 each.   &quot;We could have sold twice as much as we did, three timesas much, easily,&quot; said Ken Fitzsimmons, a managing partner atRobertson Stephens andamp; Co., lead underwriter. He said thestrong market conditions helped the stock exceed hisperformance target. He said he was expecting the stock toclose at 10% to 15% above its pricing level.   Chad Carpenter, Progress Software's senior vice president,sales and services, wouldn't comment on the offering'spricing. In its prospectus, the company said it hopes toraise additional capital through the stock market in thefuture.   Mr. Carpenter said Progress, which provides a computerlanguage and database used by applications softwaredevelopers, expects the proceeds from yesterday's offeringplus existing cash and funds generated by operations to meetits needs through the end of its next fiscal year on Nov. 30,1992.   Progress expects proceeds of about $13 million from theoffering. That amount will be increased by about $5 millionif the underwriters exercise their overallotment option.Proceeds are to be used for working capital and possibleacquisitions, though the company said no purchases arecurrently under negotiation.   Elsewhere, Valley Capital jumped 4 1/4 to 28 1/4 after theLas Vegas-based bank holding company said it is in talks fora possible sale of the corporation. It didn't identify apotential acquirer.
