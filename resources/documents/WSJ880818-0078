A spokesman for Panhandle said the Houston-based pipeline concern will appeal the ruling. A Maritime Administration spokesman declined to comment, citing the appeal.    The suit, filed in April 1987 by the U.S. Justice Department on behalf of the maritime agency, charges Panhandle's Lachmar Shipping unit with defaulting on payment on Maritime Administration-guaranteed loans used to construct two tankers to carry liquefied natural gas from Algeria to the U.S. The debt totals about $138 million, roughly the amount the Justice Department said it plans to ask for when it files a final affidavit for damages later this month.    Panhandle argued that falling prices and other industry changes &quot;forced&quot; the 1983 suspension of a 20-year contract between Sonatrach, the Algerian government's gas concern, and Trunkline Gas Co., a Panhandle unit making shipping payments to Lachmar. The spokesman said the contract called for Trunkline to purchase 3.3 trillion cubic feet of gas over 20 years for a delivery cost of about $7 a thousand cubic feet. At the time of suspension, domestic natural gas could be delivered at an average cost of $2 to $5 for each thousand cubic feet.    The market changes, argued Panhandle, &quot;served to excuse&quot; Trunkline from making certain payments to the Lachmar unit. Those payments had been assigned to the Maritime Administration as partial security for its loan guarantees on the tankers.    The two tankers, idling at Newport News, Va., since 1983, have since been repossessed by the government. The Lachmar tankers completed 11 voyages between Algeria and the U.S. Panhandle settled the remainder of its natural-gas contract with Sonatrach for $200 million in cash and 7.5 million, now about 13%, of Panhandle common shares.    Separately, Panhandle said that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismissed all allegations of imprudence regarding the natural gas purchasing and contracting practices of another Panhandle unit, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. In 1984, distribution companies and consumers charged refunds were called for because the gas purchase practices of the Panhandle unit weren't prudent.    A company vice president praised the decision, noting that the federal regulators reviewed the case &quot;in light of circumstances that existed when decisions were made rather than on the basis of later developments.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
