The contract, which has long been expected, calls forGeneral Dynamics to supply a total of 315 next-generation M-1tanks to the Saudis from 1993 through 1995. General Dynamicswill also supply support equipment, spare parts, trainingfacilities and munitions.</LP><TEXT>   Along with a 550-tank co-production agreement with Egypt,negotiated last year, General Dynamics has moved asignificant step closer to guaranteeing that its assemblyplant in Lima, Ohio, stays open. Success there for thecompany would mean, in turn, that its machining shop inWarren, Mich., also would avoid being shut. General Dynamics,the Pentagon's No. 2 supplier and the U.S.'s only tankmanufacturer, has said it needs to produce the M-1 at a rateof at least 360 a year to ensure that one of its two tankassembly lines can survive.   General Dynamics has been producing 720 M-1s a year,accounting for nearly 10% of the St. Louis-based company's$10 billion in sales in 1989.   As part of the Bush administration's 1991 budget, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney has called for ending purchases of M-1tanks for the Army next year. But to cushion that blow andgive General Dynamics additional time to try to find othercustomers, Mr. Cheney has stressed that the Pentagon'sproposal envisions filling the entire Saudi order.   &quot;We have no illusions about our tank business,&quot; a companyofficial said yesterday. &quot;But even modest production would bebetter than shutting things down entirely.&quot; General Dynamicsemploys about 2,600 in Ohio and 1,200 in Michigan on the M-1program.   Robert Truxell, general manager of General Dynamics' LandSystems Division, yesterday called the pact with the Saudis&quot;particularly important.&quot;   &quot;At a time of declining U.S. requirements, internationalsales will play a key role in our efforts&quot; to maintain M-1sales in the 1990s, he said.   Indeed, while the Saudi transaction still leaves GeneralDynamics some 150 tanks short of its minimum annualproduction goal -- not including any direct sales to thePentagon that may be restored on Capitol Hill -- the signingof the accord could pave the way for other sales abroad. &quot;Wecould see a snowball effect,&quot; predicted Rep. Mike Oxley (R.,Ohio).   At present, General Dynamics is pitching the Abrams tankto the United Arab Emirates, Sweden, Kuwait, Pakistan andCanada. In addition, the British are expected to decide bythe end of the year if they want the M-1 to replace theiraging fleet of Chieftain tanks.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,General Dynamics shares closed up 87.5 cents at $33.</TEXT></DOC>
