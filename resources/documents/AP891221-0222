But the computer company says it hopes tochange its image by making equipment that uses popular,industrywide standards.   ``We're focusing more and more on our customers,'' said GerryPaul, Wang's vice president of systems, research and development.``What they want is a wide variety of applications of software.''   Analysts said the strategy, announced Wednesday, marks animportant departure for Wang, and it follows a recent trend inwhich computer companies have been making equipment that iscompatible across the industry.   ``Wang traditionally has been a closed, proprietary equipmentcompany,'' said Steven Wendler, an analyst with Gartner Group Inc.``For a company like Wang, this movement into open systems is avery significant philosophical change.''   Wang said the announcement was part of a general strategyoutlined by company President Richard Miller last month, in whichthe Lowell-based firm is trying to pay closer attention to theneeds of its customers.   In a statement Wednesday, Miller said that by ``adoptingopenness both as a product strategy and a state of mind, andconstantly listening to and heeding our customers' directions, Wangwill succeed in its efforts to grow and remain competitive in the1990s and beyond.''   Wang's strategy calls for integrating standardized technologiesinto its existing product lines and developing new sets of hardwareand software based on popular industry standards such as UNIX andDOS.   For the past two years, Wang has been making personal computersthat are compatible with equipment from industry leaderInternational Business Machines Corp., Paul said.   But, he added, ``We didn't move as quickly as we should have inopening up our products.''   Wang posted a loss of $62.1 million in the quarter that endedSept. 30. As part of the company's new focus, Miller announced lastmonth that Wang would cut 2,000 jobs, in addition to about 5,000jobs that were eliminated earlier in the year.   Part of Wang's rebuilding strategy has been to develop so-calledimaging systems, in which documents such as payroll forms orinsurance claims are electronically ``scanned'' and stored in acomputer.   The documents can be retrieved on a computer screen much as aVCR reproduces the images of a movie. The technology is aimed atreducing the time and cost associated with manually filing,collating and retrieving documents.   Wang said its focus on openness is being blended with theimaging technology to ``enable the broadest possible range ofusers'' to take advantage of the product.   Wang said it hoped to further broaden the use of imaging systemsthrough a licensing agreement, also announced Wednesday, withNovell Inc., a Provo, Utah, company that makes personal computernetworking systems.   ``Our goal is to provide universal access to Wang imaging andintegration of information and applications,'' Miller said.   But while Wang continues to build its market in imageprocessing, more important is the company's movement away from itsproprietary systems, Wendler said.   In the next four years, he said, the image processing market isexpected to grow to $3 billion, but open system technologies areexpected to represent a $60 billion market.   ``The prospects for image processing are bright,'' he said,``but the prospects for open systems are much brighter.''   Wang also said Wednesday it had reached an agreement to sell upto 30 percent of the shares it holds in its Taiwan manufacturingsubsidiary. The buyer was not announced. Wang said the sale of afull 30 percent of the shares would bring it about $120 millionafter taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
