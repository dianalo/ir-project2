By the year 2000, theU.S. will be a far more pluralistic country than anyone wouldhave imagined in 1950 -- and vastly more pluralistic than itwas in 1783, when Yale President Ezra Stiles pictured afuture America divided about equally amongCongregationalists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians.   The big story is the continuing, long-time decline of theProtestant majority, to 57% in 1987 from 67% in 1952. At thepresent rate of decline, Protestants will be barely anumerical majority of the American population by the year2000.</LP><TEXT>   Not all Protestant denominations are declining equallyfast. Since the middle-1960s, Methodists have declined to 9%from 14%, Lutherans to 6% from 7%, Presbyterians to 3% from6% and Episcopalians to 2% from 3%. Mainline Protestantlosses have been largely among the young who have eitherturned to other faiths, or simply dropped out of religiousinstitutions entirely.   The only large Protestant denomination to remain stable isthe Baptists, due mainly to the staying power of theevangelicals and fundamentalists within the ranks of theSouthern Baptists. Along with Southern Baptists, otherconservative Protestant groups, such as the Assemblies ofGod, the Seventh-Day Adventists and various Pentecostal andholiness groups, continue to flourish. Three in 10 Americansare evangelicals, or born-again Christians. Enthusiasm,certainty of belief, moral passion, and institutionalcommitment -- all are attributes that engender evangelicalgrowth and vitality. But not to be overlooked are thedemographics.   Conservative Protestants hold on to their young muchbetter than mainline Protestants. Young conservativeProtestants are less likely to quit their parents' faith;perhaps most important of all, conservative Protestants havemore young in the first place -- birth rates for evangelicalsand fundamentalists are significantly higher than for moreliberal Protestants.   The mainline churches are also having trouble maintainingtheir distinctiveness. Denominational lines are blurringamong them, while distinctions among the conservatives --such as evangelical, fundamentalist, holiness, Pentecostaland charismatic -- have taken on new meaning.   Roman Catholicism has grown in almost the same proportionas Protestantism has declined: to 28% of the nation'spopulation from 25% over the past 30 years. Historically,Catholics have had a higher birth rate than Protestants, butthe gap has narrowed in recent decades. A more importantfactor accounting for Catholic growth is the immigration ofHispanics, who make up 17% of all American Catholics. BecauseHispanics have a higher birth rate than other Catholics, wecan expect their presence within American Catholicism tobecome even larger. But Hispanics are also being recruitedinto Protestantism, especially evangelical Protestantism, inrecord numbers: 18% of Hispanics now belong to Protestantdenominations.   Jews as a proportion of the American population havedeclined since mid-century -- to 2% from 4%. This shiftlargely is a result of two factors: a low birth rate and ahigh rate of interfaith marriage. The Jewish proportion hasheld steady at 2% since the early 1970s, which may indicate astable pattern for the foreseeable future.   Two groupings have grown more rapidly over the past 40years than any others: &quot;other religions&quot; and thedisaffiliated. &quot;Other religions&quot; include a broad array ofgroups, some that have long been present on the Americanscene, such as the Greek and Russian Orthodox, who havedwindled as a proportion of the total population from 2% in1950 to less than 1% today. Other groups that have long beenpresent have grown enormously since World War II, such as theMormons and Jehovah's Witnesses.   Perhaps the fastest-growing religious faith, though, isIslam. There are now roughly as many Moslems in the U.S. asthere are Episcopalians. There are also large numbers ofBuddhists in America's cities, especially Los Angeles, as aresult of heavy emigration from Asia in the past two decades.Hundreds of religious and spiritual groups new to theAmerican scene have emerged: Eastern mystical faiths, with anemphasis on meditation and reincarnation as well as groupsdrawing upon a wide assortment of older, more primitivetraditions recast in new form, such as nature religions,Native American practices, theosophical beliefs, goddessworship and other New Age spiritualities. Today 4% of thepopulation claims a religion outside the major traditions. Inthe 1950s, only 1% did.   The religiously nonaffiliated have grown to 9% today from2% in the early 1950s. As their numbers have increased, theircultural characteristics have changed: No longer a smallmarginal group of atheists and social dissidents,nonaffiliates today are predominately young, white,well-educated and socially mobile.   Many within this group have dropped out from the mainlineProtestant and Catholic churches. They are perhaps betterdescribed as privately religious than as irreligious oranti-religious. The rise of this sector points not only to agrowing secular constituency but also to the greater easegenerally with which Americans move in and out of religiousaffiliations.   In the next decade, we can expect an increasinglypluralistic religious environment. The great divide betweenreligious liberals and religious conservatives within majorreligious communities will persist and maybe even intensifyover issues such as abortion.   We can expect the boundaries of &quot;conventional&quot; religion tocontinue to expand: Faiths once thought of as foreign, suchas Buddhism and Islam, will take their place in the canopy ofAmerican religious pluralism.   We can also expect greater religious voluntarism: Peoplewill pick and choose beliefs and practices from the variousreligions, creating their own synthesized versions, makingfor more personal, individualistic styles of faith.   ---   Mr. Roof is a professor of religion at the University ofCalifornia, Santa Barbara.   ---             Religious Affiliations of Americans                                                                                                                          1952    1957    1972    1980    1987                                                                                                        Protestant         67%     66%     63%     61%     57%                                                                                                        Catholic           25      26      26      28      28                                                                                                        Jewish              4       3       2       2       2                                                                                                        Other               1       1       2       2       4                                                                                                        None                2       3       5       7       9                                                                                                        Source: Gallup Data</TEXT></DOC>
