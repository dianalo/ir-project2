 A sampling from the beta-test sites for theOS/2 version of KBMS, slated for delivery by the end of the month, includesapplications for insurance underwriting, sales forecasting and marketinganalysis.andM;Unlike most expert systems, which reside either in the PC or the mainframeworld, AI Corp.'s KBMS family bridges both environments by providing anequivalent system on both platforms, Harris said.andP;  The new OS/2 versions ofKBMS and Intellect are identical in function to their mainframe counterparts,so users can develop an expert system on the PC and run it unchanged on anIBM mainframe, he added.andM;''With KBMS and Intellect, AI Corp. provides a seamless way to run an expertsystem up and down the IBM environment,'' said Harvey Newquist, publisher ofAI Trends, a newsletter on artificial intelligence based in Scottsdale, Ariz.andO;''No other company provides that kind of solution today, not even IBM.''andM;Another major advantage of KBMS is that AI Corp. designed it to be integratedwith corporate data, not as a stand-alone expert system, said TracyLicklider, head of the firm's OS/2 development effort.andM;''The problem with expert systems has been that there was no way to marry thetechnology with the corporate data stashed on an IBM mainframe,'' Licklidersaid.andP;  ''We saw an opportunity in the marketplace to deliver technology thatmakes a close coupling between the expert system and core corporate data.''andM;The mainframe version of KBMS can be purchased with a variety of interfacesthat enable it to access data in popular mainframe databases, including IBM'sDB2 and Information Builders Inc.'s Focus, he explained.andP;  The OS/2 versionmust be used in tandem with the mainframe release to access mainframe data,Licklider added.andM;KBMS's link to corporate data was the main appeal for UNUM Life Insurance Co.andO;in Portland, Maine, according to John Roberts, the firm's vice president ofresearch and technology and a tester of KBMS for OS/2.andM;''We were not looking for an isolated application just on OS/2,'' he said.andO;''In most cases, we wanted to run the expert system in both environments,accessing mainframe databases.''andM;UNUM's pilot application for KBMS is an insurance underwriting programdesigned to raise the level of expertise of its underwriters, Roberts said.andO;The system helps employees make decisions on such matters as acceptingapplicants for group risk and structuring a contract, he said.andM;''Our expert systems are geared toward improving the quality of our decisionmaking, which, in the long run, impacts our bottom line,'' Roberts said.andM;The OS/2 version of KBMS with Intellect, which requires 4M bytes to 6M bytesof memory, will be priced at $9,500.andP;  Intellect lets users access data in avariety of mainframe databases using simple English phrases.andM;AI Corp. is also planning to release a scaled-down version of KBMS andIntellect to run on the prevailing installed base of PCs that run DOS, Harrissaid, although he declined to name a specific release date.andP;  A version forOS/2 1.1 with the Presentation Manager graphical user interface is alsoslated for release by the second half of the year, Harris said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
