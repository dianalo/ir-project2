(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Since its inception last October, the PC Week Poll of Corporate Satisfactionhas explored and quantified corporate volume-buying influences andpreferences on a variety of PC products.andP;  After taking the pulse ofproduct-specific purchasing for nine months, it's only natural that adiagnosis of sorts be delivered.andM;This week, polls about systems-level hardware are dissected.andP;  Hardwareperipherals will be the focus next week.andP;  (Trends in software were exploredlast week.)andM;Although the Polls about systems-level hardware have covered a range ofproducts running at various speeds, the results have been remarkablyconsistent: In six Polls, compatibility was named the most importantpurchasing trait; in another, compatibility tied with reliability as beingmost significant to buyers; and in the remaining two systems-level hardwarePolls, reliability edged out compatibility by just two to three points.andM;In all, nine Polls on particular types of systems hardware have beenconducted.andP;  Desktop systems examined included 8MHz, 10MHz and 12MHz 286 PCs,along with a follow-up six months later focusing on 12MHz 286 PC buyinghabits, and 16MHz 386 PCs, with a Poll on 20MHz 386s six months later.andP;  APoll on 286 accelerator boards was also conducted.andM;In addition, the PC Week Poll turned the spotlight on portable and laptopcomputers, surveying buyers of laptops under 15 pounds, followed by Polls on8086 and 8088 laptops, 286-based laptops and portables, and 386-based laptopsand portables.andM;Performance Not Top DrawandM;Despite the common assumption that system performance is the key purchasinghook for buyers of high-powered desktops, in each Poll, performance wasoutranked by reliability and compatibility.andM;However, its placement shifted with processing speed, and over time.andP;  In theinitial Poll on 286 PCs, which did not limit system participation to aspecific processing speed, performance was ranked fifth in importance, wellbehind top-placed compatibility and second-ranked reliability.andM;In the first Poll on 386 PCs, which covered powerhouses running at 16MHz,performance was a distant third, behind compatibility and reliability, whichtied for the top spot.andM;Interestingly, when 286 (12MHz) and 386 (20MHz) desktops were again the focusof a PC Week Poll six months later, purchasing priorities had shifted: Thoughagain ranked third behind compatibility and overall reliability, performancereceived a raw score as much as 13 points higher from buyers, bringing itmuch closer in ranking, and thus in importance, to the top-ranked duo.andM;This makes sense, given those PCs' higher megahertz ratings.andM;A system's value relative to its cost is not taken into consideration bybuyers as much as one might assume.andP;  In the second round of Polls on 286 and386 PCs, this trait placed sixth in importance, behind vendor support.andM;In the first surveys conducted on 286 and 386 desktops, buyers were askedabout price relative to similarly equipped PCs; 16MHz 386 PC volume buyersrelegated this attribute to next-to-last place.andM;Corporate buyers of 8MHz, 10MHz and 12MHz 286 PCs, in contrast, placedrelative price in a tie with vendor support in importance, suggesting thatthe purchase of such products was based more on economics at that time thanwas true six months later.andM;286 Acceleration Isn'tandM;Despite the trend toward &quot;speed greed,&quot; the majority of those who have boughtaccelerator boards to increase the processing power of 8088- and 8086-basedsystems to 286 levels are more concerned with replacing older desktops withtheir zippier brethren (or swapping out the motherboard) than with souping upyesterday's technology.andM;Interestingly, performance was ranked last in importance when selecting 286accelerator boards; buyers maintained that they assume performance to beequivalent among different boards.andM;Moveable Beasts?andM;Respondents to the PC Week Polls on laptops weighing less than 15 lbs.,andO;8088/8086-based laptops, 286-based laptops/portables and 386-basedlaptops/portables all ranked compatibility as paramount in brand selection.andO;Buyers of 286-based laptops/portables tied that trait with reliability; inthe other Polls on luggable systems, reliability slid to the No.andP;  2 slot bytwo to four points.andM;This ranking makes sense: Laptop buyers must concern themselves more withwhether their users can run whatever software is needed than with ensuringconsistent operation at all times.andM;Taking the laptop Polls as a group, one attribute in particular deservesattention: display quality.andP;  This attribute came in either second -- tyingwith reliability -- or third in significance to volume purchasers, far abovekeyboard quality and relative value.andM;However, though high-end laptops came the closest to meeting buyers' desiresin screen legibility, the average of individual 286- and 386-based laptopscores in display quality fell almost 10 points short of that trait's overallscore of importance.andP;  And the average display-quality score of 8088 and 8086laptops was a whopping 20 points shy of the rating buyers of such laptopsgave to display quality as an attribute.andM;No other laptop trait fell so far short of what buyers expect, paving a clearpath -- improved display legibility -- by which a laptop/portable vendorpresumably can win buyers' hearts.andM;The results of the Polls on 286 and 386 desktop PCs were the most surprisingof the systems-level Polls: Firms that purvey PC products by mail capturedtop overall honors, with systems from Dell Computer Corp. and PC's Limitedoutscoring those from such big-name systems houses as Compaq Computer Corp.,andO;IBM, Zenith Data Systems and Hewlett-Packard Co.andP;  In fact, buyers ofmail-order PCs awarded those products the highest scores in vendor support,overturning the belief that mail-order systems fall far short of theirblue-chip kin in that area.andM;Taken as a whole, the PC Week Polls on systems-level hardware stronglysuggest that vendors should pay more than nominal attention to supportconcerns -- and with laptops, provide better display quality -- if buyersatisfaction is important to them.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
