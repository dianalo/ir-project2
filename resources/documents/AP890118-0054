Police in the southern provincial city said about 50 studentsrushed into the compound yelling anti-American slogans and threwstones and about 50 firebombs. They said about 15 protesters climbedonto the roof and tried to start a fire.   ``Drive out Yankee imperialists,'' attackers chanted during theattack in the city 180 miles south of Seoul.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Seoul said no one was injured in theattack and the protesters did not get inside the cultural center. Hesaid 30 windows were broken, one official vehicle was damaged andtiles were ripped from the roof when attackers tried to set thebuilding on fire.   Parts of the building and a police post were damaged byfirebombs, the U.S. spokesman said.   At least one U.S. official was in the building at the time, butthe staff locked the doors and waited to be rescued, the spokesmansaid. The police who routinely guard the building were too few tostop the attack, he said.   Riot police drove the attackers off with tear gas and arrestedtwo who had scaled the roof and were shouting slogans through abullhorn, police officials said. The other attackers fled, they said.   The attackers also denounced President Roh Tae-woo, chanting,``Down with Roh Tae-woo.''   The attackers unfurled a banner on the roof saying, ``Punish RohTae-woo and the Yankees, the enemies of our nation.''   About 100 other students watched and applauded the attackers, butdid not take part and were dispersed when riot police arrived, theofficials said.   Police said the attackers were from Chonnam University in Kwangju.   The attack came shortly after about 200 students battled riotpolice with firebombs at Chosun University in Kwangju, police said.Riot police fired tear gas to disperse the radicals in thatincident, they said.   The Kwangju center is operated by the U.S. Information Service tosponsor cultural activities and serve as an information center forthe United States. It provides a library and other facilities toresidents.   The incident came the day after Roh told a nationally televisednews conference that U.S. troops must remain in the country untilpeace is achieved with communist North Korea.   Radical students have staged a series of attacks on U.S.diplomatic buildings in recent months, demanding an end to Americaninfluence in South Korea and withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troopsbased in the nation under a mutual defense treaty.   The radicals, who have little public support, claim the UnitedStates has backed military rule in South Korea and Washington keepstroops in the south to block unification with North Korea.   U.S. officials have said American forces will remain in SouthKorea as long as their presence is deemed necessary by South Koreanleaders.   American forces have been based in the country since the UnitedStates intervened to help the south against the North Koreaninvasion that triggered the 1950-53 Korean War.</TEXT></DOC>
