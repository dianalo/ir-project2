 Typically, wecomplain about the flaws in others that we are reluctant to correct inourselves.andP;  In a sense, complaints may be indirect confessions.andM;But once a year, our culture has the tradition of listing those actions weknow we need to take in the coming yea to improve our lives.andP;  For afleetingmoment we take stock and resolve to do better.andM;We promise to exercise more, eat more carefully, spend more time with ourloved ones and donate our time and money to numerous worthy causes.andP;  Unlesswe immobilize ourselves with guilt, this can be a valuable exercise.andM;Here  are my recommendations for your IRM new year's resolutions.andP;  Some aredaunting; others are small.andP;  However, each would make us more effective asindividuals and as a profession.andM;* When I am about to complain, I resolve to examine what I can do, howeversmall, to change the situation or behavior that irks me.andP;  This is useful, iffor  no other reason, because it insulates my peace of mind from the nonsenseof others.andM;* I promise to speak respectfully of all my colleagues, wheter or not I likethem or approve of them.andP;  Like complainst, putdowns of other characters samore about my character.andM;* I will seek to conduct my professional life as if it were under constantpublic scrutiny.andP;  I will consider my actions as if they were to appear on thefront page of GCN or the Federal Page of the Washington Post.andM;* I pledge to follows &quot;full-and-open competition&quot; in my procurement actions,regardless of their magnitude.andP;  I will select the vendor that does the bestjob of meeting my needs, rather than the vendor that is most convenient orvisible.andM;* I will state my requirements in terms of functional specifications.andP;  I willdescribe the results the contractor is to achieve rather than how he is toaccomplish them.andP;  I will avoid choosing solutions before giving the vendorsthe opportunity to understand the problem we want them to solve.andM;* I will understand and adhere to the Federal Information ProcessingStandards as they apply to my acquisitios and system development efforts.andP;  Inparticular, I will adopt the Application Portability Profile as my opensystems blueprint for achieving competition and technology upgrades.andM;* I will learn the mission and program of my agency so that the systems I amresponsible for can best satisfy these ends.andP;  I will refrain from usingtechnobable in the presence of end users and program managers.andM;* I will state the costs and benefits for information systems development interms of business of my agency, not the technology either current orproposed.andP;  I will articulate technology plans as means for meeting programobjectives rather than as ends in themselves.andM;* I will do my best to keep up with IRM technologies.andP;  Although technologicalcurrency is a full-time job, each of us needs to indulge our curiousity.andO;Otherwise, we will become barriers to rather than agents of change.andM;* I will remember that wisdom is not the exclusive faculty of seniormanagement.andP;  Every member of the organization has the potential to makesignificant contributions; let me not be an impediment simply because I&quot;outrank&quot; them.andP;  If total quality management is to secceed, we all mustparticipate.andM;* I will start a thorough filing system for my office.andP;  This systemwillmaintain and protect the intellectual assests of the entire office forthe benefit and productivity of all, not just my own.andM;* I vow to back up my PC hand disk regularly.andP;  This shows my respects for mywork and the tools I employ.andP;  It'll also help cure my machine if it gets avirus.andM;* I will change my computer passwords everysixmonths or sooner.andP;  I will usehacker-proof passwords, rather than my name, my kids' names, my car's name,my dog's name, or my other's maiden name (which is well known to the creditbureaus).andM;* I will dutifully prepare my &quot;to do&quot; list every morning.andP;  This will allow meto take charge of my work instead of letting my work take charge of me.andM;* I resolve to tell the people I worl with what I appreciate about them.andP;  Thefirst step toward a good day at the office is to create a positiveorganizational environment.andP;  Even the most cynical or lackluster employeewill perk up when his strengths and accomplishments are recognized.andM;I hope this short list inspires self-examination and a commitment to improve.andO;Whether or not one writes a list of new year's resoltuions, please rememberthat each of us is responsbile for making a better life; it is not somethingwe can delegate.andP;  Have a good 1991.andM;Walter R. Houser is reponsible for information resources management andpolicy at a major federal agency.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
