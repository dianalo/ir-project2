The radiation doses originate frominhalation of radioactive particles, ground irradiation from depositednuclides and internal irradiation caused by contaminated food. In Swedenthe largest dose contribution is due to external radiation. Depositionhas been mapped by aerial measurements and in situ high-resolution gammameasurements at ground level over the whole country. On the basis ofthese measurements, population-weighted doses for external radiationhave been estimated. Whole-body measurements on randomly selected individualshave been performed to estimate average dose from internal irradiation.The collective dose, i.e. the sum of all individual doses, has been estimatedto be about 1500 man-Sievert for the first year after Chernobyl and 5000-7000man-Sievert for a 50-year period. Using a risk factor of 0.02 fatal cancersper man-Sievert the Chernobyl fallout over Sweden might cause 100-200fatal cancers.</TEXT></DOC>
