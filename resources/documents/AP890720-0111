The vote was 73-26. A similar bill in the House has not beenvoted out of committee.   The Senate measure would convert the Energy Department's uraniumenrichment operations to a government corporation, a move that someconsumer and environmental groups claim would amount to a $9 billionbailout of the nuclear industry.   ``This is just another attempt by the nuclear industry to raidthe Treasury,'' said Daniel Borson, an nuclear specialist for theenvironmental group Public Citizen. His group had lobbied Senatemembers to defeat the measure.   ``The bill would do nothing to prevent the uranium enrichmentprogram from incurring more debt and eating up more taxpayer moneyin the future,'' Borson added.   The legislation is sponsored by Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., whosestate is host to one of the two Energy Department enrichmentfacilities. The other is in Ohio.   The proposal has strong backing by the Bush administration andthe nuclear industry.   The American Nuclear Energy Council, representing utilities andothers in the nuclear business, called the Senate vote ``a majorstep toward increasing the competitiveness'' of the enrichmententerprise that nuclear utilities are dependent upon.   The government is the only domestic supplier of enriched uranium,which is the fuel used in nuclear reactors. The department's plantsincrease, or ``enrich,'' uranium-235 atoms beyond their naturalconcentration.   ``Electricity consumers will benefit because competitively pricedenrichment services will keep nuclear fuel costs low,'' said EdwardM. Davis, president of the nuclear council.   The proposed new corporation would be independent of the federalbureaucracy and could make financing and operating decisions withoutprior approval from Congress.   The administration says this conversion would make the enrichmentoperation more sound and capable of competing against foreignsuppliers of enrichment services _ including the Soviet Union, whichnow supplies some U.S. nuclear utilities.   The plants also enrich uranium for use in government reactorsthat make materials for nuclear warheads.   Environmentalists and some other citizen groups contend thatsince the utilities benefit from operation of plants built decadesago with taxpayers' money, the industry should be held responsiblefor the debt incurred by the plants.   The Energy Department says the industry should not be heldaccountable because the plants' operation benefit the whole country.It also says there is $3 billion in outstanding debt, not the $9billion claimed by Public Citizen.</TEXT></DOC>
