Under this program, HUD is given discretionary authority toinsure mortgages for land purchase and development in connection with newsubdivisions and new communities. The improvements that may be installedby the developer and financed with the mortgage proceeds include: installationsfor water lines; water supply; sewage disposal; complete water or sewagesystems; and roads, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and storm drains.Title X projects must be designed for primarily residential use, althougha reasonable amount of related non-residential use is permitted. In connectionwith the program, HUD is directed to adopt requirements designed to encouragethe maintenance of a diversified local home-building industry; broad participationby builders, particularly small builders; and the inclusion of a properbalance of housing for families of low and moderate income. On June 29, 1989, Secretary Kemp announced HUD's suspension of the TitleX program. He announced that HUD would discontinue the processing of TitleX applications that had not received a legally binding commitment by June29, 1989, and would return application fees. Projects with legally bindingcommitments issued before June 29, 1989 would be eligible for insurance,subject to a specific examination for evidence of fraud or misrepresentation.The Secretary further stated that HUD would publish a rule proposing toterminate the program. Today's Notice solicits public comment on this proposedtermination. The Secretary proposes to terminate the Title X program on the basis ofthe following factors: the serious adverse financial condition of the program,its inability to meet its statutory goals, the Secretary's judgment thatrestructuring the program would not be an effective way of correcting thesedeficiencies, and the fact that its termination would have virtually noeffect on the availability of financing for land development across theNation. The following discussion addresses each of these points. <ITAG tagnum="84">1. Financial Condition of the Title X Program</ITAG>Land development projects insured under the Title X program are among theriskiest of HUD-insured projects. The development of land is inherentlymore speculative than the development of structures. Moreover, due to thelong development process under the Title X program (typically four to fiveyears), HUD must make accurate projections far into the future about theeconomic conditions and market demand for the improvements that are plannedultimately to be erected on the property. The difficulty of making suchprojections is amply illustrated by the housing depression currently afflictinga number of areas and even entire regions, of the country_a condition thatfew foresaw in either its depth or breadth. Title X has proved to be a financial disaster to the Department and tothe American people. The program has experienced exceptionally high claimrates, and it has already inflicted massive losses on the Department'sinsurance fund, with substantial additional losses anticipated. The programis actuarially unsound, a situation that is particularly troublesome sinceit involves a program that is intended to be self-supporting (see section1008 of the National Housing Act). An analysis of the operations of the program from 1977 to October 1988reveals the following: _Fifty-eight loans were insured under the program (approximately five peryear). These mortgages generated $12.5 million in insurance premiums andfees for the fund and were insured for a total of $505,146,309 (approximately$8.7 million per loan). _Claims have been paid on 25 of the 58 loans. This represents a claim rateof 43 percent. It should be noted, however, that 13 of the 58 loans arestill in the construction phase, during which an insurance claim is farless likely to occur than late in the life of the loan. Based on historicaltrends, defaults are likely to be experienced by at least some of theseprojects. Thus, the 43 percent claim rate understates_and probably significantlyso_the scope of the problem. Claim rates of the order incurred by the TitleX program are astronomically high for any program, but especially for onesuch as Title X that is designed to be operated in an actuarially soundmanner. As a point of comparison, the percent claim rate for the section221(d) multifamily mortgage insurance program for the period 1974 through1988 was 9.87 percent for HUD-processed loans and 17.31 percent for theSection 221(d) coinsurance program. _HUD has experienced no significant reduction in Title X financial problemsdespite changes that were instituted between 1983 and 1985 to improve theprogram. These changes included: restricting the number of lots or unitsin a single phase project to the number of lots that can reasonably besold within two years after final endorsement; limiting the number of acresin land banks to 50 percent of the total project acreage; and requiringa risk analysis test as one of the factors used to determine whether thelots can be sold quickly enough to generate funds required to retire thedebt. From the issuance of the revised Title X handbook in October 1983to October 1988, HUD insured 27 projects. The mortgages of eight of thesepost-1983 projects have been, or are in the process of being, assignedto the Department_a claim rate of 30 percent. Since 13 of these post-1983projects are in the construction phase, this 30 percent claim rate, asnoted above, understates the scope of the financial problem for these loans._By October 1988, 13 of the 25 Title X projects for which HUD has paidclaims since 1977 have been sold, resulting in a total loss to the Federalgovernment of more than $50 million and an average loss of almost $4 millionper claim. Losses on the remaining 12 projects have not, as yet, been determined.However, assuming comparable losses upon the disposition of these projects,HUD anticipates a total loss on the 25 claims of approximately $90 million.The ultimate loss will exceed $90 million, since HUD has issued legallybinding commitments for a number of projects that are still in the pipeline._The Government's future losses under the program can only be expectedto increase if the program is allowed to continue, since the amounts soughtto be insured under individual Title X applications are increasing. InMarch 1989, HUD insured one mortgage for $78 million, and applicationsbeing processed included two applications, each of which involved a mortgagein excess of $75 million.Consequently, HUD believes that approved Title X projects, together withthe propose projects in the pipeline, will continue to subject the FHAinsurance fund to unacceptable financial losses. In moving to discontinuethe Title X program, the Secretary has considered his obligation to ensuresound financial management of the General Insurance Fund and the fact thatthe Title X program was intended to be financially self-sufficient. Thecontinuation of a program that involves such an unacceptably high insuranceclaim rate is inconsistent, in the Secretary's judgment, with his obligationto manage the Fund prudently. This is especially so, since, as noted below,Title X has not achieved its statutory goals.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Inability to Promote Statutory Purposes</ITAG>Section 1005 of the Act states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary shall adopt such requirements as he deems necessaryin land development covered by mortgages insured under Title X to encourage* * * and the inclusion of a proper balance of housing for families ofmoderate or low income.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Various HUD directives acknowledge the statutory goal of encouragingthe inclusion of a proper balance of low- and moderate-income housing (see<T3>e.g., </T3> paragraph 2-4, HUD Handbook 4800.1 Rev-1, dated October1983). However, HUD has been unable, through its handbooks and regulations,to achieve this desired program goal.The HUD Inspector General draft audit report dated March 31, 1987 reviewed17 Title X projects in three HUD regions that produced 11,300 housing units.These projects collectively were insured for a total of $212 million. Thereview revealed that only a single project may have provided housing formoderate-income persons, and no project provided housing for families withlow incomes.HUD believes that the inability to attain this goal is inherent in theTitle X program and in the very nature of the financing of land development.Housing located on land developed under the program is typically new constructionthat is designed for sale to prospective homeowners. This type of housinggenerally costs more than low-income families, and even many moderate-incomefamilies, can afford to pay. In addition, undeveloped land suitable foruse in the program is generally located in suburban areas, and involvesan ``up-scale'' emphasis that is often beyond the reach of even moderate-incomefamilies. Finally, given the high risk level and economic uncertaintiesthat attend loans for land development, developers naturally desire theeconomic ``cushion'' afforded by higher-priced homes. Thus, the centralthrust of Title X is away from the very income groups the statute directsthe Department to focus upon in administering the program.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Can Title X Be Fixed?</ITAG>The Department has carefully considered whether Title X's central ills_anastronomical claim rate and an inability to meet the program's statutorypurposes_can be cured by restructuring the program and committing moreHUD resources and staff to its administration. Even assuming that suchan investment of resources would be possible in this period of Budget restraint,the Department does not believe that the effort would pay off.The private sector currently finances virtually all land development projectswithout the need for Federal insurance. Although data are limited, theDepartment estimates that between 4,000 and 6,000 subdivisions are developedannually in the United States. By comparison, activity under the TitleX program since 1977 has averaged only five applications per year. Lookedat another way, Title X's share of the land development market has averagedonly about <T3>.001</T3>_one-tenth of one percent_of the national total_an infinitesimalcontribution to the total financing for land development.If the Department undertook to ``fix'' Title X, we believe that the resultwould reduce the current five applications per year to zero. Any restructuringof the program would include more rigorous requirements to ensure the participationof small builders and a significant proportion of low- and moderate-incomefamilies in the housing ultimately developed. It also would involve stricterunderwriting standards and other measures to ensure that insured projectsrepresented a substantially improved mortgage insurance risk. The Departmentbelieves that ``tightening'' the program in these ways_ways literally requiredby Title X_would virtually end any developer interest in the program. Thus,continuation of the program confronts the Department with an impossibledilemma: permit the program to continue as is and tolerate continued financialhemorrhaging, or take steps to revamp the program and, in so doing, effectivelykill it. The Department believes that neither of these alternatives isacceptable: the proper response is simply to terminate the program.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Effect on the Availability of Financing for Land Development</ITAG>Finally, it should be noted that the termination of Title X would havevirtually no effect on the availability of financing for land developmentacross the Nation. As indicated above, the private sector finances theoverwhelming number of land developments, with Title X's share of the marketbeing negligible.For these reasons, HUD is proposing to revise Part 205_Mortgage insurancefor land development (Title X), to add a new andSection; 205.2. This newsection would state that projects with legally binding commitments issuedbefore June 29, 1989, and projects with notes that were initially endorsedbefore June 29, 1989, would be governed by the eligibility and other requirementsof part 205 (subpart A) as it currently exists. No other projects wouldbe eligible for insurance under Title X. Subpart B and andSection; 205.1(definitions) would be retained to govern the rights and obligations underexisting Title X mortgage insurance contracts. The remainder of part 205would be removed. Miscellaneous cross-references to part 205 Title II wouldbe removed, except for cross-references contained in the delegation provisionsin part 200, subpart D, which will be addressed in a separate final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Certifications</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerkat the above address.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(d) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. An analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theundersigned hereby certifies that this rule would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The eliminationof the program would not have a significant economic impact, since conventionalinsurance for land development projects is available and is used by developersmuch more frequently than is Title X. As noted above, approximately .1percent of subdivisions in the United States are developed under TitleX. Moreover because few Title X-insured mortgages are provided to smallentities, HUD does not believe that a substantial number of small entitieswould be affected.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,The Family, has determined that the rule will not have a significant impacton family formation, maintenance, or well-being. While the proposed rulewould eliminate a mortgage insurance program that furthers the developmentof subdivisions available for housing for families, relatively few lotsare developed annually under the program, and alternative conventionalfinancing is available. HUD, thus, does not believe that the rule wouldhave significant ``family impact.''The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of ExecutiveOrder 12612, federalism, has determined that the final rule does not involvethe preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation and does nothave ``federalism implications.'' The rule would eliminate a little-usedmortgage insurance program to assist private developers. It should haveno appreciable impact on State or local governments.This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulationspublished on April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708) under Executive Order 12291,Federal Regulation, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.125.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>24 CFR Part 200Administrative practice and procedure; Claims; Equal Housing Opportunity;Fair Housing; Housing standards; Loan programs: housing and community development;Mortgage insurance; Organization and functions (Government agencies); Reportingand recordkeeping requirements; Minimum Property Standards; Incorporationby reference.24 CFR Part 205Community facilities; Mortgage insurance; Land development.Accordingly, the Department would amend 24 CFR parts 200 and 205 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 200_INTRODUCTION</ITAG>1.
