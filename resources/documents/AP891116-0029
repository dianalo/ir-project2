Malcolm Wallop,R-Wyo., asked Wednesday, shortly before the Senate overwhelminglyagreed to the fiscal 1990 military bill.   The legislation, approved 91-8, cuts $1.1 billion from thepresident's proposal of $4.9 billion for SDI, about $279 millionless than the fiscal 1989 amount and the first budget reduction inthe program in six years.   Bush is expected to sign the bill, which trimmed his request forother major strategic programs such as the MX and Midgetman nuclearmissiles and the B-2 stealth bomber.   The House, meanwhile, approved by voice vote a companionmilitary spending bill that provides the money to implement thepolicies in the defense legislation.   The $286 billion spending bill, which goes to the Senate for itsconsideration, largely mirrors the defense legislation on funds forSDI, land-based nuclear missiles and the B-2 bomber.   The House eliminated a handful of contentious issues, includingan amendment providing House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., withan Air Force C-20 aircraft at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland,ready at his request.   The substitute amendment allows Foley the use of an Air Forceaircraft when he needs it, consistent with current practice.   Among the other prickly issues dropped from the bill was anamendment providing a classified amount of money for the SR-71 spyplane, a program the administration decided to cancel.   However, lawmakers may have created more problems when theyeliminated about $90 million earmarked for university projects inthe home districts of House and Senate members.   The spending bill cuts $400 million from the administration'srequest for $1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident 2 missileand $11 million from the administration's $216 million request fortesting the troubled missile.   That bill also prohibits spending more than $250 million on theprogram until three successful flight tests have occurred. InAugust, the weapon suffered its second successive failure inundersea test firings, exploding seconds after being launched.   In the Senate, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia, said the defense bill ``continuesstrategic modernization at a somewhat slower rate than theadministration sought.''   But Wallop bemoaned the fate of SDI particularly in light of theRepublican administration's inaction.   ``I must fault the administration for failing to fight harderfor SDI funding and not sticking to their own pronouncements on theimportance of the program,'' said Wallop, who voted against thebill.   Overall, the bills provide $4.3 billion for the B-2, $430million less than the administration requested for the fiscal yearthat began Oct. 1.   Money is included for two bombers in fiscal 1990, one less thanthe administration sought, but adopts Bush's proposal forcomponents for five bombers in fiscal 1991.   Approximately $1.1 billion is included for two land-basednuclear missiles: the multiple-warhead, rail-based MX and thesingle-warhead, truck-based Midgetman. The bills trim about $150million from the administration's request for the two weapons andincludes House language imposing a 50-missile cap on the MX.   The legislation provides for the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighterand the AHIP helicopter _ for one more year _ and postpones adecision on the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey and the Phoenix missile.   The bills accept the administration's plan to kill six otherprograms, including the SSN-688 submarine, the F-15 aircraft andthe M-88 tank recovery vehicle.</TEXT></DOC>
