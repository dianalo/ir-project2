The City Council of Yonkers, just north of New York, voted Monday to reject a resolution supporting a plan for 1,000 units of affordable housing. Lawyers and civil-rights experts across the country said that while hundreds of communities have threatened similar actions during the past 30 years, few have ever carried out their threats.    &quot;In practice, this has almost never happened,&quot; said Gary Orfield, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and an expert on desegregation. &quot;You have local officials saying they don't have to obey the Constitution.&quot;    U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who had ordered the council to pass the resolution, yesterday called Yonkers &quot;a national symbol of defiance to civil rights.&quot; Finding the city in contempt, he imposed a fine that began at $100 a day and doubles daily, until the city complies with the court's order. In just 3 1/2 weeks, such a fine would exceed Yonkers's annual operating budget of $337 million.    Judge Sand also imposed a daily fine of $500 on each council member who voted against the resolution. He added that the council members would be sent to jail next Wednesday if they didn't reverse their decision.    Observers said the city's action probably won't spark similar decisions in other communities; the risks and costs are simply too high. Rather, they said, Yonkers is a city that feels threatened by change, one that thought it could eventually wear down its opponents.    &quot;After 30 years, it's like Little Rock, Ark., and Selma, Ala., again,&quot; said Winston A. Ross, the regional director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Westchester County, where Yonkers is located.    But even officials in Little Rock and Selma, civil-rights specialists point out, didn't go so far as to defy a federal court's orders.    The case in Yonkers began in 1974, when minority residents began to fight what they saw as a pattern of discrimination in the city. In 1980, the U.S. Justice Department charged that Yonkers had intentionally segregated its schools and housing for 40 years.    In 1985, Judge Sand found the city liable for its actions. A year later, after the school system already had developed an integration plan, Judge Sand ordered city officials to build 1,000 housing units for families with low and moderate incomes.    The city appealed Judge Sand's decisions. In June, however, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the lower court.    City officials have contended that Yonkers has sufficient housing for families with low and moderate incomes. They also argue that the wealthy towns that border Yonkers should be doing much more to provide such housing. Said Prof. Orfield at the University of Chicago, &quot;I can understand why constituents would be upset.&quot;    But backers of Judge Sand's decision said they have little sympathy for Yonkers's arguments and the penalties that the city now faces.    &quot;For 10 years or more we have fought to tear down the walls of segregation in Yonkers,&quot; said Hazel N. Dukes, president of the New York State Conference of the NAACP. &quot;If they're willing to go to jail, that's fine with us. If they want their city to go bankrupt, it won't hurt us anymore than we've already been hurt.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
