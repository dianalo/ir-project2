These components includediode detectors, Si MOSFETS and GaAs MESFETS. The radiation environmentsconsidered include total dose gamma, high dose rate gamma, high energyheavy particles and neutrons. The total dose effect of charge trappingand interface state generation in the Silicon dioxide due to total dosegamma is discussed. The large photocurrents due either to high dose rategamma or high energy heavy particles are discussed. Some of the processoptimizations used to enhance the radiation immunity in Si technologyand their relevance to a better and more reliable fiber optic systemare presented.</TEXT></DOC>
