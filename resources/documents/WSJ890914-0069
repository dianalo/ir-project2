At a post-meeting news conference, Mr. Lorenzo said there have been &quot;no discussions with domestic air carriers, and that hasn't changed.&quot; That statement seems to eliminate as bidders Donald Trump and Carl Icahn, who both own airlines and have been the subject of speculation on a Continental sale.    At the meeting, Mr. Lorenzo indicated that he doesn't regard such a transaction as urgent. &quot;While a sale remains possible, and discussions are continuing, I must reiterate that the reasons not to sell remain every bit as important as when we first announced these discussions,&quot; he said.    Mr. Lorenzo raised the possibility of a sale last month. At that time, he said reasons not to sell included the airline's potential for improved results, after two years of record losses, and his long, personal involvement with Continental.    Meanwhile, Texas Air agreed to lend its Eastern Airlines unit $45 million to help pay part of a $98 million pension fund payment due tomorrow, the first time the parent has been drawn into Eastern's bankruptcy-law proceedings. Texas Air agreed to the loan after negotiating for weeks with Eastern creditors and the Internal Revenue Service. Only $72 million will be paid tomorrow -- Texas Air's $45 million loan and $27 million from Eastern asset sales. The IRS has granted a temporary waiver for the remainder. </TEXT></DOC>
