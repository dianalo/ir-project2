 Way high.andP;  And the wonder of it ishow close it gets to the sun.andM;This network application aspires to be nothing less than a total workingenvironment for business groups.andP;  The Notes frontier is a &quot;place&quot; beyond theusual limits of time and space, where workgroups can create, store,distribute, and share information in ways no one has tried before.andM;Remarkably, the program actually achieves some of its lofty goals.andP;  Althoughit has flaws, Notes represents the shape of things to come in PC computing.andO;It's the first program to infuse the concept of groupware with pulsing,practical vitality.andM;Notes stands apart from other early forays into the unexplored territory ofgroup-oriented software because it displays a unique understanding of theinformation-centered work users long to do on office PCs.andP;  In the past,people had no choice but to approach their business work in groups--staffmeetings, committees, teams, departments--and their PC tasks as individuals.andO;And local area networks failed to change this reality: LANs linked themachines, but the users remained locked into largely stand-aloneapplications.andM;Lotus Notes creates an application structure that accommodates a groupwithout wresting control from individual users.andP;  Any Notes user can create anapplication database and become its manager--with complete control over whatit does, how it works, who can use it, and even whether it lives or dies.andO;Notes is democracy in action, an effective balance between the divergentaspirations of individuals and the confederating power of MIS.andM;Because of its success at maintaining this delicate balance, Notes stands astrong chance of becoming the first group-oriented package to be a majorforce in the PC marketplace.andP;  Lotus hopes to make this happen by selling theproduct through direct sales calls to Fortune 500 company MIS departments.andO;But chances are excellent that despite its group flavor, Notes will bechampioned in corporations by individuals, gaining acceptance via theunderground railroad of user word of mouth.andM;Manufacturers Hanover Trust is one of the most active beta sites for Notes.andO;Pat Sziklai, vice president for information services there, has alreadywitnessed the first signs of grassroots user mania.andP;  &quot;Notes is addictive,&quot;she says.andP;  &quot;People who aren't technical use it and feel empowered.andP;  They moveto another group and pretty soon that group wants to be hooked up to Notes.&quot;andO;And so Notes, by being both formal and free-form, may ring in a new era of PCpopulism in corporate computing.andM;What exactly is Notes?andP;  Even Lotus has had problems describing its newproduct.andP;  Before the official product announcement, late last year, Notes wasa &quot;document management system.&quot;andP;  At the unveiling, it was dubbed &quot;groupcommunication software.&quot;andP;  In fact, Notes is both these things--and more.andM;Is Notes Groupware?andM;Lotus has also called Notes &quot;groupware&quot;--but cautiously.andP;  The term groupwareis so fuzzy that it doesn't do much to describe Notes, and it may evenobfuscate the matter further by focusing attention on what Notes doesn't do,rather than what it does do.andM;The few applications that have begun to define groupware have been based oncoordinating the activities of a group.andP;  Packages like The Coordinator,WordPerfect Office, and Syzygy are built around electronic mail, sharedcalendars, group scheduling, or project management functions.andP;  Because Notesdoesn't come with appointment-calendar functions or a scheduling application,at first glance it doesn't look like what we've come to think of asgroupware.andM;The lack of a calendar in Notes might be a mistake, says Susanna Opper, aconsultant based in New York City who works on groupware issues for corporateclients.andP;  &quot;As I watch people use these products, they want to do that kind ofcoordination, the logistical stuff of scheduling meetings and distributingagendas.&quot;andP;  But scheduling is only one category of groupware.andP;  There are manymore of them, says Opper.andP;  &quot;It isn't like spreadsheets, where there aredifferent brands but they all do pretty much the same thing.andP;  Notes is adifferent category of groupware.&quot;andM;Notes begins to look more familiar when compared with other categories ofgroupware products.andP;  Its e-mail features are strong.andP;  Its data managementcapabilities make it look something like a contact management package.andP;  Withits strengths in tracking and indexing messages and responses, it resembles acomputer conferencing application.andP;  In fact, Notes is something of achameleon: where other groupware products tend to shape the organizationsthat adopt them, Notes is shaped by its users.andM;The trade-off lies between the short-term work needed to develop Notesapplications and the long-term usability of groupware applications thataren't customizable.andM;Three Functions, Two PartsandM;Notes is built on three major functions: information management, documentformatting, and wide area communication.andP;  It aims to make all aspects of allthree functions available to every member of a group, in a high-confidence,high-security environment and across any standard PC local area network.andM;Architecturally, Notes comes in two parts.andP;  The server piece runs on anetworked PC that manages a group's data and communications.andP;  The clientpiece runs on all other PCs in the group.andP;  It handles requests from groupmembers to the server for data and other services.andP;  This setup represents oneof the first real-world implementations of client-server architecture, awidely ballyhooed but little understood computer industry catchphrase.andP;  Forthis achievement alone, Lotus Notes deserves honor.andM;Notes runs on any NetBIOS-compatible LAN, including Novell NetWare, 3Com, andIBM's PC LAN.andP;  Notes' server software can support either DOS or OS/2 clients.andO;The Notes client software runs on PCs with either DOS and Windows or OS/2 andPresentation Manager.andP;  Both the server and client programs are sizable (theWindows version of the client application, for instance, takes up 490K).andM;Notes at WorkandM;To the user, Notes begins as an icon on the PC's Notes screen.andP;  This verysimple initial view of the program borrows most of its appearance from theWindows/Presentation Manager graphical interface.andP;  Drop-down menus list theprogram's commands, and individual application databases appear as icons withtheir names beside them.andM;A mouse click on an icon opens a &quot;view&quot; into the documents it represents, andthis view looks much like a traditional database report.andP;  Information fromfields in the documents is arranged in columns, and each row represents adocument in the application database.andP;  The presentation definitions for thecolumns and the rules for document selection are written in a macro languagethat uses the familiar 1-2-3 @ functions, yet few of these scripts will lookfamiliar to 1-2-3 users.andM;Creating views for a Notes application takes a significant chunk of theuser's or manager's development effort.andP;  Shortcuts are few in Notesapplication development--no ad hoc query, no &quot;watch-me&quot; keystroke recorder tobuild definitions and formulas, no menu-driven application generator.andP;  Allformulas involving @ functions have to be written out like program code.andO;This may appear to be a bother, but it makes sense.andP;  Building a Notesapplication is a programming task that requires keeping more than one personin mind, so individual code-writing has to be careful and complete before itcan become part of the system.andM;An example of the macro-building price exacted in a group-orientedenvironment comes from comparing similar tasks in Notes and its Lotus cousin,the personal information manager Agenda.andP;  Both Notes and Agenda use&quot;categories,&quot; &quot;views,&quot; &quot;templates,&quot; and the like, but Agenda lets yourandomly pound in data, then organize it as you wish later.andP;  Notes requiresmore formal structure up front.andP;  Data has to have a place to go--a field (ina form) or a category (in a view)--before it can be entered into Notes.andP;  ANotes application database needs careful planning to determine which fields,which forms, which views, and which access controls to use.andM;Despite the detail required, users will write Notes applications--probablylots of them, and probably some of the best user-derived programs ever.andO;Notes rewards clear understanding of a business problem by allowing astraightforward script to deliver a clear, easy-to-use application.andP;  And thesoftware makes it easy for users to get started.andP;  Templates for basicapplications such as computer conferencing, client contact-tracking, andproblem reporting are included with the program.andP;  At the same time, the Notesdevelopment environment is powerful enough that extremely complexapplications are possible.andM;Building Notes applications is worth the effort because it produces programsthat are tailored to the needs of their user/developers and are thereforeeasier for their true customers to understand.andP;  For users, success with Notesdoesn't depend on mastering an outside report-writing package or learning anindependent command language.andP;  All the elements for success dwell within theNotes environment.andM;Confidentiality and security are two of Notes' most strikingly originalcharacteristics.andP;  Most current applications leave security to the underlyingoperating system; Notes guarantees the sanctity of its own documents.andP;  (See&quot;How Does Notes Handle Security?&quot; on page 117.)andM;Lotus's Own TestandM;Perhaps the best way to explain Notes is to show how it actually works for acorporate group.andP;  One of the most ambitious Notes applications at this earlystage is a sales activity reporting system used at Lotus.andP;  (Like a doctor whohas developed a new medicine, Lotus conducted extensive in-house Notesexperiments before prescribing the product for the public.)andP;  After gatheringfield information from sales and marketing staff, the system consolidates itinto reports for upper management at Lotus headquarters.andM;Private views and access controls play a major part in the Lotus salessystem.andP;  Views in Notes can be restricted for use only by individuals ormembers of group lists.andP;  Only sales department managers can view personnelinformation in Lotus's sales-activity database, for instance.andP;  Evaluationsand other sensitive documents are hidden from users in other departments.andM;The basic building blocks of Lotus's sales activity are the salespersons'monthly reports, which detail contacts and customer feedback and pass alongideas and marketplace information.andP;  Each report is a separate document in theNotes database, and each individual document is based on a group-consistentform.andM;Forms are created by laying out named fields onscreen and assigningattributes to them.andP;  A field may represent numbers, text, or Rich Text--textformatted much the way a word processor formats a document (in fact, Notes'Rich Text Format is borrowed from Microsoft Word).andP;  Field types arespecialized as well: an &quot;Author&quot; field is automatically filled with the nameof a document's creator; a &quot;Date&quot; field can correctly interpret entries like&quot;today&quot; and &quot;3/6&quot;; a keyword field can be turned into a selection list ofcheck boxes or radio buttons.andM;A form can also be graphic.andP;  Graphics files, such as company logos, can bepositioned on forms.andP;  And Notes supports varied text fonts, sizes, andcolors.andP;  Even an application's icon can be edited, and the icons on thetemplates distributed with Notes give a hint of the hours that pixel Picassoswill spend developing miniature masterpieces in shops that adopt the product.andM;Some of these features will look more than fleetingly familiar to users ofHyperCard for the Macintosh.andP;  The workspace with its icons looks somethinglike the Home Card, and the individual forms, with their heavy formattingcapabilities, check boxes, and radio boxes, are far more Mac-like thanPC-like.andM;Lotus's sales activity application replaced a paper-based system thatproduced a 200-page report once a quarter.andP;  That process had some majorproblems that Notes has resolved, according to Ron Turcotte, who created theapplication and now administers it.andP;  For example, the quarterly productionschedule was too long.andP;  After three months, every problem had grown into acrisis.andP;  Three months' worth of bulky reports also proved difficult todigest.andP;  The daunting paper reports would lie in an in-basket unread untilthey were thrown out to make room for new reports.andP;  And the paper reportspresented only two cuts of the information: sales contacts and marketintelligence.andP;  It wasn't easy to look at the contents in any otherconfiguration--by competitor, for example.andM;The great value of the Notes application has been in the amount of timesaved, says Jim Manzi, CEO of Lotus.andP;  The salespeople and management can nowdo in hours what once took days, and three weeks have been cut off thereport's production cycle.andP;  &quot;The work is more valuable because it's morecurrent and more accessible,&quot; says Manzi.andP;  &quot;It's a win on time and qualityfor sure, and on capacity to respond.&quot;andM;Akey to building a successful system in Notes, creator Turcotte says, istraining.andP;  The training time for a user to become functional in Notes isabout half an hour, but it's necessary training.andP;  Training programs andcontinuing user support earned Lotus's system a better reception than earlier(failed) sales reporting efforts received, according to Turcotte.andM;It's not surprising that Lotus should be able to mine value from its ownproduct.andP;  The more important question is whether potential Notes users inother organizations can catch the wave.andM;Lotus is fielding a brand-new direct sales force to provide the missionaryselling and ongoing support that Notes needs.andP;  It's an impressive commitmenton Lotus's part.andP;  Unfortunately it requires an impressive commitment on thecustomer's part: although Notes' price per user is reasonable, to meet thehigh cost of the direct-sales approach Lotus has set the minimum purchase at$62,500 for a 200-user site license, including training, documentation, andtech support.andP;  (See the Perspective column on page 11.)andM;Brilliant CompromisesandM;Notes' potential can probably best be judged by considering the alternatives:How much of what Notes does can be duplicated by other programs?andP;  On afunction-by-function basis, little about Notes is dazzlingly original.andP;  Itselectronic mail, for example, isn't much different from that of standalonee-mail packages, whereas its ability to provide access to external mailsystems is woefully weak compared with most of those offerings.andP;  Similarcomparisons could be made on a function-by-function basis of Notes versusdatabase managers, word processors, presentation graphics packages, executiveinformation systems, newswire services, and a variety of more specializedpackages that do things like client tracking and document management.andM;The genius of Notes lies in the number of such comparisons it evokes.andP;  Allproducts it can be compared with do what they do as well as or better thanNotes does.andP;  But none of them handles as much in so many functional areas.andO;The integration of previously disparate tasks in Notes means that no e-mailpackage can match its message-formatting capabilities, and no word processorcan rival its document-management skills.andP;  What other database manager canturn a data-entry form into an e-mail message just by adding a field named&quot;SendTo&quot;?andP;  Notes is a brilliantly programmed collection of compromises, andthat makes the whole much greater than the sum of its parts.andM;Just how good is this unified working environment for you?andP;  That depends onhow wedded you are to your current working environments, one of which is thepatchwork of applications and utilities you run on your PC; the other is thereal world where you deal with real people.andM;Notes probably won't compete well in the first situation.andP;  If your companyalready has an electronic mail system that reaches people Notes doesn't,you'll leave Notes to use it.andP;  If you make extensive use of the multiplecolumns or tables features in a word processor, you'll abandon Notes forthat.andP;  If you spend most of your day in Lotus 1-2-3, you'll visit Notes onlyoccasionally.andP;  (Despite its nascent abilities to import and export data,Notes is still pretty much a functional island.andP;  Things can be automatedwithin Notes, but it has no tool for automating big data-transfer jobs withthe outside world--using terminal emulation to pull data from a mainframe,for instance.)andM;But if e-mail is your life and everybody you interact with is on Notes,you'll pick up the Notes text editor quickly (there's not that much to pickup) and visit your word processor less often as time goes by.andP;  If you writeshort notes and fill out forms all day--memos, call reports, requests forpurchase orders--you're a likely candidate for an advanced degree in Notesform design.andP;  Notes can soak up a high percentage of your in-house phonecalls and those discussions that begin, &quot;Just a quick question....&quot;andP;  AndNotes can manage the distribution of a dozen copies of a report without tripsto the copy machine and the mailroom.andP;  And six months later, Notes willremember that a copy went to Sam in Production, no matter what he says.andM;Three Conditions for SuccessandM;Because Notes works at the intersection of the PC environment and the realworld, its chances for success will be greater if three basic businessconditions are met.andP;  First, all the workers and departments affected by whathappens in the Notes environment need access to Notes.andP;  Second, the Notesapplications must be built to a critical mass, so that most of the data thatmost people want is easier to find within Notes than outside it.andP;  Third,everybody expected to use Notes should have a PC capable of running it.andM;This may sound obvious, but it's not.andP;  The Notes client software will rununder Windows on a 640K 286 machine, but the performance is awful.andP;  A fast286 with a couple of megabytes of RAM is the minimum acceptable hardwareplatform for a Notes workstation.andP;  Performance is much improved by OS/2 and4MB of RAM.andP;  But equipping everybody to run OS/2 and a graphical interfaceups the ante considerably for organizations that might benefit from Notes.andO;They may have to invest in anything from the major sticker shock of morepowerful PCs to the easily overlooked cost of adding mice to all theirmachines.andM;Still, the costs of upgrading users' hardware to run advanced operatingsystems will be quickly repaid.andP;  Both Windows and OS/2 are becoming morecapable: Windows 3.0, due for introduction this spring, fixes much of theworst of Windows.andP;  OS/2 2.0 (the 386-specific version of OS/2) is due laterthis year.andP;  And Notes itself is a moving target: Lotus has a list ofimprovements in the works that will make it more capable.andM;At its introduction, Lotus officials were talking about fixes to minorannoyances, like the 64K limit on the size of graphics files that can beimported into documents, and major upgrades, like an application programminginterface (API) that will enable programmers to write extensions in the Clanguage to handle such chores as automatic data conversions for proprietaryfile formats and access to external e-mail systems such as IBM Profs.andP;  Alsohigh on Lotus's list is support for the MHS (Message Handling Services)protocol to provide access to the many e-mail systems, such as Da VincieMail, Higgins, and cc:Mail, that support this message format.andP;  In the longerterm, Lotus plans a complete gateway toolkit for constructing customizedcommunications gateways to other systems.andM;Installation and ManagementandM;While application-building punch and a sense of freedom will matter most toindividual Notes users, network installation and management issues will playa major role in determining whether Notes captures the hearts and minds ofsystems professionals.andP;  Overall, Notes appears to have no more drawbacks thanother network software, and it boasts a few alluring advantages.andM;Getting a Notes installation up and running is straightforward.andP;  (See &quot;HowHard Is Notes to Install?&quot; on page 105.)andP;  Creating user and server IDs takessome work because Notes' security features rest on the system's ability tovalidate the user.andP;  Each ID includes public and private encryption keys, forinstance, which can generate an electronic signature that a remote server canuse to verify that a message that says it came from John Smith really didcome from John Smith.andM;The system manager's control over replication of applications across Notesservers, or servers and remote users, is one of the most interesting andinnovative aspects of the package.andM;A Notes application and all its associated data can reside on any number ofNotes servers, and Notes manages the process of keeping those multiple copiesin sync.andP;  A document added on one server will be added on any other serverthe next time those two servers connect and trade information on the state ofapplications they know they share.andP;  If the two servers are on the samenetwork, they can connect that way.andP;  More typically, replication is done viatelephone lines.andM;The administrator sets the replication list and schedule for eachapplication, and the servers become a sort of virtual wide area network thatcan adopt any of several distribution schemes.andP;  One server can be a hub andreplicate with every other server on the list, or changes can propagatethrough a chain of servers.andP;  Servers can replicate applications as frequentlyor infrequently as is tolerable.andP;  Heavy e-mail traffic between two locationsmay mean a replication every 15 minutes, while the corporate policy manualmay need replicating only once a month.andM;Notes allows for admirable configuration flexibility.andP;  One Notes beta tester,Corporate Software, has three Notes sites: one in Massachusetts, one inEngland, and one in Germany.andP;  The U.S.andP;  server replicates with its Britishcounterpart, which in turn updates with Germany.andP;  One system administratorsays that this two-hop configuration was the best solution to the problems ofconnecting foreign phone systems.andM;So flexible is the Notes system that individual PC users who aren't onnetworks can still replicate applications with Notes servers or connect viamodem to a remote Notes server and use applications resident on that server.andM;The Overwriting ProblemandM;The way Notes runs on a network leaves room for some interesting interactionsamong users--and for some potential fistfights, if two users makesimultaneous changes to the same document and one wipes out the work of theother.andM;Notes can't prevent users from simultaneously editing the same document,because the same data may exist in replicated files on servers and on users'PCs.andM;Two users may open the same document and edit it without either being awareof the other's actions.andP;  Even when User A saves her edited version, she isleft blissfully unaware of User B's existence.andM;If both users are clients of the same server, User B will be warned when hetries to save his changes: &quot;Another copy of this document was saved while youwere editing it.andP;  Overwrite it?&quot;andM;If User A and User B are clients of separate servers, User B won't even get awarning.andP;  User B's version will be replicated to other servers even whileUser A thinks the boss is seeing her work.andP;  This &quot;last edit wins&quot; rule isn'thard and fast, because Notes also checks to see which version of the documenthas been edited most often since the last replication and passes on that oneinstead of the most recent version.andP;  (The &quot;last edit wins&quot; rule may fail foranother reason: Notes applies it based on the computers' system clocks.andP;  Ifthe last edit was saved on a machine whose clock was an hour or a week slowerthan the other, it won't be treated as the last edit.)andM;Whether permitting concurrent access to data is a major problem for Notesdepends on the application--and on corporate culture, because the bestsolutions are as much cultural as technical.andP;  The alternative, some kind ofrecord-locking or more elaborate user notification, would imposeperformance-degrading overhead on the system, and even if it could be made towork, it would work for only one server.andM;Many Roles for NotesandM;Notes' ability to exchange strictly limited amounts of information in asecure environment has vast implications for how the product may be used.andO;For example, it holds the potential for sharing application databases notjust within a company but between companies.andP;  A single workgroup might evencomprise people from several companies.andP;  Consultants can share dedicatedapplications with their clients.andM;Notes may also have a role as a smart publishing medium.andP;  Reuters is alreadydelivering its newswire services via Notes, which can add value at eachclient location with filters and views that customize the information foreach customer.andM;Will Notes succeed?andP;  We don't know.andP;  We do know that it's the firstgroup-oriented application that has a chance to make good--it's the first tooffer in software a useful reflection of practical business reality.andP;  Andeven if the product doesn't catch on, or if it has a painfully elongatedtakeoff curve, a la OS/2, it still represents the initial iteration of a formand style that will become common in the PC software of tomorrow.andM;By aiming high, Notes lifts everyone's sights to a more distant horizon.andM;Notes' Takers: Sheldon LaubeandM;Company: Price WaterhouseandM;Headquarters: New York, New YorkandM;Setup: Approximately 25 percent of the company's 10,000 PCs are currentlylinked on Novell networks; 100 percent will be networked within the next twoyears.andM;Only six months of beta use, limited staff training, and some hastyinstallations were enough to persuade Price Waterhouse to buy 10,000 copiesof Notes when it was released in December.andM;&quot;We think Notes has the potential to make a major transformation in how we'llbe able to serve our clients,&quot; says Sheldon Laube, national director ofinformation and technology.andP;  The business advisory firm, which employshundreds of advisory teams to serve customers around the world, will useNotes to store and retrieve its &quot;expertise base&quot; of correspondence,documents, and reference material and to track and manage the activities ofits global clients.andP;  Notes, says Laube, improves company communication notonly by making it more open but also by making it more valuable, as users areable to &quot;enter expertise from anywhere and see it from everywhere.&quot;andM;Only a small core of Price Waterhouse employees have used Notes to date, butLaube isn't daunted by that situation or the fact that many eventual Notesusers aren't PC literate.andP;  Employees like what they've seen so far, and,Laube adds, many PC neophytes think Notes is how software should work.andM;Notes' Takers: Christine Thompson, Mary Beth FenderandM;Company: Manufacturers Hanover TrustandM;Headquarters: New York, New YorkandM;Setup: The company maintains several Novell NetWare networks (not allcurrently run Notes) and 2,000 386s with 4MB of RAM.andP;  The typical networksetup has 45 to 60 end-user machines, 4 or 6 print servers with 10 to 15people per server, at least one communications server, and one basic fileserver.andP;  One server is needed for Notes.andP;  Servers have 300MB to 600MB harddisks.andM;Notes debuted at Manufacturers Hanover Trust over a year ago, ending thebank's search for software that would allow its account officers to shareknowledge about customers and prospects.andM;The resulting account management system has two databases.andP;  One containscustomer profiles.andP;  The second handles day-to-day customer contacts.andM;Mary Beth Fender, an assistant vice president with the firm, assistedapplications developer Christine Thompson in designing the Notes applicationsused by the four- or five-person groups handling accounts.andP;  Initially,account officers need to key in the essential data that makes up thedatabases.andM;Despite the start-up drudgery, entering the data pays dividends, says Fender,citing the ability to instantaneously update and sort items.andP;  Thompson addsthat Manufacturers Hanover will experience the true benefits of Notes whenpeople throughout the bank use it and people who now interact infrequentlybegin to communicate regularly.andM;Can You Use Notes WhenandM;Your're Away from the Office?andM;All right, so Notes is great if you're on a network.andP;  But what if you're offthe network--way off, say, in a hotel room three time zones away?andM;Notes is still great.andP;  If you travel with a laptop and depend on electronicmail, or if you occasionally work on a PC at home, you can do anything withNotes as a dial-up remote user that you can do on the network.andP;  You justcan't do it nearly as quickly--unless you've got a 9,600-bps modem in yourlaptop and on your Notes server back at the office.andM;Notes installs on a dial-up PC just the way it does on a network workstation:you simply need two high-density disks and a copy of your all-important IDfile.andP;  Enter into your personal name-and-address book the name and telephonenumber of the server you want to connect to and choose &quot;Dial&quot; from theOptions menu.andP;  Notes does the rest.andM;You can run the Notes client program on a remote PC in a few different ways.andO;The simplest method is to access the server across phone lines as if you wereusing a local area network.andP;  This method has a couple of major drawbacks,though.andP;  One is that staying online for hours can run up long-distance bills.andO;The other is that at 1,200 or 2,400 bps Notes gives new meaning to slow.andP;  Itcan take two minutes to open a brief document, four minutes to upload ane-mail message to the server.andM;One way to minimize the waiting period is to time-shift.andP;  You can replicateapplications with the server just as if you were another server.andP;  So if theapplication you're working in contains relatively few documents, replicate acopy of it on your local PC, do your work offline, and then dial up theserver and replicate the application again when you're finished.andP;  Thisprocedure isn't actually any faster, but at least you can do something elsewhile Notes is processing the changes more or less in batch mode.andM;The process of replicating an application database at 1,200 bps is painfullyslow, even by standards familiar to users of CompuServe and similar services.andO;Increasing the size of one database file from 32,768 to 98,304 bytes took 16minutes, for example.andM;Unfortunately, one crucial application doesn't benefit even from this batchmode: e-mail.andP;  Because sending mail involves more than just adding documentsto a database, you have to send e-mail messages individually.andM;If you've got the horses to run OS/2, though, you can dramatically ease thepain of waiting at the end of the wire.andP;  Install two copies of Notes on yourmachine, one configured to be the server program, one the workstation.andP;  Runthe server in background, and it will handle all the annoying details ofdialing out to send mail and manage replications.andM;Notes has no built-in dial-back capability.andP;  The server can't take a callfrom a remote user, hang up, and call back a predetermined number.andO;Presumably, the reason is that most packages that do dial-back do it forsecurity reasons, and Notes isn't as directly vulnerable to hackers as some.andO;But because dial-back is also used to reverse the charges for long-distanceaccess, Notes makes the caller pay the toll.andP;  Unless, of course, the lineinto the server is an 800 number.andM;Ray Ozzie's Notes: Five Years in a BoxandM;The gesture passed with little fanfare, part of the choreographed event inwhich Lotus introduced Notes to the press and the marketplace.andP;  Larry Moore,manager of the communications product division at Lotus, stepped from behindthe podium and handed a shrink-wrapped box containing Notes to Ray Ozzie,president of Iris Associates, the company that spent five years developingNotes with Lotus's support.andM;&quot;That moment,&quot; says the 34-year-old programmer, &quot;meant more than you know.&quot;andM;Actually, Ozzie first got the inspiration for Lotus Notes 15 years ago.andP;  As astudent at the University of Illinois, he programmed on a campus computersystem called PLATO, which served as host for a wide area conferencing systemnamed PLATO Notes.andP;  &quot;PLATO Notes,c Ozzie recalls, &quot;was the first time I hadseen conferencing on a wide scale, where you could establish relationshipswith people you'd never seen, people you'd never meet.&quot;andM;Ozzie graduated and got a programming job with Data General, working onnetworking projects.andP;  In 1981 he moved to PC software pioneer Software Arts,where he helped enhance VisiCalc, the original spreadsheet.andM;While at Software Arts, Ozzie independently drew up specifications for aPC-based conferencing system and started to seek venture capital to develophis system.andP;  But before he got far, Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus, hiredhim to work on the project that eventually became Lotus Symphony.andM;&quot;I made an arrangement with Mitch that I would come over and do Symphony andshelve my plans for a while,&quot; says Ozzie.andP;  &quot;And then, when that project wasdone, he could introduce me to venture capitalists....&quot;andM;In 1984, Lotus itself wound up financing Ozzie's Iris Associates in a uniqueagreement: in return for start-up capital, Lotus got an option to obtaincomplete marketing rights to Iris's first product.andP;  Ozzie rapidly brought inprogrammers Tim Halvorsen and Len Kawell (college friends then working at theDigital Equipment Corporation).andP;  The three of them were later joined by SteveBeckhardt to form Iris's core.andM;&quot;We knew what were trying to accomplish,&quot; says Ozzie.andP;  &quot;But this waspre-everything.&quot;andP;  They hoped to build a networked PC application with agraphical user interface.andP;  There were no models to follow and few programmingtools to use in the endeavor.andM;Bit by bit, the pieces started falling into place.andP;  PC networking and userinterfaces matured, slowly.andP;  The software would ultimately see 81 revisionsand include 520,000 lines of C code.andP;  When, midway through, Lotus made anofficial, internal commitment to bring the product to market, the Iris teamgot a badly needed dose of positive feedback.andM;Still, concerns remained.andM;&quot;It wasn't obvious how to market the product,&quot; recalls Ozzie, who at DataGeneral had worked for three years on a software project that was killed formarketing reasons.andM;In the end, Lotus not only figured out how to market Notes, it created itsfirst direct-sales force just for the product.andP;  But for Ozzie and the Iristeam, nothing topped the thrill of seeing five years of work packaged andready for the world.andP;  Indeed, the day after the Lotus event, Ozzie's Notesbox sits like a trophy in the lobby of Iris's Westford, Massachusetts,office.andP;  Employees walk past it, peer at it, admire it.andM;&quot;Isn't it great?&quot; says one proud parent.andP;  &quot;We just got it yesterday.&quot;andM;What's the Best Way toandM;Configure Windows to Run Notes?andM;A whopping 490K of RAM--that's how much it takes to run the DOS version ofLotus Notes.andP;  And that's after you've loaded Windows and the network drivers.andO;So what's the best way to configure Version 2.1x of Windows/286 orWindows/386 to run Lotus Notes?andP;  There are three answers.andM;1.andP;  Don't.andP;  Run OS/2 instead.andP;  Notes performs much better under OS/2 thanunder Windows.andP;  The problem, of course, is that OS/2 needs 4MB of memory.andM;2.andP;  Don't.andP;  Wait for Windows 3.0 instead.andP;  Well-informed rumor has it thatthe new version of Windows (due any day now) will solve most of thememory-constraint problems that large Windows applications such as Notescurrently suffer, making them run faster and more smoothly.andM;3.andP;  All right, if you insist on running Notes with an earlier version ofWindows, here's what to do.andP;  Edit your CONFIG.SYS file to get rid of anyunneeded drivers.andP;  Got a tape drive or a CD-ROM player hooked up?andP;  You won'tbe able to use it anyway once you load Windows, Notes, and your networkdrivers.andP;  Be just as ruthless with your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and TSR clutter.andM;Make sure you have 2MB of memory.andP;  Then configure the second megabyte asextended memory (this step is optional, but you'll be glad if you do it).andO;Reboot your machine, then install (or reinstall) Windows.andP;  Take advantage ofthe opportunity to install both SMARTDRIVE.SYS and HIMEM.SYS.andP;  The formerwill make the best possible use of your extended memory by maintaining amemory-based cache of the disk sectors that Windows and Notes read over andover again, while the latter will give Windows up to 64K of additional RAM.andO;Or, on an 80386-based system, use Qualitas' 386-to-the-Max to convert yourupper memory to expanded memory.andM;If you're still not satisfied with Note's performance under Windows, returnto answers 1 and 2.andM;Note's Takers: Mary StarkandM;Company: Corporate Software, Inc.andM;Headquarters: Westwood, MassachusettsandM;Setup: The company has three interconnected networks, with Novell NetWare onEthernet and 150 nodes and five serves.andP;  A 7MB Notes server runs with OS/2,but there are no OS/2 workstations for Notes.andP;  Thirty to 35 people haveconcurrent access to Notes.andM;Notes' two-year beta residency at Corporate Software, a reseller of softwareand board hardware, has streamlined the production of that company'stwice-yearly software evaluation guide.andM;&quot;It's a much more organized and methodical process now,&quot; claims Mary Stark,product manager of spreadsheets.andP;  All employees on Corporate Software'sevaluation and support teams have access and editing rights to the database,for example, so evaluators receive tips on product features that they mighthave missed.andP;  Also, editors who need points clarified can track down theright author.andM;&quot;I think we're definitely going to continue to adapt it as we chance andgrow,&quot; says Stark.andP;  She predicts that the company will become more involvedin using Notes' discussion feature with the overseas offices; it's seenmostly limited use at one site.andP;  Stark calls the feature &quot;e-mail with ahistory&quot; because it preserves a series of conversations.andM;Chris Ward, manager of corporate communications, adds that discussion viaNotes is an improvement on e-mail because it makes open dialogue much easierthan e-mail packages do.andM;Will Notes Change the CultureandM;of an Organization?andM;A communications tool with the power of Notes is bound to make waves as itmoves into the office.andP;  And some critics contend that the sea of changes itwill brings may not be beneficial.andM;The first of the two most common questions is, Will a product like Notesbecome a sort of corporate Big Brother, giving managers more efficient toolswith which to examine the details of their subordinates' work, therebyaffecting working relationships and the relative autonomy of each worker?andO;The second is, Will major changes in communication bring major changes in thestructure of organizations, reducing layers of management and then flatteningthem?andM;Representatives of companies that have been testing Notes generally say theyare focusing their efforts on promoting the program as a group communicationssolution rather than as a monitoring system.andM;&quot;We're not really keeping track of where people have had problems,&quot; statesChristine Thompson of Manufacturers Hanover Trust.andP;  &quot;Our approach has beenmore to say, &quot;There proposals aren't going over well.andP;  Let's figure out whynot and see what we can do to fix that.&quot;andM;At Price Waterhouse, says Sheldon Laube, &quot;the organization is focused aroundgroups of people working together.andP;  The flow of information has always beenan intrinsic part of how we do our work,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;We like to think we'redifferent in that context.andP;  Notes then plays into one of our corporatevalues.&quot;andM;Monitoring performance isn't really a software issue, points out SusanaOpper, a groupware consultant based in New York.andP;  It's a management issue,she says, and it's not all bad.andP;  If the boss can see things in draft form inNotes before they're done, then she'll see more of what her people are doing.andO;&quot;The common cry is 'I can't get to my boss,'&quot; says Opper.andP;  &quot;With Notes, thatwonht be a problem.andP;  And lots of personnel evaluations are done on a wing anda prayer.andP;  With better access to the employee's work, that will change.&quot;andM;On the second question, Jim Manzi, president and CEO of Lotus, takes apragmatic view.andP;  &quot;The pop theory that layers of management will disappearbecause of products like Notes is just not true.andP;  You hear that middlemanagers are an endangered species, but you've got to remember that cuttingout layers of management requires managerial action, not just computeraction.andP;  there's no @ function to reorganize a company.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
