According to the Atmospheric Environment Service, these conclusionsmisrepresent the information contained in the main body of the NAPAP(National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program) report and have failedto take account of pertinent and relevant information omitted from thereport. This paper presents Canada's rebuttal to each point.</TEXT></DOC>
