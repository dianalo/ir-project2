Ross Perot.}    DETROIT -- In reviewing the harrowing 12 months since the controversial buy-out one year ago today of dissident director H. Ross Perot, General Motors Corp. officials like to point to the progress they have made.    Crucial cost-cutting programs are ahead of schedule, flashy new products are coming out, and the hourly workers have peacefully agreed to an innovative new contract.    There's just one problem. The world's No. 1 auto maker is having trouble selling cars.    So far in 1987, GM's car sales have dropped 22% from a year ago while the market as a whole fell roughly 10%. GM's share in the car market for the first 10 months of the year is 37%, four points off a year ago. And in a strong market for light trucks, GM's sales are down 6% and its market share in that category has slipped more than one point to 31.7%.    GM stock has traded so low in recent months that even before October's market crash, long-bearish securities analysts were recommending the stock as a dividend play, not because of any long-term optimism about the company's prospects. GM shares closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $56.375, down $2.125. At that price, its $5-a-share annual dividend is about 8.5%, better than many fixed income investments.    Reducing GM's bloated costs, a big issue in last year's public shoot-out with Mr. Perot, is part of the company's turnaround effort. &quot;We are improving our fundamental cost reduction and improving our basic earning power at any level of volume,&quot; says Robert T. O'Connell, GM's vice president for finance.    The other crucial element is getting its sales back up. &quot;Now there are two factors,&quot; Mr. O'Connell adds. &quot;The market itself and our penetration. . . Volume is the key.&quot;    GM executives and their supporters are confident that, with the actions they have taken, that turnaround will eventually come. &quot;I think (the drop in market share) has pretty near bottomed out,&quot; argues J. David Power, a California automotive market consultant. &quot;Once you've executed a change, it takes pretty near three or four years to get the momentum back up again.&quot;    But for now, at least, the company continues to struggle on the sales front. Quality, design and technology are improving but are still far from the best in the world. And the new models, while getting generally good reviews, are so far stealing sales from other GM models rather than from other companies. To make matters worse, the U.S. car market is heading into a downturn.    Skeptics, whose ranks have grown as numerous GM predictions have turned sour, argue there's no reason why a company shedding market share can't lose more. &quot;I don't see GM getting much back,&quot; says Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman, Selz, Mager, Dietz andamp; Birney. &quot;Stabilizing is the best they could hope for.&quot;    And the once unthinkable prospect of Ford eventually passing GM in sales isn't &quot;a laugher any more,&quot; says Philip E. Benton Jr., Ford's executive vice president in charge of world-wide automotive operations. Despite being only two-thirds of GM's size, Ford will rack up higher earnings than GM this year -- the second year in a row. &quot;GM has a couple of rough years sailing ahead,&quot; Mr. Benton notes. &quot;It has cost problems and product problems, and we may be heading into a down economy. That's the combination that hurt us so much in 1980.&quot;    In grading GM's performance over the past year, Chairman Roger B. Smith singles out cost-cutting, and gives GM an &quot;A or A-minus&quot; for that progress. Indeed, GM says it already has cut $3 billion of the $10 billion it hopes to carve out of operating costs by 1990, and already has gotten rid of 30,000 of the 40,000 white-collar jobs slated for elimination. Cost-cutting also means altering the salary schedules and the 70-year-old bonus system -- another Perot target -- to induce better performance.    Those points are important, because in some ways, cost counts as much as sales. GM's major cost-cutting efforts are geared as much to shrink GM as to make it more efficient, and the company hopes to make respectable profits even if its market share never returns to its previous highs. Indeed, David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., estimates that the cost reductions already are making a difference, contributing $2.3 billion to GM's 1987 operating profit. Even more benefits from cost reductions are buried by certain one-time charges, such as those required to buy out certain employees.    Still, for this year at least, sales are falling further than costs. Only an accounting change let GM avoid a third-quarter operating loss of $536.9 million.    GM, Mr. Smith concedes, does deserve lower marks in marketing -- a &quot;B-minus&quot; -- and market performance -- a &quot;C.&quot; He also says the extent of the market-share drop has come as a surprise. &quot;I simply do not understand,&quot; he says, how Japanese auto makers for instance have kept sales going despite their price increases due to the strong yen. But the chairman contends that the well-documented reasons for GM's decline -- chiefly a slew of sluggish, look-alike cars -- are disappearing.    In fact, some of GM's new entries have gotten good independent reviews. Chevrolet's sporty Corsica and Beretta models, as well as its pickup truck, have sold well since their introduction earlier this year. Dealers praise the new Buick Regal, introduced in early October. &quot;Just about everything we've had we've sold,&quot; says Mark Hermann, president of a Buick dealership in Yonkers, N.Y. &quot;It's great styling, priced right, and it's the best engineered car Buick has ever given us.&quot;    That car is the first in a series of GM-10 products, a new $5 billion line of mid-sized cars that will come out over the next two years. Besides that, some of this year's Oldsmobile Calais, Buick Skylark and Pontiac Grand Am models have a 16-valve engine -- GM's &quot;Quad 4&quot; -- the most sophisticated of any of the Big Three U.S. producers.    And in general, GM's quality seems to be improving. Mr. Smith gives the company an &quot;A&quot; on that score, and says some plants have progressed so far that they're doing away with quality inspectors.    But even Mr. Smith, who last January said GM's then 41% market share was &quot;abnormally low,&quot; now eschews forecasts. &quot;I see a growing penetration over 1988,&quot; he says. &quot;But where does it intersect the 40% line and what's the total for the year, I don't know.&quot;    One reason for uncertainty: the bright stars on GM's horizon illuminate as much the remaining problems as the progress. None of the new cars truly revolutionizes the market. Despite the Regal advertising claiming a major breakthrough in design, the car mainly represents a deviation of the aerodynamic look pioneered by Ford with its Taurus and Sable models two years ago. While the Regal is &quot;innovative as far as GM is concerned,&quot; as one New England dealer puts it, &quot;it isn't a showstopper.&quot;    And while the Quad 4 engines are optional on some compact cars, similar engines are standard equipment on all Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas, the entry models for the Japanese auto makers.    In fact, the new models seem mainly to sell at the expense of older GM models. Mr. Hermann of Yonkers says that last week, one of his Regal sales went to a customer originally interested in buying a Buick Century. Despite the Corsica/Beretta's highly successful opening year, Chevrolet's share of the car market has remained stuck at 13.6% as sales of mainstream cars like the Celebrity have faded.    Furthermore, GM continues to suffer from the streak of poor planning and bad luck that has plagued it for years. The high-profile Cadillac Allante, aimed at restoring that beleaguered nameplate's prestige, has stalled in sales because of quality and design problems, and a whopping $55,000 price tag. At an early November auction in Orlando, Fla., two Allantes with 4,000 miles sold for only about $38,000 each. Usually, prestige luxury cars depreciate very little. The Regal launch has been marred somewhat by a shortage of the cars, some dealers complain.    In general, GM continues to lag on concerns that matter most to car buyers. An embarrassing illustration of GM's poor image or poor marketing is New United Motors Manufacturing Inc. -- its California joint venture with Toyota Motor Co. The exact same workers using most of the same parts make Chevrolet Novas and Toyota FXs. Some surveys show the Nova has higher quality. Yet customers complain more about the Novas, and Nova sales have been far below production, while FXs are meeting projected sales.    Despite Mr. Smith's boasts of quality improvement, customers have their reservations. A May survey by Mr. Power's company of buyers of new 1987 model cars showed GM cars had 8% more problems than the industry average and was 10% behind Ford.    As sales continue their descent, rumors wax and wane about the ability of Mr. Smith to hang on until his scheduled retirement in 1990. Mr. Smith himself laughs at such talk, and insists he has the backing of the board to serve out his term: &quot;I have a lot of things that have to get done.&quot; Robert C. Stempel, who was promoted to the presidency in September, gets credit for smoothing relations between feuding staffs and generally improving morale. However, cuts and layoffs continue to damp enthusiasm among blue and white-collar workers.    It is small wonder, then, that GM is seizing whatever good news it can. Earlier this month, a GM solar-powered car won the first transcontinental World Solar Challenge in Australia. Now Mr. Smith keeps a small plastic prototype of the Sunraycer on his desk.    &quot;This victory,&quot; Mr. Smith said after the race, &quot;is yet another example of how GM teamwork and technology are multiplying the power of people to create even better GM cars and trucks of the future.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
