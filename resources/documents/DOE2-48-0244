Depending on the elementto be measured, atomisation is carried out after application of hydrogenand/or matrix modifiers in the pyrolysis stage. Detection limits (30)in serum are {le}0.2 {mu}g/l for Pb, {le}0.06 {mu}g/l for Cd, and {le}0.10{mu}g/l for Ni. The detection limit for Pb in urine was {le}6 {mu}g/l.The mean error is between 5% and 30%, depending on element and matrix.The results were verified by voltammetry after wet treatment in serumand by a new, direct method in urine.</TEXT></DOC>
