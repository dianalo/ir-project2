Arnold McKinnon, chairman, president and chief executive officer, told securities analysts here that the Norfolk, Va., concern's railroad freight traffic rose 6.2% in the latest quarter. But in the fourth quarter, he expects a narrowing of recent freight gains when compared with strong traffic in the like 1987 period.    Excluding the year-earlier charge of $620.4 million before tax, which was related to rail-restructuring costs, earnings in the 1987 third quarter would have been $103.3 million, or 55 cents a share.    Revenue increased 13% to $1.16 billion from $1.03 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Norfolk Southern closed at $30.875, up 87.5 cents.    &quot;The year started off strong for us and has improved every quarter, thanks to increasing traffic and reduced employee costs,&quot; said Mr. McKinnon. He added that although railway traffic rose in the third quarter, railway expenses remained flat.    Mr. McKinnon said that coal revenue rose 10% in the quarter while merchandise freight shipments increased 16%. The company has cut 2,649 railroad jobs during the past 12 months under the restructuring program, and expects to cut another 2,300 rail jobs by the end of 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
