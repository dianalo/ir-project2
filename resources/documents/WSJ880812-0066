That cash could be applied to the company's $1.27 billion acquisition of cable-television properties from Rogers Communications Inc., William A. Cropper, Houston Industries' treasurer, said in an interview. The acquisition would make the company, one of the nation's largest utility operators, also one of the nation's largest cable-television operators. The cable purchase is subject to regulatory approval.    But the proposed acquisition by Houston Industries, whose dominant unit is Houston Lighting andamp; Power Inc., set off sparks among consumer groups in Texas because the company's utility unit is expected to file a rate case soon to recover its share of costs in the South Texas Project, a $5.8 billion nuclear plant. The consumer groups say the company should not be contemplating a large acquisition while seeking a rate increase. The utility unit provided 94% of the parent's profit last year.    Mr. Cropper said Houston Industries retained Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. two weeks ago to locate prospective buyers for the possible sale of its Primary Fuels Inc. unit. The oil and gas unit posted profit of $4.5 million in 1987, compared with a $27.7 million loss in 1986. Its reserves, scattered from Indonesia to Argentina, from Greece to the Permian Basin of West Texas, consist of about 23 million barrels of oil and the equivalent of roughly 47 million barrels of natural gas.    But some industry officials warn that the market for oil and gas reserves may currently be glutted. While Houston Industries' expectations from the sale are in line with recent reserve transactions, a large number of other companies are also trying to sell energy reserves.    The largest number of reserves on the market are those of Tenneco Inc., but the long list also includes Texaco Inc. and Transco Inc. Enron Corp. recently pulled its sizable oil and gas reserves off the market when it couldn't get a satisfactory price.    Reaction to the planned cable acquisition came swiftly from consumer groups, who are already hatching battle plans to fight &quot;rate shock&quot; from Houston Lighting andamp; Power Co. and Central Power andamp; Light Co., the dominant unit of Dallas-based Central andamp; South West Corp. and one of four South Texas Project partners.    The nuclear plant, plagued by cost overruns, must run at 100% power for 100 consecutive hours before it is declared commercially operable. That commercial status triggers the filing of rate cases. The 100 hours of testing was snagged at the 70-hour mark last Saturday when a fuse blew on one of three pumps on the nonnuclear side of the plant.    &quot;Stockholders should bear more of the brunt of the South Texas nuclear plant,&quot; said Robert Rivera, a member of one Houston consumer group. &quot;We are dismayed that {Houston Industries} is able to make this kind of acquisition and not take more responsibility for STP.&quot;    But a company spokeswoman said distinctions should be made between shareholders' money and ratepayers' money. The utility unit can &quot;cover legitimate costs and service and earn a fair rate of return&quot; by law, she said. &quot;Lowering rates with shareholders' money is not an option.&quot;    Mr. Cropper, the treasurer, said that shareholders can expect profits in about four years from the expanded cable properties. The company's current cable operation, Denver-based Paragon Communications, has had losses of about $17 million in the two years it has been owned by Houston Industries. The Rogers properties have been unprofitable because of capital depreciation costs from investments from 1979 to 1986 in what is a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; system, Mr. Cropper said.    Nearly 80% of the cable industry provides subscribers with fewer than 36 channels, Mr. Cropper said, while all of the Rogers properties provide more capacity, including two markets where capacity reaches 108 channels. The crown jewel of the acquisition is the San Antonio market, he said, because there is no competition.    Houston Industries will also add Laredo to its existing Texas markets of El Paso and the Dallas area. The company will also be able to expand in the Los Angeles area, as well as enter the Portland, Ore., and Minneapolis markets. The new properties would give Houston Industries a combined total of 1.2 million cable subscribers. </TEXT></DOC>
