(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Optical Disk Subsytems Gain Momentum as Storage AlternativesandM;Recent price reductions, performance enhancements and product introductionshave made erasable and write-once, read-many (WORM) optical disk subsystemsmore viable alternatives to magnetic disk and magnetic tape subsystems.andM;According to market analysts, optical storage is becoming increasinglyattractive to buyers who want to maintain large online data archives, executeefficient random data seeks, and who need disks that are removable and havelong shelf lives.andM;The most significant optical development is the substantial increase in thenumber of erasable drives and subsystems that are now available.andP;  Just oneyear ago, only Sony offered DEC-compatible erasable optical products.andP;  Allother subsystem offerings incorporated WORM drives.andP;  WORM disks have largediameters that provide substantial single-disk storage capacities, but theyaren't erasable, which many mass storage buyers consider a major drawback.andM;Now, however, 10 vendors offer erasable optical disk drives, and drives fromfour of those suppliers--Maxoptix, Ricoh, Sony and Summus--are available inDEC-compatible optical disk subsystems.andP;  In addition, several Japanesecompanies, including Fujitsu, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Sanyo and Toshiba, haveannounced their intention to offer erasable optical drives.andP;  Thesedevelopments should ensure a steady decrease in the prices of erasableoptical disks and drives.andM;Although buyers seem increasingly eager to acquire optical storage products,to date DEC has introduced only the RV-20 series of 12-inch WORM drives,which are available for all DEC I/O buses.andP;  Because its subsystem offeringsare limited to essentially the same drive coupled with different hostadapters.andP;  DEC hasn't become a major player in the growing price/performanceraces among optical disk subsystem vendors.andM;The first question facing any optical buyer is, obviously, why buy optical?andO;With seek times in the neighborhood of 120 milliseconds (ms) and throughputrates averaging 360KB per second, erasable and WORM optical drives areconsiderably slower than magnetic disk drives.andP;  WORM drives also lack eraseand rewrite capabilities.andP;  But market analysts expect optical drive designsto improve in the next five years, enabling optical subsystems to deliverbetter performance, perhaps approaching that of magnetic disk drives.andM;Even given current drawbacks, optical disk subsystems offer a number ofadvantages.andP;  Optical disk drives are often chosen by buyers concerned aboutdata security, because optical disk drives can accommodate massive amounts ofdata in compact containers that can be removed easily and stored in safes.andO;Optical disks are small and lightweight, especially in comparison toremovable magnetic disk drives, which can sometimes be large and heavy, notto mention considerably more expensive than their optical drive counterparts.andM;In addition, optical disk drives are ideal for rugged environments such asindustrial shop floors.andP;  Optical disks can withstand temperature extremes andrapid temperature shifts, and the optical drive's read/write head nevertouches the media, so head crashes never occur.andM;Optical storage devices also have two other significant advantages over tapesubsystems.andP;  First, vendors estimate that an optical disk's shelf life rangesfrom 10 to as long as 50 years, making optical disks ideal for long-termarchiving without risking data degradation.andP;  Magnetic tape, by contrast, islimited to an average shelf life of about two years or, in rare cases, asmany as five years.andM;Second, optical disk drives can seek random locations on a disk.andP;  Digitalaudiotape (DAT) drives are the only magnetic tape devices that offer randomaccess to tape locations, and their performance slows considerably whenperforming random seeks.andP;  Data throughput and seek times are sometimes asmuch as 100 times slower for DAT drives than for optical drives.andM;Still, magnetic tape and disk subsystems are better bets in regard to costper megabyte of on-line storage.andP;  For a storage configuration that includes adrive, controller and one piece of media with a 1.5GB storage capacity, an8mm drive would average $4 per on-line megabyte, a magnetic disk drive wouldaverage about $8 per megabyte and an erasable optical drive would top thelist at $20 per megabyte, said Tom Trimarchi, president of Trimarchi.andM;Bob Abraham, vice president of Freeman Associates, a market research company,based in Santa Barbara, Calif., said he expects optical drive prices to beginmoving downward in the near future.andM;Market analysts also expect optical media prices to decline during the nextyear.andP;  Rewritable and WORM 5-1/4-inch optical disk cartridge prices rangefrom around $100 to $400.andP;  Most analysts predicted, however, that opticalmedia prices will drop below $100 by 1991.andP;  Steven Jobs, president of Next ofPalo Alto, Calif., whose NeXT Computer System uses a Canon rewritable opticaldisk drive, has predicted that the OEM cost for rewritable optical disks willeventually drop as low as $20.andM;INTERCHANGEABLE ISSUESandM;Another area where optical disk subsystems lag behind the mass storagealternatives involves data interchange.andP;  In the tape world, nine-track drivesare the de facto interchange standard, and other tape technologies, such asdrives using IBM's 3480-style recording technique, are vying to usurpnine-track's central interchange role.andM;WORM optical drives, however, have historically suffered from a lack ofstandards.andP;  Having seen WORM drive vendors struggle for want of standards,erasable disk manufacturers have hurried to develop data exchange standardsearly on.andP;  But at present, erasable disks are far from interchangeable.andM;For instance, DR Labs recently tested Trimarchi's two Laserase erasableoptical disk subsystems; one uses a Ricoh erasable drive, and the other aSony erasable drive.andP;  (The Ricoh-based subsystem costs less but offersslightly slower performance.)andP;  DR Labs found that the disk cartridge writtenusing the Sony drive could not be read by the Ricoh drive.andP;  Both the Ricohand Sony drives are said to adhere to the International StandardsOrganization erasable disk standard, and both used the same 3M datacartridge.andM;By contrast, any nine-track tape written with 1,600 bits per inch can be readby any nine-track tape machine reading at 1,600 bits per inch and running thesame host operating system.andP;  In addition, with the aid of translationsoftware it's possible to exchange nine-track tapes between dissimilaroperating systems.andM;With the aid of translation software, limited interchange of optical disksbetween similar and foreign operating systems is possible, but there aregreater hardware limitations than with tape interchange.andP;  Without specialsoftware, &quot;no optical technology has yet achieved any level of interchange,and they are years and years from it,&quot; Freeman Associates' Abraham said.andM;According to Richard Gardener, vice president at Alphatronix, an Alphatronixsoftware package called Bypass, available for $1,000 on DEC Q-bus or Unibussystems, translates data from one operating system into terms a foreign hostcan accept and understand, if the same Alphatronix erasable drive model isemployed by both hosts.andP;  At present, the software supports only VMS and DOS,but a version is being developed for Sun Microsystems' SunOS operatingsystem.andM;WORM OR ERASABLE?andM;Once the decision to purchase an optical drive has been made, the choicebetween a WORM or erasable subsystem still remains.andP;  The most obviousshortcoming of WORM drives is that data can't be erased and rewritten.andP;  Butaccording to some vendors, that can actually be an advantage for some users.andM;WORM drives are well suited for archiving and legal purposes preciselybecause they don't allow data to be rewritten, said Jim DeVoy, manager ofapplication engineering at Laser Magnetic Storage.andP;  &quot;Many legal sites chooseWORM, feeling that their documents are safer from tampering,&quot; DeVoy said.andP;  Headded that the choice between WORM and erasable drives &quot;is basicallyapplication-dependent.&quot;andM;Other vendors disagreed.andP;  Trimarchi's Trimarchi noted that &quot;although WORMdisks cannot be rewritten, the data can be destroyed.&quot;andP;  In other words, datarecorded on a WORM disk is safe from alteration, but not from destruction.andM;The binary digits of data on WORM disks are recorded in pits along the disk'ssurface, and data is recorded by specific sequencing of pitted and non-pittedsurfaces.andP;  &quot;Depending on how you look at it.&quot;andP;  Trimarchi explained, &quot;a pitcan represent either a one or a zero.&quot;andP;  A pitted disk surface can't besmoothed over, and thus can't be erased.andP;  But a laser could be used to pitthe entire surface of an already pitted WORM disk, effectively destroying allrecorded data.andM;MAGNETO-OPTIC ADVANTAGEandM;Rewritability is the principal advantage of erasable drives.andP;  AllDEC-compatible erasable models currently record data using magneto-optictechnology, which combines a magnetic recording method with the same opticaltechnology that WORM drives use.andP;  In erasable drives, a laser heats the disksurface to enable it to accept a magnetic field that can change its polarity.andO;Positive and negative magnetic fields, as opposed to a WORM disk's pits, arethen created to represent data.andM;On the downside, magneto-optic technology causes a lot of wear because thelaser melts the disk interior wherever data is recorded.andP;  In addition, themagneto-optic drive must erase an optical disk spot before rewriting to it,which slows write times.andP;  According to George Johnson, senior researchphysicist at Philips and DuPont Optical, a Wilmington, Del., vendor currentlydeveloping a reversible-phase-change optical drive, the inability to rewritedirectly to the disk without first erasing &quot;will be the death knell ofmagneto-optic.&quot;andM;Reversible-phase-change and dye-polymer technologies are erasable opticalrecording methods that aren't commercially available in the DEC-compatiblemarket but have recently begun to generate excitement.andM;Reversible-phase-change drives use a pulsed laser to read the surface of thedisk media, and a circular laser is used to rewrite the disk.andP;  In thedye-polymer method, different wavelengths of laser light are used to read andwrite data.andP;  Both technologies allow faster write times than magneto-opticdisks because no disk erasing is involved.andM;There are drawbacks, however.andP;  Both methods change the characteristics of theoptical disk repeatedly, shortening its usable life.andP;  &quot;These technologies areradical changes,&quot;  Alphatronix's Gardener said.andP;  In addition, thesetechnologies are still one to five years away from reaching theDEC-compatible market.andM;As for performance, DR Labs tests have revealed a major shortcoming of someWORM drives.andP;  In running our standard suite of disk benchmarks, we found thatthroughput and access times for tested WORM drives were considerably belowthose of the erasable drives we benchmarked.andP;  (See &quot;Combining Forces,&quot; Sept.andO;4, page 35, and &quot;Giving Your Data a Longer Shelf Life,&quot; Oct. 16, page 29.)andM;We obtained a throughput as high as 358KB per second for the erasable drives,whereas the WORM drives never topped 163KB per second.andP;  Similarly, accesstimes for the erasable drives were as low as 123ms, whereas the WORM drivesreached 279ms.andM;Because they are removable, optical drives are often used as off-linestorage, for which performance may not be a major buying criterion.andP;  Thedifference is so significant, however, that buyers should fully evaluatetheir performance needs before purchasing a WORM drive.andM;On the other hand, WORM drives have the advantage of having disks as large as14 inches in diameter, whereas erasable drive disks all have 5-1/4-inchdiameters.andP;  Larger diameters increase the surface area available for writing,which in turn greatly increases the amount of data that can be stored on onedisk.andM;Despite their drawbacks, WORM drives are outshipping erasable ones.andP;  WORMdrives have been available much longer and from more sources than erasabledrives, Freeman Associates' Abraham said, and have therefore gained greatermarket acceptance.andP;  Indeed, some vendors attributed slow erasable subsystemsales to the inherent fear and hesitancy corporate buyers have whencontemplating new and less familiar technologies.andM;According to a Freeman Associates market study, unit shipments of WORM driveswill surpass erasable shipments through 1991.andP;  By 1993, the study predicted,erasable drive unit sales will begin to edge ahead of WORM shipments.andM;Most market analysts agreed that optical storage will figure prominently inthe future of data storage, but they didn't concur about its precise role.andO;Some said optical disk subsystems will be used for primary storage, whileothers contended that optical storage is too slow to be suitable for anythingbut on-line archiving.andM;Clearly, optical disk storage hasn't yet been established as ano-questions-asked alternative to magnetic disk and tape subsystems, butbuyers are increasingly considering the optical option.andP;  Offeringremovability, high capacity and long-life media, optical disk subsystemsprovide an excellent storage alternative today, and hold great promise forthe mass storage future.andM;BUYER'S TIPSandM;1 Shop for optical disk subsystems that use erasable drives, unless your sitespecifically requires a WORM drive.andP;  Erasable disks offer higher throughput,faster access times and rewritability.andM;2 If security is an issue, you may want to consider WORM optical drives.andP;  Butremember that although data recorded on WORM drives can't be altered, it canbe destroyed.andM;3 Know your storage needs.andP;  If you intend to use optical disk subsystemsmostly for off-line storage, for instance, you should make storage capacity amore important buying criterion than drive performance.andM;4 If you anticipate a need to exchange archived data with other sites, bewary of optical disk drives that don't adhere to proposed standards.andP;  Theirincompatibility with other drives may prove problematic once standards areadopted.andM;5 Shop for the best price by comparing each subsystem's drive model andmanufacturer.andP;  Most subsystem vendors buy optical drives from the same drivevendors, then add features such as host operating software or productsupport.andM;6 Compare the types and costs of product support each vendor provides, andmake sure you understand what the warranties cover.andP;  These factors may makeor break your optical disk subsystem buying decisions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
