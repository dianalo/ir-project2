A government report yesterday morning showing thatconsumer prices rose only 0.2% last month sparked a briefbond-market rally. That was the mildest increase sinceSeptember and was slightly less than the 0.3% rise manyanalysts expected.</LP><TEXT>   But the rally didn't last long, partly because of growingconcern about the nation's huge budget deficit. Several moneymanagers and bond traders are worried about the lack ofprogress so far in budget talks between Bush administrationofficials and congressional leaders.   Prices of actively traded Treasury notes and bonds endedthe day unchanged to slightly lower. Long-term governmentbonds fell about 1/8 point, or about $1.25 for each $1,000face amount. Short-term Treasury bill rates were flat.   Washington's growing budget woes are &quot;not a positive forthe bond markets,&quot; said William Brachfeld, executive vicepresident and head of fixed-income securities trading atDaiwa Securities America Inc. He said several Daiwa clientshere and in Japan &quot;are increasingly concerned&quot; about thefailure so far of the White House and congressional leadersto agree on a big deficit-reduction package.   The budget talks are being watched closely because anaccord could mean less government borrowing and might evenencourage the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates. TheFed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee,met Tuesday to review strategy.   Until recently, many analysts had expected the Fed toraise short-term rates in an effort to fight an inflationproblem that appeared to be growing. But those worriesevaporated quickly following a string of government reportsshowing unexpectedly weak business activity and lessinflation than generally feared. Now, the consensus is thatthe Fed will hold short-term rates steady in coming weeks.   However, the Treasury's borrowing needs remain huge, andinvestors received a fresh reminder of this yesterday.   The Treasury said it will sell $10.8 billion of newtwo-year notes Wednesday, followed Thursday by the sale of$8.5 billion of notes due in five years and two months. Thesize of these two sales was &quot;bigger than expected,&quot; saidKevin Flanagan, money-market economist at Dean WitterReynolds Inc. &quot;It eclipsed even our gloomy expectations.&quot;   Mr. Flanagan and other analysts worry that the Treasury'sborrowing needs could be exacerbated by the thrift bailoutand a growing federal deficit. &quot;Things don't look that rosyfor next year&quot; for the budget deficit, Mr. Flanagan said.   Late yesterday, the new two-year notes were quoted inwhen-issued trading at 8.55%, while the new five-year,two-month notes were trading at about 8.60%.   Fed officials probably won't make any credit policychanges at least until early next month, after the release ofMay employment statistics, several analysts said. The Aprilemployment report, released earlier this month, showed muchsmaller employment gains than expected.   Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.International Inc., said the bond market appears to be &quot;onhold&quot; until the May jobs report. Until then, Treasury bondyields are likely to hover between 8.55% and 8.75%, he said.                                                                                                          Corporate Issues                                                                                                          Lured by lower borrowing costs, two more largecorporations tapped the bond market.   Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., the Chicago-based retailer, was thebiggest borrower in the corporate debt market with a $400million offering of new three-year notes. The non-callablenotes were priced to yield 9.387%. Underwriters led byGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. boosted the size of the issue from $300million in response to strong investor demand.   Desmond Wong, corporate finance director at Sears, saidthe company decided to tap the market after the consumerprice report showed an unexpectedly small increase ininflation last month. &quot;In our case, we just saw theopportunity when the consumer price index was announced andthe market was stable,&quot; he said. &quot;We are getting a coupon of9.35%, and for a three-year, we think that's a good level forus.&quot;   Separately, Maytag Corp. sold $200 million of 12-yeardebentures. Thomas Ringgenberg, treasurer at Maytag, said theappliance maker had been seeking to tap the market for sometime. However, &quot;it was really last Friday's PPI {producerprice index} number that caused {yields on} Treasurys to comedown within our range&quot; and prompted Maytag to issue debt, hesaid. Maytag's 12-year debentures were priced to yield9.814%.   Nevertheless, many other corporate treasurers are waitingon the sidelines for lower rates before they tap the market.   &quot;It's going to take a long {Treasury} bond range ofbetween 8 3/8% and 8 1/2% to bring a lot of corporatetreasurers in,&quot; said James Quigley of Merrill Lynch CapitalMarkets. The Treasury's 30-year bonds yielded about 8 5/8% asof late yesterday.   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, corporateissues closed between 1/8 and 1/4 point lower. In the junkbond market, high-yield issues, or bonds withbelow-investment-grade ratings, ended the day mixed.   Among the junk bonds that advanced were issues ofOwens-Illinois Inc. as investors were encouraged by thecompany's first-quarter earnings report. But among the biglosers in the market were junk bonds of Burlington HoldingsInc., which slipped about 1/2 point on average.                                                                                                          Mortgage-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities fell 1/32 to 5/32 point, but mostissues held up better than Treasurys despite talk that theResolution Trust Corp. sold as much as $1 billion of mortgageissues.   The RTC, the government conservator for failed thrifts,has stepped up its sales of mortgage securities in recentweeks as it seeks to resolve the situations of 141 thrifts bythe end of the quarter.   While the RTC was a rumored seller, there also was strongdemand for mortgage securities.   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities forJune delivery ended at 95 18/32, down 2/32; 9 1/2% securitieswere at 97 30/32, down 3/32; 10% securities were at 10013/32, down 1/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2%securities were at 97 1/2, down 5/32.   The Ginnie Mae 10% issue was supported by the issuance ofa $500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backedby 10% securities via Salomon Brothers Inc.   The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.78% to a 12-yearaverage life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.12.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          After a brief early-morning rally, Treasury bond pricesreversed direction, finishing the day with slight declines.   The government's benchmark 30-year bond initially rose to101 19/32, a gain of about 1/4 point from Tuesday. But bylate in the afternoon, the price had fallen to 101 6/32, toyield 8.63%.

However, prices of two-year Treasury notes inched higher,helped by rumors that an institution had purchased a largeamount of the latest two-year issue and sold a similar-sizedblock of long-term bonds. The two-year notes rose 1/32 pointto 100 19/32 to yield 8.51%.                                                                                                          Municipals                                                                                                          Tax-exempt issues ended mostly unchanged to off 1/8 pointwith some issues trading down 1/4 in a moderately activesession.   In new-issue activity, $266 million in debt was priced,following more than $1 billion on Tuesday.   In related activity, Moody's Investors Service Inc.confirmed its single-A-1 rating on Nassau County's generalobligation bonds, citing the New York county's &quot;strong,diverse and affluent economic base&quot; that provides&quot;fundamental credit strength.&quot; The confirmation came ahead ofthe sale today of $85.1 million of various purpose bonds viacompetitive bid.
