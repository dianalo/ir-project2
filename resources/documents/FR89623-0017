Such unauthorizedacts may violate laws or regulations. Therefore, unauthorized commitmentsshould be considered as serious employee misconduct and consideration givento initiating disciplinary action. If suspected irregularities may involvefraud against the Government, or any type of misconduct that might be punishableas a criminal offense, either the employee's supervisor or the contractingofficer must immediately report the matter to the Office of the InspectorGeneral with a request for a complete investigation.

Under exceptional circumstances, such as when the personwho made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available to attest tothe circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, the contracting directormay waive the requirement that the responsible employee initiate and documentthe request for ratification, provided that a written determination ismade stating that a commitment was in fact made by an employee, who mustbe identified in the determination.  (3) The contracting director will assign the request to a contracting officerfor processing. The contracting officer shall prepare a summary statementof facts addressing the limitations in FAR 1.602-3(c) recommending whetheror not the transaction should be ratified.

If the clause is included inthe solicitation for other reasons, a statement to identify either thecomponent parts (described by brand name or equal descriptions) to whichthe clause applies, or those to which it does not apply, must be includedin the solicitation. This also applies to accessories related to an enditem where a brand name or equal purchase description of the accessoriesis a part of the description of an end item. Brand name or equal descriptionsmay not be used to procure a particular product under the guise of a competitiveprocurement to the exclusion of other products meeting minimum needs.

In multiple award schedule solicitationsdelivery times will usually be stated as ``desired'' and offerors willindicate a definite number of days for delivery. (b) The contracting officer must be satisfied that the requisitioning officehas justified, in writing, an unusually short time of delivery. This isparticularly important where the time specified is so short that it maylimit competition and possibly result in higher prices. Examples of justificationsare: (1) Furniture is required to outfit quarters scheduled for occupancy ona specific date; (2) Construction material is required to meet job progress schedules; and(3) Supplies are required at a port to meet scheduled ship departures. (c) When a portion of the total delivery is needed early, the contractingofficer should:  (1) Consider requiring that portion by the early date and the balance later;and  (2) Determine whether the portion required early and the balance shouldbe included as separate items in the same solicitation or whether the twoportions should be procured separately. (d) When a solicitation contains a mixture of items that require differenttimes for delivery, the delivery periods should be set forth separatelyand items with similar delivery time requirements should be grouped accordingto delivery times in the solicitation. (e) In negotiations for multiple award schedules, the contracting officershould secure the best possible delivery time regardless of the ``desired''delivery time(s) in the solicitation. For example, some offers comply withthe Government's desired delivery time but others cite delivery times whichare substantially shorter. The former should be negotiated to bring themin line with the latter. Variable delivery time offers (e.g., 30-90 days)should be negotiated to keep the timespan to a minimum.

(See also the definition of a ``lineitem'' in FAR 3.302.)  (b) <T3>Justification for use.</T3>  (1) While ordinarily prices are solicitedon an individual line item basis, it sometimes may be in the Government'sbest interest to combine two or more line items for an aggregate awardsuch as when_(i) Uniformity of design, style, and finish is desired, as in the acquisitionof suites of household furniture;  (ii) The articles being acquired will be assembled and used as a unit,and may not be interchangeable if acquired from different manufacturers; (iii) The demand for certain articles is large, but the demand for othersimilar articles is not sufficient to attract competitive bids unless awardedin conjunction with the high-demand articles (e.g., various sizes of socketwrenches); (iv) One location (delivery point) has a large requirement, and anotherlocation has a requirement that is too small to individually attract competitivebids; or  (v) It is impractical to award and administer numerous small contractsfor similar articles or services.  (2) Before deciding to combine items for aggregate award, the contractingofficer shall include in the contract file the rationale for establishingan aggregate award formula, which must: (i) Address the capability of bidders to furnish the types and quantitiesof supplies or services in the aggregate as well as the impact on biddersif different delivery points are grouped; and (ii) Be capable of accurately projecting the lowest overall cost to theGovernment. (3) Line items may not be grouped for award on an aggregate basis whenit would: (i) Preclude a significant number of firms from bidding due to an inabilityto provide all the types or quantities of supplies or services or to makedeliveries to the various delivery points included in the prospective aggregategroup; or (ii) Increase overall prices to the Government by restricting significantlythe number of eligible bidders for any other reason (see also 514.271-3). (4) To determine the lowest cost on an aggregate group of items, it isnecessary to extend unit prices by accurate weight factors calculated toreflect the true or proportionate quantities that will be purchased undera resultant contract (see 514.271-2). If weight factors must be based uponunreliable or conjectural information, or where reliable estimates on anticipatedquantities are not available, the price list method described in 514.272should be considered. (5) If accurate weight factors and pre-established list prices are notavailable, an aggregate award formula should not be used because it couldresult in unbalanced bids and/or award could not be assured to result inthe lowest overall cost to the Government.(c) <T3>Evaluation factors for award. </T3>When items will be awarded on anaggregate basis, the solicitation must clearly state the basis on whichbids will be evaluated. (1) If weight factors are used, bidders shall be required to submit a priceon each item within the group with award to be made to the responsive andresponsible bidder whose computed overall price for the aggregate groupof items is actually the lowest or can accurately be projected to resultin the lowest overall cost to the Government. Failure to submit a priceon each item within a group will make the bid ineligible for award withregard to that group of items. (2) If the price method is used, bidders shall be required to express pricesas a percentage to be added to or subtracted from the list price for eachgroup of items with award to be made to the responsive and responsiblebidder whose percentage factor produces the most favorable price to theGovernment.  <ITAG tagnum="80">514.271-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Weighting of items for aggregate award.  </ITAG>(a) Unless the same weight factor is applicable to all line items in theaggregate group, accurate weight factors are essential for determiningwhich bid would result in the lowest overall cost to the Government forthe aggregate group.  (b) While the phrase ``lowest overall cost to the Government'' is usedin this regulation, it is not always necessary that an aggregate awardformula be capable of projecting actual cost. It is sufficient if the relativeproportionate cost between line items within the aggregate group can beprojected accurately, i.e., actual quantities may not be available, butratios of the requirements within the line items in the aggregate groupare available.  (c) Estimated quantities that apply to indefinite quantity or requirementscontracts may be reduced to smaller numbers by a common denominator tofacilitate the computations involved in evaluating bids, if doing so doesnot sacrifice precision. (d) Actual purchase quantities will be used as weight factors for definitequantity acquisitions because a bidder might include two or more aggregategroups, or an aggregate group and various individual line items, underan ``all or none'' qualification. Proportionate weight factors must notbe used in the evaluation process where ``all or none'' qualificationsare permitted. (e) Weight factors may not be based on the estimated dollar value of purchases.If the dollar value of previous purchases is the only information available,and there is no recourse but to make award on an aggregate basis, the valueof previous purchases must be converted to quantities for the purpose ofestablishing weight factors (i.e., divide total purchases of each itemby the unit price to determine number of units purchased). <ITAG tagnum="80">514.271-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Grouping of line items for aggregate award.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>While paragraphs (b) and (c) pertain to supply contracts(articles and delivery points), the same principles apply to service contracts(types of services and service areas).  (b) <T3>Grouping of different articles. </T3>Only related articles, normallymanufactured or produced by a majority of prospective bidders, should beincluded in an aggregate group. The grouping of unrelated articles usuallyis contrary to 514.271-1(b)(3). (c) <T3>Grouping of geographic locations or delivery point. </T3>The contractingofficer should consider the following guidelines before deciding to groupdifferent geographic locations or delivery points for aggregate award: (1) If different delivery points have sufficient requirements so that individualshipments to each point will involve not only economic production runs,but carload or truckload quantities, these points should be listed as separateline items. (2) The types of bidders (i.e., small or large firms, manufacturers ordistributors, etc.) responding to previous solicitations are an importantconsideration. For example, if previous bidders are distributors havingfranchises within certain territories, the grouping of different territorieswould tend to restrict competition.  (3) The impact of transportation costs on competition and pricing, sincetransporation costs may constitute a signficant portion of the total deliveredcost. Depending upon the supplies being acquired:(i) Grouping widespread geographic locations or delivery points may reducecompetition and/or result in higher prices due to the loss of ``area pricing''advantages when a potential supplier has a single production point.  (ii) Conversely, for many smaller commercial items (hand tools, locks,etc.) manufacturers may quote the same price for delivery anywhere in theU.S. (iii) Contracting officers should obtain the advice and assistance of transportationspecialists before grouping geographic locations or delivery points, toinclude information regarding the location of tariff boundaries. <ITAG tagnum="80">514.272 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Price list method.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The price list method may be used to avoid unbalancedbidding in requirements and indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contractswhen aggregate awards will be made and accurate estimates of anticipatedquantities are unavailable. This method utilizes pre-established list pricesfor acquiring groups of similar items, services, or repairs and alterations.The following elements of the price list method must be included in thesolicitation: (1) A pre-established price list. (2) An estimate of requirements, if available.  (3) A requirement that a bidder express its price as ``net'' or as a percentageadded to or subtracted from the list prices for each group.  (4) The percentage factor in (a)(3) of this section is a price relatedfactor, which must be identified in Section M of the Uniform Contract Format.(b) <T3>Development of pre-established list prices. </T3>(1) Pre-establishedlist prices may be developed by one or more of the following methods: (i) Industry published prices. (ii) Industry surveys. (iii) Government cost estimates based upon knowledge of the supplies orservices to be grouped and previous contract prices.(2) When proposed list prices will be used for the first time, prospectivebidders should be given an opportunity to review the proposed list andfurnished information on how the list prices will be used. Copies of thedraft solicitation may be provided.(3) The contracting officer must ensure that items are properly groupedand that the list prices for the grouped items bear a reasonable and balancedrelationship to one another. Before using prices resulting from awardsmade under the weighted item method to develop price lists, those pricesmust be reviewed to ensure that they did not result from unbalanced bidding.<ITAG tagnum="80">514.272-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Supply contracts.</ITAG>(a) Estimated requirements for each item in a group or for the entire groupmust be shown in the solicitation.

The contracting officershall measure the Contractor Effort by the assignment of a profit percentagewithin the designated weight ranges to each element of cost recognized.<ITAG tagnum="80">515.905-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Common factors.</ITAG>(a) The categories under Contractor Effort are broad and basic. Individualproposals may be in a different format.(b) After computing a total dollar profit for Contractor Effort, the contractingofficer shall calculate the specific profit dollars for the categoriesunder other factors. This is done by multiplying the total Government costobjective, exclusive of any cost of money for facilities capital, by thespecific weights assigned to the elements within the Other Factors category. (c) In determining the value of each factor, the contracting officer shouldbe governed by the definition, description, and purpose of the factorstogether with considerations for evaluating them as prescribed in FAR 15.905-1and the following: (1) <T3>General management. </T3>Management problems surface in various degreesand the management expertise exercised to solve them should be consideredas an element of profit. For example, a new program for an item that involvesadvanced state of the art techniques may cause more problems and requiremore managerial time and abilities of a higher order than one that is afollow-on contract. If new contracts create more problems and require ahigher profit weight, follow-ons should be adjusted downward, as many ofthe problems should have been solved. An evaluation should be made of theunderlying managerial effort involved on a case-by-case basis.(2) <T3>Other-costs. </T3>Include all other direct costs of contractor performanceunder this item (e.g., travel and relocation, direct support, and consultants).Analysis of these costs in assigning profit weights must include (i) theirsignificance, (ii) their nature, and (iii) how much they contribute tocontract performance.(3) <T3>Contract-cost-risk. </T3>Where the proper contract type has been selected,the reward for risk by contract type would usually fall into the followingranges:<ITAG tagnum="38">Cost-reimbursement type contracts</ITAG>..... 0-3% <ITAG tagnum="38">Fixed-price type contracts</ITAG>..... 3-7%(i) A cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract normally would not justify a rewardfor risk in excess of 0 percent, unless the contract contains cost riskfeatures such as ceilings on overheads. In such cases, up to 1 percentmay be justified. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts fill the remainingportion of the 0 to 3 percent range with weightings directly related tosuch factors as confidence in target cost, share ratio of fee(s), etc.The weight range for fixed-price contracts is wide enough to accommodatethe many types of fixed-price arrangements. Weighting should indicate thecost risk assumed, with only firm fixed-price contracts reaching the topend of the range.(ii) The contractor's subcontracting program may significantly impact thecontractor's risk under a contract. It could affect risk in terms of bothcost and performance. This should be a part of the contracting officer'soverall evaluation in selecting a weight for cost risk. The prime contractormay effectively transfer cost risk to a subcontractor and the risk evaluationmay, as a result, be below the range that would otherwise apply for thecontract type being proposed. The risk evaluation should not be lowered,however, merely because a substantial portion of the contract cost representssubcontracts without any substantial transfer of contractor's risk. (iii) In evaluating risk in the definitization of letter contracts, unpricedchange orders, and unpriced orders under basic ordering agreements, theeffect on risk as a result of partial performance before definitizationshould be considered. Under some circumstances the total risk may havebeen effectively reduced. Under other circumstances, the contractor's riskmay have remained substantially unchanged. To be equitable, the determinationof a profit weight for all recognized costs, both those incurred and thoseyet to be expended, must be made with consideration to all attendant circumstances,not just to the portion of costs incurred or percentage of work completedbefore definitization. (iv) Service contracts should have a weight range for cost risk of 0 to4 percent. A firm fixed-price contract, which is not priced on a labor-hourmethod, may warrant additional consideration for contractor cost risk.In those circumstances, a weight of up to 4 percent is authorized. Conversely,a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee service contract normally warrants a zero costrisk factor. (4) <T3>Capital investment. </T3>The evaluation of this factor for profit weightsshould include the following:  (i) <T3>Facilities. </T3>To evaluate how this factor contributes to the profitobjective requires knowledge of the level of facilities use needed forcontract performance, the source of financing of the facilities, and theoverall cost effectiveness of the facilities offered. Contractors who furnishtheir own facilities that significantly contribute to lower total contractcosts, should receive additional profit. Contractors who rely on the Governmentto provide or finance facilities should receive less profit. Situationsbetween the above examples should be evaluated on their merits with eithera positive or negative profit weight adjustment, as appropriate, beingmade. However, when a contractor who owns a large quantity of facilitiesis to perform a contract that does not benefit from these facilities, orwhere a contractor's use of its facilities has a minimum cost impact onthe contract, profit need not be adjusted. (ii) <T3>Payments. </T3>The frequency of payments by the Government to the contractorshould be considered. The key to this weighting is the impact the contractwill have on the contractor's cash flow. Generally, for payments more frequentthan monthly, negative consideration should be given, with maximum reductionas the contractor's working capital approaches zero. Positive considerationshould be given for payments less frequent than monthly with additionalconsideration given for payments less frequent than the contractor's orthe industry's normal practice. (5) <T3>Cost control and other past accomplishments. </T3>See FAR 15.905-1(e). (6) <T3>Federal socio economic programs. </T3>See FAR 15.905-1(c). (7) <T3>Special situations and independent development. </T3>See FAR 15.905-1(f).<ITAG tagnum="80">515.905-70 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Nonprofit organizations. </ITAG>(a) The structured approach was designed for arriving at profit or feeobjectives for other than nonprofit organizations. However, the structured approach as modified below, should also be used to establish fee objectivesfor nonprofit organizations. (See FAR 31.701.)

This type of plan may apply to the productionof the offeror's entire company, or it may be limited to a division orplant. ``Individual contract plan'' means a subcontracting plan that applies toa specific contract and that has goals which are based upon the company'splanned subcontracting and purchasing of supplies and services in supportof the performance of a specific contract, except that indirect costs incurredfor common or joint purposes may be allocated on a prorated basis to thecontract. Individual contract plans may incorporate a master subcontractingplan. ``Master subcontracting plan'' means a subcontracting plan which containsall of the required elements except goals, and which may be incorporatedinto an individual plan provided (a) the master plan has been approvedby a Government contracting officer, (b) the offeror provides a copy ofthe approved master plan and evidence of its approval to the contractingofficer and (c) goals and any deviations from the master plan are approvedby the contracting officer. Master subcontracting plans are useful forofferors who anticipate receiving many Government contracts requiring individualsubcontracting plans. <ITAG tagnum="80">519.702</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Statutory requirements. </ITAG>(a) The Small Business Act treats contracts and modifications separately,not cumulatively. Accordingly, if a subcontracting plan is not requiredat the time of award because the value of the contract is below the threshold,a  subcontracting plan will not be required if a subsequent modificationincreases the value of the contract to an amount which exceeds the threshold,unless the value of the modification itself exceeds $500,000 or $1 millionfor construction contracts. (b) It is not necessary to obtain another subcontracting plan for a modificationexceeding $500,000 ($1 million for construction contracts) if the contractalready includes a subcontracting plan. Modifications may be incorporatedinto an existing plan and, upon approval, the original plan goals revisedto include the new effort.<ITAG tagnum="80">519.704</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Subcontracting plan requirements. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Subcontracting goals.</T3> (1) Positive subcontracting goals for smalland small disadvantaged business concerns are required to establish a gaugefor measuring results, and to provide an incentive for continuing effortsto increase the dollar value of contracts placed with small and small disadvantagedbusiness concerns. (2) Although there may be no known small or small disadvantaged businessconcerns that furnish the products or services required by a prospectivecontractor at the time a subcontracting plan is developed, a zero goalis not acceptable because contractors are expected to make continuing effortsduring the contract period to locate and identify newly emerging smalland small disadvantaged business concerns as potential suppliers. In addition,there may be subcontracting opportunities in the area of indirect costs.(3) Goals in individual plans for multiyear contracts or contracts withoptions to extend the period of performance may be established for a periodless than the full term of the contract (including options) when it isimpractical to establish goals for the full term if the plan includes aschedule for establishing goals for the balance of the term of the contract.

(2) <T3>Commercial products plans.</T3> A commercial products plan is approvedby the first Federal agency awarding a contract for commercial productsduring the contractor's fiscal year, and is applicable to every additionalFederal contract for commercial products awarded to that contractor duringthe contractor's same fiscal year. If the approved plan is limited to adivision or plant, it only applies to additional contracts for commercialproducts of that particular division or plant. The cutoff date for applyinga previously approved commercial products plan to additional Federal contractsis the end of the company's fiscal year in which the plan was approved.If the contract extends beyond the contractor's fiscal year, the GSA contractingofficer responsible for monitoring the existing plan, under 519.706-70(c),must request a new plan 30 days prior to the end of the contractor's fiscalyear.<ITAG tagnum="80">519.705</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Responsibilities of the contracting officer under the subcontractingassistance program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">519.705-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Determining the need for a subcontracting plan.</ITAG>Before making a determination under FAR 19.705-2 that no subcontractingopportunities exist on a prospective contract, which meets the dollar threshold,the contracting officer must submit the determination to the SBTA for reviewand comments.

Alternatively,the contracting officer may deduct nothing or only a portion of the amountentered in Block 10 based upon the degree of completion of the contractson which the bonds were provided.  (b) If the contracting officer is unable to make a determination of networth from the SF 28, the individual surety must be required to furnishadditional information. Generally, supplementary information will not berequired unless the SF 28 is incomplete or improperly filled out or unlessthe contracting officer has reason to believe the surety's statement onthe SF 28 does not reflect the true net worth. (c) If the contracting officer determines that either surety's net worthis not equal to the penal amount of the bond, the bid of the firm utilizingthe sureties must be rejected as nonresponsible.

Any bid submitted in response toan invitation for bid which is accompanied by a bid guarantee backed byan individual surety who has been excluded must be rejected as nonresponsive.When a negotiated procurement is involved, such a deficiency may be remediedby the offeror in a revised proposal.
