It can be done legally and openly,and the Americans, I think, would approve of that,'' said the Rev.Lawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest who was held in Lebanonfrom January 1985 to June 1986.   Jenco, interviewed from Portland, Ore., on ABC-TV's ``GoodMorning America,'' said, ``I absolutely believe we should listen tothe Iranians ... We're talking about the assets of Iran and I'mtalking about the national assets of America which are nineAmericans who are there.''   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said on Tuesdaythat Iran would use its influence to try to free American hostagesin Lebanon if Washington releases assets frozen in the UnitedStates.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United Stateswill make no deals with Iran over release of the hostages. StateDepartment officials said they believe the assets referred to byRafsanjani are military equipment owned by Iran which PresidentCarter refused to release after the Islamic revolution toppled thelate Shah Reza Pahlavi in 1979 and 52 Americans were taken hostagefor 444 days.</TEXT></DOC>
