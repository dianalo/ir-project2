WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's governors concluded a harmoniousfour-day meeting today with a mildly worded resolution urging thegovernment to reduce the deficit and protect domestic spendingwithout raising taxes _ if possible.   During their annual meeting, the governors also skirted abortionand other policy differences and were summoned to a meeting oneducation next month with President Bush.   Democratic and Republican governors met separately overbreakfast to discuss their parties' prospects in the Virginia andNew Jersey governors races this year and the outlook for the 36governorships up in 1990.   Both groups met in private, with Democratic National ChairmanRon Brown addressing his party's governors. The Democrats electedOhio's Richard Celeste to be chairman of the Democratic Governors'Association, beginning in January.   Iowa Republican Terry Branstad was installed as new chairman ofthe bipartisan National Governors' Association, and Democrat BoothGardner of Washington was selected to serve as vice chairman tofollow Branstad as chairman in a year.   CBS anchorman Dan Rather spoke to the final full session of theNational Governors' Association conference, saying, ``You whoalready have the toughest job in American politics have got to takethe lead in convincing the president and Congress that the presentapproach to education policy is a mess and needs immediateoverhaul, and the present approach to the federal budget deficit isan Alice in Wonderland fantasy.''   Before heading home today, the governors approved a series ofpolicy statements, including a cautiously worded one urging thegovernment to reduce the deficit without raising taxes ``ifpossible,'' while protecting key domestic spending.   The governors also approved a resolution urging Congress and theBush administration to impose a two-year moratorium on expandedMedicaid coverage that the states would be required to pay for.   Other policy matters under consideration included allowingstudents and parents to select public schools of their choice``consistent with desegregation goals,'' and tougher steps againstdrug smuggling, including requiring cooperation in anti-drugefforts for countries to receive U.S. foreign aid.   Some of the governors headed home early, skipping the lastsession. One was Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, who said he needed todeal with forest fires that have become ``totally out of control.''   Bush, whose appearance at the conference was overshadowed Mondayby the reported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins bypro-Iranian captors in Lebanon, invited the governors to meet withhim in late September for a summit meeting on education. Themeeting, at a site to be named later, was a campaign promise ofBush and was discussed by governors last spring.   Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia, who was beingreplaced as chairman of the governors' association by RepublicanTerry Branstad of Iowa, said, ``We're impressed with theaccessibility and indications of a cooperative attitude'' from Bush.   Democrat Bill Clinton of Arkansas said the summit will keepeducation and child-related issues on the public agenda.   But Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat, said Bush's remarkswere too little considering Bush's campaign claim to be ``theeducation president.'' He called the speech ``uninspired anduninspiring.''   ``It lacked any real vision or any real voltage in terms ofgetting us moving now,'' said Celeste, in one of the few publiccriticisms of the administration voiced at the conference.   Celeste said the education meeting would discuss a dampeningeffect on state and local education initiatives created by thebudget climate and Bush's flat opposition to new taxes.   ``The president's posture last year in the election reallychilled efforts at education reform and education finance in manyparts of this country,'' Celeste said. ``The president is in aunique position to sound the trumpet _ and I didn't hear any brassthis morning.''   Governors of both parties met in private over breakfast beforeBush's remarks, and several governors said bipartisan concern wasvoiced over federal Medicaid requirements that force states tospend more on health care without compensation from the federalgovernment.   In a question-and-answer session with Bush, Celeste asked thepresident to consider a two-year moratorium on additional Medicaidrequirements, which he later described as the fastest growingspending item in his state budget.   Bush did not commit himself to such a moratorium but said, ``I'dlike to consider it, and certainly we're trying to hold the line onspiraling costs.''   Bush and his Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner suggestedthey were sympathetic with the governors' request that surplusfederal transportation trust funds be released, but made nopromises of money. The trust funds for highways and airportfacilities contain up to $19 billion, according to governors, whocontend much of that is being withheld from the states so it cancount against the deficit in the federal budget.   ``It is important that we begin to spend the balances of thetrust fund as soon as possible on mass transit, highways andaviation infrastructure,'' Skinner said.   Scientist Carl Sagan urged the governors to support steps tocounter the environmental threats of ozone depletion and globalwarming, including a ban on chlorofluorocarbons and increased useof alternative fuels. Chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals found insuch products as coolants, cleaning solvents and plastic foodcontainers.   ``It is a problem that's extremely serious and will not besolved by business as usual,'' said Sagan.</TEXT></DOC>
