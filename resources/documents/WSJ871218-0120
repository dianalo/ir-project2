The Danbury, Conn.-based chemical concern disputed Judge M.W. Deo's order, saying it amounts to awarding damages without trial, a practice that runs counter to the laws of India and other democracies. &quot;We have voluntarily offered millions of dollars in humanitarian aid for the victims, but have been repeatedly rebuffed,&quot; a spokesman said.    But the Indian government's attorney, Vepa Sarthy, described Thursday's decision as &quot;an excellent judgment.&quot;    More than 2,800 people were killed and as many as 40,000 were injured when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a Carbide pesticide plant Dec. 3, 1984. Judge Deo ordered that 3.5 billion rupees be deposited with the Bhopal court within two months.    He said the money would be placed at the disposal of the commissioner of claims, appointed by the government following the disaster. Although the details will be left to the commissioner, Judge Deo suggested that compensation to relatives of those killed could be about 200,000 rupees ($15,468) per death. For injuries, he suggested about 100,000 rupees for those totally disabled and unspecified lesser amounts for other injuries.    He said his order shall &quot;naturally be without prejudice to the rights and defenses of the parties to the court and the counterclaim that may finally be adjudicated.&quot; He'd earlier extended three deadlines to allow Union Carbide and the Indian government to decide on an out-of-court settlement as compensation for the Bhopal victims.    Victims of the gas disaster gathered in crowds in front of the Bhopal courthouse Thursday in anticipation of a decision. Reactions to the judgment were mixed. &quot;It is the first victory of the gas victims,&quot; said Alok Pratap Singh, a representative of the Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front, a voluntary organization in Bhopal. &quot;But the amount is not sufficient. We had demanded 10 billion rupees.&quot;    The government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi could face criticism of any settlement that falls short of the $3 billion it has claimed in court. Private parties also have filed 523,770 claims against Union Carbide in the Bhopal court.    Lawyers in New Delhi said Union Carbide may appeal Thursday's order for interim relief. Last month, Union Carbide said the government had agreed to a schedule for paying $496.2 million in 10 payments spread over 10 years, plus a framework for agreement that identifies four areas of compensation and the number of victims deserving compensation. India's attorney general denied that any settlement had taken place.    In Connecticut, Union Carbide spokesman Robert Berzok said, &quot;We wish to bring legal proceedings to a conclusion and to see that prompt aid comes to the victims. Both results will be achieved by a settlement between Union Carbide and the government of India. Neither result would be achieved by an order for interim compensation, which is likely to only prolong litigation.&quot;    Union Carbide contends that the Bhopal disaster was caused by sabotage by a disgruntled employee.    The 1984 disaster was the world's worst industrial accident. On Sept. 5, 1986, the Indian government filed suit on behalf of the victims, accusing Union Carbide of negligence. On Dec. 1 of this year, India filed criminal charges, accusing Union Carbide, several subsidiaries and several officials of homicide. </TEXT></DOC>
