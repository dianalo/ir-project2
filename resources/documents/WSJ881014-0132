MCorp has offered to combine its $400 million, which is in stock and cash, with assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to recapitalize the 25 banks under its own management. But the FDIC wants MCorp to inject the money into its banks now, and isn't making any promises to protect the holding company from losing it.    The dispute, disclosed by the American Banker newspaper, pits MCorp's shareholders and debtholders against the regulatory agencies. The struggle could delay an FDIC decision on MCorp's request for financial aid. And its outcome could decide whether current managers and directors will control MCorp in the future.    At issue is a basic conflict between bank regulatory doctrine and bank directors' fiduciary interests. The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC contend that bank holding companies are obliged to use their resources to help their subsidiary banks survive setbacks. At the same time, the regulators' policy in recent years has been to rescue only banks, leaving their holding company creditors and shareholders with little or nothing when banks fail.    Federal deposit insurance extends only to the banks. &quot;That's where {regulators} risk is,&quot; said Ronald Glancz, a former FDIC lawyer. The regulators, he added, don't care about protecting holding companies.    But MCorp directors may fear lawsuits by shareholders and debtholders if they put the holding company's cash into its banks, exposing it to the risk of loss. Some MCorp debtholders are said to have already warned the holding company's directors against injecting the cash.    &quot;The question really becomes whether Federal Reserve Board policy reaches the level of a legal-type obligation that overrides the responsibilities of directors to shareholders and debtholders,&quot; said Rodgin Cohen, a New York banking attorney.    The Fed has taken action only once in recent years to enforce its policy that holding companies serve as a &quot;source of strength&quot; for its banks. But that case became moot and was dropped after the bank had failed, leaving the policy's legal status unclear.    MCorp directors and managers also appear to be using the $400 million, which they amassed over the past two years by selling the company's MNet Corp. and MTech Corp. subsidiaries, as a bargaining chip in their effort to retain control of their banking empire.    Other banks are understood to have told the FDIC they are interested in acquiring the MCorp banks. But it would be difficult for the agency to transfer the banks to them while the $400 million was in the holding company.    The FDIC proposed legislation this year seeking authority to force a holding company to consolidate its bank subsidiaries when one might fail and another might prosper. But that wouldn't help the failing bank if the strength lies in its holding company.    Banking lawyers expect a compromise in the matter, with the agency offering something to the holding company in return for injecting the cash into the banks. Both sides face pressure to resolve the dispute, because delay causes deterioration in the banks.    An MCorp spokesman declined to comment, except to say, &quot;A proposal has been presented to the FDIC and obviously there is a period of negotiation and discussion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
