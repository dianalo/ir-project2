Raymond P. Berube, deputy assistant secretary for environment,said a firm estimate for cleanup costs was not yet possible becausethe department is uncertain how badly the environment has beendamaged at many of the weapons plants.   ``There's a strong chance that these costs will go higher'' than$63 billion, he said, adding that projected costs are likely toescalate as more detailed information is learned about the extent ofthe soil and groundwater contamination.   ``There's a lot of uncertainty at this point,'' he told a HouseArmed Services subcommittee.   Berube said that while contamination at some sites could becleaned up in two or three years, work at the most polluted plants``will require decades to complete.''   He cited the Pinellas Plant, near Largo, Fla., which makeselectronic components for nuclear weapons, as a likely candidate forspeedy cleanup, in part because the vinyl chloride contaminationthere is less far flung and is not radioactive.   Among the most difficult cleanup jobs will be at the HanfordReservation, near Richland, Wash., which Berube said is the mostpolluted site in the entire complex, and the Savannah River Plant,near Aiken, S.C., which produces a highly radioactive gas. There hasbeen extensive contamination of soil and groundwater at these sites,dating back to the early years of operation in the 1950s.   Key elements of the weapons complex, including parts of SavannahRiver, Hanford and the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant inColorado, have been closed down by the Energy Department in recentmonths because of safety and technical problems.   An Energy Department report issued last month said it would cost$52 billion to modernize the weapons complex, and another $29billion to clean it up, over the next 21 years. The department hassaid the cleanup cost eventually would range up to $63 billion, plusanother $2 billion to $4 billion for decommissioning anddecontaminating parts of the complex that are permanently shut down.   An official of the General Accounting Office, the investigatingarm of Congress, reiterated the GAO's position that some of theweapons plants are so badly polluted that they may never be cleanedup. He did not specify these plants.   ``In the final analysis, some areas within the complex may beirreversibly contaminated,'' J. Dexter Peach, GAO's assistantcomptroller general, told the House panel. As a result, he said,these sites may simply be sealed off and never used again.   Rep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo., said sealing off sites wouldamount to creating ``national sacrifice zones,'' which he called``utterly unacceptable.''   Skaggs, whose district includes the Rocky Flats weapons plant,called on the Energy Department to ``speed up dramatically'' itsefforts to identify all the contamination problems and to clean themup.   ``Our national defense and the future of the nuclear weaponscomplex itself will be very much at risk if that full cleanup is notundertaken,'' he said.   Peach also criticized the Energy Department for having failed todevelop a comprehensive plan for cleaning up the nuclear wastedespite having been urged by the GAO to do so three years ago.   ``Recent DOE plans and reports have shed considerable light onthe problems DOE faces; however, none of them taken individually orcollectively provide an overall comprehensive environmentalstrategy,'' Peach said.   Berube told the hearing that President Bush's designated energysecretary, James D. Watkins, was intent on moving quickly to developa five-year action plan, based on currently available information,for cleaning up and modernizing the weapons complex.</TEXT></DOC>
