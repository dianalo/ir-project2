Medical and scientific researchers defendedtheir work as life-saving.   The last week in April traditionally has been a week of activismby groups that oppose use of animals in research experiments, and``civil disobedience is definitely on the ticket across thecountry'' this week, said Ingrid Newkirk, national director ofPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.   The groups, who have billed this as ``World Laboratory AnimalLiberation Week, are calling on the federal government anduniversities to stop animal experiments and use research moneyinstead on other medical needs, including developing preventivemedicine strategies.   ``At a time when there are so many human needs, to be playingaround with animals in the basements of universities seems not onlycruel to the animals, but wasteful of dollars,'' Newkirk said.   She estimated the federal government spends as much as $6billion a year on research using animals and said the results ofthis research could be derived in ways that don't harm or killanimals.   Animal research advocates said other methods, such as computermodels, can supplement animal experimentation but will not replaceit any time soon.   In defense of animal research, advocates say that mostexperiments are not painful and that about 90 percent of theanimals used in such research are rodents bred specifically for labexperimentation.   Monday's protests focused on the National Institutes of Healthin the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Md. Protesters said NIH isthe world's largest source of financing for animal experimentation.   Police arrested 50 or so of the 200 demonstrators after theyblocked traffic for about 30 minutes. Officers dragged many acrossthe road. Ginger Redmon, who said she had been arrested in twoother animal rights protests, said the civil disobedience ``showswe have a strong commitment.''   Although their ultimate goal is to stop all researchexperimentation on animals, animal rights activists say that forthe immediate future they are seeking an end to the most blatantcruelties, such as amputation of an animal's toe for the purpose ofidentification.   To defend their research, medical and scientific experimentersare using this week as an opportunity to speak out in support ofthe use of animals in medical research, pointing to the medicalbreakthroughs such research has brought _ from coronary bypasssurgery to cataract removal, from vaccines to antibiotics.   ``There's no such thing as anybody not having received somebenefit from animal research,'' said Frankie Trull, president ofthe Foundation for Biomedical Research, a nonprofit group thatsupports animal research.   In a letter to President Bush and members of Congress, Dr. DavidH. Hubel, president of the Society for Neuroscience, called forresearchers to ``make our case heard by the mass of sensible peoplein this country.''   Hubel said that while he and his fellow researchers ``stronglycondemn any unnecessary suffering of experimental animals,''research on monkeys, cats and other animals in labs has producedmany medical advances that have cured diseases and saved lives.   ``With tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria and a host of otherdiseases largely solved, can we risk losing the opportunity todiscover cures for heart disease, cancer and AIDS?'' Hubel asked inthe letter.   Dr. Louis Sullivan, the secretary of the health and humanservices, said in a speech last week that he would ``do everythingpossible'' to ensure the humane treatment of animals in the lab.   ``But I will not let the integrity of our public health researchefforts be compromised by well organized efforts'' run by animalrights activists, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
