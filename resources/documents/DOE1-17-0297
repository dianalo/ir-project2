The test specimen is an arc cut from the pipe and exposedto fatigue loading. Fractographic analysis reveals that the crack propagatesby a dominantly brittle mechanism which becomes progressively more ductileuntil ultimate failure by tearing. Employing the crack layer theory,the specific enthalpy of brittle fracture was found to be about 800KJ/cum. This quantity is a candidate parameter for characterizing the material'sresistance to brittle crack propagation.</TEXT></DOC>
