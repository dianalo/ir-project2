Michel Aoun rejected a truce in hisChristian army's fight with Druse militiamen and Syrian soldiers,and declared Friday he will settle for nothing less than Syrianwithdrawal from Lebanon.   The 17-day-old artillery and rocket battle, in which Syriantroops joined the Druse this week, resumed in the afternoon after a14-hour lull.   Hundreds of rounds fell on both sides of the line that dividesBeirut between Christians and Moslems, and on Druse and Christiantowns in the mountains overlooking the capital, police said.   Rocket volleys and popping flares lighted the night sky andrumbling explosions shook the city.   Police had no immediate report on casualties, but have given thetotal in previous action as 81 people killed and 253 wounded, mostof them civilians.   It is the worst fighting since 1985 in Lebanon's 14-year-oldcivil war and magnifies a political crisis that arose last fall,creating sectarian army commands and competing Christian and Moslemgovernments.   Aoun said he would continue the battle even if Beirut isdemolished.   ``This city has been wiped out by seven or eight earthquakes inancient history,'' he said. ``We will build a ninth Beirut if it isdestroyed in this confrontation.''   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the United States was withdrawinga military ``technical assistance team at the Defense Ministry aspart of the embassy's policy of reducing American personnel due tothe current situation.''   He said one member of the three-man team already was abroad onvacation. The Americans came to Lebanon in 1983 to train armypersonnel in the use of U.S.-made equipment.   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement saying``everyone with influence ought to act in a responsible manner andexercise restraint.'' It did not name Syria, but officials said theU.S. Embassy in Damascus had spoken with Syrian authorities aboutthe need for a cease-fire.   Aoun told a news conference the Americans were being pulled outshortly before the end of their term and ``their withdrawal willnot have any effect on the army.''   He leads the interim Christian government in addition tocommanding the 20,000 Christians in the Lebanese army, who are muchbetter equipped than the 22,000 Moslems led by Maj. Gen. SamiKhatib.   Khatib's men have helped blockade the 310-square-mile Christianenclave north and east of Beirut but appear to have stayed out ofthe fighting, which began two days after Aoun blockaded illegalports operated by Moslem militias.   The Christian commander held a news conference at thepresidential palace in suburban Baabda after meeting with Kuwait'sambassador to Syria, Ahmed Jassem, who told reporters theydiscussed ``a cease-fire and a solution to the presentconfrontation.''   Jassem saw Aoun again after a session in Moslem west Beirut withSalim Hoss, the Sunni Moslem premier of the Syrian-backed Moslemgovernment, then returned to Syria without comment.   Aoun said his confrontation with the Syrians and WalidJumblatt's Druse militia was ``a nationalist march to liberateLebanon.''   ``It is the responsibility of the whole people,'' he said. ``Thelife of the Lebanese should no more be in the hands of a Syriansoldier who can pull the trigger any minute.''   Syria is ``a terrorist country,'' he said, and ``we can't figureout how a terrorist country can have a peacekeeping role.''   Neighboring Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League and Hafez Assad, theSyrian president, has become this country's main power broker inthe chaos of civil war.   Aoun said he is pursuing a ``nationalist cause, not a Christiancause'' in fighting the Syrians and their allies.   ``The Syrians are slaughtering us,'' he said of Lebanon. ``Theyare trying to eliminate our country ... reduce it to ashes.''   Asked whether the current violence would would block efforts byan Arab League mediation committee to settle the crisis, hereplied: ``It shouldn't.''   Jassem was sent to Beirut Thursday by the six-man Arab Leaguecommittee, which Arab foreign ministers formed at an emergencymeeting in January. Sheik Sabah Ahmad Sabah, Kuwait's foreignminister, is the chairman.   The crisis was born when President Amin Gemayel's six-year termended Sept. 22 and Parliament could not agree on a successor.   Gemayel named Aoun to lead an interim government but Moslems,with Syria's support, swore allegiance to Hoss, who had beenpremier under Gemayel. The army commands split as a result of thesectarian division in government.   An unwritten covenant dating to independence from France in 1943requires the president to be a Christian, the premier a SunniMoslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.</TEXT></DOC>
