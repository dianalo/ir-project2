Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for exportadministration, said the change will obviate 20,000 exportlicenses a year and help speed up deliveries of $30 billionin annual shipments to America's best high-tech customers.&quot;This means giving U.S. businesses an even better chance tocompete in the international marketplace,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   The new rule will free exports of most computers,semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, precision instruments,telecommunications equipment and other high-technologyproducts from licensing requirements.   The department said it will maintain existing licensingrequirements for shipments of some critical items, such assupercomputers, X-ray lithography systems, certain underwatersensing equipment and cryptographic devices. The new rule,nonetheless, brings the U.S. and the 16 affected alliedcountries a step closer to creating what their authoritiescall a &quot;license-free zone&quot; within their borders. All thecountries belong to the Coordinating Committee forMultilateral Export Controls, which oversees joint efforts tokeep sensitive technology out of the hands of potentialadversaries.   The relaxation in licensing requirements is designed toeliminate a disadvantage U.S. exporters face in trade withinCocom; currently, they have to plow through more paper workthan their competitors in Japan or Western Europe.   The rule doesn't eliminate all paper work; exporters stillwill be required to maintain some records in case authoritiesdecide they need it. But the department said it might endeven the remaining restrictions within a year if all theCocom members agree to raise their standards for enforcingexport controls to a common level. Mr. Kloske said Cocom hasset an April 30, 1991, deadline for completing this task.   The Commerce Department action comes on the heels ofCocom's decision earlier this month to release previouslycontrolled Western technology to the Soviet Union and EasternEurope. Despite that relaxation, the U.S. is trying to getthe other Cocom members to agree to uniform licensingrequirements for shipping the most strategically sensitivegoods among Cocom members. The Commerce Department commendedJapan, Canada, Norway and Australia for agreeing to followthe U.S. lead.   The U.S. still requires licenses for shipments of certainitems even to Cocom destinations because they are consideredhigh-risk targets for illegal acquisition by the Soviet Unionor by Third World countries with clandestine programs tobuild nuclear devices or ballistic missiles. Moreover, thedepartment said it will maintain existing controls onshipments of chemical and biological weapons. Also unchangedis the current U.S. practice of requiring buyers in otherCocom countries to apply for re-export licenses beforeshipping licensed U.S. products to other countries.</TEXT></DOC>
