It was establishedthat carbon content should be decresed down to 0.05% when melting steelfrom high-pure charge. The decrease of electrochemical heterogeneityof grain boundaries and therefor high degree of passivation in agressivemedia can be achieved when melting Kh18N12T steel from standard chargeat elevated strength, usinghot working of bars at 900 deg.C with reductionof 60% per one pasing.</TEXT></DOC>
