The analysis was performed with boundary conditionscorresponding to a normal transport condition and a hypothetical accidentcondition. Computational results indicated that the insulation materialin the 6M containers will adequately protect the payload region of the6M containers. 26 refs., 26 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
