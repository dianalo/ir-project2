Lattisnet, runningover fiber optic and unshielded twisted pair cable.andP;  The fiber choice wasbased on the impracticality of running copper cable between buildings.andP;  St.andO;Joseph's is built on a bed of sheer rock, and, says Berberian, every rainyseason the lightning strikes rattle through the rock and damage the copperwire.andP;  Fiber, the miracle media, is immune to such disturbances.andM;Ethernet was a natural choice for less extraordinary reasons.andP;  The computingenvironment at St. Joseph's consists of three types of systems: themulti-user Unix systems common to most universities, IBM Pcs and compatibles,and Macintoshes.andP;  A smattering of Apple IIe's are quickly being phased out.andO;If you look at they ways you can interconnect those platforms, TCP/IP is thebest protocol,&quot; says Petragnani.andP;  &quot;Once we decided on TCP/IP, Ethernetfollowed naturally.andP;  The software decision really drove the Physical layerdecision.&quot; The choice also stemmed from St. Joseph's commitment to standards.andO;&quot;Proprietary is a bad word as far as we're concerned,&quot; says Berberian.andM;Even before the plan to network the entire university was approved, otherbuildings were drawn into the integration process.andP;  The library,specifically, since the fiber that connects the Science Center to BarbelinHall had to be run through a conduit that passed through the basement of thelibrary.andP;  Originally the library was connected to Barbelin with thetroublesome copper wire.andP;  Since the fiber had to be passed under the libraryanyway, a few strands were terminated there to eliminate the copper problem.andO;System is A HitandM;Although the network wound up costing  $30,000,  instead  of the $18,000originally estimated, the university clearly considers it well worth theprice.andP;  Once the capabilities of the network were demonstrated to the boardof trustees and the president, the university allocated one million dollarsfor networking in May of 1988.andP;  Although designing and implementing thecampus-wide network was a personal endeavor on the part of Berberian andPetragnani and their staff, they both credit the university's president,Father Nicholas Rashford, with having the vision to support the project.andM;At the time the money was allocated for networking, a new student dormitory,McShain Hall, was under construction.andP;  Rashford referred to the new facilityas a &quot;living, learning center.&quot; As such it includes not only student rooms,but classrooms and study areas as well.andP;  There's also an executive center onthe top floor that has several seminar and conference rooms that theuniversity makes available to corporations.andM;Technical sophistication was also built into McShain, to involve students inthe network.andP;  There are two twisted pair outlets in each dorm room.andP;  Thenetwork is designed so that from any outlet a student can access Ethernet,Appletalk or even a RS-232 port.andP;  That flexibility was essential, sincedifferent students, and therefore potentially different equipment, would behoused each year.andP;  The university provides a network interface card andnetwork software, free of charge for now, to any student who requests it.andP;  Ofthe 288 students currently living in McShain, 40 of them have PCs or Macsconnected to the network.andM;The network designers chose Sun's Network File System (NFS) as the filesharing protocol for the same reason they chose Ethernet and TCP/IP, becauseit was so prevalent on so many hardware platforms.andP;  NFS works so well thatthis past fall when an old VAX machine running Berkeley UNIX, which was theirmain system, was replaced with a Sun workstation running SunOs, the usersrequired no retraining.andP;  &quot;The interface was consistent,&quot; says Petragnani.andO;&quot;We feel strongly about maintaining that kind of vendor independence.&quot;andO;intricate CablingandM;Cabling the network was slightly more complicated than choosing the topology,because of the number of buildings involved and the geographic locations ofthe campus.andP;  The campus sprawls across the city line separating Philadelphiaand Lower Merion, and buildings on both sides of campus have to beinterconnected.andP;  Altogether ten buildings on either side of the campus haveto be connected.andP;  That number doesn't include the Overbrook Building, aformer hospital five blocks away that presently houses students and isconnected to the rest of the campus with a 56Kbps phone line.andM;A 72-strand fiber cable connects Barbelin to McShain, and actually runsacross a bridge that spans the road dividing the campus.andM;From McShain, four cables of 12 strands each run to four administrativebuildings on the Merion side of the campus.andP;  The fiber runs into McShain'slocal concentrator, and twisted pair runs out to a Sun 3/150 server, the dormrooms Pcs, and an Appletalk/Ethernet gateway.andP;  The Appletalk/Ethernet gatewayis connected to an Appletalk concentrator and services a Mac II server, aswell as whatever Macs and IIe's are in the students rooms.andM;The four administrative buildings, Claver, St. Mary's, St. Thomas and Regisalso have RS-232 connections that run from the buildings to fibermultiplexers to the McDonnell-Douglas 9240 residing in the main computerfacility in Barbelin.andP;  RS-232 connections also hook the financial aidterminals to the McDonnell-Douglas mini.andP;  There are also library terminalsconnected to the Geac 8000-a popular library system-by RS-232 cables runningthrough the fiber muxes.andM;On the Philadelphia side, a 12strand fiber cable runs from Barbelin to theScience Center.andP;  (See Figure 3.) Three 12-strand cables also run todistribution points throughout the building.andP;  Finally a 72-strand cable runsto Bellarmine, and a 12-strand cable runs from Bellarmine to Villiger.andO;Bellarmine and Villiger are both business school buildings.andP;  Bellarmine willbe renovated and fully networked this summer.andP;  More on the Villiger networklater.andM;The configuration in Barbelin is similar to the one in McShain.andP;  There is aSun 4/390 server connected to the local concentrator.andP;  The concentrator alsoconnects the lab and faculty office PCs and the Appletalk/Ethernet gatewaywhich in turn provides Mac and IIe connectivity.andP;  There is also an Ethernetterminal server and a coax repeater hooked up to the Barbelin concentrator.andO;The Science center also provides a similar set up, with an ATandamp;T 3B2/400server, faculty office PC connections and Mac connections through anAppletalk/Ethernet gateway.andM;Integrating Existing NetsandM;Remember that several departmental networks were in place before the mainnetworking effort got underway.andP;  The small Token Ring in the president'soffice is currently being interconnected with Win/Route from the WollongongGroup.andP;  Although WIN/Route has proven adequate, it doesn't provide the fullcomplement of NFS services.andP;  Villiger, one of the business school buildings,has a Netware LAN on Arcnet and G/Net hardware to provide a classroom forcomputerized instruction.andP;  This Netware LAN has been in place since 1986,long before the networking project was begun andandM;e standards established, This summer, a Novell TCP/IP gateway will beinstalled to connect the Villiger network users, and some users will receivedirect Ethernet connections.andM;The thin-wire Ethernet in the Math department will probably be eliminatedentirely, although the problem is not so much the equipment as curious userswho have taken to unplugging the T-connectors in the back of their computer,thereby knocking out portions of the daisy-chained network.andP;  &quot;From amanagement perspective, the concentrator/wiring closet design is moreappropriate for our users,&quot; says Petragnani.andP;  Although there are eventualplans to integrate all these networks fully, Berberian would like to see therest of the campus networked first.andP;  &quot;We want to take care of the have-notsbefore we worry about the have-somes,&quot; he says.andM;Planning the FutureandM;Although the entire network isn't fully installed yet, Berberian andPetragnani are already planning for the future.andP;  All the fiber that's beenpulled is FDDI-compliant in case the university should ever want to takeadvantage of that technology, although they see no need in the immediatefuture.andP;  Also, they want to explore the network management capability of theSynoptics equipment.andP;  That hasn't happened so far partially because offinancial restraints and partially because the network planners are waitingto see what SynOptics' position is in regard to network management standardssuch as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or CMIS over TCP/IP(CMIP).andP;  Eventual plans also include integrating voice, data and video overthe fiber.andM;Despite some initial skepticism at Berberian and Petragnani designing andimplementing the network themselves, user response has been enthusiastic.andO;They have a consistent interface across all hardware platforms andflexibility when choosing their equipment.andP;  &quot;Three to four years ago we knewnothing about networking,&quot; says Petragnani.andP;  &quot;We implemented it all fromscratch and by showing users a new way of doing things, we've created ademand for networking.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
