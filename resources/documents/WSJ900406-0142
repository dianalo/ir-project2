Mr. Li repeatedly retreated to blandness or non-answerswhen treading on controversial ground as he fielded questionsfrom foreign and Chinese reporters after the annual NationalPeople's Congress. Chinese viewing the broadcast got anearful nevertheless as the international media put thepremier on the spot, asking the questions most citizens herewouldn't dare utter.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;One assumes that China's leaders won't give satisfactoryanswers,&quot; says Andrew Higgins, Beijing correspondent for theIndependent, a British daily. &quot;So what matters is simplyasking tough questions.&quot;   It's a role that foreign journalists took on here aftermost Chinese were cowed into silence by the violentsuppression of last year's pro-democracy movement. By raisingtough questions as they do in the West, foreign journalistsoften disclose to the Chinese masses controversial facts thatChina's state-controlled media studiously avoid.   For example, a Hong Kong reporter asked Mr. Li's reactionto news that a leader of last year's student demonstrationshad escaped to the West. Mr. Li shrugged off the question,but it was the first time Chinese around the country watchingthe broadcast had heard that one of the country's most-wanted&quot;criminals&quot; had evaded China's security apparatus and escapedoverseas.   The Chinese also learn of taboo topics from theChinese-language broadcasts of Voice of America and the BBC.But since June, the authorities frequently have jammed thebroadcasts. But almost everyone has access to a television,and they tune in faithfully when the leaders meet the press.   Given the embarrassing leaks, why doesn't the governmentban foreign journalists from the televised conferences? AChinese intellectual explains that, despite the unwelcomequestioning, the presence of foreign journalists lends an airof credibility and legitimacy to the proceedings, and helpsreinforce the idea that China is an open society.   &quot;It's an uncomfortable trade-off,&quot; says the scholar. &quot;Butit gives the Chinese leaders enormous `face' to have theWestern media eagerly participating in their politicaltheatrics.&quot;   On Wednesday, foreign journalists threw a number of toughquestions to the premier. Among them: Does Mr. Li have anyregrets for last year's killings? (No.) Will China's leaderskeep Tiananmen Square open to the public, despite fears ofrenewed protests? (Unclear.) Will ousted Communist Partychief Zhao Ziyang ever make a political comeback? (Unlikely.)   Mr. Li dodged specifics. When asked which leader gave theorder to open fire on demonstrators in Beijing last June 3-4,he ducked the question, saying only, &quot;There was no otherchoice but to use force to stop the turmoil.&quot; When anotherWestern journalist repeated the question, Mr. Li dismissed itwith obvious pique, saying, &quot;I've already answered that.&quot;   Despite the evasions, many Chinese eagerly watched thebroadcast. &quot;The Chinese people's spirits have been very lowrecently,&quot; said a government worker after the telecast. &quot;Buthearing journalists ask so many sensitive questions certainlystirs up a lot of people.&quot;   Indeed, foreign reporters frequently meet Chinese whorecognize them from televised news conferences. Many praisethe journalists for raising controversial questions. But suchattention puts journalists in an ethically awkward position:their goal is to report the news objectively, not be drawninto the Chinese political debate.   By contrast, journalists for China's tightly controlledpress pose only the softest of questions. Some appearedprearranged to let Mr. Li make points. Others weresuper-cautious.   In one, a People's Liberation Daily reporter waxedemotional about the military's constitutional duty tosuppress unrest such as the Tiananmen protests. When hefinished his impassioned question, Mr. Li was speechless fora time.   &quot;You have made a correct and comprehensive analysis of theconstitution,&quot; said Mr. Li, a hard-liner who is thought tohave played a leading role in the suppression of theprotests. &quot;I have nothing to add.&quot;   To his credit, Mr. Li did solicit questions from manyWestern reporters. And, while offering little newinformation, he handled the questions with confidence.   When foreign journalists asked questions about the Junekillings -- still the central issue to many Chinese -- Mr. Lidismissed them as irrelevant:   &quot;It's nearly a year after the June 4 events,&quot; he said. &quot;Iwonder if this question isn't a little outdated.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
