If the X-ray contrastproduced by iodine can be enhanced sufficiently relative to that producedby the intervening body tissues, it becomes possible to obtain imagesof arteries by introducing the contrast agent into the venous circulationrather than through an arterial catheter directly into the vessel underexamination. An imaging system that shows promise of accomplishing thisgoal for examination of the coronary arteries has been developed foroperation in an X-ray beam at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory.Iodine-selective contrast enhancement is achieved by logarithmic subtractionof two images of the same field. One of these images is formed by monochromaticX-rays of energy just above the characteristic iodine K-absorption edgeat 33.17 keV, the other by X-rays of energy just below the edge. Thecomputer-controlled imaging system acquires digitized images line byline while scanning the subject through a stationary X-ray beam of linearprofile. At present, only synchrotron radiation can provide monochromaticX-ray beams of intensity sufficient to image the small and rapidly movingcoronary arteries.</TEXT></DOC>
