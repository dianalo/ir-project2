The price cuts will take effect on July 1, the same time theFederal Communications Commission's new price-cap plan begins.   Under the price-cap plan adopted March 16, the FCC limits theprices ATandamp;T charges rather than the profits it makes.   The new cuts will bring rates for consumers and small businessesdown to the maximum permitted by the new regulation, ATandamp;T spokesmanBryant Steele said.   ATandamp;T's prices for large businesses had already been broughtbelow the price cap.   The latest decrease will bring ATandamp;T's total interstatelong-distance price reductions to almost 40 percent in the fiveyears since the Bell System breakup, the company said.   MCI Communications Corp. spokeswoman Pam Small said the mandatedcut was not a surprise. ``It's a small number, probably smallerthan we would have expected,'' she said.   US Sprint Communications Co. spokesman Syd Courson said thecompany would have no comment until its analysts had scanned theprice filing.   Under the filing:   _Prices on general long-distance service will drop about $60million a year.   _The Reach Out America discount calling plan for consumers willbe expanded at no extra charge. Prices of the basic and eveningbonus versions of Reach Out America will be cut.   _The international Reach Out calling plan will be expanded fromfour to 25 countries.   _ATandamp;T will cut prices on calls its customers make between Mexicoand the United States and on calls from the United States to thePhilippines, Denmark, the Faeroe Islands in the North Atlantic,Finland, Norway and Sweden. ATandamp;T also will cut prices oninternational calls from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   _When holidays occur during the weekend but are legally observedon a weekday, ATandamp;T will apply its holiday prices on the weekday theholiday is observed.</TEXT></DOC>
