But the proposed remedies are largely technical, some arecontradictory, few have been implemented, none has been writteninto law and chances seem increasingly remote that any will be inthe foreseeable future.   Moreover, critics contend, most studies have failed to confrontimportant underlying problems and weaknesses in the nation'ssecurities markets, such as why stocks shot up so far in the firstplace before crashing.   These critics say the recommendations made to date appeardesigned mainly to protect powerful interests that control theindustry, such as the specialists who make markets for stocks onthe New York Stock Exchange, and the floor traders on the Chicagofutures and options exchanges.   Some say key issues, such as speculative abuses, the function ofmarket makers and Wall Street's changing role in the economy,remain unresolved or ignored.   ``The financial events of October 1987 will probably beremembered by our descendants as vividly as we remember the eventsof October 1929,'' Junius W. Peake, a capital-markets consultantand expert who has studied the crash, wrote in a recent edition ofInvestment Management Review.   ``What will ultimately matter most, however, is whether theforensic economists and writers who issue the final autopsy reportwill make a correct diagnosis of the near cause of death of theU.S. equity market.''   So far, the Black Monday inquests have caused little more thandisputes and bickering. Even the Reagan administration couldn'tagree on the conclusions of its own crash study headed bynow-Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, and convened a second panelthat largely refuted the Brady group's recommendations. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures TradingCommission, which regulate market practices, couldn't agree on whoshould supervise stock-index futures, an exotic product that somestudies linked to the wild price swings during the crash.   The Federal Reserve, which Brady's group had suggested as thesuper-regulator of all markets, appears highly unwilling to assumethat role.   The New York Stock Exchange, a powerful bastion of marketmakers, concluded that speculative selling in the Chicago futurespits played a crucial role in the rout.   No, the Chicago exchanges retorted, it was panic selling in NewYork that started the crash, plus the failure or unwillingness ofthe NYSE specialists to handle the flood of sell orders.   Meanwhile, an emotional debate has raged about the role ofcomputerized program trading strategies that exploit pricedifferences between stocks and stock-index futures, sometimescausing sudden price jolts.   Critics say these techniques intensified the crash and havecontinued to unnerve investors; defenders say they are just ascapegoat and actually help stabilize the markets by keeping stocksand futures prices from diverging.   Despite the quarreling and delays in post-crash reforms, somesignificant progress has been made as a result of the studies,leading figures in the securities industry contend.   ``All the studies have at least led to a de facto improvement,some coordination among markets,'' said William Schreyer, chairmanof Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. ``The fact they're all talking to eachother, working together, has been an encouraging step.''   For example in July, the NYSE and Chicago Mercantile Exchangeproposed a plan for jointly managed ``circuit breakers'' _ tradinghalts and price limits to discourage volatility and panic selling.The NYSE also proposed altering its computer system to allow smallinvestors speedier access to the market.   Since February, the NYSE has enforced a so-called ``collar''that limits computerized trading when the Dow Jones industrialaverage swings 50 points from the previous session's close.   The circuit breakers, now being reviewed by federal regulators,are expected to supercede the collar after it expires on Oct. 19,the crash anniversary.   In the over-the-counter market, the National Association ofSecurities Dealers has tightened rules on its market makers, whobuy and sell stocks via a nationwide computerized network. Inaddition, the NASD has said it will enable investors to find out iftheir brokers have ever been in trouble.   ``Basically, it seems to me that the studies were theappropriate response as opposed to rushing in with a lot ofill-advised regulation,'' said John Damgard, president of theFutures Industry Association in Washington.   ``I think this administration has done the proper thing,''Damgard said. ``They are not anxious to change any of the basicauthorities. That doesn't mean they don't see the need forimprovement.''   Nevertheless, others say, long-term risks to the markets wouldpersist even with the solutions advanced so far. Opponents oftrading halts and price limits, for example, contend these arecosmetic measures that could hasten a market panic.   ``I think these collars and caps and circuit breakers and allthat, are just devices which reduce the liquidity of the market,''said Morris Mendelson, a finance professor at the University ofPennsylvania's Wharton School. ``I'm afraid that in a pinch, theywouldn't work.''   Nevertheless, he said, the studies have at least helped heightenconcern about the stock crash and whether it could happen again.   ``Discussion is always useful. The more discussion the better,''he said. ``One of the things I worry about is when we stop talkingabout it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Oct. 2</NOTE></DOC>
