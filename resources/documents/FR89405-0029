TheFMP was developed by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council)under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act(Magnuson Act). The FMP is implemented by regulations appearing at 50 CFR611.93 and Part 675. The Council, on March 30, 1989, transmitted Amendment12A to the FMP to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review, approvaland implementation under sections 304(a) and 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. The purpose of Amendment 12A is to limit incidental catches of<T3> Chionoecetes bairdi</T3> Tanner crab, red king crab (<T3>Paralithodes camtschatica</T3>), and Pacific halibut (<T3>Hippoglossus stenolepis</T3>) by the groundfish fisheries in the BSAIarea and thus minimize the impact of domestic groundfish fisheries on thesespecies. Such incidental catches are referred to as bycatches in fisheriestargeting other species. The FMP and its implementing regulations definethese species of crabs and halibut as prohibited species which, if caughtwhile fishing for groundfish, must be returned to the sea with a minimumof injury (andSection; 675.20(c)). To achieve this purpose, the Council proposes to specify prohibited speciescatch (PSC) limits for<T3> C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab, red king crab, and halibut, and to apportionthese PSC limits among four specified groundfish fisheries. When a specifiedfishery reaches its apportionment of the PSC limit, it would be prohibitedfrom specified areas or bycatch limitation zones for the remainder of thefishing year. A full description of the proposed amendment is given below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Fishing for groundfish, especially for species of flatfish or other demersalspecies, often involves towing trawl gear in contact with the sea bottom.Other bottom-dwelling species, such as crabs and halibut, are vulnerableto capture by trawl gear in addition to the target species. Pacific halibut,<T3>C. bairdi</T3> Tanner, and red king crabs are among those species definedas prohibited species in the FMP implementing regulations (andSection; 675.20(c)).The Council's policy is to provide additional incentive to avoid bycatchesof Pacific halibut, <T3>C. bairdi</T3> Tanner, and red king crabs by using PSC limits and closedarea controls. The Council's policy attempts to balance these controlswith a reasonable opportunity for trawl fisheries to harvest their targetspecies. The reason for this policy is that discarding crab and halibutis wasteful and may adversely affect their use as target species in othercommercial fisheries, and potentially result in their being overfished.The Council has debated and heard public testimony on this bycatch issuesince 1986. At its January 1986 meeting, the Council heard evidence indicatingthat populations of<T3> C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab and red king crab were dangerously lowin abundance. The bycatch of these species in domestic trawl fisheriesfor groundfish could contribute significantly to the fishing mortalityof these crab species. If excessive, this source of fishing mortality mayretard the rebuilding of these crab stocks and adversely affect futurecrab fisheries. However, excessive bycatch controls could impose undueoperating costs on the development of the domestic groundfish fisheries.The Council referred the bycatch issue to its Bycatch Committee for itsconsideration. The committee recommended PSC limits and area closures whenthe limits were attained. These recommended bycatch controls were compromisesnegotiated by the crab and groundfish fishing interests represented onthe Bycatch Committee and, as such, define at what levels the bycatch ofprohibited species will be considered excessive. Most of the recommendationswere implemented in 1987 as part of Amendment 10 to the FMP (52 FR 8592,March 16, 1987). The Council intended for the bycatch control measures of Amendment 10 toexpire at the end of 1988, due to uncertainty about fluctuations in populationlevels of prohibited species and development of domestic groundfish fisheries.During the effective period of the bycatch provisions implemented underAmendment 10, the Council developed similar but more comprehensive bycatchcontrols for 1989 and 1990, which it adopted at its December 1988 meeting.These controls are recommended to the Secretary as Amendment 12A to theFMP and are described below. As with the Amendment 10 controls, Amendment12A reflects an effort to balance between excessive bycatch and unnecessarilyhigh operating costs to control bycatch of prohibited species in the groundfishfishery. As such, the Council has determined that its recommended bycatchcontrols should provide the domestic groundfish fishery sufficient opportunityto harvest the total allowable catch of groundfish, while minimizing thewasteful discard of incidentally harvested prohibited species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Proposed Bycatch Management </ITAG>The proposed bycatch management program that would be implemented, if FMPAmendment 12A is approved by the Secretary, has six principal features.They are described as follows: 1. Effective period Bycatch management measures implemented under Amendment l2A would remaineffective through December 31, 1990, unless earlier superseded by a subsequentFMP or regulatory amendment. For PSC accounting purposes, bycatch of craband halibut is credited to the specified fisheries from the beginning ofthe fishing year. 2. Bycatch limitation zones Three bycatch limitation zones are proposed (see Figure 2). Zones l and2 would be identical to those under Amendment 10. A new halibut protectionzone, Zone 2H, is proposed in that part of Zone 2 that is south of 56anddegrees;30andmin16;N. latitude and between 165anddegrees; and 170anddegrees; W. longitude. Thesezones describe areas in which crabs and halibut are especially abundant.Approximately 88 percent of the total red king crab population is estimatedto be within Zone . 1. About 98 percent of the C. <T3>bairdi </T3>Tanner crab population is estimated to be within Zonesl and 2 combined and about 60 percent in only Zone 2. Pacific halibut aremore broadly distributed in the Bering Sea than are crab species. However,Zones 1 and 2H combined encompass an area known for high abundance of juvenilehalibut and for seasonal migration of halibut between deep and shallowercontinental shelf waters. Sequential closing of these zones to groundfishfisheries which have attained their share of the PSC limits provides fora reduction in bycatch rates without prohibiting the fisheries access toall Bering Sea groundfish resources. Similarly to Amendment 10, proposed regulations that accompany Amendment12a would close an area within Zone 1 south of 58anddegrees; N latitude andbetween 160anddegrees; and l62anddegrees; W. longitude to all fishing withtrawl gear. Under the proposed Amendment 12A, the western boundary of thisclosed area would be extended to 163anddegrees; W. longitude during the periodMarch 15 through June l5. The purpose of the year-long closure between160anddegrees; and 162anddegrees; W. longitude is to protect red king crabsand <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crabs from trawl gear. The red king crab stockcontinues at depressed population levels and this area is considered theprincipal locus of the stock. The seasonal extension of the closed areais intended to provide additional protection to red king crabs, especiallyfemales during a critical molting and mating period when their shells aresoft and more vulnerable to damage by trawl gear. This measure is basedon a l988 scientific survey of red king crab distribution, which indicatesa significant movement of red king crabs, especially mature female animalsinto this area. An exception to the closed area and its seasonal extension is providedin that part of the area south of a line approximating the 25 fathom isobath.This exception applies only to directed fishing for Pacific cod, providedthat the PSC limit of 12,000 red king crabs is not exceeded. This exceptionis similar to that provided during 1987 and 1988 under Amendment 10. Thepurpose of this exception is to alIow fishing for Pacific cod in that partof the closed area in which crab bycatch has been demonstrated to be relativelylow. 3. Fisheries Specified PSC limits would apply to the following domestic annual processing(DAP) and joint venture processing (JVP) trawl fisheries: (a) ``DAP flatfish fishery'' means DAP fishing which, on a weekly basis,retains in the aggregate yellowfin sole, rock sole, and ``other flatfish''in an amount that is 20 percent or more of the total amount of groundfishretained. (b) ``DAP other fishery'' means DAP fishing which, on a weekly basis, retainsgroundfish that is 95 percent or more pollock, or 50 percent or more pollockand Pacific cod in the aggregate, or any other combination of groundfishspecies that would not qualify such fishing as a ``flatfish fishery.''(c) ``JVP flatfish fishery'' means JVP fishing which, on a weekly basis,delivers in the aggregate yellowfin sole, rock sole, and ``other flatfish''in the aggregate to foreign vessels in an amount that is 20 percent ormore of the total amount of groundfish delivered. (d) ``JVP other fishery'' means JVP fishing which, on a weekly basis, deliversto foreign vessels groundfish that is 95 percent or more pollock, or 50percent or more pollock and Pacific cod in the aggregate, or any othercombination of groundfish species that would not qualify such fishing asa ``flatfish fishery.'' Foreign directed fishing would not be affected by this proposed rule. Allocationsof groundfish in the BSAI area for foreign directed fishing have not occurredsince 1987. If such an allocation were made during the effective periodof the proposed rule, existing PSC limits specified in the foreign fishingregulations (andSection; 611.93) would apply to foreign fishing. 4. PSC Limits For <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crab, the PSC limit would be 1,000,000 animalsin Zone 1 and 3,000,000 animals in Zone 2. These PSC limits represent acompromise between the groundfish trawl fishing industry's position ofone percent of the <T3>C. bairdi</T3> population as a PSC limit and the crab fishing industry'sposition of keeping the PSC limit to the minimum necessary. The most recentpopulation size estimate of this crab species is 630 million animals. Hence,a PSC limit based on the trawl fishing industry's position would be about6.3 million animals for Zones 1 and 2 combined. Although the proposed PSClimit is about 63 percent of what trawl fishermen wanted, it is 9.8 timesgreater than the <T3>C. bairdi </T3>PSC limits for Zones 1 and 2 under Amendment 10. However,these increases are similar to the approximately six-fold increase in theestimated <T3>C. bairdi</T3> population since the 1985 population estimate on whichthe Amendment 10 PSC limits were based.For red king crab in Zone 1, the PSC limit would be specified as 200,000animals. The PSC limit in Zone 1 is 48 percent greater than the Zone 1PSC limit for this species established under Amendment 10. In comparisonwith the 1985 crab survey on which the Amendment 10 PSC limit was based,the 1988 survey indicates relatively no change in total abundance of redking crab or its distribution, which continues to be almost entirely withinthe area defined as Zone 1. However, the age structure of this populationhas changed since 1985; the 1988 survey indicates little recruitment intothe juvenile size classes of red king crabs. Partly for this reason, redking crab continues to be considered depressed by the State of Alaska Departmentof Fish and Game. However, the red king crab bycatch of more groundfishfisheries than under Amendment 10 would be counted against the proposedPSC limit, because Amendment 12a also covers the JVP and DAP ``other fishery''.An additional red king crab PSC limit of 12,000 animals is proposed forfishing under the exception to the closed area described in Zone 1. Two PSC limits are proposed for Pacific halibut taken as bycatch in theentire BSAI area. Attainment of the primary PSC limit of 4,400 metric tons(mt) would effect prohibition of trawl fishing in Zones 1 and 2H combined.Attainment of the secondary PSC limit of 5,333 mt would effect prohibitionof trawl fishing in the entire BSAI area. The halibut PSC limit establishedunder Amendment 10 was 828,000 animals. The average size of halibut takenas bycatch in the groundfish fishery by trawl gear in 1988 was about 1.6kilograms. Using this average size, 828,000 halibut are equivalent to about1,325 mt under the Amendment 10 PSC limit. The proposed increase in thehalibut PSC limit is due partly to an increase in the overall estimatedexploitable biomass of halibut of about two percent between 1985 and 1987to near historical high levels, and partly to the increase in fisheriesin which halibut bycatch would be counted against a PSC limit. 5. Apportionment and monitoring of PSC limits  Each PSC limit will be apportioned among the four specified fisheries inproportion to the anticipated bycatch of each fishery. Anticipated bycatchesfor a fishing year will be derived from a mathematical model that predictsthe total annual unconstrained bycatch by each fishery based on known orestimated bycatches from the most recent previous years. The proportionof a fishery's predicted bycatch to the total predicted bycatch of a specieswill be the share of that species' PSC limit apportioned to that fishery,or its PSC allowance, in the next fishing year. Each PSC allowance will be determined annually by the Director, AlaskaRegion, NMFS (Regional Director), in consultation with the Council, andmade available for public comment concurrently with the notice of preliminaryinitial specification of harvestable amounts of groundfish required underandSection; 675.20(a)(6). A final notice of PSC allowances also will be publishedin Table 2 of part 675 concurrent with the final notice of initial specifications.Existing authority to make inseason adjustments to PSC limits would berevised to provide Secretarial discretion to redistribute a PSC allowancethat is surplus to the actual, or refined projection of actual, bycatchof a fishery. Since this amendment, if approved, would be implemented during 1989, theprocedure described above for developing PSC allowances is not availablefor the 1989 fishing year. Consequently, proposed PSC allowances for 1989appear in Table 2 of this proposed rule. Comments on proposed 1989 PSCallowances should be made in response to this notice in lieu of the procedureabove. Observed or estimated bycatches of crabs and halibut caught with groundfishwill be counted and totals estimated using standard statistical procedures.The total bycatch of crabs and halibut reported or estimated for any oneweek (Sunday through Saturday) reporting period will be credited to thePSC allowance of the DAP or JVP ``flatfish fishery'' if the total amountof groundfish retained or delivered during that reporting period is composedin the aggregate of 20 percent or more of yellowfin sole, rock sole, and``other flatfish'' and less than 50 percent pollock and Pacific cod (inthe aggregate). If the total amount of groundfish retained or deliveredin any one week reporting period is composed of 95 percent pollock, or50 percent or more of pollock and Pacific cod in the aggregate, or anyother combination of groundfish species which does not qualify as ``flatfish,''then the total amount of crabs and halibut taken as bycatch during thatweek will be credited to the PSC allowance of the DAP or JVP ``other fishery.''In the absence of observers on DAP fishing vessels, crab and halibut bycatchesin the DAP fisheries will be calculated from estimated bycatch rates, basedon the best available scientific information. For DAP bycatch accounting purposes, discriminating between the ``flatfish''and ``other'' fisheries will be based on a blend of data from the weeklycatch/receipt reports required of catcher/processors and mothership/processorsunder andSection; 675.5(a)(3)(iv) and the fish ticket reports required ofall DAP fishing vessels under andSection; 675.5(a)(1). For purposes of determiningwhen a DAP PSC limit is attained, the Regional Director may forecast bycatchesof crabs and halibut based on recent weekly catch/receipt and fish ticketreports and pertinent and reliable observer reports, if any. 6. Enforcement When the ``JVP flatfish fishery'' reaches its PSC limit of either <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crab or red king crab in Zone 1, the Secretarywould prohibit the receipt by foreign vessels of groundfish caught fromZone 1 that is composed of 20 percent or more yellowfin sole, rock sole,and ``other flatfish'' for the remainder of the fishing year. Receiptsof groundfish from Zone 1 that contain less than 20 percent of these flatfishspecies and that are consistent with any limits resulting from the ``JVPother fishery,'' may continue. The same prohibition would be enforced inZone 2 when the ``JVP flatfish fishery'' attains its PSC allowance of <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crab in Zone 2. Likewise, when the ``JVP flatfishfishery'' attains its primary PSC allowance of Pacific halibut anywherein the BSAI area (i.e., that derived from the 4,400-mt PSC limit), thenthe Secretary would prohibit the receipt by foreign vessels of groundfishcaught from Zones 1 and 2H that is composed of 20 percent or more yellowfinsole, rock sole, and ``other flatfish'' for the remainder of the fishingyear. When the ``JVP flatfish fishery'' attains its secondary PSC allowanceof Pacific halibut anywhere in the BSAI area (i.e., that derived from the5,333-mt PSC limit), the Secretary would prohibit the receipt by foreignvessels of groundfish caught in any part of the BSAI area.When the ``JVP other fishery'' attains its PSC allowance of either<T3> C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab or red king crab in Zone 1, then the Secretarywould prohibit the receipt by foreign vessels of groundfish caught withbottom trawl gear from Zone 1 that is composed of 20 percent or more pollockand Pacific cod in the aggregate for the remainder of the fishing year.Receipts of groundfish from Zone 1 that contain less than 20 percent pollockand Pacific cod in the aggregate, and that are consistent with any limitsresulting from the ``JVP flatfish fishery,'' may continue. The same prohibitionwould occur in Zone 2 when the ``JVP other fishery'' attains its PSC limitof<T3> C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab in Zone 2. When the ``JVP other fishery''attains its primary and secondary PSC allowances of Pacific halibut (i.e.,those derived from the 4,400-mt and 5,333-mt PSC limits, respectively),then the Secretary would prohibit the receipt by foreign vessels of groundfishcaught with bottom trawl gear in Zones 1 and 2H or anywhere in the BSAIarea, respectively, that is composed of 20 percent or more pollock andPacific cod in the aggregate. When the ``DAP flatfish fishery'' attains its PSC allowance of either<T3> C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab or red king crab in Zone 1, then the Secretarywould prohibit DAP directed fishing for yellowfin sole, rock sole, and``other flatfish'' for the remainder of the fishing year in Zone 1. Directedfishing is defined at andSection; 675.2. When the ``DAP flatfish fishery''attains its PSC allowance of<T3> C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab in Zone 2, then the Secretary would prohibitDAP directed fishing for yellowfin sole, rock sole, and ``other flatfish''for the remainder of the fishing year in Zone 2. When the ``DAP other fishery'' attains its PSC allowance of either<T3> C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab or red king crab in Zone 1, then the Secretarywould prohibit DAP directed fishing with bottom trawl gear for pollockand Pacific cod for the remainder of the fishing year in Zone 1. The sameprohibition would occur in Zone 2 when the ``DAP other fishery'' attainsits PSC allowance of<T3> C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab in that zone. This prohibition would occurin Zones 1 and 2H when the ``DAP other fishery'' attains its primary PSCallowance of Pacific halibut (i.e., that derived from the 4,400-mt PSClimit) taken anywhere in the BSAI area. When the ``DAP other fishery''attains its secondary PSC allowance of Pacific halibut (i.e., that derivedfrom the 5,333-mt PSC limit) taken anywhere in the BSAI area, then DAPdirected fishing for pollock and Pacific cod with bottom trawl gear wouldbe prohibited in the entire BSAI area. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>This proposed rule is published under section 304(a)(1)(C) of the MagnusonAct as amended by Pub L. 99-659, which requires the Secretary to publishregulations proposed by the Council within 15 days of receipt of the fisherymanagement plan amendment and regulations. At this time the Secretary hasnot determined that the amendment these regulations would implement isconsistent with the national standards, other provisions of the MagnusonAct, and other applicable law. The Secretary, in making these determinations,will take into account the data and comments received during the commentperiod. The Council prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for this amendmentand concluded that there will be no significant impact on the environmentas a result of this rule. A copy of the EA may be obtained from the Councilat the address above and comments on it are requested. The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of NOAA (Under Secretary)has preliminarily determined that this proposed rule is not a ``major rule''requiring a regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291. Thisdetermination is based on the EA/RIR/IRFA prepared by the Council, whichconcluded that past industry performance and public testimony indicatethat the trawl fisheries will be able to reduce their bycatch rates forhalibut and avoid early closures. Under some scenarios discussed in theRIR, losses to the trawl fisheries could exceed $400 million in gross revenues.NOAA therefore invites comments addressing the likelihood that the trawlfleet will be able to reduce bycatch rates to the point that the impactwould be less than $100 million. A copy of the EA/RIR/IRFA may be obtainedfrom the Council at the address above. The Under Secretary concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, wouldhave significant effects on small entities. These effects have been discussedin the EA/RIR/IRFA, a copy of which may be obtained from the Council atthe address above. The Under Secretary determined that this proposed rule does not containa collection of information requirement subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct. The Council determined that this rule, if adopted, will be implementedin a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with theapproved coastal zone management program of Alaska. This determinationhas been submitted for review by the responsible State agencies under section307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. This proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>50 CFR Part 611 Fisheries, Foreign fishing.50 CFR Part 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 27, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
