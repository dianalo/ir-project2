(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State Gentry Crowell, whoshot himself in the head last week as a corruption probe tightenedaround his office, died Wednesday after doctors declared himbrain-dead.   Crowell, who was not implicated personally in the investigation,had been in a coma since shooting himself once with a .38-caliberrevolver at his home Dec. 12.   His condition worsened Tuesday night as tests showed arestricted blood flow to the brain. Final tests showed little bloodflow, and doctors decided Wednesday to remove him from life-supportsystems, said Dr. Joseph C. Ross, an associate vice chancellor atVanderbilt University Medical Center.   ``He essentially was found to have no brain function,'' Rosssaid. ``It was comparable to an extensive or massive stroke.''   Crowell, 57, never regained consciousness after the shooting. Hehad remained in critical condition and was treated with intravenousinjections of a drug designed to remove fluids from the brain andreduce swelling.   Gov. Ned McWherter issued a statement of condolence to Crowell'sfamily, who were at the hospital when he died at 1:19 p.m.   ``This is a sad and unfortunate time for his wife, Terrijean,and their children, Melissa, Chris and Brooks,'' McWherter said.   James W. Simmons was appointed by McWherter on Tuesday to fillCrowell's role until the Jan. 9 convening of the Legislature, whichcan appoint a successor.   Controversy, much of it growing out of his passionate devotionto the Democratic Party, followed Crowell during most of his 18years in state government.   He was once known as ``The Godfather'' on Capitol Hill becauseof his absolute, partisan control over legislation in the dualroles of chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and the HouseCalendar Committee.   As secretary of state, he was in charge of regulating bingo andspending by lobbyists and political campaigns, all of which wereinvolved in the federal-state investigation into public corruption.   He testified in September and November 1989 before federal grandjuries in Nashville and Memphis investigating bingo corruption inTennessee. He said he was told by federal agents that he was not atarget of the investigation.   As a result of the probe one former Crowell aide, former chiefbingo inspector W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker, has gone to federal prisonin Alabama; his longtime aide, Mary Sue Wright, has been named anunindicted co-conspirator and given immunity from prosecution.   Ms. Wright kept the books on a campaign fund started by Crowelland two other constitutional officers on behalf of Democraticcandidates for the Legislature. She admitted taking thousands ofdollars from the fund, and a federal grand jury in Memphis hassubpoenaed records from it.   The secretary of state's office had regulated charitable bingosince it was legalized for charity fund-raising in 1971. It did notbecome controversial, however, until 1979, when the Legislatureoutlawed bingo on the final day of the session.   After protracted negotiations between the House and Senate, thegame was made legal again in 1980 and the Office of CharitableSolicitations was put in charge. Every year thereafter, theLegislature amended the bingo law in an effort to weed outprofessional gambling.   In October 1987, Crowell revoked the bingo license for aKingsport AmVets post on grounds the group gave little of itsprofits to charity. The case was appealed up to the state SupremeCourt, which ruled bingo an unconstitutional lottery in February1989.</TEXT></DOC>
