The Richmond, Va., transportation company said service disruptions and damage caused by Hurricane Hugo also contributed to the earnings decline.    Net was $94 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with $120 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share figures reflect a stock repurchase program launched in October 1988.    Rail operating profit declined 55% to $110 million, from $170 million. The drop resulted mainly from declines in almost all commodity groups, including coal.    Revenue was flat at $1.89 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, CSX closed at $35.25 a share, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
