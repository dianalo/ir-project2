The army confirmed hospital reports that Fayiz Aish el-Nadr waskilled in the Gaza Strip in a clash with troops and said it wasinvestigating the circumstances of his death.   Arab hospital officials said another Palestinian youth, MonesAbdel Jawad Mohammed Faris, 16, died Sunday of wounds he sustainedin a clash Wednesday in the Gaza town of Khan Yunis. Officials saidFaris had been shot in the neck and the head.   The deaths raised to 529 the Palestinian death toll in the19-month-old uprising against Israeli rule. Thirty-eight Israelishave also died.   Also Sunday, an Israeli soldier was wounded in a firebomb attackon an army patrol in the open-air market in Nablus, the West Bank'slargest city, the army said.   Troops launched a search for the attackers and clamped a curfewon the market and on a nearby neighborhood, the army said. Thecurfew forced about 40,000 residents to stay indoors, Arabreporters said.   The radio and Arab reporters in Nablus said the army patrolresponded to the attack with gunfire, and the military later put uproadblocks throughout the city.   The attack followed a night march by about 60 uniformed andmasked supporters of PLO chief Yasser Arafat. They raised anoutlawed Palestinian flag and called through loudspeakers for PLOfactions to unite under Arafat's Fatah wing, Arab journalists said.   In another development, a police spokesman in Jerusalem calledthe arson attack on a Jewish-owned house in the Old City's Moslemquarter Saturday night a nationalist assault.   Spokesman Avi Zelba said the house was heavily damaged when theassailants broke in, poured flammable material and lit it. Noinjuries were reported.   Several hundred Jews, including religious seminary students,live in the Moslem quarter, which is home to 23,000 Arabs. FourJewish families moved into the Moslem quarter last month, andIsraeli media said the arson attack seemed a warning to them.   Also Sunday, Army radio and the Hadashot daily quoted MahmoudAli Shaaban, 22, of the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, asconfessing to the stabbing murder of two inmates at the southerndesert Ketziot prison camp for Palestinians on Saturday.
