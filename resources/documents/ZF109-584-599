it alsoincorporates DDE.andM;Despite the legions of applications available for Microsoft Windows, databasemanagement systems are still noticeably absent.andP;  Major database vendors haveannounced intentions to build Windows versions of their products; none haveyet to deliver.andM;Fortunately, there's Q+E, a $149 Windows-based database editor from PioneerSoftware.andP;  Previous versions of the program supported querying, viewing,editing, and updating of dBASE-compatible databases.andP;  This latest version,2.5, extends Q+E's connectivity prowess to SQL Server databases; it also runsunder Windows 3.0, and simplifies and extends the user interface.andM;The program's database mechanism is hidden.andP;  Once you load the databasedrivers (as Dynamic Link Libraries) you needn't worry about the details ofdealing with that database system.andP;  Drivers for other applications can beintegrated as they become available.andM;Q+E is quite powerful.andP;  You can open multiple database files in separatequery windows, perform relational joins between them, and edit and buildindexes against them.andP;  You can even save the query definition as a separateentity from the query results and re-use it.andP;  Since Q+E supports the WindowsClipboard and Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), Q+E can act as a data server forother Windows programs (see sidebar).andM;Q+E's commands are identical regardless of which database you're workingwith, and its Excel-like interface is flexible.andP;  If you don't like a columnwidth in Q+E's display of the database, you can click on the column borderand move it.andP;  You can move, reorder, or delete columns, and create computedcolumns (including minimums, maximums, averages, and totals).andP;  A variety offonts help make data more readable.andM;There are two ways to build a Q+E query--using SQL query or dialog boxes.andO;SQL is accessible via a dialog box, and if you're familiar with SQL, you canuse this directly.andM;If not, using the selection dialogs, you can set row and search selectionconditions with a few mouse clicks, choosing from standard relationalconditions (equal, not equal, greater than) as well as LIKE and NOT LIKE.andO;Until you reset the selection criteria, Q+E assumes that subsequentselections are connected to previous ones, and will offer AND or ORconnections.andP;  You can easily change the window to display only the data youneed, in the form you need.andM;Relational joins are powerful, but easy.andP;  All you do is open a query windowon each of the tables to be joined, click on the JOIN columns, and select theJOIN command.andP;  You can combine three or more files, joint additional windowsto the results, and create either one-to-one or one-to-many relationships.andM;Q+E provides form-editing facilities to view and edit individual records andspecify layout details.andP;  However, these are not nearly as detailed as thosefound in Superbase 2.andM;To prevent confusion and optimize speed, Q+E doesn't re-sort or reselectrecords if you make a change to a key field or selection column during theediting process.andP;  However, you can reinvoke a query against the table uponrequest.andP;  Q_E can also be installed in a secure read-only mode.andP;  Queryresults are saved to any Q+E-supported database formats: dBASE II, III+ andIV, Microsoft SQL Server, and text files.andP;  Results can be printed to aprinter, a file, or even as mailing labels.andM;One of the most intriguing features in Q+E is its ability to save a querydefinition as a view, or virtual table.andP;  These definitions behave liketraditional relational views.andP;  You can edit them, join them to other tablesor views, and save them as if they were real tables.andM;DDE support lets you create a hotlink between any Windows-based, nondatabaseapplication and the Q+E query windows.andP;  So, for example, you can define anExcel cell formula based on the result of a Q+E query.andP;  Whenever the databasetable associated with the query changes, the cell is updated.andM;Version 2.5 of Q+E gets an enthusiastic greeting.andP;  Now database users who useWindows don't have to wait to access their information.andM;THE MICROSOFT CONNECTIONandM;For over a year now, Microsoft has been making Q+E available to Excel usersat an exceptional price.andP;  for $9.95, a coupon enclosed with the Excel packagecan be redeemed for a copy of Q+E.andP;  Owners of older copies of Excel canpurchase Q+E from Microsoft for $49.andM;Why is Microsoft subsidizing the sale of a database editor for itsspreadsheet users?andP;  Simple.andP;  Windows' DDE saved Microsoft from having to adddatabase access features to Excel.andP;  Instead, Excel users can use Q+E toaccess a variety of popular database files.andM;Pioneer Software made it incredibly easy to use Q+E with Excel.andP;  When youinstall Q+E, you're given two options.andP;  The first automatically loads Q+Eevery time you start Excel, via a statement in your WIN.INI file.andP;  The secondrelies on an Excel macro, QE.XLM, provided with Q+E.andP;  Running the macro whenyou start Excel adds new commands to Excel's Data menu.andM;Both of these options allow you to start the Q+E application, designate whichdatabase you want to access, transfer data from a table into a worksheet,query a table, and then create SQL statements for Q+E to execute fromMicrosoft Excel.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
