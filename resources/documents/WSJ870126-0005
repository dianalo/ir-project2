Hofmann, the collector of Mormon historical documents who was charged with first-degree murder in two bombing deaths, pleaded guilty here to reduced charges of second-degree murder.    His plea to the lesser offense means he won't face execution for the killings. He was sentenced to five years to life, with the judge recommending he serve &quot;the remainder of his life in prison.&quot;    In October 1985, he killed Salt Lake City investor J. Gary Sheets's wife Kathleen with a pipe bomb prosecutors said was intended for the real estate investor. With another bomb, he killed Mr. Sheets's friend and former partner Steven Christensen the same day. Prosecutors alleged the bombs were intended to kill Messrs. Sheets and Christensen before they could disclose the collector had forged documents sold to the Mormon Church, Mr. Sheets and other collectors.    The collector Friday also pleaded guilty to two counts of theft by deception for the sale of some of the documents.    Mr. Sheets, whose CFS Financial Corp. investment concern collapsed into insolvency in September 1985 at a cost to investors of close to $150 million, was the subject of a page-one article in The Wall Street Journal last month. He faces a number of civil complaints that he defrauded investors and creditors. </TEXT></DOC>
