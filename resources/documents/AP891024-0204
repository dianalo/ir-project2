In all, 124 were injured, 35 hospitalized and at least two diedin the blasts at the plant Monday. Twenty-two other workers weremissing and presumed dead on Tuesday.   Maintenance worker Roby Clemons said that employees had 20seconds to escape after a warning message was broadcast over theplant's emergency radio.   Workers said they heard a hissing sound and saw a white cloud.The explosion that followed knocked them off their feet.   ``Each area has an evacuation area, but in some cases you justrun. We just ran. There's nothing you can do but run,'' said LonnieOgden, a plant worker for 14 years.   The explosion sent pieces of metal and concrete flying throughthe air, he said.   ``I dove underneath a front-end loader until I didn't seeanything else coming down. It was bad. I heard a big hiss, then Iseen a cloud. I knew something was wrong. Something like thathappens so quick. You can't do anything about it. ''   The plant tested its emergency alarm system every Monday,officials said. The alarms had been tested in the morning beforeMonday's blast and there were no problems, said Greg Derrick, aPhillips spokesman in Bartlesville, Okla.   Alex Diaz, a general maintenance employee, said the plant had anevacuation plan, but the volume of Monday's accident rendered itobsolete.   ``Just the size of it ... you just have to get out of there.''   Phillips spokesman Jere Smith said he did not know when the lastevacuation plan was practiced.   According to Elizabeth Gonzalez, a deputy coordinator of thePasadena Emergency Management Office, the Phillips plant was thescheduled site for an annual emergency drill scheduled for Nov. 8.   ``It's an annual drill, and we were working on some of the areaswe identified as deficiencies in our 1988 drill ... elements oftriage and communications,'' she said.   ``We take safety very seriously. I can't explain at this timewhat happened down there,'' said Bill Stoltz, Phillipsenvironmental director. ``We're awaiting getting in there to make afull assessment on that.''   Crews of nearby chemical plants as well as fire departments fromHouston, Pasadena, Deer Park, and LaPorte responded to Monday'saccident. They were among various firefighting crews from 96factories and six cities in the area that formed a collectiveemergency response plan in 1955, in the wake of major accidents andfires along the Houston Ship Channel.   One such accident was a 1947 explosion in which a freightercarrying fertilizer blew up at a Texas City dock, killing 512people and injuring 4,000.</TEXT></DOC>
