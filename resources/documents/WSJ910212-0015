In other words, right about now, someanalysts figure.   But this time around, the stocks present a bit of aproblem for analysts. The stocks have risen steadily forthree months and are trading at multiples of earnings thatare in the high teens and 20s, a level where it's hard forthe Street to slap a bargain label on them.</LP><TEXT>   Price is just one reason that the Street's applause forthe newspaper group tends to sound more polite thanenthusiastic. The other is the long, deep slump in newspaperadvertising, which has been fueled by client mergers andcompeting media, as well as the prospect of stagnantcirculation.   Almost all of the newspaper company stocks have started tocreep back up recently. Some investors are expecting asecond-half recovery, which they hope would pump life intothe papers' listless advertising revenue.   Analysts, who last summer were downgrading newspaperstocks as the ad decline hit one region after another, aregradually upgrading some to their &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;buy&quot; lists. Atthe top of many analysts' ratings are Knight-Ridder, Gannettand Tribune Co.   Newspaper ads are a quick and often accurate barometer ofeconomic fluctuations, analysts say. So if the economy doesrebound in late 1991, newspaper stocks could be among thefirst beneficiaries. Such talk has helped newspaper stockslately stay ahead of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock index.The Sandamp;P index is up 11% from year end. Dow Jones, publisherof this newspaper, has gained 11%; Knight-Ridder, 14%; TimesMirror in Los Angeles, 17%; Gannett, 18%; New York Times Co.,21%; and Tribune Co., 27%.   But Bruce Thorp, analyst at PNC Financial, warns: &quot;Theearly bottom fishers may have to give back these gains wehave seen. We may have a false start here.&quot; With some stocks'price/earnings multiples in the 20s, &quot;there is not a lot ofroom for improvement, which is why I am cautious on thestocks,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't think the prices will go muchhigher, except in tandem with the market.&quot;   One of the more outspoken doubters on newspaper stocks hasbeen Kenneth Berents of Alex. Brown andamp; Sons. He says of thestocks' recent rally: &quot;This is more an anticipation of arecovery than of any real sign that something is going tohappen.&quot;   Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence says, &quot;The group has ralliednicely, but not one&quot; of the stocks is near the previous highsreached in the late 1980s -- &quot;nor will they reach it thistime.&quot;   Industry fundamentals appear weaker than at any time inthe past two decades. Classified advertising, newspapers'most profitable revenue stream, continues to decline in mostregions, reflecting sharply lower volumes of help-wanted ads.Retailers' ad spending is expected to grow at an anemic ratein 1991, with linage at many major papers down again on afull-year basis. And selling more papers during wartime mayonly mean higher paper and overtime costs.   Some optimists say the ad slump will end in mid-1991. Moreare upbeat about 1992, with its presidential elections andOlympic Games; such years usually are good for ad-dependentindustries. In 1988 the sports-politics events barely movedthe ad meter at all, but 1992 could provide the stimulusneeded to stir demand for advertising, says Lisa Donneson ofCounty NatWest USA. &quot;If advertising recovers and the economyrecovers,&quot; she says, newspapers will be a good group.   Others say there are too many ifs. Skeptics point toDecember's PaineWebber Media Conference, in which publisherswarned of a gloomy 1991 with little if any improvement inearnings, and quite possibly declines. Most major papers havedone what they promised: cut editorial staff, news space andtravel budgets, and even closed some printing plants. Butanalysts recommend only some of the stocks.   Several have upgraded Tribune Co., citing its plan to sellor close the New York Daily News if it can't get concessionsfrom striking unions. The same strike also has led someanalysts to upgrade Times Mirror, publisher of New YorkNewsday. Amid the strike, Newsday has boosted circulation andad rates; it could be profitable this year, two years aheadof schedule.   Later in the year, analysts say, Affiliated Publications,publisher of the Boston Globe, and New York Times could growmore attractive. The New York Times, which yesterday postedfourth-quarter profit of 16 cents a share compared with ayear-earlier loss, will open a money-saving color printingplant later this year. &quot;{The newspapers'} upside could begreat when things eventually turn,&quot; Mr. Appert says. The costcutting will pay off as newspapers come out of a recession;&quot;earnings will rebound sharply&quot; as advertising revives.   Mr. Thorp of PNC Financial isn't convinced. &quot;If you reallywant to get back into the newspaper stocks, put it in Gannettand Knight-Ridder,&quot; he says. &quot;But there is still room fornear-term earnings disappointments that could be worse thanexpected.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
