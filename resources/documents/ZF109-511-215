Theobject approach simplifies the development of applications that useinformation in highly structured forms.andP;  A compound document that unitestext, graphics, and an image on a single page is one form of structuredinformation.andP;  Such a document could actually be built from three separatekinds of data-text, a bit map, and a digitized image.andP;  In the traditionalapproach to applications, these three kinds of data are imported into anapplication, which determines how they are formatted, how they are displayed,and how they are output.andP;  In the object oriented approach, each type of datacontains its own formatting, display, and output information.andP;  Applicationsmerely assemble the appropriate objects.andP;  Obviously, such applications aremuch simpler to build.andM;Constructing a compound document from objects also allows a variety ofapplications to use and reuse the document's components without having torecreate each object's logic.andP;  In the same way, documents structured ascompound objects can be used and reused by a variety of applications withrelative ease.andM;The object-oriented way of building systems is attractive for two reasons.andM;First, because objects are self-defining, they can be combined in a varietyof ways by a variety of applications.andP;  Objects are not application specific.andO;Developers have an easier time because they don't have to understand thedetails of how an object performs particular functions in order to use thatobject.andP;  Maintenance programmers can also change the implementation of anobject without harming applications that use it.andP;  The result is greatersimplicity in building and maintaining software.andM;Second, developers are able to build software systems faster using theobject-oriented approach.andP;  If objects define data and functions in ways thatare generic, they may be used and reused in many different applications.andP;  Theresult is faster development of new applications-indeed, with objects,software development becomes a process of assembling software modules ratherthan of creating new modules from scratch.andM;DBMS: The Missing Link.andP;  Today, most object-oriented applications are builtusing special languages and development environments that allow data andfunctions to be modeled as objects.andM;Most of these environments don't include DBMSS.andP;  DBMSs provide a way tocapture and manage data modeled using the object-oriented approach, makingobjects available in a consistent way to a variety of applications.andM;As object-oriented modeling and development techniques are applied toapplications such as computer-aided software engineering (CASE),computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided publishing, and integratingcustomer records, the need for appropriate DBMS software has become critical.andO;Most applications in the above categories use file systems only.andP;  RDBMSscan't support their applications-there are too many odd data types such asbit maps and documents, and too many links between pieces of data.andO;Hierarchical and network DBMSs are better at storing data such as bit maps,but they are too rigid in structure to support changing applicationrequirements.andM;WHY OBJECTIVITY.andP;  Digital is a significant player in CAD (particularly inengineering and manufacturing applications), CASE, and document-relatedapplications such as publishing.andP;  Before the Objectivity deal, there was noquestion that the company needed object-oriented database technology to keeppace in these markets.andP;  And several groups within the company have beenbuilding object databases.andP;  The only question was when Digital would deliverits object-oriented database.andM;The decision to work with Objectivity, a small company that focuses only onelectrical CAD (ECAD) applications, was a surprise.andP;  Digital turned its backon its own object database projects because it needed an open solution thatcould be quickly delivered to market.andP;  Objectivity/DB is portable across avariety of computer architectures, although it is available today only on Sunand DECstations.andP;  &quot;CAD and CASE users tend to be heterogeneous sites,&quot; saysLydia Bennett, Digital's product manager for the Objectivity technology.andP;  &quot;Wecouldn't get in with a Digital-only solution.&quot;andM;It's important for Digital to get to market-at least with a technologydirection use so many independent software vendors are building their &quot;nextgeneration&quot; platforms based on object orientation today.andP;  These vendors areselecting foundation technologies such as object DBMSs now.andP;  Digital hopes tohelp these vendors bring advanced tools to its users sooner by announcing itsstrategic object DBMS technology now.andP;  And the Winner Is...andP;  Digital examinedthe database technology of a variety of small vendors before selectingObjectivity.andP;  At least six other small vendors are selling or building objectDBMSs-Ontologic (Burlington, Massachusetts), Object Design (also inBurlington), Object Databases (Cambridge, Massachusetts), Servio Corporation(Portland, Oregon), Versant Object Technology (Menlo Park, California), andItasca Systems (Minneapolis).andP;  Objectivity won the Digital sweepstakes-thebiggest deal yet in this nascent field-with a combination of good technologyand convenient business strategy.andM;* Portability.andP;  Objectivity/DB is designed to ride atop a variety ofoperating environments.andM;* Modular architecture.andP;  Objectivity/DB comprises a series of layered modulesthat are open to change.andP;  For example, the DBMS uses Sun's Network FileSystem and RPC to support distributed database operations today.andO;Hewlett-Packard/Apollo's Network Computing System (NCS) could be substitutedwithout compromising the rest of the DBMS.andM;* DBMS size.andP;  Objectivity uses 48-bit object identifiers, allowing it tosupport terabyte-sized databases.andP;  The other object DBMSs use 32-bitidentifiers, limiting them to databases of 2 GB each.andM;* Complementary strategy.andP;  Objectivity's small direct-sales force isconcentrating only on the electronic CAD market.andP;  Digital win take theObjectivity/DB technology into broader markets.andP;  Thus, die partners willrarely, if ever, directly compete.andM;What Digital Didn't Get.andP;  Digital didn't get everything it wanted withObjectivity/DB.andP;  The biggest gaps in Objectivity's technology are a queryfacility, multiple-language interfaces, and advanced development tools.andM;Objectivity/DB doesn't have a query facility.andP;  That means it doesn't providea way for users or applications to retrieve data by sorting it according tocriteria.andP;  This is the kind of operation that SQL supports.andM;Objectivity/DB only allows users and applications to access data according toits structure, a mode commonly referred to as navigation.andP;  For example, youcould ask for a list of graphic elements associated with a particular printadvertisement.andP;  Objectivity/DB would find the objects that comprise theadvertisement and list their names.andM;Objectivity/DB provides one language interface@++, an object-orientedextension of the C language.andP;  C++ is a hot language, but there are stillthousands more programmers working in Cobol, Fortran, Ada, and otherlanguages than there are programmers working in C++.andM;Objectivity/DB is a database engine, not a full development environment Thismeans that applications must be written in C++-there are no fourth-generationlanguages or graphical tools to help speed programming.andP;  Objectivity'sstrategy is to use its open architecture to attract tools vendors to helpbuild up a full environment.andM;Digital will work with Objectivity to fill each of these gaps in ajoint-development arrangement.andP;  Both vendors will have access to the jointlydeveloped technology.andP;  Query is likely to be the toughest challenge, but weexpect to see at minimum an SQL-based mechanism appear before too long.andP;  Theeasiest task is likely to be building a strong set of advanced developmenttools.andP;  Digital has a very robust programming environment callandM;Trellis that we expect it to adapt to Objectivity/DB.andM;OBJECT DBMS STRATEGY.andP;  With the Objectivity deal, Digital has settled on astrategy for adopting OBMS technology.andP;  But it is still formulating amarketing strategy.andP;  The Database Systems Group is an engineeringorganization-not a product marketing group.andP;  For the immediate future,Digital will market its Objectivity/DB technology to early adopters,primarily independent software vendors in CAD and CASE, and aerospacecompanies.andM;Part of Lydia Bennett's job is to help Digital's product groups formulateeffective applications strategies outside of CAD and CASE.andP;  This strategy winunfold over the several quarters.andP;  The Objectivity technology will be offeredas part of vertical packages first-with the emphasis initially on CAD, CASE,document-intensive applications, medical information management, and thegeographic information systems used by oil companies, telecommunicationscarriers, and transportation companies.andM;Eventually, after it has educated its broad base of customers, Digital hopesto be able to sell its OBMS as a general facility, giving customers a choiceof network, relational, and object database technology to support theirapplications.andM;CONCLUSIONS.andP;  We admire die foresight of Digital's Database Systems Group.andO;Not only did it grasp the potential of OBMSS, it also recognized that the oldways of doing business don't apply in an era of open systems.andP;  During theearly 1980s, Digital was faced with a similar situation as RDBMS technologyhit the market Digital almost decided to work with Oracle at that time, bu%in the end, decided to compete with Oracle.andP;  Digital clearly has decided notto repeat that folly in approaching the latest DBMS technology.andP;  The equityinvestment Digital made in Objectivity as part of the deal suggests theseriousness of its commitment.andM;The strategy also recognizes that the object-oriented technology is likely tobe adopted first through vertical applications.andP;  The vendors who are makingmoney in the field bring to customers platform technology-languages andDBMS-and knowledge of a specialized field such as money management Digitalknows certain fields very well, including insurance, medical, documentprocessing, and laboratory management.andP;  Its strategy will succeed if itleverages this knowledge and finds partners to work with it in areas itdoesn't know as well.andM;The challenges for Digital will be in delivering on the promise ofObjectivity's technology in a way that preserves the openness and portabilityof the base product.andP;  For example, we hope Digital's SQL query facility is inline with whatever standards emerge in that area.andM;Digital's deal with Objectivity gives it a fast start in a new technology.andO;Now we'll see what the company does with its advantage.andP;  Digital's majorcompetitors, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, are both pursuing their ownobject-oriented data management strategies.andP;  And there's always die chancethat one of the small object DBMS vendors will become another Oracle.andP;  Evenat this early stage of the technology's adoption, there's really not muchroom for error.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
