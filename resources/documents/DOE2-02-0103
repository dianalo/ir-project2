<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0103 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Phillippine Archipelago has a composite geologic structure arisingfrom the multi-stage development of volcanic-tectonic events evidencedby volcanism and seismic activity occurring along the active blocks ofthe major structural lines which traverse most of the major islands ofthe Phillipines. The widespread volcanic activity located along the activetectonic block has generated regions of high heat flow, where a vastnumber of potential rich geothermal resources could be exploited as analternative source of energy. As part of a systematic geothermal developmentprogram launched by the Philippine government after the successful pilotstudy at the Tiwi geothermal field in 1967 by the Commission on Volcanology(now called the Philippine Institute of Volcanology-PIV), the Philippinesdeveloped four geothermal fields in the period 1972-84. These four areas,Tiwi in Albay, Mak-Ban in Laguna, Tongonan in Leyte, and Palinpinon inSouthern Negros, have already contributed 891 MW installed capacity tothe total electrical power supply of the country, which is mainly dependenton oil resources. The Philippines envisaged that, with its acceleratedgeothermal energy programme, it would be able to achieve its target ofreducing the country's dependence on imported fossil fuel by about 20%within the next decade through the utilization of its vast geothermalenergy resources.</TEXT></DOC>
