In the administration's view, the Contras have kept the focus ofNicaragua's leftist government on surviving, preventing it frompromoting the spread of revolution elsewhere.   As a result, the administration says, each of Nicaragua'sneighbors has been able consolidate or at least make a beginning onbuilding democratic institutions.   Reagan's worst-case scenario for the region _ a belt ofpro-Soviet states extending from the Panama Canal to Guatemala withthe possibility that Mexico itself ultimately will be threatened _has not been borne out. He believes the Contras deserve much of thecredit.   But the other view is that the costs of the policy have beenexorbitant, far outweighing the benefits.   Administration critics maintain that American backing for theContras has led to tens of thousands of dead and wounded and setback the Nicaraguan economy by a generation.   And Nicaragua has been, in some ways, a wrecker of reputations,playing the same role that Vietnam did two decades ago.   On Wednesday, the same day that Reagan decided to send U.S.troops to Honduras, a federal grand jury indicted former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North andtwo of their associates, Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.   As independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh described it, ``theheart of the case'' against the four was their role in divertingfunds from Iran arms sales to the Contras.   Poindexter and North, two of the most influential figures ingovernment less than a year and a half ago, face the prospect ofextended jail terms because they are alleged to have disregardedthe law in their zeal to support the Contras.   The Contra cause has divided American public opinion more thanany other issue during Reagan's presidency. No other dispute hasgenerated more distrust and acrimony between the administration andthe Congress.   While Reagan has compared the Contras with America's foundingfathers, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., calls them ``ourterrorists.'' Both sides believe the other's policies will leadinevitably to an American troop commitment in the region.   The U.S. policy has fluctuated over the years. The Contras tookup arms with American encouragement but now live month to monthwithout knowing whether they can count on continued U.S. backing.   Their latest setback had its origins in the Feb. 29 cutoff ofU.S. aid. Within days, the Sandinistas began preparations for anoffensive against a rebel concentration in the Bocay Valley nearthe Honduran border.   As described by Bosco Matamoros, a Contra spokesman, the rebelswere left virtually without food and other supplies and the meansto evacuate their wounded. The Sandinistas, whose offensive gotunder way in earnest on Tuesday, claim the Contra death toll is inthe hundreds.   Reagan administration officials say that if the Sandinistassucceed in destroying a key supply depot in the area, the impact onthe remaining 10,000 or so Contras deployed elsewhere in Nicaraguacould be decisive, both materially and psychologically.   Administration critics say none of this would have happened ifReagan had not been so foolish as to believe the Contras could haveprevailed against the Sandinistas in the first place or to thinkthat such a small, poor country could represent any threat at allto U.S. security.   The administration counters that Congress is to blame, and thatreliable U.S. support for the Contras would have eventuallyproduced a Sandinista surrender, ushering in peace and democracy inCentral America.   The administration's problem all along has been that it can'tprove its worst-case scenario, unless it happens.   If indeed the collapse of the Contras leads to the communizationof Central America and a new security situation for the UnitedStates, Reagan will have been proven correct.   But if that day ever comes, Reagan will be long gone and asuccessor administration will have to deal with the consequences.
