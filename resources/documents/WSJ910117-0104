Yesterday, Bank of New York shares rose 87.5 cents toclose at $17.375 in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading. Fleet shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $9.625;Norwest shares gained 50 cents to close at $20; Republicshares rose 25 cents to close at $47.50; Continental sharesgained 50 cents to close at $9.125, all in Big Boardcomposite trading.                                                                                                          Bank of New York                                                                                                          Bank of New York's sharp drop in net income reflects a$153 million provision for loan losses, more than triple theyear-earlier amount of $42.8 million.   &quot;We again felt it prudent to build our loan reserve as thelevel of nonperforming assets increased in this uncertaineconomic environment,&quot; said Chairman J. Carter Bacot. &quot;Ifrecessionary conditions continue, further additions toreserves may be necessary,&quot; he added.   Nonperforming assets increased 7.8% during the quarter to$1.59 billion from $1.48 billion at Sept. 30. Most of theincrease in nonperforming assets resulted from troubles onsix real estate loans and two loans in highly leveragedtransactions, Bank of New York said. The bank said its totalloans to highly leveraged transactions, most of which areleveraged buyouts, decreased by $251 million during thequarter to $4.22 billion. The decline came mostly from loanrepayments.   The bank also reduced its medium-term loans toless-developed countries to $326 million from $512 million,mostly by reclassifying $144 million of Mexican andVenezuelan loans that are now backed by U.S. Treasurysecurities.   Bank of New York shrank its total assets by 6.9% to $45.46billion at year-end from $48.86 billion a year earlier.Partly because of that shrinkage, net interest income, whichis the difference between interest paid on deposits andreceived on loans, increased only 2% to $348 million from$342 million in the year-earlier quarter.   The net interest rate spread, which is the differencebetween the average rates paid on deposits and received onloans, increased to 2.22% from 1.64% a year earlier. Thewidening spread indicates that the rates paid on deposits andother sources of funding declined more rapidly than the ratescharged on loans.                                                                                                          Fleet/Norstar Financial                                                                                                          At Fleet, based in Providence, R.I., losses caused by thecontinuing real estate slump in the Northeast more thanoffset earnings gains in the company's non-bank financialservices units.   Fleet took a loan-loss provision of $168 million in thefourth quarter, bringing its loan-loss provision for all of1990 to $762.2 million, compared with $160.3 million in 1989.Fleet's total loan-loss reserve increased to $700 million atyear end from $638.7 million at Sept. 30.   Fleet said nonperforming loans rose to $987 million atyear end from $852 million at Sept. 30. Foreclosed realestate assets rose to $398 million at Dec. 31 from $330million at the end of the third quarter.   Fleet said all interest payments received on itsnonperforming assets of $1.39 billion were applied to reducethe principal balances of loans rather than being booked asincome; nonperforming assets at year-end 1990 were about 4.3%of total assets of $32.5 billion.   &quot;Many assets currently classified as nonperformingeventually will prove to be sound,&quot; said Terrence Murray,chairman and chief executive officer. At the end of lastyear, Fleet's nonperforming assets totaled $398.9 million.Net charge-offs in 1990 were $403.9 million, up sharply from$147.2 million in 1989.   Fleet said the increases in nonperforming assets continueto be heavily related to commercial real estate and areprimarily in its Rhode Island, Connecticut and Long Islandbanks.   The company said its mortgage banking, consumer financeand asset-based lending businesses performed well, withearnings up 12% in the fourth quarter.                                                                                                          Continental Bank                                                                                                          Continental's loan-loss provision was $48 million in thequarter, more than double the year-earlier $20 million. Theyear-earlier loss resulted largely from a $62 millionwrite-off related to the bank's decision to sell its FirstOptions of Chicago unit.   Continental said fees, trading and other revenue increased34% and operating expenses declined 10%.   Total nonperforming assets at year-end were $719 million,up modestly from $715 million at Sept. 30. At Dec. 31, 1989,total nonperforming assets were $444 million. The largeincrease from year end 1989 stems from loans to highlyleveraged transactions that were put on nonperforming statusduring the second quarter.   During the fourth quarter, Continental exchanged $138million of Venezuelan debt for $55 million of new bonds and$83 million of fixed-rate bonds backed by U.S. Treasurysecurities. The Treasury-backed bonds aren't classified asless-developed-country debt and as a result of the exchangeand an earlier write-down, Continental's holdings ofVenezuelan debt declined by about $75 million.   Continental also benefited from a 71% rise in tradinggains to $29 million from $17 million a year earlier.   Continental shrank its size by 8.1% to $27.1 billion atyear end from $29.5 billion a year earlier.                                                                                                          Republic New York                                                                                                          Republic's loan-loss provision increased to $17 million inthe quarter from $3 million a year earlier. Nonperformingassets declined slightly to $164.4 million from $165.8million at Sept. 30.   Republic's net was also depressed by $11.9 million ofcharges stemming from the consolidation of Manhattan SavingsBank, which Republic acquired in May. Year-earlier net wasboosted by a $51.2 million gain on the sale of an option topurchase certain real estate.   Net interest income increased 41% to $128.9 million from$91.4 million a year earlier, mostly because of theacquisition of Manhattan Savings.   Total assets increased 16% to $29.6 billion from $25.47billion a year earlier.   Republic also increased its quarterly dividend on commonshares to 35 cents from 33 cents, effective with the dividendto be paid on April 1 to stock of record March 15.

Net interest margin was 4.90%, up from 4.69% in theyear-earlier quarter. Loan-loss provisions in the quarterincreased to $65.7 million from $61 million.   Total assets for the quarter were $27.2 billion, up from$25.6 billion in the year-earlier quarter. As of Dec. 31,Norwest's nonperforming assets rose to $306.7 million, or1.72% of loans and leases and other real estate owned, from$198.6 million.   ---   Diane Tracy and Judith Valente contributed to thisarticle.   ---                           1990            1989                        in      per     in      per     %                     millions  share millions  share   chg.
