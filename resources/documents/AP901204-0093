ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HERNDON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Steve Malarkey was a disgruntled computertechnician looking for a career change when his cat leaped forwardwith an idea.   ``I was sitting in front of the TV with my wife, watching aNational Geographic special on birds of the Cayman Islands orsomewhere,'' he said.   ``Our cat Stick, who never even glanced at TV before, came outof his box like a shot and sat right in front of the screen,growling and meowing.''   Malarkey borrowed a friend's video camera and tripod, scatteredbirdseed and popcorn in his wooded backyard and recorded the anticsof neighborhood birds, squirrels and chipmunks that gathered for anoisy feast.   ``When I brought the tape back to the house and showed it toStick, he went ballistic,'' Malarkey said. ``He was in front of theTV, behind the TV, on top of the TV, knocking things over andswiping at the screen.''   Nice kitty.   Malarkey went into the ``cat business'' in a big way. His``Video Catnip,'' a professional, 25-minute version of the samebackyard scene, is one of the hottest gift items to appear on petstore shelves this Christmas season.   Malarkey says he's sold 7,000 copies since his video hit themarket in September 1989, most of them in the past couple ofmonths. Fewer than 10 tapes have been returned on behalf ofdissatisfied feline viewers, he said.   Human viewers might find ``Video Catnip'' boring after a while.There's just so much excitement in watching a pair of blue jayssquabbling or a squirrel snitching a peanut from a bowl.   But Malarkey, who recently moved from this Washington suburb toMorgantown, W.Va., says it's the purr-fect stocking stuffer for theindoor cat who has everything.   ``Steven Spielberg it ain't,'' he said, ``but we haven't gottenany complaints yet from the cats.''   The tape, which retails for $19.95, promises ``somecat-a-clysmic fun with no paws in the action.'' It starts with thiswarning:   ``While watching this video, your cat may become excited andattempt to get inside your television set to get at the birds. ...We strongly suggest that you remove all breakables from on top oraround your TV set. No kitting.''   The live action is divided into segments titled ``CheepThrills,'' ``Mews and Feather Report'' and ``A Stalk in the Park,''which features plenty of close-up shots of kitty's favoritecreatures cavorting on the TV screen.   Can cats really ``see'' a TV video?   Veterinarians agree with Malarkey that although cats don'tdiscern shapes and colors as distinctly as humans, they are acutelyaware of moving figures and sounds that excite them.   Malarkey says he's plowing the profits from ``Video Catnip''into a series of sequels with ``bigger birds, bigger squirrels,maybe some sea gulls thrown in.''</TEXT><HEAD>---</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITORS' NOTE: Malarkey takes telephone orders at 1-800-TABBYTV.</TEXT></DOC>
