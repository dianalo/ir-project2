Bush said Friday in a letter to House Speaker Jim Wright thatthe trade embargo will continue ``as long as these measures areappropriate,'' but also suggested the sanctions could be lifted iffree elections are held February in Nicaragua.   ``The trade sanctions are an essential element of our policythat seeks a democratic outcome in Nicaragua by diplomatic means,''Bush said in his letter.   ``The policies and actions of the government of Nicaraguacontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to thenational security and foreign policy of the United States,'' hesaid.   The ban covers imports of Nicaraguan goods into the UnitedStates and exports by U.S. firms to Nicaragua _ except goodsdestined for the Contra rebels who have fought for eight years tooverthrow the country's Sandinista government.   The presidential order also prohibits air and ship trafficbetween the two countries.   Bush's order came as a group of members of Congress, bothDemocrats and Republicans, sent a telegram to Nicaraguan PresidentDaniel Ortega on Friday, criticizing the law Nicaragua adopted thisweek to govern its elections scheduled for next February.   The telegram, sent by a group led by Rep. Frank Guarini, D-N.J.,said the law is ``biased, unfair and designed to monopolize powerrather than seek national reconciliation.'' An aide to one of thesponsors provided a copy.   It calls on Ortega to meet jointly with political oppositionleaders and come up with a new election law to comply with thepeace plans adopted by the presidents of the four Central Americandemocracies and Ortega in Esquipulas, Guatemala, in 1987 and inTesoro Beach, El Salvador, this year.   The Bush administration also has expressed strong displeasurewith the new election law, contending it gives the Sandinistagovernment and its candidates an unfair advantage. The StateDepartment said the Sandinistas will dominate the electoral councilthat will run the elections.   Internal opposition parties and the Contra rebels also havestrongly criticized the new law.   An administration source, who commented on condition he not benamed, said the administration was particularly displeased thatOrtega did not meet jointly with the opposition leaders to work outan agreeable election plan, instead meeting with them one at a timeand then pushing the Sandinista proposal, a complaint also made bythe Congress members who sent the telegram.   ``If Nicaragua implements its Esquipulas commitments and holdsfree, fair and honest elections, I believe the emergency thatprompted the prior administration to impose the trade sanctionswould largely be resolved,'' Bush wrote.   Bush's letter reviewed the trade situation with Nicaragua sincethe last administration report of Nov. 9.   Those signing the congressional telegram include Reps. JohnSpratt, D-S.C.; Rod Chandler, R-Wash.; Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.; TomCarper, D-Del.; Ike Skelton, D-Mo.; James Slattery, D-Kan.; RoyRowland, D-Ga.; Steve Gunderson, R-Wis.; John Miller, R-Wash.;Beverly Byron, D-Md., and Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
