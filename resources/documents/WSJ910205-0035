The financial sector of the market got a boost Friday whenthe Federal Reserve Board cut the interest rate that itcharges member banks.</LP><TEXT>   The Fed's action in lowering the benchmark lending ratewas followed by major banks, which passed the savings on toborrowers by lowering their prime, or base, lending rates.The Fed is widely believed to be working aggressively tobolster banking profits and keep the recession from deepeningbecause of a credit crunch.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed steadily all dayafter a mixed opening, ending with a 41.59-point gain at2772.28.   Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index jumped 5.29 to 348.34and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 2.88 to190.28.   Big Board advancers swamped decliners, 1,362 to 359, withonly 333 stocks ending unchanged. New York Stock Exchangevolume totaled a robust 250,750,000 shares, up from Friday's246,670,000.   Some traders attributed at least part of yesterday'sstrength to short covering, as people who sold borrowed stockrushed to buy shares with which to repay their loans.   But Barry Berman, head trader at Robert W. Baird, said hesaw steady &quot;legitimate&quot; buying by long-term investorsthroughout the day.   Mr. Berman has been surprised by the market's continuingadvance. The Dow Jones industrial average has surged a littlemore than 300 points since its January bottom at 2470.30,after talks failed between Secretary of State James Baker andIraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. The market began rocketinga week later after the two nations went to war.   &quot;This has really been dramatic,&quot; said Mr. Berman. But headded that the market is due for a pullback before long.&quot;We've been overextended for a few days,&quot; he asserted.   Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research atJanney Montgomery Scott, said that the market's momentumcould carry the industrial average into the 2900s over thenext five to eight months. Any retreats should be shallow, headded, bringing prices down no more than about 3%. &quot;It's inno danger of being derailed here for now,&quot; said Mr. Peroni.&quot;When the market begins this sort of locomotive movement, itisn't easily thwarted.&quot;   He noted that a rotation in the buying between stocks thathave had a good run and those left behind is keeping themarket healthy. Dow Chemical, for example, broke throughresistance at 48 and rallied to about 53 last week. The stockhas since pulled back, retreating 1/8 to 50 7/8 yesterday.Meanwhile, however, Nalco Chemical broke through resistanceat 58 yesterday, adding 1 7/8 to 59 1/2.   RJR Nabisco's when-issued shares were the market'smost-active issue, ending with a 1/4-point gain to 5 7/8 onvolume of more than 5.5 million shares. The shares are to beissued in the company's debt exchange offer, which began onFriday.   Southern Co. was high on the most-active list individend-related trading. The utility pays a 53.5-centdividend to shares of record yesterday. Its shares ended up1/8 to 26 1/4 on volume of more than three million shares.   Chase Manhattan added 1 1/4 to 14, Chemical Banking was up1 7/8 to 15 1/2, Bankers Trust gained 2 5/8 to 45 andManufacturers Hanover rose 2 3/8 to 25 1/4.   Citicorp was up 1 3/8 to 15. As part of its plan to cutexpenses and refocus on core businesses, the nation's largestbank holding company said it agreed to sell the principalfinancial data processing units of its Citicorp InformationResources unit to Fiserv. Citicorp said the sale will reducestaff by 700 jobs and operating expenses by $75 million.   BankAmerica surged 2 1/4 to 32 1/8. The company boostedits quarterly dividend to 30 cents from 25 cents.   Shawmut National jumped 1 1/4 to 5 5/8. Barron's magazinequoted money manager Marc Perkins as saying that at currentprices the shares of Shawmut National &quot;are being given away.&quot;Mr. Perkins said the banking concern has a book value of morethan $18 a share. The Tisch family, which holds a 5% stake inShawmut, uses Mr. Perkins as an adviser in its bankinvestments.   California thrifts also gained. HomeFed added 1 5/8 to 63/8, UnionFed Financial rose 3/4 to 3 and CalFed added 7/8 to5 1/8.   Oil and gold stocks were again laggards, as both groupsresponded to recent price weakness in their underlyingcommodities.   Among the Dow industrials, Chevron slipped 7/8 to 69 7/8,while Du Pont, which owns Conoco, fell 1/2 to 34 7/8.   USX ended unchanged at 29 1/8. USX Chairman Charles A.Corry said that any gains that USX's Marathon Oil operationsfelt as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis were offset byhigher crude oil prices, because the unit is a net buyer ofcrude oil. Mr. Corry also said he sees &quot;nothing imminent&quot; inthe sale of USX's steel operations. The company reached atentative agreement on a three-year contract with the UnitedSteelworkers of America.   Gold prices rose, but gold stocks continued to slide.
