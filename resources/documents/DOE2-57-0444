<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-0444 </DOCNO><TEXT>The first results from a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of emissionlines of Ha, [NII], [OIII] and [SII] in the WR ring nebula RCW58 arepresented. By combining high spectral resolution and signal-to-noiseratio with fine spatial sampling, we are able to clarify the complexkinematics of this wind-blown nebula which in previous data appearedchaotic. RCW58 consists of a shell expanding at 87 +- 3 kms/sup -1/ fromthe central star and enveloping slower moving clumps of stellar ejecta,probably produced before the turn-on of the WR wind. We derive an upperbound to the age of the wind-blown shell of 3 x 10/sup 4/ yr. Detailedmaps of the different velocity components within the nebula, obtainedby profile-fitting of the emission lines, are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
