<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0759 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report the results of a polarized-{Sigma}{sup -} beta-decay experimentcarried out in the Fermilab Proton Center charged-hyperon beam. Theseresults are based on 49 671 observed {Sigma}{sup -}{yields}ne{sup -}nu-bardecays. The {Sigma}{sup -} beam had a nominal momentum of 250 GeV/c andwas produced by 400-GeV/c protons im- pinging on a Cu target. At a productionangle of 2.5 mrad, the polarization was (23.6 +- 4.3)%. The decay asymmetriesof the electron ({alpha}/sub e/ = -0.519 +- 0.104), neutron ({alpha}/subn/ = +0.509 +- 0.102), and antineutrino ({alpha}/sub {nu}/ = -0.230 +-0.061) were measured and used to establish sign and approximate magnitudeof the axial-vector-to-vector form-factor ratio g{sub 1}/f{sub 1}. Theform-factor ratios {vert_bar}g{sub 1}/f{sub 1}{vert_bar} and f{sub 2}/f{sub1} were determined most sensitively from the neutron and electron center-of-massspectra, respectively. We obtain {vert_bar}g{sub 1}/f{sub 1}-0.237g{sub2}/f{sub 1}{vert_bar} = 0.327 +- 0.007 +- 0.019 and f{sub 2}(0)/f{sub1}(0) = -0.96 +- 0.97 +- 0.13, where the stated errors are statisticaland systematic, respectively. A general fit that includes the asymmetriesand makes the conventional assumption g{sub 2} = 0 gives the final valueg{sub 1}(0)/f{sub 1}(0) = -0.328 +- 0.019. The data are also compatiblewith positive values for g{sub 2}/f{sub 1} combined with correspondingreduced values for {vert_bar}g{sub 1}/f{sub 1}{vert_bar}. .AE</TEXT></DOC>
