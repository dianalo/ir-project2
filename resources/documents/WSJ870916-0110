Among actively traded issues, prices of 30-year Treasury bonds fell more than 1 1/2 points, or over $15 for each $1,000 face amount. The setback erased all of last week's gains. The latest 30-year government bond's yield surged to nearly 9.7%, the highest since December 1985.    Corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bond prices also slumped, while short-term interest rates rose. Fearing the possibility of even higher borrowing costs later this year, several more companies launched large new debt issues. And underwriters rushed to hedge these offerings by selling financial futures and options, exacerbating the bond market's woes.    Robert Schoenthal, co-chief executive officer of L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., contended that it's unrealistic to expect the bond market to improve significantly any time soon. &quot;I think we're going to see the yield on long-term Treasurys rise to 10% this year,&quot; he said. Jason M. Elsas Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc., said there is likely to be &quot;a steady trickle of new corporate offerings because companies are now worried that interest rates may keep rising.&quot;    The bond market's mood is &quot;very negative,&quot; said Alan C. Lerner, a managing director at Bankers Trust Co. &quot;People are convinced inflation and interest rates are going up, so nobody wants to step up and buy bonds.&quot;    The reason so many investors are worried about inflation is &quot;the dollar's weakness,&quot; Mr. Lerner said. &quot;It's been drummed into us by every policymaker, including Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, that a weak dollar leads to higher inflation.&quot;    If the dollar continues to slump, the Federal Reserve may feel obliged to raise short-term interest rates further in an effort to calm investor jitters about the inflation outlook, according to some traders. Earlier this month, the Fed increased its discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, to 6% from 5 1/2%, the first increase since April 1984.    But others contend that the Fed is unlikely to tighten credit any further because such a move could undermine the moderate economic expansion -- and possibly even trigger a recession. These analysts argue that Fed officials acted in the hope that a small dose of higher rates now will remove the need for more painful medicine next year during the presidential campaign.    Yesterday's sharp sell-off startled many traders and analysts. They said several government reports yesterday indicated that the economy has been growing at a moderate pace that shouldn't lead to overheating or bottlenecks. For example, the Commerce Department said that retail sales last month rose 1.3%, which was smaller than the 2% increase that many economists had expected.    &quot;There was no fundamental reason for the size of the decline&quot; in bond prices yesterday, said Raymond W. Stone, associate director of research at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Yesterday's bond decline was especially surprising because of the latest economic statistics, he said, adding: &quot;The psychology is just terrible. Every bit of information is read from the negative side.    &quot;At the moment, the market has gone too far, too fast, and therefore could stage a short-term rebound,&quot; Mr. Stone contended.    In the corporate bond market, prices fell as much as 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, on long-term issues, amid a flurry of new offerings. Among the largest were:    --A $250 million issue of Johnson andamp; Johnson notes due September 1992. Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. priced the 9 1/8% notes at 99.525 to yield 9.245%, or 0.3 percentage point more than the yield on the Treasury's five-year notes. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    --A $200 million issue of GTE Corp. sinking fund debentures due September 2017. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch priced the 10 3/4% debentures at 99.5 to yield 10.806%, or 1.21 percentage points over comparable Treasury bonds. The issue is rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    --A $150 million issue of Domtar Inc. debentures due September 2017. Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley priced the 11 1/4% debentures at 99.125 to yield 11.352%, or 1.7 percentage points over comparable Treasury bonds. The debentures are rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Xerox Credit Corp. notes due September 1992. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers priced the 9 1/2% notes at 99.844 to yield 9.54%, or 0.62 percentage point more than the Treasury's five-year notes. The issue is rated single-A-2 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    Several new state and local government bond issues also were offered to investors. Among these was about $52.3 million of New Mexico severance tax bonds.    The New Mexico issue was priced after an auction to yield from 4.75% on bonds due 1988 to 7% on those due 1997, according to Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., the underwriter. The bonds are rated double-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P. J. Douglas Casey, a managing director at Kidder, said the unsold balance as of late yesterday was about $20 million.    In the Treasury bond market, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell yesterday to a price of 92 2/32 from 93 22/32 Monday. The yield climbed to 9.69% from 9.51%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds dropped 17.46 points to 1179.23. It ranged between 1178.14 and 1194.60.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 slumped to 94 13/32 from 95 14/32, while the yield rose to 9.51% from 9.34%.    Rates rose on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month bills increased to 6.36% bid from an average of 6.32% at Monday's auction. The latest six-month bill rate rose to 6.70% bid from the auction average of 6.64%. </TEXT></DOC>
