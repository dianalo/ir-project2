Designed and developed by Monterey Peninsulaentrepreneurs, it is scheduled to open in the spring of 1992.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BIG SUR RESORT GETS UNDER WAYLAVISH SPA TO FEATURE CABINS WITH SOD ROOFS,TREE HOUSES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Shorter version ran P. 2B Morning Final Edition  </MEMO><TEXT>     The developers of the lavish resort, Michael Freed and Myles Williams, havespared no expense to design the hostelry -- and to involve people with a stakein the area, such as Tom Steinbeck, the son of author John Steinbeck, who grewup in the area, and Bill Post, a descendant of Big Sur pioneer WilliamBrainard Post, said people familiar with the project. The inn takes its namefrom the 100-acre Post Ranch, one of the earliest settlements on the Big Surcoast, owned by Bill Post and others. The ranch borders the inn property.;   Rigorous conditions OK'd;  Monterey County officials approved the resort plannearly a year ago, after the developers agreed to a set of rigorous conditionsdesigned to keep the inn unobtrusive and to improve life on the rigorouslycontrolled, pristine Big Sur coast.;    The development will not be visiblefrom the road, and guest vehicles will not be allowed on a ridge at the site.The resort will provide a shuttle service.;    &quot;There isn't a week when wedon't have a number of projects proposed to my office for Big Sur and most ofthem are completely unacceptable,&quot; said Monterey County Supervisor KarinStrasser Kauffman. &quot;Very few applicants are willing to work within our veryrigorous coastal plan, but these developers worked entirely within the rules.The project is entirely low key and small scale and that's the way it shouldbe.&quot;;    Fire station is promised;  Under terms of the county approval,developers will build a fire station for Big Sur's volunteer fire brigade,which has been without a home for years. Barbecue pits, a picnic area andhorseshoe and volleyball courts to be built next to the fire station will befor public use, as will four hiking trails along the coastline that developersare also required to build.;    All of that will allow Freed and Williams toput the resort they envisioned eight years ago into operation -- a resortwhere cabins equipped with mini-bars, stereo systems, fireplaces, VCR-equippedtelevisions and hot tubs will rent for between $350 and $700 per night.;   Designed by Big Sur architect Mickey Muennig, the Post Ranch Inn will includetwo lodges made of wood and stone housing a library devoted to Big Surhistory, original artworks by Big Sur artists and a health club and swimmingpools.;    But the most unusual aspect of the inn's design are the guestcabins, some recessed into the side of a ridge with sod roofs and some to bebuilt on stilts in the middle of a redwood grove. A book being written by TomSteinbeck on the history of the Post Ranch will be placed in every cabin.;   The inn will also include 20 units of employee housing -- a needed aspect ofany new resort in an area with few housing options.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ESTHER SCHRADER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910411  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  557  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday April 11, 199100102051,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
