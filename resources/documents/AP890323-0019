HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When a hospital computer catches a virus, theresults can be hazardous to patients' health, a doctor says.   In a letter in today's New England Journal of Medicine, aradiologist described what happened when computers used foranalyzing patients' nuclear scans were infected with two computerviruses.   Computer viruses are devious pieces of computer code that movefrom machine to machine, often reproduce themselves and sometimesmake computers sick.   Although this time the infection was cured without lasting harm,Dr. Jack E. Juni said potential damage was serious.   ``The information on these machines was the actual scans we wereusing to make diagnoses,'' he said in an interview. ``If the datahad been lost, it would have affected the diagnoses of patients.''   One of the viruses was relatively benign, making copies of itselfwhile leaving other information in the computer alone. However, theother virus inserted itself into programs and directories of patientinformation and made the machines malfunction.   Juni, of William Beaumont Hospitals in Royal Oak, Mich., saidabout three-quarters of the programs stored in two Macintosh IIpersonal computers were infected.   He said he did not know the origin of the less harmful virus, butthe more serious one apparently was on the hard disk of one of thecomputers when the hospital had bought it. A hard disk is theinternal device used by computers to store programs and data. Thevirus spread from one computer to another when a doctor used a wordprocessing program on both machines while writing a medical paper.   Juni said the virus caused occasional random malfunctions.Sometimes the computers would freeze up or garble patients' names.   The hospital had backup copies of patient records, and eventuallypurged the viruses from the computers. It has since institutedprecautions in an effort to keep out viruses.   Juni said the virus was on a hard disk manufactured by CMSEnhancements of Tustin, Calif.   CMS spokesman Ted James said a virus was inadvertently put on 600hard disks last October. The virus had contaminated a program usedto prepare the hard disks for use. It apparently got into thecompany's plant on a hard disk that had been returned for servicing.   James said that of the 600 virus-tainted disks, 200 were shippedt dealers, and four were sold to customers.   However, he said, the virus was ``as harmless as it's possible tobe.'' It inserted a small piece of extra computer code on hard disksbut did not reproduce or tamper with other material on the disk. Hesaid he did not think Juni's problems were caused by that virus.</TEXT></DOC>
