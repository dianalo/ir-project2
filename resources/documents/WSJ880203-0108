The Census Bureau said people aged 25 to 44 will constitute 44% of the U.S. voting-age population in November, up from 39% in 1980. This outsized age group of about 79 million people, which includes the postwar population bulge commonly called the Baby Boom, is an increasingly influential voting block, as Americans tend to vote more regularly as they get older.    The youngest eligible voters, those 18 to 24 years old, who now number 27 million, or 15% of the voting age population, traditionally have the lowest voter turnout of any group. This group will be four percentage points smaller in November than it was in the 1980 presidential elections, the Census Bureau said. The 45 to 64 age group has also shrunk slightly in the past eight years.    Meanwhile, the most reliable voters, the 31 million people 65 years and over, have grown one percentage point since 1980. This block of elderly persons now makes up 17% of eligible voters.    In the 1984 presidential election, roughly 54% of people old enough to vote cast ballots. </TEXT></DOC>
