<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-0320 </DOCNO><TEXT>Over the past years, the DOE Contractors have produced a great deal ofwork that has been extensively reviewed and criticized by the NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC), the Materials Review Board (MRB) of theDOE, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), and the technicalsupport group at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Common aspectsof the reviews and criticisms have provided information on the levelof evidence required by the scientific community to defend performanceclaims. Important indicators of the type of evidence that the NRC willrequire for favorable decisions of reasonable assurance also can be obtainedfrom 10 CFR 60 and its rationale, from NRC guides and Technical Positionpapers, from past reviews of the DOE programs by NRC Contractors, andfrom the use of reasonable assurance by the NRC in its 1984 Waste ConfidenceDecision. This report describes general concepts related to the acceptabilityand unacceptability of the level of evidence needed to defend claimswith reasonable assurance. The concepts were formulated on the basisof analyses of the NRC position papers, and of common aspects of thereviews and criticisms dealing with compliance demonstration.</TEXT></DOC>
