<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-56-1090 </DOCNO><TEXT>States up to I/sup {pi}/ = (20{sup +}) have been established in the neutron-deficient/sup 140/Gd nucleus by means of the /sup 92/Mo(/sup 50/Cr, 2p{gamma})reaction. At a rotational frequency (h/2{pi}){omega} = 0.30 MeV, theground-state band is crossed by a band built on the aligned [{pi}h/sub11/2/]{sup 2} two-quasiproton configuration. This proton-aligned bandwas observed from spins 10{sup +} to (20{sup +}). A second 10{sup +}state was established which is most likely built on the [{nu}h/sub 11/2/]{sup2} two-quasineutron configuration. The {gamma}-vibrational band was observedup to I/sup {pi}/ = (8{sup +}) with the odd- and even-spin members exhibitinga pronounced signature splitting. The results are compared to those foundrecently for the lighter /sup 136/Nd and /sup 138/Sm N = 76 isotones.</TEXT></DOC>
