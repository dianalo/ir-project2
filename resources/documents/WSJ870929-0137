Boesky's sentencing date has been postponed for a second time, to Dec. 18.    The arbitrager, who pleaded guilty April 23 to conspiring to make false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission, had been most recently scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 9 by U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker. The sentencing hearing was originally set for Aug. 21.    Such postponements are common for defendants such as Mr. Boesky, whose cooperation with the government is integral to other pending insider-trading cases. A spokeswoman for Judge Lasker said that both sides had agreed to the new date.    Mr. Boesky faces a maximum of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines for the SEC violation, which represents his total criminal liability in the insider-trading case. He also settled related civil SEC charges by giving up $100 million in assets. </TEXT></DOC>
