Subway President Kim Myong-nong ordered strikers to return towork by early Friday or face disciplinary action. Union officialsrefused.   Subway officials said about 6,000 of the system's 7,732 employeesparticipated in the strike, the first extended work stoppage in theSeoul Subway Corp.'s 15-year history. More than 2,300 strikers werearrested.   A sudden snowstorm that hit Seoul during the morning added tocongestion and confusion in city streets clogged with heavy traffic.   The 3 million people who use the subway daily in this city ofabout 10 million struggled to find alternate transportation. Buseswere packed with riders, and taxis carried up to five passengers.   Union leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity said they wouldstay on strike until their demands for Kim's resignation were metand all arrested strikers were released and charges dropped.   Union leaders accuse Kim of acting in bad faith during labornegotiations last week. The talks resulted in an agreement on newpay and working conditions, but strikers said they do not trust thesubway corporation to live up to the deal.   Strikers also demanded withdrawal of lawsuits against laborleaders who organized protests last week in which subway workersallowed commuters to ride free.   ``The strike will probably continue for a few days as police havedetained thousands of protesters and most union members are ready toresist the government's stern measures,'' one union official said.   About 4,000 riot police raided a subway depot in eastern Seoul todisperse 3,000 strikers who had seized the facility overnight anderected barricades. Armored trucks fired tear gas, and bulldozersremoved the barricades.   Some strikers hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, but theywere overpowered in less than 30 minutes. Police said 2,344 strikerswere arrested at the depot.   Police said most of those arrested would be released by Fridaybut that 30 would be charged with organizing an illegal strike.   The government mobilized more than 10,000 extra buses, trucks andcars to provide emergency service. Government workers wereinstructed to report to work one hour late and school pupils onehour early to help reduce traffic.   Limited service was provided on some subway lines by managers,non-striking workers and drivers drafted from the national railroadsystem, subway officials said.   The officials reported that the city's four subway lines operatedat 54 percent of their capacity.   Mayor Koh Kun apologized to commuters for the inconvenience. ``Wewant the strikers to return to work and drop their unjust demands,''he said.   The strikers have demanded that Koh sign the new labor agreement,but Koh said he could not do that because he did not represent thecorporation.   The only previous strike by subway workers was a two-hourstoppage in June 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
