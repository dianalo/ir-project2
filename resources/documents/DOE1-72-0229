This is demonstrated primarilyusing intersentential ellipsis resolution, in addition to examples ofdefinite reference resolution, in addition to examples of definite referenceresolution and interactive error correction. The system's conversationalcontext arises naturally as the result of the persistence of the internalrepresentations of previous utterances in working memory. Natural languageinput is interpreted within this framework using a modification of thesyntactic technique of chart parsing, extended to include semantics,and adapted to the production-system architecture. It provides a gracefulway of handling ambiguity within this architecture, and allows separateknowledge sources to interact smoothly across different utterances ina highly integrated fashion. The design of this system demonstrates howflexible and natural-user interactions can be carried out using a systemwith a naturally flexible control structure. A processing-based taxonomyfor ellipsis resolution developed is used to analyze the coverage ofintersentential ellipsis.</TEXT></DOC>
