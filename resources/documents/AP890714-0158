The Tax Court sided with Bunker Hunt and his wife, Caroline, on akey issue in a case involving millions of dollars worth of transfersthey made to cover their children's losses on investments in silver.   The court held that transfers of money made through March 14,1980, when silver prices were still rising, were loans that theHunts could write off as bad debts after the children were unable torepay them. Payments to the children after that date were gifts onwhich the Hunts must pay taxes, Judge Carolyn M. Parr ruled.   The judge held that the Hunts' children, to the extent they hadany net worth remaining at the end of 1980, are liable for incometaxes on the value of their forgiven debts to the parents.   In addition to the Hunts, the case involved son Houston Hunt;daughters Mary Huddleston and Elizabeth Curnes and sons-in-lawAlbert D. Huddleston and Thomas J. Curnes.   The Internal Revenue Service was seeking more than $1.75 millionin 1980 income tax and gift tax in the cases, the bulk of it fromthe elder Hunts. The court decision did not indicate how much thebrothers and their children would owe as a result of the ruling.   ``I'm not really as familiar with it as I'd like to be so I can'tcomment on it,'' Bunker Hunt said when asked about the ruling.   The trial of a separate case involving 1982 taxes and penaltiessought from Bunker and William Herbert Hunt is continuing in TaxCourt. The central issue is a partnership and the value of assetsthat the Hunts used to cover their debts when the silver marketplunged.   A Hunt cousin testified Friday that a precious-metals dealerthreatened to make the entire Hunt family suffer unless Bunker andWilliam Herbert repaid $434 million in debt from the March 27, 1980,silver price collapse.   Cousin Tom Hunt told of a meeting with Milton Rosenthal, thenchairman and president of New Jersey-based Engelhard Corp. threedays after the price plunge.   ``Mr. Rosenthal said the three individuals must pay or the restof the family must suffer,'' Tom Hunt told Judge Jules G. Korner IIIin a non-jury trial in which Bunker and Herbert are contesting about$300 million in 1982 taxes, while brother Lamar is contesting$500,000.   Tom Hunt said that Lamar, youngest of the three brothers, did notowe Engelhard.   He said he told Rosenthal that the brothers would be ready to gointo bankruptcy to protect the family's other assets.``Once he saidthe family must suffer ... I took it to mean every Hunt company,every Hunt, every individual had to share in payment,'' Hunt said.``I felt it was a threat.''   According to Bunker and Herbert's attorney, Michael Henke,Engelhard officials and the brothers met with a group of bankers inan unsuccessful effort to get a loan. Bunker and Herbert ultimatelysettled their Engelhard debt with silver and a 20 percent interestin their Beaufort Sea oil and gas interests.   To settle remaining silver debts, the family-owned Placid Oil Co.borrowed $1.1 billion and put $824 million of it into a partnershipwith the brothers. They added gold stocks and silver and coalproperties, which the government contends are worth far less thatthe Hunts' estimates.   The case decided by the court Friday indicated the net worth ofthe Hunt children was tied directly to the price of silver, in whichthey, with money from their parents, had heavily invested.   At the end of 1979, the combined net worth of the three children(a fourth was not involved in the case) and two spouses was $76million. In less than a month, at the silver peak, they were worth acombined $163 million. They were wiped out in the price collapse,chiefly because their investment was in contracts for futurepurchases, whose price fluctuations were limited.   In the first five months of 1980, Bunker and Caroline Hunttransferred more than $150 million to the children to help them makemargin calls in the silver market or to take delivery of silver.   Late in 1980, Bunker Hunt formally demanded that the childrenturn over all their assets except their homes to settle the debts.He wrote off as tax-deductible bad debt the portion of the loansexceeding the children's assets.</TEXT></DOC>
