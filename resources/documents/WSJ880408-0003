Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TXA NBCT GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><TEXT>   Two troubled Texas banking companies said they have initiated preliminary discussions about a merger that envisions assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Texas American Bancshares Inc., a Fort Worth-based bank holding company with $5.2 billion in assets, and National Bancshares Corp. of Texas, a San Antonio-based concern with about $2.8 billion in assets, said their goal is to create a concern with $8 billion in assets that would be able to raise new equity capital.    Both companies emphasized that the talks are highly preliminary and neither would say how they plan to restructure or recapitalize a combined company.    Intrastate bank mergers are all the rage in banking, but if recent history is a guide, merging two troubled Texas banking concerns may lead to an even bigger banking problem later. Last year, two Dallas banking institutions, RepublicBank Corp. and InterFirst Corp. combined to form First RepublicBank Corp. The idea was to become Texas' dominant banking corporation, achieve cost savings by eliminating duplication and generate capital through accounting adjustments.    The merger lacked geographic diversification in a state reeling from a recession, and only compounded loan losses. Nine months after First RepublicBank was born, it sought help from the FDIC for what may become the largest federal rescue in banking history.    Stanley Silverberg, a former FDIC research director, said the FDIC would probably be wary of approving such a merger in the wake of First RepublicBank's poor performance. Some critics have charged that regulators never should have approved the merger that forged the bank.    &quot;I think the FDIC will take a hard look&quot; at a Texas American merger with National, Mr. Silverberg said. He said the agency would have to assure itself that one of the banks -- presumably National -- would fail without help, and that no other bank or investor could be attracted to prop it up without FDIC assistance.    FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney declined comment, saying the agency hasn't received any formal request for help.    Some out-of-state banks might be interested in acquiring the San Antonio bank without help, in order to establish a foothold in Texas, Mr. Silverberg said.    As separate entities, both concerns have been running up a series of net losses since 1986, when oil prices plummeted and real estate values skidded in the Southwest. Texas American reported a narrowed $78 million loss last year, down from $115.2 million in 1986. Its nonperforming loans at Dec. 31 were $515 million, or 12.3% of all loans and foreclosed assets.    National reported a $33.4 million loss in 1987, more than triple its $10.8 million loss in 1986. Its nonperforming loans at yearend were $258.2 million, or 13.5% of total loans.    If the two banks move to seek FDIC assistance, it would bring to five the number of large Texas banking concerns that have decided to turn to the government to help survive the severe recession in Texas. The most recent was First RepublicBank's request for FDIC assistance last month. That move followed a $1.5 billion FDIC-assisted bailout of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas, which is still pending, and a $200 million federally assisted rescue of Dallas's BancTexas Group Inc. that was completed last year.    Both National and Texas American said that whatever new equity capital they managed to raise for a merged institution &quot;would significantly dilute the interests of existing shareholders.&quot; Even if the merger talks collapsed, and the two companies raised capital separately, both companies said shareholders are likely to suffer dilution of their investment.    Texas American capital has declined substantially because of loan losses, principally due to real estate loans that comprised nearly half its loan portfolio and 76% of its non-performing assets. Total shareholder equity was $248 million, or a slim 4.5% of average assets last year and some of its banking units are operating below minimum capital levels, with regulatory approval, the company said.    National's capital also has been sliding due to loan losses and amounted to $107.4 million, or 3.8% of assets at year end.    In terms of market share, both companies have strength where the other has weakness. Texas American doesn't have any banks in National's San Antonio hometown and National doesn't have any banks in Texas American's Fort Worth base. The only overlapping markets are Austin and Houston. National has 12 bank units, Texas American has 25.    ---   Robert E. Taylor in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
