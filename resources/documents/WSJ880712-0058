The glass and ceramics giant announced plans to place its substantial television-bulb-glass manufacturing operations into a partnership with Asahi Glass Co. Corning will manage the venture, initially owning 67% of it, and the Japanese glass and chemical maker will pay Corning to link up with Corning's $250 million-a-year business. The payment amount wasn't disclosed.    The arrangement will give Corning broader access to the growing world-wide computer and television market as well as to Japanese manufacturers, many of which are expanding their production facilities to the U.S.    The partnership is just the latest in a long string of alliances that has made Corning the most active -- and most successful -- joint-venture participant. The 137-year-old company has started 38 of them in a dozen countries since 1924, and only six of them have failed. Corning Glass's profit from ventures grew 30% last year to $98 million, or more than half its total operating income of $189 million.    &quot;Corning is one of the few companies that's figured out how to use joint ventures to its advantage,&quot; contends Kathryn Rudie Harrigan, a professor at Columbia University's business school. She found in a study that the average success rate for joint ventures is only 46% and the average life span is just 3.5 years. In contrast, half of Corning's ventures have existed for at least 10 years.    What accounts for Corning's success? Its unpretentious -- almost humble -- corporate culture is one major factor. So is its strategy of giving the ventures vast autonomy. Chairman James Houghton's mild, diplomatic approach to partnerships infuses in managers the ability to cope with the constant compromise and give-and-take that successful joint ventures require. And rather than pride and ego -- Corning's name, for example, nearly always appears last on the venture -- Mr. Houghton lists trust and the ability to share as key elements that make an alliance work.    &quot;If the partners continually have to look over each other's shoulder, then the offspring venture will have little chance of surviving,&quot; contends the 51-year-old Mr. Houghton, the fifth generation of his family to run Corning. His great-great-grandfather founded the company in 1851.    Corning's latest venture with Asahi reflects the push by numerous U.S. companies to penetrate foreign markets and gain instant access to emerging technology. To build a new business, such ventures often are cheaper and faster than starting one from scratch or acquiring a company.    Asahi, the world's largest maker of glass bulbs, will supply the new company, Corning Asahi Video Products, with the technology to produce large-sized and advanced high-resolution glass bulbs for TVs and computer terminals, among other things. Eventually, Asahi will own 49% of the company.    And even some of Corning's own venture partners question a corporate culture that gives up so much. &quot;Unless we're in control, we aren't comfortable,&quot; says Frank Breeze, vice chairman of Pittsburgh-based PPG Industries Inc., which has two successful ventures with Corning. &quot;What Corning does that others can't do is sit back and let someone else be in the driver's seat.&quot;    Nevertheless, Mr. Houghton insists that many of its ventures have helped transform Corning's old-line manufacturing base into a modern conglomerate with strong growth potential. In addition, its alliances with Asahi and other foreign companies, such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Corp. and West Germany's Siemens AG, have been politically advantageous as Corning expands into Europe, South America and Asia.    &quot;The world has become too complicated&quot; for companies to enter new markets and form new businesses on their own, says Mr. Houghton. Consequently, joint ventures have become &quot;a form of leverage,&quot; he says.    That helps explain why &quot;there's a certain amount of desperation right now to find compatible partners,&quot; asserts Ms. Harrigan. She predicts that within a decade, &quot;most companies will be members of teams that compete against other teams.&quot; Companies that go it alone &quot;will find themselves on the bottom rung of an emerging two-tier system,&quot; she adds.    Although joint ventures are new to many companies, Corning has been forming them since 1880, when the fledgling maker of decorative glass and dinnerware helped Thomas Edison develop the light bulb. Corning no longer makes light bulbs, but some other familiar ventures became models for joint-venture success. Dow Corning, with Dow Chemical Co. as partner, became the leading producer of silicone, while Owens-Corning Fiberglas, with Owens-Illinois Corp., grew into the nation's largest maker of glass fiber. For consumers, Corning is best known for fine Steuben crystal and its popular Pyrex, Corning and Corelle brands of housewares. By the early 1980s, with many of its markets maturing and profit sagging, Corning took on a new life. It shed unprofitable units, sold its light-bulb business, shrank its work force and established a new crop of joint ventures with leading domestic and foreign biotechnology, medical-diagnostic and communications companies.    The moves radically changed its shape and direction, helping Corning survive the wrenching retrenchment without the major disruptions that have shaken thousands of major U.S. companies in recent years.    But Corning's ventures sometimes flop, and when they do it often reflects a failure to adhere to the company's own five rules: seek a compatible partner, make it a 50-50 partnership, set the venture apart from both parents, agree on long-term goals, and select a strong management team. Instead, Corning occasionally rushes into a deal only to find its partner's management style, objectives and motivations at odds with its own.    That's what happened to an ill-fated venture in Indonesia to make dinnerware. While government red-tape and a weakened economy hurt the venture, Corning's clashes with Kedaung Group Ltd. ultimately proved fatal. Its partner's loyalty to Corning receded after discovering it more profitable to produce and sell a similar product on its own. &quot;We had different objectives,&quot; says Robert Turissini, president of Corning Latin America/Asia Pacific Inc., who finally concluded in 1983 after five years that &quot;it wasn't going to work.&quot;    Still, things can go awry even when corporate cultures match and the venture is well-managed. After spending nearly $10 million to form Nutrisearch International Corp., Corning and partners Kroger Co. and Eastman Kodak Co. decided it would be too costly to make commercial foods from dairy byproducts using enzyme and fermentation technology.    &quot;All the dynamics were right. We liked each other and we worked well together. The technology never worked the way we thought it would,&quot; says E. Martin Gibson, president of Corning's health and science group. Still, he adds, &quot;if markets change, we'd try it again.&quot;    Corning's more-numerous successes in these often-risky marriages reflect careful prenuptial planning and a sometimes lengthy courtship. It took two years before Corning and Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy Ltd. agreed to form Ciba-Corning Diagnostics Corp., a concern to develop a new generation of blood and urine analyzers.    Ciba-Geigy, the world's second-largest pharmaceutical maker, possessed a highly regarded laboratory, and Corning had what Ciba needed: a foothold in the emerging medical-diagnostics business with a $150 million-a-year business and a 400-member marketing team.    The mating game was slow. &quot;Ciba didn't believe in joint ventures. They wanted to buy us out so they could have 100% of our business,&quot; recalls Mr. Gibson. Not until the affable Mr. Houghton, who is fluent in French and once lived in Switzerland, flew to that country to face reluctant Ciba Chairman Albert Bodmer did the stalemate end.    &quot;Jamie didn't go in as a Wall Street dealmaker or a Texas gunslinger. He didn't fit any of the Swiss stereotypes about American businessmen,&quot; says Mr. Gibson. Within days, the Swiss concern agreed to ante up $100 million for half of Corning's medical business and the joint venture was formed.    Still, getting a venture off the ground can prove surprisingly simple compared with assuring its success. Often the largest challenge is convincing corporate managers and researchers from two diverse cultures to cooperate. Frequently, workers remain loyal to their former parent instead of the new alliance and that can prove divisive.    Consider the early travails of Genencor Inc., Corning's six-year-old venture with San Francisco-based Genentech Inc. Initially, it seemed the perfect pairing of two research-driven companies pooling their strengths to enter the potentially lucrative industrial-enzymes market.    But in its zeal to start quickly, the venture mistakenly permitted staff members to retain their jobs with each parent while on assignment to Genencor. Rivalries developed. Employees tagged Corning's New York staff &quot;Genencor East&quot; while Genentech's California employees were known as &quot;Genencor West.&quot; By 1984, two years after it began, the company still hadn't developed a product or strategy.    Corning's solution: it persuaded Genentech to require all Genencor employees to resign from their parent company. &quot;Suddenly, things started popping,&quot; he adds, as the employees realized their careers hinged on the venture prospering. In 1987, Kodak joined the venture.    Corning says it expects sales and earnings growth for both the Ciba Corning and Genencor ventures as new products achieve market success.    ---                 Major Corning Glass Ventures VENTURE                    PARTNER                   YEAR Pittsburgh Corning         PPG Industries            1937 Owens-Corning              Owens-Illinois            1938 Dow Corning                Dow Chemical              1943 Iwaki Glass                Asahi Glass               1965 Samsung-Corning            Samsung                   1974 Siecor                     Siemens                   1977 Genencor                   Genentech, Eastman Kodak  1982 Ciba Corning Diagnostics   Ciba-Geigy                1985 Corning Asahi Video Prod.
