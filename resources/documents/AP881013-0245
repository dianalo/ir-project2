Q: Mr. Vice President, Governor. Mr. Vice President, let mereturn for a moment to the issue of the budget, because so much hasalready been put off limits in your campaign that most people donot believe that the flexible freeze alone will solve the problemof the deficit. So, let's turn to defense for a moment.   Pentagon officials tell us that there is not enough money in thebudget to handle military readiness, preparedness, as well as newweapons systems that have been proposed, as well as those alreadyin the pipeline. You were asked at the first debate what newweapons systems you would cut. You mentioned three that had alreadybeen canceled. Can you, tonight, share with us three new weaponssystems that you would cut?   Bush: If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought werepurely waste, and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn'tbe in the budget. They would not be in the budget. But you want onenow? I'll give you one. That HEMAT, that heavy truck, that's cost,what is it, $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and yeta member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.   I think we can save money through this whole, very sophisticatedconcept, Andrea, that I know you do understand, of competitivestrategies. It is new. And it is very, very different than what'shappened. But, it's not quite ready to be totally implemented. But,it's very important. I think we can save through the PackardCommission report, and I'm very proud that David Packard, theoriginator of that report, is strongly supporting me. So, it's nota question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste. I don'tbelieve that.   I do think this: we're in the serious stages of negotiation withthe Soviet Union now on the strategic arms control talks. And weare protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing ourstrategic forces. My secretary of defense is going to have to makea very difficult decision in which system to go forward with. But,we are protecting both of them. We're moving forward withnegotiations. And, you see, I just think it would be dumbnegotiating policy with the Soviets, to cut out one or the other ofthe two options right now. The Soviets are modernizing. Theycontinue to modernize. And we can't simply say, ``We've got enoughnuclear weapons. Let's freeze.'' We can't do that.   We have to have modernization. Especially if we achieve the 50percent reduction in strategic weapons that our president is takingthe leadership to attain. And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it.And I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possibleif we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies, andif we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.   Q: Governor Dukakis, one minute.   Dukakis: Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why theVice President's mathematics just doesn't add up. I think you know,because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that wecan build all of the weapons systems that the vice president sayshe wants to build within the existing defense budget. Everybodyknows that, including the people at the Pentagon.   Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with someof those decisions, but it's going to be the president that's goingto have to ultimately decide, before that budget goes to theCongress, what weapon systems are going to go and what are going tostay. We're not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr.Bush wants to spend on Star Wars. We're not going to spend billionson MXs on railroad cars, which is a weapon system we don't need,can't afford, and won't help our defense posture at all. We're notgoing to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane fromWashington to Tokyo.   Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make. Yes,we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nucleardeterrent. We're going to go forward with the Stealth, the D-5 andthe advanced cruise missile and good conventional forces. But thenext president of the United States will have to make some toughand difficult decisions. I'm prepared to make them ...   Q: Governor.   Dukakis: ... the Vice President is not.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
