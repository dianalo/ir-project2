Talk of more talks was put on hold while, with Bush heading forJapan, Congress began budget hearings amid efforts to extract moredetailed information from the White House.   ``We've got an administration here that wants to embrace theconcept of a line-item veto but won't give us a line-item budget,''said Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate BudgetCommittee.   The president met at the White House early Tuesday with Sasser,Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; House Speaker JimWright, D-Texas, and other top Republicans and Democrats fromCapitol Hill.   It was the first such meeting since Bush revealed his $1.16trillion fiscal 1990 budget in a speech to Congress on Feb. 9.   Lawmakers said they told the president that before negotiationscould begin they needed more detail, especially on how he would payfor the new programs he wants for education, the environment, childcare and other areas.   And they said the prognosis was poor for some of the specificrecommendations he did include _ such as a reduction in the capitalgains tax rate.   Bush contends cutting the rate about in half, to 15 percent,would result in more taxes being paid because economic activitywould increase. Democrats not only doubt the president's supply-sidemath but contend the tax is a giveaway to the rich, since poorpeople have few capital gains.   The meeting was polite but it dealt more with schedules thansubstance, participants said.   ``The symbolism is very good. We haven't really gotten down tosubstance,'' Wright said, predicting that once work begins, ``someserious differences will emerge'' on issues such as a $5 billionMedicare cut, one of the handful of spending cuts Bush did detail.   ``It was important for us to emphasize we're on the right track.And we are,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., the House BudgetCommittee chairman. But, Panetta asked, ``When does he start to makethe tough choices? That's part of the process here, to find out whatthe choices are.''   Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, appearing before theSenate Budget Committee, defended the White House budget includingBush's proposal for a ``flexible freeze'' on $136 billion inexisting programs.   Those programs, mostly in domestic agencies, would be kept atlast year's spending levels with selected increases allowed only ifoffsetting cuts were made. The White House has refused to say whereit would cut and where it would support increases.   Going into further detail now had little appeal for theadministration, he said, since the chances were ``close to zero''that Congress would agree with the administration's policy choices.   ``We look forward to learning of other proposals and todiscussing them on the merits,'' Darman said. ``We mean to becooperative.'' Darman said all of the budget, not just the flexiblefreeze, was negotiable.   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., told him ``You get an `A' formood.'' But while that's important in Congress, he said agreeing ona budget is ``going to take more than a good mood.''   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said he thought the White Housewas trying to take political advantage and get Congress to join inon putting something over on the public.   ``We can't find it, can't catch it, and you say come on over tothe White House and we'll let you in on it,'' he told Darman, whomhe described as ``more Jack be nimble'' than David Stockman, formerPresident Reagan's budget director.   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., the senior Republican on thebudget committee, said he disagreed with the Democrats on the needfor fine detail.   ``I don't think we have to know the details but rather an overallview,'' he said. However, he told Darman it was wrong to use theword ``freeze'' for both Pentagon spending, which would increasewith inflation, and domestic programs that would be stuck at lastyear's spending levels.   At another hearing, before a House Appropriations subcommittee,Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said he did not know how muchmoney Bush is proposing for his department's fiscal 1990 budget.There will be no set number until after the budget negotiations withCongress, he said.   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said failure to suggest ways to pay for$441 million in new education programs sought by Bush cast doubtover the seriousness of the proposals.   ``It is certainly legitimate to question whether ... those are infact real initiatives or public relations initiatives which mightbecome real at a later date,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
