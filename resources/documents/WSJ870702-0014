After much watering down and countless compromises, the EC plan, 2 1/2 years in the making, had by last week received the assent of 11 of the 12 EC states. But Spain withheld its approval -- thus blocking the measures' adoption -- over the inclusion in the plan of the Gibraltar airport.    Spain, which doesn't agree with British sovereignty over Gibraltar, wants to settle the status of the colony's airport in bilateral talks with Britain. It said that including Gibraltar in the deregulation plan would prejudice its centurie-sold claim to the colony.    The EC Commission, the executive body that initially proposed the modest steps to bring lower prices and more competition into Europe's heavily regulated skies, said it was &quot;strongly disappointed&quot; by the failure of the measures to be adopted.    The commission, which has been attempting to crack down on airlines' allegedly anticompetitive practices, had set Tuesday as the deadline for passage of an agreement. In the absence of an accord, it wasn't clear yesterday whether the commission would follow up its threat of legal action against nine large airlines. The commission must now decide whether to revive the compromise package or to draw up selected new proposals, especially in the sensitive area of new market access for regional airlines. </TEXT></DOC>
