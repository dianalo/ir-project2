The Supreme Soviet, or legislature, in the republic ofByelorussia on Friday tentatively approved legislation that callsfor resettling 11,000 people during the next five years, the Sovietnews agency said.   ``Special attention will be paid to children from areas affectedby Chernobyl fallout,'' Tass said.   But during the debate, delegates to the national Congress ofPeople's Deputies attending the session and scientists fromByelorussia proposed more sweeping measures _ including theevacuation of 106,000 people, Tass said Saturday.   The April 26, 1986, accident at the No. 4 reactor of thefour-unit nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine killed twoworkers immediately in the world's worst atomic accident. Hundredswere hospitalized, including 31 who later died fromradiation-related injuries.   The accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts ofnorthern and central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs fromseveral countries. More than 130,000 people were evacauted afterthe accident.   The plant is 80 miles north of the Ukraine capital of Kiev.Byelorussia is north of the Ukraine and was in the main path of thefallout from the accident.   The government evacuation program for Byelorussia is based onpeople who are at risk of being exposed to 35 rems during alifetime. A rem is the standard unit of measurement for the amountof radiation absorbed by living tissue.   Thirty-five rems is 35,000 millirems. The typical diagnosticchest X-ray involves between 20 millirems and 30 millirems ofradiation.   The legislators and scientists recommended that normal livingconditions be made the criteria rather than a ceiling on thecumulative number of rems.   ``The most controversy was caused by the list of villages whoseresidents need to be resettled to radioactive-free territories,''Tass said.   Tass said they realized that, at a cost of $15.6 billion, theirproposals could not be realistically handled by the republic'sbudget. But, Tass said, ``they feel that Chernobyl is a disaster ofthe whole country, so the whole country must participate in curingthe wounds.''   However, the original proposal to resettle 11,000 was adopted onthe first reading and a standing commission was given theassignment of reviewing it and submitting it to the Byelorussianpeople for discussion, Tass said.   The proposed evacuation includes 12 districts with more than 500villages, in the Gomel and Mogilev regions, about 100 milesnorthest of the Chernobyl disaster site.</TEXT></DOC>
