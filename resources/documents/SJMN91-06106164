This ismy day to copy things.&quot;;    &quot;What does that mean?&quot; I asked.;    &quot;It means I goto the supermarket with a pocket full of change and use the copying machine torun off extras of all my records to send to people.&quot;;    &quot;Do you have any ideawhat you are doing?&quot; I asked.;    &quot;Not a clue,&quot; she said.;    One day Idropped by and she was sitting in the kitchen surrounded by boxes, ledgers andenvelopes, with the phone in the middle of the table.;    &quot;I cannot believeyou are just sitting here,&quot; I observed. &quot;Does that mean you're finished withthis mess?&quot;;    &quot;Are you crazy?&quot; she asked. &quot;I'm waiting for a call fromMedicare, another from Social Security, and one from an insurance company thatpays only 60 percent because he was an outpatient. I have to file with anotherinsurance company for the ambulance, another for the oxygen and another forthe medication. I'm looking into a bill from a doctor I have never heard ofwho sent me a statement for 'consultation.' I am also waiting for a new batchof death certificates to come in from the funeral director. It would have beeneasier and cheaper to invite them all to the funeral.&quot;;    At a time of herlife when my mother should be sitting around watching &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; andplaying with a pasta machine, she has been swept up in a current of decisions,from a funeral director wanting to know if she wants acknowledgment cards withan embossed cross or a rose, to a service station attendant asking what weightof oil she wants in the car.;    Claim filing is a lot like motherhood. It's acareer for which there is no training, no job description, no handbooks and noend in sight.;    When my mother called recently and informed us she was goingin for gall bladder surgery, she moaned, &quot;I don't mind the operation as muchas I dread getting into all those insurance forms again.&quot;;    I told her tolook upon it as a &quot;career enrichment&quot; experience.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Erma Bombeck column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910415  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  446  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 15, 199100106164,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
