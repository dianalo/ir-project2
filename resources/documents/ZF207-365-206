(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Comdex Spring '89: Trends blow through the Windy CityandM;THIS YEAR COMDEX Spring moved to Chicago, home of the Commodities Exchange.andO;Perhaps it was the locale, or perhaps it is indicative of the state of theIBM PC compatibles industry, but more than one booth resembled the tradingpit at the Exchange, with &quot;traders&quot; pulling out all the stops, buying andselling long and short the systems, subsystems and components that havehelped fuel the PC boom, laying the groundwork for what end users (almostforgotten in a show that is increasingly returning to its roots as a dealerand VAR event) will be offered over the next year.andM;The comparison with the &quot;pit&quot; is particularly apropos because of where the PCand compatibles industry finds itself eight years after IBM started it allwith its first floppy-only, 16-KB, 4.77-MHz, 8088-based PC.andP;  Comdex Spring isthe &quot;poor cousin&quot; to the Comdex Fall event, which is arguably the largestcomputer show in the world.andP;  The spring show is often skipped by &quot;major&quot;software and computer suppliers (Microsoft, Novell, 3Com and Lotus, amongothers, all gave it a miss).andP;  However, it is still a necessary pilgrimage formost  computer and all hardware subassembly and component suppliers, as wellas for the second- and third-tier networking and application softwarevendors.andM;Commodity componentsandM;Going from booth to booth chock-a-block with 80286 and 80386 motherboardsuppliers, VLSI chip-set vendors, BIOS developers, high-performance disksubsystem manufacturers, VGA cloners, monitor mavens, etc., it becomesapparent why the PC industry has achieved the market momentum it has.andM;Today VARs, dealers and even large customers can custom-select the componentparts of their PCs from a wealth of third-party suppliers with nearly totalconfidence that the  resulting machine will not only deliver the performanceexpected of it, but also be 100% compatible with all existing MS-DOS, OS/2,and Unix/Xenix applications.andP;  The PC market has reached the point where everycomponent is a virtual commodity.andP;  We were astounded recently to discoverthat we could use the same Award BIOS ROM set in our AST Premium 286, ourPC's Limited 286, and a custom-built machine that uses a Taiwanese clonemotherboard.andP;  This is possible because the motherboards of all three machinesuse the same Chips andamp; Technology AT chipset, consisting of 5-6 VLSI chips thatreplace the functions of more than 50 chips on the original IBM ATmotherboard.andM;By the same token, Apple's fierce deense of its BIOS explains why Macdex, theInterface Group's first attempt to clone its success into the Macmarketplace, was an utter failure, with fewer than 30 companies beingrelegated to a ghetto in the far corner of one of the three show halls (seepage 26).andM;VAR cooperative.andP;  The homogenization of the PC standard has reached the pointwhere some VARs have reduced their buying criteria to price alone.andP;  Thesewere the guys who previously bought machines from a handful of &quot;name&quot;suppliers, such as IBM, Compaq, AST, Leading Edge and Wyse, to give theircustomers warm and fuzzy feelings about &quot;reliability,&quot; &quot;compatibility,&quot;&quot;performance&quot; and the like.andM;No longer.andP;  Increasingly, the savvy buyer realizes that for manyapplications, any PC of the specified rating will do the job more or lessequally well.andP;  (If you want to be 100% convinced of IBM compatibility, buy anIBM or a Compaq.)andM;We met one such fellow who had previously used Leading Edge machines in thesmall-workgroup accounting and business systems that he assembled forclients.andP;  Leading Edge went bust, so at Comdex he was shopping for areplacement.andP;  Looking at the plethora of choices available, he and a group ofother VARs decided to band together to form a kind of &quot;VAR's cooperative&quot; tobuy PC components from which they will build their own PCs!andM;This makes a lot of sense.andP;  Some of the best PCs available today are actuallyhighly regarded PC motherboards from companies suchas AMI, Micronics, Mylexand Hauppauge.andP;  Power supplies and chassis can be bought from other reputablevendors, and graphic boards, floppy disk drives, and hard disk options areavailable at almost fire-sale prices as the vendors in these supply segmentsslug it out for market share.andP;  With 12-MHz 80286-based motherboards availabefor less than $ 200 from many sources, the cost savings of &quot;rolling your own&quot;are obvious.andM;Stuck on a sandbar.andP;  The commodity-like nature of today's PC compatiblesbusiness is largely responsible for making the PC the dominant desktopplatform.andP;  PC hardware vendors and application developers can take advantagepf economies of scale that Macintosh and Inix vendors can only dream about.andO;There is a down side to this phenomenon: because of the incredible investmentin existing architectures and applications, it will be proportionally moredifficult for PC vendors and users to migrate from their existingconfiguration suite to the &quot;next generation&quot;--whatever that is.andM;This helps to explain IBM's difficulty in getting the market to convert tothe PS/2 standard--or attracting Os/2 ISVs or users.andP;  At our March SeyboldSeminars, Dave Liddle, CEO of Metaphor, characterized the market as being&quot;stranded on a sandbar&quot; where innovation and progress are arrested by theweight of the enormous installed base of existing applications.andM;The VAR mentioned above clearly indicated that his customers don't need 80386or i486 (announced at the show) microprocessors or OS/2--or VGA graphics, forthat matter.andP;  (They do appreciate the speed boost provided by AT clones,however, which means that the 808X is really dead.)andP;  Yet much of IBM's andMicrosoft's promotion of PS/2s and OS/2 has focused on todayhs applications.andO;We believe both companies' efforts would be better targeted at robust,industrial-strength applications for which the existing MS-DOS, PC-bussolutions were compromises at best.andP;  Several such applications that come tomind are CAD, software development, network servers--and publishing.andP;  (Fromrecent conversations with both parties, we believe that they are finallygetting the message.)andM;It is difficult to anticipate where the truly original applications of thefuture will come from, particularly those capable of attracting new users tocomputing.andP;  We suspect that they will originate at a grass roots level,thanks to the introduction of object-orineted programming and/or hypertexttools, using multimedia to convey information aurally and visually as well ascognitively.andP;  Whatever the catalyst, don't expect to find these applicationsfirst at Comdex.andP;  As the premier dealer's show, Comdex will be highlightingmore and better of the same PC computing paradigm for some time to come.andO;Comdex serves not only as a marketplace of the wares available (and indemand) today, but also as a sounding board for new technologies and productsjust around the corner.andP;  Consequently it is a good place to feel the pulse ofthe industry to determine where we are today and where we are going.andM;As always, the technology trends in evidence at the show made our three daysin an unseasonably chilly Chicago well worthwhile.andM;A 32-bit futureandM;First, it was evident from strolling down the aisles that as far asmanufacturers are concerned, the world will be moving decidedly onto 80286and 80386 platforms soon.andP;  In January, Microsoft indicated that last year thesales of 80X86 machines exceeded those of 808X machines for the first time.andO;This was reflected in spades by what we saw at Comdex.andP;  For the first time,we were hard pressed to find any 808X machines on the show floor.andP;  Even thepercentage of 80286-based machines appeared to be in decline, as 80386 or386sx machines took the lead for the first time.andM;The emphasis on the 80386 was heightened by Intel's announcement of a 33-MHzpart.andP;  However, the move to the 386 is inevitable given the benefits to begained from that chip's performance, its paged-memory model, its ability torun multiple DOS sessions in virtual 8086 mode, and so on.andP;  Comdex merelyconfirmed that the inexorable march toward 32 bits is well underway.andM;Similarly, VGA is now the de facto base-line video standard.andP;  Few EGA boardswere shown, and Hercules is history.andM;No EISA bus machines were announced, and only a handful of new Micro ChannelArchitecture (MCA) machines were shown.andP;  One of these was a protable from anew startup, Mission Cyrus, whose high-concept packaging seems to indicatethat Steve Jobs' Next cube has raised the market's packaging consciousness aswell as upped the operating environment ante.andM;MCA fared better on the third-party add-on front as IBM went out of its wayto promote its beleaguered bus standard.andP;  IBM announced that more than 300companies have announced MCA cards, with 12 of them being bus-master cardsthat show off MCA's abilities at their best.andP;  Two MCA busmaster cardsannounced at the show were the $995 SuperFax board from Pacific Imaging,which supports concurrent fax transceiving, scanning, and printing; and a$595 Ethernet controller card, the 4110-3 Control Card, from BICC DataNetworks.andP;  Both products are also significant for appearing at a much lowerprice than many analysts had predicted for MCA bus-master cards.andM;OS/2 updateandM;Last spring, Byte magazine began to poll Comdex showgoers about whichoperating system would be dominant in the personal computer industry by theend of 1992.andP;  That spring's poll gave OS-2 a 32% vote, but by last fall gravedoubgs had begun to surface, and its share was down to h alf that figure.andO;This spring, OS/2 began a comeback in the public eye; 20% of the polledComdex attendees voted for its dominance at the end of 1992.andM;Although no one ever doubted that IBM and Microsoft were committed to OS/2,we are impressed by the seriousness of their current efforts.andP;  An old sayingteels us, &quot;You've got to go along to get along&quot;--or, in more picturesqueterms, &quot;If you want to make an omelette, you have to break some eggs.&quot;andP;  IfIBM is willing to sacrifice principles such as its us-against-them stand--forexample, by not only helping other hardware vendors develop drivers, but evendistributing them (see page 14)--then we wouldn't bet against OS/2'slong-range success.andM;As we've noted at the past two or three Comdexes, IBM in its booth playedhost, Apple style, to a number of PS/2 and OS/2 developers.andP;  Most notable forour readers were the OS/2 Presentation Manager versions of Zsoft's PCPaintbrush (see page 26) and Aldus PageMaker 3.0, both of which had been seenbefore, and--surprise, surprise--Ventura Publisher (our first impressions ofwhich are included later in this coverage).andP;  We also saw the new offeringfrom Lennane Advanced Products, DeScribe Word Publisher, which is targeted atthe professional publishing market (see The Seybold Report on PublishingSystems, Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  11, p. 30).andM;For its part, IBM said that it has joined the Windows Presentation ManagerAssociation (WPMA).andP;  WPMA was formed by eleven companies last August to&quot;address the unique challenges and opportunities of developing software inthe Windows and Presentation Manager environments.&quot;andP;  By joining the WPMA, IBMboth blesses it and gives further indication of the &quot;just one of the guys&quot;attitude projected by the company in the Cannavino era.andM;In general, the OS/2 developers with whom we talked said that they could seebenefits to running under the operating system.andP;  Both the increasedaddressable memory and the ability to divide up the application amongmultiple concurrently executing &quot;threads,&quot; or tasks, were cited in the &quot;plus&quot;column.andP;  OS/2 was also described as &quot;a real operating system,&quot; with superiordevelopment and debugging tools to those available under MS-DOS.andM;The negatives clustered around the difficulty of porting from Windows or DOSto OS/2 Presentation Manager (although Ventura's John Meyer claimed that itsport from GEM took less than six months from start to finish).andP;  Moreover,several developers said that too many of the dialog boxes and userinteractions were &quot;confusing&quot; and &quot;not elegantly coded.&quot;andP;  Worst from apublishing viewpoint, however, is the lack of font-scaling capabilitieswithin Presentation Manager's GPI imaging model and of efficient PCL andPostScript output drivers (both are currently under development byMicrosoft).andM;We will explore benefits and drawbacks of OS/2 Presentation Manager in moredepth in an article on Microsoft that will appear in an upcoming issue ofthis publication.andM;Other technologiesandM;Aside from confirming the establishment of several trends that had had theirfirst showings at previous Comdex events, this Comdex had its share of new orcutting-edge technologies.andP;  Today's &quot;technology demonstrations&quot; aretomorrow's standards, so one key job of any Comdex watcher is to ferret themout.andP;  Here is our list of new technologies we expect to find in tomorrow'scomputers.andM;4- and 16-MBit DRAMs.andP;  Both Toshiba and IBM demonstrated multiple-megabitdynamic RAM chip implementations at Comdex.andP;  Toshiba showed what it describedas the first commercial application using 4-MBit DRAMs--an 8-MB memory moduelfor the company's 80383-based T5200 portable computer that expands themachine's memory capacity to 14 MB.andM;For its part, IBM gave a technology demonstration of a PS/2 memory boardprototype that incorporated IBM's 16-MBit DRAMs.andP;  No availability date forthe technology or the board was provided.andM;Of the two announcements, Toshiba's is the more significant, since itsproduct is available today and will be made available to other memory boardmanufacturers.andP;  IBM develops memory chips only for its own use.andM;Color and hi-res LCD displays.andP;  Zenith demonstrated a 6-1/2&quot; color LCD with640 X 200 resolution.andP;  Toshiba showed an  11&quot; color LCD prototype for itsT5200 portable that has full VGA compatibility.andP;  It can display 16 colorswith 640 X 480 resolution.andP;  Toshiba also demonstrated a 14&quot; standalone colorLCD using active matrix technology with 720 X 550 dot resolution.andM;Hitachi, on the other hand, showed four different LCDs, three monochrome andone color.andP;  The monochrome models employs cold-cathode fluorescent technologyand display 1024 X 768, 720 X 527, and 640 X 480 resolutions, respectively.andO;The color model uses thin-film transistor technology and sports a 640 X 600resolution.andM;Erasable optical discs.andP;  The emerging optical technologies have been wellcovered in the popular press during the past year thanks in large part toNext's use of a Canon erasable optical drive in its magnesium black box.andP;  OurComdex Spring coverage last year (see Vol.andP;  2, No.andP;  10) highlighted thetechnology and the major players.andM;At this year's Comdex, optical technology--particulary WORM and erasabledrives--appeared to have moved out of the labs and onto the retail pricelists.andP;  However, the high prices of these components, plus the lack of asingle erasable disk standard (although the ISO data interchange draftstandard on the subject appears to be garnering increasing support), willprevent them from gaining wide acceptance in the near term.andM;Sharp showed a 5-1/2&quot; 600-MB erasable drive with a SCSI interface that willbe available to developers for less than $2,000.andP;  A new Hitachi 5-1/4&quot;erasable with a SCSI interface, the OD112-1, has 644 MB of data capacity anda 75-ms average seek time.andP;  Samples are available for $5,000.andP;  Two jukeboxversions containing 24 and 48 optical disc cartridges will also be available,the latter for $28,000 (no price for the 24-disc model was provided).andM;Handheld computers.andP;  Handheld computers have existed for several years.andO;Until recently, however, they found their way into few useful applicationsbecause of their restricted functionality and their incompatibility withdesktop standards.andM;There has been renewed interest in the concept of late as a new generation ofMS-DOS compatible machines has begun to appear.andP;  We saw one such machine atComdex--the PC/4000 from MicroPalm Computers.andP;  The $2,995 machine is slightlylarger than a hnad-held cellular phone and contains a full alphanumerickeyboard.andP;  It contains an 80C88 CPU running at 4 MHz--which makes it quitepossibly the slowest PC clone ever built--and runs MS-DOS 2.25, a versionspecially modified for the application.andM;Both system memory and mass storage are is in the form of CMOS memorymodules, with maximum of 704 KB for applications and 2 MB that functions asvirtual disk memory.andP;  The display is a 10 character by 8 line LCD with 120 X64 pixel graphic resolution.andP;  The unit also comes equipped with one paralleland two serial ports.andP;  It can withstand temperatures ranging from -22 degreesF to 158 degrees F, and it resists blowing rain, petrochemical immersion and&quot;transient drops.&quot;andM;Software for the PC/4000 can be developed on an ordinary desktop PC andtransferred via serial link to the former for storage in its nonvolatilememory.andM;Atari Computer announced its own MS-DOs handheld computer, the Portfolio,which will be released in June.andP;  It will contain a 4.92-MHz 80C88 chip, 128KB of RAM (expandable via memory cards containing up to 640K), a 240 X64-pixel LCD display showing 40 columns by 8 lines, and a 63-key Qwertykeyboard.andP;  Simplified word processing and spreadsheet programs and anappointment calendar and phone directory will be included.andM;Packed into a 7.8 X 4.1 X 1.2-inch case, the Portfolio will weigh about onepound.andP;  The price will be &quot;under $400&quot; (translation: $395 or $399).andM;Handheld computers are particularly useful for field data collection andanalysis applications, such as in the petrochemical industry, as well as forother applications where you may want to bring your favorite DOS-basedprograms into a harsh environment.andP;  Unfortunately, we were unable to try thePC/4000 with XyWrite to see whether it can serve as a writer's tool in harshenvironments as well.andM;Intel unveils next-generation chipandM;The most anticipated, and arguably the most important, announcement at Comdexbelonged to Intel.andP;  Although new developments such as 4-MBit memory chips andhandheld computers contribute their bit to the success of the PC industry,the introduction of a new member of the 80X86 family garners the lion's shareof attention from all quarters of that fraternity.andM;Behold the i486!andP;  Intel unveiled the long-awaited i486 microprocessor, thesuccessor to the 80X86 series, at the show and accompanied it with anannouncement that 33-MHz versions of the 80386 were now shipping.andP;  (Indeed, adozen or more companies showed 33-MHz machines or motherboards at the show ina tour de force that gives some indication of the degree to which thetechnological pace of this industry has accelerated.)andM;The i486 (Intel's preferred brand name for the 80486 part; it is alsoincreasingly referring to the 80386 as the i386) is the second Intelmicroprocessor to shatter the 1-million-transistor barrier, weighing in at1.2 million (and breaking the i860's short-lived record of 1 million set inFebruary).andP;  The i486 contains the full instruction set of the 80386 processorand the 80387 math coprocessor integrated on one chip, as well as a pagingand memory management unit (compatible with both the 80386 and the i860) andan 8-KB data and instruction cache.andM;At 25 MHz (the first chip speed that will be available to manufacturers), thei486 processor clocks in at 37,000 Dhrystones/sec.andP;  and executes 6.1double-precision MWhetstones/sec.andP;  At 33 MHz, the i486 provides49,000Dhrystones/sec.andP;  and 8.2 double-precision MWhetstones/sec.andP;  On the MIPSscale the i486 clocks 15 Vax MIPS at 25 MHz, and 20 Vax MIPS at 33 MHz,placing it (deliberately) in the same league as SPARC, 88000, and MIPS R3000RISC-based systems.andM;High-RISC features.andP;  Since one of the principal design goals of the i486 was100% compatibility with both the 80386 and 80387, and i486's designers hadless leeway to build in new high-performance features.andP;  The chip'sperformance instead comes from the large on-board pipe-lining cache and theuse of RISC design techniques that allow frequently used instructions, suchas load and store, to be executed in one clock cycle.andP;  Furthermore, a newburst data transfer mechanism allows four 32-bit words to be readsequentially from memory to keep the on-chip data and instruction cachefilled.andP;  Six new instructions have been added, principally to facilitatemultiprocessing, which is expected to be one of the i486's key applications.andM;The i486 is currently being beta tested, with samples to be available in thethird quarter of this year and production quantities in the fourth quarter.andO;This doesn't mean that &quot;key accounts&quot; won't be able to sample the chipearlier.andP;  IBM reportedly demoed a modified PS/2 Model 70 with the 25-MHz i486a day after the announcement in Chicago.andP;  James Cannavino, IBM's EntrySystems Division chief, said that it took technicians less than three hoursto modify the machine to incorporate the i486.andP;  Preliminary benchmarksindicated that the chip doubles the speed of the Model 70.andP;  You can also betthat Compaq is running samples in some of its boxes at this very moment.andM;Because of its high price ($950 each in 1000-piece quantities), andperformance far in excess of what most current applications require, Intelexpects that the first applications for the i486 will include networkservers, CAD stations, Unix  implementations and various technical andscientific uses.andP;  However, more than 27 hardware and software vendors linedup to announce support for the i486 in future products, and we woundn't besurprised to find it in several of the ubiquitous Taiwanese motherboards atComdex/Fall this November.andM;i386 under siege.andP;  At the announcement itself, Microsoft's Bill Gates, IBM'sCannavino, Compaq's Ron Canion and Borland's Philippe Kahn took turns givingtestimonials to the new-boarn standard, heralding it as the next in a longlineage of Intel chips that serve the industry as the &quot;Keeper of the PCstandard flame.&quot;andP;  Gates in particular noted that the upcoming 32-bit releaseof OS/2 (available to developers this year, and to the public next year willrun on the i486 right out of the box because of the high level ofcompatibility between the 386 and 486 architectures.andP;  For its part, Intelspent much of the announcement comparing the chip's features and peerformanceto the RISC offerings used by the workstation vendors, rather than toMotorola's soon-to-be-announced 68040, which is already being billed asMotorola's answer to the i486.andM;Waiting in the wings.andP;  Motorola's pre-announced specifications for the 68040,which has not yet been cast in silicon, are remarkably similar to the i486'sspecs.andP;  The '040 will integrate the 68882 floating-point unit with the68030's instruction set and memory management unit, and it will enlarge theinstruction and data caches to achieve greater performances.andP;  The chip willalso weigh in at 1.2 million transistors, and it allegedly will run at 13.5MIPS of unspecified flavor at 25 MHz.andP;  A redesigned ALU and pipelining willalso enable many instruction to be executed in one or two clock cycles.andM;The chip is expected to cost much less than the i486, however--between $400and $700.andM;The similarities between the Intel and Motorola offerings underscore anotherchange the industry is undergoing.andP;  Whereas in the past developers chose the680X0 for engineering and other graphics-intensive applications, today thechoice is less a matter of features and more a matter of preference--andreligion.andM;Propitious timing.andP;  The i486's positioning at the Intel announcement was noaccident.andP;  The announcement came at a particularly propitious time in theindustry for both Intel itself and the IBM/Microsoft/Intel CISC-basedcomputing model in general.andP;  Intel's hegemony over the 80386 market has beenunder simultaneous assult from two fronts of late.andP;  Unlike the 808X and 80286processors, which Intel licensed to several other silicon foundries, Inteldecided to keep the 80386 all to itself.andP;  (The exception is IBM, which hasmanufacturing rights to the chip--which it recently announced it wouldexercise.)andM;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which had negotiated a 10-year technologyexchange agreement with Intel--through which it had obtained the right tomanufacture the 80286--sued Intel after the 80386 was announced to obtain therights to manufacture that chip.andP;  Recently the judge in the case ruled thatIntel had &quot;...andP;  breached its implied covenant to negotiate reasonably ...&quot; ameans of enabling AMD to qualify to manufacture the 80386.andP;  Although thedecision doesn't automatically mean that AMD can manufacture the 80386, thiscould well be the consequence of any decision on how AMD can recoup thecontract damage it sustained.andM;Meanwhile, on the 80286 front (the chip that wouldn't die), Harris recentlyannounced a 25-MHz CMOS versions of the chip that it claims outperforms the16-MHz i386SX--the chip that is intended (by Intel) to kill it.andM;CISC VS.andP;  RISC.andP;  The drama over the 386's fortunes is entertaining andsignificant (because it could lower the price of 386 implementations in thelong run).andP;  But the real action--as Intel, IBM, Microsoft and the otherindustry heavyweights are well aware--is in the matchup with RISCarchitectures.andM;Although IBM kicked off the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) vs.andO;Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) wars itself a few years back when itintroduced the RT, it wasn't until Sun announced its SPARC-based Sun-4 linein 1987 that the industry sat up and took notice.andP;  Promising performance(measured in RISC MIPS) far in excess of anything possible with CISC,manufacturers of RISC-based computers (primarily the players in theworkstation market) have been promoting them of late as the architecture forthe future of computing.andM;RISC machines rack up these impressive numbers by limiting their instructionssets to the simplest operations, such as load and move, which can thereforebe optimized to execute in many fewer instruction cycles than most CISCmachines can achieve.andM;The drawbacks to RISC designs are twofold.andP;  First, they typically cost morethan CISC designs because they require more auxiliary support chips.andP;  Second,none of the RISC products are 80386s.andP;  Although this seems self-evident--andindeed, many of the RISC-based workstation vendors are promising MS-DOSemulation in their products--the fact remains that the overwhelming majorityof desktop computing applications reside on CISC-based machines like the80386 clones (and, for that matter, the 680X0-based Macintoshes).andM;This explains why so much of the i486 announcement was given over tosimultaneous praise for the $15 billion MS-DOS application software industry,which is based on the Intel CISC product line, and shots at the RISCarchitectures.andP;  Yet at the same time Intel and Motorola are clearly hedgingtheir bets.andP;  NEt only are they incorporating RISC design techniques intotheir newest CISC products, but both companies have joined the RISC ranks aswell: Motorola with its 88000 chip set, Intel with its recently announcedi860.andM;Bill Gates, who is well known for picking the winning horses in thisindustry, recently said that he expects CISC performance to match RISCperformance for a couple more years, but that the gap should begin to open upin the early 1990s.andP;  And, just as Microsoft has hedged its bets bymaintaining a significant Unix development effort (Microsoft's Xenix is infact the largest-selling Unix implementation), Gates indicated that Microsoftis currently re-engineering OS/2 to be more portable--with the i860 being thefirst likely port.andM;Printers and ControllersandM;Comdex Spring isn't noted for hosting a rash of new product announcements.andO;But if you walk the aisles you can be certain of turning up new wonders thathaven't gotten a lot of attention in the press before.andP;  In this section wewill report on both the new and the unusual.andM;Printers, controllers and PostScriptandM;Several trends appeared among the printer and printer controller vendors atComdes: the continued seepage of PostScript into new channels, a spate of 400X 400-dpi implementations of the Canon SX print engine, and increasedattention for alternative methods of page description.andM;Dot-matrix printer vendors are realizing that the same market forces thatdrove them to release LaserJet clones a year or two ago are now pushing forPostScript.andP;  Companies such as Fujitsu and Olympia have decided to offer atleast a token PostScript laster printer to keep their dealers happy.andM;Vendors such as NewGen (see below) are taking advantage of a version of theSX engine that has been increased from 300 dpi to 400 dpi by jiggering atiming crystal.andP;  LaserMaster, which drove the basic SX at 600 X 300, hasdeveloped a way to drive the 400-dpi version at 900 X 400--six times theresolution of a 300 X 300-dpi machine.andM;LaserMaster and Canon were both hawking alternatives to PostScript:LaserMaster for both screen display and output, Canon for output only.andP;  Asmuch as we press for standards, we realize that few standards do everythingwell, and it is always interesting to see vendors try to do outdo thestandard in specific ways (in this case, mostly speed, PostScript'sacknowledged Achilles' heel).andM;IBM offers vendors PM printer drivers.andP;  While Presentation Manager versionsof popular software (Ventura Publisher, PageMaker, and Rbase databaseprogram) finally began to bloom in profusion on the Comdex show floor, IBMwas pushing hard behind the scenes to speed OS/2's acceptance.andP;  Haunted bythe spectre of users either sticking with DOS or jumping into Unix, Big Bluemade printer vendors an extraordinary offer: not only would IBM and Microsoft(equal partners in OS/2) help them develop Presentation Manager drivers asquickly as possible (through designated developer Bauer Enterprises), but IBMand Microsoft would even distribute these drivers.andM;This offer might shock computer cognoscenti who are familiar with IBM'sallergy against promoting competitors' products.andP;  The move shows that IBm ispulling out all stops--the time to establish OS/2 in the marketplace is now,and the window of opportunity must be thrown wide open to bring aboard keyplayers in the industry before it slams shut on IBM's and Microsoft'scollective fingers.andM;The printer vendors to whose indoctrinations we were privy seemed glad forthe offer.andP;  Even if OS/2 does not quickly capture as large a market share asits adherents hope, the sheer amount of muscle behind it decrees thathardware vendors must sooner or later support it.andP;  Why not seize freeassistance for a task that the vendors must face anyway?andM;The road to success.andP;  IBM views four factors as crucial for the success ofOS/2.andP;  Leading software applications from the top developers must becomeavailable; memory (which the new operating system consumes in large chunks)must become more accessible and affordable; corporate customers must developproprietary applications; and there must be enough printer drivers toreassure customers that they can continue to use their existing printers orchoose from a wide array of new ones.andP;   The first of these conditions is juststarting to be met; the second is improving, as memory prices are now glidingsoftly downward; the third should come with a bit more time; and IBM isbringing about the fourth.andM;IBM is working to develop a method of distributing third-party printerdrivers separately from its own OS/2 products so as not to constrain thereleases of either.andM;PostScript printers--monochromeandM;Marubeni's 600-dpi PostScript/ACE unit.andP;  At a show &quot;peopled&quot; by too clones ofvarious sorts, we were glad to stumble on a genuinely new and interestinglaser printer from Marubeni.andP;  Based on a 600 X 600-dpi, A3 size (roughly11-1/2&quot; X 16-1/2&quot;) engine from Copal (a Fujitsu subsidiary), it sports aChelgraph RIP that interprets both PostScript (using the fast Hyphenimplementation) and Ace, a language used to drive some high-resolutionimagesetters.andP;  Marubein positions the printer, which turns out 12 A4 (about11-1/2&quot; X 8-1/4&quot;) pages per minute, as a source of either proofs or finaloutput.andM;The Chelgraph controller, which uses a Motorola 88000 RISC processor, hasRS232, Centronics parallel and AppleTalk interfaces.andP;  It offers the 35 fontsused in Apple's LaserWriter Plus.andM;Chelgraph has had a unit in-house for months and professes to be delightedwith its reliability and print quality.andP;  We were impressed with the outputsamples: the black areas were black, six-point type was extremely sharp andclear, and there was no evidence of the bandng that afflicts so manyprinters.andP;  We should note, though, that the printer was using a speciallydeveloped paper from John Blishen called Laser-Pro 100, which gave a crisperappearance than plain paper; this paper will be recommened for use with theunit.andM;Though the printer has been seen in Europe, this was its first U.S.andP;  showing.andO;Chelgraph and its distributors will begin selling it in Europe in July.andP;  Inthe U.S., it will be sold by Chelgraph's main distributor, Electra Products,and through other channels.andP;  The Marubein printer will be priced at $24,000,the same as Varityper's large-format 600-dpi PostScript printer, the VT-600W.andM;The 300-dpi newcomers.andP;  Fujitsu began shipping a 2-MB printer, the RX7100PS,at Comdex, where it also announced a 4-MB version.andP;  The RX7100PS is built onan LEd engine by Copal and an Adobe RIP (the usual 35 fonts are included),and it offers AppleTalk, RS-232C, RS-422 serial and Centronics parallelinterfaces.andP;  The process cartridge ($185) is rated for 6,000 pages at 5%print density.andM;The RX7100PS stands out from the usual run of lookalkie printers by dint ofits paper path.andP;  Two 150-sheet bins sit vertically atop the printer; thepaper travels a shorter path than in usual horizontal-fed printers.andP;  Anevelope feeder is also standard.andM;Pricing on the RX7100PS is $4,495 for the 2-MB version and $4,995 for the4-MB version (scheduled to be shipped in June).andM;In July, AEG Olympia will release a PostScript version of its Laserstar 6printer, which uses a Ricoh engine.andP;  We cannot yet report the price of thismodel or the source of its PostScript implementation.andM;NewGen Systems introduced 300 X 300 and 400 X 400 printers based on the CanonSX 8-ppm engine.andP;  A measure such as &quot;8 ppm&quot; can be deceiving: it representsthe maximum possible output rate, which can be achieved only if thecontroller keeps up with the print engine.andP;  NewGen's controller, which usesthe RIPS PostScript translation code (see p. 38 for a review of the RIPSPostScript controller board), links an Intel 80960KB RISC microcontroller toan Intel 80186 serving as an I/O coprocessor to ensure that the engine canrun at its maximum speed more often than with typical controllers.andP;  Bothprinter models can be upgraded to provide double buffering for extra speed.andM;Centronics parallel, RS-232C serial and AppleTalk interfaces are provided;SCSI interfaces are optional, as is a hard disk for font and file storage.andO;The TurboPS-300 and TurboPS/400 will sell for $5,495 and $6,495 respectively;paying 18% more dollars seems like a small added cost for 78% more pixels.andM;PostScript printers--colorandM;The color PostScript output spotlight was focused on QMS, which introduced ata developers' meeting its Presentation Manager Graphic Programming Interface(GPI) color printer (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  8, p. 27).andP;  Based on a new Mitsubishi8-1/2&quot; X 11&quot;, 300-dpi engine, it supports PostScript (through QMS subsidiaryImagen's UltraScript clone), PCL, HPGL and PM-Script, which gives it its GPIfunctionality.andP;  Fonts (from Imagen, which has rights to the Linotype fontlibrary) reside on the host's hard disk.andM;The printer will be released to developers this summer, and end users arelikely to have it toward the end of the year.andP;  QMS would not specify end-userpricing, but developers, who typically get 50% off list, will pay $ 5,000 forit.andP;  As a QMS representative coyly said: &quot;You figure out the math.&quot;andM;In addition to the Phaser CPS Color PrintStation shown at last fall's Comdex(see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  4, p. 15), Tektronix had another, lower-end color outputdevice: the ColorQuick, a 216-dpi inkjet machine.andP;  It will handle A3 and A4stock as well as sizes from 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; x 18&quot;.andP;  The print stock can be plainor coated paper or transparency film; automatic sheet and roll feeders areincluded, and a tractor feeder is optional.andM;Tektronix announced recently that the ColorQuikc will fully support Apple'snew 32-bit color QuickDraw (see page 49).andP;  However, the Phaser PSPrintStation cannot drive the ColorQuick, so it will have no PostScriptcapabilities.andM;Equipped with SCSI and Centronics ports and the LaserWriter Plus font set,the ColorQuick will sell for $2,495.andP;  Production shipments are scheduled forAugust.andM;PostScript clonesandM;The list of PostScript cloners grows ever longer, and most of the ones wewere aware of (and one we weren't) showed up in Chicago.andM;Elsewhere in this issue (see page 29), we review some of the leading productsfor injecting PostScript capabilities into non-PostScript devices.andP;  Here, wewill mention only the new capabilities being shown at Comdex.andM;Bauer suite treats, and EiconView too.andP;  The Bauer Enterprises hotel suiteheld several items of interest.andP;  Bauer has ported its PostScriptimplementation to the 80960 chip that is used in Intel's iLaser III board.andO;The company reports that its interpreter is roughly seven times as fast asthe Apple LaserWriter IINT's, and that it is trying to optimize its code toincrease that to an eight- to ten-fold improvement.andM;Bauer offered us a look at its work on PostScript-compatible Asian-languagefonts.andP;  It is producing both Japanese Kanji, based on Ricoh fonts (see Vol.andO;3, No.andP;  4, p. 14), and Chinese characters (enough to handle the &quot;Big Five&quot;dialects), from an unnamed source, with an 80186 chip and will move them tohigher-speed chips.andP;  The Chinese fonts are not yet in Bezier format, so theyare not of the highest possible quality.andM;Korean is the next character set on Bauer's list.andP;  The firm is aiming to makeits PostScript fonts the standards in China and Korea, where no dominantstandards exist, but it faces an uphill battle in Japan against Adobe.andM;For the time begin, Bauer is devoting the lion's share of its energies todeveloping device drivers for OS/2 (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  4, p. 31 and thisissue, p. 14).andP;  Once that effort calms down a bit, it will return to Asianfonts.andM;There were also items of interest in the Eicon Technology booth: a betaversion of the next release of its PostScript controller board, and a utilitythat lets the user display and modify files stored in the controller's framebuffer.andP;  Version 2.20 of EiconScript (see p. 35) was slated for a late Aprilrelease.andP;  It was demonstrated on an Eicon card driving the Canon SX engine at300 X 600 dpi; on an HP LaserJet II, it is claimed to produce more than sevencharacter pages per minute at that resolution.andM;EiconView, to be released in May for about $300, displays the contents of theprinter controllers frame buffer within Windows.andP;  The user can open anediting window to see the PostScript commands that are producing the display,then modify these commands or add new ones.andP;  Starting at a user-specifiedresolution, the page can be displayed at a 1:1 pixel ratio or at half ordouble scale.andP;  A coordinate reading shows the cursor's location at all times.andO;This program will be a boon to the PostScript mavens among Eicon's customerbase.andM;More controller news.andP;  Phoenix Technologies showed its familiar PhoenixPagesoftware at work.andP;  The company has, like Bauer, ported its software to theIntel i960 chip.andP;  Phoenix has announced that it will offer ITC typefaces withPhoenixPage, and it has licensed the latter product to Entire, Inc., of Rochester, NY.andM;Abaton is selling the PostCar Plus ($1,795), a PostScript printer controllerthat uses Bauer's emulation.andP;  It translates PostScript into PCL or intoEpson's FX or LQ graphics language, and it contains 35 Bitstream fonts and 3MB of RAM (an additional 2 MB is optional).andP;  The PostCard Plus's main claimto fame is that in addition to the LaserJet family and Epson FX and LQdot-matrix printers, it also drives the HP Deskjet line.andP;  It was releasedearlier this year.andM;GVC-Chenel, a Taiwanese corporation with offices in New Jersey andCalifornia, also showed a controller based on the Bauer code.andP;  Designed foruse with Canon's LBP-CX or -SX printers, the LP-M1 card, which we also saw atFall Comdex, fits in a PC and can be connected via an adapter to the HPLaserJet series and the Canon LBP-8II; later, it will be available for usewith the Ricoh 1060 engine.andP;  The first version, slated to appear in lateApril, will sell for about $1,000 with no RAM; it can hold up to 4 MB.andM;Destiny Technology's big news was that its PostScript board for PCs will besold through Radio Shack's Special Order Program.andP;  The PageStyler board willbe offered as an upgrade to bring PostScript functionality to the Tandy LP1000 laser printer.andP;  The standard PageStyler, with 2.5 MB of RAM and 13Bitstream fonts, will sell for $1,890; it can be upgraded to 4.k MB and 35fonts.andM;Pan Overseas Technologies Corp, a New  Jersey company by way of Taiwan, hasdevised PostScript emulations for both output and display using proprietarytechniques that it claims will result in significantly faster fileprocessing.andP;  No product has been released, though the company has formed analliance with a major peripheral vendor that has contracts with some of thelargest PC-compatible makers.andP;  Cirrus Logic, which manufactures chips forgraphics and other applications, uses the Pan Overseas emulation to show OEMsthe capabilities of its printer accelerator chips.andM;Right now, Pan Overseas is proceeding cautiously, trying to identify anypotential problems before a product is released.andP;  We expect to see productsbased on its technology later this year.andM;This software market isn't soft.andP;  Both LaserGo and Custom Applications Inc.andO;(CAI) have found a fertile market for software-only PostScripotimplementations.andP;  Having had this market to themselves for the nonce, theyare battling each other while trying to move far enough ahead to discourageany Johnny-come-latelies.andM;At least one new competitor has surfaced: QMS, which uses an interpreterdeveloped by its Imagen subsidiary.andP;  UltraScript PC (22 Linotype fonts, $195)and UltraScript PC plus (47 fonts, $445) were both released as of the show.andO;They support the HP LaserJet II and DeskJet, Canon BJ-130, Epson FX, LX andLQ, and IBM Proprinter 24 and Graphics, as well as any printer emulatingthose.andP;  Because QMS was already marketing PostScript-compatible laserprinters, it obviously had the technology.andP;  We expect to see a color versionof UltraScript PC before too long, using the same technology as QMS'sPostScript color printers.andM;Even with QMS's entry, the market for software-only PostScript interpretersis growing too quickly to be near vendor saturation.andP;  Who will be the nextentrant, and what added value will they have to offer?andM;LAserGo released GoScript 2.1, which is available in two versions: the basicone ($195), with 13 fonts, and the Plus Edition ($395), with 35 fonts.andP;  Tothe functionality of GoScriopt 2.0, it adds print-to-disk capabilities(useful for batch output printing), faster bit-mapped image processing andthe ability to save and restore bit-mapped images.andP;  It can downloadadditional fonts (URW fonts will be available beginning in late April forless than $100 per family) without switching programs.andM;Also demonstrated was GoScript 386, which can print from within applicationprograms and, according to LaserGo, runs at least twice as fast on a '386 PCas GoScript 2.0.andP;  Both new GoScript were scheduled for May shipments.andM;The most attention was being drawn by GoScript/Color, which was producingsamples on a Hewlett-Packard PaintJet.andP;  It also drives some dot-matrixprinters; more drivers are being added.andP;  Due out later this quarter, it willsell for $295 with 13 fonts or $495 with 35 fonts.andM;CAI's Freedom of Press interpreter is available now for PCs; the Macintoshversion is planned for August.andP;  CAI officially announced an agreement withPresentation Technologies that will result in a PostScript-compatible desktopcolor film recorder.andP;  PostScript files will be run through Freedom of Pressand output on Presentation Technologies' Montage FR1 film recorder (see p.andO;54).andM;In its booth, CAI was printing PostScript files on a Seiko CH-5303 colorprint, a 240-dpi CMY device.andP;  Starting in June, Freedom of Press will bebundled with this printer, which will be available in single-pass ($5,995) orthree-pass ($4,995) versions.andP;  The output samples we saw looked good, thoughnot breathtaking.andM;Freedom of Press uses Compugraphic Intellifonts; later this year, CAI willadd Bitstream Fontware capabilities.andP;  A '386 protected-mode version ofFreedom of Press is coming this summer.andM;Page description alternativeandM;CSS supports GPI, others.andP;  As part of its O.A.andP;  (Open Architecture) WriterSeries, envisioned as a series of printers driven by its GRIP (Generic RasterImage Processor) controller, CSS Labs showed the OA Writer 223, a 22-ppmprinter built around a Minolta 300-dpi engine.andP;  Priced at $19,500, the OAWriter 223 is currently being shipped only to California accounts while CSSsets up a nationwide service organization.andM;The GRIP controller drives printers directly from GEM and the Xerox 3700command language (and will do so from Windows in a month or two) and emulatesLaserJet II and Epson FX as well as some plotters, line printers and otheroptions.andP;  CSS plans to be supporting GPI--that is, driving printers directlyfrom Presentation Manager--in the latter half of this year.andM;Readers may wonder why PostScript is missing from the list of available orcoming emulations.andP;  CSS believes that in the long run, PostScript will becast aside as a standard in favor of driving printers directly fromenvironments such as Presentation Manager.andP;  In the short run, of course, themarket still calls the shots, so we doubt that CSS has completely ruled outPostScript.andM;Since the GRIP controller is based on Inmos transputer chips, a number ofthem can be networked to act as one powerful device.andP;  CSS recommends thatusers develop applications other than printing, such as number crunching, toharness the power of these chips.andP;  The current model contains the 10-MIPST-414/800 transputer; that speed is multiplied by the number of linked GRIPboards, so compute-intensive applications could run well on a GRIP-ladennetwork.andM;Also later this year, CSS will release a color printer that supports GPI.andO;Unlike the QMS color GPI printer shown to developers at Comdex, the CSS unitwill image on plain paper, not just thermal.andP;  It is being designed to producemany pages per minute, whereas the QMS model outputs less than 1 ppm.andP;  CSS'scolor printer will also offer a black-and-white mode with even fasterprinting; the company plans to price the printer to be a good value just forits black-and-white abilities, so that color output will be a bonus.andM;Within its OA Writer product line, CSS also sells controllers to upgrade thecapabilities of specific printers.andP;  Its Xerox 4045 upgrade ($4,300) drivesthat unit as 10 ppm.andP;  Upgrade kits for the HP 2000 and LaserJer II are bothplanned for June releasees.andM;Canon and its fast LIPS.andP;  In the page description area, Canon has adopted theage-old strategy of walking both sides of the fence.andP;  Even as it showed a300-dpi laser printer using Canon's proprietary LIPS-III controller (theacronym stands for &quot;LBP [laser beam printer] Image Processing System-III&quot;),the company announced plans for a PostScript version of the same print laterthis year.andP;  Since Canon says that the LIPS-III prevents users from having tochoose &quot;between fast and simple or sophisticated and slow,&quot; it's noteworthythat customers will also have the option of buying &quot;sophisticated and slowtechnology&quot; from Canon.andM;There are three versions of the LBP-8 Mark III printer, all built (naturallyenough) on Canon's own SX engine.andP;  The basic model ($2,995, due out in May)has a single 200-sheet tray; the Mark III T ($3,995, due in July) has twosuch bins; and the Mark III R ($4,495, also due in July) offers both dualbins and duplex printing.andM;The LIP-III controller, which contains a National Semiconductor 32CG16processor, has nine built-in scalable fonts (Swiss and Dutch in four styleseach and a Symbol font) along with eight styles of bit-mapped Courier.andP;  Anadditional 22 scalable fonts are available via plug-in font cards, as are anumber of bit-mapped ones in both portrait and landscape orientations.andP;  Thefonts come from Bitstream; Canon has jimmied them to work in its format.andM;Programmers interested in writing in the LIPS language can obtain a set ofreference manuals from Canon.andP;  Will many programmers do so?andP;  As in any goodchicken-and-egg situation, that depends largely on whether they believe LIPSwill claim any significant market share--which, in turn, will be largelydetermined by the number of applications that can drive LIPS devices.andM;We must look askance at a new entry into a field (page description languages)currently dominated by an overwhelmingly accepted standard, but when the newentrant is the world's largest manufacturer of laser printer engines, itcannot be easily dismissed.andM;LaserMaster: a new year's higher resolutions.andP;  Besides showing off the LX6Professional printer controller (released in December) and DSP1 displaycontroller (being shipped in April) that it introduced at least fall's Comdex(see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  4, p. 15), LaserMaster hinted at a couple of new productsdue out this summer.andP;  Both combine the speedy LaserMaster rasterizingtechnology with improved resolution.andM;The first product, a display controller, will push the resolution from theDSP1's 1024 x 1024 pixels to 1280 x 1024.andP;  It will be available for twomonitors: a 19&quot; monochrome model and a 15&quot; portrait monochrome one.andP;  Wepresume that, like the DPS1, the new display controller will work with allGEM and Windows applications and will display PostScript files (bytranslating them into LaserMaster's proprietary command language), including fonts with Adobe-compatible widths.andP;  No information is available yet onpricing.andM;The second forthcoming product takes advantage of the Canon SX engine'sability to output at 400 x 400 dpi through an adjustment of a timing crystal.andO;Whereas the LX6 controller drives the common 300 x 300-dpi SX engine at 600 x300, the new controller will push the 400 x 400 version to 900 x 400--thesame dot density as a 600 x 600 printer such as the Variety-per VT-600.andO;LaserMaster will package the new controller with an SX-based printer forabout $8,000-$9,000, well below the price of any 600 x 600-dpi printercurrently available.andP;  Assuming that the new controller supports at least asmany applications as the LX6, and that its capabilities are viewed as anadequate substitute for true PostScript, LaserMaster's printer package shouldfind favor with budget-minded users who need crisp plain-paper proofs orfinal output.andM;Grayscale printingandM;At Comdex last fall, we reported on Intel's Visual Edge board and DP-Tek'sLaserPort GrayScale board, each of which can simulate gray scales on an HPLaserJet.andP;  Another entry into this market appeared in Chicago.andP;  Tall TreeSystems was snapping passersby with a still video camera, then printing theirpictures in grayscale form on a LaserJet II using its JLaser5 controllerboard.andP;  Officially introduced at this show, the JLaser5 has been in betatesting for about two months; mass distribution of the PC version was plannedto begin in late April, and the Macintosh version was expected in May orJune.andM;The JLaser5 board &quot;modulates&quot; the LaserJet II's laser beam at 4,800horizontal dpi (compared to the Visual Edge's 1,200) by 300 vertical dpi.andP;  Itcan create up to 256 gray scales on a 53-lpi screen or 128 gray scales on a106-lpi screen.andP;  With the required 2 MB of EMS memory, it can buffer a fullpage of graphics.andP;  A high-speed video interface cable connects it to a secondboard in the LaserJet's video option port.andP;  Tall Tree says its package makesgraphics printing 2-6 times faster.andM;The package will sell for $399, o for $799 with a 2-MB EMS board that wouldenable data to bypass the computer's memory board as well as the printercontroller.andP;  Tall Tree will also market its own video capture board for about$600.andM;Networking and Application SoftwareandM;Networking productsandM;The network and workgroup computing announcement at the show that generatedthe most excitement (if for no other reason than that it managed to get DavidMahoney, CEO of Banyan Systems; John McElroy, LAN product manager for IBM;Ray Noorda, CEO of Novell; Bill Krause, CEO of 3Com; and An Wang, CEO of Wangto sit together side-by-side in a row) was that of Wang's Freestyle on LANs.andM;We first saw Freestyle, a novel PC-based information management andcommunications tool, at last fall's Comdex (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  4, p. 4 for adescription of the product).andP;  At the time, we had two major objections to it.andO;Freestyle for LANs addresses the first of these, the necessity to buy a WangVS system, by making it possible to run Freestyle on any of the four majorLANs in conjunction with Wang's LAN Office, an integrated suite of officeautomation applications with E-mail, task, and time management facilities.andO;LAN Office can run on any LAN and be bridged to other LANs without requiringa VS system in the equation, although it can obviously communicate with anyVS system that is linked to the LANs.andM;The Freestyle-LAN Office interface is priced at $100 per client PC and willbe available in the third quarter of this year.andM;Our second objection was the necessity of using a $2,000 hardware add-onpackage, consisting of a full-page tablet, interface card, electronic pencil(complete with an eraser that removes whatever you rub it against on thescreen), cable, and driver software.andP;  The hardware is integral to the conceptunderlying Freestyle--that executives prefer to scribble comments on adisplayed page rather than annotate it with keystrokes.andM;We are not as sure as Dr. Stephen Levine, Freestyle's developer, that thisparadigm serves the executive or the executive's company in the best stead.andO;Handwriting is no more legible on the screen than on paper.andP;  Executives mightdo better to take a short course in keyboarding--or to get a mouse.andM;Levine indicated that future versions of Freestyle will address this concernand add to the product greatly, carrying it forward into OS/2 and beyond.andO;Indeed, listening to Levine, the sky seemed to be the limit for Freestyle.andP;  Arecent New York Times article (April 17, 1989) suggests why this might be so:evidently Wang is &quot;betting its future&quot; on Freestyle revolutionizing officecommunications.andM;Levine and Wang are gambling that the paradigm for how &quot;thought istranslated&quot; in the office of the future is the pencil.andP;  We aren't convincedof that, but we still believe Freestyle represents one of the freshest andmost innovative approaches to redefining the paradigm of office computingsince the spreadsheet.andP;  We wish it well.andM;In other LAN-related news, Toshiba introduced a $699 Ethernet card that fitsin the internal slot of most of its laptops/portables.andP;  It will shipinitially with Novell drivers, with other network drivers to follow.andM;Several companies introduced netstations, which are highly integrated PCs(either diskless or with disk options) bundled with a LAN connector (usuallyEthernet).andP;  Samsung introduced a series of of netstation, server and Ethernetcontroller products--which souldn't have been surprising since it took overNovell's hardward product line when the latter decided to get out of thehardware business last year.andP;  (Samsung ad supplied many of these componentsto Novell on an OEM basis originally anyway.)andP;  Samsung's network offeringcome labeled as Novell licensed products, which shouldn't hurt them in theNetware market.andM;Samsung's netstation is a 12-MHz AT-compatible with EGA/VGA support and oneor two floppy drives.andP;  It can be booted either from the floppy or disklesswith an Autoboot PROM on the network adapter.andP;  It has 640 KB of memory andsupports an 80287 math coprocessor.andP;  Pricing is under $2,500.andM;Televido introduced its Telestation family, consisting of three disklessworkstations and a 25-MHz 80386-based file server.andP;  The TS2 netstation, whichlists for $1,395, utilizes a 10-MHz 80286 and 512 KB of RAM (expandable to2.5 MB) and support Hercules graphics.andP;  The TS3 is a 386sx model that comeswith 1 MB of RAM (expandable to 16 MB) and is available in two models: VGAmonochrome for $2,995, and VGA color for $3,195.andP;  Both include Novell NetwareAutoboot support.andP;  The Tele 386/25 comes preconfigured with Novell's AdvancedNetware and is available in two versions: the 150FS, with a 150-MB 1:1interleaved disk, and the 300FS, with a 300-MB disk.andP;  Both versions have 10available bus slots, plus 2 MB of RAM and 32 KB of fast cache memory.andP;  The150FS is priced a $11,190 (no price for the 300FS was given).andM;Taking a different tack, Cubix Corporation has placed the electronics forfour XT compatibles (or two AT compatibles) on a single card that fits intoan available slot in your file server.andP;  Buyers can then use an inexpensivedumb terminal (with no fan) on their desks, connected to the card viahigh-speed serial lines (up to 150 feet), just as they would a disklessnetstation.andP;  Cubix's QL family (as it is called) has been Novell Netwaretested and approved.andP;  Pricing ranges from $645 for the 1 PC model to $2,695for the 2 AT version.andP;  With the prices of PC and AT clones plummeting as theyhave been, it is difficult to see the rationale behind this approach otherthan small footprint and centralized servicing.andP;  To each his own, however.andM;Pacstor, which is from Los Gatos, CA, and is partially owned by Key Tronic,showed an innovative fault-tolerant disk storage subsystem targeted atnetwork servers.andP;  The Integra I comes in a PC-style chassis with up to sixhard disks in it, for a total of 500 MB of storage.andP;  Each disk is pluggedinto a common bus, which allows removal of a faulty disk while the system isstill running without data loss.andP;  The Integra I fault-tolerant function isimplemented in software, resident in 32 KB of the host computer.andP;  Allfeatures--error correction, failed drive data reconstruction and restorationto a replacement drive--are embodied in the software driver.andM;Here's how it works.andP;  The error correction code (ECC) employed to protectstored data is distributed across all six drives in the array.andP;  Correctioncode for data stored in a specific address on five of the drives is stored inthe same location on the sixth drive.andP;  A different drive stores the ECCinformation for each address.andP;  Address allocation for ECC data is done whenthe drives are formatted, prior to shipment.andM;Integra I lists for $9,500.andM;Another networking product of note was Gateway communications' G/RemoteBridge 64, which, the company says, can link any two Advanced Netware LANstogether transparently regardless of topology or geographic location.andP;  Theproduct, which consists of an 80186-based WNIM-186 hardware adapter and X.25bridging software, operates at speeds up to 64 Kbps.andP;  Users can bridge overan RS-232 or V.35 interface, with up to 128 virtual circuits per port.andO;Pricing for the product is $2,495 per link and $4,495 for the starter kit.andM;Xircom showed a machine-independent Pocket Ethernet Adapter for Laptops.andO;Priced at $695, the adapter plugs into the parallel port of your laptop andis powered by an external AC adapter.andP;  Drivers for Netware 2.0 and 2.1X areincluded, with support for 3Com and other network operating systems duelater.andM;Sitback Technologies announced a memory-resident product, called Sitback,which allows automatic total and  incremental backups for standalone PCs,networked PCs, and file servers.andP;  The software allows you to back up to anyuser-defined DOS device, including flopply drivers, removable hard disks,removable cartridge disks, other hard disks, or a network drive.andP;  Alas, itdoesn't support cartridge tape backup, which is the usual means of backing upnetwork servers, but at $99 list, you can't go wrong by trying it.andM;Two network communication products that are available for OS/2 LAN Managernetworks are The Network Courier, from Consumer's Software, andHyperAccess/5, by Hilgraeve.andP;  Both take advantage of OS/2's multitasking tosupport multiple sessions, true background operation, child processes, anddetached operation.andP;  The Network Courier supports links to IBM's Profs andDEC's All-In-One, as well as to MCI Mail.andP;  It also supports remote user modemmail.andP;  HyperAccess/5 retails for $199; no price was available for the NetworkCourier.andM;Composition SoftwareandM;The largest news in composition software was the double vision of VenturaPublisher and PageMaker running under Presentation Manager.andP;  Most of theother competitors had little news of substance, but we were impressed by abeta version of a forthcoming program from TimeWorks, which is known as avendor of low-end desktop composition packages.andM;VP and PM under PM.andP;  Ventura president John Meyer was bubbling with pleasureas he showed off Ventura Publisher's sexy Presentation Manager version(scheduled for a third-guarter release), and the no-less-enhanced PM versionof PageMaker also drew praise.andP;  Although, as we mentioned earlier, Ventura'sport from GEM to OS/2 was performed quickly, and Aldus's port from DOS wasfinished even before that, both appear to be a giant leap for the software.andO;Thanks to OS/2's multitasking abilities, tasks that were once run assingle-threaded (series) operations can now be run as multithreaded(parallel) ones, vastly increasing system speed.andP;  No more stopping work whilean application is printed; instead, printing (like handamp;j and other frequentlyused processes) runs in the background.andM;We saw that with several Ventura files open, not only text and objects butalso style tags could be copied between windows.andP;  Savvy users will likelycreate one file that consists only of style examples, then bring that up tochoose the style to apply to a file being constructed.andM;Beyond the normal OS/2 improvements, Aldus also developed additional supportfor IBM mainframe graphics.andP;  Aldus says the PM version of PageMaker will beavailable this summer for $795.andM;There will doubtless be the complement of bugs (or perhaps even a few more)to be wrung from the new versions, but publishers who use these programs fornon-trivial work should run to their local vendor for a demonstration as soonas the Presentation Manager versions are released.andP;  Clear improvements inspeed and ease of use await you.andM;Other MS-DOS composition news.andP;  The only other MS-DOS composition products wesaw were a new mid-level package from Logitech (shown in very rough form atlast fall's Comdex) and three different products based on the softwaredeveloped by Beyond Words: Canon's Express turnkey system, IMSI Publisher(formerly PagePerfect), and IBM's DisplayWrite Composer.andM;Rather than try to match the daunting power of the heavyweights, Logitech isaiming its new Finesse program (introductory price, $179; later, $199) atpeople who want more power than a product such as PFS: First Publisheroffers, but whose needs are simple enough to make PageMaker or VenturaPublisher overkill.andP;  Finesse runs under GEM; in additional to a reasonablearray of specified laser (PostScript and PCL) and dot-matrix printers, it candrive others via a driver pack available from Digital Research.andM;Finesse works o &quot;chapters,&quot; which are limited to 16 pages.andP;  It supportsautomatic runarounds, scaling and cropping of images, context-sensitive help,kerning (in points) and automatic hyphenation.andP;  (Note to composition vendors:if you adertise good typography, do not hand out data sheets withhyphenations such as &quot;qu-ality&quot; [Logitech] or &quot;documen-ts&quot; [Gold Disk].)andM;Finesse buyers will also get Bitstream Fontware (Dutch, Swiss, Courier andSymbol); seven templates and 70 clip-art images; and direct support forLogitech's ScanMan hand scanner.andP;  The program will be shipped in early June.andO;Future versions will have better graphics support and unlimited documentlength.andM;IBM's implementation of the Beyond Words development is the most recent;aimed squarely at users of the Display-Write word processing program, it wasdesigned to emulate many of that program's keyboard commands.andP;  Since wereviewed the other two products (see Vol.andP;  2, No.andP;  10), both IMSI and Canonhave invested much of their effort in ridding the software of bugs, a nobleambition.andM;Canon is putting far more resources into enhancing the software'sfunctionality than IMSI; this summer, it intends to release version 2.0 ofits product, which will be able to output files on PostScript printers (aswell as on LIPS printers--see page XX).andP;  Around that same time, Canon willoffer Adobe PostScript for its printers, so that version of the Expresspackage--a 25-MHz '386-based AT with 4 MB of RAM and a 100-MB hard disk, anIX30F 256-grayscale scanner, a Canon 300-dpi laser printer and thecomposition software--will be made available as a complete PostScriptpublishing solution.andP;  Canon is also working on an OS/2 version of the system.andM;A new entry from a familiar face.andP;  Since it entered the desktop compositionmarket, TimeWorks has been content to slug it out with Software PublishingCorp., Digital Research and other vendors of lower-echelon publishingsoftware.andP;  The main distinction of its product, Publish-It, was that it ranon several platforms: MS-DOS, Apple II and Atari St.andP;  The company claims aflat majority of the Apple II DTP market.andP;  Now, however, TimeWorks hasdecided to jump into the major leagues with its first rendition of Publish-Itfor the Macintosh.andP;  This summer it will release version 1.1 (1.0 designatesthe beta version), priced at $95 and boasting a feature list that more thanholds its own in terms of quantity; from what we saw in Chicago, the qualityis nearly there too.andP;  By the release date, Publish-It for the Mac should be aserious contender for the market dominated by PageMaker, Xpress andReadySetGo.andM;On the other hand, it is unlikely that any new Mac-based desktop publishingproduct will knock PageMaker from its top spot.andP;  Even Quark and Letraset havefound it tough to compete against the market leader.andP;  The reason for this israther straightforward: few of the competitive offerings provide asufficiently compelling reason why existing PageMaker users should switch, orwhy prospective desktop publishers should take the risk of bucking theconventional wisdom and going with a newcomer.andP;  To displace PageMaker, acompetitive product would have to offer an order of magnitude betterprice/performance/features.andP;  Otherwise, market inertia will favor the marketleader.andM;Quark was able to carve out a successful niche for itself based upon itssuperior typographic and color features.andP;  But Aldus has improved itstypography, and it recently announced Color Extensions.andP;  The gap betweenPageMaker and Quark therefore narrows--which could mean trouble for Quark inthe future.andM;What will a Publish-It user not be able to do?andP;  In the beta version we saw,the user could not produce color separations; specify some advancedtypographic controls, such as an optimum word space (the minimum and maximumcan be specified) or the minimum number of characters before or after ahyphen; set up kerning tables (individual kerning is performed interactivelyor through a quickly accessed menu); or allow for precise definitions ofcertain areas, such as text blocks, via a menu (they are defined using themouse and the WYSIWYG display and can be precisely defined after they arecreated).andM;What will the user be able to do?andP;  Rotate anything in 1[deg.] increments(though the screen will only show a box of the correct size at the properangle); shade anything in 1% increments; view up to 100 editable thumbnailviews of pages; set kerning values in 1/256-point increments; expand andcondense type in percentages; choose any of 70-80 stylesheets to design thedocument; choose any of 30-40 patterns with which to fill text; wrap textaround or inside an object; opt for column balancing; search and replace onany of an impressive number of attributes (font, mode, point size, fillpattern, etc); and check spelling (interactively or as a batch operation) andsearch for synonyms.andP;  And that list doesn't include graphics options, whichare impressive.andM;Publish-It 1.1 will contain as many draw and paint features as some dedicatedprograms: freehand drawing, flipping and rotation of graphics, spot colors,Bezier curves, importing of several graphics formats, and all the more commoncapabilities.andP;  A &quot;camera&quot; icon in the composition program lets the userchange any part of a document into a bitmap in order to perform pixel editingor other enhancements.andM;With several months remaining before release, TimeWorks is still polishingthe program; we were heartened by company officials' eagerness to hearsuggestios for improvements.andP;   In some areas, such as advanced typographicfeatures, we are uncertain of what the product will offer because we don'tknow whether some of our suggestions will be incorporated.andP;   But if our firstimpressions are accurate, this definitely looks like a product to watch.andM;Other corners are heard from.andP;  Although the Atari Computer booth was dwarfedby the adjoining IBM stand, i stood squarely between the hall entrance and BgBlue, so passersby who could be lured in for a look were plentiful.andP;  Of thedozen or so applications being shown in the Atari booth's nooks and crannies,four were DTP programs.andM;Atari Computer's own DeskSet II composition program, which runs under GEM andis based on software developed byandM;G.O.andP;   Graphics, is scheduled to be released in late May.andP;  It offersandM;quite decent typographic features: control over the minimum, maximum and&quot;preferred&quot; wordspace, adjustable letterspacing, and control over the numberof consecutive hyphens (the hyphenation dictionary is easily modified).andO;Sixteen Compugraphic Intellifonts are standards, and more will be availablesoon; they are identical on the screen and on output and can be condensed orexpanded.andP;  Text can be automatically flowed around or inside any object, andregions for text to flow into can easily be joined or separated.andP;  Style tagscan be applied locally or globally.andP;  Graphic areas can be blanked out tospeed repainting.andM;At the show, Atari Computer announced a turnkey desktop publishing systembased on its own hardware.andP;  The $3,995 package includes an Atari Mega 4computer with 4 MB of RAM and a 30-MB hard drive; the 300-dpi SLM804-PCV(sharp name!) laser printer running Imagen's PostScript emulator,UltraScript, with 50 fonts; and Timeworks' Desktop Publisher ST software.andP;  Nomonitor is included in the package, which will be available through June 30.andM;A minor upgrade (version 1.09) of ISD Marketing's Calamus program ($299.95)was released at the end of March, as were 84 Compugraphic typefacaes for usewith the program.andP;  Most of the available font families sell for $99.95 each.andO;The company also recently began marketing a Linotronic interface for Calamus.andM;Soft-Logik Publishing announced the imminent release of the first nine fontdisks of a planned series for use with its PageStream program (formerlyPublishing Partner Professional), which runs on both Atari Mega ST andCommodore Amiga computers.andP;  Each volume contains at least three families, ofSoft-Logik's own design, and sells for $39.95.andP;  Version 1.6 of PageStream($199.95) is due in late May.andM;Migraph told us that a PC version of its Touch-Up monochrome graphics editor,which it demonstrated on an Atari computer, is coming in June.andP;  Like theAtari version, it will sell for $180.andM;In the far glitzier Commodore booth, Gold Disk showed Professional Page 1.2,which was being shipped that week.andP;  As of that time the exclusiveCompugraphic font dealer in the Amiga market, Gold Disk will offer the 35LaserWriter Plus fonts with Professional Page 1.3, which is due out thissummer.andP;  The program can now output to the QMS ColorScript 100 printer.andM;Recognizing the growth of OCRandM;The optical character recognition market has matured to the point where newentrants are rare.andP;  Instead, the &quot;old guard&quot; keep improving their productsand trying to seize pieces of the rapidly expanding OCR pie from each other.andM;By now, virtually all of the contenders claim to be able to recognizeproportionally spaced text.andP;  Most include a selection of &quot;pretrained&quot; fontsand a function for teaching the software new fonts.andP;  Superficially, it mightseem that only the less powerful programs would need a user-training process,but because of the variety of documents and typefaces such a process isnearly unavoidable.andP;  Instead of trying to develop completely automaticfunctionality, most vendors are focusing on making the training process asquick and simple as possible.andM;Within another year or so, we expect that all OCR packages except those aimedat lower-end markets will be able to recognize columns, read pages inlandscape mode and handle a large complement of international character sets.andO;Product differentiation will be most obvious in such areas as the ability torecognize layout formats (tables, lists, indents, etc.); the simplicity ofreordering text blocks; the ability to process graphics; the number of&quot;pretrained&quot; fonts and the ease of &quot;training&quot; new ones; and, of course, theaccuracy of character recognition, particularly in reading ligatures, bholdand italic text and very small or very large type, and other problematictasks.andM;OmniPage 2.0.andP;  Caere turned the spotlights on its OmniPage 2.0 release with aplush press breakfast, which was marred only by a pointless half-hour speechfrom a Microsoft representative.andP;  (The only noteworthy item during that talkwas a slide that referred to &quot;OS/2 Presentation Manger(sic).&quot;)andM;There are three versions of OmniPage 2.0: one for the Macintosh ($795), onepackaged with a coprocessor card for MS-DOS machines ($2,495), and one to rununder Windows 386 ($895).andP;  All three are scheduled to be shipped in mid-May.andO;Chief among the new features is the ability to recognize characters and pagesin landscape mode.andP;  Foreign character sets have also been added; the programcan recognize characters used in American or British English, French, German,Spanish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Irish, Italian, Dutch and Portuguese.andM;When we review the leading OCR packages later this year, OmniPage willcertainly be among them.andM;A plethora of advances.andP;  Caere was far from alone in advancing its OCRcapabilities.andP;  Inovatic introduced (and began shipping) ReadStar III Plus($1,995), which built on previous releases of the PC software by offeringcolumn recognition as well as suppression of graphic images and headlines.andO;Another Inovatic product making its debut was ReadStar Ex-Press ($995), anOCR package aimed at the office automation market; unlike its big brother(III Plus), it can operate without being trained by the user, though there isan optional training process.andP;  Ex-Press can read documents in landscapeformat and all European character sets, and it recognizes characters as smallas four points.andP;  It was slated to be shipped in late april.andM;Olduvai announced that it was shipping Read-It O.C.R.andP;  ($495 for '286 and'386 PCs under Windows.andP;  Like Read-It O.C.R.andP;  2.0 for the Macintosh (also$495), it comes with four pretrained fonts (Times, Helvetica, Courier andelite); the user can train it to recognize others.andP;  Olduvai also announcedRead-It O.C.R.andP;  Personal ($195), a version designed for use with handheldscanners, which are enjoying great popularity.andM;In the Flagstaff booth, we saw SPOT 3.0 ($995), due to be shipped in lateApril.andP;  This version of the PC-based program, which divides the scanned pageinto zones that can be manually redefined, contains 11 pretrained fonts(further training can be performed) and is operated with the keyboard or amouse.andM;It supports both left-to-right and right-to-left reading languages, includingArabic, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish, Dutch,Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish.andP;  We'd be interested to see a demonstrationof Arabic, a notoriously difficult language for OCR because of its ligatures.andM;OCR Systems announced ReadRight 2.0 ($495).andP;  This version, which runs on '286and '386 PCs, improves on the preceding one mainly by reading proportionallyspaced text and by recognizing multiple columns (of variable widths), tablesand lists.andP;  In addition to the most common word processing formats, files cannow be saved in Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Excel and Borland Quattro spreadsheetformats.andM;Compulink Management Center showed an interesting use of OCR tecnology: atext and image mangement system that integrates Kurzweil OCR capability and aproprietary text retrieval process.andP;  Its LaserFiche system is built on '386PCs, 300-dpi scanners and laser printers, optical disc drives and systemsoftware.andP;  Many configurations are available.andP;  The system was initiallydevised for lawyers; the entertainment industry (which uses it largely forscript storage) has become another large market.andM;Macdex: not ready for prime timeandM;&quot;Macdex,&quot; the Interface Group's attempt to bring Macintosh-related productsinto what is almost entirely an MS-DOS show, was a dismal failure.andP;  Just askthe attendees who had to part wit ha separate admission fee just to see abare handful of exhibitors.andP;  Or poll the vendors who were stuck in the mostdistant corner of a huge hall, in a curtained-off area, with sparseattendance, and who paid full Comdex booth space fees for the privilege.andP;  Tosay that both groups were foaming with rage would be an understatement.andM;When an interesting corpse is found, trails of suspicion usually lead in manydirections.andP;  Interface Group's intentions were doubtless unimpeachable, butin trade show terms, Macdex was virtually a last-minute idea.andP;  Most of thebig Mac peripheral vendors had already budgeted their exhibit beans, and bigdaddy Apple, a maker or breaker of such expositions, felt no obligation todrop in.andM;Word has it that at Fall Comdex, the Macdex segment will be housedseparately, in Cashman Hall.andP;  The lead time for that show is greater, but theattendees and vendors from the inaugural Macdex are bound to spread wordalong the grapevine to avoid this mistake at all costs.andP;  It the InterfaceGroup doesn't put on a Macdex in Las Vegas that's at least a couple orders ofmagnitude better than this one, the vultures will be circling with confidenceby the time the first attendee shuttle bus arrives at Cashman.andM;The one exciting product we found within the Macdex ghetto was a newcomposition entry from TimeWorks; we have included that review in ourdiscussion of composition software, beginning on page 21.andM;Send in the you-know-whats.andP;  Macdex didn't have Apple, but it had the nextbest thing.andP;  In the MS-DOS world, that would mean a respected, successful,first-rank &quot;compatible-maker&quot; such as Compaq.andP;  But in the monopolisticuniverse of the Mac, it meant a little-heard-of-cloner with a booth barelylarger than professional wrestler King Kong Bundy, whose autograph sessionsdrew about as many attendees into the Headshtart Computer booth at Comdex aswere visiting Macdex at any given time.andM;Akkord, a Taiwanese firm that has shown a Macintosh clone called Jonathan,had working prototypes of its Laptop Upgrade Kit for the Mac.andP;  Three modelswere on display, but only one will be produced; visitors who indicated theirpreferences were determining which model that will be.andM;The kit, which will turn a Mac logic board into a laptop computer, will beannounced next fall.andP;  Rumor has it, though, that by then Apple have unveiledits own long-awaited laptop Mac.andP;  Since Apple's laptop will contain a logicboard, it will certainly cost far more than Akkord's kit; Akkord can onlyhope that Mac owners will be willing to swap the logic board, every time theygo on the road or return to the office, in order to save the difference.andM;Powder Blue Computers did not exhibit in the Macdex area, even though it wasseeking dealers, for its Macintosh-compitable computers.andP;  This Utah firm buysApple ROM and BIOS chips through third parties, thereby avoiding (it hopes)any legal difficulties.andP;  It has been producing Mac-compatibles for 2-1/2years but is just now assembling a dealer network.andM;Powder Blue's BlueMAQ line includes models ranging from one based on a 16-MHz68020 processor to a new one (introduced at Comdex) boasting a 20-MHz 68030and a 68882 coprocessor.andP;  Princeton Graphic Systems grayscale monitors arestandard on all models, as are 4 MB of RAM, a large hard disk and a floppydrive.andM;Powder Blue claims not to want a major share of the Mac market, which isgood.andP;  Like so many other low-budget vendors, it distributes promotionalmaterial that is barely literate and obviously done in haste--not the way toinstill confidence in potential dealers or end users.andP;  And while it undercutsApple's prices, it can't (or won't) match the discounts of 50% or more thanmany IBM clone vendors offer as motivation to forgo the &quot;real thing.&quot;andM;A Mac-compatible laptop?andP;  The most intriguing Apple-related hardwareannouncement came from Atari, which will release in July a laptop computercalled Stacy.andP;  Since it will offer the same functionality as the Atari 1040ST, Stacy will, like that desktop model, be able to run most Macintoshprograms.andP;  The user need merely one of several available Mac emulators forthe Atari line--from suc outfits as the Denver-based company Data Pacific, orGadgets by Small of Littleton, CO--and supplement it with a standard AppleROM.andP;  (Another package, PC Ditto [$89.95] from Avant-Garde of Jacksonville,FL, enables the 1040 ST to run MS-DOS software.)andM;Stacy will run on an 8-MHz Motorola 68C000 CPU.andP;  Its supertwist LCDmonochrome display will show 640 x 400 pixels.andP;  A built-in trackball willserve mouse functions.andP;  The  laptop will cost $1,499 with a double-sidedfloppy and 1 MB of RAM; the 20-MB hard drive version will be about $500 more.andM;Miscellaneous items of interestandM;Laying low the language barrier.andP;  In last spring's Comdex article, wereported on a company called Toltran, which was working on languagetranslation software (see Vol.andP;  2, No.andP;  10, p. 9).andP;  Another contender in thisarena appeared in Chicago: Globalink Language Services, whose productcurrently offers bidirectional translation between French and English as wellas Spanish and English.andP;  Chinese, German, Italian, Portuguese and Russianlanguage pairs are under development.andM;Unlike the pocket-size &quot;traveler's helper&quot; class of devices, these programsoffer not mere word-for-word substitution but actual grammatical conversion,producing sentences with proper syntax.andP;  Although we are still far from theday when technical material and flowery prose alike will be magically,fluently transformed into another language by machine, products such as thesedo produce approximations that are close enough to convey much sense and alittle style.andP;  The potential for use in publishing applications is enormous,beginning with a far quicker and simpler translation process for books andjournals.andM;Globalink demonstrated a variety of languages; within a few minutes, we sawcustomers being shown translations between English and both French andSpanish, and we tried the German-to-English function ourselves.andP;  Ourimpression, and those of the multilingual customers with whom we spoke, wasthat the translated material rated about a B; most of the menaing came acrosswell, but it was occasionally muddled; compound words were ill-treated; andthe program didn't recognize (and therefore brought across in the originallanguage) a few fairly common words, such as the German Halle.andM;Still, this technology shows considerable promise.andP;  Globalink, which is usingmethods devised for the Pentagon, is ahead of where Toltran was last spring;but then again, so is Toltran, judging from the package we just receivedannouncing the release of the latter's Spanish and English modules.andP;  Itshouldn't be long before these firms, or others, sell their technology on anOEM basis to well-known vendors of composition systems or other relevantproducts.andP;  Then the development process should accelerate even more.andM;Graphic word processors blur borders.andP;  As desktop composition software closesthe gap on high-end composition packages, it is being pursued at the lowerend by word processing programs that offer increasing graphics power.andP;  Justas the distinction between &quot;desktop publishing&quot; and other computer publishingcontinues to blur, so does the one between &quot;desktop publishing&quot; and &quot;wordprocessing.&quot;andM;Samna's long-heralded Ami graphic word processor, which runs under Windows,was but one of several competitors in this realm at Comdex.andP;  Marc SoftwareInternational showed its WordMarc Composer+, which is notable for running ona wide range of platforms (it now runs on MS-DOS, Unix, and many minicomputerplatforms) and for its connections to other software (it can import data frommicro- and minicomputer databases and spreadsheets and can incorporate filesfrom Ventura Publisher or Interleaf Publisher).andP;  And Wordcraft (Canada) Ltd.andO;made the North American introduction of Wordcraft Elite, a powerful PC wordprocessing program claimed to fully integrate text and images.andP;  Programs suchas these may soon infringe upon true &quot;desktop publishing&quot; territory.andM;Odesta's document records.andP;  We don't intend to publish an extensive report onthe Odesta Document Management System (ODMS) until we see it in operation atQuad/Graphics or the New York daily News, but at every viewing we pick upsome more intriguing tidbits.andM;In Odesta's hotel suite near Comdex, we saw how easy it is to customizedocument records.andP;  These records serve as  interactive job tickets: they areautomatically updated as the file in question is altered, and the user canmake changes (such as adding comments).andM;ODMS document records are composed on a definable grid.andP;  Simple drawing toolslet the operator create fields for the various types of data.andP;  A field thatis likely to be used in diverse document records can be created outside thedocument record display screen, then saved, after which it will be includedin a list of available record elements.andP;  Any field in that list can be addedto an existing record through a simple mouse procedure.andP;  Icons (e.g., of thefile covered by that record) can also be added to a record.andM;The document record is composed of &quot;intelligent&quot; fields.andP;  For instance, afield can be created that requires a numeric entry; depending on the numberthat the user enters there, the system will take different actions.andP;  If afield asks for the price quoted to a customer for the job in question, it canbe configured to send different messages to the operator depending on whetherthat price is above or below a specified amount.andM;Other product news.andP;  ZSoft introduced PC Paintbrush IV, a significantenhancement of its popular graphics software.andP;  The principal enhancements arein the area of color image processing features, including special effectssuch as blend, smudge, gradient, tiling, tint, brightness and contrast;precise editing of grayscale images; support for both outline and bitmapfonts, plus the ability to format text and to create special text effects(gradient, slant, shadow, outline, etc.) automatically; multilevel,split-screen &quot;zoom&quot; editing; support for TIFF as well as .PCX image fileformats; 256-color VGA support; user-defined palette style sheets; and anexpanded toolbox, plus a &quot;gadget&quot; box for simpler image editing.andM;In a move that suggests that developers are finally beginning to wake up tothe advantages of a common user interface, Paintbrush IV is implemented usingthe Common User Access (CUA) interface standard as exemplified in MicrosoftWindows--even though it doesn't use Windows (a Windows version wil beavailable later).andM;PC Paintbrush IV is priced at $99.95.andP;  Existing Paintbrush users can upgradefor $35.andM;Microlytics told us that the grammar checker it is working on will be soldthrough OEM channels, but it didn't rule out offering the product directly.andO;It intends to make the software available on MS-DOS, OS/2 and Unix platforms.andO;We hope to report on the status of this project when we review the leadinggrammar checking software in an upcoming issue.andM;GST Software Products, which has produced software for companies such asTimeWorks (see page 22), launched a line of matching screen and printerfonts.andP;  The Typografica series, using fonts developed by GST withPostScript-compatible widths, provides font metrics and kerning tables foruse with Ventura Publisher, PC PageMaker and Publish-It PC; it will alsogenerate fonts for any application running under GEM/3 or Windows or using HPSoft Fonts.andP;  Fonts can be condensed or expanded to any width between 25% and200% of the original.andM;The first release will contain GST's versions of the 35 LaserWriter Plusfonts.andP;  Each of the nine packages (generally containing four weights of onetypeface) will cost $49; two discounted multifont packages will be available.andO;Volume shipment is scheduled for May.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
