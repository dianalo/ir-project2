The Tobacco Products Liability Project said that comments by a lawyer for RJR Nabisco Inc. could help smokers to win liability suits, although some attorneys and analysts questioned the legal importance of the information.    RJR immediately denied that it made any admission about health problems. A federal official's recollections of the meeting in a memorandum are &quot;inaccurate, misstate the facts and misrepresent the company's position,&quot; it added.    Liability suits against tobacco companies have had little success to date. About 125 such suits are pending, but they have been dealt major setbacks lately by court rulings limiting the scope of the claims.    Marc Edell, a prominent plaintiffs attorney in tobacco products liability litigation, said the memo &quot;in itself isn't a devastating document&quot; although it &quot;suggests a fruitful area of investigation.&quot;    But securities analysts were relieved that the news wasn't worse. Kurt Feuerman, a tobacco analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., called the news a &quot;nonevent.&quot; And Neal Kaplan, an analyst with Interstate Securities Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., said, &quot;If anything, people went, 'Whew. That's the best they can come up with?'&quot; Tobacco stocks, which declined last week in anticipation of an announcement, gained in trading yesterday.    Still, Richard Daynard, head of the Tobacco Products Liability Project and a law professor at Northeastern University, contended at a news conference in Boston that the alleged admission will help plaintiffs by showing that the tobacco industry privately acknowledges the health hazards of smoking while publicly denying it. &quot;These admissions are highly relevant,&quot; he said.    The alleged admission is detailed in a memo written by Dr. Ronald Davis, director of the federal government's Office on Smoking and Health, about a Sept. 14 meeting. The meeting was held so that RJR representatives could tell federal officials about a new &quot;smokeless&quot; cigarette that was unveiled to the public that day. The cigarette, to be test marketed next year, substantially reduces many regular cigarette smoke compounds, including tar, that are associated with cancer. However, it contains about the same amount of carbon monoxide and nicotine, which are linked to heart disease, strokes, various circulatory problems and complications to unborn children.    Prof. Daynard obtained a copy of the memo after making a request under the Freedom of Information Act.    According to Dr. Davis's memo, Peter Hutt, a Washington lawyer representing RJR, &quot;began by pointing out that the three major health problems related to smoking were cancer, chronic lung disease and heart disease. He stated that the new R.J. Reynolds product, by producing a negligible amount of tar, should provide important health benefits by reducing the risk of cancer in smokers.&quot;    Mr. Hutt, however, in a letter to Dr. Davis, disputed the account. He said he specifically pointed out that his comments about health problems &quot;were allegations by critics . . . that the company (RJR) did not agree with.&quot; Mr. Hutt added that he said at the meeting that RJR doesn't agree that cigarettes are unsafe. </TEXT></DOC>
