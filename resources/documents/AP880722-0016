The rocket was fired without a hitch at 7:12 p.m. EDT Thursdayfrom the launch pad in Kourou, on the northeastern coast of SouthAmerica. It was the 24th launch for Arianespace, the companyresponsible for commercial flights of European rockets, and thefourth this year.   Cloudy weather at the launch site caused a six-minute delay inthe countdown. Moments after the rocket took off, its brilliantorange flame was obscured by the low clouds.   Seventeen minutes after takeoff, the rocket reached the orbitingaltitude of 22,500 miles.   Within four minutes, the two satellites were launched towardstationary positions above the earth. They are ECS-5 for Eutelsat,the European Organization of Satellite Communications, and INSAT-1Cfor the Indian Space Research Organization.   ``We are particularly happy tonight to have successfullylaunched the Indian satellite,'' said Frederic d'Allest, directorof Arianespace.   ``Arianespace has put 11 satellites into orbit in 11 months,''and the company has additional launches scheduled for September,October, November and December, he said. Nine launches are set for1989.   ``There will be no vacation for Ariane,'' he said, adding thatthe rocket to be launched Sept. 7 will carry two more satellitesinto orbit.   Ariane-3 is capable of lifting 2.8 tons into space, compared tothe new generation Ariane-4 rocket which can carry a maximum loadof 4.6 tons. The new, powerful rocket was launched for the firsttime June 15 and carried three satellites into orbit. It isscheduled to blast off again in November.   The versatile Ariane-4, developed at a cost of $575 million,will be used with increasing frequency between November and 1991 tomeet Arianespace's backlog of 42 launch orders.   ECS-5, weighing 2,607 pounds, was constructed jointly by theFrench aerospace and defense giant Matra and British Aerospace. Thesatellite will upgrade long distance telephone service fromPortugal to Finland and Turkey to Ireland during its seven-yearlifespan.   Eutelsat, which groups 26 national telecommunicationsauthorities, had reserved a place on the American Atlas Centaurrocket in case of setbacks in the Arianespace program.   On May 31, 1986, technicians were forced to destroy an Ariane-2rocket shortly after liftoff when a problem in the third-stageignition caused the rocket to go off course. Arianespace suspendedlaunches for 16 months after the failure.   INSAT-1C, constructed by Ford Aerospace, has a lifespan of 10years. It will expand television and long-distance telephoneservice and collect meteorological data.   The 2,618-pound satellite was originally to be carried by anAmerican rocket. But after the failure of the U.S. space shuttleChallenger, Indian authorities decided to put their valuable cargoaboard an Ariane under a contract worth $50 million.   The space shuttle program was grounded after seven astronautswere killed in the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster.   A small leak on the launch pad now threatens to delay thescheduled September launching of the next U.S. space shuttlemission by as much as two months, U.S. officials said. Spaceshuttle Discovery is scheduled to take a crew of five astronautsinto space.   Before the Thursday launch, Pramod Kale, director of ISRO, saidthat for five years telecommunications in India has relied on asingle satellite. The next INSAT satellite is scheduled forlaunching in early 1989 aboard an American Delta rocket.   Kale said that until INSAT-1B was launched in 1983, televisionreached only the larger Indian cities. Now, because of satellitecommunications, 70 percent of the country's population has accessto television.   Arianespace now hauls half the world's commercial payloads andholds launch contracts worth $2.5 billion. Eight launches arescheduled for 1988, with nine launches a year planned beginning in1989.</TEXT></DOC>
