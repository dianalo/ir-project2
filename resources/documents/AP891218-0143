Watkins released Monday.   ``It is still unclear that effective control of the situation byan adequately prepared response team ever took place,'' John F.Ahearne, chairman of the Advisory Committee on Nuclear FacilitySafety, said in a letter to Watkins.   The letter also raised questions about safety and environmentalpractices at Pantex, the nation's only final assembly plant fornuclear bombs and missile warheads.   The committee said the response to the May release of tritium, aradioactive gas, was of ``variable quality.''   Radiation specialists and technicians responded properly tominimize workers' exposure at the plant outside Amarillo, but``missing was recognition that this `unlikely event' could takeplace, and thus adequate procedures, instrumentation, and trainingwere lacking,'' the committee said.   Although a quick and effective evacuation was conducted,thereafter, ``events are marked by confusion, misread instruments,and uncertain actions. There appeared to be no plan to handle whatsurely must be an anticipated accident.''   Exposure to workers was below federal guidelines limitingradiation explosure and ``off-site exposure was trivial.''   A team of government and outside experts recently inspected theplant and found Pantex would be unable to respond effectively toemergencies involving releases of radioactive material.   Watkins said those findings indicate workers lack adequateprotection from emergency and rountine exposures to radioactivereleases and that the situation must be corrected immediately.   Pantex spokesman Tom Walton said the plant had begun correctingproblems, or ``will be addressing those in the very near future.''Some safety violations were corrected immediately, he said.   ``We of course are already looking at those things they'veidentified and in areas that we need to improve, obviously, we'regoing to make improvements,'' Walton said.   Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators, whoalso inspected the plant, found more than 300 safety violations,dozens of them serious.</TEXT></DOC>
