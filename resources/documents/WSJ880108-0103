This week's production decline indicates that car makers are moving forward with plans to build 14% fewer cars in the first quarter of 1988. The eight major auto makers didn't produce any cars last week because of the holidays.    Chrysler Corp. said it will add a second shift Monday at its Belvidere, Ill., plant, following conversion of the plant to handle assembly of new full-sized Chrysler New Yorker, New Yorker Landau and Dodge Dynasty four-door sedans. The second shift will employ about 1,400 workers who had been laid off. Chrysler spent $367 million to modernize the Belvidere plant.    Seven General Motors Corp. plants remained idle this week, with the Framingham, Mass., plant closed indefinitely, as previously reported. GM has scheduled overtime shifts tomorrow at its Baltimore truck plant and for postal vehicle production at its Moraine, Ohio, truck plant. GM's Pontiac, Mich., West plant, which builds Blazer and Jimmy sport utility trucks, will be closed until Jan. 18 for installation of a new engine line.    Ford Motor Co. scheduled two eight-hour overtime shifts tomorrow at its Kansas City, Mo., plant, which builds Tempo and Topaz cars, and at its Wixom, Mich., plant, which assembles luxury cars.    Volkswagen of America Inc.'s Westmoreland, Pa., plant reopens Jan. 18. The unit of Volkswagen AG, a West German car maker, has announced it will close the plant permanently this year.    ---              This     Last   Yr.
