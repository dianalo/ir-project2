ROTSTEIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States' uranium industry iscritically ailing, but the possibility for some recovery exists,according to one uranium company official.   ``I'm convinced that the U.S. industry is nonviable,'' James W.Sanguinetti, director of uranium marketing for Freeport UraniumCo., said Tuesday in addressing a national industry seminar duringa three-day meeting. ``The fact that annual production has declinedover 70 percent since 1980 and that exploration dollars havedeclined over 90 percent is indicative of an ailing, if not dying,industry.''   Howard L. Walton of the Energy Department's Energy InformationAdministration said production of uranium, the fuel source fornuclear energy, totaled about 13 million pounds last year, withabout 8.5 million coming from conventional mining methods. Similaroutput is expected this year, compared with peak production of 43.7million pounds in 1980, he said.   Canada, the world's largest producer, totaled 32.4 millionpounds in 1987.   Walton also noted that in 1987:   _Industry employment was at its lowest level since thegovernment began keeping statistics.   _Surface drilling footage for uranium development andexploration was 1.96 million feet, down 5 percent from 1986 andonly 4 percent of the peak recorded for 1978.   _Aggregate industry assets were down by more than 55 percentbetween 1982 and 1987, from $3.6 billion to $1.6 billion, as firmsgot out of the uranium business or wrote down assets.   Walton said Arizona, Texas and Wyoming accounted for 77 percentof the total surface drilling in 1987 _ 22 percent, 25 percent and30 percent respectively.   Sanguinetti said about 90 percent of the uranium consumed in theUnited States was bought under long-term contracts, with pricesroughly ranging from $30 to $35 a pound. The remainder is bought onthe spot market, with current prices of about $14 a pound, he said.   But Sanguinetti said inventories are diminishing too. ``We aregetting close to balance, but we haven't reached it yet,'' he said.   Sanguinetti said he thinks the market price has bottomed andwill show some improvement as the impending demand is felt.   Utility managers are under tremendous pressure to reduceoperating and maintenance costs and to take advantage of fuelprices in the depressed spot market, he said. But continuation ofsuch policies will expose the utilities to volatile pricing thatwill be inevitable as supplies and inventories decline, he said.   Sanguinetti also said that as the number of operational nuclearplants increases, along with their efficiency, demand for uraniumwill increase.   He predicted a potential for producing about 20 million pounds ayear if prices reach about $20 a pound and about 32 million pounds,or 80 percent of America's demand, at $30 a pound.   ``The higher the price, the more viable producers there are,''Sanguinetti said. ``In the United States, because of the abundanceof reserves, viability is a function of price. At some point, thewhole industry will be declared viable again because of its abilityto supply a significant quantity of uranium.''</TEXT></DOC>
