The review seeks to determine the impact of Commission participationin the reorganization process and to determine the most appropriate rolefor the Commission's bankruptcy program. The object of this review is tohelp to provide an informed basis upon which to reassess the Commission'srole in such proceedings and also to consider whether there is a need forlegislation.In this release, the Commission seeks comments on specific questions relatingto the appropriate scope and nature of the Commission's participation inChapter 11 reorganizations. In particular, the Commission invites the viewsof the bankruptcy bench and bar and others concerning whether or not Commissionsection 1109(a) participation aids in the fair and efficient resolutionof chapter 11 cases. In that connection, interested persons are asked toaddress the impact of that participation on public investors and also howit affects other parties to chapter 11 reorganization cases, such as nonpubliccreditors employees, and others. A related area of inquiry is the extentto which the interests of public investors are sufficiently protected inreorganziation cases through the activities of U.S. Trustees, officialinvestor committees, indenture trustees, institutional investors, or otherentities. Finally, the Commission invites public comment on the desirabilityof legislative change with respect to its section 1109(a) role in bankruptcyreorganization, and with respect to other mechanisms for the protectionof public security holders. The Commission anticipates that the responsesto these questions will be helpful in framing its future role under section1109(a).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>Commission Role in Corporate Reorganization Proceedings<ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Chandler Act of 1938</ITAG>The Commission's participation in reorganization cases began in 1938 withpassage of the Chandler Bankruptcy Act.1<NOTE/> Under that Act, a financially troubled business seeking toreorganize its affairs while continuing operations could file for reorganizationgenerally under chapter X or chapter XI. Reorganizations under chapterX affected both secured and unsecured creditors as well as stockholders.A chapter XI arrangement could affect only the claims of unsecured creditors.2<NOTE/> Congress required prior court approval of a chapter X reorganizationplan as to its fairness 3<NOTE/> and feasibility before permitting solicitation of acceptancesfrom affected classes of creditors and stockholders. In contrast, the formulationof a plan of arrangement under chapter XI was in the control of the debtor;and a plan was confirmed unless it failed to meet the ``best interest ofcreditors'' standard, <T3>i.e., </T3>that creditors receive more under the plan than they wouldin a liquidation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>1 The Chandler Act was passed following a congressionallydirected study conducted by the Commission into the abuses of protectiveand reorganization committees. ``Report of the Securities and ExchangeCommission on the Study and Investigation of the Work, Activities, Personneland Functions of Protective and Reorganization Committees'' (1937).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>2 In enacting Chapter X, Congress sought ``to afford greaterprotection to creditors and stockholders by providing greater judicialcontrol over the entire proceedings and impartial and expert administrativeassistance in corporate reorganizations through appointment of a disinterestedtrustee and the active participation of the SEC.'' <T3>Securities and Exchange Commission </T3>v. <T3>American Trailer Rentals Co., </T3>379 U.S. 594, 604 (1965).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>3 The requirement that a reorganization plan could not beconfirmed by the court unless it was found to be ``fair and equitable''incorporated the so-called strict priority standard, under which creditorsand stockholders participated in the plan strictly in accordance with theirlegal priorities. Stockholders could not participate at all unless theclaims of creditors were statisfied in full with interest.The Commission's responsibilities under the Chandler Act in chapter X caseswere two-fold.\4\<NOTE/> First, the Commission furnished advice to the court and investorsby examining and reporting on the fairness and feasibility of reorganizationplans (the ``Advisory Report''). Under section 172 of chapter C, the judge,before confirming a plan, was required to submit to the Commission, forexamination and an advisory report, all plans ``worthy of consideration''involving a debtor with liabilities in excess of $3 million. Second, theCommission was granted general authority to participate on behalf of publicinvestors in all matters.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The Commission reviewed cases filed under chapter XI toensure that the investor protections found in chapter X were not circumventedby a debtor filing under chapter XI of the Act. Section 328 of former chapterXI specifically authorized the Commission to make application to the courtto transfer a chapter XI proceeding to chapter X.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Pursuant to section 208 of chapter X, the Commission wasdeemed to be a party in interest, but could not initiate an appeal.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Bankruptcy Code of 1978</ITAG>The Bankruptcy Code, which became effective October 1, 1979, consolidatedthe various reorganization provisions of the old Bankruptcy Act, includingchapters X and XI, into chapter 11. Chapter 11 encourages negotiation ofa consensual plan of reorganization between a debtor and those creditorsand stockholders whose claims and interests are to be compromised. Unlikethe procedure under old chapter X, where an independent trustee was appointedto be the focal point of the reorganization, in new chapter 11 the debtor(<T3>i.e., </T3>existing management) typically remains in possession duringthe pendency of the reorganization proceeding and is granted a period oftime during which it exclusively may propose a plan. Interested partiesnegotiate with the debtor through official committees. Once a plan is proposed,approval is solicited through a ``disclosure statement,'' which substitutesin effect for a Securities Act registration statement and Exchange Actproxy statement if securities are issued under the plan.\6\<NOTE/> Under chapter 11, a plan need not be ``fair'' in the absolutepriority sense, if each class affected (or ``impaired'') by the plan votesto approve it.\7\<NOTE/> According to Congress, the premise underlying the chapter11 standard for confirmation is ``the same as the premise of the Federalsecurities law:'' that once parties are given adequate disclosure of allrelevant information they should be able to make an informed decision asto whether to accept a proposed reorganization plan.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 11 U.S.C. 1125(d), 1145. Where the solicitation involvesbad faith or fraud, the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws wouldbe applicable.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A ``fairness'' concept, similar to the ``fair and equitable''rule of chapter X, is preserved under the present statute only in thosesituations where at least one class has voted to accept the plan and anotherclass rejects it. In that instance, the plan proponent may invoke the so-called``cramdown'' provision (section 1129(b)) to seek court approval of theplan notwithstanding the objection of the rejecting class.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ H.R. Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 224 (1977).One of the major changes effected by the Bankruptcy Code was the adventof official committees, whose expenses and professional fees are paid asan administrative expense of the estate, to represent the various constituentinterests. The Code mandates the appointment of an official committee torepresent the interests of unsecured creditors; other committees may, inthe discretion of the court, be appointed to represent the interests ofequity holders or other constituencies.\9\<NOTE/> Representation by an official committee was deemed essentialto participation in the formulation of a plan in light of the emphasison the formulation of a consensual plan in lieu of adherence to the absolutepriority standard.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Under old chapter X, committees were unofficial and responsiblefor their own expenses and professional fees unless they could demonstatea benefit to the administration of the case. Committees actively representingequity interests were rare.The Bankruptcy Code abolished the requirement that the court submit reorganzationplans to the Commission for examination and an advisory report in orderto expedite the reorganization process. Section 1109(a) maintained theCommission's general authority to participate in corporate reorganizations,granting the Commission the right to ``raise and * * * appear and be heardon any issue in a case.'' Additionally, the Bankruptcy Code no longer requires,as chapter X did, a request for or leave of court for the Commission toaddress an issue in a case.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Commission practice in corporate reorganization cases</ITAG>a. <T3>Commission participation prior to 1984. </T3>Under chapter X of theprior Bankruptcy Act, the Commission usually participated only in casesinvolving large public companies. The Commission viewed the filing of anappearance as imposing a responsibility actively to participate in a case.In implementing this policy, Commission counsel attended committee meetings,key court hearings and informational meetings held by the trustee, andparticipated in discussions and negotiations about matters arising in thecase. The premise underlying these activities was that, by understandingthe dynamics of a case, the debtor's prospects for reorganization, andthe business problems that caused its failure, the staff could react knowledgeablyand expeditiously to issues as they arose. In addition, the Commissionusually participated in the process of making an adequate record in courtas to the debtor's financial fitness and its prospects for reorganizationso that it could later render an advisory report on proposed plans of reorganizationon an informed basis. The Commission's presence in these cases served asan invitation to the parties informally to seek the staff's views beforematters were formally submitted to the bankruptcy court. Responses to theserequests frequently led to consensual resolution.Under old chapter X, the Commission did not participate on every key question,but focused primarily on protecting the rights of public investors andattempting to secure uniformity in judicial construction of the statute.The Commission was also active in advising the courts concerning the compensationof court appointees.From the effective date of the new Code in 1979 until the end of 1983,the Commission continued to perform its general participatory role in muchthe same way as it had under the prior law. During the first four yearsin which the Code was in effect, approximately 250 debtors with publiclyissued securities outstanding filed chapter 11 petitions. The Commissionactively participated in 79, or about 32%, of the filed cases.\10\<NOTE/> In those proceedings the Commission participated on a widerange of issues, including the appointment of trustees and examiners, interimcompensation, employment of professionals, use of property, appointmentof shareholder and creditor committees, administrative expenses, and confirmationissues.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Commission Annual Reports 1980-1983 and the staff's publiccompany list. b. <T3>The Commission's current program.</T3> In 1983, Commissioner BevisLongstreth conducted a study of the Commission's participation in reorganizationcases in light of the comprehensive changes under the Bankruptcy Code.The study concluded that the Commission should alter then existing practicesby curtailing its active participation in reorganization cases. The reportinterpreted the Code's silence regarding the manner in which the Commissionwas to perform its section 1109(a) role as conferring on the Commissiondiscretion in defining its participation in reorganization cases.\11\<NOTE/> It recommended that the Commission focus on legal questionsof precedential significance to public investors generally and respondto judicial requests for assistance.\12\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ The report concluded that ``the SEC has an optional,rather than a mandatory, role to play in bankruptcy proceedings.'' Reportat 3. Thus, the report asserted that the Commission ``should depend uponits own informed sense of the benefits to be derived'' from its participationin determining how to perform its section 1109(a) role. <T3>Id.</T3> at 4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The report also concluded that the Commission shouldno longer review and comment on the appropriate amount of fees to be awardedto parties to a reorganization case. Such fact intensive issues requiresubstantial resources and, the report said, are better left to the courtsand to the U.S. Trustees who exercise direct oversight on such matters.The conclusion that the program should be significantly curtailed was basedin part on the belief that the Commission could reduce its own resourcecommitment in the reorganization area and rely on the combined effortsof the (then new) U.S. Trustees and of official shareholder committeesto protect the interests of the investing public. Accordingly, the studyrecommended that the Commission restructure its existing program, usingthe Commission's participation as <T3>amicus curiae</T3> in private securities litigation as a model forits general participatory role in reorganization proceedings. The Commissionadopted this recommendation in December 1983. Subsequently, the staff hasadministered the bankruptcy program in accordance with a series of staffguidelines \13\<NOTE/> that emphasize participation on significant legal issuesof precedential value to investors generally.\14\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ See Corporate Reorganization Release No. 331 (Feb. 2,1984) 29 SEC Docket 1181.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The 1983 revision left unchanged the manner in whichthe Commission comments on plan disclosure statements and reviews reorganizationplans to assure compliance with Securities Act registration provisions.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission staff reviews disclosure statements to determine whetherthe issuance of securities under a plan is consistent with the exemptionfrom registration in the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise in compliance withthe federal securities laws. The Commission also reviews disclosure statementsto determine whether there is adequate disclosure concerning the proposedplan. Generally, the Commission seeks to resolve questions concerning bankruptcydisclosure through staff comments to the plan proponent. If questions cannotbe resolved through this process, the Commission may file objections tothe disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">During fiscal year 1988, the Commission commented on disclosure statementsin 83 cases and objected to disclosure statements in two cases. The Commissionalso acts to assure that public investors are given an adequate opportunityto be heard on disclosure-related questions. </ITAG>Since January 1984, the Commission has participated in the resolution ofsuch issues in 32 cases at all court levels, including the United StatesSupreme Court. To identify significant legal issues, the Commission filesnotices of appearance in most public company cases in order to receivemailed copies of pleadings. The Commission's legal staff does not activelyparticipate (<T3>i.e.,</T3> does not attend informational meetings, committee meetings,or key court hearings) in reorganization cases and ordinarily takes noposition on issues significant only to the particular case. However, theCommission has sought the appointment of an equity holder committee incases in which it believed such a committee necessary to assure the adequaterepresentation of public investors.\15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Since January 1984, the Commission sought or supportedthe appointment of investor committees in 33 cases, or about 12% of thecases in which the Commission filed a notice of appearance. The Commissiondoes not seek the appointment of an investor committee in every case involvinga public company. Generally, the Comission takes the position that separatestockholder representation is not appropriate in cases in which the debtoris so hopelessly insolvent that liquidation appears likely or where theassets of the debtor are completely pledged and investor interests arelikely to be extinguished. Among the factors that the Commission considersin determining whether to seek the appointment of an official committeeare the value of the equity as publicly reported by the issuer, the goingconcern or inherent value (if realistically higher), the likelihood ofreorganization, the extent of management holdings of common stock, thedegree to which incumbent management can be relied on to represent adequatelyinvestor interests, and the asset size of the debtor.The Commission's participation with respect to legal issues of generalsignificance has played a role in the development of bankruptcy law. Forexample, the Commission has successfully supported stockholders' rightsto corporate governance,\16\<NOTE/> rights of securities fraud claimants to adequate notice ofthe claims bar date,\17\<NOTE/> and the ability of class representatives to file claims inbankruptcy on behalf of similarly situated claimants.\18\<NOTE/> The Commission's participation on these legal issues hasgenerally been at the appellate rather than the bankruptcy court level.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>In re Johns-Manville Corp.</T3>, Corporate Reorganization Release No.356 (May 28, 1986), 35 SEC Docket 1402 and 801 F.2d 60 (2d Cir. 1986) (adoptingCommission position); <T3>In re Allegheny International, Inc.,</T3> Corporate ReorganizationRelease No. 376 (July 20, 1988), 41 SEC Docket 770.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>In re Standard Metals Corp.</T3>, Corporate Reorganization ReleaseNo. 365 (May 22, 1987), 38 SEC Docket 827 and 839 F.2d 1383 (10th Cir.1987) (adopting Commission position).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>See, e.g., In re The Charter Co.,</T3> Corporate Reorganization ReleaseNo. 375 (July 1, 1988), 41 SEC Docket 566 and 876 F.2d 866 (11th Cir. 1985)(adopting Commission position); <T3>In re American Reserve Corp.,</T3> Corporate Reorganization ReleaseNo. 366 (May 22, 1987), 38 SEC Docket 829 and 840 F.2d 487 (7th Cir. 1988)(adopting Commission position); <T3>but see In re Standard Metals Corp.,</T3> Corporate ReorganizationRelease No. 348 (Aug. 14, 1985), 33 SEC Docket 1425 and 817 F.2d 625 (10thCir.)

Request for Comment </ITAG>The Commission is again reviewing its section 1109(a) role in Chapter 11reorganization cases and is also studying the functioning and nature ofpublic investor protections under that chapter. The Commission seeks publiccomment on three general subject areas:<ITAG tagnum="25">_To what extent would the Commission's more active participation contributeto a fair, efficient, and effective resolution of chapter 11 proceedings,and to what extent would participation by the Commission affect the rightsof non-investors or impede the resolution of cases by adding delay andcosts to the process?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Should the Commission play a more active section 1109(a) role onbehalf of investors in reorganization cases, rather than limit its involvementto its present amicus-type role?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Should the Commission propose legislative changes concerning itssection 1109(a) role in reorganizations or in the statutory protectionsfor public investors?</ITAG>The Commission requests that commentators be as specific as possible and,where appropriate, that they provide quantitative data and cite to thesource of the data. The Commission also invites commentators to addressany other matters that they believe relevant to the study.A. To what extent would the Commission's more active participation contributeto a fair, efficient, and effective resolution of chapter 11 proceedings,and to what extent would participation by the Commission affect the rightsof non-investors or impede the resolution of cases by adding delay andcosts to the process? The Commission recognizes that its active participation may have an impacton the bargaining positions of competing claimants in a chapter 11 case,especially in strengthening the position of public investors. Indeed, dependingon the issue, the Commission's involvement may have the effect of increasingthe ultimate distribution received by public investors at the expense ofother parties to the case. Is such participation on behalf of investorsunfair to other parties to the case, such as employees, commercial lenders,trade creditors, tort claimants, and others with claims against the debtor?If so, how should this consideration enter into the Commission's determinationwhether to participate in a proceeding? Participation may also have the effect of protracting the proceedings orrequiring the payment of fees for professional services or the expenditureof other monies that might otherwise be available to satisfy claims ofcreditors. On the other hand, Commission participation may result in anincrease in the value of the estate available for distribution among allclaimants.\19\<NOTE/> The Commission requests that commentators address whetheractive Commission participation contributes to a fair and effective resolutionof chapter 11 proceedings: Does such participation tend to benefit generalcreditor interests? Or does it impede the resolution of the case, addingtime and costs to the process? Does such participation tend to increaseor decrease the size of the estate or to reallocate the estate to publicinvestor classes? How should the Commission take these factors into considerationin deciding whether and how to participate? <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ For example, Commission participation on applicationsby debtors to sell substantial assets of the estate may increase the valueof the estate.Companies that have filed for reorganization will occasionally have classesof public securityholders with adverse interests. For example, holdersof publicly traded debt instruments may have interests adverse to thoseof preferred stockholders, and both those constituencies may have interestsadverse to those of the company's common stockholders. How should the Commission'sparticipation be influenced, if at all, by the potential for conflict amongthe holders of various types of publicly traded securities? Under whichcircumstances should the Commission seek the appointment of separate committeesfor holders of different types of publicly traded securities?B. Should the Commission play a more active section 1109(a) role on behalfof investors in reorganization cases, rather than limit its involvementto its present amicus type role? As described above, in 1983 the Commission significantly curtailed itsgeneral participatory role in reorganization cases under chapter 11. Thischange had the effect of shifting the Commission's participation away froman active bankruptcy court practice on a wide range of factual and legalissues that affect the rights of public investors or the reorganizationprocess itself. Under the current program, the Commission's practice inthis area is limited to <T3>amicus</T3> type participation on significant legal issues. In assessing the direction the program should take in the future, the Commissioninvites commentators to address whether or not there presently is a needfor greater Commission participation in bankruptcy cases. In this connection,the Commission requests information and data on whether other participantsin a chapter 11 case provide adequate representation to shareholder andother public investor interests, thereby obviating the need for a moreactive Commission presence. Certain participants that may fulfill thisrole in whole or in part are discussed below. The Code specifically providesfor some of these participants. Others, drawn to the process by economicself-interest, may provide indirect representation for or advance the interestsof public investors, by virtue of actions taken in their own interests.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Investor Committees </ITAG>As noted, one of the major changes under the Bankruptcy Code was the creationof the official committee system. An official committee for unsecured creditorsis mandated in all Chapter 11 cases, and additional committees may be appointedto represent other constituencies, such as bondholders or shareholders.The U.S. Trustee is granted authority to appoint additional committees.In cases in which the U.S. Trustee determines not to appoint an additionalcommittee, the bankruptcy court has authority to direct the U.S. Trusteeto do so. Actual committee membership is left to the discretion of theU.S. Trustee.According to the drafters of the Code, committees are to serve as ``theprimary negotiating bodies for the formulation of the plan of reorganization.''\2\\0\<NOTE/> Congress intended that committees represent and protect theinterests of the various classes of creditors and equity security holdersfrom which they are selected and provide supervision of the debtor in possession.\2\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\H.R. Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 401 (1977).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\<T3>Id.</T3>The Commission's observations of investor committee practices do not provideclear evidence of whether the committee structure is effective in protectingthe interests of public securities holders. In some cases, it appears thatcommittees are not formed or are unable, either because of internal conflictsor delays in organizing or for other reasons, to deal apropriately withcritical issues. In other cases, multiple committees are active and appearto participate meaningfully. The Commission invites commentators to addressthe value of the committee system in protecting investors. In cases inwhich investor committees are formed, do they function effectively?The Commission also seeks information on whether committees representingpublic investors' interests are appointed where appropriate. As noted above,U.S. Trustees have the authority, on their own initiative, to appoint committeesto represent the interests of public investors. In practice, do the U.S.Trustees appoint committees to represent those interests in appropriatecases?In certain cases in which it appears to the Commission staff that shareholdersmay have an economic interest in the reorganization, no one has soughtappointment of an equity committee. The Commission wishes to explore thereason why committees are not formed in some cases where certain evidencesuggests that equity holders may have a meaningful economic stake in thedebtor. Are investors generally aware of their right to seek formationof an official committee to represent their interests? The Commission staffhas informed the Commission that frequently there is an absence of publiclyavailable financial information about corporations undergoing reorganization.Does this lack of current financial information deter persons from seekingformation of a committee, or are other factors predominately responsiblefor that decision? Alternatively, investors may have determined that thecosts of seeking committee formation and participating in committee activitiesare not justified by the likely rewards. Does the failure of investorsto seek a committee represent an informed decision of this nature?As pointed out above, the Commission has moved or supported motions forthe appointment of investor committees in about 12% of the cases whereit has appeared. But the Commission has not sought a committee in everycase meeting its criteria for appointment (see footnote 15, page 12 above).Are the Commission's general standards for determining whether to seekthe appointment of additional investor committees appropriate? Should theCommission become more active by seeking the formation of investor committees?In contrast, the Commission recognizes that its efforts to encourage committeeformation in cases in which no equity investor has sought a committee mayhave imposed costs on the estate which could otherwise have been avoided.Are such costs justified by increased returns to public investors? If so,are those returns obtained at the expense of other constituencies involvedin the proceeding, or do they reflect an increase in value resulting fromthe Commission's participation? Accordingly, should the Commission be lessactive in seeking formation of investor committees?The Commission staff reports that in some cases, even when an investorcommittee is authorized early in the case, there are significant delaysin the actual appointment of the committee's members, thus delaying thefunctioning of the committee in the case. The Commission solicits commentson the reasons for this phenomenon and what steps, if any, the Commissionshould take to remedy this problem. Is the delay in part caused by a difficultyin finding investors willing to serve on a committee or a reluctance byinvestors to serve on committees? Should the U.S. Trustee, or the Commission,take some action to speed the process of committee formation? The staffhas observed in some cases that investors refrain from accepting membershipon a committee because of a concern that such membership would result inaccess to nonpublic information which, in turn, would inhibit the investors'ability to trade in the debtor's securities. Are potential securities tradingrestrictions for committee members considered a significant impedimentto accepting membership on an official committee? To what extent, if any,can or should the Commission change its own rules or procedures to addressthose concerns?<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Management (the debtor in possession)</ITAG>Unlike prior Chapter X, under which a trustee was appointed automaticallyin all large cases, Chapter 11 leaves debtor's current management in controlof the proceedings with an initial exclusive right to file a reorganizationplan.\2\\2\<NOTE/> One commentator has noted that the Code has made stockholdersmuch more dependent on management to negotiate a plan that protects theirinterests, because a Chapter 11 plan can modify, dilute or even canceltheir interests without their consent.\2\\3\<NOTE/> The staff has observed that in some cases management is morelikely to look after the interests of shareholders when management ownsa substantial amount of the outstanding common stock. On the other hand,the staff has found that management may have a potential conflict of interestin that it may also seek to negotiate for its own continued services afterreorganization. Under what circumstances can shareholders rely on managementto represent their interests? Of course, levels of management equity ownershipvary widely among public companies. Should the percentage of equity ownedby management influence the Commission in determining whether to participatein a particular proceeding?

Indenture Trustees</ITAG>The Bankruptcy Code grants indenture trustees party-in-interest statusand the right to file claims on behalf of all debtholders. In practice,indenture trustees sit on the mandatory unsecured creditors committee eitheras a full voting member or in an <T3>ex-officio</T3> status (non-voting). Indenture trustees do not havea clearly defined role in chapter 11 cases but rather, pursuant to theTrust Indenture Act of 1939, must exercise the same degree of care andskill as a ``prudent person'' would exercise in the conduct of the person'sown affairs.\2\\5\<NOTE/> The Commission requests that commentators address whetherthey believe indenture trustees effectively represent the interests ofdebtholders in reorganization cases.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ <T3>See</T3> Dunham andamp; Borowitz, <T3>The Role of the Indenture Trustee in Reorganization Cases Under theBankruptcy Code, </T3>102 Banking L.J. 436 (1985).Under the Bankruptcy Code, as carried forward from prior chapter X, indenturetrustees may receive payment for fees and expenses directly out of theassets of the debtor's estate, if they can demonstrate that their servicesmade a ``substantial contribution'' to the estate. In some cases, however,indenture trustees have found it difficult to establish that their services,under the legal test employed, made a substantial contribution to the estate.\2\\6\<NOTE/> In such situations, it is the bondholder who ultimately paysfor the indenture trustee's services, pursuant to standard provisions oftrust indentures qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Is this``substantial contribution'' standard of compensation an impediment touseful participation of indenture trustees in chapter 11 cases?<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ <T3>See, e.g., In re Flight Transportation Corp. Securities Litigation,</T3>874 F.2d 576 (8th Cir. 1989); <T3>In re Multiponics, Inc., </T3>622 F.2d 731 (5th Cir. 1980); <T3>In re Baldwin-United Corp., </T3>79 B.R. 321 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 1987).In an appeal to the district court in <T3>Baldwin,</T3> the Commission set forth its views as to the appropriatelegal standard for testing whether an indenture trustee has made a ``substantialcontribution'' in a Chapter 11 case. <T3>See</T3> Corporate Reorganization Release No. 370 (Feb. 22, 1988),40 SEC Docket 565. The district court did not decide the issue; the appealwas dismissed after a settlement provided that the indenture trustee wouldreceive payment of its entire fee request.In many chapter 11 cases there is more than one outstanding issue of publiclyheld debt. Often these issues are subordinated to senior bank debt, orone public debt issue is subordinated to another. Under what circumstancesshould a separate official committee be appointed to represent a classof publicly held debt? Should indenture trustees or the Commission seekto form separate public debtholder committees?<ITAG tagnum="81">4. U.S. Trustees</ITAG>The U.S. Trustee program represents a major modification of pre-Code reorganizationpractice. The U.S. Trustees perform a variety of functions previously assumedby the bankruptcy court. What role do the U.S. Trustees play in protectingthe interests of public investors in chapter 11 reorganization proceedings?<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Institutional Investors</ITAG>Institutional investors, including both private and public pension funds,frequently hold large quantities of stocks or bonds of companies that havefiled for reorganization. While historically such institutions often soldtheir securities when the companies filed for bankruptcy, recently somehave chosen to hold their securities and to become active participantsin the reorganization process through service on equity security holders'committees or unsecured creditors' committees. How active are institutionalinvestors in reorganization cases? When institutional investors are active,does their participation operate to protect the interests of other (non-institutional)public investors?Last year, the Commission's staff met with representatives of the Councilof Institutional Investors (``Council'') to discuss a problem that theCouncil believed tended to discourage pension funds from actively participatingin chapter 11 cases. The Council expressed concern that the Commission'sinsider trading rules effectively prevent pension funds from serving onan equity committee because they may become privy to material non-publicinformation about the reorganization, inhibiting institutions from engagingin ordinary trading strategies in derivative securities that may includethe debtor's stock. To address this problem, the Council suggested thatthe Commission consider adopting a rule or release extending CommissionRule 14e-3(b), 17 CFR 240.14e-3(b), in order to approve the use of ``Chinesewalls'' to avoid potential liability for securities trading decisions madeby an institution's trading department while the institution is participatingon a committee and has access to non-public information. Would promulgationof such a rule or release by the Commission encourage greater institutionalparticipation on committees? Should the Commission consider other measuresto address the concern identified by the Council? If so, which measuresshould be considered?<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Funds specializing in securities of distressed companies</ITAG>It has been reported that, in the past year, funds specializing in securitiesof distressed companies, generally known as ``recovery'' or ``vulture''funds, have raised from $300 million to $500 million to invest primarilyin debt but also to a limited extent in equity securities of corporationsundergoing reorganization.\27\<NOTE/> One commentator has referred to a $3 billion ``pool'' availablefor investment in securities of companies in bankruptcy.\28\<NOTE/> The evolution of funds that specialize in the securitiesof distressed enterprises has attracted supporters and critics. Supportersclaim that, with substantial funds now available for the purchase of distressedsecurities, the discount from face value has narrowed substantially, resultingin a more efficient market with higher stock and bond prices. If so, thesmall public investor may benefit from the participation of these fundsbecause their presence helps support the price of securities issued bydebtor firms.\29\<NOTE/> Critics complain, however, that, if the bankruptcy processwere more effective in representing the interests of public security holdersto begin with, the price of securities might not decline as steeply inthe wake of bankruptcy and that the profit opportunities for funds specializingin distressed enterprises would not be as great.\30\<NOTE/> They complain that it is the small investor who typicallysells his securities early in the bankruptcy process and who loses moneyas a result of the steep decline in the price of the securities.\31\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See Preying on the Busted</T3>, Economist at 86, 88, May 13, 1989;Rohrer, <T3>Jumping on the Bankruptcy Bandwagon</T3>, 23 Institutional Investorsat 84, July 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>Preying on the Busted, supra</T3> note 27, at 86.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 88.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Linden, <T3>The Big Money in Busted Bonds,</T3> Fortune at 100-104, Feb. 15, 1988.A similar phenomenon has been reported with regard to the purchase of tradeclaims. <T3>See</T3> Fanning, <T3>A Stacked Deck?</T3> Forbes at 126, June 12, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>The Big Money in Busted Bonds, supra</T3> note 30.The Commission is interested in learning about the impact of these fundson the reorganization process. How do the recovery funds affect the interestsof public securityholders? Do such funds participate in the committee processor propose or back reorganization plans that might advance the interestsof some or all public investors? The literature tends to suggest that therecovery funds are interested primarily in the larger bankruptcy cases.Are such funds also active in the medium or small size public-company Chapter11 case? On what basis do such funds decide to participate in specificproceedings?C. Should the Commission propose legislative changes concerning its section1109(a) role in reorganizations or in the statutory protections for publicinvestors?As noted above, chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code grants the Commissionthe right to ``raise and * * * appear and be heard on any issue in a case.''The Code does not, however, specify the kind of role the Commission shouldplay, but appears to leave to the Commission discretion to determine howbest to foster investor protection through its participation in corporatereorganizations. Is a legislative amendment clarifying the Commission'ssection 1109(a) role necessary or desirable?With regard to the Code's official committee structure, only the generalunsecured creditors' committee is mandatory. Other official committeescan be appointed to represent public investor classes_senior debentureholders,subordinated debentureholders, preferred shareholders, common shareholders_inthe discretion of the U.S. Trustee or the bankruptcy court. The standardused to determine whether other official committees will be formed looksto whether those committees are needed to assure adequate representation.Does this legal standard_i.e., the need to assure adequate representation_providesufficient protection for public investors? Should, under certain criteria,there be an automatic appointment of a shareholder committee or a presumptionthat a shareholder committee is needed in all public company cases? Ifso, under what criteria? Should committees also be automatically establishedfor holders of non-equity securities? Should there be presumptions in favorof the formation of such committees?As noted above, the Code intends for indenture trustees to play an activerole in the reorganization process on behalf of the debtholders. Indenturetrustees and their counsel are required to establish, before receivingreasonable compensation for their services, that their activities madea ``substantial contribution'' to the case (see section 503(b)(3)(D)).Official participants in a chapter 11 case_a trustee, counsel for a trustee,the debtor, an official committee and professionals retained by a trustee,debtor or an official committee_on the other hand, are paid reasonablecompensation for their services that are ``actual and necessary'' withoutthe need to demonstrate that their activities made a substantial contributionto the case (see section 330). An alternative would be for Congress topermit payment of compensation to indenture trustees on the same basisas payment to official participants in the case. Is the stricter standardof compensation applicable to indenture trustees appropriate or shouldthe Commission formulate a modification? Is it appropriate to require indenturetrustees to recoup some or all of their expenses from the debtholders themselves?<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>For more than 50 years the Commission has participated, on behalf of publicinvestors, in corporate reorganization proceedings under the bankruptcylaws. Over the years, the nature and scope of the Commission's participationin bankruptcy reorganization has undergone change, both as a result ofstatutory revision and as a result of changes in the Commission's own viewas to its proper role. The Commission is currently revisiting the questionof its role in reorganization cases under section 1109(a) and the possibleneed for legislative change. To this end, the Commission invites commentson the subjects covered by this release.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
