(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals panel ruled that Topeka isnot doing enough to desegregate its schools since the landmarkBrown vs. Board of Education case, but a dissenting judge cited``substantial integration.''   In the majority opinion, Judges Stephanie Seymour and MonroeMcKay overturned U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers' 1987 rulingthat Topeka schools were not responsible for lingering segregationbecause the Board of Education did not intend to keep the schoolssegregated.   The three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsin Denver released the full decision on the reopened case Tuesday,sending it back to Rogers.   The original case led to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1954that set a nationwide precedent for school desegregation and busingcases. But the parents of black schoolchildren sued 10 years ago tohave the case reopened.   The majority opinion, a reworked version of a 2-1 decision lastJune, was accompanied by a new dissenting opinion.   Today, lawyers for both sides expect to receive the latestruling.   Seymour and McKay already had overruled Rogers in June, butJudge Bobby Baldock didn't release his dissent then. The followingmonth, Seymour and McKay withdrew their decision withoutexplanation.   Lawyers speculated that they wanted a chance to respond toBaldock's dissent.   In 1979, the parents of 17 black schoolchildren sued thedistrict to reopen the Brown case, contending that the district hadfailed to eliminate all segregation.   Among those parents was Linda Brown Buckner, who was a studentat the time of the 1954 decision and whose maiden name heads thecaption of the case.   Rogers ruled in the reopened case that the school system had nointention to maintain segregated schools.   But Seymour wrote: Rogers ``erred by limiting the schooldistrict's burden merely to showing that it had non-discriminatoryreasons for acting as it did. As 30 years of desegregation law havemade clear, the Constitution requires more than ceasing to promotesegregation.''   Baldock argued the schools had done enough: ``The school boardhas demonstrated concern for improving the racial composition inthe Topeka schools while retaining the neighborhood school concept.   ``In some places the two are not compatible, but in this systemsubstantial integration has been achieved.''   Rich Jones, an attorney for the parents who sought the case'sreopening, said lawyers will key on the dissenting opinion.   ``This is the first time we get to see the dissent,'' he said.``The school district will be in a position to make a decision.''   The attorney for the school district, Joe Zima, said the boardplans to schedule a meeting early next week to consider it actions.   Zima said the school district could ask all 10 judges on theCourt of Appeals to hear the case, ask the U.S. Supreme Court tohear the case, or go before Rogers to help fashion a solution.</TEXT></DOC>
