The rule has been changedin light of the comments received. The NPRM discussed the need and the regulatory history of this rule. Thereader should refer back to this NPRM if he or she is interested in thisinformation. This rule applies only to that part of the facility between each vesseland the last manifold or valve immediately before the receiving tank, whilethe regulations promulgated by the Research and Special Programs Administration(RSPA), DOT, apply to that part of the facility beyond the last manifoldor valve immediately before the receiving tank. The RSPA proposal revisedregulations in a separate NPRM (51 FR 18007), published on the same dayas the Coast Guard NPRM. The RSPA final rule (52 FR 674) was publishedon January 8, 1987. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this proposal are: LieutenantMichael V. Franchini, Project Manager, and Stanley M. Colby, Project Counsel,Office of the Chief Counsel. General Comments Over 300 comments were received on the NPRM from 15 different commenters,the largest group (9) representing gas industry  associations or facilityoperators. Government agencies, non-industry organizations, and individualsalso commented. The Coast Guard has reviewed the comments and has adoptedthose which it deems appropriate. Some commenters were confused over the applicability of the NPRM to inactiveexisting facilities. Most of these regulations do <T3>not</T3> apply to inactive existing facilities. The three exceptionswill apply only if the inactive existing facility will become active. Theyare andSection;andSection; 127.007 (c), (d), and (e), 127.019(b), and 127.701and are listed in andSection; 127.001(c). At least some of the confusionresulted from the use of the term, ``existing structures'', for inactiveexisting facilities in proposed andSection;andSection; 127.001(c) and 127.007(c)of the NPRM. As five commenters recommended, this has been clarified inthe final rule so that they are referred to as inactive existing facilities.Seven different commenters recommended using the words, ``active'' or ``inactive''to distinguish between existing facilities, while two of these commenterssuggested definitions for these words. We agree with these comments andhave based the definitions on criteria contained in proposed andSection;127.007(e)(2) of the NPRM. In that section the operator would be requiredto notify the Captain of the Port (COTP) when LNG transfer operations arenot scheduled within the next 12 months. Therefore, ``active'' and ``inactive''in the NPRM were based on activity within a 12 month period. In the final rule, a facility that is transferring LNG or is schedulinga LNG transfer operation within 12 months of the most recent transfer operationis ``active''. The facility will remain ``active'', if a LNG transfer operationis scheduled within 12 months of the most recent transfer operation, sothat it does not change status from active to inactive after each transfer.If a facility is not active, i.e. not transferring LNG or not schedulinga LNG transfer operation within 12 months, the facility is ``inactive''and would be required under andSection; 127.007(e)(2) to notify the COTP.The term, ``in the marine transfer area'', has been deleted throughoutthe final rule (with two exceptions in andSection;andSection; 127.613 and 127.615)because its use is repetitive and confusing. These regulations apply onlyto the marine transfer area of the facility and this is clearly statedin the first section of the regulations, andSection; 127.001, Applicability.It does not need to be repeated in other sections. In the NPRM, the term,``in the marine transfer area'', was not used in every section. It wasalso deleted in the final rule so that it cannot be inferred that the sections,that did not contain the term, applied beyond this area. One comment concerned the proposed definition of marine transfer area andthe last manifold or valve immediately before the receiving tanks on afacility which exports LNG. The commenter suggested that the last valveor manifold before the receiving tanks on an export facility would be thevalve- on the landside of the tanks and would then include the receivingtanks in the marine transfer area. This would be true if you followed theflow of LNG from the process plant to the vessel and your perspective wasfrom the process plant or landside. This overlooks the fact that in thedefinition in andSection; 127.005 the boundaries of the marine transfer areabegin at the vessel or where it moors and end before the receiving tanks.Therefore, the last manifold or valve is on the waterside of the tanksand the marine transfer area does <T3>not </T3>include the receiving tanks.A few commenters suggested that these regulations would require existingfacilities to make too many changes to their current operations. It isnot our intent to place an undue burden on existing facilities or to attemptto make major changes to systems that already work. These regulations aremeant to be, and are, minimum safety standards for the marine transferarea. If an existing facility cannot comply with these requirements, theoperator has to change his operations, or submit a request for an alternativeto the COTP. If this request is denied, the operator may appeal. No oneset of regulations can be applied exactly to all existing facilities. Thealternatives and appeals processes in andSection;andSection; 127.015 and 127.017allow existing facilities the flexibility that they need to operate withoutmajor changes to comply with these regulations. Some commenters suggested that these regulations should contain more performancestandards instead of prescriptive standards, and some additional performancestandards have been included in the final rule, e.g. andSection;andSection;127.103 and 127.205. However, some proposed requirements were not suitablefor formulation as performance standards. When the actual performance standardssuggested by these commenters were evaluated, they were found to be toogeneral and too vague and were not accepted. Other commenters suggested that these regulations should be more like RSPAregulations. Every effort has been made to make these regulations are assimilar as possible to the RSPA regulations, including consulting withRSPA during the rulemaking process. RSPA regulations apply to inland facilitiesand the landside of waterfront facilities, while Coast Guard regulationsapply only to the waterside of waterfront facilities. The regulatory concernsare not the same, so the regulations cannot be identical. These regulationsmust also be as similar as possible to other Coast Guard regulations. Ifthey are not similar to Coast Guard regulations, they will be difficultto enforce by Coast Guard personnel and difficult to comply with by facilityowners and operators. The following discusses the section-by-section comments to the NPRM, aswell as changes to each section in this final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General </ITAG>Five commenters recommended adding the words, ``for which a Letter of Intentunder andSection; 127.007 has been submitted'', to the end of proposed andSection;127.001(b) so that inactive existing facilities are not required to complywith these regulations. It was never the intent of the Coast Guard thatinactive existing facilities would have to comply with the proposed regulations.The proposed definition of ``LNG waterfront facility'' in the NPRM wassuch that a facility that did not transfer LNG was not a LNG waterfrontfacility and so did not have to comply with the regulations. We have clarifiedthis point and satisfied the intent of these comments by adding the definitionof the word, ``active'', and differentiating between active and inactiveexisting facilities in the regulations. The definition of ``active'' camefrom andSection; 127.007(e)(2) in the NPRM and is discussed above with thegeneral comments. The same five commenters also recommended that the term, ``existing structures''in andSection; 127.001(c) be replaced with the word, ``existing facilities''.They reasoned that the word, ``structure'', was too generic and confusing.This confusion has been eliminated by referring to ``existing structures''as ``inactive existing facilities'' in the final rule. Two sections, thatapply to inactive existing facilities and were inadvertently left out inthe NPRM, have also been added to andSection; 127.001(c). The Department of the Interior recommended a change to the definition of``environmentally sensitive areas'' in andSection; 127.005. Their change,to add the phrase, ``other areas'' deemed to be of high value to fish andwildlife resources'', has been made. Two commenters suggested a change to the proposed definition of ``marinetransfer area'' in andSection; 127.005. They recommended that the abbreviation,``(area)'', be omitted to avoid any confusion with the other uses of theword, ``area''. This recommendation was accepted and the words, ``marinetransfer area'', are used throughout the final rule instead of the word,``area''. Three commenters recommended adding the words, ``which is involvedin the transfer of LNG'', to the end of the definition of ``marine transferarea'' so that these regulations are not applied to process equipment orother areas under RSPA jurisdiction. This change was not made. These regulationsaddress only those areas of the facility which are involved with the marinetransfer of LNG. It would be inappropriate to apply them to areas beyondCoast Guard jurisdiction. In andSection; 127.007, Letter of intent, the words, ``active existing facilities''are now used to differentiate between active and inactive facilities, asrecommended by six commenters. Less information than that proposed in theNPRM is now required in the letter of intent, in response to many commenter'srequests. The requirement for maps and charts in andSection; 127.007(d)(6)has been restricted to only that waterway used by the LNG vessels enrouteto the facility, and has been reduced to within 25 kilometers of the facility.The information requirement in proposed andSection; 127.007(d)(7) has beenomitted because it is information that can be obtained by the COTP fromother sources. Finally, changes to information in the letter of intentin andSection; 127.007(e)(1) have been limited to changes only to the informationin sections (d) (1) through (5). All of these changes will reduce the informationreporting burden on facility operators and are in accordance with federalobjectives under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Four commenters requested that a time limit be placed in andSection; 127.009,requiring the COTP to draft the letter of recommendation within 30 days.They wanted time to revise construction or operation plans if the COTPdid not issue a favorable letter of recommendation. We agree that the COTPshould prepare the letter of recommendation promptly so that delay andcosts are minimized. However, circumstances vary and the Coast Guard doesnot intend to restrict the COTP or establish a right to a response in aspecified time. There has been no demonstrated need for such provisions.Two commenters thought that the letter of recommendation was not necessaryfor existing facilities since their construction and operations had alreadybeen subject to review. This change has been made. The information proposedin andSection; 127.007(d)(7) in the NPRM for the letter of intent still needsto be considered by the COTP when issuing a letter of recommendation. Becauseof this, this information, i.e. depths of water, tidal range, etc., hasbeen included as andSection; 127.009(d) in the final rule. Two comments were made concerning proposed andSection; 127.015, Appeals.They were: Including time limits on the actions of the COTP and requiringthat any order remain in effect pending the outcome of the process. However,this section was not changed because the recommended changes would makethis appeal procedure incompatible with procedures found in other CoastGuard regulations in Title 33. One of the above commenters also suggestedtime limits on the actions of the COTP be included in proposed andSection;127.017, Alternatives. Again, this change was not made. It is Coast Guardpolicy to complete the required correspondence promptly in order not tocause the operator undue delay and costs. There has been no demonstratedneed for specified time limits.The words, ``active'' and ``inactive'', are used again in andSection;andSection;127.019 (a) and (b) to differentiate between existing facilities, as recommendedby five commenters. Three commenters were concerned that not enough timewas allowed operators of active existing facilities to submit the <T3>Operations Manual </T3>and the <T3>Emergency Manual </T3>in andSection; 127.019. They suggested that from90-180 days be given to submit the manuals. In response to these comments,the effective date of these regulations has been set at June 2, 1988. Thisshould allow enough time to implement any new requirements or changes thatresult from these regulations, without suspending transfer operations.Four commenters recommended that the <T3>Operations Manual </T3>and <T3>Emergency Manual </T3>be maintained on-site and not submitted to theCOTP. We disagree with this recommendation. The COTP needs to refer tothese manuals during discussions with facility personnel, during examinations,and subsequent questions by Coast Guard personnel, and while respondingto emergencies. Having copies at the COTP office will save the operatorand the Coast Guard time when the COTP references the manuals instead ofvisiting the facility and examining systems and equipment there. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Design and Construction </ITAG>Section 127.101(b) has been added in response to the comment that thereare requirements in proposed andSection; 127.103(a) that a facility be designedto resist earthquake forces, but no earthquake criteria were provided.One commenter pointed out the conflict in the NPRM between proposed andSection;127.615, which does not allow fires in the marine transfer area, and proposedandSection; 127.103(c), which allowed direct combustion heating equipmentin the marine transfer area of new facilities. Because it was never ourintent to allow fires in the marine transfer area, and to make the requirementsconsistent with NFPA 59A, ``Standards for the Production, Storage and Handlingof LNG_1985 edition'', andSection; 127.103(c) has been deleted. Section 127.103(d), concerning LNG and LPG storage tanks, has been rewrittenin response to four comments, which recommended that the size limit bereplaced with a performance standard. Section 127.103(d)(3) has been addedin response to four comments, which stated there are other purposes forstorage tanks in the marine transfer area. Seven commenters recommended that ``power systems'' be changed to ``powersources'' in proposed andSection; 127.107, Electrical power systems. Thesecommenters argued that 100% redundant electrical systems are not necessaryand not required in any other code or regulation. We agree and have madethis change in the final rule. Five commenters expressed some confusionwith the requirement in proposed andSection; 127.107(b)(1) for emergencypower for the control room. They questioned whether we intended that theemergency power source provide enough power for the operation of the controlroom itself or the systems operated from the control room. The emergencypower source should not duplicate the operation of the electrical powersource. It should provide power to only those systems necessary in an emergency.In order to eliminate this confusion and to be as specific as possible,andSection; 127.107(b)(1) now requires emergency power only for the emergencyshutdown system. Six commenters made similar recommendations concerning the separate emergencylighting system in proposed andSection; 127.109(a). This has been changedto ``separate emergency lighting'' so that there are not two redundantsystems. Section 127.109(d)(1), one of the systems for which emergencylighting must be provided, has been changed to ``emergency shutdown system''to be consistent with andSection; 127.107(b)(1). Six commenters recommended that, to be consistent, the proposed requirementsin andSection;andSection; 127.107 (d) and (e) for electrical equipment shouldbe used in andSection; 127.109(b)(1) for lighting equipment. Another commenterrecommended in andSection; 127.111(b)(1) that NFPA 70, the National ElectricCode be used instead of Coast Guard regulations for intrinsic safety. Weagree with both commenters that these paragraphs need to be consistentand that existing nationally-recognized codes should be used where possible.In order to eliminate the confusion of all three paragraphs referring tosimilar but different requirements in Coast Guard regulations and NFPAstandards, and to make the electrical equipment requirements consistentthroughout the regulations, andSection;andSection; 127.107 (d) and (e), 127.109(b)(1),and 127.111(b) (1) and (2) have been omitted in the final rule in favorof andSection; 127.101. In andSection; 127.101 in the NPRM and in the finalrule, the marine transfer area must meet NFPA 59A Chapter 7, Sections 7-6and 7-7. These sections either refer to the NFPA 70 requirements or arebased on them. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_Equipment </ITAG>One commenter recommended a change to proposed andSection; 127.201(a), Sensingand alarm systems, so that placement of the audio alarm in accordance withthis requirement did not restrict its sound. In response to this recommendationthe words, ``where the sensors are located'' are replaced with the word,``nearby''. The words, ``enclosed or covered'' have been added to andSection;127.201(c)(1) because two commenters stated that, as proposed in the NPRM,it would require an excessive number of sensors. Concerning andSection; 127.205, Emergency shutdown, four commenters statedthat outdoor gas sensors are notoriously unreliable when measuring LNGconcentrations. They also said that the transfer operation is so well-manned,that it would be better to rely on the judgment of a qualified operatorto activate the system. We agree that outdoor gas sensors may be unreliable,but do not agree that the activation of the emergency shutdown system shouldrely solely on the judgment of an operator. Instead of relying on outdoorgas sensors, the requirement in the final rule relies on measurements fromthe fixed sensors in andSection; 127.201, which are located in enclosed areas,to activate the system automatically. The requirement to provide a meansto activate the system manually, has not been changed. Four commenters suggested that proposed andSection; 127.207, Warning alarms,be omitted. We do not agree. This requirement applies only to new facilitiesand is essentially the same as the requirement that now applies to existingwaterfront facilities in 33 CFR 126.16. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Operations </ITAG>One change was made to andSection; 127.301, Person in charge of shoresidetransfer operations: Qualifications and certification. A commenter recommendeda person in charge be allowed to obtain the required previous transferexperience at an inland or waterfront facility, since there are few active``facilities'' as defined. The words, ``at any facility'', have been ommitedto remove the restriction that the experience required in andSection; 127.301(a)(1)be obtained at a facility covered by these rules. Two commenters statedthat it is difficult to ensure that a person in charge ``knows'', as requiredby proposed andSection;andSection; 127.301(a) (2)-(4), the hazards of LNG,etc. They recommended that the person in charge either take a written testor show documented training to demonstrate the required knowledge. We haverejected this recommendation. The requirement is more flexible as writtenin the NPRM. It will be up to the facility operator to determine, by anyappropriate means, that the person in charge complies with this requirement.One commenter was concerned that transfer operations at active existingfacilities would be suspended while the <T3>Operations Manual </T3>and the <T3>Emergency Manual </T3>were being examined, because of the proposedrequirement in andSection; 127.309(a). The effective date of the regulationshas been set at June 2, 1988. This should allow more than enough time tosubmit the above manuals for examination and have a copy returned underthe procedures in andSection; 127.019.The requirements in andSection; 127.311 (b) and (c) for motor vehicles havebeen changed so that they apply only during transfer operations. Threecommenters recommended this change so that maintenance vehicles may beallowed in other parts of the marine transfer area when transfer operationsare not being conducted. Four other commenters recommended that proposedandSection; 127.311(b) read ``No person may leave unattended a motor vehiclein a space in the marine transfer area * * *''. We do not agree. Includingthis criteria would remove all restrictions on where a motor vehicle stopsor parks in the marine transfer area as long as it was ``attended''. Thiswould not restrict ignition sources. Four commenters recommended that the words, ``flammable materials'', beadded after ``the following'' in proposed andSection; 127.313, Bulk storage.This was done so that quantities of nitrogen, dry chemical, CO<T2>2</T2>, and water could be stored in the marine transfer area. In proposed andSection; 127.315, Preliminary transfer inspection, paragraph(a) was clarified, as suggested by one commenter, so that only the transferpiping to be used during the transfer is inspected. It is not necessaryto inspect transfer piping that is not being used. Two commenters recommendedthat the density not be noted in andSection; 127.315(b) because it is usuallycalculated based on temperature and pressure. We accept this recommendationand have revised the section accordingly. Two commenters said that thefacility should not be responsible for the ship's moorings, as suggestedin proposed andSection; 127.315(d). This is not the intent of the proposedrequirement, which concerns the transfer connections and not the moorings.It is the responsibility of the facility to ensure that these connectionsdo not unduly restrict the movement of the ship due to tides. This sectionhas not been revised. As recommended by four commenters, the referencesto sections which apply only to new facilities, in proposed andSection;andSection;127.315 (f) and (i) which apply to new and active existing facilities,have been omitted. Two comments were made concerning proposed andSection; 127.317(c), Declarationof inspection. One recommended that the signature of the relief personin charge was not needed and the other recommended revised wording, bothwithout supporting reasons. Without such support, other than implied preference,there was no reason to make any changes to this section. Several comments were made concerning proposed andSection; 127.319, LNG transfer.We agreed with the recommendation that vessels be allowed to moor outboardof an LNG vessel with the permission of the COTP, and revised andSection;127.319(a)(3). This is necessary to provide moorings for vessels whichreceive oily wastes and for tugs. Concerning proposed andSection; 127.319(b)(3)(iii),two commenters recommended that we define ``uncontrolled fires''. Thisis not necessary. When the meaning of a word is not distinguished by adefinition of it in the regulations, it has the every-day meaning foundin a dictionary. This is true in this case; ``uncontrolled'' means lackof control. Seven commenters questioned the distance proposed in andSection;127.319(b)(3). The resulting revisions simplify the requirement so thattransfer operations must be discontinued before electrical storms or uncontrolledfires are adjacent to the marine transfer area. The reference in proposedandSection; 127.319(b)(4) to andSection; 127.109, which only applies to newfacilities, has been omitted, as recommended by six commenters. Concerning proposed andSection; 127.321, Release of LNG, two commenters recommendedchanges that would allow facilities to release small amounts of LNG duringnormal operations, but did not recommend what amount could be releasedsafely. We do not believe that there is an amount of LNG that can be releasedinto the water safely. LNG spilled on the water could not be containedand would spread and evaporate very quickly. This release could easilyfind an ignition source. This recommendation was rejected. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart E_Maintenance </ITAG>Five commenters recommended that, in order to be consistent with RSPA requirements,we change andSection;andSection; 127.403, Inspections, and 127.407(a), Testing,to read, ``each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months''.These changes were made because we agree that one facility piping systemshould not have two different inspection and testing intervals. Section127.405(a)(1), which applies to active existing facilities, referencessubparts that apply only to new facilities. It has been revised to read,``the applicable requirements'', as recommended by five commenters. Two other changes were made to this subpart, both in proposed andSection;127.407, Testing. In andSection; 127.407(a)(4), seven commenters stated thatpiping that is constantly kept at cryogenic temperature does not undergophysical or thermal stress from expansion/contraction and is not susceptibleto corrosion. For these reasons, this piping does not need to be tested,and this exception has been included in this section. Also, the requirementto test the transfer system to 1.5 times the Maximum Allowable WorkingPressure (MAWP) in proposed andSection; 127.407(b) has been changed to 1.1times the MAWP. Nine commenters pointed out that to test to 1.5 times theMAWP was not consistent with nationally recognized codes and almost impossibleto accomplish with LNG piping. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart F_Personnel Training </ITAG>Four commenters expressed concern about the effective date of the trainingrequirements in proposed andSection; 127.501 for inactive existing facilities.Inactive existing facilities are not required to meet the training requirementsin this section while they are inactive. For this reason, the applicabilityof this subpart has been clarified and included in the final rule in anew section, andSection; 127.501, Applicability. Because the effective dateof these regulations has been set at January 2, 1988, this new sectionalso allows sufficient time to complete the required training. Five commenters were confused with the applicability of our training requirementsto employees who do not work in the marine transfer area. Because the regulationsonly apply in the marine transfer area, these training requirements onlyapply to employees who work in this area. The training descriptions inproposed andSection;andSection; 127.501 (a)(1) and (b)(2)-(4) were respecified,but the training remains the same. These descriptions were too generalin the NPRM and some commenters were not sure what was required. Two commenters recommended that refresher training in proposed andSection;127.501(c) be required every 2 years, as required by RSPA. However, refreshertraining every 5 years is consistent with Coast Guard regulations for merchantseaman. Our experience with that program does not support the need formore frequent refresher training.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart G_Firefighting </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 127.605, Emergency outfits, was rewritten as recommendedby three commenters, so that the storage of the outfits is not limitedto the marine transfer area. The final rule requires that there be an emergencyoutfit for each person whose duties include fighting fires, instead ofrequiring that, ``Each area must have an emergency outfit * * *'' Thiswill ensure that the outfits are also available for use in other portionsof the facility and not isolated in the marine transfer area. Two commentersquestioned the need for emergency outfits. Protective clothing, i.e. emergencyoutfits, is needed for two purposes. First, any person involved in firefightingmust be protected with at least an emergency outfit. Second, emergencyoutfits are usually needed by members of a rescue team (minimum of two)to rescue an injured person. The requirements in andSection; 127.605 areminimum requirements. If no person is assigned to firefighting duties,the facility is only required to maintain two outfits for rescue purposes.This section does not require the facility to develop an extensive firefightingand rescue capability. The requirement in proposed andSection; 127.607(a), Fire main systems, toprovide two water streams to each part of the marine transfer area canbe excessive on a marine transfer area that is very large and spread out.It is not our intent to require facility operators to protect large areasof the marine transfer area that do not contain LNG. Therefore, this sectionhas been rewritten, as two commenters recommended, so that two water streamsmust only be provided for each part of the LNG transfer piping and connections.Two other commenters recommended that these requirements go one step furtherand that only the portion of the marine transfer area within 100 metersof the loading flange be protected by water streams. This recommended changehas not been made because protecting only the loading flange area wouldnot be enough to protect most marine transfer areas. There may be exceptionsto this. An example is where there are miles of transfer pipeline thatcan easily be isolated in many places along the line, where the transferpipeline is not located near other structures or equipment in the marinetransfer area, and where there are sufficient water streams to protectthe loading flange area and the receiving tanks. However, this type ofmarine transfer area is rare. Because of this and because these requirementsare not intended to result in major refitting of existing facilities, thismay be a requirement for which a facility would request an alternativeunder andSection; 127.017. This request could then be evaluated by the COTP.In the same section, Fire main systems, andSection; 127.607(c)(2) was intendedto stand alone and not be required at the same time as paragraph (c)(1).However, six commenters interpreted these requirements so that the firemain system would provide the required pressure in paragraph (c)(2) whileall the other hydrants were open as required in paragraph (c)(1). The words,``when only those two outlets are open'', have been added to the end ofandSection; 127.607(c)(2) in order to clarify it. One commenter wanted tobe able to use hoses that were greater than 1\1/2\ inches in diameter asrequired in andSection; 127.607(f). This was accomplished by inserting thewords, ``or more'', after inches in this requirement. The coverage of the dry chemical system in andSection; 127.609(a) also concerneda few commenters. Two commenters recommended that the system not providetwo dry chemical discharges to each part of the marine transfer area, butthat it provide discharges only to that part along the LNG transfer pipingand connections. Two other commenters recommended that it provide coverageto only the area around the loading flange. We agree that providing drychemical discharges for the entire marine transfer area, which does notcontain LNG, or for the transfer piping and connections, which may be verylong, is unreasonable. Therefore, andSection; 127.609(a) has been rewritten,as recommended by the comments, so that the dry chemical system providesdischarges to only that area surrounding the loading arms. Two commenterssuggested that this section be revised one step further, i.e. that onlya dry chemical system be required, with no other requirements for numberof discharges, coverage, etc. This comment was rejected because it wouldmake the requirement too broad and too general. It would leave it completelyup to the different COTPs and the facility operators to decide what drychemical system should exist, without any guidance from the regulation.Four comments were received concerning proposed andSection; 127.613, Smoking,stating that smoking should be allowed in posted areas approved by theCOTP. The requirement in the NPRM does not prohibit smoking in the marinetransfer area. It only prohibits smoking when there is LNG in the marinetransfer area. Therefore, this comment was not accepted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart H_Security </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 127.703, Access to the marine transfer area, has beenrewritten to allow into the marine transfer area personnel authorized bythe facility operator and visitors with temporary identifying badges. Sevencommenters recommended these changes so that elected officials, corporateexecutives, foreign dignitaries, etc. could be allowed into the marinetransfer area. Evaluation The Transportation Systems Center (TSC) prepared a report entitled, <T3>Preliminary Impact Analysis of the U.S. Coast Guard's Proposed LNGRegulations,</T3> which is included in the docket file and is availablethrough the Project Manager listed under ``For Further Information Contact''.For the analysis, a composite baseline standard was used by which the typesof incremental costs and benefits, as well as their distributional effects,were identified. The baseline consisted of: (1) Current Coast Guard WaterfrontFacilities regulations (33 CFR 126); (2) USCG facility operations planswhich are issued by the COTP for the port in which an LNG facility is located;and (3) National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards. The primaryLNG standard is NFPA 59A, ``Standards for the Production, Storage and Handlingof LNG_1985 edition''. NFPA standards are considered to be minimum industrystandards voluntarily adopted by the LNG industry. The analysis determinedthe impacts of the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) by identifyingwhere the proposed regulations exceed current practices and, therefore,where costs and benefits would accrue. Of the 72 sections contained in the ANPRM, 54 were analyzed in the TSCreport. Thirty-five or 65% of the 54 analyzed, introduced no change fromthe current baseline standards. Of the nineteen sections of the ANPRM thatexceeded current requirements and standards, fifteen resulted in administrativecosts, mostly for facility operators. Most of these costs would be minimaland not recurring. An example of an administrative cost would be the preparationand submission of an <T3>Operations Manual </T3>and an <T3>Emergency Manual </T3>to the COTP. The impact of this requirement wouldbe minimal because facility operators already submit much of this informationto the COTP or maintain it themselves.The proposed fire protection and security regulations of the ANPRM andNPRM were not analyzed by TSC because the Coast Guard's proposed regulationsare similar to the RSPA's final rules found in 49 CFR Part 193. A telephonesurvey of all facilities indicated that the proposed regulations in theNPRM did not exceed known current industry practices. However, some commentsto the NPRM indicated that this was not true for some of the proposed regulations.Changes to the final rule, as a result of these comments, ensure that theseregulations do not exceed current industry practices. To ensure the currency and validity of the TSC report, requests for estimatesof the compliance costs of this NPRM, were sent to two operating facilities.The results were the latest cost figures and confirmed that the TSC reportcould still be applied to the NPRM. The survey information and the TSCreport were both used in the final cost/benefit analysis. Of the 52 sections contained in the NPRM, 39 or 75% introduced no changefrom the current baseline requirements and standards. Of the thirteen sectionsof the NPRM that exceed current requirements, 8 would result in administrativecosts. This is a 32% decrease from ANPRM to NPRM in the number of sectionsin the rulemaking that exceed current requirements. These figures alsoapply to the final rule. These safety standards will result in low compliance costs. According tothe analysis in the Final Evaluation, the total initial cost of these regulationsto the LNG industry is $96,000.00 and the annual recurring cost is $44,000.00.These costs represent such a relatively small amount of money to the industrythat it is believed that these regulations will have no perceptible impacton the industry. The TSC analysis concluded that due to the low probability of an LNG accidentoccurring, the expected value of the quantifiable benefits of the NPRMwere low. The benefits would be great if an accident occurred. A ``maximumcredible accident'', as discussed in the Final Evaluation, involving apool fire of 30,000 m \3\ in an area with a population density of 10 peopleper km \2\ at the dock site, could result in 21 fatalities with a costto society in excess of $21 million in property damage, injury, and lossof life. If the same pool fire occurred in an area with a population 1000persons per km \2\, the result could be 3,810 fatalities with social costsof over $3.8 billion in property damage, injury, and loss of life. Accidents involving small amounts of LNG have occurred in the past. TheNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated one such accidentthat occurred at a facility on October 6, 1979. According to NTSB reportNo. NTSB-PAR-80-2, ``About 3:35 a.m., e.d.t., an explosion caused by liquefiednatural gas vapors destroyed a transformer building at the reception facilityof the Columbia LNG Corporation, Cove Point, Maryland. Odorless liquefiednatural gas leaked through an inadequately tightened LNG pump seal, vaporized,passed through approximately 210 ft. of underground electrical conduit,and entered the substation building. One person was killed and one personwas seriously injured. Damage to the facility was estimated at about $3million.''Despite the very large savings that would result from preventing a majorLNG accident or mitigating the results of an accident if it occurred atan LNG facility, it is difficult to precisely quantify the benefits thatwill accrue. This is because of the extremely low probability of a majorLNG accident occurring. The limited number of reported LNG facility accidentsrequires that probability estimates of accidents be based on the theoreticalanalysis of factors which might lead to their occurrence. There is largeinherent uncertainty associated with such estimates, and hence of the cost/benefitvalues derived from them. Because of such uncertainties, prudence dictatesan extra measure of caution where there is potential for a catastrophicaccident. Such caution should be weighed along with other considerationswhen judging the need for safety standards that can reduce the possibilityof a catastrophic LNG accident. This is true even when these measures maynot be justified based on a theoretical risk analysis. The benefits that cannot be quantified were discussed in the preamble ofthe NPRM. They include replacing outdated regulations, filling a gap infederal regulations, making industry standards and practices mandatory,and consolidating and better organizing the regulations. These safety standards are considered to be non-major under Executive Order12291 of February 17, 1981 (3 CFR, 1982 Comp., p. 127) and non-significantunder the DOT regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979). The total cost to the industry of these LNG safety standardsdoes not exceed the $100 million threshold to qualify as a major rulemaking,and so a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. This rule contains information collection requirements in sections 127.007,127.015, 127.017, 127.019, 127.301, 127.317, and 127.409. They have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and assignedcontrol number 2115-0552. As a result of the comments received, the informationcollection requirements have been reduced in the final rule. The Coast Guard certifies that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This is because few,if any, small entities are involved in these costly and highly technicaloperations. All the existing facilities are owned and operated by multimilliondollar corporations. This regulatory project is not anticipated to have an adverse impact onthe environment. It is intended to prevent or mitigate the results of acatastrophic accident at a facility. The Final Evaluation and the Final Environmental Assessment and Findingof No Significant Impact have been placed in the rulemaking docket fileand are available for inspection and copying from the Marine Safety Council(G-CMC), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001,(202) 267-1477. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>33 CFR Part 4 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.33 CFR Part 126 Explosives, Harbors, Hazardous substances, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements 33 CFR Part 127 Harbors, Hazardous substances, Incorporation by reference, Natural gas,Security measures, Vessels In accordance with the preceding, Subchapter L, Chapter I of Title 33,Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 4_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
