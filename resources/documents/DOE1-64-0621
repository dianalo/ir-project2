<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0621 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed an original methodologyfor performing risk analyses on subject systems characterized by a generalset of asset categories, a general spectrum of threats, a definable system-specificset of protecting the assets from the threats, and a general set of outcomingresulting from threats exploiting weaknesses in the safeguards system.Applications of this methodology can be tailored to address a wide varietyof subject systems' risk analysis requirements. The Los Alamos Vulnerabilityand Risk Assessment Methodology (LAVA) models complex systems havinglarge amounts of ``soft'' information about both the subject system itselfand occurrences related to the system. Its structure lends itself wellto automation on a portable computer, making it possible to analyze numeroussimilar but geographically separated installations consistently and inas much depth as the subject system warrants. LAVA is based on hierarchicalsystems theory, event trees, fuzzy sets, natural-language processing,decision theory, and utility theory. LAVA's framework is a hierarchicalset of fuzzy event trees relating the results of several embedded (orsub-) analyses: a vulnerability assessment providing information aboutthe presence and efficacy of system safeguards, a threat analysis providinginformation about static (background) and dynamic (changing) threat componentscoupled with an analysis of asset ``attractiveness'' to the dynamic threat,and a consequence analysis providing information about the outcome spectrum'sseverity measures and impact values. Each sub-analysis can be simplifiedor made complex, depending on the sensitivity and relative worth of thesubject system. 34 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
