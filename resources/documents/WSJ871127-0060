Wang, Adds PostOf Operating Chief</HL><DD> 11/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WANB WNEWS </IN><DATELINE> LOWELL, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wang Laboratories Inc. gave its president, Frederick A. Wang, the additional title of chief operating officer.    The position, which had been vacant, reflects the role the 37-year-old Mr. Wang has filled since last December, when he succeeded his father, company founder An Wang, as president. An Wang, now 67 years old, remains chairman and chief executive officer.    Frederick Wang met widespread skepticism when he became president in the midst of quarterly losses and corporate turmoil. Shortly after taking the reins, he replaced top marketers, announced a round of layoffs and cut the pay of white-collar workers. The maker of computer and word-processing systems has bounced back since then, reporting profit for the three most recent quarters and predicting a revenue increase of 15% to 20% for the current fiscal year.    Frederick Wang's father, in a prepared statement, said, &quot;The board took this action in recognition of Mr. Wang's leadership role in setting Wang Laboratories back on course toward consistent earnings growth.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
