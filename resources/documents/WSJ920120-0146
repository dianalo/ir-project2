The contract, from Mexico's stateoil monopoly, was for Sonat to drill six wells off theYucatan.   But there's a hitch. Unlike drilling ventures that foreigncompanies have in some nations, payment will be strictly incash. Sonat won't get any of the oil, which Mexico considerspart of its &quot;patrimony&quot; and isn't willing to share with anyforeigner.</LP><TEXT>   Mexico's oil has an emotional history. More than 50 yearsago, Mexico booted out U.S. and European oil companies forignoring a Mexican Supreme Court labor order. Mexicans stillcelebrate the 1938 oil expropriation with a national holidayand toast their oil-rig workers with a potent drink oftequila and oily steak sauce dubbed &quot;petroleo,&quot; Spanish forpetroleum. Feelings are especially strong against Yankeeinterlopers, who, after all, took oil-rich Texas from Mexicoin 1848.   In just three years, the administration of PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari has undone decades of Mexicanprotectionism and trade barriers. He has privatized the phonecompany, the banks, mines and most recently communalfarmlands. Even in the energy sector, imports of U.S. naturalgas have quadrupled since 1990, one gas-pipeline project hasbeen approved, and U.S. oil drillers have won their firstMexican contracts in decades.   Only Big Oil remains out of the Salinas script. &quot;Thecontracts are a step in the right direction,&quot; says Ed Porterof the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group, &quot;butit isn't close to the kinds of openings the major oilcompanies want.&quot; The oil industry is making its complaintsheard, urging negotiators of a free-trade agreement among theU.S., Canada and Mexico to push harder on trade possibilitieswith Petroleos Mexicanos S.A., or Pemex, as the state oilmonopoly is known.   Mexico's reform-minded president and President Bush bothsay they would like the free-trade pact inked in 1992. Adraft of the pact is expected at the end of this month, andcertain chapters are now circulating. But a 1992 signature ofthe treaty is uncertain, given the sluggish U.S. economy andthe election year. Thus, the recent U.S. message at the tradetable: Lubricate passage with petroleum opportunities forU.S. companies.   &quot;The Americans are turning on the heat,&quot; says a Mexicansource close to the negotiations. &quot;They basically wanteverything on oil. They want everything except the right toown the land.&quot;   But the Mexican constitution, which Mexico's top tradenegotiators say is &quot;inalterable,&quot; restricts petroleumownership to Mexican nationals. While many nations'constitutions grant control over mineral rights exclusivelyto nationals, Mexico goes a step further. Its separatepetroleum regulations specifically prohibit payment withcrude -- the toughest restriction in Latin America, say oilexecutives.   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, a former boarddirector at Chevron Corp., says President Bush &quot;respects theconstitutional prohibition.&quot; But energy already comprises 25%of the three-way trade, she notes. &quot;We would like to get asmuch liberalization as possible.&quot;   With little or no investment during the debt-burdened1980s, Mexico's proven reserves actually shrank 10%. They nowstand at 44.5 billion barrels of oil, a respectable amounteven by Middle East standards. Pemex actually states them as65.5 billion barrels of &quot;hydrocarbons,&quot; lumping oil, gas andcondensates into one confusing figure. But last month, theleftleaning Mexican magazine Procesoran ran a cover headline:&quot;The Lies of Pemex.&quot; Inside, Pemex's retired chief of primaryproduction asserted Mexico actually had half the 65.5 billionbarrels. Pemex disagrees with his claim.   Whatever the reserves, the U.S. Export-Import Bank warnedin a recent memo that &quot;Pemex must develop new productioncapabilities or Mexico will become an oilimporting country inthe foreseeable future.&quot;   Many oil companies are willing to assist investment-shortMexico in averting that. But they want production-sharingcontracts. Careful not to inflame nationalism, oil officialstalk euphemistically about &quot;association&quot; or &quot;management&quot;contracts. Payment could be in the form of discounts on crudepurchases, suggests one official.   Pemex dismisses the likelihood of production-sharing. Inhis expansive, top-floor suite, Manuel J. Ortiz de Maria,Pemex subdirector of primary production, says there will beno &quot;alternatives or situations that would establishmechanisms that commit volumes of crude.&quot;   But Mr. Ortiz is caught between Mexico's nationalisticpast and its modernizing future. His exploration andproduction division, the most important in the Pemex empire,is being shaken by layoffs and the award of contracts toforeign drillers.   Since President Salinas came to power, Pemex staff hasshrunk by a third to about 150,000 employees. Under contractto the Mexican oil monopoly, Houston-based TritonInternational Inc. bored into the ocean floor last springwith a successful exploratory well in a record 127 days, halfPemex's usual time.   Sonat's victory here, with its Mexican partner EPN ArvalS.A., is only the second such contract for a foreigner in atleast two decades. But dozens more service contracts fordrilling by U.S. firms are assured because of U.S.Export-Import Bank stipulations tied to $1.3 billion in loanguarantees granted last year.   &quot;This contract in no way compromises the patrimony of thestate,&quot; says Mr. Powell, the Venezuelan-born vice presidentof the Sonat unit drilling the wells.   But oil multinationals emphasize that they aren't in thecontracting business. Texaco Inc. operates joint ventures inColombia, Ecuador and Argentina on a continent where oil is asymbol of national independence. &quot;I think the Mexicans willrealize the difficulty they will have in financing their ownneeds,&quot; says Bill Carter, Texaco's contract manager in itsLatin America and West Africa group.   Some don't agree, though. Despite the heady 4% growth ofMexico's economy for the past two years and the whipping ofthree-digit inflation, the country's huge foreign debtremains at $100 billion. And Pemex revenues provided about40% of the 1990 federal budget, according to the World Bank.&quot;You should get some efficiencies by subcontracting {toforeigners},&quot; says Sweder van Wijnbergen, a World Bankeconomist. &quot;But I think there is some merit to the Mexicanargument {for protecting Pemex}, purely on economics and notpolitics.&quot;   Meantime, the Pemex welcome mat in non-oil energy venturesis still out. To meet environmental and energy needs in thebooming industrial corridor of assembly plants along the2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, Mexico is sucking up U.S.natural gas, a cleaner-burning fuel, at quadruple the rate itdid in 1990. Imports last year averaged 170 million cubicfeet daily.   The trade has grown so rapidly that in December, ValeroEnergy Co. of San Antonio, Texas, won U.S. regulatoryapproval to construct a short gas pipeline under the RioGrande. Two other Texas companies are cajoling Mexicanofficials to let them build and own much larger gaspipelines.   &quot;The market is so poor in the U.S. that we are fallingover ourselves to connect pipelines down there,&quot; says TomRommel, a Houston natural gas-broker. A third of U.S. gasreserves are in the Texas and New Mexico border states.   With Mexico City pollution hitting unsafe levels for abouthalf of 1991, imports into Mexico of unleaded gasoline havedoubled recently. And Italy's Ente Nazionale Idrocarburiplans to build a huge petrochemical plant in Mexico forproduction of MTBE, an essential component of unleadedgasoline.   MTBE was once on Mexico's 70-item list of basicpetrochemicals reserved for state production. The list hasbeen steadily whacked back to 19 items.</TEXT></DOC>
