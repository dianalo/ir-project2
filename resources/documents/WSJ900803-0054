The &quot;strategic petroleum reserve,&quot; placed in salt domes inTexas and Louisiana, now contains almost 590 million barrelsof crude that the government began stockpiling in response tothe Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. That's enough to offsetall imports for 75 days at current import levels. Plans callfor the reserve to reach 750 million barrels by themid-1990s.</LP><TEXT>   House and Senate conferees have been debating a proposalto increase the flow of oil into the reserve to bring it toone billion barrels, and the Mideast war gives the provisiona boost. Until now, the Bush administration had opposed thehigher level partly on the grounds that the likelihood of asupply disruption was minimal. At a news conference lateyesterday afternoon, Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Mooresaid the government &quot;has seen nothing to cause us to rethinkthat decision.&quot; But many people on Capitol Hill expect thehigher level to be approved.   Mr. Moore told reporters that he expects neither theinvasion nor the U.S. embargo of Iraqi oil to result in a&quot;long-term, significant increase&quot; in oil prices or adisruption in supplies to the U.S. Thus, he said, the Bushadministration has no plans to tap the reserve. He cited thecurrent oversupply of oil on world markets and high levels ofdomestic commercial stocks of crude oil and refined products.   The invasion of Kuwait sparked a debate on whether to usethe reserve to ease the supply disruption that would ensue ifthe U.S. and several of its allies tried to impose a worldquarantine on Iraqi oil. Philip K. Verleger, a visitingfellow at the Institute for International Economics, calledfor using the reserve oil to help ease the impact of sharplyhigher prices that would occur if such an embargo worked.With an effective embargo, he predicted, prices could reach$45 a barrel.   But Mr. Moore said no thought has been given to using theoil in that way. The reserve &quot;isn't designed as a pricingmechanism,&quot; he said.   Currently all the oil in the reserve is owned by the U.S.But under pending legislation required to authorize thecontinued build-up of the strategic reserve, the U.S. wouldbe allowed to begin leasing some of the crude as a way toreduce the cost of filling the reserve. Under this plan, anoil supplier would lease the oil to the U.S. for a fee thatproponents say could be as low as 50 cents to $1 a barrel.Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have expressed interest in such anarrangement, according to congressional aides.   Under the leasing plan, the U.S. in case of an emergencywould take possession of the oil and be free to use it. Whenand if any was sold, the supplying nation would get theproceeds.   The president can decide to draw down oil from the reserveafter determining there is a serious disruption to the flowof imported oil or the potential for such an interruption.The Bush administration also would determine the rate atwhich the oil could be used, based on an estimate of how longthe disruption is likely to last.   The 75-day supply of imported oil that the reserve couldoffset compares with more than 100 days in the early 1980s.The number of days has declined even as the reserve has grownbecause U.S. consumption of foreign oil has shot up in recentyears.   ---                   Key Dates in the Crisis                                                                                                          July 17 -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein denouncesPersian Gulf countries that exceed their oil-productionquotas, accusing them of stabbing Iraq in the back.
