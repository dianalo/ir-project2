Cultural landmarks in the 10-block area were reduced tosmoldering ruins in the blaze that broke out before dawn Thursdayin a 19th century department store and caused bottles of butane gasto explode.   Both the Armazens do Grandela and the Grandes Armazens doChiado, the city's only department stores, were destroyed as werethe Costa e Martins speciality grocery, the Eduardo Martins chinashop and the 350-year-old Casa Batalha button store.   The stores were among the oldest in Europe, and their woodenfloors, staircases and cashier booths dated from the late 19thcentury when the stores were built to cater to the Portuguesecapital's emerging middle class.   Neither was fitted with a sprinkler system and firefighterscomplained about low water pressure.   Civil defense officials said a 60-year-old man died when flamesengulfed his apartment and that 43 other people, most of themfirefighters, were hospitalized for burns and smoke inhalation.Hundreds were evacuated.   The fire destroyed the offices of many lawyers and accountantswho scurried down the slippery streets carrying files anddocuments. They were joined by fleeing residents carrying cats,dogs and caged parakeets.   Firefighters did not arrive at the scene until an hour after thefire was reported about 3 a.m. by a watchman at the 19th-centuryelevator built by Gustave Eiffel to connect the Chiado to streetsin the area below. Fire equipment for the district had been calledout to another, minor fire and became stuck in the narrow streets.   The Chiado was a favorite haunt of Portuguese writers andmusicians with its cafes and shops selling fine leather gloves,buttons, books and records.   Its destruction was described by newspapers as the worstdisaster to strike the capital since an earthquake and fire in1755. Much of the Chiado was created when the Marques de Pombalrebuilt Lisbon after the quake.   The cause of the blaze was under investigation. Police onWednesday questioned Manuel Martins Dias, principal shareholder inthe group that owns The Armazens do Grandela, the three-storydepartment store where the blaze broke out, about a mysterious firein another store owned by the group.   Seen from the air late Thursday afternoon through a cloud ofdense smoke, the walls of the burned-out buildings stood like theruins of war in the midst of a sunny, red-roofed city.   ``Lisbon is poorer because of this catastrophe,'' PresidentMario Soares told reporters day as the fire roared through150-year-old buildings behind him.   Conservative Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva joined Soares ona tour of the fire scene. Cavaco, an economist by training, saidthe city will have to make ``a major effort'' to rebuild the areaand create employment for the estimated 2,000 people who lost theirjobs.   Fire department Maj. Anibal Matos Silveira said the fire couldsmolder for several more days because of the wooden structures inthe buildings and the highly combustible materials in the shops.   Hundreds of volunteer firefighters from towns and industrialsuburbs outside Lisbon poured into the city to help fight the blazeas crowds of people gathered in the central Rossio Square to watch.</TEXT></DOC>
