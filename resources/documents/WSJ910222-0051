Technology had already been created to record six timesmore information on widely used magneto-optical computerdisks, a Sony spokesman said. But the research announcedyesterday means that the densely packed information can nowbe retrieved and read.</LP><TEXT>   Optical disks are typically used as substitutes for harddisks in personal computers but, like floppy disks, can beremoved.   Sony said the reading-technology uses conventional laserslike those now employed to read computer disks. But it saidthat &quot;if blue lasers can be developed in the future,&quot;existing disks may be able to hold 20 times as much data.Sony is conducting research on blue lasers, a spokesman said.   The new disk-reading technology will be introduced at theData Storage Topical Meeting scheduled for Feb. 25-27 inColorado Springs, Colo., Sony said.   The new technology allows a 5 1/4-inch disk to store asmuch as four gigabytes of information with conventionallasers, Sony said. A gigabyte is one billion bytes, orcharacters of information.   The development is called IRISTER technology, for IrisThermal Eclipse Reading, Sony said.</TEXT></DOC>
