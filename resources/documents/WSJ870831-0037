Florida, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and California are challenging the five-year program, under which 56% of the nation's 1.4 billion-acre outer continental shelf can be considered for oil and gas drilling. Also suing to stop the program are nine environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace.    In the suits, which were filed in the U.S. Appeals Court here, the states and environmental groups said the Interior Department's environmental impact studies didn't adequately address potential harm to the offshore regions.    A spokesman for the Oregon attorney general's office also said the federal government hadn't properly consulted with his state, as the law requires, and hadn't taken into account the harmful impact of offshore drilling on the fishing industry.    But the Interior Department said the plan, which took effect earlier this summer, balances preservation with the nation's need for additional energy. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has been an outspoken advocate of curbing U.S. reliance on imported oil. </TEXT></DOC>
