Robert Abboud has tentatively raised about 70% of the $500 million needed in his effort to recapitalize First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc., according to officials close to the federally assisted restructuring effort for the bank holding company.    But it is increasingly likely that the complicated transaction, the third-largest federal bailout of a financial institution, might not be completed before year end as planned.    As previously reported, the timetable for completing the deal this year is already at least two weeks behind schedule. The Securities and Exchange Commission hasn't yet approved documents that would clear the way for exisiting shareholders of the Houston-based bank holding company to vote on the proposed recapitalization. And a notice for a stockholder meeting hasn't been issued.    Officials handling the transactions say the delay won't jeopardize the bailout in any way, though it may raise some questions involving First City's use of certain tax benefits.    High risk, low-rated securities offerings are being shunned in financial markets since the October stock market crash, and analysts and investors have been skeptical about the ability of Mr. Abboud and investment banker, Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., to quickly raise the $500 million. But officials close to the money-raising effort, estimate that so far the Abboud group has received commitments to privately raise a total of about $362.5 million, mostly from major U.S. pension funds and insurance companies.    Included in that sum is a $225 million issue of a new First City preferred. Donaldson Lufkin and Mr. Abboud, a former Chicago banker, are now working on selling a $275 million issue of First City common, of which about half has been spoken for by individual investors and institutions, investors say. Of the $500 million offering, officials close to the transaction say that about 25% of the money will be raised from overseas investors, mostly in Western Europe and Japan.    Under terms of the Abboud plan, First City would receive nearly $1.5 billion in assistance; at least $500 million from the Abboud group and a $970 million note from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Existing First City holders, whose holdings would be nearly wiped out, would participate in a rights offering to raise an additional $86 million.    The complex recapitalization plan has drawn SEC scrutiny, partly because providing existing First City holders with rights to buy common shares could be considered a public offering. Similarly, while the $500 million in new stock will be placed privately, a public market for those shares will be created 120 days after the transaction closes.    By placing the bulk of the funds privately, Donaldson Lufkin had hoped to avoid a time-consuming SEC review. But the agency apparently is treating it as it would an initial public offering.    A federal official said that Friday is the earliest First City's proxy materials could be approved by the SEC. &quot;It's getting to be nip and tuck&quot; noting that the bailout would be &quot;a lot cleaner and simpler&quot; if completed by year end.    &quot;I don't think it will close by year end,&quot; another official close to the transaction said. &quot;That's not good. It's not making anybody happy.&quot; Indeed, a 1988 closing could cost First City some tax savings based on First City's string of prior net losses. It isn't clear how much, if any, of the savings would evaporate because of recent tax law changes, but officials say a delayed transaction could raise some questions with the Internal Revenue Service.    Mr. Abboud, who has been traveling in the U.S. and Europe seeking investors, declined to comment on his progress in putting the deal together, citing the SEC's review of proxy materials. He previously said that he doesn't expect any major problems in eventually completing the bailout, and he has indicated that any tax issues could be worked out with the IRS if the closing is postponed.    ---   Jeff Bailey contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
