An estimated 200,000 people took part. Many carried candlesthrough the darkened winter streets around Karl Marx Platz for 15minutes after a memorial service for those mistreated during whatnow is called ``the intolerance of the past.''   In September and early October, reformers were beaten and jailedfor taking part in protests.   ADN, the official news agency, put the crowd at more than100,000, but an Associated Press reporter in Leipzig estimated thetotal at 200,000.   Demonstrations also were reported in other East German cities.ADN said about 30,000 people marched through Karl-Marx-Stadt, atfirst silently but then with growing chants of ``Germany, UnitedFatherland!''   At Halle, opposition speakers were booed when they spoke againstreunification, the agency said. It did not say how many peopledemonstrated.   Several hundred candle-bearing demonstrators marched silentlythrough central East Berlin to commemorate victims of Stalinism andabout 3,000 people demonstrated for a clean environment inSchwerin, it said.   Leipzig church leaders and protest organizers had askeddemonstrators to be silent this week, and most marchers honored thecall for a solemn memorial.   Recent Monday night protests aimed at keeping pressure on theCommunist-dominated government for more democratic change escalatedinto shouting matches between supporters of saving a sovereign EastGermany and a growing minority seeking reunification with WestGermany.   Isolated groups of reunification advocates disrupted the silentmarch at times with shouts of ``Germany, United Fatherland.'' Butthey were quickly hushed by others who whistled their disapprovalor implored them to cease chanting.   There were no speeches by organizers at the march, another breakwith a tradition that has made the Leipzig event a forum for airinggrievances and proposals.   A few signs on the march route expressed solidarity withpro-democracy movements in other East European nations, especiallyin hard-line Romania.   ``Freedom also for Romania,'' declared one sign.   The discipline exhibited by most marchers was likely a result ofleaflets distributed in advance of the event by Leipzig conductorKurt Masur, a respected leader of the reform effort.   ``The whole of Europe hopes along with us that the futureLeipzig Monday demonstrations after Jan. 8 will continue peacefullyas has been the case until now, and that the great idea of a unitedEurope can become reality,'' Masur wrote. ``We Germans will in thisway naturally grow together and retain the trust of our neighbors.''   Activists have decided against holding protests on the next twoMondays because of the Christmas and New Year's holidays.   Despite the appeals, about 200 participants tried to stir up thegathering.   ``Free elections'' and ``One United Germany'' were among thepolitical slogans hoisted by those who broke the silence.   Some people in the crowd said they suspected the ultra-rightistWest German Republicans party had infiltrated the marches to raisethe issue of reunification.   A young student from Dresden said she had been fearful of aconfrontation, as the demonstration last Monday was ``a little tooaggressive.''   ``I was really afraid, but I'm very glad that this went off sopeacefully,'' said the woman, who did not give her name.   Worries about a turn toward violence and a rift in the reformmovement mounted after last week's demonstration reached a feverpitch, but there were no reports of incidents Monday.   The rally's exceptional solemnity was not expected to dampenpopular sentiment for reunification.   ``It would all have been in vain if we don`t become a unifiedfatherland again,'' one elderly demonstrator told West Germany`sZDF television network.   ``I am for a unified Germany. I am prepared to wait, but Icannot wait too long,'' said another, younger participant.   Leipzig was a hotbed of the democratic movement that forced EastGermany's Communist leaders to open the borders Nov. 9 andrelinquish much of their power.   Among the reasons for Leipzig's role are a strong churchmovement that served as rallying point for democracy activists whenauthorities still had tight control over dissent, and the seriousdeterioration of the city.</TEXT></DOC>
