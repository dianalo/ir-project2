 After all, the relationalmodel has been universally adopted and basic research is now in its finalphase, as definitions and working requirements are known and beingcommercially specified.andM;Indeed, the concentration on SQL as the standard data access language hasfurther speeded the convergence of commercial databases.andP;  The maindistinguishing factor for databases will soon relate to the range ofplatforms on which they have been implemented, rather than any internalcapabilities.andM;There are several key developments in the pipeline that will cause databasedevelopers to not only alter the way they think of their data and thedevelopment of their systems, but also their system hardware configurationstoo.andP;  The two principal concepts concern object-oriented programming on onehand and the concept of distributed systems built round database engines anddatabase servers on the other.andM;Object-oriented programming is currently receiving attention from softwaredevelopers and has much to offer database technology.andP;  It breaks down thefundamental distinction between the way data and data processing are handledand in doing so overcomes one of the problems of relational databases (andother standard applications development tools) where data handling, the userinterface and screen output and manipulation are essentially left to the whimof a particular programmer.andP;  In the hands of project development teams thiscan make software development an ill-defined scramble.andM;An OODBMS allows the programming detail to be an encapsulated as the methodto be applied to its associated data.andP;  Not just as at the time of data orreport entry, but any time it's wanted.andM;What is thought-provoking is the realization that the object is in essence adatabase record, with each statement being a field, and each record linked toits processing definition (record) by its type.andM;Add the requirements of referential integrity, an increasingly recognizedcharacteristic required of a database system and ideally met with by theOODBMS concept.andP;  Stir in a lot of other data processing (as opposed todatabase storage) concerns, then top up with the coming spread of distributedprocessing, and the whole concept of associating data with its processingwithin the database becomes a very powerful one.andP;  For example, eachprocessing definition or object, if treated as a data record, can be subjectto the access and modification permissions in the database facilities.andM;We have, in the last few months, seen almost the routing of the oldproprietary 'locked-in' approach to transaction processign hardware.andP;  Inparallel with this has been the development of powerful database systemscapable of presenting the same user/programmer interface across a large rangeof Unix and MS-DOS systems.andP;  This portability has made the next logical steppossible, namely the division of the basic front-end database program intosingle central database engine and numerous database server modules that willactually run on the user's desktop hardware and manage all the screen layoutsand data presentation.andM;The database engine (DBE) is simply a program that handles all the databasemanagement needs for a group of users.andP;  Typically this is all the datalook-ups, saves, deletes and modifies.andP;  It can run on any networkconfiguration and will probably be located either on the most powerfulhardware, or on the hardware with the most direct access to hte central datastore.andM;The station that runs that DBE software is known as the database server (DBS)and its job is to wait for requests from the various users on the network.andO;Once received, the DBE fulfills that request and passes the information orerror message back to the user.andP;  The important factor is that all the recordmanipulation is done on the server already chosen as the most powerful andsuitable processor on the network.andM;The immediate benefits are clear: increased speed and efficiency of the wholedatabase operation.andP;  The DBS concept takes the burden of processing away fromthe user's desktop workstations.andP;  They are now just left to manage the screenand data display activities and to parcel up the requests for the enginewhich are sent down the network using the standard NetBios.andM;These two developments in particular mean that database development willcontinue to be at the sharp end of software technology, with no let-up in thepace.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
