CSX said the sale of CSX Oil andamp; Gas Corp. is expected to be completed within 30 days and will leave the company focused on its primary transportation, pipeline, property and technology business groups, though it will keep its major natural gas liquids plants in the U.S.    Total Minatome, a Houston-based subsidiary of Total Cie. Francaise des Petroles, Paris, said the purchase would permit it to expand its operations in the U.S. and the North Sea. CSX Oil andamp; Gas, also based in Houston, is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production in Texas, Louisiana and the North Sea.    CSX, based in Richmond, Va., said it plans to use proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes, which may include efforts to reduce its railroad work force, and possibly some repayment of debt. CSX's long-term debt totaled $3.16 billion as of Dec. 31, which represented a decline from $3.8 billion at the end of 1986.    Analysts said CSX might use the money to offer voluntary severance payments in an effort to reach its previously disclosed goal of cutting 12,000 jobs, about 30% of its railroad work force. The company is negotiating with rail unions to make sweeping changes in labor practices; in return, CSX would give bonuses tied to gains in productivity.    The proceeds give CSX &quot;a comfortable war chest for its dealings with rail labor,&quot; Henry Livingston, a transportation analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., said. &quot;CSX wants 12,000 jobs out, and they won't come cheap.&quot;    Analysts were impressed by the sale price. &quot;It's a very attractive return on those assets,&quot; said Graeme Lidgerwood, a transportation analyst at First Boston Corp., who previously had predicted that CSX would sell the unit for $350 million to $400 million.    CSX shares closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $31.25, up $1.50, while the overall market was flat.    Last January, CSX said it was conducting a review to see whether its oil and gas business fit into its long-term strategic objectives. In 1987, the oil and gas business -- including the natural gas liquids plants -- generated revenue of $226.8 million, or about 2.8% of CSX's $8.04 billion in total revenue. The company didn't specify the share of revenue generated by the natural gas liquids plants that it is keeping.    The company said in its annual report that effective cost controls and emphasis on low-risk exploration enabled CSX Oil andamp; Gas to rebound from a 1986 operating loss of $2 million to a 1987 operating profit of $2 million.    The oil and gas holdings being sold also require major investment. Jean-Pierre Donnet, president and chief executive officer of Total Minatome, said a CSX Oil andamp; Gas discovery in the North Sea &quot;has to be developed and will involve substantial investment.&quot; One analyst said CSX would have faced a prospective cash outlay of nearly $200 million in October for its share of development costs of some North Sea oil properties. A CSX spokesman, though he didn't confirm that development figure, said the company didn't decide to sell CSX Oil andamp; Gas because of any requirement to make big capital outlays. </TEXT></DOC>
