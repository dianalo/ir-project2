AFRICA BEGIN TALKS TO END SANCTIONS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Bush and his aides believe that those tests have already been met and, onthe domestic front, will be moving to convince Congress of that.;    Theadministration push to end the sanctions comes in the wake of Monday's repealby South Africa of the last major apartheid law, the Population RegistrationAct. Administration discussions with the South Africans now focus on the issueof political prisoners. The administration is seeking to build a case thatSouth Africa has, in fact, released all those who meet the White House'sdefinition of a person jailed for a &quot;political&quot; offense.;    At most, fewerthan 100 prisoners may remain in the &quot;gray area&quot; of people jailed for actsthat were partially political, the official said.;    By contrast, the AfricanNational Congress and anti-apartheid groups in the United States argue thatseveral thousand prisoners remain jailed.;    The difference in views stemsfrom the administration's refusal to consider as &quot;political prisoners&quot; thosepeople who were convicted of violent acts. The ANC argues that many of thosepeople were politically motivated.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910619  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  260  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 19, 199100171152,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
