But many Americans believe that ifhe were to succeed in extending his control to a large partof the Arab world, he could severely damage the oil-dependentU.S. economy. No less an authority than Henry Kissinger hasclaimed that an unchecked Saddam would be able to &quot;cause aworld-wide economic crisis.&quot;   But is it true that Saddam Hussein can impose large costson our economy? Economic analysis of the oil market answerswith a resounding, No. The annual cost to the U.S. economy ofdoing nothing in the Gulf would be less than half of 1% ofthe gross national product. The vaunted oil weapon is a dud.</LP><TEXT>   One thing Saddam cannot do is cause oil shortages andgasoline lines. Only the U.S. government can do that. As longas the government avoids imposing price controls, any cutbackin supplies that Saddam causes will translate into higherprices, not shortages. That is the lesson learned from the1970s. Countries like the U.S. that impose price controlscaused Soviet-style queues. Countries like Switzerland thatavoided price controls made it through the 1970s with nolines.   ---   That's no surprise. If governments let oil prices rise,people eliminate marginal uses while continuing to use oilwhere it is most valuable. They take fewer trips to thestores and fewer driving vacations, but don't stop driving towork. Utilities switch from oil to natural gas. Peopleinsulate their houses and close off unused room. In athousand different ways, oil users make subtle adjustmentsthat -- voila -- cause the amount they consume to equalexactly the amount supplied. The market works.   Of course, Saddam does not have to create gasoline linesto hurt the U.S. Increases in the price of oil, even withoutshortages, hurt the U.S. economy. But they hurt less thanmost people think.   Take the worst case that has any plausibility whatsoever.Assume that Iraq holds onto Kuwait and grabs Saudi Arabiaplus the United Arab Emirates. Iraq would then controlvirtually all Middle Eastern oil production, except forIran's.   The Middle Eastern oil fields had been producing about12.3 million barrels per day before the price run-up in lateJuly. They will go on producing something: Saddam may beevil, but he is not stupid. He does not want to seize the oilfields only to leave them idle. He wants them so that he cansell their oil.   If Saddam sold the same 12.3 million barrells per day aswere being sold before the invasion of Kuwait, the effect ofhis actions on the world price of oil would be zero. Oilwould sell for the pre-crisis price of about $20 per barrel.   ---   Obviously, Saddam doesn't intend to sell the same level ofoutput. By controlling the outputs of four major OPEC cartelmembers Saddam would gain monopoly power over Persian Gulfoil. He would no doubt use this power to cut the combinedproduction to drive up the world price of oil. Therevenue-maximizing level of output from the Persian Gulffields is no less than 8.3 million barrels a day -- a 4million barrells per day production cut.   That is less awesome than it sounds. Remember that Saddamis operating in a market in which world output is about 60million barrels per day. The loss of 4 million barrels isthus a 6.7% cut in world output. Granted that in theshort-run the demand for oil is fairly inelastic. Small cutsin production can therefore cause large increases in worldprices. Adopting the grimmest end of the economists' range ofestimates of elasticity, a 6.7% cut in world production wouldcause a 35% rise in price, to about $27 per barrel from thepre-crisis price of $20.   Before the crisis, the U.S. was importing about 8 millionbarrels of oil a day. If the U.S. were to import the sameamount rather than increasing domestic production or reducingconsumption, it would pay $56 million per day extra for itsimports. This amounts to $20.5 billion per year.   Now $20.5 billion is not small change. But put the figureinto perspective. It is less than 1/2 of 1% of America's $5trillion GNP. A loss of 1/2 of 1% of GNP is surely not whatHenry Kissinger had in mind when he referred to an &quot;economiccrisis.&quot;   At the gasoline pump, the cost would show up as an added17 per gallon on top of the old price of about $1.09 -- atotal of about $1.26, less than motorists are paying now.Total cost per American per year of the price hike would beless than $80.   ---   Consider, by contrast, the costs of war. Sending troops tothe Gulf has not been cheap. The U.S. spent an estimated $2billion extra in the first two weeks of the operation.Staying there a year, or fighting, would probably cost muchmore than $20.5 billion in added spending. Nor is thisspending the only cost of intervening, as the plight of thehostages makes clear.   Remember also that the U.S. embargo of Kuwait and Iraqensures that less oil will be produced. As a result, oilprices will stay high, which is presumably one of theoutcomes the administration wanted to prevent.   The $20.5 billion tax that Saddam can levy on the Americaneconomy is only a short-run cost. The longer he restricts oilproduction, the less annual damage he can inflict. At thehigher price of oil, other oil producers will produce more,as is already happening. Moreover, according to energyeconomists Arlon Tussing and Sam Van Vactor, at $25 perbarrel, many subsititutes for oil become economicallyfeasible. The bottom line: Whatever other justificationsthere may be for war with Saddam, cheap oil isn't one ofthem.   ---   Mr. Henderson, the energy economist on President Reagan'sCouncil of Economic Advisers, is a fellow with the NationalCenter for Policy Analysis in Dallas.
