The Soviet first lady, normally known for her fashionableclothes, surprised Italians with her austere look and few changesof clothes during a three-day state visit to Italy.   Contrary to the hopes of many Milanese designers, Mrs. Gorbachevdid not go shopping in Via della Spiga, Milan's fashion boulevard.Shopping in the luxury, downtown street of this northern city wasnot part of her official program but had been considered likely.   Instead, the enthusiasm of swelling crowds, which slowed down ancrowded schedule for Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife in Italy'seconomic capital, forced her to cut short her private tour.   Mrs. Gorbachev joined her husband for his historic meeting withPope John Paul II at the Vatican wearing a red dress and goingagainst normal protocol of dressing in black. She changed,apparently on the flight to Milan, into a business-like greenoutfit.   Hundreds of Milanese, including city art superintendent RosalbaTardito, waited in vain for Mrs. Gorbachev in chilly weatheroutside Santa Maria delle Grazie church, in whose refectoryLeonardo da Vinci painted ``The Last Supper.''   The visit to the fresco was canceled at the last minute becauseMrs. Gorbachev had been running behind the schedule after payinghomage to the Milanese home of the late Soviet artist Nicola Benois.   About 300 people shouted ``Raisa! Raisa!'' when Mrs. Gorbachevlaid a bouquet of flowers below a marble plaque dedicated toBenois, who had worked for several years with Milan's La Scalaopera house after leaving his native country.</TEXT></DOC>
