It is shown that the transport propertiesin these melts can be explained in suggestion of complexing of ions notonly in mixtures but also in individual salts. The bond energy of theions in the complexes ({Delta}U/sub MX(sub N(n1))/) can be characteristicof their transition from one complex group to another. Contribution ofthe ion exchange between the complexes to transport phenomena dependson temperature and the ionic composition of melts. It grows considerablyin going from lithium to cesium halides and from alkali metal chloridesto their iodides. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
