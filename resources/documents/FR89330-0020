(``PepsiCo''), and General Cinema Corporation (``GCC'') an agreementcontaining a proposed consent order.The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty(60) days for reception of comments from interested persons. Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)days, the Commission will again review the agreement and comments received,and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make finalthe agreement's order.The Commission's investigation of this matter concerns the proposed acquisitionby PepsiCo of one of its leading independent Pepsi bottlers with seventeenwholly-owned bottling subsidiaries. PepsiCo is a soft drink concentratemanufacturer. PepsiCo supplies Pepsi brand syrup or concentrate to a numberof bottlers, including GCC, that also bottle competing soft drink brandsin a nunber of local markets in the United States.The agreement containing the proposed consent order would, if issued bythe Commission, settle the complaint. The complaint allegs that PepsiCo'sacquisition of GCC's bottling operations in Broward County, Florida, anda six-county area in and around Staunton, Virginia (``Staunton area'')would substantially lessen competition in all or branded carbonated softdrinks in those two areas, and would violate section 7 of the Clayton Actand section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effectiveremedy eliminates the anticiompetitive effects. The Staunton area includesthe following counties or portion of counties: Augusta, Rockingham, Page,Highland, Shenandoah, and Nelson. Broward County is served by GCC throughGeneral Cinema Beverages of Miami, Inc.; the Staunton area is served byGCC through Geneal Cinema Beverages of Virginia, Inc., and General CinemaBeverages of Staunton, Inc.Because GCC has the right to distribute non-Pepsi brands in these territoriesin which there are competing Pepsi bottlers, absent the Commission's order,PepsiCo would be both a bottler of other soft drink brands as well as asupplier to its Pepsi bottler in the same market. As a result, direct competitionbetween bottlers of Pepsi and non-Pepsi brands may be lessened and therisk of inter-brand collusion would be increased in these markets.The proposed consent order requires PepsiCo and GCC to finalize and executeagreements that will permit GCC to continue to distribute Dr Pepper, Barq'sand Mountain Dew soft drink brands in the Staunton area, and Dr Pepper,Seven-Up, Barq's and Sunkist soft drink brands in Broward County.The proposed order accepted by the Commission for public comment also containsa requirement that GCC seeks prior Commission approval for a period often-years from the date of the order becomes final, before assigning ortransferring any of its soft drink rights in Broward County or the Stauntonarea. PepsiCo is prohibited from acquiring carbonated soft drink assetsor operations in Broward County of the Staunton area without prior approvalfrom the Commission for a five-year period after the order becomes final.Also, for a ten-year period after the order becomes final, PepsiCo is requiredto notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days in advance of any proposedacquisition that would result in PepsiCo becoming the bottler or distributorof one or more non-Pepsi brands in any geographic area in the United Statesin which PepsiCo would not also own or operate the bottler or distributorof Pepsi brands.It is anticipated that the provisions of the propsed order would resolvethe competitive problems alleged in the complaint. The purpose of thisanalysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order in orderto assist the Commission in its determination to make final the order containedin the agreement.This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the agreement and the proposed order or to modify its terms in any way.<ITAG tagnum="6">Benjamin I.
