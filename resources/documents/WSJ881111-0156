On Election Night, just as George Bush was carrying Congress to the Honeymoon Suite, she bit him on the neck.    Both of the top Senate Republican leaders, Bob Dole and Alan Simpson, went on a succession of national television broadcasts to announce the &quot;inevitability&quot; of &quot;revenue enhancement&quot; -- a term that apparently includes every form of tax increase except for rate adjustments.    For his part, Sen. Dole blamed Mr. Bush for the net Republican loss of at least one Senate seat. Sen. Simpson, after heralding the liberal National Economic Commission, called for the convening of a bipartisan panel of congressional leadership to deal with the deficit. No one is quite sure where this brainstorm arose, but it looks suspiciously similar to Dan Quayle's idea of convening a cabinet meeting immediately after ascending to the presidency.    There is one grace note here: Fortunately, Mr. Bush chose Mr. Quayle as his running mate, rather than either of these gentlemen. Any downside that selection of Mr. Quayle may have initially had on the ticket is &quot;small potatoes&quot; compared with what would have happened had runningmate Dole or Simpson endorsed tax increases in the middle of the campaign -- an act that would have painted George Bush as not only a liar, but a cynical manipulator of the political process as well.    But it is important that the accusations leveled by Sens. Dole and Simpson not go unchallenged.    Mr. Bush won by a wide margin because he was able to successfully use conservative issues to paint Michael Dukakis as a liberal. Senate Republicans lost because they have adamantly refused to force votes on the types of issues that would allow them to paint their opposition in the same light.    Let's look at the issues the voters viewed as important: According to an ABC exit poll, 32% of the electorate viewed abortion as an important issue, and those who did went substantially for Mr. Bush. Twenty-six percent thought the death penalty was an important issue, and 26% felt the proliferation of illicit drugs was important. Those polls are not surprising; Republican polls from the beginning of the year had predicted that &quot;drugs&quot; and &quot;crime&quot; would be two watershed issues in the 1988 elections.    The &quot;furlough issue,&quot; coupled with the vice president's public stand on abortion, sent a signal to voters that Mr. Bush was better than Mr. Dukakis on the three issues they considered most important.    What did Senate Republicans do on these issues? Well, basically, they incorporated all of their crime- and drug-related proposals into a &quot;bipartisan drug package,&quot; which, I assure you, contained far more items from the Democrats' &quot;wish list&quot; than from the Republicans'.    Is it any wonder that, through two successive presidential landslides and in an era of almost unprecedented Republican popularity, Senate Republicans have continued to lose ground?    These Democrats will come to the Senate on Jan. 3 with a long list of issues designed to give them an electoral advantage. These include minimum-wage increases, parental-leave legislation, labor-law &quot;reform,&quot; election-law &quot;reform,&quot; child-care legislation, antitrust legislation, and so on. If the Republicans respond to these proposals with bipartisan &quot;compromises&quot; that incorporate 10% of the Republican agenda and 90% of the Democrat agenda, I predict that the 1990 elections will once again take Senate Republicans below 40 seats.    The only way Republicans can avert a debacle in 1990 is to develop their own electorally attuned agenda and push it with the same dogged determination as the Democrats have employed in pursuing their agenda.    ---   Mr. Weyrich is president of the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
