Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to restructure the Soviet economy, known as perestroika, have triggered a surge in Soviet orders for machine tools like the ones that Mr. Ehmann's Traub AG makes. &quot;The interest in our machines has really revived,&quot; says Mr. Ehmann. Sales of Traub's sophisticated turret lathes will rise fivefold this year, he predicts, to about 40 million marks ($22 million).    But expanding links between West German machine-tool makers and customers behind the Iron Curtain are arousing security worries. U.S. officials have voiced concern about growing pressure from European nations to ease technology sales to the East bloc.    Machine tools grind, cut and shape metal; they can be used to make a better car or a better tank. The more sophisticated the machine, the greater the potential security risk. This was illustrated in the case involving a Toshiba Corp. subsidiary's sale of machine-tool technology that may have enabled the Soviets to build submarines better able to evade detection.    While acknowledging that potential, some West German tool makers chafe under Western restrictions. Watching a computer-driven lathe turn raw metal into a precision part, Mr. Ehmann concedes the risk. But, he argues, &quot;the deeper the cooperation between us, the more controllable the Soviets are.&quot;    Chancellor Helmut Kohl's summit meeting in Moscow last month focused attention on West Germany's growing business ties to the East. While most of German industry anxiously awaits an upturn in Soviet trade, the machine-tool sector is already experiencing it. Bonn is Moscow's leading Western supplier of machine tools. Deliveries this year should rise 15% as the Soviets seek to improve factory efficiency.    U.S. officials say that in contrast to several Western nations, including France and Japan, the West Germans have a good record in enforcing the regulations of Cocom, the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, which sets rules for technology transfers to Communist nations. Traub, for instance, offers two product catalogs: one for customers in the West and one -- much slimmer -- for customers in the East.    Yet while most companies abide by the Cocom list prohibiting the sale of highly specialized machine tools, some suppliers sidestep the restrictions.    &quot;There are ways around the rules,&quot; says one West German executive. His company hasn't engaged in the practice, he says, but adds that he knows of competitors that have shipped embargoed technology to the Soviet Union via intermediaries in Sweden or Switzerland, which aren't part of Cocom.    Says one U.S. official: &quot;As the volume of shipments to the East increases, so does the chance of something slipping through.&quot; When a high-ranking U.S. delegation, led by U.S. State Department Cocom chief Allan Wendt, visited Bonn recently, the topic of machine tools was high on the agenda. &quot;It's an area we're concerned about,&quot; the U.S. official adds.    Some German machine-tool makers say Cocom rules are too restrictive. &quot;The restrictions are getting more and more ridiculous every day,&quot; says Reiner Lang, owner of Heinemann G.m.b.H., a machine-tool maker in Baden-Wuerttemberg that operates a joint venture in the Soviet Union. Mr. Lang, whose office features a bust of Lenin, says the discrepancy between products covered and not covered is &quot;total nonsense.&quot;    &quot;We're selling airplanes to the East bloc,&quot; he says. &quot;There is certainly more sensitive technology in an airplane than there is in a machine tool.&quot;    Soviet interest in German machine tools particularly benefits the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which accounts for 70% of Germany's machine-tool output. Michael Hagenmeyer, an official in Baden-Wuerttemberg's Economics Ministry who handles trade relations with the Soviet Union, estimates that as many as 300 companies in his state have &quot;vigorous&quot; trade links with the Soviet Union.    &quot;Trade with the Soviet Union always seems to move in either boom or bust cycles,&quot; adds Horst Bohrer, sales director at Liebherr Verzahntechnik G.m.b.H., a Bavarian maker of gear-cutting machines. After three years without a single Soviet order, Mr. Bohrer says, &quot;All of a sudden we seem to be entering a boom phase.&quot;    That's a common refrain. German businessmen see Mr. Gorbachev's attempts to modernize the Soviet economy as a potential gold mine. Fifty prominent German businessmen traveled with Chancellor Kohl to Moscow, one of the largest private groups ever to accompany a Bonn contingent abroad. And, because of government support and centuries of business involvement in Russia, German companies have a leg up on their Western rivals. </TEXT></DOC>
