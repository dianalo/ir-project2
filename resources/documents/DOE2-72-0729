Complex compositions,oxidation degree of ruthenium in them and donor atoms in ligands areestablished. The supposition about the structure of compounds is stated.Ruthenium in the acetic acid medium is susceptible to complexing withnitrogen of thioamide group, osmium, as a softer acid, - with sulfur.</TEXT></DOC>
