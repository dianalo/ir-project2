Canada said later it would temporarily store the polychlorinatedbiphenyls, or PCBs, in Quebec province.   The freighter Nadezhda Obukhova prepared to head back to Canadaon Thursday with a cargo of PCBs, loaded at Montreal. They had beendestined for destruction by a high-temperature incinerator in southWales.   The Mersey Docks and Harbor Co., backing longshore leaders,refused to handle the cargo after the Greenpeace environmental groupsucceeded in blocking another PCB cargo at a Tilbury in southEngland port, Tilbury.   Tilbury turned away the consignment, also from Canada, afterprotesters attached a skull and crossbones banner to the freighterwhile television crews filmed from launches and helicopters.   British newspapers have taken up the issue, with mass circulationdailies carrying such headlines as ``Ship of Shame.''   London's liberal Observer, usually sympathetic to Greenpeace,accused it this week of ``going overboard.''   Greenpeace is trying to block 15 consignments of PCBs from Canadathat the British disposal company Rechem has contracted to handle atits South Wales plant in coming weeks.   The company says it will ``defend its position.''   In Quebec, Canada's environment minister, Lise Bacon, announcedWednesday evening that will be put in a Hydro-Quebec storagefacility in the province. She said the PCBs will be taken to Manic2, a power generating station about 20 miles west of Baie-Comeau,Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's hometown.   ``This is a temporary solution as our goal is to dispose of thetoxic wastes,'' Ms. Bacon told a news conference.   PCBs, which were used primarily to cool electrical transformers,have been banned in North America because of links with cancer.Government officials say Britain has the techniques to dispose ofthe cargoes and has strict safety regulations for how they can beimported.   Greenpeace spokesman Tim Birch, waiting with 100 protesters whenthe freighter docked at Liverpool's Royal Seaforth containerterminal Wednesday, said Britain was ``encouraging the global toxicwaste crisis'' by allowing the imports.   Canada's only incinerator capable of handling PCBs is in Albertaand does not accept waste from other provinces. For two years,Canada has sent PCB waste from various sources to Britain fordestruction at its three licensed toxic-waste incinerators.</TEXT></DOC>
