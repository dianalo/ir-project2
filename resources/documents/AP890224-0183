Officials in London said Britain asked Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze to press the Iranian patriarch, AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini, to lift his command that followers kill SalmanRushdie, author of the novel Moslems call blasphemous.   News reports said police gunfire wounded 40 people during theBombay protest by about 5,000 people after midday Moslem prayers andthat 11 police officers were injured. Police said they arrested 300demonstrators.   The protesters ignored a ban on assembly of more than five peoplein public places Friday, the Moslem sabbath. A police spokesman saidthey set fire to several buses and other vehicles and attackedpolice.   Police imposed the ban after some Moslems announced plans todemonstrate against the book, which they say is blasphemous.   Reports of the death toll conflicted. Press Trust said 12 peoplewere killed, United News of India put it at 10, and PoliceCommissioner S.M. Shangari said eight had died. Two deaths initiallyattributed to the violence were caused by unrelated road accidents,he said.   Demonstrations also were reported in the Indian cities of NewDelhi, Calcutta, Darjeeling, Varanasi, Patna and Siliguri. Noviolence was reported.   In New Delhi, about 400 Moslems marched to the British Embassy,and the city's 32-officer police force was put on alert.   India banned Rushdie's book in November, fearing it could sparksectarian unrest. More than 90 million Moslems live in India andmake up about 11 percent of the nation's population of 880 million.The novel also is banned in Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, Iranand Egypt.   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in Bombay in 1947. Now aBritish citizen, he has been under police guard in England sinceKhomeini first ordered Moslems on Feb. 14 to kill him. Iranianclerics have put a $5.2 million bounty on Rushdie's head.   In demonstrations Feb. 12-13, one person was killed in India andsix died in Pakistan, where police opened fire on a crowd thatattacked a U.S. diplomatic office.   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, urged Westerncountries to state clearly if they agree with the contents ofRushdie's novel.   Rafsanjani said Moslems want to know if Western governmentssupport what the book says about Islam ``so that we know what ourduty is regarding those who are a partner in cursing the prophet.''   ``The ground has been laid for a vast battle between Islam on theone hand, and paganism and arrogance on the other,'' Rafsanjani saidin the prayer sermon in Tehran, broadcast by the official IslamicRepublic News Agency and monitored in Cyprus.   British Foreign Office sources said Foreign Secretary SirGeoffrey Howe had written Shevardnadze urging him to tell Khomeinithat ``the Soviet Union shares the international community's wish tosee Iran respect international obligations and renounce the use ofviolence.''   Shevardnadze, on a 10-day Middle East tour, will meet withKhomeini on Saturday in a rare audience with the religious patriarch.   The Soviet Ambassador to London, Leonid Zamyatin, said thecontroversy ``clearly shows the need for respect for religiousfeelings and traditions as well as tolerance for the politics andvalues of others.''   The 12 nations of the European Economic Community have recalledtheir envoys from Iran, and London has shut down its mission inTehran. Iran pulled its ambassadors out of the Common Market nations.   Nearly 2,000 Moslems rallied in Manchester in northern Britain onFriday and called for Rushdie's book to be withdrawn from libraryshelves. They waved placards and ripped a cardboard effigy ofRushdie to pieces.   Britain's home secretary, Douglas Hurd, said his country's750,000 Moslems were entitled to protest ``peacefully and withdignity'' against a book ``which they believe denigrates and insultsthe prophet of Islam.''   ``But to turn such protests toward violence or the threat ofviolence is wholly unacceptable,'' he told a meeting of Moslems inBirmingham.   Howe, in Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, wasthreatened with death by a man who called the Tokyo correspondentfor Britain's Guardian newspaper and said Howe ``won't leave Tokyoalive. ... He is a great infidel like Rushdie,'' the newspaper said.   In Istanbul, a man called The Associated Press and said U.S.embassies would be bombed. He said he spoke in the name of ``IslamicJihad for the Honor of Islam.'' Another caller said a bomb wasplaced at the British Council office in Istanbul but no bomb wasfound, police said. Istanbul Governor Cahit Bayar said securityprecautions were taken at foreign missions in the city. He did notelaborate.   Some Moslem priests in Turkey denounced Rushdie during theirFriday sermons and one said he should be killed, the Anatolia NewsAgency reported.   Many people in the predominantly Moslem country have said theydisapprove of ``The Satanic Verses,'' but others have opposedKhomeini's death threat.</TEXT></DOC>
