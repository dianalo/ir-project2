(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former executives of a UnitedTechnologies Corp. division pleaded guilty Friday to obtaininginside information from a Navy official about a defense contractcompetition.   James E. Rapinac, 54, a former senior vice president of theNorden Systems division, and C. J. ``Jack'' Richardson, 48, aformer Norden marketing executive, pleaded guilty to conspiracy todefraud the government.   They agreed to cooperate with the long-running investigation ofprocurement fraud and influence peddling, nicknamed ``Operation IllWind,'' that has netted convictions of 29 individuals and fourcorporations.   ``While I offer no excuses for my actions, I do believe thedefense acquisition process is conducive to abuses,'' Rapinac said.   Rapinac and Richardson each could face up to five years inprison and fines up to $250,000 when U.S. District Judge Claude M.Hilton sentences them March 9.   They admitted paying $27,500 to Washington defense consultantThomas E. Muldoon for inside information on the award of a MarineCorps contract to build a radar command and control system worth upto $150 million.   With the help of another defense consultant, Mark Saunders,Muldoon obtained information about the confidential selectionprocess being conducted by the Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCommand, according to court papers filed by the prosecution Friday.   Saunders got the information from George Stone, then a seniorprocurement official at the naval command, and gave it to Muldoonto be relayed to Rapinac and Richardson, according to the statementof facts filed by prosecutors in the case.   Muldoon provided information about how various Navy procurementboards ranked the proposals of competing defense companies and toldRapinac and Richardson what other companies were bidding, advisingNorden to lower its bid to $95 million, prosecutors said.   Neither Stone nor Saunders has been charged.   Muldoon, 59, was convicted Thursday for participating in ascheme by a Whittaker Corp. subsidiary to funnel bribes to a MarineCorps contracting official. He faces a possible 70-year prisonsentence on that conviction.   Prosecutors describe Muldoon as a major figure in the Pentagonprocurement scandal.   Norden abruptly withdrew from the competition in June, 1988,when the ``Ill Wind'' investigation became public, prosecutors said.   In a letter to employees, United Technologies Chairman Robert F.Daniell said the actions of the former Norden executives ``werewrong and violated clear company policies.''   ``This unfortunate occurrence compels me to remind all employeeswe are committed to upholding the law and maintaining the higheststandards of ethical conduct,'' Daniell said.   Company spokesman Dan Harrison said United Technologies iscooperating with the investigation.   Court papers said that Norden's president, Edward Deckerapproved the consulting agreement with Muldoon. But Harrison saidthat approval of all consulting agreements by the president wasstandard procedure and Decker did not authorize ``illegallyobtaining government information.''   Stone's attorney, Brian Gettings, called the allegations againsthis client ``a lot of hearsay.''   Also Friday, Hilton sentenced two former executives of aWhittaker Corp. subsidiary for participating in a scheme to bribe aMarine Corps procurement officer. Both pleaded guilty to briberycharges.   Scott M. Lamberth, 59, a former vice president of WhittakerCommand and Control Systems, received a 10-month sentence $10,000fine for his involvement in a scheme to funnel more than $80,000 tothe procurement official.   John Franklin Van Tassel, 53, who headed the company'sFayetteville, Ark., operation, was ordered to serve three months ina halfway house and fined $3,000.   The bribes were funneled to Jack A. Sherman through Muldoon andtwo other defense consultants. Sherman is serving an 18-monthprison term for participating in another bribery scheme.</TEXT></DOC>
