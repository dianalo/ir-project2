Moore and Co. of HuntingtonStation, N.Y., spearheaded the computerization effort in his small machineshop, he sampled a variety of products, including those for MS-DOS.andP;  For itsCAD/CAM machining center, Howard J. Moore decided on the family of productsfrom Gibbs and Associates.andP;  The Mac's graphics orientation played a role inthe decision.andM;&quot;The Mac is the easiest computer to use,&quot; Eric Moore said.andP;  &quot;With the Gibbssystem, everything is done on screen.andP;  I don't need any knowledge of NCprogramming -- G codes and all that -- I just draw the part.andP;  And featureslike simulation let me know exactly what I'm doing.&quot;andM;With the Mac, an experienced NC programmer like Hindman can generatenumerical control programs faster and more easily.andP;  And an experiencedmachinist like Eric Moore can generate NC programs without having to learn aprogramming language.andP;  All of this translates into productivity.andM;Visual Engineering's prototyping work can involve creating the parts of aproduct for test fitting, which is the building of tooling models or theproduction of short runs to develop manufacturing techniques for markettesting.andP;  &quot;We use MGMStation day in and day out, Hindman said, &quot;and we'resaving weeks in programming.&quot;andM;Typically a job will come in from a design company, often by modem, in theform of an initial graphic exchange specification (IGES) file, which is a CADindustry standard format.andP;  The drawing is transferred to MGMStation CAD toprepare it for the CAM sequence.andP;  The tool path is then programmed inMGMStation Milling and sent to milling machines for production.andM;&quot;We've cut week-long production schedules down to day-long schedules,&quot;Hindman said.andP;  &quot;Around here, we kid about putting in a drive-through window.&quot;andM;Howard J. Moore and Co. has experienced similar productivity gains.andP;  &quot;We makea lot of computer parts.&quot; said Eric Moore.andP;  &quot;I felt we should be usingcomputers to make them.&quot;andP;  The company uses Gibbs' ncCAD to draw up the parts,then generates the NC program in ncCAM.andP;  Gibbs' ncCommunication moduletransfers the program to a milling machine.andM;Now an experience user of the system, Eric Moore can really move the workout.andP;  &quot;I had to do a simple part that had 525 holes in a matrix,&quot; he said,recounting a recent job.andP;  &quot;The ncCAD software let me do it by specifying thelocation of three corner holes and the spacing between the 522 others.andP;  Ittook about 10 minutes.andP;  That's total time: CAD, CAM and post processing.andP;  Tenminutes from drawing to milling machine.&quot;andP;  A year and a half aftercomputerization, Eric Moore said of his system, &quot;I don't know what I would dowithout it.&quot;andM;Morrissey of Bridgeport Machines cited the Mac II as a factor in the upsurgein Mac CAM.andP;  Its expandability and bigger screen has, in his view, made adifference.andM;The increase in performance hasn't hurt, either.andP;  As an example Morrisseypoints to his own program that runs on both the Mac and MS-DOS machines.andO;According to Morrissey, MacEZ-CAM running on a Mac II will outperform the DOSversion running on a 16-MHz, '286 machine.andM;Despite the Mac II's horsepower, both Howard J. Moore and Visual Engineeringrely on Mac SEs.andP;  Eric Moore is satisfied with the performance of his system.andO;Rather than having more horsepower, his wish list is topped by a largerscreen and color.andP;  &quot;I'd like to see an SE-type system to which a colormonitor could be added,&quot; he said.andM;Hindman of Visual Engineering also expressed satisfaction with the power ofhis company's SEs.andP;  Visual Engineering does have one Macintosh II, though,and Hindman's hands-on experience with that machine has given him anappreciation of increased performance.andP;  He'd like to add more.andP;  &quot;In fact,&quot; hesaid, &quot;now that they're out, make that IIxes.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
