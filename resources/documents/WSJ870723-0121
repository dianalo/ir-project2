The market's leading barometer, the Nikkei stock average, fell 375.62 points to 22702.74, slipping below 23000 for the first time in about three months. The Nikkei has fallen more than 1300 points during its four-day plunge and took its third biggest point fall in a single day, 654.81, on Monday.    In the first half of the year, one of the greatest bull markets in Tokyo stock market history took place amid cheap oil, low interest rates and an appreciating Japanese yen. Now, oil prices are rising, bond prices are falling in Japan, driving up yields, and the yen has weakened markedly against the dollar.    &quot;The background of this summer correction is rather clear,&quot; says a First Boston Corp. study. &quot;The fundamental conditions which have been supporting the bull market over the last 18 months seem to be changing.&quot;    Still, while many investors and analysts expect the downward pressure to continue for a few weeks, few think the bottom is falling out of the market.    &quot;The market has been waiting for a technical correction before it gets back on a surer footing,&quot; says Naoya Ozawa, head of equity research at James Capel andamp; Co.    Meanwhile, in the past five sessions volume has been extremely thin at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, running no higher than 500 million shares. Yesterday's tally was just 400 million shares. The shrinking daily turnover, along with falling stock prices, prompted the exchange to relax a requirement on margins, or good faith deposits, for trades.    The change, which took effect yesterday, allows stocks used as collateral in margin transactions to be rated at 70% of their value, up from 50%. The total value of all collateral still must equal 70% of the transaction.    The move lifted prices briefly yesterday morning. However, brokers and analysts don't expect the change to have much immediate impact on the sagging market.    Easing margin requirements during a correction &quot;won't be very useful now,&quot; Mr. Ozawa says, although the effects may be felt later in the summer.    Because Japan is one of the world's largest net importers of oil, especially from the Middle East and members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, there is growing concern among investors about rising oil prices and the inflationary side effects.    For instance, chemical issues fell yesterday amid concern about higher prices for petrochemical materials. Mitsubishi Chemical dropped 26 yen to 964 yen ($6.34), Sanyo Chemical eased 40 to 1300, and Shinetsu Chemical was down 40 at 1850.    Power utility stocks, a popular sector earlier in the year, fell yesterday amid concern that oil prices could rise in the event of a military confrontation in the Persian Gulf. Tokyo Electric Power was off 110 at 5600.    Fear of higher interest rates is another major factor pulling share prices down, analysts say.    Yields on long-term Japanese government bonds have been rising recently, as the yen weakened against the dollar and Japanese investors stepped up investment in foreign bonds, especially U.S. Treasury issues. In the past two months, the yield on the bellwether 10-year Japanense goverment bond has risen about two percentage points to about 4.5%, and investors and analysts see higher long-term rates ahead.    Interest rates may go higher because &quot;the government hasn't done anything forceful enough to change the situation,&quot; says Ron Napier, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd.    &quot;Most people feel the opportunity to turn (the situation) around is weak.&quot;    And yesterday some Bank of Japan executives indicated that Japan's central bank may tolerate an increase in the longterm prime lending rate, which stands at 4.9%.    It is only natural that long-term interest rates reflect &quot;realities in the (bond) market,&quot; one executive said.    Meanwhile, money supply increases exceeding 10% make further monetary relaxation unlikely, some economists say. In addition, &quot;the price of oil has a significant influence on the availability&quot; of money, First Boston says in its study, because higher oil prices divert cash from elsewhere in the economy and the marketplace.    In the foreign exchange market, the weakening of the yen against the dollar from 138 in April to the current level of about 152 has prompted investors to take a new look at export-oriented stocks and sell issues that depend on domestic demand. A weaker yen makes an exporter's products less expensive overseas.    During the latest decline, export-led issues generally have bucked the downward trend, although the issues were sold yesterday as investors worried that the U.S. Congress may be able to override President Reagan's threatened veto of recent trade legislation that is viewed as protectionist in Japan.    Electrical and electronics products maker Japan Victor slipped 170 to 3150 yesterday.Matsushita Electric Industrial dropped 130 to 2250. Pioneer Electronics fell 100 to 3030.    Auto maker Honda was down 80 at 1480, and Toyota slipped 40 to 1730.    Meanwhile, even as pension fund managers try to balance the weight of domestic demand issues and blue-chip export stocks in their portfolios, many are also boosting their cash holdings.    &quot;When the market was roaring it was stupid to have cash,&quot; says the fund manager at a major Japanese trust bank. &quot;But now it isn't so bad.&quot; And Salomon's Mr. Napier says, &quot;Everyone is getting into cash right now and waiting.&quot;    Many analysts and brokers predict the Nikkei average will continue to fall, to between 22000 and 22500, before turning upward in late August. One of the reasons the decline isn't expected to last more than several weeks is that the Japanese still have a lot of excess funds to invest.    &quot;The weight of money isn't gone,' says Mitsugu Terada, a senior pension fund manager at Sumitomo Trust andamp; Banking Co. And others point out that share prices are being supported by the Japanese economy, which they predict will remain strong until next year.    However, some of the Japanese cash has been filtering into stocks in the U.S. -- and to a lesser degree, Britain and West Germany. And oil prices and interest rates can be expected to play important roles in the performance of the Japanese economy.    The expected 5 trillion yen ($32.88 billion) issue in October of more Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. shares could do a lot to stimulate the market, Mr. Ozawa at James Capel says.    &quot;The next sale of NTT shares is very important to the government,&quot; he says. In order for the sale to go smoothly and profitably, market sentiment and trading volume must be strong, he says, and &quot;it will take at least a month&quot; to rebuild investors' confidence.    However, liquidity in the market could be a problem. First Boston says in its study that Japanese banks &quot;will issue almost 1.2 trillion yen of stocks and convertible bonds in the second half of this year.&quot; In addition, First Boston says, 48 million government-held JAL shares, totaling 700 billion yen, are expected to be offered in December, bringing the total of major stock and stock-related issues to seven trillion yen.    Liquidity and demand for stocks, First Boston says, &quot;is not as favorable as it was in the first half of the year.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
