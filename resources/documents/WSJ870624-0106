A spokesman for de Havilland said talks broke off with the Canadian Auto Workers union Monday night after the union rejected its latest contract offer. &quot;It's our best and final offer. I would not expect any further talks for the foreseeable future,&quot; the spokesman said. A spokeswoman for the union said no future talks are scheduled.    The striking workers include 3,500 production workers and 600 salaried employees at de Havilland's Downsview, Ontario, plant, which makes Dash 8 commuter aircraft.    The de Havilland spokesman said its latest contract offer included a lump-sum payment of 3,000 Canadian dollars to each of the workers in the first year and an average wage increase &quot;slightly in excess&quot; of 3% in each of the three years of the contract. The union said it rejected the offer because it proposed to change work rules, job transfers and job descriptions.    Boeing, which manufactures airplanes and missiles, acquired de Havilland last year. It said a strike wouldn't affect its other operations. </TEXT></DOC>
