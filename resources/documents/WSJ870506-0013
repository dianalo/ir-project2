In 1986, Black Hills earned $17 million, or $1.80 a share, on revenue of $111.8 million.    Black Hills said it reached agreements with Portland, Ore.-based PacifiCorp., which conducts business as Pacific Power andamp; Light Co., to settle a dispute over the quantity of coal it was required to purchase from Black Hills, an electric utility, coal and truck company.    These agreements also should increase earnings 55 cents a share in 1988 and will have a continued positive effect for the 26-year term of its contract with PacifiCorp., Black Hills said. </TEXT></DOC>
