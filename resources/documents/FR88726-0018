This action is being taken inresponse to amendments to the Resource Conservation And Recovery Act (RCRA)enacted through the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA).In addition, the Agency is promulgating amendments to the existing UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) Regulations as they pertain to hazardous wasteinjection.Today's notice codifies at 40 CFR Part 148, for those hazardous wastesthat are disposed in Class I hazardous waste injection wells, the directlyapplicable sections of Part 268, the Agency's regulatory framework forimplementing the land disposal restrictions (51 <T3>FR</T3> 40572 <T3>et seq.</T3> November 7, 1986).Part 148 also specifies the effective date of the restrictions on injectionof specific hazardous wastes. Today's rule includes effective dates forthe restrictions on injection of solvent wastes and of dioxin-containingwastes. A recent proposal has specified effective dates for ``Californialist'' wastes (as defined by section 3004(d) of RCRA and at 52 <T3>FR</T3> 25760, July 8, 1987) and for certain wastes prohibited undersection 3004(g) of RCRA (53 <T3>FR</T3> 14892 <T3>et seq.</T3>, April 26, 1988). Further proposals will specify effectivedates for the remaining section 3004(g) wastes. Finally, Part 148 definesthe two circumstances under which a waste otherwise prohibited from injectionmay be injected: (1) when the waste has been treated in accordance withthe requirements of Part 268 pursuant to section 3004(m) of RCRA; or (2)when an applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administratorthat there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the injectionzone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous. Under this rule, an applicantmay submit a petition to the Administrator containing the demonstration.An applicant may make a demonstration of ``no migration'' based on either:(1) an absence of fluid movement out of the injection zone; or (2) an activeprocess of waste reduction, transformation, or immobilization within theinjection zone. Upon a successful demonstration, the applicant will begranted an exemption from the prohibition.Today's promulgation also contains changes to 40 CFR Parts 124, 144 and146, the Class I injection well regulations. These amendments apply toowners and operators of all Class I hazardous waste well, including: thoseinjecting wastes not yet subject to a prohibition, those injecting wasteswhich meet the treatment standards promulgated pursuant to andSection; 3004(m)of RCRA, and those whose wastes have been banned and who have receivedan exemption under Part 148. The changes to andSection; 124.10 and andSection;146.13 pertain to all owners and operators of Class I wells.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>New Part 148, is effective July 26, 1988.

Statutory AuthorityThe Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), enacted on November8, 1984, impose substantial new responsibilities on those who handle hazardouswaste.The amendments prohibit the continued land disposal of untreated hazardouswaste beyond specified dates, unless the Administrator determines thatthe prohibition is not required in order to protect human health and theenvironment for as long as the wastes remain hazardous (RCRA sections 3004(d)(1), (e)(1), (f)(2), (g)(5)). Congress established a separate schedulein section 3004(f) for making determinations regarding the disposal ofdioxins and solvents and the list of wastes specified in section 3004(d)(2),termed the California list, in injection wells.Wastes that meet the treatment standards set by EPA under section 3004(m)of RCRA are no longer prohibited and may be land disposed. The statuterequires EPA to set ``levels or methods of treatment, if any, which substantiallydiminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihoodof migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that short-termand long-term threats to human health and the environment are minimized''(RCRA section 3004(m)(1)).Land disposal prohibitions are effective immediately upon promulgationunless the Agency sets another effective date based on the earliest datethat adequate alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity whichis protective of human health and the environment will be available (RCRAsections 3004(h) (1) and (2)). However, these effective date variancesmay not exceed 2 years beyond the otherwise applicable effective date.In addition, two 1-year case-by-case extensions of the effective date maybe granted under certain circumstances (RCRA section 3004(h)(3)).For the purposes of the land disposal restrictions program, the statutespecifically defines land disposal to include, but not be limited to, anyplacement of hazardous waste in a landfill, surface impoundment, wastepile, injection well, land treatment facility, salt dome or salt bed formation,or underground mine or cave (RCRA section 3004(k)). The legislation alsosets forth a series of deadlines for Agency action. For a full explanationof the statutory framework the reader is referred to the preamble for theregulations that EPA has already proposed or promulgated under the statute,particularly 51 <T3>FR </T3>1602 <T3>et seq., </T3>January 14, 1986; 51 <T3>FR </T3>19300 <T3>et seq., </T3>May 28, 1986; 51 <T3>FR </T3>40572 <T3>et seq., </T3>November 7, 1986; 51 <T3>FR </T3>44714, <T3>et seq., </T3>December 11, 1986; 52 <T3>FR </T3>21010 <T3>et seq., </T3>June 4, 1987; 52 <T3>FR </T3>22356 <T3>et seq., </T3>June 11, 1987; 52 <T3>FR </T3>25760 <T3>et seq., </T3>July 8, 1987; 52 <T3>FR </T3>32446 <T3>et seq., </T3>August 27, 1987; 53 <T3>FR </T3>11742 <T3>et seq., </T3>April 8, 1988; 53 <T3>FR </T3>14892 <T3>et seq., </T3>April 26, 1988; and 53 <T3>FR </T3>17578 <T3>et seq., </T3>May 17, 1988. The following discussion describes morespecifically the statutory framework for injection wells.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 3004(f)</ITAG>Section 3004(f)( addresses the disposal by injection of solvents, dioxins,and California list wastes. Specifically, this section requires the Administratorto promulgate rules prohibiting the disposal of such wastes into wellsif it may ``reasonably be determined that such disposal may not be protectiveof human health and the environment for as long as the waste remain hazardous* * * ''. If EPA does not determine those instances where disposal wouldmeet this standard, the injection of these wastes is prohibited under section3004(f)(3). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 3004(g)</ITAG>Section 3004(g) of RCRA applies the same standards and procedures to allmethods of land disposal. It requires the Agency to set a schedule formaking land disposal restriction decisions for all hazardous wastes listedor identified in 40 CFR Part 261 under RCRA section 3001(c) as of November8, 1984, other than the wastes referred to in sections 3004 (d) and (e).EPA submitted this schedule to Congress on May 28, 1986 (51 <T3>FR</T3> 19300 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Section 3004(g)(5) provides that the regulation promulgated by the Administratormust prohibit methods of land disposal except for methods ``which the Administratordetermines will be protective of human health and the environment for aslong as the waste remains hazardous * * * ''.Further, the section provides that, except for wastes which comply withthe standards promulgated pursuant to section 3004(m), a method of landdisposal may not be determined to be protective of human health and theenvironment, ``unless, upon application by an interested person, it hasbeen demonstrated to the Administrator, to a reasonable degree of certainty,that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposalunit or injection zone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous.''RCRA section 3004(g)(6) provides that if EPA fails to take action undersection 3004(g)(5) by the statutory deadlines for any hazardous waste accordingto the schedule, such hazardous waste may be disposed of in landfills orsurface impoundments only if such disposal units are in compliance withthe minimum technological requirements set forth in RCRA section 3004(o)for new facilities. In this situation, placement of such wastes in othertypes of land disposal units (e.g., deep injection wells) would not beprecluded by section 3004(g)(6). See 130, Cong. Rec. S9192 (daily ed.,July 25, 1984). If EPA fails to set treatment standards, grant a petitionor grant a variance under section 3004(h) for any of the scheduled listedwastes by May 8, 1990, then the particular wastes involved will be prohibitedfrom land disposal.The land disposal prohibitions apply to all hazardous wastes identifiedor listed under RCRA section 3001 as of November 8, 1984, the date of enactmentof HSWA. For any hazardous waste identified or listed under RCRA section3001 after November 8, 1984, EPA is required to make land disposal restrictiondeterminations (i.e., establish treatment standards) within 6 months ofthe date of identification or listing (RCRA section 3004(g)(4)). However,the statute does not impose an automatic prohibition on land disposal ifEPA misses a deadline for any newly listed or identified waste.B. Summary of the Land Disposal Restrictions FrameworkThe Agency has promulgated in 40 CFR Part 268 the regulatory frameworkfor implementing the land disposal restrictions. (51 <T3>FR</T3> 40572 <T3>et seq.</T3>, Nov. 7, 1986). Corrections to the November 7, 1986, finalrule were included in a June 4, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice (52 <T3>FR</T3> 21010) to clarify the Agency's approach to regulating restrictedwastes. Some changes to the framework were also made in the July 8, 1987,rulemaking on the California list wastes (52 <T3>FR </T3>25760). Part 148 codifies the sections of Part 268 that aredirectly applicable to injection wells. In addition, today's rule specifieseffective dates for restrictions on certain injected hazardous wastes.Part 148 also provides the standard and procedures by which petitions todispose of an otherwise prohibited waste by injection will be reviewedand exemptions pursuant to these petitions will be granted or denied.Part 148 is similar in approach to Part 268. The Agency believes, however,that it is useful to the regulated community and to the State regulatorsto have requirements regarding injection wells located in the same portionof the Code of Federal Regulations as are other requirements pertainingto these wells. Hazardous waste injection wells are regulated under theauthority of both the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and RCRA. These regulationshave been codified along with other regulations under the SDWA in Parts124, 144, 145, 146 and 147 of the Code of Federal Regulations.We expect that eventually the Part 148 standards will be implemented bythe same State agencies that currently have primacy for the UIC program.The framework which the Agency has promulgated to implement the land disposalrestrictions for surface disposal facilities is as follows: For each wastethat the Agency prohibits from land disposal, the Agency intends to promulgatetreatment standards under Part 268, Subpart D that meet the requirementsof section 3004(m) of RCRA. Once the standards are effective, restrictedwastes may be land disposed of in a RCRA Subtitle C facility (e.g., a UICClass I hazardous waste well) if they meet the treatment standard.Upon the effective dates of the prohibitions, wastes that do not complywith the applicable treatment standards, or are not subject to a nationalcapacity variance, or that do not have a case-by-case extension under andSection;268.5 are prohibited from placement in land disposal units unless an exemptionhas been granted by the Administrator under andSection; 268.6 pursuant toa petition demonstrating that such disposal units will not allow migrationof hazardous constituents for as long as the wastes remain hazardous.For injection wells, EPA has adopted the same treatment standards thathave been promulgated in Part 268 Subpart D for injected wastes, as providedin Part 148 Subpart B. After the effective date of a prohibition in Part148 Subpart B, untreated wastes can only be injected if an exemption hasbeen granted by the Administrator pursuant to a petition under Part 148Subpart C, or, on a case-by-case basis, an extension to the effective datehas been granted according to the procedures outlined in andSection; 268.5.An extension may not exceed one year, and the Administrator may not renewit more than once.C. Effect on State UIC PrimacyThe requirements being promulgated today could affect the status of Stateswith primary enforcement authority for the UIC program. Specifically, aState will have to amend its program to conform with the new regulationsat Parts 124, 144, and 146 by April 24, 1989 (section 1422(b)(1) of theSDWA). Of course, a State which now prohibits Class I wells in generalor injection of hazardous waste would not be required to make such a demonstration,since such a program would be more stringent than either existing or newUIC requirements.The Agency notes that the new requirements will remove the existing ``shield''for hazardous waste well permits. That is, under the previous regulations,permits could not be modified, revoked, or reissued to require compliancewith new regulations unless the permittee requested or agreed. Under today'samendment to Part 144, new regulations would be grounds for initiatingpermit modification. These changes to Parts 124 and 144_unlike the effectof the land disposal restrictions which are immediately effective_willnot take effect in primacy states until EPA approves the modification ofthe State program.The Agency expects that part of a State's demonstration that its programconforms with the amended regulations would be an amendment to the Memorandumof Agreement where the state would agree on a schedule to modify existingpermits, if necessary, to incorporate the new regulations.States need not seek authorization to administer Part 148 to maintain UICprimacy. However, the Agency also expects that State agencies which haveprimacy for the UIC program will wish to implement Part 148, and receiveauthorization to grant exemptions from land disposal restrictions. However,before such authorization can be granted the State would have to demonstratethat it has authorization to implement andSection;andSection;3004 (f), (g),and (h) of RCRA. A thorough discussion of the conditions under which suchauthorization can take place can be found in 50 <T3>FR </T3>28728 <T3>et seq.,</T3> July 15, 1985. In addition, where jurisdiction for UICand RCRA do not reside in the same State Agency, EPA will require a Memorandumof Understanding between the two entities, clearly outlining responsibilityfor granting exemptions.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Summary of Today's Rulemaking: Response to Comments; Part 148</ITAG>A.Proposed Standard for Demonstrating Protection of Human Health and theEnvironmentAs noted in the proposal, sections 3004 (f) and (g) both require a demonstrationthat injection is protective of human health and the environment. Undersection 3004(g) it is clear that such a demonstration must include a showingof ``no migration'' of hazardous constituents from the injection zone foras long as the wastes remains hazardous. EPA believes that the ``no migration''standard of section 3004(g) helps define what is protective of human healthand the environment under section 3004(f). Section 3004(g), by its terms,restricts the injection of certain hazardous wastes into injection wells.In the proposal, EPA noted that the wastes covered under section 3004(f)are just as hazardous to human health and the environment as those undersection 3004(g), and concluded that injection of either set of wastes shouldbe subject to the same standard. Thus, the Agency proposed that the demonstrationshould be similar for all injection wells regardless of the type of injectedwaste and that the ``no migration'' standard should apply to all. For thisreason, the Agency is using a petition process and standard that is thesame for all prohibited hazardous wastes that are injected, whether theyfall under subsection (f) or (g).Several commenters supported this interpretation of the law. Other commentersstated that the ``application and demonstration'' clause of sections 3004(d)(1) and (g)(5) of RCRA would not necessarily require procedures as rigorousor time consuming as EPA's proposed petition process. Moreover, these lattercommenters point out that section 3004(f) simply does not contain the applicationand demonstration clause and could, therefore, differ in procedural approach.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Alternative Procedures for Implementing Sections 3004 (f) and (g)</ITAG>Several commenters suggested an alternative approach whereby the Agencycould make a determination that injection of wastes in accordance withthe substantive standards of andSection;148.20 will be protective of humanhealth and the environment. The Agency could then promulgate rules prohibitinginjection which is not in compliance with these standards. Such action,the commenters maintained, would satisfy the Agency's mandate under sections3004 (f) and (g).EPA believes that RCRA provides significant latitude in the proceduralapproaches to determinations under sections 3004(d), (e), (f), and (g)of RCRA. Under any of these approaches EPA would need to support determinationsunder section 3004(g)(5) that there is ``no migration of hazardous constituentswhile the waste remains hazardous'' with sufficient technical basis, whetherpart or all of that basis is generic to the practice of hazardous wasteinjection. Under section 3004(f), EPA would need to support the findingthat hazardous waste injection is ``protective of human health and theenvironment''. As a matter of policy, and not statutory mandate, EPA isapproaching the standards for injection wells under sections 3004 (f) and(g) identically and is choosing the petition process in this final ruleto make appropriate findings under both sections. The suggested alternativeswhich rely on more generic findings that the method of underground injectionmeets the standard along with facility certifications would not be as reliableas determinations based on site-specific demonstrations. To the extentthat geology varies areally, the difficulty of modeling and characterizingthe geology increases; the degree of uncertainty associated with a demonstrationincreases also.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Generic Petition Demonstrations</ITAG>In the proposal, the Agency requested comment on a number of alternateapproaches for satisfying the requirements of section 3004(f) of RCRA.These approaches were proposed in light of the Agency's ability to process``no migration'' petitions in the period between promulgation of this regulationand the ``hard hammer'' deadline of August 8, 1988, for andSection; 3004(f)wastes. One proposed approach was the submittal of generic petitions. Underthis scenario, operators injecting the same waste into a single formationcould submit one petition seeking an exemption from the ban, provided thatthe sites shared similar regional and basic site-specific geologies. Similarly,it was proposed that a single State could petition for a waiver from theban for injection facilities within that State. These approaches receivedextensive comment, both pro and con. Commenters who disagreed with theseapproaches did so on the basis of what they perceived as petitioners' inabilityto submit information on geologies and waste streams that would be generalenough to describe more than one facility, yet specific enough to insure``no migration'' at every site.The Agency understands this position, and realizes that successful petitionsof this nature will be difficult to develop. This option is certainly withinthe legal parameters of a RCRA ``no migration'' demonstration, however,and as such, it will be a permissible petitioning alternative for the regulatedcommunity. The Agency has no intention of lowering the standards beingpromulgated today in allowing the use of generic petitions. Such petitionswill have to adequately meet all of the regulatory requirements of Part148 that insure protection of human health and the environment.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Scope of the ``No Migration'' Petition Demonstrations</ITAG>Several commenters contended that exemptions granted pursuant to a ``nomigration'' demonstration were intended by Congress to be limited in number.They inferred from the Agency's proposal that a sizable portion of theinjection facilities might pass the demonstration and stated that thissomehow violated the statute.The Agency would like to note that until petitions are received and processed,EPA has no clear idea of the number of demonstrations which might be successful.Some very preliminary worst-case modeling performed by EPA did indicatethat the demonstration was achievable by some. The Agency believes thatCongress was setting a very stringent performance standard, not creatingan arbitrary quota. Moreover, there is evidence that Congress recognizedthat some UIC wells could meet this standard (see S. Rept. 284 98th Cong.1st Sess. at 14 and Cong. Record S. 9153, July 25, 1984). The exact numberor percent of petitions which are deemed successful must be determinedby whether facilities have the hydrogeologic or geochemical characteristicscapable of meeting the standard, not on some predetermined number of siteswhich ought to be allowed to meet the standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Statutory and Regulatory Definition of Injection Zone</ITAG>Several commenters sought to limit the statutory and regulatory term ``injectionzone'' in a manner which, in EPA's view, (1) is not mandated by RCRA orthe SDWA, (2) is not consistent with current regulations, (3) is irrationalfor the purposes of RCRA sections 3004 (f) and (g), and (4) would provideno benefits to environmental protection. At the heart of their argumentis the concept that an injection zone may not contain confining material.Fluid penetration into such material, they would argue, is necessarilymigration from an injection zone. EPA rejects these arguments.The term injection zone under RCRA sections 3004 (f) and (g) and in theUIC program must have a functional meaning as the unit which must containthe waste. Containment can only occur within the relatively less permeableconfining material. The legislative history of the 1984 HSWA amendmentsstates that ``[i]n determining appropriate confinement from which migrationshall not be allowed to occur the terms disposal unit or injection zoneshould be construed . . . in terms of overall integrity of the disposalpractice, keeping in mind, in particular the potential for contaminationof groundwater or surface water resources'' (S. Rept. 284 98th Cong. 1stSess. at 15). Essentially, the UIC program permits the use of certain geologicformations or parts of formations in the inaccessible subterranean environmentfor waste disposal so long as this disposal is sufficiently removed fromgroundwater or surface water resources. There is no provision in the legislativehistory or RCRA sections 3004 (f) and (g) which states or implies thatconfining material is a resource which must not be used for disposal orcannot be part of an injection zone.The legislative history of the 1984 HSWA amendments further indicates thatthe statutory term ``injection zone'' should match the regulatory definitionin 40 CFR 146.3. That provision defines an injection zone as ``a geologicformation, group of formations, or part of a formation receiving fluidsthrough a well''. Clearly under this definition permit writers must usetheir expertise and knowledge of local hydrogeology to determine the sizeand characteristics of injection zones. The current regulations place otherlimitations on permit writers' discretion. First, under 40 CFR 144.3 and146.3, hazardous waste injection must only take place below the lowermostformation containing within one-quarter mile of a well bore an UndergroundSource of Drinking Water (USDW). There must also be a confining zone whichis ``capable of limiting fluid movement above an injection zone'' (40 CFR146.3). The function of a confining zone is to oppose the upward pressuresof injection and prevent fracturing of the geologic system. Nothing inthis definition, however, states that an injection zone may not containconfining material or even that a confining zone may not include part ofan injection zone. Only the functional ability to oppose upward migrationis necessary.Apparently, these commenters believe that there is always a discrete boundarywhere permeable material meets impermeable material and injection fluidwould seemingly bounce off this barrier, with no penetration of the impermeablematerial. However, this notion does not conform with physical reality.First, within a formation or group of formations, there is often not aline where a large permeable strata meets relatively less permeable strata.Geologic formations, such as the ones encountered in the Gulf Coast Basin,for example, are often several hundred feet thick (Refs. 1, 2, and 3).Over such thickness, variations in lithology such as the interfingeringof sands and shales often occur. Accompanying the lithological changesare variations in permeability, porosity, and hydraulic conductivities(Refs. 4, 5, and 6). Second, confining material might not actually repelfluids; they oppose upward movement, and where adequate, stop it. Thus,some amount of penetration into confining material within the injectionzone can occur, but should not be considered migration for the purposesof RCRA sections 3004 (f) and (g), provided the penetration occurs withinthe injection zone.Prior to the 1984 HSWA amendments, permit writers did not fully considerthe extent of fluid penetration of confining material since that penetrationwas always well below the formation containing a USDW. The Agency's proposalmade clear that the injection zone itself must be appropriate to containhazardous fluids. These commenters' statement that this approach is unlawfulis not well founded. Moreover these commenters offer no credible alternative.Accordingly, EPA maintains in this final rule the interpretation outlinedin the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Hazardous Levels at the Unit Boundary </ITAG>In the proposal, a petition under RCRA andSection;andSection;3004 (f) and (g)would satisfy the statutory standard if it showed that before injectedfluid crossed the top of an injection zone or a point of discharge, thefluid was no longer hazardous. In its proposal, EPA suggested using health-basedlimits which have undergone peer review by the Agency and are used in RCRAdelisting decisions and for clean closure demonstrations. In the absenceof such standards, EPA proposed that the Agency require petitioners todemonstrate that concentrations had been reduced to three orders of magnitudebelow detection levels. Although commenters generally expressed support for the use of health-basedvalues to define hazardous levels, some objected to any use of health-basedlevels. These commenters believe that the statutory phrase in RCRA sections3004 (e), (d), and (g) that there be ``no migration of hazardous constituentswhile the waste remains hazardous'' means that EPA may not allow a singlemolecule of a constituent listed in 40 CFR Part 261 Appendix VIII to leavean injection zone. The Agency specifically interprets the statutory phraseas requiring consideration of the fate of Appendix VIII constituents whichare either injected or derived from injected waste. EPA, however, believes that Congress, in the use of the term ``hazardous''and the phrase ``while the waste remains hazardous'', was concerned thatinjected fluid which leaves the injection zone not be hazardous and therebynot contain Appendix VIII constituents at hazardous levels. This interpretation is consistent with the language in the 1984 amendmentswhich expressly direct the Agency to ``tak[e] into account'' the ``persistence,toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate of . . .'' hazardouswastes and their hazardous constituents in making determination with respectto deep well injections. <T3>See </T3>RCRA sections 3004 (f)(2), (g)(5), and (d)(1)(C). To taketoxicity and propensity to bioaccumulate into account the Agency must necessarilyconsider concentration levels. This interpretation is further consistentwith the Senate Report which states that the ``no migration of hazardousconstituents . . .'' for as long as the wastes remain hazardous standardcan be satisfied if the Administrator finds ``that migration of the wasteswill not occur while the wastes still retain their hazardous characteristicsin such a way that [sic] would present any threat to human health and theenvironment.'' (S. Rep. No. 98-284 at 15.) The emphasis on concentration levels, as opposed to single molecules, isdeeply established in EPA's regulations. Ordinarily the term ``hazardousconstituents'' has no regulatory effect unless concentrations are alsoconsidered. Thus, the use of the term ``hazardous constituents'' underEPA's interpretation of RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), and (g) is consistentwith EPA's rules and policies for listing and delisting hazardous wasteas well as cleanup standards. The listing procedures, in effect prior to1984, state clearly that solid waste containing any of the constituentslisted in 40 CFR Part 261 Appendix VIII might be termed hazardous considering,among other factors, the concentrations of the constituents in the waste(40 CFR 261.11). (See also the delisting rule at 40 CFR 260.22; the cleanclosure rule (52 <T3>FR </T3>8704, March 19, 1987); and the groundwater cleanup rules at40 CFR 264.94(a) (2) and (3).) It should be noted that wastes can be rendered nonhazardous in the senseof concentration (see proposal at 52 <T3>FR </T3>32453), but there is no chemical reaction that will completelyeliminate all molecules of some Appendix VIII constituents. Thus a standardbased on single molecules would not reflect the reality of chemical transformations.Moreover, wastes may be rendered nonhazardous by means of chemical transformation,adsorption of heavy metals or some organics, as well as by several othermechanisms. Immobilization of heavy metals in the injection zone is obviouslya desired result. Accordingly, the Agency believes the most logical standardunder RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), (f), and (g) consistent with the environmentalconcern is whether hazardous fluids ever leave the disposal units and notwhether hazardous levels of constituents remain in the unit. Thus, thephrase ``while the waste remains hazardous'' should not reflect wasteswhich stay in the unit. For mobile constituents, the distinction between migrating fluids and fluidsstill in the injection zone would make little difference under the 10,000year containment approach in andSection;148.20 discussed below. After 10,000years of containment constituents would either be immobilized or otherwisebe at nonhazardous levels throughout the injection zone. The stringent reading that no molecules may leave an injection zone isinconsistent with EPA's regulatory approach to what is and is not hazardousfor regulatory concerns. Commenters have not shown that EPA's approachviolates RCRA and have not offered any other credible approach. Accordingly,EPA maintains in this final rule the approach proposed. A few commenters objected to the use of MCLs as health-based limits onthe theory that MCLs factor in elements of cost, and are therefore nottruly health-based limits.The Agency, in a recent rulemaking, determined that MCLs are, in fact,protective of human health (see 52 <T3>FR</T3> 25700-25701, July 8, 1987). Basically, MCLs are conditionedby the feasibility of treatment. As the discussion in the preamble to therule cited above indicates, MCLs have been found to be protective of health,not withstanding consideration of this factor. Several commenters objected to the proposal which would have required thepetitioner to demonstrate that concentrations had been reduced to threeorders of magnitude below detection limits in the absence of establishedhealth-based levels. In objecting, some noted that there was no relationshipbetween our ability to detect a constituent and its potential health effects.Others noted that there is no fixed level which represents the detectionlimit. They contended that the technology used to detect constituents israpidly evolving, and varies from lab to lab. Finally, some maintainedthat three orders of magnitude below detection levels was excessively stringentand would establish levels far below any which might arise from known health-basedlevels. Many of these commenters suggested that the petitioner identifylevels of concern in the absence of established limits and demonstrateto the Agency that the limits selected are protective. The Agency, after consideration, remains convinced that there must be asurrogate for health-based limits in cases where no such limits have beenor can be expeditiously established. Further, EPA believes that detectionlimits form an appropriate basis for this surrogate. However, EPA agreesthat three orders of magnitude may be excessive. Only in very rare casesdoes a waste pose a health threat at such low levels. The Agency consideredthe option of having the petitioner demonstrate a level which would nothave a potential to threaten health, but rejected it. While we are notallowing petitioners to define health-based levels, we will use data suppliedby them to allow the Agency to specify a level of concern. Several mechanismsexist which allow the Agency to formulate interim levels of concern ona very rapid basis where data exists, and the Agency would use these whenmore formal levels had not been established. Only in cases where very littledata exists would EPA rely on a surrogate. The final approach being specified today uses detection limits as the appropriatelevel when no health-based limit exists or can be developed expeditiouslyby the Agency. This is generally consistent with the approach for listing,delisting, and clean closure described above. Three orders of magnitudebelow detection might cause inconsistent results since sampling of injectedfluid in the injection zone would not even pick up constituents below detectionlevels. B. Applicability_Section 148.1 As proposed, andSection; 148.1 identifies the regulated community and broadlyindicates the situations under which a facility may receive a variance,exemption, or extension from the RCRA Land Ban. One commenter believedthat there should be no withdrawal required for wastes injected prior tofinal EPA approval or denial of actual petitions. The commenter was respondingto the statement in the proposal that ``the Agency has determined thatthe restrictions limit the injection of wastes after the restriction deadlines,but do not apply to wastes injected prior to the applicable dates.'' (52FR 32449) The commenter is in part correct. The prohibitions do not apply retroactively,and therefore wastes injected prior to the effective date do not have tobe withdrawn. However, the commenter's contention that the effective dateof the restriction is keyed to the time of the Agency's decision on a petition,is incorrect. The effective dates for a given waste are those specifiedby the statute in section 3004(f) or promulgated pursuant to section 3004(g).Thus, waste withdrawn from the formation after the effective date of anapplicable ban is subject to the requirements of RCRA section 3004 exceptin the case where withdrawal is soil or debris resulting from a cleanupactivity under CERCLA or RCRA, in which case the waste is not subject tothe ``land ban'' provisions until November of 1988 (see section 3004(e)(3)).There may be situations (e.g., salt domes) where an injection technologyis not identical to the technology addressed in this rulemaking. In suchcases, EPA will accept petitions under the statutory standards and applythe technical standards from Part 148 which are relevant and appropriate,along with other standards necessary to meet the statutory requirementsof sections 3004 (f) and (g).C. Definitions_Section 148.2In the proposal the Agency defined two new terms at andSection; 148.2: ``injectioninterval'' and ``transmissive fault or fracture''. Some commenters believedthat the new definitions were both warranted and adequately explicit. Othersfelt the new terms were warranted, but indicated that some needed furtherclarification or modification. Still others felt that the Agency neededto define additional terms or redefine already established terms in additionto those proposed on August 27.Most of the comments received pertained to injection interval. Some organizationsfelt that this new definition led to a liberal interpretation of the injectionzone, and presumably a less protective injection scenario. Others feltthat the well screen itself could be defined as the injection intervalunder this definition, thereby creating an artificially small receivingformation. The Agency believes that the injection interval is a necessarydelineation in light of the andSection; 148.20 ``no migration'' demonstration.An essential part of the andSection; 148.20 modeling requirements is themodeled distance the waste travels within the injection zone. This distancemust be measured from a defineable point or area that is distinguishedas that place in the injection zone in which the well is screened, or inwhich the waste is otherwise directly emplaced. That defineable point orarea is the injection interval, and EPA today promulgates that definitionas proposed.The term ``transmissive fault or fracture'' received only positive comments,and is today promulgated as proposed.Various commenters suggested the adoption of new or redefined terms. TheAgency considered these suggestions and believes that, with the inclusionof today's two new definitions and those promulgated in Part 146, all termsrequired to define and regulate injection of hazardous wastes have beenpromulgated.D. Dilution Prohibition_Section 148.3In the proposal, the Agency adopted the prohibition on dilution by referenceto andSection; 268.3. This section prohibits dilution of restricted wastesas a substitute for treatment to achieve compliance with either a treatmentstandard or, in the case of the California List, to bring the waste belowthe applicable restriction level. The Agency received comments supportingthis approach. Two commenters, however, requested clarification on thepoint at which dilution would be established, with one suggesting the inclusionof preamble language from the July 8, 1987 (52 <T3>FR</T3> 25778) final rule which amended the Land Ban framework. Thebasis of the andSection; 268.3 regulation was outlined in that final ruleand applies to both injection wells and surface facilities. We are adoptingthe approach in that preamble.Legitimate aggregation of waste streams to facilitate centralized treatmentis not considered impermissible dilution. However, artificial aggregationof wastes to avoid a land disposal prohibition standard, or mixing substancesthat do not either themselves need to be treated or which do not aid intreatment, would be considered impermissible. Thus, andSection; 148.3 isintended to prohibit dilution as a means of circumventing the requirementsimposed by the land disposal prohibitions. The Agency does not intend toprohibit dilution which is necessary to facilitate treatment.E. Case-by-Case Extensions_Section 148.4In the proposal, the Agency incorporated by reference andSection; 268.5 asandSection; 148.4. Section 148.4 will permit the owner or operator of a hazasrdouswaste injection well to submit an application to the Administrator demonstratingthat a binding contract has been enetered into to construct or otherwiseprovide alternative capacity that cannot reasonably be made available bythe applicable effective date due to circumstances beyond that applicant'scontrol. Two commenters felt that such an extension should be applicableto owners or operators who have submitted ``no migration'' petitions andare waiting approval.Variances, extensions, and exemptions from the UIC Land Ban exist in fiveforms: (1) an exemption as a result of a successful ``no migration'' petitionpursuant to the requirements of Subpart C of Part 148; (2) a statutoryexemption until November 8, 1988, if the waste has been determined to becontaminated soil or debris resulting from a response action taken undersection 104 or 106 of CERCLA or a corrective action required under RCRA;(3) a variance if the wastes cannot be treated to the level (or by themethod) specified by the treatment standard established in section 268,pursuant to andSection; 268.44; (4) a variance granted for lack of alternativecapacity pursuant to section 3004(h)(2) or RCRA; and (5) a case-by-caseextension pursuant to section 3004(h)(3). Unlike the variances and extensionsnoted above, there is no statutory authority to allow for a case-by-caseextension of the ban date for owners or operators who have submitted ``nomigration'' petitions and are awaiting approval. In the case of a treatmentfacility under construction, an applicant can assure with some confidencethat at some time treatment will be available. No such assurance can bemade on the outcome of a petition; it may be approved or denied.The Agency believes, moreover, that it was Congress' intent, when settingthe so-called ``hard hammer'', to move the Agency and industry towardsa swift and effective national hazardous waste management program thatis protective of human health and the environment. Reviewing and actingon ``no migration'' petitions in a timely fashion is part of this program.As a practical matter, the promulgated and proposed treatment capacityvariances should in most cases provide the Agency time to process the ``nomigration'' petitions before the regulatory hammer falls; the Agency'sinability to process a petition is not and cannot be the basis of an extensiongranted under section 3004(h)(3), however.Another commenter supported the adoption of the case-by-case provision,but believed that it should be interpreted to include extensions for facilitieswhich have contracted for raw materials that will render their final productnon-hazardous, but which are currently unavailable. Although other factorsmust be considered (see andSection; 268.5), the Agency believes that thisis an appropriate interpretation of the statute, to the extent that theaddition of such raw materials constitutes alternative treatment or recovery,since section 3004(h)(3) allows the Administrator to grant such an extensionfor the purpose of constructing <T3>or otherwise </T3>providing such alternative capacity. F. Waste Specific Prohibitions_Sections 148.10 and 148.11<ITAG tagnum="81">1. F001 through F005 Solvent Wastes</ITAG>Section 148.10 sets effective dates for the restriction of injected solventwastes. In addition, this section outlines the situations under which sucheffective dates do not apply. Comments were received on various provisionsand standards adopted or proposed at this section.Many organizations commented on the Agency's adoption of andSection; 268.41treatment standards for injected solvents. Under the authority of section3004(m) of RCRA, the Agency identified in the November 7, 1986, rule, treatmentstandards applicable to the following spent solvent wastes (including solventmixtures) F001, F002, F003, F004, and F005 based on the levels of treatmentthat could be achieved by Best Demonstrated Available Technologies (BDAT)for these solvents (51 <T3>FR </T3>40573 <T3>et seq.</T3>):<ITAG tagnum="15">Acetone</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">n-Butyl alcohol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Carbon disulfide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Carbon tetrachloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlorobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cresols (and cresylic acid)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cyclohexanone</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1, 2-Dichlorobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ethyl Acetate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ethylbenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ethyl ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Isobutanol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Methanol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Methylene chloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Methylene chloride (from the pharmaceutical industry)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Methyl ethyl ketone</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Methyl isobutyl ketone</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Nitrobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Pyridine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Tetrachloroethylene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Toluene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1, 1, 1-Trichloroethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1, 1, 2-Trichloro-1, 1, 2-trifluoroethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Trichloroethylene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Trichlorofluoromethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Xylene.</ITAG>The Agency proposed applying those treatment standards for solvent wastesthat are currently injected. Some commenters felt that the BDAT establishedin andSection; 268.41 is inappropriate for the large-volume, low-grade wastesbring injected. Others supported the adoption. According to the best dataavailable to the Agency at this time, solvent wastes that are surface disposeddiffer from those that are deep-well injected only by amount, not by type.Accordingly, the Agency is today adopting the standards in andSection; 268.41as BDAT for injected solvent wastes.The Agency has recently completed the National Survey of Hazardous WasteTreatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey)(Ref. 7). This comprehensive database consists of the best informationavailable to the Agency at this time. The TSDR Survey indicates that approximately40 million gallons of low concentration (less than one percent), surfacedisposed sovlent wastes will require some form of alternative treatment.The TSDR Survey also shows approximately 317 million gallons of deep wellinjected solvent wastes. The Agency is attempting to determine the concentrationof these injected solvents, but current information shows at least 260million gallons to be below 1%. The appropriate treatment for these dilutesolvents is wastewater treatment (steam stripping, carbon adsorption, biologicaltreatment and wet air oxidation) followed by solidification/stabilizationand combustion. The TSDR Survey indicates that only 75 million gallonsof such capacity exists. In addition, and as noted in the proposal, the Agency expects that wastesresulting from both corrective action activities mandated by section 3004(u)of RCRA, and CERCLA removal and remedial actions, will place substantiallyincreased demands on available treatment capacity. Preliminary studiesindiate that approximately 2.8 to 5.6 <T3>billion </T3>gallons of ground water containing solvents may be extractedfrom such sites between 1988 and 1990 (Ref. 8). Again, the concentrationsof these wastes have not been determined; the Agency expects the additionalquantity of wastes resulting from these actions to occupy any increasedtreatment capacity that might become available as facilities meet the minimumtechnology requirements of section 3004(o) of RCRA, as well as tank orother on-site capacity which might be developed over the next few years.Based on these data, EPA is promulgating the variance proposed on August27, granting a two-year national variance for injected spent solvent wastescontaining less than one percent total F001-F005 solvent constituents atthe point of initial generation (i.e., when the wastes first meet the listingdescription) which are disposed of by injection in Class I wells. Today'srule does not establish effective dates for the commercial chemical products,manufacturing chemical intermediates, and off-specification commercialchemical products (P and U wastes) listed at andSection; 261.33 that correspondto the F001-F005 spent solvent wastes. These wastes will be addressed ina later rule. This rule also does not cover the four newly listed solventsin the F001-F005 listing which were added after the date of enactment ofthe 1984 amendments to RCRA: benzene, 2-ethoxyethanol, 2-nitropropane,and 1, 1, 2-trichloroethane (51 <T3>FR </T3>6538). The Agency is currently gathering data to characterizeand evaluate these wastes.One commenter indicated that wastes which naturally meet treatment standardsshould not require treatment, nor be banned. This was explicitly proposedat andSection;148.10(c)(1) and andSection;148.11(b)(1), and remains a partof today's promulgation.One commenter noted that the Agency had failed to include in the prohibitionsat andSection;148.10 the provision for wastes receiving a variance from thetreatment standard obtained under 40 CFR 268.44. Section 268.44 was promulgatedon November 7, 1986. It applies to situations where a particular wastestream cannot be treated to the level (or by the method) specified as thetreatment standard. The Agency envisions that wastes may be subject toa treatability variance in cases where the treatment standard for a particularstream cannot be met because the waste differs significantly from the typeof wastes EPA considered when establishing treatment standards. A particularwaste may be significantly different from the wastes considered in establishingtreatability groups, for example, if the waste contains a more complexmatrix which makes it more difficult to treat. For instance, complex mixturesmay be formed when a restricted waste is mixed with other waste streamsby spills or other forms of inadvertent mixing. As a result, the treatabilityof the restricted waste may be altered such that it cannot meet the applicabletreatment standard. In such a case, generators or owners/operators maypetition the Agency for an alternative treatment standard. While the Agencydoes not presently have any information indicating that promulgated treatmentstandards are not applicable to injected hazardous wastes, it is conceivablethat such a situation may arise. Consequently the Agency is adding languageto andSection;148.10 that adopts a procedure to evaluate petitions for avariance from the treatment standard as promulgated at andSection;268.44.At this time, EPA has limited information indicating concentrations forthe remaining solvent-containing wastes which are injected. Therefore,the Agency may reexamine whether a variance for these wastes is warrantedwhen more data becomes available. At this time, however, the Agency issetting an effective date of August 8, 1988, for the restrictions on F001-F005wastes in concentrations equal to or greater than 1% at the point of initialgeneration (i.e., when the wastes first meet the listing description).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Dioxins</ITAG>Many of the comments on andSection;148.11, the section setting an effectivedate for the restriction of underground injection of dioxins, mirror thosereceived on andSection;148.10. Several commenters did not believe that andSection;268.41treatment standards were applicable, while others supported the proposedsection. The Agency identified in the November 7, 1986, rule, treatmentstandards applicable to dioxin wastes identified by the hazardous wastecodes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, F027, and F028. The Agency has granteda two-year variance to the effective date of the restrictions for thesewastes which are surface disposed, based on lack of capacity. Utilizingthe same rationale as explained above for andSection;148.10, the Agency isadopting andSection;268.41 treatment standards for injected dioxin-containingwastes. Current data available to the Agency show that no dioxin-containingwastes are presently being injected. Restricting the injection of thesewastes would have a negligible effect on availability of treatment capacity.Therefore, as proposed, EPA is not granting a national variance to theeffective date of the ban for injection of these wastes. The effectivedate of the restrictions is August 8, 1988. The andSection;268.44 alternativetreatment variance is being adopted for dioxin wastes as it was for solventsat andSection;148.10.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Other Proposed Prohibitions</ITAG>Many commenters, in addition to supporting variances for both solventsand dioxins, also supported variances for injected ``California list''wastes (as defined in RCRA section 3004(d) and the July 8, 1987, rule (52<T3>FR</T3> 25760)) as well as wastes classified under section 3004(g)of RCRA. The April 26, 1988, notice (53 <T3>FR</T3> 14892 <T3>et seq.</T3>) contained effective dates for the California list wastesand a portion of the section 3004(g) wastes. Further notices will proposeeffective dates for the remaining section 3004(g) wastes.G. Petition Standards_Section 148.20This section outlined the specific standards the Agency proposed to applyto petition demonstrations. In summary, EPA proposed that the demonstrationcould be made on the basis of either waste transformation or fluid flow.Either demonstration would rely on the use of models as well as Agency-recommendedhealth-based limits to define concentrations of waste constituents whichwould be considered hazardous. These levels, which have undergone peerreview by the Agency, are used in delisting decisions and for clean closuredemonstrations (See 52 <T3>FR</T3> 8704, March 19, 1987).The Agency proposed that a demonstration based on fluid flow would haveto show that the waste did not reach a point of discharge for a periodof 10,000 years. In addition, EPA maintained that molecular diffusion wasnot a significant source of solute transport and therefore proposed thatdiffusion not be considered as part of a demonstration. A successful showingwould also have required the petitioner to comply with certain amendedprovisions of Part 146. As an additional safeguard, a petitioner wouldhave to show that the confining zone was four times thicker than the verticaldistance which the waste was expected to move in the injection zone, andthat the injection zone was separated from the lowermost USDW by ten timesthat distance.The Agency received extensive comment on this framework. In general, commenterswere supportive of much of the proposal and indicated that it was consistentwith statutory standards in sections 3004(f) and (g). A summary of thecomments, the Agency's responses, and the final approach for each of theserequirements follows.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Basing Determinations on 10,000 Years</ITAG>The proposal specified that when modeling flow, the petitioner demonstratethat the waste would not reach a point of discharge, either verticallyor horizontally, for a period of 10,000 years. As noted in the proposal,the Agency specified the 10,000 year time frame not because migration afterthat time was of no concern, but because it believed a site which couldmeet a 10,000 year time period would both provide containment for a substantiallylonger time frame, and allow time for geochemical transformations whichwould render the waste nonhazardous or immobile (Refs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,14, and 15).There was considerable comment on this provision. Some believed the timeperiod to be far too long. Their suggested alternatives ranged from 100to 1000 years. In support of these shorter time frames, these commenterspointed to language in House Report No. 198 (Pt. 1, 98th Cong., 1st Sess.at 33) which talks in terms of hundreds of years. Several also suggestedthat it is difficult to model accurately over such long time periods.Others indicated that a 10,000 year time frame did not provide the ``reasonabledegree of certainty'' required by the statute that hazardous waste wouldnot migrate out of the injection zone.The Agency has reviewed these comments and after careful considerationbelieves the 10,000 year demonstration stikes an appropriate balance betweenthe need to demonstrate ``no migration'' with a reasonable degree of certaintyand the limits of the technological means of making that demonstration.It should be noted, that EPA's standard does not imply that leakage willoccur at some time after 10,000 years; rather, it is a showing that leakagewill not occur in that time frame. As noted in the proposal, there is aconsiderable body of evidence suggesting that waste will either degradeto nonhazardous constituents or otherwise be attenuated well within a 10,000year time frame.One commenter cited one of the documents referenced in the proposal andnoted that while organonitriles and nitrate were converted to CO<T2>2</T2> and N<T2>2</T2>, sodium thiocyanate showed relatively less reduction in concentration(Ref. 14). The commenter concluded that this somehow invalidated EPA'sselection of 10,000 years for the term of a demonstration. In this study,residence time of the waste in the injection zone was less than 70 <T3>hours.</T3> While observation of waste degradation in such a shorttime does affirm that waste will degrade in very long time frames, lackof total destruction in hours says nothing about the fate of waste in 10,000years. Thus, EPA rejects the notion that the proposed standard is ``* ** refuted by our own cited references.''Concerning those commenters who questioned the accuracy of modeling overa 10,000 year time frame, the EPA would like to note that many of thesesame commenters had correctly pointed out elsewhere in their comments thatmodeling need not locate the exact point where the waste would be at thattime; determining where it would not be is sufficient. This level of precisionis achievable.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Molecular Diffusion</ITAG>In the proposal, the Agency suggested that movement of contaminants bymolecular diffusion would not result in migration of hazardous constituentsoutside the injection zone at hazardous levels. As a result, EPA proposedthat the petitioner need not consider diffusion in the demonstration requiredin andSection; 148.20.The Agency received extensive comment on this approach, with some expressingstrong support, and others objecting to it. Some commenters offered technicalinformation supporting the Agency's proposed approach. Of particular interestto all commenters was a study conducted by EPA (Ref. 16). Several commentersdid not appear to understand that this study represented an extreme worstcase anaylsis designed to determine the absolute upward limits of movementat hypothetical sites which could occur as a result of diffusion. Othersnoted the coefficients used were more representative of coarse sedimentsthan those found in strata capable of confining fluids. One commenter statedthat modeling movement due to diffusion was straightforward, and that sharplydefined upward limits could be easily and accurately identified. As a result,this commenter contended that movement due to diffusion should not be subjectto any additional safeguards if it is considered in a demonstration.The Agency has reviewed the comments submitted, the new data provided,and refined its own analysis, and remains convinced that in most casesdiffusion does not represent a significant source of solute transport thatwould result in vertical movement of hazardous levels of constituents (Ref.17). However, the Agency does believe that this might not be true in allcases; thus, the determination of whether diffusion is a significant sourceof movement must be made on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, EPA, inthis rule, will require that any movement due to diffusion be accountedfor in the demonstration. The Agency notes that diffusion is accountedfor in most models used to simulate flow in deep, mineralized systems.Consequently, we do not believe there is any significant burden associatedwith requiring consideration of diffusion.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Use of Models</ITAG>The proposed framework was based on predictions of waste location and fateover the very long term, and as such relied on modeling flow or waste degradationor attenuation. Commenters were generally supportive of this approach,but several expressed concern over the accuracy of modeling over time framesof up to 10,000 years. The concerns over modeling for very long time periodshave already been discussed. Moreover, the issue of defining an appropriatemaximum time frame for modeling has been addressed by the Science AdvisoryBoard (SAB) and they endorsed periods up to 10,000 years (Ref. 18).Some commenters, however, objected strenuously to the use of models indemonstrations and contended that there was neither a sound technical basisnor the legal authority to do so.The Agency disagrees with both of these propositions. Nothing in sections3004 (f) or (g) of RCRA or the legislative history forbids the use of modelsto form the basis for a ``no migration'' petition. The final approach reliesupon conservative modeling techniques to evaluate the potential for migrationof hazardous constituents from the injection zone. Fluid flow modelingis a well-developed and mature science and has been used for many yearsin the petroleum industry. More recently, fluid flow models have been furtherdeveloped for the Department of Energy nuclear waste isolation program.Specifically, a wide range of models exists that provide the capabilityto analyze pressure build up, lateral waste migration, vertical fluid permeationinto overlying confining material, and leakage through defects in overlyingaquitards (Refs. 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23). Models make it possible topredict tendencies or trends of events that have not yet occurred or thatmay not be directly observable. Under the ``no migration'' standard, ademonstration need not show exactly what will occur, but rather what conditionswill not occur. Conservative modeling can be used to ``bound the problem''and can legitimately form the basis for the petition demonstrations.Specific hydrogeologic data and operational data are necessary to makea demonstration, and EPA will carefully analyze modeling assumptions. Wheresome uncertainty exists about the data, the demonstrator may conduct sensitivityanalyses to determine the range of error this uncertainty could introduceinto a demonstration.There will be, moreover, an opportunity for public comment on the appropriatenessof the simulator selected, the data used, and the assumptions made in anydemonstration.Finally, the commenters who are contesting, as a general matter, the validityof modeling have offered no technical basis for their objections, nor havethey provided specific suggestions to improve the data or analytic approaches.General statements such as these do not provide useful or credible alternativesfor EPA to implement sections 3004 (f) or (g). Therefore, since (1) nothinglegally prohibits the use of models, (2) appropriate modeling has a soundtechnical basis, and (3) commenters have offered no indication that thereare any specific pitfalls to this approach, EPA does not in this finalrule prohibit the use of modeling to form the basis of a petition demonstrationfor underground injection wells.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Use of a Safety Factor</ITAG>In the proposal, the Agency stated that demonstrations would be based onmodeling and that direct verification of the absence of migration wouldbe problematic due to the difficulty of effectively monitoring the locationof a fluid front at depths ranging from 1500 to 5000 or more feet. In addition,during the regulatory negotiations which helped in the formation of theproposal for this rule, some representatives wanted to limit the permitwriters' discretion by requiring that injection zones have vertical limitations.To deal with these concerns, EPA proposed that the confining zone be fourtimes thicker than the total vertical distance that fluid was expectedto move within the injection zone and that the injection zone be separatedfrom the lowermost USDW by ten times that calculated distance (4x/10x).As noted in the proposal, a further purpose of this provision was to dealwith the uncertainties which some members of the regulatory negotiationcommittee felt were inherent in demonstrations based on modeling. In addition,this provision was seen as providing some additional protection againstthe likelihood that permeable faults or fractures might transect the confiningzone.The Agency received extensive comment on this requirement. Most statedthat they believed the requirement to be excessive and unnecessary, andsome believed it to be arbitrary. Several commenters noted that EPA hadintentionally rejected the use of rigid numerical standards elsewhere inthe proposal, noting that qualitative considerations were often importantin making decisions regarding siting (52 <T3>FR</T3> 32458) and waste migration. One commenter objected to the proposal,but suggested it could be workable if an alternative to the ``4x/10x''requirement was available.A few expressed limited support for the concept, but indicated that ifthe Agency were to restrict the definition of injection zone, such a provisionwould be unnecessary.One commenter wanted to reinstate a ``containment zone,'' which is a conceptintroduced during the regulatory negotiation.Finally, some requested clarification of how this distance should be measured.Commenters suggested that if the Agency were to adopt this approach, theappropriate point of measurement should not be the screened interval, butsome larger area which is defined by the geology of the site.After careful consideration, the Agency has determined that the requirementis unnecessary and may not be appropriate for several reasons. One of thekey difficulties in implementing a ``4x/10x'' provision is the lack ofproportionality between the initial fluid penetration into confining materialand the additional safety provided by a multiple of that initial penetration.There is not necessarily a relationship between the quality of confiningmaterial in the injection zone and material some distance above. Thus,the requirement of further distance proportional to ``x'' is somewhat arbitrary.Moreover, as mentioned above on the discussion of injection zones, theremay be no discrete line to begin the measurement of ``x'' because of theinterfingering of permeable and relatively less permeable material. Tryingto determine with any consistency a point beyond the area of active emplacementinto permeable material would be extremely difficult. This approach wouldalso tend to encourage placement of well perforations nearer to confiningmaterial, which is not necessarily a desirable result in most geologicsettings.Further, the Agency's own analysis has shown that the ``4x/10x'' provisionmay not always afford the level of protection EPA was seeking. For example,modeling has shown that the ``x'' value may be quite small, in some geologicsettings yielding values less than 10 feet (Ref. 15). Such low figureswould not, under most circumstances, provide protection against transmissivefaults or fractures.Second, the Agency believes that any uncertainties resulting from the qualityor extent of geologic data available are better addressed by assuring thatconservative values are used, and that sensitivity analyses are conductedwhere appropriate, to enable the reviewer to assess the amount of variationin performance which might result from a given assumption.Third, with regard to uncertainties associated with verification, the Agencywould like to note that monitoring of pressure decay rates when the wellis shut-in, provide effective means of determining whether the waste isbehaving as a model predicted it would (Ref. 22).Fourth, the Agency rejects the contention that modeling inherently introducesuncertainty into the demonstration; modeling has been used extensivelyin oil field exploration and enhancement with very good results (Ref. 23).Such applications involve the analysis of multiple points of injectionand withdrawal and often involve two-phase flow_an application of considerablygreater complexity than that required for ``no migration'' petitions submittedpursuant to andSection; 148.20. Moreover, within the last few years, fluidflow models have been further developed for the Department of Energy nuclearwaste isolation program (Refs. 24 and 25). Beyond this, EPA would liketo note that models need not identify the precise point to which a plumemay move. Rather, the model can be used to bound the problem, showing apoint to which the plume cannot move. Finally, the Agency would like to point out that requirements currentlyin place and others being promulgated today in andSection; 146.62 in SubpartG apply substantial safeguards to siting of injection wells. To the extentthat such requirements apply to areas outside the injection zone, and addressendangerment of USDWs and not prevention of migration, EPA believes thatPart 146 is the appropriate regulation in which to promulgate these rules.Nevertheless, the requirements still serve to limit the regulatory agency'sdiscretion, and provide additional safeguards addressing the concerns whichthe ``4x/10x'' requirement sought to address. As a practical matter, the Agency believes that the petition reviewer willbe sufficiently constrained by requirements in andSection; 148.21 as it isbeing promulgated today. The final rule specifies more clearly that assumptionsmust be reasonably conservative, and that sensitivity analyses must accommodateany significant uncertainty in the geologic characterization or other aspectsof the demonstration. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Requiring Compliance With Certain Part 146 Requirements</ITAG>The Agency proposed that as part of the petition demonstration, the applicantcertify compliance with the proposed Area of Review (AOR) and CorrectiveAction requirements from Part 146, as well as submit the results of a pressuretest and a radioactive tracer survey (RTS) conducted within six monthsprior to a petition submission. Commenters were generally supportive of the proposed approach, althoughsome requested clarification on whether the UIC permit needed to be revised.Several commenters suggested that EPA's proposal to require that a wellpass a mechanical integrity test within 6 months prior to petition submittalwas too restrictive. They argued that such tests were unnecessary becausethey are currently required in the UIC permits, the six-month time periodwas counter-productive and could discourage submission of petitions ina timely manner, or that other tests could adequately serve to make therequested demonstration. Finally, some commenters contended that all orsome expanded set of the amended UIC requirements should be met as a prerequisiteto petitioning. <T3>a. </T3><T3>Permit Modification.</T3> The Agency did not envision requiring UICpermits to be modified as part of complying with amended Area of Review,Corrective Action or mechanical integrity requirements. It was the Agency'sintent that the operator <T3>certify </T3>compliance with AOR and Corrective Action requirements,and that the operator submit results of a recent pressure test and RTStest. This is the approach being promulgated today in the final rule. <T3>b. Timing of Mechanical Integrity Tests. </T3>EPA agrees that requiringoperators to conduct a pressure and RTS test within 6 months prior to submittinga petition is too restrictive. As noted by some commenters, this requirementcould have the effect of discouraging submission of petitions in a timelymanner. The Agency's primary concern was that the well have a recent demonstrationof integrity prior to approving or denying a petition. Since EPA can envisioncircumstances in which petition reviews may take considerably longer than6 months, the final rule requires the owner or operator to submit the resultsof a pressure test and a RTS test with a petition. The tests must be conductedwithin one year prior to submittal of a petition. If the petition has notbeen approved or denied within one year after the MIT test was performed,the Director may require the owner or operator to perform another and submitthe results. <T3>c. Requiring Compliance with Other Part 146 Standards. </T3>One commentersuggested that at a minimum, the siting provisions in andSection;146.62 shouldbe an integral part of the petition demonstration. Other commenters suggestedthat the Agency require compliance with all the provisions of proposedrequirements in Subpart G of Part 146 prior to approving a petition. First, the Agency would like to note that the siting requirements of andSection;146.62with regards to injected waste are either subsumed in the standard setin andSection;148.20 or are rendered unnecessary by a successful demonstration.Moreover, the andSection;148.20 requirements are more stringent than theandSection;146.62 requirements. By definition, compliance with andSection;148.20 would demonstrate ``no migration'' whereas compliance with andSection;146.62would demonstrate no endangerment, a considerably lesser requirement withregards to hazardous waste. Thus, imposing the requirements in andSection;146.62as part of a petition demonstration would, at best, be redundant. The Agencybelieves the Part 146 requirements are necessary to effectively regulatehazardous waste injection which has not been banned and is therefore notsubject to Part 148 requirements, and to assure that USDWs are not endangeredfrom formation fluids. Second, the 1984 HSWA amendments do not require a general overhaul of existingtechnical UIC regulations for hazardous waste injection and EPA does notbelieve there is an acute need for amendments to these regulations. Thenormal process of program review and the regulatory negotiation processdid lead to the development of several useful proposals for clarifying,updating, or expanding existing regulatory requirements. Many of thesestandards are currently part of the UIC regulatory structure but are simplynot stated in descriptive detail. EPA believes that adherence to currentEPA technical permitting standards along with the new area of review andmechanical integrity requirements provides operational integrity of thedelivery system to a reasonable degree of certainty. The Agency's additionalfindings under the petition process will fully satisfy the statutory standardsunder RCRA sections 3004 (f) and (g). The commenter's proposal that new Part 146 standards must be in place beforepetition approval, is unworkable and unnecessary. Because sections 3004(f) and (g) are HSWA requirements, that approach would essentially requireEPA to run an entirely new UIC permitting scheme on top of those run byUIC primacy states. The petition review and permitting process are notidentical under the statutes. This dual and redundant permitting and enforcementscheme would run until UIC primacy states had obtained HSWA authorizationand would essentially require federal repermitting of every UIC facility.EPA does not believe Congress, in RCRA sections 3004 (f) and (g), mandatedor envisioned such a sweeping and disruptive approach in permitting. Whilethe Agency obviously favors today's revisions to the permitting program,and may in the future seek further changes, it does not believe such changesare intrinsically linked to decisions under RCRA sections 3004 (f) and(g). Moreover, commenters have not shown that any particular aspect ofthe UIC regulations are so critically inadequate that adherence to themin lieu of the new standards would necessarily fail the statutory mandatesof RCRA. H. Information To Be Submitted in Support of Petitions_Section 148.21 Section 148.21 of the proposal specified criteria which the informationsubmitted in support of a petition must meet. In addition, andSection;andSection;148.21(b) and (c) listed certain site-specific information that should be partof a petition. A few commenters noted that no single modeling method orproprietary model should be required for all submitting sites. The Agencyagrees with this position, and believes the proposed language at andSection;148.21(a)(3)allows flexibility in the choice of models, provided that the model hasbeen validated, verified, and calibrated to assure that it is suited tothe site to which it is applied. Some commenters felt that the requirement for a sensitivity analysis inandSection;148.21(a)(6) was not clearly stated. The Agency's intent in proposingthis section was to require the petitioner to: (1) Identify areas wherethe geologic characterization (or other phenomena) contained significantuncertainty; (2) determine a likely range over which values might vary;and (3) perform sensitivity analyses which would determine the magnitudeof the fluctuations in performance which might result from these variations.The Agency agrees with those commenters who believed the rule was unclearand is promulgating more specific language in this section. One commenter requested the inclusion of justification in andSection;148.21(a)(5)for the use of reasonably conservative values whenever values taken fromthe literature or estimated on the basis of known information are usedinstead of site-specific measurements. The commenter apparently believedthat data from the literature is not always inferior to site-specific data.For example, in areas of extensive drilling and extensive, homogeneoussedimentation, data from off-site may provide a high degree of certaintyin the characterization of local geology. The Agency agrees that informationfrom the literature can provide certitude. Section 148.21(a)(5) shouldbe viewed in the total context of andSection;148.21; when the geology canbe accurately described and the bounds of uncertainty established, thesensitivity analyses may be more sharply defined; when there is some doubtconcerning the geologic description, these analyses must be more broadlydefined. Thus, the definition of what constitutes ``reasonably conservativevalues'' in andSection;148.21(a)(5) would be defined by the degree of certaintywhich results from the use of information from the literature or estimatedvalues. The Agency believes that reasonably conservative values are thosewhich result in models and subsequent operations that are protective ofhuman health and the environment. It is difficult to codify such values,however, in light of the varied wastes, geologies, and operating circumstancesthat are covered under deepwell injection. The Agency believes that specific,suitably conservative values can be established by the reviewer duringthe course of petition evaluation. One commenter believed that andSection;148.21(b)(2) should include the ``layerof protection'' required in 146.62(d)(1). As noted in Section (II)(G)(5)(c)of this preamble, the siting requirements of Part 148 are more stringentthan those of Part 146, and would subsume such Part 146 requirements. Anypetition that satisfies andSection;andSection;148.20 and 148.21 requirementsautomatically meets the requirements of andSection;146.62, with respect toinjected wastes.One commenter noted that, in regards to the geologic information requirementsof andSection;148.21(b), ``* * * Unless the proposed well is located in anarea of dense drilling, the geologic data necessary for mapping [of theinjection site] is likely unavailable.'' Most hazardous waste injectionwells are sited in the Gulf Coast and Great Lakes regions, areas with longhistories of drilling practices, and subsequent extensive geologic mapping.It is true that some facilities exist in areas where little or no previousdrilling has occurred. Again, the amount and density of specific pointsneeded to characterize geology is a function of the degree of isotropyand homogeneity exhibited by the sedimentary basin. The Agency believesthat in many cases the owners or operators of sites may need to gatheradditional geologic data on their sites before a successful petition canbe developed. The Agency believes that detailed geologic mapping is a reasonablerequest in the context of this regulation. A ``no migration'' demonstrationcannot be established without it. One commenter believed that existing and anticipated post-operational verticalfluid density gradients as well as vertical hydraulic gradients shouldbe considered in evaluating the potential for vertical movement. The Agencyagrees, but would like to note that a ``no migration'' demonstration underandSection;148.20 cannot be made without such factors being considered. Several commenters objected to the requirement that, ``All waste and environmentalsampling, test and analysis data shall be accurate and reproducible andperformed in accordance with quality assurance standards.'' They notedthat in many cases, petitions will be based on information gathered duringthe drilling of the well_information which cannot be reproduced in accordancewith procedures specified long after the drilling occurred. These commentersalso noted that much of the data relied upon for characterizing the regionalgeology will be obtained from operations which are conducted by entitiesother than the petitioner. These commenters believed that the net effectof this requirement would be to prohibit the use of vast amounts of data.The geologic descriptions would therefore be less accurate, they contended.The Agency agrees. Excluding historical data or information which mighthave been gathered off-site by methods not consistent with certain prescribedprocedures may be counterproductive. The purpose of andSection;andSection;148.21(a) (5) and (6) should be to allow the use of such data, but assurethat its limitations are accounted for in a petition review. Accordingly,EPA will require that only measurements pertaining to the waste or thatresult from testing performed to gather data for the petition demonstrationcomply with prescribed procedures. The Agency believes, however, that theconcerns about the accuracy of geologic data are addressed more appropriatelyby requiring that the demonstration identify and account for limits ondata quality rather than by excluding data from consideration. Again, andSection;148.21(b), as revised, requires precisely such consideration. Therefore,the demonstration in andSection; 148.20 as promulgated, will allow the useof existing data.I. Procedures for Petition Submission, Review, and Approval or Denial_Section148.22Some commenters stated that the petition review process in the proposalwould not provide an adequate opportunity for public oversight. Commenterssuggested a 45-day period for review, and an opportunity for public hearingsdue to the complex nature of the demonstrations. Other commenters believedthat the proposed petition process is unworkable and would, due to theamount of time necessary to process petitions, result in sound hazardouswaste management practices being outlawed by procedural difficulties. Thesecommenters suggest a generic determination for injection wells and a minormodification approach to changes required in permits.The Agency is doing everything it can to inform and coordinate with theregulated community on petitions, including several outreach meetings andclose coordination with States and Regional offices. The ``hammers'' inthe 1984 HSWA Amendments do create resource and timing problems, but asexplained above, EPA favors the petition process as a way of examiningthe specific hydrogeologic setting for determinations under sections 3004(f) and (g). We further agree that the petition information is complexand the procedures would benefit from a 45-day comment period and the opportunityfor public hearings. We incorporate such provisions in the final rule.In addition, we clarify here that the more extensive public notice provisionsin 40 CFR 124.10 which apply to RCRA permits will apply to the Part 148petition process.In order to minimize the duplication of administrative procedures, we areproviding that the Director may make certain related permit modificationsto the UIC permit contemporaneously with the petition process through theprocedures in andSection; 148.22. These modifications include identificationof an injection zone or an injection interval, redetermination of a well'sarea of review under andSection; 148.20(a)(2)(i), application of a protocolfor location of abandoned wells under andSection; 148.20(a)(2)(ii), submissionof a corrective action plan under andSection; 148.20(a)(2)(iii), and performanceof a radioactive tracer survey under andSection; 148.20(a)(2)(iv). Theseitems will then be enforceable both as permit conditions and as conditionsof the petition. This approach will streamline the process and focus Federaladministrative resources in an efficient manner. State primacy programs will, of course, follow their own permit modificationprocedures. We will try and coordinate as closely as possible with primacystates. As discussed above in Section (II)(G)(5) of this preamble, nothingin this final rule requires permit modifications to satisfy the conditionsof andSection; 148.20. However, we believe a coordinated approach would preventneedless duplication of procedures.J. Review and Termination of Exemptions_Sections 148.23 and 148.24The Agency proposed in andSection; 148.23 that petition demonstrations bereviewed at the time of permit renewals. Under the proposal, the Directorcould require a new demonstration if new information showed that the basisof the demonstration were no longer valid. This section also provided theDirector the authority to require a new demonstration at any time informationindicated that the basis of the showing was not valid or was no longervalid. Section 148.24 listed reasons for which the Director could terminateexemptions, including, in andSection; 148.24(b), mandatory causes for terminatingexemptions. Section 148.24(b) did afford the Director some discretion regardingtermination of exemptions when the source of a release was a faulty wellin the area of review, or a mechanical problem in the injection well itself.Finally, andSection; 148.24(c) specified procedures which the Director mustfollow when terminating exemptions granted under andSection; 148.20.One commenter, supported by several others, noted that if EPA were to adoptalternative procedures for approving petitions (see comments in Section(II)(A)(1) of this preamble) any violation of the demonstration would constituteviolation of the regulations and would, therefore, be enforceable withinthe context of these regulations. The commenter concluded that this sectionwas, under the suggested alternative approach, unnecessary.The commenter went on to say that under any approach, andSection; 148.24(b)is unnecessary and should not be promulgated. According to this commenter,releases from the well or from an abandoned borehole can be fixed by relativelysimple remedial action, and therefore should not be grounds for closinga well. Other commenters contended that any failure of the system shouldbe grounds for automatic termination of the exemption whether or not thesefailures represented simple transient events that did not permanently compromisethe system. Finally, some commenters objected to the procedural requirementsassociated with withdrawing an exemption, contending that it takes toolong.The EPA agrees that if the suggested alternative approach for implementingsections 3004 (f) and (g) were to be adopted, the requirements in andSection;andSection;148.23 and 148.24 could be addressed through enforcement. For the reasonsoutlined in Section (II)(A)(1) of this preamble, however, the Agency isnot adopting any of these alternative approaches.With regards to the grounds for termination, EPA believes that both comemntshave merit. Specifically, there are undoubtably circumstances when a simplefailure of a well plug in an abandoned well or a well component in an injectionwell should not initiate closure or a redemonstration under andSection; 148.20.On the other hand, the Agency believes that the Director should have theauthority to cancel an exemption due to well failure or an improperly abandonedwell in the area of review, in some cases. For example, instances of repeatedwell failures, or numerous problems with wells in the area of review, couldindicate that the corrective action for wells in the area of review hasbeen inadequate, or that the well is not functioning adequately to assuredelivery of the waste to the injection zone. Under such circumstances,the Director should have the authority to revoke exemptions. Accordingly,the Agency believes the Director should have the authority to revoke exemptionsfor the above reasons, but should not be required to do so in all situations.Of course, in cases where the injection zone itself has allowed a release,or where the petitioner has willfully withheld information, the exemptionmust be terminated. The proposed rule provided this level of flexibility,and EPA is therefore promulgating the rule as proposed.Finally, the Agency rejects the contention that the procedural requirementsof andSection; 124.5 are too slow when revocation is considered. The issuesshould be fewer than for petition approval, but will nonetheless benefitfrom full opportunity for public review and comment. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Summary of Today's Rulemaking: Response to Comments; Part 146,Subpart G</ITAG>As outlined in the proposed rule, the Agency is establishing a new SupbartG applicable to owners or operators of hazardous waste injection wells.This section applies to all wells injecting hazardous waste, includingthose injecting wastes which are not yet prohibited, those which meet treatmentstandards promulgated under section 3004(m) of RCRA, and those whose wastehas been banned under section 3004 (f) or (g) of RCRA and who have obtainedan exemption pursuant to Part 148.In the proposal, the Agency established a discrete section, Subpart G,which contained all Part 146 requirements applicable to injectors of hazardouswaste. As indicated, much of Subpart G is merely a reorganization of requirementswhich were originally promulgated in June of 1980 (45 <T3>FR </T3>42473 <T3>et seq.</T3>). It was not EPA's intent to solicit comment on requirementswhich existed by virtue of earlier rulemaking; rather, the Agency intendedto simply recodify these existing requirements and solicit comment on thenew requirements being proposed. The Agency nevertheless received commentson both the new and existing regulations. To the extent that these commenterssought substantive changes to the existing rules, the Agency has evaluatedthem, but, as explained in the proposal, does not believe we are underany obligation to make any changes. In all cases, the Agency will retainthem and evaluate them in the context of any changes which it may contemplatein the future, but the Agency does not believe it is under any obligationto address  comments on existing regulations concurrent with decisionson this rule.A. <T3>General Comments on Part 146</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Stringency of the Regulations</ITAG>Several commenters expressed general support for the reorganization ofPart 146 requirements and the establishment of Subpart G. Many of thesesame commenters, however, believed that the existing Part 146 requirementswere generally adequate to protect USDWs, and were not in need of substantialchanges. These commenters suggested that added specificity, clarifications,updates, and some expansions were all that was warranted. In support ofthis, they noted that contamination of USDWs by injection wells has beenrare, and has not occurred in a facility which is in compliance with existingUIC regulations.Other commenters were supportive of the changes to Part 146, but opinedthat the changes did not go far enough. One commenter submitted instancesof alleged contamination from injection wells in support of his beliefthat more stringent regulation of injection wells was required (Ref. 1).The Agency has examined this report, two other reports conducted by contractors(Refs. 2 and 3), and analyzed the Agency's own Report to Congress performedpursuant to section 701 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of1984 (Ref. 4). Based on this analysis, the Agency cannot point to a bodyof instances which suggest that the existing regulations, and particularlyas amended today, are not sufficiently stringent to protect USDWs. On theother hand, the Agency's experience in implementing  the UIC regulations,as well as experience and knowledge gained from overseeing State implementedprograms, together with information gathered during the section 701 survey,has enabled EPA to identify several important ways to improve the protectivenessof the original regulations. Many of these amendments are being made toaddress specific problems identified in one or more of the studies citedabove. With these amendments, EPA has attempted to develop a set of regulationswhich provides a level of protection appropriate to wells injecting hazardouswaste, yet one which is not unnecessarily burdensome.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Application of Part 146 to andSection; 3004(b)(1)</ITAG>In the preamble to Part 148 the Agency proposed to apply the amended Part146 regulations to satisfy the requirements of section 3004(b)(1). Thissection prohibits the disposal of noncontainerized or bulk liquid hazardouswaste in any salt dome, salt bed formation, underground mine or cave until:(1) The Administrator has determined, after notice of opportunity for hearingsin the record in the affected areas, that such placement is protectiveof human health and the environment (section 3004(b)(1)(A)); (2) The Administratorhas promulgated performance and permitting standards for such facilities(section 3004(b)(1)(B)); and (3) a permit has been issued under section3005(c).The Agency proposed that the amended Part 146 requirements could constituteperformance and permitting standards for such facilities. The Agency alsostated that a UIC permit, which qualifies as a RCRA permit-by-rule underandSection; 270.60, would satisfy the permit requirement. Finally, EPA suggestedthat the  hearing on the petition conducted pursuant to an exemption requestunder Part 148, could be held jointly with the hearing required under section3004(b)(1)(A).One commenter expressed strong support for this approach, but noted thatfor certain types of injection the UIC regulations either may not be appropriateor may need to be applied in a flexible manner. Specifically, injectionof non-liquid fluids could require rules specifically tailored to the problemsinherent to such injection. This commenter proposed specific changes tothe UIC regulations which would make them suitable for regulating non-liquidfluids injected into salt domes. Another commenter expressed strong oppositionto such an approach, stating that liquids dissolve salts, and thus saltformations are unstable and unsuitable for containment of wastes.The Agency has historically regulated fluid injection into salt domes andsalt beds under the UIC program. Under this scheme, a UIC permit issuedunder 40 CFR Part 144, Subpart D, would constitute part of a RCRA permit-by-ruleunder 40 CFR 270.60(b). For injection of liquid hazardous wastes, the EPAbelieves the framework outlined in the proposal is appropriate, and willlargely follow those procedures when permitting injection of liquid hazardouswaste into salt domes and salt beds.A recent final rule, Subpart X of RCRA (52 <T3>FR </T3>49946 <T3>et seq.,</T3> December 10, 1987), addresses regulation of certain unconventionaldisposal practices, including, under some circumstances, injection of non-liquidhazardous fluids. This rule also outlines   in detail the relationshipbetween Subpart X requirements and the UIC permitting. Briefly, SubpartX provides the Agency a flexible permitting scheme that may be appliedto hazardous waste disposal when existing standards are inapplicable. Itis premature to discuss specific features which would make the applicationof Part 146 standards inappropriate. Such determinations will be made inthe context of a facility's permit application.On the technical point concerning the solubility of salt formations, itis common knowledge that salt dissolves in water. However, salt will notfurther dissolve once the water is saturated. In such situations hollowedout salt domes have an excellent combination of high plasticity and lowpermeability to seal against the migration of hazardous wastes. Thus, EPAbelieves such disposal technology to be promising. The acceptablity ofa facility, of course, must be evaluated on a site-specific basis.The Agency has decided that rather than amending the UIC requirements tosuit non-conventional underground emplacement of waste as the one commentersuggested, it will rely on the authority in new Subpart X to develop anappropriate set of requirements in the permit. As noted in the preambleto Subpart X, the decision on whether to regulate unconventional injectionoperations under the UIC program and/or Subpart X is a case-by-case determination(52 <T3>FR</T3> 49953). A more complete discussion of the relationship betweenthe UIC program and the Subpart X requirements is provided in that rulemaking.B. Applicability_Section 146.61Section 146.61 proposed, in part, new definitions applicable to Class Ihazardous waste injection. A number of commenters addressed this section.One Commenter favored codifying in Part 146 the term ``injection interval'',also codified today at andSection; 148.2. The Agency believes that this termis most applicable to facilities petitioning for an exemption under Part148, but believes that the term has utility in the context of certain Part146 requirements. Consequently, EPA is today codifying the term ``injectioninterval'' at andSection;andSection; 148.2 and 146.61(b).A number of commenters were concerned with the new term ``cone of influence''.This definition, and its relationship to the new Area of Review requirements,has been addressed in Section (III)(D) of this preamble.Finally, there were many comments received on the redefinition of the term``existing well'', as it applies to hazardous waste injection. It was theAgency's intention, in redefining this term, to insure that the owner oroperator of an existing authorized well not be subject to those requirementsat andSection; 146.65 which are applicable only to new wells not yet constructed.Two commenters wanted this definition changed to include wells alreadyauthorized to receive non-hazardous fluids, noting that such non-hazardousfluids could eventually be classified as hazardous.Provided that an already authorized, non-hazardous injection well can safelyinject hazardous waste, the Agency agrees with the contention that suchwells should not be classified as ``new wells'' in the context of thisregulation merely because the definition of the waste they are injectingchanges. EPA can foresee a situation where a permitted Class II or IIIwell would become a hazardous waste injection well by virtue of changesin the definition of ``hazardous''. If such a well is able to meet allother applicable 146 and 148 requirements, it should be classified as an``existing well''. Today's promulgation of the term ``existing well'' allowssuch a situation.Another commenter wanted this term to include any Class I well ``permitted,authorized, or constructed'' prior to the effective date of this rule,whereas the proposed definition included only ``authorized''. Per andSection;144.11,any well which is permitted is automatically authorized. Consequently,there is no reason to include the word ``permitted'' in today's redefinitionof ``existing well''. Section 144.11 states that, ``The construction ofany well required to have a permit is prohibited until the permit has beenissued.'' Class I hazardous waste injection is a permitted activity, consequentlyany proposed hazardous waste injection well must receive a permit beforewell construction begins. The situation indicated by the commenter aboveproposes to include constructed, but unauthorized, wells in the spectrumof ``existing wells''. The Agency's legal position is that such a wellis illegal under the terms of the UIC regulations, andSection; 144.11.Two other commenters wanted ``existing well'' redefined to include wellsnot yet completed whose permit applications have been submitted and areunder review, or existing wells whose permits are on appeal. Existing wellswhose permits are under review automatically receive an authorization byrule, pursuant to andSection;andSection; 144.21 or 144.22. Section 124.16 statesthat, for a new facility or new injection well, ``* * * the applicant shallbe without a permit for the proposed new facility * * * [or] * * * injectionwell . . . pending final Agency action.'' In this instance, the well willnot have been constructed yet. Under these circumstances, EPA stronglyurges the applicant and_in the case of primacy states where the amendedrequirements have not been adopted_the Director, to construct or requirethe well to be constructed according to the standards applicable to newwells.C. Siting Requirements_Section 146.62In the proposal, the Agency stated more explicitly requirements which hadbeen stated very broadly in the existing regulations. In the proposal,criteria which had previously been framed as factors which the Directorhad to ``consider'', were expressed as specific requirements which theowner or operator had to meet. Several new, substantive requirements werealso added.In the proposal, the regulations at andSection;146.62(a) restated existinglanguage which required that all Class I wells be sited beneath the lowermostUSDW; andSection;146.62(b) restricted siting to areas that are geologicallysuitable, and defined criteria describing such areas; andSection;146.62(c)specified performance standards for the confining and injection zones;andSection;146.62(d) outlined additional requirements which would providean additional degree of assurance that the waste would be adequately containedor that the site would not otherwise endanger USDWs.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Need for Additional Siting Requirements</ITAG>Nearly all commenters supported the clarification of existing siting requirements,but several maintained there was no need to add more explicit siting requirementsor standards. These commenters believed that absence of contamination incidencessuggested no changes were necessary.The Agency disagrees. The EPA identified several important criteria whichit believes significantly improve the protectiveness of the siting requirements.The UIC program as mandated by the SDWA is preventative in nature, andto the degree that these improvements do not impose unnecessary new burdenson the owner or operator, EPA believes it appropriate to promulgate them.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Consideration of Seismicity in Local Geology</ITAG>Two commenters suggested that andSection;146.62(b)(2), which lists parametersto be considered when evaluating local geology, include consideration ofthe seismic history of the site. The proposed rules, at andSection;146.62(b)(1),required consideration of seismicity on a <T3>regional</T3>, not local basis. The Agency intends to retain the requirementas proposed for several reasons. First, the United States Geologic Survey(USGS) at the request of EPA, recently completed a study on potential earthquakehazards associated with injection wells (Ref. 5). That report recommended<T3>regional</T3> evaluations of tectonic stress as a critical part ofsite evaluations. The Agency believes that concerns of a more local nature,if any, are better addressed by a monitoring program. A more comprehensivediscussion of the USGS report and the role of seismicity in siting andoperating injection wells is provided in Section (III)(I)(6) of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Geologic Criteria</ITAG>Several commenters objected to the requirement in andSection;146.62(b)(3)which required that the site be capable of being modeled accurately. Thesecommenters noted that precise predictions of the location of a plume ora pressure front are not necessary; rather, the modeling must be capableof bounding the problem.EPA agrees. The intent in this section was to be sure that the geologyof the site was not so complex that modeling would not provide meaningfulresults. The Agency was concerned that the complexity of the site not outstripthe technology available to model it. Accordingly, the language is beingrevised to address this specific concern.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Standards Applicable to the Injection and Confining Zone</ITAG>Section 146.62(c) of the proposal contained performance standards whichthe confining zone would have to meet. This section required that the confiningzone be laterally extensive and free of transmissive transecting faultsover an area sufficient to prevent movement of fluids into a USDW. In addition,this section would have required that the confining zone contain at leastone formation of sufficient thickness and with lithologic and stress characteristicscapable of preventing vertical propogation of fractures.There was extensive comment on this provision. Most objected to the requirementsas stated, maintaining that the two provisions were redundant. On the otherhand, one commenter, supported by several others, contended that the presenceof any fault should preclude siting an injection well, regardless of whetherthat fault had the capacity to transmit fluid to overlying zones. Theysuggested that such faults made accurate modeling impossible. These samecommenters suggested that EPA should specify a minimum thickness and permeabilitywhich the confining zone must meet and further, that these parameters bemeasured only in the formation directly adjacent to the injection zone.The Agency agrees that andSection;andSection;146.62(c)(2) (i) and (ii) addresssimilar concerns, but does not believe this suggests that one or the otherrequirement be deleted, as the commenter maintains. It is a common practicein engineering to build safeguards into systems, particularly where uncertaintymay exist, or where the consequences of error are significant. Thus, EPAdoes not believe that the logical consequence of finding that these requirementsoverlap is to delete one or the other of them. Rather, the Agency believesthese requirements to be complementary; together providing a level of assuranceconsistent with the mandate of the SDWA and RCRA.Pertaining to the commenter who suggested specific numerical requirementsapplicable to the confining zone, EPA would like to note that preciselythat option was examined during the course of regulatory negotiations.As outlined in the preamble to the proposal (52 <T3>FR</T3> 32458), the factors which define an acceptable site are oftenqualitative. Specifying a set of quantitative values outside the contextof the myriad other factors that must be considered in siting decisionswould not be effective. To be workable in all cases, these values wouldhave to be so restrictive that safe sites would be prohibited, or the rulewould have to provide the option of allowing the Director the authorityto waive them when not necessary or appropriate. The Agency believes thatit is better to allow consideration of qualitative factors such as theplasticity of the rock, the type and amount of clay in the confining zone,the relative difference in permeability between the injection and confiningzone, the seismicity of the area, the characteristics of the injected andformation fluids, the relative pore pressures, the depth of the injectionzone, and a host of other factors as they relate to defining adequate sitingin the first instance.Finally, one commenter apparently believed the Agency was somehow tryingto restrict the orientation of any fractures developed during well stimulation.This commenter pointed out that below certain depths fractures form ona vertical axis. In response, EPA would like to note that andSection;146.62(c)(2)(ii)pertains to the confining zone, not the injection zone. Moreover, thissection is meant to deal with the vertical <T3>propagation</T3> of fractures, not their vertical orientation. Theexisting rules allow fracturing of the injection zone during well stimulation,and EPA recognizes that these fractures, below certain depths, will beoriented (but not propagated) vertically. Nothing in today's rule altersor attempts to alter the physical fact of a fracture's orientation, orthe operator's right to stimulate the well. The purpose of andSection;146.62(c)(2)(ii)is to be sure that at least one formation has the right mix of thicknessand plasticity to prevent a fracture from moving up (that is verticallypropagating) through the stratigraphic column.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Additional Safeguards</ITAG>Section 146.62(d) outlined four safeguards, one of which the owner or operatorwould have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that hissite shared. They included (1) a showing that a ``buffer'' aquifer/aquicludesystem was present between the confining zone and the base of the lowermostUSDW or (2) a showing that within the area of review the piezometric surfaceof the fluid in the injection zone was lower than the piezometric surfaceof the lowermost USDW or (3) a demonstration that there was no USDW presentor (4) that the geology, nature of the waste, or other considerations wouldnot allow an undiscovered conduit to endanger a USDW.As stated in the proposal, the goal of andSection;146.62(d) was to deal withthe uncertainties which some members of the regulatory negotiation committeebelieved were inherent in characterizing geologic conditions in the subsurface.These requirements were intended to either eliminate the uncertainty involvedin characterizing subsurface geology, or the consequences of failing toidentify a breach in the confining zone, be it a man-made conduit or anatural transmissive fault or fracture.Several commenters objected to the requirement for additional safeguardsin general, and the need for a ``buffer'' aquifer/aquiclude system betweenthe top of the confining zone and the base of the lowermost USDW in particular.They noted that the existing siting requirements, particularly when consideredwith those proposed in andSection; 146.62(c), in conjunction with the Areaof Review requirements and Corrective Action requirements in andSection;andSection;146.63 and 146.64 respectively, adequately addressed concerns about abandonedboreholes or improperly completed wells. One commenter suggested that sinceandSection; 148.20 required the presence of an arresting layer within theinjection zone, and andSection; 146.62(c)(2) specified minimum standardsfor a confining zone, this provision effectively applied a third layerof redundant protection to the siting requirements. The commenter believedthis level of regulation to be excessive.The Agency agrees that the AOR and Corrective Action requirements beingpromulgated today address any conceivable set of concerns which might arisewith respect to abandoned or improperly completed wells within the areaof review. However, the EPA would like to note that the requirements inandSection; 146.62(d) were meant to address more than just abandoned boreholes;they were also meant to address concerns relating to the geology of thesite such as fractures or faults. While EPA does not believe that uncertaintyis ``inherent'' in characterizing geology_given the improvements in remotesensing, techniques of stratigraphic correlations, and borehole logging_theAgency does believe that additional safeguards are appropriate. These safeguardsaddress not only problems which might arise from an undiscovered fault,but also problems which could arise from improper operation. Finally, EPAwould like to reiterate that overlapping safeguards are a sound and frequentlyapplied principle of good engineering. The fact that one set of requirementsaddresses a particular concern does not and should not preclude applicationof other rules which also address the concern.The commenter who thought that EPA was applying a ``third layer of protection''beyond those required in Part 148 and andSection; 146.62(c), apparently didnot understand the relationship between Part 148 and Part 146. First, SubpartC of Part 148 does not apply to all hazardous waste injection wells. Wellswhich inject waste which meets, or has been treated to meet, levels specifiedin 40 CFR Part 268, are not subject to the ``no migration'' provisionsin andSection; 148.20.Second, and more important, the two rules apply complementary, but differentstandards. Part 148 applies a ``no migration'' standard, while Part 146is designed to assure no endangerment of USDWs. The standards in andSection;148.20 were developed to assure that no <T3>injected waste could leave the injection zone. </T3>Part 146 is meantto assure that there will be no endangerment of USDWs, either from injectedfluid <T3>or formation fluids.</T3> With respect to injected fluids, the standardsin 148 are certainly more stringent since they prohibit migration of anyinjected waste at hazardous levels out of the injection zone. However,endangerment encompasses a broader set of concerns and therefore warrantsa broader set of regulatory controls. For example, the area in which <T3>formation fluid</T3> could endanger USDWs is described by the pressurefront induced by injection; the area in which <T3>injected fluid</T3> could move out of the injection zone, on the otherhand, is described by the size of the waste plume. The pressure front isalways larger_usually much more so_than the waste plume.Accordingly, EPA believes it is a mistake to construe that the requirementsof andSection; 148.20 are equivalent to those being applied in andSection;146.62. They do not address the same universe of wells, nor do they addressthe same concerns. The Agency, therefore, rejects the notion that the tworules are redundant and result in an unnecessary third level of protection.A number of commenters objected to the provision in andSection; 146.62(d)(4)which provides the Director the authority to approve a site which lackedone of the specific safeguards outlined in section (d) (1), (2), or (3),but which otherwise could show a comparable level of safety. Most commenters,however, expressed strong support for the provision. In criticizing thesafeguards outlined in the previous three paragraphs, commenters frequentlypointed out scenarios in which the certainty of characterizing the siteaccurately was extremely high, and therefore the need for redundant safeguardslow or non-existent. These commenters noted that in some areas, drillingor other exploration has been extensive enough to provide extremely accuratepictures of the geology of the area and regulatory controls have been inplace and adequately assure that abandoned boreholes have been locatedand plugged. It was such circumstances the Agency sought to address whenproposing andSection; 146.62(d)(4).Commenters who objected to this provision seemed to believe that EPA wassubjecting operators to a lesser standard in andSection; 146.62(d)(4) thanin the other three sections. As one such commenter expressed it, ``EPAhas proposed a broad exception to the siting criteria * * *''. These commentersare apparently confusing the need for a safeguard, where doubt exists,with the standard itself. This section is not an exception to the sitingstandard. It provides another means by which the standard may be met, anotherway in which uncertainty may be resolved.At the heart of this comment appears to be the contention that any andall attempts to describe geology are inherently flawed. The Agency rejectsthis contention, and accordingly will promulgate this section as proposed.Finally, some commenters were concerned that this latitude might be abusedby those implementing the UIC program. The EPA notes that all permit decisionsare subject to rigorous public participation requirements. If, in an individualcase, a State Director exercises the discretion afforded him too broadly,the public will have ample opportunity to comment, and, if necessary, challengehis decision. If such an abuse is systematic, EPA will take appropriateaction as part of the Agency's oversight responsibilities.D. Area of Review_Section 146.63One of the key changes proposed for the Class I regulations was the expansionof the area of review (AOR). The AOR pertains to the area within whichthe owner or operator must identify all wells penetrating the confiningzone and the injection zone and determine whether they have been properlycompleted or plugged and abandoned. In existing UIC regulations it is definedeither by a fixed radius of \1/4\-mile from the well bore or by a calculated``zone of endangering influence.'' As a result of the information gatheredduring the andSection; 701 survey of hazardous waste injection wells, concernsraised by the regulatory negotiation committee, and information developedfrom recent research on well failures, EPA proposed to amend the area ofreview requirements for hazardous waste injection wells by extending thearea to be examined for abandoned or improperly completed wells to an areawith a radius of 2\1/2\ miles from the injection well bore or, in somecircumstances, the calculated ``cone of influence'' of the well.The ``cone of influence'' defines the area of review as the area describedby the incremental increase in pressure caused by the injection well. TheAgency believes that the pressure of concern should be the increment overbackground, static pressure conditions since that is the pressure resultingfrom the regulated activity.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Increase in the Size of the Area of Review </ITAG>The Agency received many comments on the proposal to increase the sizeof the area of review. Several commenters indicated that the 2\1/2\-mile area of review was unnecessarilylarge and would require the well operators to conduct lengthy record searchesthat are time-consuming and costly, possibly even precluding the drillingof Class I injection wells in the very cases where geologic data was mostreliable. In addition, other commenters stated that the proposed area ofreview was totally arbitary with no technical basis and that using a calculatedcone of influence for the well was adequate, especially if the calculatedarea was substantially less than the 2\1/2\-mile minimum requirement. In reply, the Agency notes that recent studies on the consequences of wellfailures suggest that the single most significant potential source of contaminationfrom injection wells would be an unplugged borehole within the area ofreview where there exists a pressure sufficient to drive fluids up theborehole (Refs. 6 and 7). EPA also notes that the State of Texas whichspecifies a 2\1/2\-mile AOR, and the State of Louisiana, which specifiesa 2-mile AOR, currently regulate over 60 percent of the wells injectinghazardous waste. These States do not give exceptions to their area of reviewrequirements, therefore enlarging the area of review does not significantlyincrease the burden for the majority of operators. Even where there isan increase in burden, the Agency believes that the special characteristicsof hazardous waste injection warrant a margin of safety more stringentthan for other wastes. The Agency believes that a larger fixed radius isnot capricious or without some technical basis, as our research in abandonedwell studies indicates (Ref. 6 and 7). Also, during the course of regulatorynegotiation, State regulators noted that an area of review between 2 and2\1/2\ miles represented an appropriate maximum radius based on their fieldobservations of hundreds of injection wells. However, the Agency believesthe intent of the enlarged area of review can be met adequately with a2 mile minimum, rather than a 2\1/2\-mile area of review. The 2-mile areaof review has the advantage of not disrupting existing state programs ofsubstantial size. Under today's rule, the Director will have the authorityto enlarge the area of review beyond two miles if he has reason to believethat a larger area of review is necessary. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Calculation of the Area of Review </ITAG>Many comments were received concerning the calculation of the area of review.One commenter believed that the area of review should be fixed at the 2\1/2\-mileradius value for all wells and not calculated as there appears to be toomuch confusion on how to calculate an area of review. In contrast, anotherproposed that the area of review should have a 10-mile fixed minimum radiusfrom the injection well and expressed a lack of confidence in a well operator'sability to either model or calculate the cone of influence. Accordingly,they believed the 2\1/2\-mile minimum requirement was not restrictive enough.The Agency has confidence in the mathematical calculations for the coneof influence. Pressure buildup is well understood, and the effects of injectioncan be accurately identified. There may very well be sites where a calculatedarea of review in excess of 2 miles is indicated. For such sites, today'srule would provide the Director with the authority to require an AOR inexcess of 2 miles. However, a 10-mile radius minimum area of review isextremely large and to prescribe for every injection well such an AOR wouldplace an unnecessary burden on both the well operator and the regulatoryagencies conducting the review, without adding further protection to theenvironment. One commenter suggested that the area of review should only be tied towaste plume migration rather than calculated from reservoir pressure. EPA would like to note that the primary concern which andSection; 146.63addresses is the endangerment of USDWs, regardless of whether that endangermentwould result from highly mineralized brines in the injection or interveningformations, or from the injected waste stream. In all cases, an area ofreview based on the waste plume would be significantly smaller than onebased on the pressure increase during the operational life of the well,and would therefore not prevent endangerment. Moreover, the long term concernsassociated with plume movement after the well is plugged, are addresedin the modeling performed under andSection; 148.20. Accordingly, EPA willcontinue to base AOR on pressure buildup. A few commenters indicated that the language proposed by the Agency forthe determination of the area of review was unclear and suggested thatthe Agency provide one method of calculating the area of review to serveas a guidance for all affected states. Finally, some commenters were concernedthat one interpretation of the regulation could require a calculated areaof review which extends indefinitely in order to satisfy the reviewingregulatory agency. These commenters suggested that such a calculated infinitearea of review should be spatially limited by the Agency to avoid thispotential problem. The Agency believes that a guidance may be necessary to clarify the methodsappropriate for establishing area of review, but does not believe thata single calculation, or a set of calculations, describes the universeof acceptable methods for determining area of review. Moreover, prescribingby regulation the appropriate method could preclude permittees from usingmore sophisticated methods which might become available at some futurepoint. Therefore, the Agency is not specifying particular methods of calculatingan area of review in this rule. The Agency also recognizes that calculations may result in an asymptote,or that in some physical settings the formation pressure will contributeto an AOR that extends over great distances. Under current State and Federally-implementedrules, the problem of infinite asymptotes has been addressed by settingcut-off points when the slope of the pressure curve flattens. It is notEPA's intent that operators ``chase asymptotes'' when no real potentialendangerment resulting from the well exists. The physical settings whichmight result in calculated AORs in excess of 2 miles involve highly overpressurizedformations. As noted in the proposal, overpressurization can be evidencethat the formation is effectively a closed system. Where natural or man-madepoints of discharge exist, pressure will begin to equilibrate, and theexcess pressure will tend to ``bleed off''. Absent such leaks, the systemwill retain excess pressure. Moreover, such systems are more likely tobe static, resulting in very little or no flow over time. Accordingly,EPA still believes the appropriate AOR is described by the pressure fromthe well injection, and further believes that in the vast majority of cases,that this area is described by a 2-mile area of review. Accordingly, the Agency is now specifying in today's rule, a fixed 2-mileminimum area of review. But in recognition that in some circumstances anarea of review may be greater than 2 miles, the Director has the discretionto require a larger area of review. One such reason may be the cone ofinfluence, which must still be calculated and provided by the owner oroperator to the Director for his determination of whether corrective actionwould be required for abandoned or improperly completed wells.E. Corrective Action for Wells in the Area of Review_Section 146.64The Agency proposed additional corrective action requirements and proposedreorganization and consolidation of the current regulations as andSection;andSection;146.64and 146.70 in Subpart G. In general, as proposed, andSection;146.64 statesthe requirements for corrective action and andSection;146.70 outlines theinformation required to show compliance with them. The following responseconcerns comments received for corrective action requirements in andSection;146.64.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Application of the Area of Review</ITAG>Under existing regulations, the owner or operator must submit a plan concerningthe steps taken to address improperly completed or abandoned wells withinthe area of review, but he is not required to submit a protocol for identifyingall wells within the area of review. The Agency proposed to require thatan owner or operator submit such a protocol to the Director outlining howhe intends to identify all wells within the area of review, and how heintends to determine whether these wells have been adequately completedor plugged. The Director would be required to review the plan, determinewhether it is adequate, and either approve it, modify it, or deny the application.An approximately equal number of commenters supported and opposed thisproposed amendment. Several commenters specifically indicated that correctiveaction should be limited to only the wells within the cone of influence,not the proposed 2\1/2\ mile radius area of review. Some commenters alsocited the problems, both legal and logistic, associated with wells locatedon property not owned by the applicant as a reason to limit the scope ofcorrective action. The Agency will not, however, require corrective actionon wells within the area of review if it can be effectively demonstratedthat there is no potential to move fluids through a conduit. In responseto the first concern, it is EPA's intent to assure that all wells withinthe area of review are identified and evaluated. EPA would like to notethat in some cases, some wells outside of the cone of influence may haveto be evaluated in a petition demonstration under part 148; for example,where the formations are naturally overpressured and where there is significantflow.One commenter also contended that corrective action requirements were notfeasible in many cases because the operators could not compel other ownersof wells off their property to fix wells. The existing rules allow theapplicant an alternative to fixing these off-property wells. If the coneof influence is very large or if the applicant cannot access improperlyplugged or abandoned wells outside of his property, he may seek from theDirector permission to reduce the area within which wells must be fixedby reducing pressure and thereby satisfying corrective action requirements.This provision is merely a restatement of existing requirements. As such,the Agency is neither seeking comment, nor anticipating making any changes,such as allowing pressure limitations at the discretion of the operator,as one commenter seeks. EPA believes that the issue of when pressure limitsmay be used in order to satisfy corrective action should be at the Director'sdiscretion. The Director may choose to limit its use, for example, in acase where the operator has violated pressure limitations in the past.Pressure limitations, however, are not the preferred means of meeting correctiveaction and EPA will limit its uses to cases where the Director deems itappropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Abandoned Well Protocol</ITAG>The greatest number of comments received concerning corrective action addressedthe information and substance required in the protocol for identifyingwells in the area of review. Several commenters were of the opinion thatthe Agency should indicate the necessary steps to establish such a protocol,the information to be contained in a protocol, and the specific requirementsconcerning the search methods for abandoned wells. Some commenters feltthat the specific methods of abandoned well searches should be indicatedwhile at least one commenter argued that, except in unusual cases, it wasinappropriate for an applicant to use any methods other than a search ofpublic records provided by local, state, and federal agencies. In any case,one commenter also felt that once wells were identified, the evaluationof wells merely penetrating into the confining zone was unnecessary andsuch evaluation for corrective action was unwarranted.In general response to these comments, the Agency believes that a technicalguidance may be necessary to further explain protocol requirements. However,the Agency also believes, particularly in cases where public well recordsare poor or non-existent, that just a cursory search of well records isinadequate where hazardous waste injection is concerned. Furthermore, EPAalso believes that the time to evaluate well search methodology is priorto the initiation of the search and not after. The Agency plans to issuea UIC guidance on this protocol in the near future.Finally, EPA believes that it is necessary to look at all wells penetratingthe confining zone in order to determine if a problem could develop bythe reduction of thickness of the confining material caused by such penetration.The evaluation of these wells does not compel corrective action unlessthe integrity of the confining zone is compromised. Therefore the reviewnecessitated by this possibility is exactly what the Agency is requiringin the regulations and the regulations will be promulgated as initiallyproposed.F. Construction Requirements_Section 146.65The amendments for construction requirements reflect the Agency's attemptto achieve an appropriate balance between specific design standards andmore general performance standards. Current regulations describe a verybroadly structured performance standard and list specific factors thatthe Director must consider when evaluating the construction of a well.As a result of the Agency's consideration of historical well constructionpractices within states, the section 701 report to Congress, and the needfor a more clearly defined set of standards, the Agency is increasing thespecificity of the construction requirements and adding some new requirements.The changes in construction requirements outlined in andSection;146.65 include:additional criteria in overall performance standards; more explicit compatibilityrequirements; and certain requirements for owners and operators injectingthrough a well equipped with fluid seals. In addition, andSection;146.65(c)(1),which addresses requirements for new wells, contains a more specific articulationof the performance standards outlined in andSection;146.65(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Construction Concerns</ITAG>There appeared to be general support for the requirements outlined in andSection;146.65(a).One commenter indicated support for requiring wells to be constructed toallow the use of appropriate testing devices and workover tools. Anothercommenter indicated that in andSection;146.65(a)(3), injection ``tube'' shouldbe changed to injection tubing. The Agency has made the correction.One commenter, supported by several others, objected to the requirementthat new wells be constructed in a manner that allowed the use of appropriatelogging and testing devices. This commenter contended that the best meansof preventing a future leak was to assure proper construction of the wellin the first place. The commenter went on to suggest that allowing thedesign and construction to be dictated by testing requirements could becounterproductive.The Agency rejects this argument. The commenter apparently assumes thereare instances when the considerations pertaining to proper constructionand those associated with the ability to adequately test the well are mutuallyexclusive. The Agency is stating that both goals, proper construction andthe ability to adequately test the well, are legitimate and complementaryaims that must be considered during the construction of a new well.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Well Materials and Compatibility Requirements</ITAG>For the section concerning well compatibility requirements, a number ofcommenters indicated that a published standard for the materials used inwell construction, and their compatibility with the wastes, may not exist.Also, they were of the opinion that a well operator should not be deemedin violation of a permit based on material standards since these standardsare usually developed for new materials and generally do not apply oncethe material is placed in service in a well. The Agency has indicated inthis regulation that in cases where an operator chooses to use an exoticwell material for which no published or recognized standards exist, comparablestandards acceptable to the Director would need to be developed. Therefore,the owner or operator does have this provision as an option to a bonafideAmerican Petroleum Institute (API) or American Society of Testing Methods(ASTM) or other published standard. The Agency is also cognizant that wellmaterials may deteriorate with use and time, but notes that published standardsgenerally specify limits which are acceptable during the service life ofthe material, not merely upon installation.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Casing and Cementing</ITAG>There were several comments pertaining to the casing and cementing of newwells. One commenter suggested deletion of the requirement that surfacecasing must extend below the lowest formation containing a USDW. EPA rejectsthis suggestion. The Agency has determined that having two strings of cementedcasing, the surface and long string casing, affords significantly greaterprotection to USDWs than a single string of cemented casing.Another commenter sought a specific prescribed depth of penetration bythe surface casing into the confining bed below the lowest formation containinga USDW. This is a site-specific issue and should be established in thecontext of permitting. One commenter also informed us that in the arctic,the section of the annulus through the permafrost must be filled with anon-freezing fluid to prevent collapse of the long string casing. Circulationof cement to the surface upon setting the casing is therefore precludedin these cases. The Agency acknowledges this problem and notes that andSection;144.16allows the Director discretion in approving alternative cementing programswhere no USDW exists, as is the case with the commenter's well. Moreover,andSection;146.65 allows the Director to approve alternatives even wherea USDW is present.The Agency also requested, in the proposed rule, comments pertaining tothe 120% of calculated volume of cement required to be circulated to thesurface when setting casing. In particular, EPA sought comment on whethermore than 120% of the calculated volume should be required. Most of thecommenters responding to our request for information replied that the 120%cement volume figure was sufficient, although some believed it to be inadequate,and others excessive. In consideration of this response, the Agency believesthat this minimum amount of recirculation is adequate in most cases. However,EPA has incorporated new language in today's rule which would allow theDirector to require more, not less, than 120% cement in excess of calculatedhole volume if he determines that geologic and construction conditionswarrant such an increase.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Mechanical Packers and Fluid Seals</ITAG>The last section of andSection;146.65 concerns tubing, packer, and fluidseals. The greatest number of commenters in this section sought a changein the proposed language of the requirement that the packer be placed abovethe injection zone. The Agency agrees that in many cases it is indeed preferableto set the packer either at the top of, or within, an injection zone, andalso that some flexibility in the placement of the packer during the lifeof the well is needed. Therefore, EPA has included new language in thissection which will allow the packer to be located as approved by the Director.A few commenters were of the opinion that the design standard which proposedthat testing and monitoring requirements for fluid seals be as stringentas those for wells constructed with tubing and packer was excessive. TheAgency disagrees and believes that these requirements are justified inlight of the complexity of the application and maintenance of fluid sealsin general. The Agency continues to be of the opinion that the simplicityof the mechanical packer is preferable in most cases. However, andSection;146.65(d)(3)would allow the owner or operator to install a fluid seal provided he demonstratesto the Director that the fluid seal will provide a level of protectionequal to or exceeding that which a packer-equipped well would provide.Many commenters supported our allowance of fluid seals, and contended thatsuch seals could provide protection superior to packers.G. Logging, Sampling, and Testing_Section 146.66The requirements pertaining to logging, testing, and sampling have beenconsolidated into andSection;146.66 in today's rule from existing andSection;andSection;146.12(d)and 146.14(b). In addition, the Agency is changing the requirements inseveral important ways. As indicated in the August 27, 1987, proposed rule,these requirements apply only to new hazardous waste wells.The first change in the regulations defines the goals of this section.The establishment of baseline data prior to injecting against which futurelogging and testing can be reassessed is an important new use of data.The Agency believes this to be an important concept: the future utilityof many logs is dependent on having base logs against which to compare.Therefore, the operator's ability to demonstrate compliance at some futuretime may depend on what logs he ran when the well was first constructed.EPA believes that detailed logging prior to injecting can be of benefitto both the regulator and the permittee.Another change proposed involved the tests required both before the castingis set and after it is in place. The wording in existing andSection; 146.12(d)(2)was unclear in regard to whether all of the tests outlined were mandatoryor only one subset was needed. The language in today's andSection; 146.66clearly indicates that all of the listed tests must be conducted. Thisregulation also reflects the concern of some members of the regulatorynegotiation committee that the technologies used to test wells were rapidlyevolving and that by allowing the Director to approve an equivalent alternative,improved tests would not be eliminated from consideration. Thus the languagein this regulation allows the Director to approve an alternative or additionaltest when he deems it appropriate. The Agency is also effectively changingthe mechanical integrity requirements in andSection; 146.68(d). Now an initialdemonstration of mechanical integrity for new wells must be made as indicatedin current andSection; 146.66(a)(3). A more detailed discussion outliningthe Agency's rationale for more stringent MIT requirements is found inthe section of this preamble which addresses andSection; 146.68, Testingand Monitoring Requirements. Although pre-existing regulations in andSection; 146.12(a)(15) require theDirector to evaluate an operator's coring program prior to the grantingof a permit, this provision did not place a burden on the Director to requirecoring, or on the operator to conduct it. Also, EPA wanted to provide theDirector the authority to require coring of formations other than the injectionand confining zones. The Agency maintains that the relatively inexpensivetask of coring is justifiable in view of the information it provides. Today'srule states the coring requirement more prescriptively and affords theDirector the authority to require cores from other formations. The Agencybelieves, however, that the situations in which the Director would wantto require coring of formations other than the injection or confining zonesshould be relatively rare. Another change now requires the owner or operator to conduct pump or injectivitytests to identify the hydrogeologic properties of the injection zone throughan empirical method. These tests have the advantage of yielding an aggregatefigure which represents an entire stratum or several strata. The originalregulations required the Director to ``consider'' the owner or operator'sformation testing program, therefore the Agency does not see this restatedrequirement as a substantive change. In andSection; 146.66(f), the Agency proposed language which would assurethat the Director has the opportunity to witness logging or testing proceduresby requiring the permittee to submit a schedule of testing activities atleast 30 days prior to conducting the specified tests. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Coring </ITAG>The greatest number of comments pertaining to the andSection; 146.66 requirementsconcerned coring. Many commenters indicated that coring was prohibitivelyexpensive to the owner or operator. Some were concerned that sidewall orcontinuous cores could not always be retrieved from certain formationsin the well bore. Other commenters indicated that the information soughtfrom cores could be obtained from adjacent well cores if it could be demonstratedthat the zones of interest were correlative in each well. The remainingcomments on coring challenged the Director's authority for requiring coringfrom formations other than the injection or confining zones. As we havealready stated, the Agency believes that the information obtained fromcoring justifies the expense. Also, EPA is not requiring coring in existingwells, only in newly drilled wells. The Agency agrees that continuous coreretrieval is not always possible, but sidewall cores are usually recoverableand are acceptable. As noted in the proposal, if EPA were to limit its ability to collect relevantdata, the Agency might be placed in the position of having to turn downan otherwise approvable site simply because adequate data wasn't available.In particular, flexibility in siting requirements is dependent on the extentof data available. Today's rule will contain language which would allowthe Director discretion in accepting core information from nearby wellsin the few cases where core retrieval was impossible in a newly drilledwell. With regard to requiring cores and other logs from formations other thanthe injection and confining zone, EPA disagrees with commenters who maintainthat it is unnecessary. Section 1422 of The Safe Drinking Water Act ispreventative in nature. The UIC regulations are designed to prevent endangermentof USDWs regardless of whether that endangerment results from highly mineralizedformation fluids, or from injected wastes. Thus, the Agency can envisioncircumstances when it will be necessary to obtain data on strata lyingbetween the lowermost USDW and the confining zone to assure that such endangermentis not occurring. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Data Collection Requirements </ITAG>There were numerous comments to the proposed rule pertaining to the requirementsfor individual logs and other data collection procedures. Several commentersbelieved that information collection requirements relating to this sectionof the regulations should not be arbitrarily applied to zones other thanthe injection and confining zone. As EPA indicated in the earlier proposaland mentioned in the comment response to coring operations, the Agencybelieves that it is not being arbitrary in requiring certain types of informationfrom other formations penetrated by the well. EPA believes that the statuteand regulations require that such information be considered. The regulationsnow contain a provision which would necessitate information gathering onthe formation immediately below the lowermost USDW. For these reasons,EPA believes it necessary to have the authority to require informationon the formations found in the wellbore, including logging, coring, testing,and formation fluid sampling, other than the injection and confining zonesalone. Therefore, we are promulgating this requirement as proposed. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Logging Tool Concerns </ITAG>One commenter indicated that the language in the proposed regulation concerningdeviation checks should be rephrased to indicate that this type of procedurewas performed during and not after the drilling of the well. The Agencyagrees and an appropriate language changes has been made to eliminate anyconfusion on this procedure. Several commenters questioned the utilityof the Fracture Finder Log and also indicated that the language in theproposed regulation could be interpreted as indicating that this log wasto be run after and not before setting a casing string. The Agency believesthat a Fracture Finder Log is very useful in determining the presence orabsence of fractures in close proximity to the well bore and is an essentialpart of ensuring that all necessary data regarding fractures in the injection,confining, or other relevant formations has been collected. This log alsohelps establish strike and dip, which can be invaluable in characterizingstratigraphy. Therefore, the Agency will continue to require this log forall newly constructed wells. However, the Agency has rephrased andSection;146.66(a)(2)(ii)(B) to clearly indicate that this log should be run priorto setting casing. The language also allows the Director the discretionto waive this log requirement where he determines that other informationwould suffice, or where the application of this log, such as in unconsolidatedsediments, has proven to be ineffective. Several commenters pointed out that there could be some confusion by ownersor operators in the terminology of ``density log'' as used in andSection;146.66(a)(2)(i)(B) and andSection; 146.66(a)(2)(ii)(C). The Agency is awarethat the required log is not an open-hole formation evaluation densitylog, but rather a variable density log run in conjunction with a cementbond log or other cement evalution log. The appropriate terminology hasbeen inserted in today's rule. One commenter indicated that the proposed rule in andSection; 146.66(d) requiresonly a calculation of the fracture pressure of the injection and confiningzones. The commenter maintained that such calculations were subject touncertainties of 10% or even more. In view of this, they suggested thatonly a direct measurement should be accepted. The Agency's study pertainingto earthquake hazards and seismicity (Ref. 5) indicates that the most reliablemethod of making such measurements is by direct methods, such as hydraulicfracturing. However, the Agency believes that in some cases, the Directorshould have the discretion to accept equivalent methods or calculations,or to rely on existing data. For example, in many cases there exists asubstantial body of historical information which will enable fracture pressuresto be calculated with great precision. In such instances, EPA believesthat the Director should have the discretion to accept such calculations,and is therefore promulgating the rule as proposed. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Witnessing of Logging and Testing Procedures </ITAG>Finally, several comments were received concerning andSection; 146.66(f),which gives the Director the opportunity to witness all required loggingand testing. All of these comments stated that the 30-day notificationby an operator to the Director prior to the first test or log was too long,and that a 24-hour, or at most a few-day prior notification period wasadequate. They indicated that often last minute changes occur which couldrender the schedule maeaningless. The Agency is simply requiring that theDirector be provided with a schedule of planned logging, coring, or testingactivities 30 days before these operations take place. Any changes in theanticipated time of logging, testing, or other activity can be communicatedto the Director as agreed upon by the concerned parties. The schedule isneeded in order for the Director to determine whether these activitiesneed to be witnessed. H. Operating Requirements_Section 146.67 Proposed andSection; 146.67 outlined operating requirements applicable tohazardous waste well owners/operators. Extensive comments were receivedon this section. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Annulus Pressure Requirements </ITAG>Many commenters addressed andSection; 146.67(c), which requires, under mostcircumstances, the maintainance of an annulus pressure that exceeds theoperating pressure. This amendment was included to insure that a leak inthe tubing would result in annulus fluid moving into the tubing, not inwaste moving into the annulus. Some commenters supported this amendment.The majority of commenters on this section felt that Director discretionwas necessary in the application of this requirement when the mechanicalintegrity of the well might be adversely affected by the pressure differential.Others said that in certain situations, leak detection can be more effectivelycarried out when injection pressures exceed annulus pressures. One commenterrequested that this requirement be waived if no USDWs are within the Areaof Review. The Agency believes that the proposed language, ``* * * unlesssuch a requirement might harm the integrity of the well * * *'' providesDirector discretion and adequate permitting flexibility for instances whena positive hydrostatic balance across the injection tubing could lead toloss of mechanical integrity. No examples of superior leak detection insituations where injection pressures exceed annulus pressures were providedby any commenter.Generally, EPA does not believe that lack of a USDW within the Area ofReview is an adequate reason to stay this requirement for wells injectinghazardous waste. However, the existing UIC regulations at andSection; 144.16do allow the Director the authority to waive certain construction and otherpermit requirements. The Agency intends that this authority be limitedin application for wells injecting hazardous waste, but does recognizethat specific circumstances may warrant application of this exemption.The Agency believes that andSection; 146.67(c) contains considerable flexibilityand is therefore promulgating it as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Continous Recording and Alarm Requirements</ITAG>The Agency proposed, in andSection; 146.67(f), to require an operator tocontinuously monitor the injected fluid. In addition, EPA proposed to requirethe owner or operator to install either automatic shutoff systems or, incases where the owner would verify that an operator was on site at alltimes, automatic alarms. These systems would sound an alarm or shut-inthe system whenever pressures or flow rates exceeded a range or gradientspecified in the permit.The Agency received extensive comment on this provision, much of it supportingthe requirement, but objecting to the specific parameters outlined in theproposal. Most commenters suggested that the appropriate value to monitorwas the injection pressure and/or the annulus pressure. A few commenterswere concerned that requiring such devices could result in the facilitybeing shut down by ``false alarms''. These commenters noted that operatingparameters frequently vary within an acceptable range as a result of changesin temperature, density, or other physical changes. These changes, accordingto the commenters, frequently fall well within permit standards.The Agency agrees with these comments. Effective automatic shutoff or alarmsystems may be designed to react to a combination of several key parameters,including those specified in the proposal. Accordingly, the final rulewill afford the Director more discretion in deciding which parameters toinclude in the permit. With regard to the commenters concerned about ``falsealarms'', EPA notes that the range of values which can be acceptable (i.e.those which would not trigger an alarm or shutoff system) is defined inthe permit, and can be designed so that the parameters may vary withinspecified limits which may be both protective and sufficiently flexibleto avoid unnecessary shut-ins.A few commenters questioned the need to monitor continuously for one orthe other of the temperature, flow rate, volume or injection pressure.Others suggested that the list be expanded to include other parameterssuch as density.The Agency is seeking to identify information in this section which helpscharacterize operational characteristics of the well. Changes in any ofthe parameters outlined could affect the way the well operates or obscurethe interpretation of reported values (for example, increases in temperatureresult in increased annulus pressures). The very flexibility which thesecommenters sought in the application of this requirement can be allowedonly when the Director has access to the parameters outlined.Requiring additional parameters to be reported is not necessary. The Agencyis not seeking to define the physical and chemical properties of the wastein this requirement. That is being required in andSection; 146.68(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Fault and Fracture Propagation</ITAG>A few commenters addressed andSection; 146.67(a), which concerns the initiationand propagation of undesired faults and fractures. One wanted this sectionchanged to allow for a ``bulb'' around the well bore within which horizontalfracturing of the injection zone would be permitted. The Agency believesthat the integrity of an injection zone is in part contingent upon theexistence of few or no vertical fractures within the injection zone. Inthe context of well stimulation, both vertical and horizontal fracturingare permissible when they will assist in the creation of additional safe,disposal area within the injection interval, but will not allow fracturingof the confining zone. All other pressure-induced fracturing within theinjection zone is impermissible.Another commenter felt that andSection; 146.67(a) was unspecific in its requirementsconcerning allowable injection pressure, allowable fracturing during stimulation,and margins of safety. The Agency has promulgated Part 146 as a regulatoryframework for both Primacy and Federally implemented states. As such, Part146 specifies broad minimum standards which define acceptable State programs.The additional precision which the commenter requested can be found inthe individual State programs in primacy States, or in Part 147 for Federally-administeredprograms. Part 146 was never intended to detail to the letter permit requirements.Rather it sets broad parameters within which permits are to be issued.The Agency believes the operating requirements proposed at Part 146.67(a)are appropriate for minimum standards, since there is a great deal of disparityin fracture gradients from State to State and even within a single State.I. Testing and Monitoring Requirements_Section 146.68The requirements for testing and monitoring are addressed in andSection;146.68. The Agency indicated in the August 27, 1987, proposed regulationthat this section restates existing requirements more explicitly, changessome substantively, and adds new requirements. This section also adds arequirement for a waste analysis plan, establishes more precise standardsfor hydrogeologic compatibility determinations, specifies the requirementsfor the compatibility of well materials and monitoring, revises and strengthensmechanical integrity testing, and establishes more specific ambient monitoringrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Waste Analysis Plan</ITAG>The written waste analysis plan requires a description of how the wastewill be analyzed and sampled and how the analysis will assure that thesamples will be representative. The approach adopted by the Agency followsandSection; 264.13(b) of the RCRA regulations and the Agency believes thisto be a sensible approach. Most hazardous waste injection well operatorswill have surface units subject to RCRA and will have a plan already developed.One comment received for the waste analysis plan suggested that a guidancewas needed for specifying the detailed chemical and physical analysis neededfor this requirement. The Agency believes that a guidance is necessary,and will issue it as soon as possible. Indeed, this guidance is under developmentin response to similar concerns regarding andSection; 264.13(b). It willbe issued as expeditiously as possible.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Hydrogeologic Compatibility</ITAG>The approach to addressing hydrogeologic compatibility requires the operatorto submit a plan which identifies anticipated reaction products and demonstratesto the Director's satisfaction that neither the waste nor the reactionproducts would adversely affect the injection or confining zone. In otherwords, both the injection and confining zones must continue to satisfysiting requirements in andSection; 146.62. This amendment clarifies and addssome specificity to existing regulations in andSection;andSection; 146.12 and146.14, but does not substantially alter them.Several concerns were indicated regarding hydrogeologic compatibility requirements.One commenter maintained that this requirement was already addressed inthe andSection; 148.20 petition process. The petition process, however, doesnot cover all hazardous waste injection. Moreover, for the foreseeablefuture, EPA will be implementing the petition process, while in many cases,States are implementing Part 146 requirements. Thus, the data may not beavailable for States to determine compliance.Another commenter expressed the opinion that compatibility should onlybe required for the arresting layers of the injection zone and not theconfining zone. The Agency disagrees and believes that in order to meetthe siting requirements in andSection; 146.62, an assessment of hydrogeologiccompatibility of the confining layer must be made.One commenter sought a change in the language addressing cases in whichthe waste stream in an existing well changes. The commenter believed thatsuch a change should require the Director to take into account what theformation is like at the time of the change for the assessment of hydrogeologiccompatibility. The Agency believes that this concern is addressed in theexisting requirement. The owner or operator must provide information acceptableto the Director that the relevant protection characteristics of the confiningand injection zones are not compromised. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Compatibility with Well Materials </ITAG>Section 146.68(c) requires that the owner or operator of the hazardouswaste well provide assurance that the materials in the well are compatiblewith the injected fluid. Corrosion monitoring, generally accomplished byexposing well components or coupons to the waste stream, provide the necessarydata for addressing well material compatibility. Several commenters contendedthat continuous corrosion monitoring was usually unnecessary particularlywhen a non-corrosive waste stream is injected. Others suggested that suchmonitoring should be required in all cases, regardless of whether the wastemay be corrosive nor not. The Agency believes that in many cases, the rates of corrosion can be accuratelypredicted, particularly in wells with a long operating history and witha waste stream of a consistent composition. The Agency has therefore affordedthe Director some latitude in requiring monitoring, as indicated in andSection;146.68(c)(1);the owner or operator needs only to demonstrate to the Director that thewaste stream will be compatible with well materials in contact with thewastes. However, the Agency will require continuous corrosion monitoringof the well construction materials used in the well for wells injectingcorrosive wastes. The Director is given the discretion to require suchmonitoring for other wastes, but alternative methods may be approved bythe Director. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Mechanical Integrity Testing </ITAG>Current mechanical integrity tests (MITs) require the operator to checkfor fluid movement behind the casing (including movement of formation fluidsthrough cement channels adjacent to the well bore) and for leaks in thetubing, casing, or packer. These tests are to be run at least once everyfive years. The frequency of testing was especially controversial whenthe UIC regulations were initially proposed and promulgated (see 45 <T3>FR </T3>42500 <T3>et seq.,</T3> June 24, 1980), and for this reason, in part, EPA includedandSection;146.15 which specified that the EPA would review the adequacyof certain requirements, including MIT tests. After analyzing annual andquarterly reports and reviewing the results of the section report, theAgency has concluded that the frequency of certain tests is inadequateand that certain other tests not specified in existing regulations shouldbe added. In several instances, problems developed and evolved within afive-year time period. While these problems were detected by routine monitoring,it suggestes that the MIT testing frequency needs to be increased. In view of these concerns, EPA is now requiring annual pressure tests andis also requiring the operator to conduct an annual radioactive tracersurvey (RTS) for wells injecting hazardous waste. This test is requiredin many State programs and has been approved by EPA for use in federally-implementedprograms. Moreover, RTS tests are effective for locating leaks in the bottomhole cement and they can be utilized for leak detection of a well's tubulargoods, and in some instances fluid flow behind casing. In addition, theAgency is now requiring the use of a tool to evaluate the casing priorto operating the well for new wells, and at least once every five yearsthereafter for all wells. This tool, which uses electromagnetic flux tomeasure the thickness of the casing, has the advantage of being predictive.It not only indicates the presence of a leak in the well casing, but alsoshows developing weaknesses. The language affords the Director some discretionin using this tool since it is not effective with some casing materials.The majority of comments pertaining to this section of the proposed regulationsopposed the increase in stringency of mechanical integrity testing. Manycommenters were of the opinion that the mechanical integrity testing requirementswere excessive even in the current regulations. They objected particularlyto the casing evaluation tool, maintaining either that it should not berequired in addition to existing MIT requirements or that it should onlybe run if a well were worked over, but in no case every five years. Aspreviously mentioned, the Agency has determined that the predictive abilityof this tool warrants its use, and the propensity for problems to developin a well within a five year time period justifies the frequency of use,particularly with wells injecting hazardous wastes. Such wastes are oftencorrosive. Numerous commenters objected strongly to the prospect of pullingthe tubing and packer at specific intervals in order to assess mechanicalintegrity and suggested that such testing be limited to periods of wellworkovers. They contended that pulling tubing could damage the well. TheAgency disagrees. Mechanical integrity tests such as the temperature logand the noise log are currently required to be run every five years byexisting regulations. These test are most sensitive when run with the tubingpulled; thus, in most cases, the tubing is being pulled every five yearsanyway. The casing tool, which is run with the tubing pulled, is to berun every five years as well and should not significantly contribute tothe ``down time'' of a well as some commenters argue. Moreover, a demonstrationof mechanical integrity is already required after every workover and theregulations state that the Director may schedule the required tests tocoincide with workovers whenever possible. Several commenters also questioned the need for annual RTS testing as theyalso believed it was excessive and that the bottom hole cement never degrades.The Agency believes that an annual RTS test is justified in that it assuresthe operator that the waste stream is being emplaced in the injection zoneand that the bottom hole cement is intact. In addition, use of the RTSdoes not require tubing to be pulled for assessing bottom hole cement and,in some cases, potential leaks in casing, tubing, or packer. Finally, inresponse to one comment, the Agency does not believe that visual inspectionof pulled tubing is a viable alternative for a pressure test or an accurateassessment of the tubing's mechanical integrity. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Ambient Monitoring</ITAG>The ambient monitoring requirements are specified in andSection; 146.13 andapply to owners and operators of all Class I wells, not just those whoinject hazardous waste (see Section (IV) of today's preamble). Section146.68(e) restates these requirements as applicable to Class I hazardouswaste wells in order to facilitate easy reference for the regulated community.The Agency has been investigating methods of ambient monitoring which mightbe useful and will continue to do so. With one exception, there appearsto be no single technique which could provide meaningful data at all sites.The question of what might prove effective at a given site depends on thehydrogeologic setting and the characteristics of the operation.Many commenters urged the deletion of the one technique that the Agencybelieves has the broadest application; the monitoring of the pressure decayor pressure fall-off testing of the injection zone when the well is notinjecting and assessing whether the pressure decay curve tracks predictions.Commenters believed that this was not always effective, and could be inaccurate.Predicted pressure decay curves are made for siting and area of reviewcalculations and are based on hydrogeologic data and operating parameterssuch as injection pressure, fluid density, and volume injected. If thegeology has been accurately portrayed, then the pressure decay should generallymatch predictions. If an unexpected fault or fracture is transmitting fluidit will decline at a faster rate, or conversely, if a boundary conditionis present then the decay curve will be slower than anticipated. The Agencyagrees that no ambient monitoring system is foolproof, and agrees thatfalse readings could occur. Nevertheless, EPA has determined this to bethe most universally applicable monitoring method and has evidence showingit to be accurate in most instances. Therefore, EPA is requiring pressuredecay monitoring of the injection zone annually.There were several commenters who requested a language change in this sectionthat would allow the Director more discretion to conduct ambient monitoring.Other commenters sought to require monitoring in the injection zone, thefirst aquifer above the injection zone, and the lowermost USDW. Still othercommenters indicated that ambient monitoring should be strictly a site-specificrequirement. The Agency agrees that ambient monitoring requirements shouldbe site-specific and has indicated this in the proposed rule (see 52 <T3>FR </T3>32463 and 32464) and today's final rule, and gives the Directordiscretion in determining an acceptable program.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Seismic Monitoring</ITAG>As noted in Section (III)(C)(2) of this preamble, the Agency believes thatseismicity monitoring may be necessary under certain circumstances. A 1987USGS report indicated several key factors in determining when an injectionsite might be the cause of increased seismic activity: (1) a large differencebetween the maximum and minimum compressive stress of an area, (2) thepreexistence of faults or fractures of sufficient size and orientationto facilitate induced seismic activity, (3) relatively high injection pressures,(4) clusters of wells within a relatively small area, and (5) an injectionzone of low permeability. As noted in the USGS report, such conditionsand the resulting earthquakes are rare, and are associated almost exclusivelywith water-flooding operations for the purpose of secondary recovery ofoil, a Class II injection activity. Such Class II activity is often characterizedby large arrays of wells injecting at high pressures into small, confinedreservoirs with low permeabilities. In contrast, waste disposal wells typicallyinject at lower pressures into large, porous aquifers of high permeability.Only one waste well has ever been conclusively linked with seismic activityof any significant amount.EPA believes that the potential for Class I hazardous waste injection toinduce tectonic activity is minimized by a number of requirements beingpromulgated today. Section 146.62(b)(1) prohibits the siting of a ClassI well unless the director has considered regional seismicity in his evaluationof the geologic suitability of the proposed site. Section 146.62(c)(2)(i)requires a confining zone that is laterally continuous and free of transectingfaults or fractures, a requirement which improves the confining zone'sability to prevent increased seismic activity.The Agency can foresee, however, limited circumstances where local seismicmonitoring may be necessary. Seismic stations are neither expensive norburdensome in the time required for their installation and operation. Today'sfinal rule at andSection; 146.68(f) will provide the Director the authorityto require seismic monitoring on a case-by-case basis. The results of anymonitoring required under this section will be reported under andSection;146.69(a)(7).J. Reporting Requirements_Section 146.69Section 146.69 of the proposal detailed the minimum reporting requirementsfor owners and operators of Class I hazardous waste injection wells. Avariety of comments were submitted concerning this section.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Injectivity Index</ITAG>The Agency received several comments on andSection; 146.69(a)(2), which requiredthe owner or operator to report changes in the ratio between injectionpressure and flow rate. In the proposal, the Agency tied this reportingrequirement to the gradients established in andSection; 146.67(f) which areused to trigger automatic alarms or shutoff devices.As several commenters correctly pointed out, the ratio between injectionpressure and flow rate_commonly termed the injectivity index_is best usedto evaluate the long term performance of the injection formation. Thus,tying the requirement to the provisions in andSection; 146.67(f) makes littlesense, and the Agency is changing this requirement in the final rule toreflect the more appropriate application of this requirement.Some commenters suggested that there was no legitimate need to requireoperators to report information on injectivity indexes. They contendedthat the primary purpose was to tell the operator when it may be necessaryto stimulate the formation or conduct other routine maintenance. If theonly result of such observations were to note an orderly increase in pressurewhile flow remained relatively stable, this commenter would be correct.The obvious conclusion to be made from this observation would be that theformation or well screen was becoming clogged_an operational inconvenience,but in most instances not an environmental concern. However, other outcomesmay be observed. For example, a decrease in pressure with flow remainingconstant or increasing, could indicate that the formation is fracturingor that a point of discharge has been reached. Similarly, an increase inflow while pressure remained constant could provide evidence that therewere problems with the formation or the geologic description. Accordingly,the Agency rejects the contention that reporting the injectivity indexhas no legitimate regulatory purpose, and retains the requirement withthe change outlined above.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Shutdown Requirements</ITAG>Section 146.69(a)(3), the new alarm, shutdown, and resulting response requirements,received many comments. Of particular concern to some was discrepancy betweenthis section and andSection; 146.67. In the preamble of the proposal, EPAaddressed false alarms or shutdowns, stating that, ``The Agency is notinterested in receiving a report any time such an event occurs; nor wouldit want the operator to shut in the well under these circumstances.'' Thisposition, while reflected in andSection; 146.67, was not clearly stated inthe reporting requirements at andSection; 146.69(a)(3). The Agency believesthat there is no immediate need to report false alarms or shutdowns. Suchrequirements place unnecessary burden on both operator and regulator. Today'sfinal rule at andSection; 146.69(a)(3) requires immediate Director notificationonly if a loss of mechanical integrity is expected. Other routine occurrenceswould be reported with quarterly reports.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Annular Fluid Loss or Gain</ITAG>Two commenters believed that andSection; 146.69(a)(5) should require thereporting of not only annular fluid lost, if any, but also annular fluidgained, if any. They noted that this would serve a dual purpose: 1) theindication of leaks in the well tubing; and 2) the indication of situationswhere, contrary to the new andSection; 146.67(c) requirements, injectionpressure exceeds annular pressure. The Agency believes that this commenthas validity, and today's promulgation of andSection; 146.69(a)(5) reflectsthis new requirement.K. Information to be Evaluated by the Director_Section 146.70Section 146.70 sets forth the information which must be evaluated by theDirector in authorizing Class I hazardous waste wells. This section essentiallyrestates the information required in andSection; 146.14 of the existing regulations.As such, the Agency believes it is under no obligation to address commentswhich are targeted at the already promulgated standards of andSection; 146.14and simply recodified at andSection; 146.70 for the benefit of the injectioncommunity. Substantive comments relevant to proposed additions or changes,however, are addressed below.One commenter requested that the location of any penetrations of the additionalconfining zone required by andSection; 146.62(d)(1) be submitted to the Directoras a andSection; 146.70 requirement. Another commenter believed that thetime at which closure/post-closure plans are to be submitted should beincluded in andSection; 146.70. The requirement for information in andSection;146.70 on wells which penetrate the confining or injection zone was duplicative,according to one commenter. One group believed that this section omittedthe regional seismicity information required in andSection; 146.62. Priorto the issuance of a permit, one commenter believed that the chemical andphysical characteristics of the fluid to be injected should be evaluatedby the Director. Finally, one commenter believed that the requirement fora program to reduce the volume or quantity and toxicity of the waste producedat a facility should be approved by the Director.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Confining Zone Penetrations</ITAG>One commenter requested that the added second confining stratum providedby andSection; 146.62(d)(1) be deleted, stating that ``it will create farmore problems than it is intended to solve . . .''. This same commenterwent on to suggest that EPA request the location of any penetrations ofthis stratum as well as an evaluation of the potential for further migrationthrough this stratum. The Agency notes that the location of these wellswill be required under andSection; 146.70(a)(2). However, EPA believes thatthis stratum, while adding an additional measure of protection to an injectionsite, does not need to be part of the corrective action plan.One commenter requested the inclusion, in andSection; 146.70, of deadlinesfor the submission of post-closure plans. These plans are required as partof the permitting process. As the commenter noted, these plans must besubmitted with the initial permit application. The Agency sees no needto further regulate this action, as similar plans for plugging and abandonmenthave been handled in a timely manner to this point.Another commenter wanted to delete the phrase ``injection zone'' from andSection;andSection;146.70 (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(15) as well as other areas. He indicatedthat ``The proposed regulations request information on wells which `penetratethe injection zone or the confining zone' * * * All wells which penetratethe confining zone is sufficient. If a well penetrates the injection zoneit will have penetrated the confining zone.'' In requiring the owner oroperator to consider penetrations of the confining zone, the EPA was seekingto address partial penetrations of that zone, not to reopen the existingrequirements relative to injection zones.Therefore, today's promulgation remains unchanged from the proposal, inthis regard.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Regional Seismicity</ITAG>One group noted that the regional seismicity siting requirement of andSection;146.62(b)(1) was not included in andSection; 146.70 as information to beevaluated by the Director. Pursuant to andSection; 146.70(a)(2), the applicantmust show the location of known or suspected faults. Section 146.70(a)(6)requires an analysis of the regional geologic structure, and andSection;146.70(a)(9) requires a formation testing program. Together, these informationrequirements provide the data which allows the owner or operator and theDirector to assure that the requirements of andSection;146.62(b)(1) havebeen met. The issue of seismicity monitoring is addressed in section (III)(I)(6)of the preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Waste Stream Analysis</ITAG>One commenter believed that the Director should evaluate chemical and physicalcharacteristics of the fluid to be injected before issuing a permit. TheAgency believes that the waste stream analysis required by andSection; 146.68(a),combined with the compatibility requirements of andSection;andSection; 146.68(b) and (c), and andSection; 146.70(b)(6) adequately address this issue.The same commenter requested that specific gravity be included as one ofthe waste stream analysis requirements. Specific gravity analysis is animplicit requirement of andSection;146.68(a) and does not need to be codifiedat andSection; 146.70.One commenter felt that the Director should approve the andSection; 146.70(d)(1)certification that the generator of hazardous wastes (at a site which disposesof its own hazardous waste) is implementing a waste minimization programthat is protective of human health and the environment. The Agency notesthat the regulatory language tracks the statutory language in andSection;3005(h), which merely requires a certification. Accordingly, the Agencybelieves that the proposed language is most consistent with the legislativemandate and today promulgates the language as proposed.L. Closure_Section 146.71The Agency reorganized and consolidated existing requirements for closurein the proposed rule. To the extent that these represent a restatementof existing requirements, the Agency is neither seeking comment nor makingany changes. However, EPA has addressed concerns regarding any new requirementsproposed.Three new requirements for closure include: (1) Requiring the owner oroperator to observe and record pressure decay for a time specified by theDirector, (2) requiring the demonstration of mechanical integrity priorto plugging, and (3) clarifying that both the owner or operator as wellas a third party, if different, must certify that the facility was closedin accordance with the closure plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Pressure Decay Data</ITAG>Most of the commenters objected to the proposed provision requiring theowner or operator to observe and record pressure decay over a time periodspecified by the Director. While there was some support for this part ofthe closure plan, several commenters indicated that it was either not essentialor should not be an automatic requirement.The Agency believes that pressure decay data helps define the appropriateperiod of regulatory concern. Specifically, when injection induced pressuresin the formation decay, there is usually no force which will lift the fluidto overlaying strata, and thus there is no environmental threat. In overpressurizedformations, this lifting force may remain but observation of plugged wellsover a thirty year time period provides sufficient assurance that the wellsare plugged in a satisfactory manner, and will continue to provide containmentfor the long term. Accordingly, this requirement will remain as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Cementing and MIT Requirements</ITAG>Several commenters were of the opinion that tests to ensure mechanicalintegrity of the long string casing and cement left in the ground beforeplugging was not necessary and should not be an automatic requirement.The Agency disagrees and further notes that the EPA presently requiresthis demonstration of mechanical integrity in permits in all federally-administeredprograms. Obviously, a well with casing leaks should not be plugged asit can eventually become a source of contamination during the post-closureperiod.One commenter noted that just the placement of cement plugs in casing priorto closure will not prevent fluid movement into USDWs. EPA agrees, andit is for precisely this reason that EPA requires MIT tests prior to plugging.Moveover, the rule specifies that the plugging must be done in a mannerthat will not allow movement of fluids into or between USDWs, and requirescertain actions such as perforating the casing where leaks may develop,or placing cement behind casing prior to setting a plug. The actions aredesigned to assure that the performance standards are met.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Authority to Temporarily Cease Injection</ITAG>One commenter expressed the concern that the Agency's rewarding of thecurrent andSection; 144.28 language created some uncertainty as to when anoperator must seek authorization to temporarily cease injection.It is the intent of this rule that the owner or operator notify the Directorimmediately upon deciding to temporarily cease injection. The Agency didnot intend, however, to require an owner or operator to report well shut-insassociated with routine maintenance or testing activities. Rather, thenotification should be initiated by the decision to take the well out ofservice. In the proposed rule, the Agency intended that the owner or operatorseek the permission of the Director in writing, outlining the technicalsteps being taken to assure continued non-endangerment of USDWs.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. ``Closure''</ITAG>Another commenter questioned the use of ``plugging and abandonment'' inthe proposed regulations whereas RCRA uses ``closure'' in referring tothis procedure.``Plugging and abandonment'' has been a term used in injection well closurefor years. It refers specifically to the closure of a well. The term ``closure'',which is used in RCRA, pertains to the technical procedures appropriateto shutting-in a surface impoundment, landfill, or other surface land disposal,treatment, or generator facility. In using ``plugging and abandonment''versus ``closure'' there is no difference in the protectiveness of thestandard being applied, there is merely a difference in the types of unitsthat the term refers to.One commenter has suggested that the time requirement for closure reportsubmission is unreasonable as the submission of the report may be requiredin as little as 15 days if a quarterly report is also due.The Agency promulgated this requirement on May 11, 1984. It was proposedon September 2, 1983 (see 49 FR 20185 and 48 FR 40098<T3> et seq. </T3>respectively). This rule was litigated and a settlementwas reached. The Agency was not intending to seek comment, nor was it reproposingthe requirement; it was merely recodifying the requirement. Accordingly,EPA sees no reason to amend a requirement which has been in effect fornearly 5 years, and which apparently has caused no great hardship to theregulated community.Finally, some commenters maintained that existing closure requirementswere adequate and that these proposed requirements were excessive. TheAgency would like to note that, in general, today's rule merely restateswhat has been existing practice, either as part of permitting (as in thecase of required mechanical integrity tests) or as part of earlier rulemaking.In the few instances where the Agency has specified additional or morespecific requirements, it has done so primarily to make the closure requirementsfor wells injecting hazardous waste comparable to closure requirementsfor other facilities managing hazardous waste.Several commenters requested clarification on how closure and post closurerequirements would be applied. This is outlined in the section which follows.M. Post-Closure Care and Financial Responsibility for Post-Closure Care_Sections146.72 and 146.73The Agency is now applying post-closure care requirements and associatedfinancial responsibility requirements to hazardous waste injection wells.The Agency believes that even though a properly chosen site should containthe waste indefinitely under natural conditions, future injection activities,oil and gas drilling activities, and other man-induced forces that mayaffect containment must be taken into account. The Agency believes thatthe special problems associated with hazardous waste warrant these newrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Post-closure Care</ITAG>Comments received by the Agency pertaining to post-closure care were generallysupportive of the new requirements. However, several concerns were voicedby commenters on various issues. The regulations, as proposed, stipulated the appropriate time-frames forgroundwater monitoring, retention of well records, and notification toState and local agencies having authority over drilling activities. Therule would also require the owner of the surface or subsurface propertyon or in which a hazardous waste well is located to record certain informationon the deed or other property instrument that would, in perpetuity, providenotice to any subsequent purchaser of the property.A few commenters were unclear as to when the post-closure period ends.As indicated in the proposal, the duration of the post-closure care periodis defined by the length of time the increased pressure from the injectionwell would create the potential to ``lift'' fluids from the injection zone.As the injection pressure decreases to a point where the induced lift fromthe well is dissipated, post-closure requirements would become unnecessary.In response to concerns about the clarity of the rule, the Agency is changingthe manner in which it applies both closure and post-closure care requirements.As promulgated today, the owner or operator would have to submit a planfor the Director's approval which outlined the closure and post-closurecare procedures. The requirements of this plan would survive permit termination.Any changes which might be required in the plan could be made using theprocedures of andSection; 124.5.One commenter suggested that the notation on the deed required by andSection;146.72(c) pertain to any property located over the projected position ofthe waste plume. The Agency does not believe it is necessary, or legallypossible to impose such a requirement. It is generally unnecessary becausewaste in deep formations moves at exceedingly slow rates; thus in manycases it is unlikely that the waste plume will move appreciably over verylong time frames. Moreover, area of review and corrective action requirementswill have addressed any concern associated with abandoned wells. As noted,these requirements are based on the pressure front from the well, whichexceeds the plume by a considerable distance. Thus, there is built-in protectionfor plume travel in these requirements.More importantly, the Agency derives its authority by imposing permit requirementson the regulated entity. No such vehicle exists for surrounding landowners.Therefore, the Agency sees neither the technical necessity nor the legalauthority for such a request. Accordingly, EPA will retain the requirementas proposed.Several commenters noted that required groundwater monitoring should onlybe conducted until pressure in the injection zone decays to the point thatthere is no longer any risk of vertical migration into USDWs. The Agencyagrees and although preamble language in the proposed rule indicated thatsuch monitoring must be conducted until pressure in the injection zonereaches background levels, language in andSection; 146.72 stipulates thatgroundwater monitoring must take place until pressure in the injectionzone decays to the point that the well's cone of influence no longer intersectsthe base of the lowermost USDW. The Director may extend the period of post-closuremonitoring if he determines that the well may still endanger a USDW.One commenter believed that groundwater monitoring should be limited onlyto the lowermost USDW. As noted in the discussion of andSection; 146.68 inthis preamble, the Agency has determined that monitoring requirements mustbe applied in a flexible manner to address site specific concerns. Therefore,EPA continues to believe that the specific monitoring required by the permitis still essential and will continue to be applied if the pressure fromthe injection poses a threat to a USDW.Another commenter indicated that the permittee, not the Director, shouldestimate the proposed cost of the post-closure plan. The Agency clearlystated in the proposal that the permittee is required to provide this costestimate, and further believes that he is in the best position to accuratelydo so. The Director, in reviewing the estimate, will have the opportunityto reject it if he deems it unrealistic.One commenter explained that the original formation pressure may not havebeen obtained for many existing wells and that it is not possible to meetthe andSection; 146.72(a)(3) requirement in these cases. The Agency agrees,but notes that regulations contain enough flexibility to allow existingwells which have not conducted tests verifying background pressures priorto injection to use reasonable estimates based on available data acceptableto the Director.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Financial Responsibility</ITAG>The Agency proposed that the owner or operator should demonstrate and maintainfinancial responsibility for post-closure care. Only a few comments werereceived pertaining to this requirement.Two commenters believed that financial responsibility should be limitedonly to the time period when induced pressures in the injection zone remainsufficiently elevated to pose a risk of vertical migration into USDWs,and not until injection zone pressures decay to background levels. Anothercommenter also felt that the financial responsibility for post-closuregroundwater monitoring should be required only if the permit requires suchmonitoring.The Agency agrees with these commenters and articulated this position inthe proposed rule. Therefore, EPA is not revising this requirement andwill retain it as proposed.One commenter believed that permittees should be responsible for thirdparty liability costs and that they should demonstrate up-front financialresponsibility for cleanup in the event that the waste does contaminatea USDW. The Agency does not believe that in the context of injection wells,such requirements are warranted or justified. Generally, once the formationhas stabilized, there is little or no possibility that waste will movevertically.Finally, one commenter recommended that the Agency use the RCRA post-closurefinancial responsibility instruments. The rule proposed to use the requirements of subpart F of Part 144. A carefulanalysis of this subpart will show that these requirements mirror exactlythe requirements outlined in sections 265 and 264 of the RCRA regulations.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Summary of Today's Rulemaking: Response to Comments; Section 146.13,Ambient Monitoring for all Class I Wells </ITAG>As proposed, andSection; 146.13 addressed the requirements for owners oroperators of <T3>all</T3> Class I wells to develop an ambient monitoring program. Thispart of the rule would also satisfy the mandate of section 1426 of theSafe Drinking Water Act. These requirements differ from other requirementsmade today in that they are not restricted solely to Class I hazardouswaste wells, but rather they are applicable to all Class I wells. At a minimum the proposed rules required a monitoring of the pressure buildupin the injection zone. This would require an annual shut down of the wellfor a period of time sufficient to conduct a valid observation of the pressurefall-off curve. At the Director's discretion, it was proposed that one or more of the followingsite-specific monitoring techniques may also be required in order to preventthe contamination of USDWs: 1. Continuous monitoring for pressure changes in the first aquifer overlyingthe confining zone; 2. The use of indirect, geophysical techniques to determine pertinent characteristicsof the formation and injected fluids;3. Periodic monitoring of the ground water quality in the lowermost USDW;or 4. Any other technique which the Director deems necessary to protect USDWs.Further details concerning ambient monitoring and the response to severalcomments can be found in the preamble language in Testing and Monitoring,andSection; 146.68(e) of today's rule.As many commenters indicated, the question of what might prove effectiveat a given site depends on the hydrogeologic setting and the characteristicsof the operation. Many commenters urged the deletion of the one techniquethat the Agency believes has the best application; the monitoring of apressure decay or pressure fall-off testing of the injection zone whenthe well is not injecting, and assessing whether the decay curve trackspredictions. Commenters believed that this was not always effective, wastoo costly, and could be inaccurate. Although some of these concerns maybe valid, EPA has determined that this is the most universally applicablemonitoring technique and has evidence showing it to be accurate in mostcases. Therefore, the Agency will require pressure decay monitoring ofthe injection zone annually. Some commenters were of the opinion that ambient monitoring was too costlyand should be optional. The Agency does not believe that this type of monitoringis particularly expensive when compared to the information received. Stillother commenters believed that certain site-specific monitoring techniquesthat may also be required by the Director were either inappropriate orflawed in preventing the contamination of USDWs. In response, the Agencyagrees that ambient monitoring requirements should be site-specific andhas indicated this in the proposal and today's rule, and has thereforegiven the Director discretion in determining an acceptable ambient monitoringprogram. <ITAG tagnum="85">V. Summary of Today's Rulemaking: Response to Comments; Amendmentsto Parts 124 and 144</ITAG>A. Part 124The Agency proposed to amend Part 124 to require that State and local agencieswhich regulate oil and gas activities, and state agencies that regulatemineral exploration be notified, by operators, of permit activities forall Class I wells. This practice could help agencies coordinate their programsand apply specific requirements when appropriate. One commenter supportedthis idea, but felt it should work both ways, i.e., that State and localagencies regulating oil, gas, or mineral exploration and recovery shouldgive notice of their permit activities to the agency regulating Class Ifacilities. The EPA believes that such coordination would be beneficialto all involved parties, but also realizes that its authority to requiresuch notification from State regulatory bodies is questionable. The EPAintends to take all necessary measures to insure that federal, State, andlocal regulatory bodies are notified of all federally implemented injectionactivities. Two commenters believed that the new requirement to notify agencies ofpermit activities was burdensome. The Agency believes that such a requirementis not unreasonable in the context of other andSection; 124.10 notificationrequirements. On the contrary, EPA believes that such notification is appropriate,given the special concerns associated with hazardous waste injection. B. Part 144The proposal contained two amendments to Part 144. Section 144.31(h) wasproposed to assure that plugging and abandonment, closure, and post-closurerequirements are met. As outlined in Section (III)(M)(1) of this preamble,the Agency is changing the approach. Under the new approach, the plan willbe submitted as part of a permit application or modification, but willsurvive the permit as a directly enforceable requirement until the endof the post closure period. The Agency is also amending andSection; 144.52(a) (``Establishing PermitRequirements'') to ensure that all Subpart G requirements can be administeredthrough a permit, consistent with the framework established for the UICprogram. Amendments to andSection;andSection; 144.39 (a) and (b) would broaden the reasonsfor which permits may be modified or revoked and reissued. Specifically,this section would require permit modification either when regulationschange, or when the waste is changed or reclassified. The intent of thischange is to give the Director the discretion to revise or reissue a permitwhen the waste becomes or is determined to be hazardous as defined in Part261.Many commenters objected to the removal of the ``shield'' provision. Thisprovision currently prevents the modification, revocation, or reissuanceof a permit to require compliance with new regulations unless the permitteerequests or agrees to such action. They argue that the Part 146 requirementshave, to this point, proved protective of human health and the environment.The HSWA Amendments impose new, higher levels of concern on hazardous wastefacilities. Recently proposed rules to amend the regulations governingthe disposal of hazardous waste in surface facilities would broaden theDirector's authority to revise permits when conditions warrant such revisions,and the Agency believes that rules applicable to injection of hazardouswastes should mirror this new approach. A number of commenters believed that Part 144 should contain a sectionthat would grant interim permit status to wells with approved petitions.It is their opinion that such approved petitions are similar in kind toa valid permit, and that administrative procedures associated with therepermitting process may delay the continued operation or startup of theirfacilities.In response, EPA would like to note that an approved permit and an approvedpetition are similar in certain aspects, but they do not address identicalconcerns. The Part 148 petition process does not contain provisions pertainingto the movement of formation fluids. The SDWA, however, requires the Agencyto regulate endangerment of USDWs, regardless of whether that endangermentwere to occur from injected wastes or formation fluids. The movement offormation fluids is regulated through an approved permit.Review and approval of both a permit and a petition are required to insureprotection of human health and the environment, and non-endangerment ofUSDWs. It should be noted that the Agency will attempt to run concurrentpetition and permit review processes whenever possible.One commenter addressed andSection; 144.36 and the duration of permits. Nochange was proposed to this section, and consequently we are not addressingit.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact AnalysisExecutive Order 12291 requires EPA to assess the effect of contemplatedAgency actions during the development of regulations. Such an assessmentconsists of a quantification of the potential benefits and costs of therule, as well as a description of any benefical or adverse effects thatcannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, Executive Order 12291requires that regulatory agencies prepare an analysis of the regulatoryimpact of major rules. Major rules are defined as those likely to resultin:1. An annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more; or2. A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries;or3. Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,innovation or international trade.At the request of the Office of Management and Budget, the Agency has reexaminedthis final rule in light of the changes made since the proposal, and theireffect on its status as a minor rule. This economic analysis indicatesthat the changes made will have no appreciable effect on the compliancecosts estimated for the rule proposed on August 27, 1987. Total annualizedcompliance costs of the regulation are estimated to total $63 million.Total capital costs are estimated to total $15 million and one-time petitioncosts are estimated to be $3 million. These costs indicate that the ruledoes not constitute a major rule under Executive Order 12291 and EPA hasnot prepared a formal regulatory impact analysis of today's promulgation.The Agency has, however, prepared an assessment of the cost and potentialeconomic effects of the rule.B. Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>whenever an agency is required to publish a notice ofrulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make availablefor public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes theeffect of the rule on small entities (<T3>i.e., </T3>small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however, if the agency'sadministrator certifies that the rule will not have significant economiceffect on a substantial number of small entities.Owners and operators of hazardous waste injection wells are generally majorchemical, petrochemical and other manufacturing companies. The Agency isnot aware of any small entities that would be directly affected by thisrule. Part 148.1(c)(3) of this rule exempts any small quantity generator,as defined in andSection; 261.5, from the underground injection prohibitionsoutlined in this rule. The Administrator certifies that this rule willnot have significant economic effects on a substantial number of smallbusinesses. As a result of this finding EPA has not prepared a formal RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements in this rule have been approvedby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act, </T3>44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>The Agency has amended the Information Collection Requestdocument to address concerns raised by OMB. A copy of this document (ICRNo. 0370) may be obtained from Eric Strassler, Information Policy Branch;EPA; 401 M St., SW. (PM-223); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202)382-2738.D. Administrative Procedures ActAs a petition may grant a variance from a prohibition, EPA may make Part148 immediately effective pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act(see 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1)). The Agency is choosing to do so as the statutorydeadline establishing prohibitions is effective August 8, 1988. Exceptto the extent incorporated in Part 148, the amendments to Parts 124, 144and 146 become effective 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="74">VII.
