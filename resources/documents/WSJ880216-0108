The buyer, Ft. Wayne, Ind.-based Diversified Financial Planners Inc., agreed to acquire about 2,500 loans taken from 20 separate bank failures, paying $21.1 million for loans with an original face value of about $70 million, the FDIC said.    The unusual move by the FDIC, which insures bank deposits of as much as $100,000 and inherits the assets of failed banks, comes as the agency struggles to meet ambitious goals it set to keep its liquidation assets from mushrooming, despite the continuing high level of bank failures.    For 1987, the FDIC disclosed last week, its assets under liquidation rose by about $100 million to $11 billion. The agency said collections rose 38% from the 1986 level to $2.42 billion, but that it didn't achieve the 50% growth in collections it earlier projected.    As previously reported, the agency recently decided to explore the bulk sale of $1.8 billion in loans it took in the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois Corp., rather than continue liquidating those loans. And an FDIC spokesman said the agency also is exploring the sale of its entire Omaha, Neb., liquidation portfolio.    The FDIC has increasingly sought to dispose of failed bank loans quickly, taking bigger up-front losses in the process, rather than tie up the agency's cash.    The Missouri portfolio, from bank failures dating back to 1985, contains consumer, commercial and agricultural loans, as well as some repossessed real estate. A spokesman for Diversified said the company paid prices ranging from almost nothing to 85 cents on the dollar for the individual loans. The spokesman said a bank, which he wouldn't name, had agreed to help Diversified finance the purchase. The company has purchased FDIC and other troubled assets before, he said, but never on this large a scale.    By selling now, the FDIC said, it will realize about 80% of the current value of what it had expected to collect over a period of years. What's more, the agency won't have the operating costs of liquidation; it has about 125 temporary employees in Missouri. Overall, the FDIC's liquidation division employs about 4,400. </TEXT></DOC>
