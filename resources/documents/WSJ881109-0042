The computer-aided design concern said HHB stockholders received 1.5 Cadnetix shares for each HHB share owned, or a total of 7.2 million new shares. Cadnetix now has about 21 million shares outstanding.    As previously reported, Daisy Systems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., has offered $8.375 for each of Cadnetix's shares outstanding, including the new shares issued in the HHB purchase. Cadnetix has rebuffed the bid and said it is considering other alternatives.    A Daisy spokesman said its offer took into account Cadnetix's acquisition of HHB. &quot;This really doesn't change our offer at all,&quot; the spokesman said.    Cadnetix, based in Boulder, Colo., had net income of $6.4 million, or 46 cents a share, on revenue of $62 million in the fiscal year ended June 30. HHB, of Mahwah, N.J., had net income of $1.4 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $19.7 million for the same period.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cadnetix closed at $8.125, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
