You fail to recognize that U.S. nuclear-energyplants have reduced dependence on foreign oil since the 1973oil embargo by 4.3 billion barrels and continue to cut ouruse of foreign oil by 740,000 barrels every day. This is justabout the amount we had been importing from Iraq and Kuwaitbefore Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.   Construction of nuclear-energy plants to supplyelectricity was a major part of this nation's efforts to usedomestic sources of energy to avoid its increasing dependenceon foreign oil after the 1973 embargo. We've forgotten thatlesson and, apparently, must relearn it.</LP><TEXT>   Harold B. Finger   Washington   ---   You dismiss renewable energy as &quot;far-fetched alternatives&quot;that aren't economically viable. One need only look atCalifornia's use of renewable energy resources last year tosee that these statements are completely untrue. In 1989,18.2% of all electrical energy used in California came fromrenewable energy resources. As one of those renewabletechnologies, we believe that solar electric generatingsystems (SEGS) are neither far-fetched nor uneconomical. As amatter of fact, our newest 80-megawatt SEGS plant iscurrently providing Southern California Edison electricity ata cost of eight cents a kilowatt hour. This cost is cheaperthan nuclear and almost competitive with oil and gas.   James C. Bazor   Chief Operating Officer   Luz International Limited   Los Angeles</TEXT></DOC>
