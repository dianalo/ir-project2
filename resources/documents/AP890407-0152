PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A long-awaited draft law reforming Sovietpractices on religion removes a Stalin-era prohibition on groupreligious education and opens limited alternatives to bearing armsin military service.   New legislation that has been in the works for at least 18months will reeplace a directive put into force 60 years ago at theheight of the Soviet Union's anti-religious fervor and for thefirst time give churches legal standing to fight official abuse, anofficial said Friday.   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the as-yet uncompleteddraft legislation from religious dissidents. TatyanaBelokovylskaya, chief of legal affairs for the government's Councilon Religious Affairs, said it was an authentic document that hadbeen presented to church authorities for discussion.   ``This is a big step forward in the democratization of relationsbetween the church and state,'' she said.   Believers have been persecuted for years despite laws thatguarantee freedom of worship, but Ms. Belokovylskaya said the newlegislation will give them a chance to fight back.   ``In order to protect themselves, religious organizations haveto have legal standing. They are not only presented with rights,but the ability to protect themselves,'' she said.   But dissidents say it doesn't go far enough to protect them frompersecution, or to separate the government from the CommunistParty's official atheism. Dissidents also have said they lack faithin church leaders who have cooperated with the government.   Officials are completing work on the document a year afterPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Patriarch Pimen, head of theRussian Orthodox church. That meeting, the first of its kind in 40years, symbolized Gorbachev's effort to ease restrictions onbelievers and draw them into his reform process.   As a sign of authorities' more liberal attitude toward religion,the Moscow News reported that 1,610 new groups of believers wereregistered in 1988 compared with 104 in the previous year. It saidauthorities handed back 937 religious buildings that had been takenaway and granted permission for 143 new churches and mosques to bebuilt.   When finished, the draft law will be presented to the SovietUnion's new Congress of People's Deputies parliament.   Ms. Belokovylskaya said changes are still being made in the law,but several key points have been decided. They include provisionsallowing for alternatives to bearing arms, group religiouseducation, and establishing the legal standing of churches. Inaddition, Ms. Belokovylskaya said a more recent draft of the lawpermits religious organizations to engage in charitable work.   Under the Stalin-era directive that still serves as the modelfor laws in each of the 15 Soviet republics, believers may notorganize any charitable activity or church groups. They faceprosecution for obtaining group religious training for themselvesor their children.   Young men who refuse compulsory military service face terms inprison camps. All religious groups must be registered with thegovernment, and only can be approved if they consist of 20 or moreadults.   ``Citizens may teach and learn religion in a private manner asan individual, as well as together with others, including at homeand through a religious society,'' the draft law said.   Ms. Belokovylskaya said that ``absolutely'' allowed for thegroup religious training of children.   Religious organizations also will be allowed to use the officialmedia, she said.   Ms. Belokovylskaya said alternative service permitted by courtson an individual basis was a controversial point, but ``all thesame, we are reducing the size of our military. This idea has itstime and place.''   Types of alternative service have not yet been established, butmay be based on the experience of countries such as Hungary andEast Germany that provide for work in military hospitals orconstruction where believers would not be required to take up arms,she said.   Ms. Belokovylskaya said officials still are considering ways toprovide the legal protection afforded by official registrationwhile meeting the demands by some evangelical Christians that theynot be required to register.   Dissidents who have rejected the proposed reforms asinsufficient wrote their own law at a three-day conference inMoscow at the end of March.   Former political prisoner Alexander Ogorodnikov complained thedraft law provides more freedom but leaves final decisions in thehands of Soviet administrators. ``We know what kind ofadministration that is,'' he said.   Dissidents also included a section of law separating thegovernment and schools not only from religion, but from atheism aswell.   Believers long have complained the Soviet Union's officialatheism, established in the constitution as a right to conduct``atheist propaganda,'' begins with training as early askindergarten.</TEXT></DOC>
