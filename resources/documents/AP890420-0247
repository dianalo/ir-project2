The news sent already-strong oil prices even higher. The spotprice for Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crudeoil, rose to $21.40 a barrel in London Thursday afternoon, from$21.05 late Wednesday.   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson said in reponse to questions inthe House of Commons that two energy department inspectors werestill at Shell U.K. Exploration and Production's Cormorant Alphaplatfrom, where a gas leak and explosion on Tuesday halted Brentoil field production.   There were no injuries, said the operator, a unit of the RoyalDutch-Shell Group of Companies.   The Cormorant Alpha platform lies about 100 miles northeast ofLerwick in Shetland.   The Cabinet minister, who said he had spoken to the inspectorsan hour previously, said he couldn't say when the system wouldreopen ``until they've completed their assessment.'' He added thathe couldn't estimate how long that assessment would take.   But the minister suggested in further comments that theCormorant platform wouldn't be reopened for three to four weeks.   ``Reports of this time closure have been widely mentioned,'' theminister said.   Parkinson said that the closure of the Cormorant Alpha platformand other platforms in the Brent field which routed their crudethrough Cormorant to the Sullom Voe terminal has taken about400,000 barrels a day, or 17 percent of total North Sea production,out of the market.   Other closures in the North Sea already have curtailedproduction.   He said there hadn't been any structural damage to CormorantAlpha.   Shell has said that engineers might be able to divert Brentfield production so that it bypasses Cormorant Alpha.   Parkinson said, ``Our best estimate of the effect, assuming afour-to-six weeks' closure, is 800 million pounds ($1.4 billion) onthe current account this year.''   Britain, a big oil exporter, produces an average 2 millionbarrels a day.   Parkinson said his director of safety inspection wouldn't allowthe Brent production and transportation system reopened until allsafety precautions were taken.   A fire on the Occidental Petroleum Corp.-operated Piper Alphaplatform in the North Sea last summer killed 167 men.</TEXT></DOC>
