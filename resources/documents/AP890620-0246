(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three union leaders jailed for encouragingstrikers to block mine entrances were freed today after promising toobey a judge's restrictions, raising hopes for an end to a wildcatwalkout by 27,000 miners in nine states.   The United Mine Workers officials said after leaving the judge'schambers that they can win their dispute against the Pittston CoalGroup in spite of the judge's ban on tactics such as sit-downdemonstrations to block coal trucks.   ``This strike is still building,'' said strike coordinator MartyHudson as a cheering crowd of about 35 striking miners and familymembers waited outside the court of U.S. District Judge GlenWilliams. He and his two colleagues had been released from a Roanokejail Monday night pending today's hearing.   ``There are no white flags on these hands. We're going to winthis strike. We're not turning back,'' Hudson said.   Hudson said he and the other jailed leaders decided to purgethemselves of a contempt charge and promised to obey the orderbecause striking miners told them they were needed on picket lines.He also said the three were needed to testify for UMW supporters whowere arrested in sit-down demonstrations.   Also released were Jackie Stump, president of UMW's southwestVirginia district, and C.A. Phillips, a UMW internationalrepresentative.   The judge's June 5 decision to jail the three without bond untilthey promised to end civil disobedience against Pittston has been arallying point for wildcat sympathy strikes by some 27,000 UMWmembers in nine states.   Roger Caldwell, a UMW field representative in West Virginia, saidthe unauthorized strikes probably will continue as miners turn theirattention to the $3 million in fines levied against the UMW by aVirginia state judge.   ``What good is it to have them out of jail if they're going breakthe union anyway?'' Caldwell asked.   The three leaders will be kept away from picket sites and insteadbe used at meetings in other communities, said Cecil Roberts, UMWvice president.   ``We are interested in satisfying him (the judge) that thesepeople will obey his order,'' Roberts said.   Williams held the three on contempt of court for violating hisorder restricting strike activity. The sit-down demonstrations, inwhich more than 2,000 striking miners and supporters have beenarrested, have since ended.   Hours before the three were released from jail, the wildcatstrike ended in Virginia when 790 UMW employees returned to theirjobs. But 5,000 more miners in Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and Ohiojoined the walkout.   That brought to more than 27,000 the number of miners on strikeagainst coal operators in nine states, not including the 1,800picketing Pittston in a contract dispute. The UMW has about 80,000active members nationwide.   Bobby R. Brown, president of Consolidation Coal Co. inPittsburgh, joined other coal company officials in criticizing thewildcatters. ``I do not know what the issues are except sympathy,''he said. ``I think it's a very serious mistake by the UMW.''   Brown also said he feared the union members' actions would hurtexports.   ``I think now we're going to have to live through being a notvery stable supplier because of the wildcat strikes,'' he said.   About 1,600 UMW employees walked off their Pittston jobs inVirginia and West Virginia on April 5 after working more than 14months without a contract. The strike spread to Pittston's Kentuckyoperations Monday, idling 200 more UMW members.   Pittston has refused to sign a nationwide contract and wants itsown pact that would include mandatory overtime, Sunday work and acut in pension benefits. The UMW insists that the company sign acontract requiring Pittston to pay into the national pension fundand keep mines closed on Sundays.   The wildcat strikers on Monday numbered 16,000 in West Virginia;3,900 in Alabama; 2,500 in Pennsylvania; 1,750 in Indiana; 1,270 inKentucky; 1,100 in Ohio; 650 in Illinois; 338 in Missouri, and 200in Tennessee.</TEXT></DOC>
