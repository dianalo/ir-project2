The Arab League's latest truce, the fifth in more than twomonths of fighting, was tested by minor shelling fired from Syrianpositions at the coast of the Christian enclave north of the city.   A police spokesman said the shelling was ``a clear message thatthe Syrians would not allow any ship carrying Iraqi weapons to dockat ports in the enclave.''   Syria accuses Iraq of aiding the Christian forces.   The police spokesman said Syrian gunners fired six rockets atthe Christian coastline north of Beirut. The 122mm Grad rockets``exploded in several locations of the coast, causing damage, butno casualties,'' said the spokesman.   In the fighting since March 8, police said 359 people have beenkilled and 1,393 wounded.   Rockets also fell on the coastline, but there were no immediatereports of casualties or damage.   The 20,000-member Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aoundid not respond to the Syrian fire, the spokesman said.   Aside from the firing, the cease-fire that went into effectThursday was ``holding along all frontlines. No violations werereported,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymityunder standing rules.   The four-man Arab League delegation headed by Lakhdar Ibrahimiheld talks with Moslem and Christian leaders in west and eastBeirut to ``facilitate and expand the cease-fire accord,'' he toldreporters.   Ibrahimi said his talks aim at ``stabilizing the securitysituation to allow the Arab committee to deal with Lebanon'spolitical problems.''   He would not answer reporters' questions.   Sources in the Cabinet of acting Premier Salim Hoss, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said the Arab envoys were discussingconflicting demands about the deployment of the 321-member Arabobserver force organized by the Arab League.   There are ``two main deployment plans, one proposed by Syria andthe other by Aoun,'' said one source. ``They are concentratingtheir talks on a compromise plan accepted by all the parties.''   The Syrian-proposed plan, the source said, calls for deployingthe observers at ports in the Christian enclave to try to preventships carrying Iraqi weapons and ammunition from re-supplyingAoun's forces.   Aoun, in a counterproposal, called for their deployment alongLebanon's extensive border with Syria and at the Syrian-controlledBeirut airport in the city's Moslem sector ``to monitor theSyrians' moves,'' the source said.   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, supports Aoun's declared ``war ofliberation'' to drive Syria's 40,000 troops out of Lebanon.   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, represents Arab League Secretary GeneralChedli Klibi. He was accompanied by Kuwaiti diplomat Abdel-AzizJassem and the observer group's military commanders.   The team met in west Beirut separately with Hoss, who heads theMoslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, and Shiite Moslemleader Nabih Berri.   The team crossed to Christian east Beirut for separate talkswith Aoun, who heads the Christian cabinet, and the Lebanese Frontalliance of right-wing Christian political parties.   The latest fighting erupted March 8, two days after Aoun ordereda blockade of three illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militiassouth of Beirut.   Militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's ProgressiveSocialist Party retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mileChristian enclave northeast of Beirut.   Syrian gunners later joined in the shelling.   The United States and the Soviet Union, in a joint statement,they were prepared to help find a settlement.   The statement, issued at the end of U.S. Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III's visit to Moscow, said the superpowers ``areprepared to provide good offices so that, jointly with otherstates, they may promote a political solution to the problem ofLebanon, taking into consideration the interests of all sides.''</TEXT></DOC>
