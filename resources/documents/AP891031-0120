But as hundreds of he townspeople waved ``V'' signs and sang,military authorities said they had succeeded in breaking therevolt, seizing the equivalent of more than $1.5 million to make upfor unpaid taxes.   ``We are always collecting taxes. We have always collectedtaxes. We are the authorities,'' said Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, headof the West Bank military government.   Hanan Banura, a 25-year-old mother of two whose husband is injail for refusing to pay taxes, said the town's defiancestrengthened the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising againstoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``We won something here,'' she said. ``We did what we wanted todo, not what they wanted.''   The bulldozers that pushed away the earthen mound blocking offthe Christian Arab town of 10,000 people ended Beit Sahour'sunlikely role as a symbol of the revolt against occupation.   It is a town of large, prosperous-looking homes of sun-bleachedstone located down steep, winding roads from Bethlehem. Untilrecently its middle-class residents were derided as ``richrevolutionaries'' by poor Palestinians in refugee camps who foughtIsraelis with stones and firebombs.   Of the more than 600 Palestinians killed in clashes withsoldiers or civilians in the uprising, only one died in Beit Sahour.   But Beit Sahour, known mostly for the fields where shepherdsfirst learned of Christ's birth, kept up the boycott of Israelitaxes ordered by the PLO-backed leaders of the uprising long aftermost other Palestinians gave in to Israeli pressure.   Much to Israel's consternation, the tax revolt has gotten asmuch publicity as the uprising's persistent violence. Journalistswho sneaked into Beit Sahour described refrigerators, rugs, cars,televisions and all manner of goods being hauled away.   On one side, townspeople complained against ``taxation withoutrepresentation.'' On the other, Israel claimed it was seizing goodsonly to collect taxes to support schools, roads and other services.   Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem who hasresearched the West Bank for 10 years, alleged in 1986 that Israelcollected more taxes than it spent on the territory since it andthe Gaza Strip were captured in the 1967 Middle East war.   The army magazine Bamahane said in its most recent edition thatpeople in Beit Sahour owed about $500,000 in taxes, but the extragoods were seized to cover ``transport and storage.''   On Tuesday, townspeople ranging from youths honking car horns tobusinessmen claimed their revolt delivered a rebuke to Israel.   Chakib Awad, owner of a factory that makes bakery machinery andmetal statues of Christ for sale to tourists, said Beit Sahourshowed it had a role in the revolt.   ``At my age, I don't throw firebombs,'' he said. ``I am not aterrorist.''   Awad showed a list of 18 machines he said had been seized fromhis factory, which he valued at $69,250.   He said that before the uprising, he had paid taxes to Israeliauthorities or the Jordanian government when it controlled the WestBank. But he added he no longer wanted to pay occupiers.   ``I am not a Jordanian any more. I am not an Israeli,'' he said.``I am a Palestinian. I have to pay taxes to a Palestinian state.''   Israeli officials said that debts from 398 major tax debtorswere ``handled'' in the six-week campaign and that confiscatedgoods included 33 cars as well as bank accounts and cash.   A statement by military officials said soldiers also arrested 40tax debtors. Thirty-five have been indicted.   ``We have realized what we wanted to accomplish and more,'' saidErez.   Not all Israelis agreed. Seven left-wing Israeli legislators whovisited the town Monday _ on condition they not take journalistsalong _ said Tuesday the tax campaign was a failure.   Lova Eliav, a Labor Party legislator, described the campaignagainst Beit Sahour as ``a futile, foolish exercise. ... The armyhas turned elite soldiers into tax collectors.''   Legislator Dedi Zucker of the Citizens' Rights Movement saidwhat happened in Beit Sahour was ``a fight over who is a sovereign... and it has not been proven Israel is a real sovereign in BeitSahour.''</TEXT></DOC>
