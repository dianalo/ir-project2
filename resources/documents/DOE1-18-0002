Importedoil and natural gas are the principal fuels used. The only coal usedwithin state borders is a small amount of coking coal. Total energy demandin California fell 1.5% in 1986 in part due to a mild winter that ledto decreased heating requirements in the residential, commercial, andto a lesser extent, the industrial end-use sectors. The decline in industrialenergy consumption paralleled the decline registered in the US as a whole,but was more marked in California. As industrial activity was robustby all criteria, the decline relates to increased efficiencies as wellas the increasing importance of service industries and other less energyintensive components in the sector. Consumption of fuels for transportationincreased to an all time high; the growth in 1986 exceeded the estimatedpopulation increase over the same period. Cogeneration and self-generationof electrical power increased substantially and continued to displaceutility generated power which has posed problems for the utilities andregulatory agencies alike. Expected growth in both sources, as well asin alternative sources of power in the state, such as geothermal andwindpower, promises to produce an electrical capacity suplus within afew years. 27 refs., 4 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
