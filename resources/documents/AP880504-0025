Africa</HEAD><BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Legislation to end all U.S. investment inwhite-dominated South Africa and impose a near-total embargo onexports and imports is heading for a partisan battle on the Housefloor.   The House Foreign Affairs Committee gave its approval to thedisinvestment bill on Tuesday, voting 27-14. Action by the fullHouse is expected to be scheduled soon.   The Democratic-controlled committee acted after voting downrepeated attempts by Republicans to dilute the measure's impact.   The panel also approved by voice vote separate legislationurging and authorizing President Reagan to impose economicsanctions against the government of Ethiopia for alleged widespreadand serious human rights violations, including the diversion ofinternational starvation relief to the Ethiopian armed forces.   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the panel's Africanaffairs subcommittee, said ending U.S. investment in South Africaand imposing a two-way embargo on most trade will not cause SouthAfrica's white minority government to end its apartheid policies ofracial separation.   ``Sanctions will not of themselves bring down apartheid,'' Wolpesaid.   But he said they will raise the cost to the white minorityregime of maintaining South Africa as ``one vast slave plantation''in which whites profit from the exploitation of blacks.   ``This bill is the only non-violent means at our disposal, theleast costly means of averting a terrible tragedy in SouthAfrica,'' Wolpe said.   Opponents of the legislation said it will hurt the black SouthAfricans it is designed to help. They predicted the loss ofthousands of jobs not only for blacks in South Africa but also forAmericans whose companies are hurt by the impact of the sanctions.   ``This is not a policy, this is scorched earth,'' said Rep. DanBurton, R-Ind., contending the bill will cost 2 million jobs forSouth African blacks by the year 2000.   Supporters of sanctions acknowleged that some American jobsmight well be lost but said that is of secondary importance in thebattle against apartheid.   ``It may well be necessary in the pursuit of vital Americaninterests for us to be prepared to pay a certain price ourselveshere at home,'' said Rep. Steven Solarz, D-N.Y., adding that thebill has been endorsed by major U.S. labor organizations includingthe AFL-CIO.   Speaking against an amendment to enable the president to waivethe sanctions law if it is hurting the U.S. economy, Solarz saidsuch a loophole would tell black South Africans, ``We are onlyprepared to help you to the extent that it doesn't hurt us.''   The bill would replace a sanctions law enacted over PresidentReagan's veto in 1986. Burton contended that the 1986 law hasfailed to put a dent in apartheid.   ``I sympathize with the desperation,'' he said of the newlegislation. ``But acts of desperation generally hurt innocentbystanders, and this one does it in spades.''   The 1986 law barred new U.S. investment in South Africa andestablished several specific trade sanctions. But it has permittedU.S. companies to stay in South Africa if they so choose.   The new bill would forbid any American citizen from holding anyinvestment in South Africa, a requirement that would force theclosing or sale of all U.S.-owned companies in the country.   It would would bar all imports from South Africa except forcertain strategic minerals.   It would prohibit all exports to South Africa except forpublications, articles intended to relieve human suffering, U.S.economic assistance, and private assistance intended to promotehuman rights, health, welfare, religious and educational activities.   An amendment adopted during the committee debate also providedan exemption for food, a step supporters said would make thelegislation more attractive to House members representing farmregions.   Prospects for the legislation are considered good in the House,where majority Democrats see the sanctions issue as a politicalplus for them in this election year. However, its prospects in theSenate are less clear, in part because the legislation lackssupport of moderate Republicans who were the key to passing themore limited sanctions bill two years ago.   The sanctions would go into effect six months after the bill wasenacted into law.   The legislation also:   _Prohibits U.S. involvement in the South African petroleumindustry.   _Bars all U.S. nuclear assistance to South Africa.   _Directs the president to pursue international agreements aimedat dismantling apartheid.   _Requires the president to impose penalties on foreign nationalsseeking to take significant commercial advantage of the U.S.sanctions.   _Adds to the existing conditions for lifting sanctions arequirement that South Africa implement United Nations resolutionsfor the independence of the territory of South West Africa known asNamibia.   _Authorizes $40 million for economic assistance fordisadvantaged South Africans.</TEXT></DOC>
