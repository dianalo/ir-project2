The committee also is expected to avoid wholesaletermination of new multibillion-dollar weapons, keeping alivesuch controversial programs as the Air Force's B-2 Stealthbomber, the Navy's expensive Seawolf submarine, and a groupof sophisticated aircraft still under development.</LP><TEXT>   Final details, however, won't be worked out until thebudget summit between Congress and the White House winds downand the House Armed Services Committee has had its chance tochop away at uniformed strength and cherished Pentagonweapons plans in the next few weeks.   Meeting behind closed doors, members of the Senate panelare expected to approve about $289 billion inmilitary-spending authority for the fiscal year starting Oct.1. That level, $18 billion less than President Bush's Januarybudget request, is the one advocated by Chairman Sam Nunn(D., Ga.), who is one of the leading lawmakers seekinggradual cuts.   But in an unusual procedure, the committee is expected tomap out at least $4 billion more in contingency cuts --including the elimination of an additional 30,000 or sotroops next year -- reflecting the likelihood that greaterPentagon sacrifices will be part of any summit agreement withthe White House.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cut short an official tripto Europe to attend another meeting of the budget summiteershere today, although spokesmen said Mr. Cheneny didn't haveany plans to submit revised spending figures to the group.   The committee's action will be the opening salvo of whatis certain to be an emotional and drawn-out congressionaldebate pitting Sen. Nunn and other Pentagon supportersagainst an increasingly powerful bipartisan coalitiondetermined to gut some of the military's most expensiveresearch and procurement programs. Depending on how thebudget summit ends, fights over many of the cuts may have tobe repeated on the Senate floor.   By voting out a bill before the budget summit concludes,Sen. Nunn and his allies apparently hope to take theinitiative away from lawmakers who advocate deeper cuts. Thestrategy, according to Senate aides and defense officials, isto draw a line in the sand and demonstrate how much pain eventhe committee's cuts would cause the Pentagon.   Still, the Senate bill is bound to be more favorable tothe Pentagon than the measure taking shape on the other sideof Capitol Hill. House Democratic leaders, for example,advocate substantially deeper cuts that Secretary Cheneycomplains could force more than 700,000 active-duty troopsand some 500,000 reserves off the Pentagon's payroll by thelate 1990s. Currently, there are about 2.1 millionactive-duty troops and 1.1 million reserves.   In a series of speeches earlier this year, Sen. Nunnemphasized that he would strongly oppose such hefty personnelcuts, especially in reserve units that are less expensive tomaintain than active-duty forces and often are viewed asimportant parts of the local community. &quot;The presumption,&quot;Sen. Nunn argued in one of the speeches, should be totransfer &quot;as much capability into reserve {forces} aspossible in this new era.&quot;   Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), chairman of the manpowersubcommittee, also has come out strongly against cutbacks inthe National Guard and Army reserves, according to Pentagonofficials and committee aides. As a result, these officialssaid, the Senate panel is expected to approve only marginalreductions in 1991 reserve strength. Pentagon officials arestruggling to finish a comprehensive study on theresponsibilities reserve units should assume, but thecongressionally mandated report won't be available until wellafter both committees finish work on Pentagon spending bills.   In weapons-buying accounts, the Senate panel is expectedto reject administration proposals to aggressively developboth the multiple-warhead MX missile and the smallerMidgetman missile. The committee also is expected to trimrequests to build a new generation of attack helicopters andcombat vehicles for the Army, scale back purchases ofguided-missile destroyers by the Navy, and cap researchfunding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposedspace-based anti-missile system, at less than $3.5 billion.   Mr. Cheney still hasn't announced the results of his ownreassessment of SDI, the Army's LH helicopter program and theNavy's overall submarine and ship-buying plans.</TEXT></DOC>
