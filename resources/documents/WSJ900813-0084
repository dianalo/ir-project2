The oil was loaded and shipped before the embargo, andtherefore can't be turned away from their destinations atports in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, U.S. Customsofficials in the region said Friday that many more ships areexpected to follow close behind throughout the month.</LP><TEXT>   The number of ships suggests that Iraq and Kuwait had soldsubstantially more crude oil for delivery to the U.S. inAugust and September than the approximately 800,000 barrels aday of imports that the U.S. Energy Department estimates thetwo Persian Gulf producers averaged from January to May 1989.   Assuming the ships are of a median size of 1.75 millionbarrels and averaging the volumes over 30 days, imports ofIraqi and Kuwaiti crude would total together about 1.75million barrels a day over that period.   It isn't clear, however, whether buyers were expectingsuch elevated volumes to continue or whether those countriessimply made substantial sales in advance of the lastOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting, whenthe group agreed to cut its output to a new ceiling of 22.5million barrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
