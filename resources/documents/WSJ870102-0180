The economy will remain lethargic early this year, according to many financial executives. Thus, they expect the Federal Reserve System to engineer further declines in interest rates by February or March.    Despite widespread concern about a recent surge in oil prices, money managers expect inflation to remain well under control in coming months. Moreover, they say the new tax law, which is expected to discourage borrowing and increase savings, will enhance the appeal of bonds.    &quot;Bonds look very attractive&quot; for the next several months, says William H. Gross, managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif. He expects the economy to remain &quot;stagnant,&quot; prompting the Federal Reserve to cut its discount rate once or twice by midyear. The discount rate, the fee the Federal Reserve charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, has stood at 5 1/2% since August. The Fed cut the rate four times last year, each time by half a percentage point.    Slow economic growth in West Germany and Japan improves the odds for another round of international rate reductions, investment strategists argue. Many expect such a move, which would be designed to stimulate stronger world-wide growth, sometime during this quarter.    &quot;I think you have a good chance to make money on bonds&quot; during the next few months, says Hugo J.H. Schielke, chairman of American andamp; European Investment Corp., a Bethesda, Md. investment advisory firm. He and numerous other money managers expect declines of as much as half a percentage point on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, which now stand at about 7 3/8% after having opened the year at around 9 1/4%.    Some economists predict even sharper declines in borrowing costs this spring. But many money managers still remain apprehensive about the outlook for bonds later this year. They fear faster economic growth and higher commodity prices eventually will translate into higher inflation, triggering a slump in bond prices.    Moreover, some managers also worry that the U.S. dollar will drop further against other foreign currencies, increasing the cost of imported goods and intensifying inflationary pressures. A lower dollar also might prompt foreign investors to shy away from increasing their holdings of dollar-denominated bonds.    Mr. Gross of Pacific Investment warns, &quot;Inflationary fears probably will reemerge later in the year and drive up interest rates.&quot; He adds, &quot;A lot of today's investors grew up in an era of high inflation and that makes them very cautious about holding long-term bonds.&quot;    All that suggests that 1986 will be a tough act for this year's fixed-income markets to follow. A sharp drop in oil prices early last year fueled the biggest bond market rally in history. From Feb. 10 to April 16, some actively traded U.S. Treasury issues soared more than 26 points, or over $260 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds tumbled from 9.29% to 7.11%, the lowest level in about a decade. Since then, long-term Treasury bond yields have ranged between about 7 1/8% and 8%.    An index of U.S. government and corporate bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., registered a total return of about 15.75% last year. That was the third best in the past decade, surpassed only by a 31.09% surge in 1982 and a 21.3% increase in 1985.    Although corporate bonds produced sparkling returns, the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal that broke in mid-November cast a dark cloud over the market for so-called junk bonds, those with less than investment-grade ratings. Ever since then, junk bonds have lagged behind the rest of the bond market amid fear that the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation will produce additional bombshells.    Moreover, many analysts say they plan to shy away from most junk bonds because of concern about the economy's weakness. &quot;I recommend nothing but quality -- Treasurys and the highest-quality corporates,&quot; says A. Gary Shilling, president of an economic research and investment strategy firm bearing his name. The economy's listlessness &quot;could strain the creditworthiness&quot; of many companies and add to bond investors' general fears about lower-quality issues, he says. Also, the insider-trading scandal &quot;may spread even further and cast even more of a pall over junk bonds.&quot;    But junk-bond enthusiasts argue that investors have overreacted to the Boesky affair. They contend that junk bond yields are artificially high, and that this represents a classic buying opportunity. Whatever the case, investors purchased a record number of new junk bond issues last year. Edward I. Altman, a professor of finance at New York University and author of a new book entitled &quot;Investing in Junk Bonds,&quot; estimates that more than $39 billion of new issues were sold in 1986, through Dec. 2. That equals the combined total of the two previous years.    U.S. Treasury bonds still are especially popular because they can be sold quickly in huge blocks, if need be, and because they offer protection against early redemptions. Many companies have taken advantage of falling interest rates to call in bonds before their scheduled maturity date -- to the chagrin of many investors who thought they were holding bonds that wouldn't come due for many years.    Some analysts, such as Mr. Shilling, also are bullish on state and local government bonds, which they say suffered unduly last year because of investor confusion about how these issues would be treated under the tax law. Some long-term tax-exempt bonds now yield about the same as Treasury bonds, which are taxable at the federal level.    Among the fastest-growing bond market investment vehicles last year were &quot;index funds,&quot; bond portfolios designed to match movements in a broad market index. A rapidly growing number of investors are turning to these funds because they have produced higher returns than many money management firms. Also, index funds charge lower management fees than actively managed bond funds.    Last year alone, the amount of money in indexed portfolios quadrupled to nearly $50 billion, a Salomon Brothers Inc. report estimates. The report predicts more fixed-income managers &quot;are likely to index a large core of their portfolios to avoid underperformance.&quot;    Index funds may seem unimaginative and stodgy. But their appeal is surging as more bond investors realize how risky it can be for a money manager to try to outperform the market. Charles D. Ellis, a partner at Greenwich Associates, a Connecticut firm of business-strategy consultants, uses an aviation analogy to summarize the appeal of index funds: &quot;There are old pilots and there are bold pilots -- but there are no old, bold pilots.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
