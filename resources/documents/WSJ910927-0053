Investment partnerships controlled by KKR had beenConAgra's largest stockholder for a little more than a year.In the summer of 1990, the KKR group acquired stock inConAgra as part of the $1.34 billion paid by the Omaha, Neb.,food company to acquire Beatrice Co., a major KKR-owned foodproducer.</LP><TEXT>   In yesterday's transaction, the KKR group sold its entireholding of 10.9 million common shares of ConAgra. The KKRstake was sold in an underwritten public offering managed bySalomon Brothers Inc. at $46.25 a share, exactly in line withConAgra's closing price in New York Stock Exchange trading.The KKR group still owns ConAgra preferred stock that isconvertible into 9.4 million common shares.   KKR is a New York and San Francisco financial firmspecializing in leveraged buy-outs.   The sale of ConAgra stock, which was acquired by the KKRgroup last year at about $31 a share, will generate a heftycash payout for the pension funds, banks and otherlimited-partner investors that bankroll KKR's buy-out pools.   KKR aides last night didn't have an updated calculationfor the buy-out firm's total investment returns on itsBeatrice buyout. That figure has been closely watched overthe years as a gauge of the buy-out business's overallhealth. But in June 1990, KKR claimed a return of about 50% ayear on its Beatrice deal. The latest sale is likely to lowerthat return a percentage point or two, but not affect itsignficantly.   In a statement, KKR said that its continuing stake inConAgra convertible preferred &quot;underscores its belief in thefuture growth potential of the company.&quot; That assessmentappeared to be a slight scaling-back of a June 1990 statementby KKR partner Henry Kravis, who said at the time: &quot;We lookforward to being long-term investors in ConAgra.&quot;   Some of KKR's limited-partner investors, particularlymoney-center banks in need of more liquidity, have beenpressing KKR in recent months to take profits on variousinvestments, rather than sit on large paper gains.   Under terms of the ConAgra convertible preferred stockheld by KKR, the buy-out firm is likely to remain a majorshareholder in ConAgra for at least another 21 months or so.</TEXT></DOC>
