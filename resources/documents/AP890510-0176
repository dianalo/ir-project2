Japan, the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons, isespecially sensitive about any kind of danger from nuclear arms.   The U.S. military said Monday that an A-4 Skyhawk jet carryingthe bomb fell off the U.S. aircraft carrier Ticonderoga in 1965about 80 miles from a small island in southern Okinawa.   The statement followed the release of a report by the Greenpeaceenvironmental group that detailed the loss.   ``The U.S. government said the bomb does not threaten theenvironment,'' Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno said in response toopposition party questions in Parliament on Wednesday.   Uno said Tokyo would decide whether to take action on thematter, which has triggered angry citizen protests, after it hearsfrom Washington. On Monday, the government asked for a U.S.explanation of the incident.   The controversy has added an irritant to U.S. military relationswith Okinawa, site of one of the bloodiest battles in World War II.The presence of about 35,000 U.S. troops there has led to frictionover a range of issues, from soldiers' behavior to target rangeaccidents.   The Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons blastedU.S. secrecy about the bomb loss in a statement Tuesday.   The governor of Okinawa, Junji Nishime, said he will urge thegovernment to take steps to calm anxiety among residents of theisland prefecture. The Okinawa assembly is to open an extraordinarysession to look into the bomb loss.   Another anti-nuclear group in Kagoshima, in southwestern Japan,sent telegrams to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and PresidentBush, asking them to abide by Japan's ban on nuclear weapons orabolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.   Under the treaty, about 60,000 U.S. troops are posted in Japan.   Citizen protests of accidents, aircraft noise and the presumedpresence of nuclear weapons aboard U.S. ships visiting Japan arecommon.   Japan maintains that the security treaty requires priorconsultation by the United States if it wants to introduce nuclearweapons into Japanese territory. It says there never have been anysuch consultations.   U.S. policy is to neither confirm nor deny the presence ofnuclear weapons in specific locations.   Japanese citizens and opposition politicians have accusedWashington of covering up the 1965 incident, but the DefenseDepartment denied the allegations.   ``It was way out to sea in international waters,'' said DefenseDepartment spokesman Dan Howard. ``The weapon went down in 16,000feet of water. There was no danger to anyone. ... There was notthen and there is not now.''   ``We have faithfully honored our obligations under theU.S.-Japanese Treaty of Mutual Security and its relatedarrangements, and we'll continue to do so,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
