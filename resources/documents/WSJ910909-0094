Philanthropic and charitable giving rose 5.75% last yearto $122.57 billion from a revised $115.9 billion in 1989,when the rate of growth was 10.4%, said the AAFRC Trust forPhilanthropy.</LP><TEXT>   Donations from individuals, which make up the bulk of thecontributions, rose 5.19% to $101.8 billion. Foundationscontributed $7.08 billion, up 8.09%, while corporations gave$5.9 billion, up 5.36%. Bequests of estates jumped 11.76% to$7.79 billion.   The trust, established by the American Association of FundRaising Counsel to track charitable and philanthropic giving,said a slowdown in individual contributions, which in 1989grew by 11.7%, accounted for the anemic growth in totalgiving last year. Among the developments that hinderedindividual giving were the recession, a drop in stock pricesin the last two months of the year and a slowdown in personalincome growth.   In inflation-adjusted terms, overall contributions rosejust 0.96%, with individual donations rising 0.42%. Corporategiving increased 0.58%, foundation grants grew 3.19%, andbequests rose 6.69%.   Religion remains the main beneficiary. About $65.76billion, or 53.7% of total contributions, went to religiousorganizations or religious-affiliated social services, up5.2% from 1989. However, donations to educationalinstitutions showed a striking increase, rising 13% to $12.41billion. According to the New York-based Council for Aid toEducation, business gifts to colleges and universities grewmore than 11%.   Other sectors that fared well were organizations promotingthe protection of the environment and wildlife, thoseproviding services overseas and those seeking social changes.Their large increases -- around 30% each -- resulted partlyfrom the appeal these groups have for baby boomers, many ofwhom are now in the prime giving age, the trust said. Anotherreason is that the total contributions to these groups arelow compared with the more traditional categories, so theirrate of growth tends to be higher, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
