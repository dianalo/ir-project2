The Bush administration tried Tuesday to put the best face on aCentral American plan to dismantle the Contras by Dec. 5, pointingout the rebels are under no obligation to do anything unless``safe, democratic conditions'' are established in Nicaraguapermitting their voluntary return.   The administration would have much preferred that the Contrasstay together in their camps along the Honduran border until afterthe Feb. 25, 1990, elections, serving as an incentive for theSandinistas to carry out a fair election process in the interim.   But even if the Contras manage to survive their Dec. 8 deathsentence, there is almost no possibility they will ever again be amajor factor shaping the destiny of their homeland or of CentralAmerica itself.   Not much has gone right for them since President Reagan signedlegislation in October 1986 providing the Contras $100 million ineconomic and military aid:   _Less than a month later the Iran-Contra scandal claimed two oftheir most ardent backers in the administration, Lt. Col. OliverNorth and National Security Adviser John Poindexter. Anothersetback occurred with the death in early 1987 of another stalwartsupporter, CIA Director William Casey.   _In August 1987 the Central American peace agreement was signed,requiring the United States to end its support for the Contras.This considerably strengthened the hand of the anti-Contra bloc inthe Congress.   _In February 1988 the House rejected an administration requestfor additional aid for the Contras. Soon after, an informalcease-fire was agreed to in Nicaragua, and the Contra exodus to thebase camps in Honduras began.   Since then there has been no serious discussion of resuming aidto the Contras. Secretary of State James A. Baker III made clearhis sentiments last March when he declared the Reaganadministration's policy toward the Contras a failure.   The Contras are feeling even more abandoned following theCentral American summit earlier this week in Honduras. The meetingwas preceded by an agreement by President Daniel Ortega andNicaragua's internal opposition declaring that the time had comefor the Contras to go home in peace.   Previously, the Contras and opposition parties enjoyed aninformal alliance, viewing each other as partners in their quest toremove the Sandinistas from power.   The opposition's disassociation from the Contras made it easierfor the Central American presidents to set their December timetablefor the rebels' demobilization. Appeals from the Bushadministration for a less ambitious deadline were ignored.   The rebels are now reduced to ragtag status in the border camps,and their remaining backers in Washington are reduced to no morethan a diehard few here and there.   But there are those who recall with nostalgia the Contras'heyday and with trepidation the what-might-have-beens in CentralAmerica. One former Reagan administration official insists theContras made more of a contribution to U.S. interests than Bakerand other critics give them credit for:   _They were such a nuisance that the Sandinistas had to forgoefforts to carry out subversion elsewhere in Central America,enabling these countries to get a start on establishing democraticsystems. All still have elected presidents.   _It was primarily because of the Contra military threat that theSandinistas agreed to sign the 1987 peace agreement in Guatemala.At that meeting, the Sandinistas won support from other governmentsin the region for an end to U.S. aid to the Contras but also madeunprecedented commitments to bring democracy to Nicaragua.   Although the Sandinista performance in carrying out thesecommitments has not been perfect, the country has not turned intowhat the Reagan administration feared most _ an expansionist,totalitarian one-party state modeled after Cuba.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE _ George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for</NOTE><TEXT>   the Associated Press since 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
