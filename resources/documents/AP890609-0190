(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A decorated Vietnam War veteran fromScotland who federal officials have been trying to deport for 11years can stay in the United States, a federal immigration judgeruled Friday.   ``It's sort of like coming home,'' said Frederick S. Jackson,wiping tears away from his eyes, after Judge Billino W. D'Ambrosiohanded down the ruling. ``I feel a little better about myself.''   The government began deportation proceedings against Jackson in1978, citing his convictions on a string of burglary, larceny anddrug possession charges.   Jackson, 40, has been a resident alien in the United States for20 years. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1967 at age 18, two yearsafter his family emigrated to Norwich, an industrial city about 30miles southeast of Hartford.   He went to Vietnam in January 1968 as an infantryman with the 1stAir Cavalry Division and was awarded two Purple Hearts and a BronzeStar.   D'Ambrosio ruled that Jackson's family ties, his military serviceand efforts to rehabilitate himself outweigh his criminal record,which includes 26 felony convictions since he left the Army in 1970.   Under federal immigration laws, resident aliens who have beenconvicted of at least two crimes involving ``moral turpitude'' aresubject to deportation.   Jackson blames his crimes on post-traumatic stress disorder, apsychological disorder found in some Vietnam veterans and victims ofviolent crimes. Jackson has said flashbacks of terrifying ambushesand firefights led him to abuse drugs and alcohol.   ``Fred was more of a victim than anything,'' said Robert Money ofthe International Institute, Jackson's legal representative duringthe hearings. ``It's been neglect on the part of the VA. Nobodyrecognized the fact that he had PTSD until recently.''   Jackson sought treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder lastsummer at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center inNorthhampton, Mass., and said he has not used drugs or alcohol sincehe began the treatment program.   Jackson's wife, Charlene, said after the hearing that the changesin her husband since he began psychiatric treatment are dramatic.``The difference between three years ago and today is a 180-degreeturnaround,'' she said.   In 1980, Jackson was convicted on armed robbery charges inFlorida. After he was released from prison in 1985, the governmentrenewed its efforts to force Jackson out of the country.   Money said he has filed an application for Jackson to become anaturalized citizen, but he said the application was put on holduntil the judge issued the deportation ruling.   Jackson lives in public housing in Norwich with his wife,Charlene, her 6-year-old son and their infant daughter. The familylives on disability payments from the Army, and from SocialSecurity, which has declared him 100 percent disabled.</TEXT></DOC>
