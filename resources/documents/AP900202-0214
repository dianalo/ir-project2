LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Workers at Chrysler Corp.'s No. 1 plant insuburban Fenton have worked only two weeks since mid-October, sothey weren't too surprised by the announcement that the plant willbe closed permanently in September.   ``In the back of my mind, I kind of thought this was going tohappen,'' said Dennis Moser of Festus, who has been at Plant No. 1for 24{ years.   ``I thought they were leading up to something and I knew theywould have an announcement, but I thought it would be in March.''   Ed Boyer, president of United Auto Workers Local 136, was``disappointed and frustrated'' at Thursday's news.   ``I don't know what the next step's going to be right now,''Boyer said. ``We've got to get some answers to some very importantquestions that we don't have right now.''   National union leaders in Detroit said they didn't understandwhy the St. Louis workers have to be the ``sacrificial victims ofdifficulties in the market.''   In a joint statement, UAW President Owen Bieber and VicePresident Stan Marshall said, ``Workers and their unions don'tdesign the cars or develop the marketing plans.''   The nation's No. 3 automaker said it will close the St. LouisNo. 1 plant Sept. 21 and transfer production of the Dodge Daytonaand Chrysler LeBaron to factories in Newark, Del., and SterlingHeights, Mich.   No work has been done at the plant since Dec. 18.   Plant No. 1, a 2.5 million square-feet facility capable ofproducing 225,000 cars a year, has been in operation more than 30years. The first car, a four-door Plymouth Belvedere, rolled offthe assembly line on Oct. 20, 1959.   Chrysler also operates a neighboring facility in Fenton, PlantNo. 2, which makes mini-vans. None of the estimated 3,500 jobsthere were affected by the announcement.   To prepare for the permanent shutdown, Chrysler will cutproduction at Plant No. 1 to one shift Feb. 12. By September, all3,700 employees will be laid off, although they will have firstchance at several hundred new jobs to be created at the Delawareand Michigan plants.   ``I'd have to go, although I'd go kicking and screaming forsure,'' said Moser, who is less than six years away from qualifyingfor full retirement. ``I've got a whole section of my life tied upwith the Chrysler Corporation and I don't know if they've givenanything back.''   Moser and other auto workers are blaming the layoff onChrysler's strategy of shifting production to Mexico, where laborcosts are much cheaper.   ``Anywhere they can squeeze a penny, they'll squeeze it,'' saidautoworker Rich Bolzenius of Union, a rear window molding fitterwho has been with Chrysler for 13 years. ``They're always trying tomake the worker look like the bad guy because he's not a teamplayer.   ``But the reality of it is, the team concept is just a companyconcept that the workers follow to make it better for the company.''</TEXT></DOC>
