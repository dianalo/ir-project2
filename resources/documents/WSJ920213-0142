Demand for oil,already in oversupply, is expected to slacken seasonallythen.   There were still major differences among the 13 OPECmembers over how deeply to make the cuts and how to dividethem. But there was a consensus that prices will fall furtheras demand drops, unless OPEC prepares now to reduceproduction for at least the next quarter. &quot;The second quarteris the critical one,&quot; said a Saudi delegate.   The ministers will continue talks today. Some ministerssaw promise of a possible breakthrough that may allow them toconclude their negotiations over production quickly.   &quot;We are halfway there,&quot; said Kuwaiti Oil Minister HomoudA. Al-Rqobah. &quot;I hope we will finish by (today).&quot; Kuwait andIraq, both sidelined by the Persian Gulf crisis, are excludedfrom any actual production cuts, although their limitedvolumes are included in the total OPEC output level.   Mr. Al-Rqobah said the different proposals underdiscussion call for a production that would be one of threelevels: 22 million barrels a day, or 22.5 million, or 22.8million. There seemed to be some movement toward the highestrange, which is close to the recommendation by OPEC's owneconomic experts. OPEC currently produces about 24.2 millionbarrels a day.   Depending on how such an output level can be divided, itmight satisfy a number of the group's members, includingSaudi Arabia, the biggest producer, some ministers said. Andsuch an arrangement could hold promise of firming oil prices,they added.   Whichever production level is selected, it will mean ahefty cut -- probably more than one million barrels a day --from currently estimated output of more than 24 millionbarrels a day. Still, some oil ministers say that may not beenough to firm up oil prices.   &quot;At least a 1.5 million cut should be done immediately,&quot;Osama A. R. Al-Hiti, Iraq's oil minister, said in aninterview. &quot;That would stabilize the market,&quot; he said, addingthat an even larger reduction would be necessary to push upprices.   Iraq is excluded from any cuts because it is barred fromexporting oil by the United Nations economic sanctions. But amajor sticking point for most of the others is how theanticipated huge reductions should be shared. Smaller membersof OPEC such as Algeria, which has economic problems andcivil unrest, want Saudi Arabia to account for most of thecutbacks because its production increased the most in thewake of the Persian Gulf crisis. Saudi output, which has beenrunning about 8.5 million barrels a day, has climbed morethan three million barrels a day from the level in July 1990,the month before OPEC abandoned quotas.   There have been indications that Saudi Arabia would bewilling to reduce to about eight million barrels a day solong as others made similar percentage cuts of slightly morethan 5%. &quot;The Saudis are trying hard,&quot; said GholamrezaAghazadeh, Iran's oil minister who is sometimes at odds withhis Saudi counterpart in OPEC.   The Saudis insist that, once an overall OPEC outputceiling is set, new production numbers for all the countrieswill have to be decided on and committed to by the othermembers. &quot;More important than the ceiling is who is gettingwhat,&quot; said an OPEC source close to Saudi policy makers. Itis better, he added, to have a higher ceiling with specificfigures for each member than to have a lower ceiling withoutthe specific numbers for each country if OPEC is to maintaincredibility in the oil markets with its cutbacks.</TEXT></DOC>
