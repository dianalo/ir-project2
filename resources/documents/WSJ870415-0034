Erra, a consultant and director of the company, to the posts of president and chief executive officer.    The 45-year-old Mr. Erra succeeds Ray Mendoza, 56, who had held the posts on an interim basis since last month. Last month Douglas C. Werner resigned as president and chief executive after serving eight months at the helm of this operator of health maintenance organizations. As previously reported, Western Health said Mr. Werner, 43, resigned to pursue other business opportunities.    Mr. Mendoza retains his former posts of executive vice president and chief operating officer, the company said. Mr. Mendoza declined comment.    Mr. Erra, who was elected to Western Health's board last December, formerly was executive vice president and chief administrative officer of the Santa Barbara Medical Foundation Clinic in Santa Barbara, Calif.    As reported, Western Health's financial results have been hurt by its inability to raise prices to keep pace with increases in health-care costs. It had a $740,000 loss on revenue of $89.9 million for the year ended last June 30, but had net income of $748,000, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $50.7 million for the six months ended Dec. 31. </TEXT></DOC>
