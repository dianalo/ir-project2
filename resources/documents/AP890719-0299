FALLSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Wednesday it lost$48 million in the second quarter, citing the continuing effects ofa major reorganization of its transport aircraft business segment.   The loss for the defense contractor caught stock analysts bysurprise and sent the company's stock on the New York Stock Exchangeinto a tailspin.   McDonnell Douglas stock fell $5 a share to $72.   The second-quarter loss contrasted with a profit of $71 million,or $1.83 a share, in the three months ended June 30, 1988.   Second-quarter sales fell 3.6 percent to $3.476 billion from$3.605 billion last year.   The loss comes on the heels of a poor first quarter when thecompany reported a $169 million profit only because of a $179million one-time tax credit.   For the first six months, McDonnell Douglass said it earned $121million, or $3.18 a share, compared with $122 milion, or $3.16 ashare, a year earlier. Six-month revenue fell to $6.82 billion from$6.92 billion.   ``Clearly, two bad quarters in a row with such large losses seemto say McDonnell Douglas is in real difficulty,'' said PhillipBrannon, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research U.S. in New York.   Brannon said he didn't expect the company's problems in thetransport segment, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of thecompany's revenues, would have been so prolonged.   ``This is definitely far worse than I think anyone anticipated,''said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at Prudential-Bache in New York.   In the transport segment, parts shortages and the training ofthousands of new employees have increased costs and forced thereorganization, which began in February and affects 5,000 employees.   McDonnell Douglas said improved performance in the combataircraft and information systems segments was overshadowed by asecond-quarter operating loss of $158 million in the transportaircraft segment, which had revenues of $952 million. That compareswith operating earnings of $10 million on revenues of $1.1 billionin the same quarter last year.   The missiles, space and electronics systems segment had earningsof $10 million in the quarter, down from $37 million in the sameperiod last year due to reduced earnings in the Delta II launchvehicle program and a write-off reflecting higher-than-expectedcosts in a laser communications program.</TEXT></DOC>
