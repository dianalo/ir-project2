This pipeline's basic purpose is now in jeopardy as a resultof the expected decline in production of light Canadian crude. Quebecfeels that the situation presents an opportunity to consolidate and improveCanada's crude oil transportation structure. In addition to the lightcrude currently piped to Montreal, the pipeline could carry greater quantitiesof heavy oil, semi-finished product, and natural gas liquids. Ontariocould be supplied with imported oil it is likely to require by linkingthe Interprovincial pipeline with the American pipeline system betweenthe Gulf of Mexico and Sarnia.</TEXT></DOC>
