Baker III saidtoday the actions of the Palestine Liberation Organization in thewake of an aborted terrorist attack on an Israeli beach have beeninadequate.   But he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the UnitedStates has not made any decision on whether to cut off dialoguewith the PLO because of the matter.   ``We want to weigh matters carefully and do so without thepressure of artificial deadlines,'' said Baker, noting thatsuspending talks with the PLO would have far-reaching ramificationson future Middle East peace efforts.   Abu Abbas, a member of the PLO executive committee, claimedresponsibility for the attempted seaborne attack.   While the PLO has disassociated itself from the attack, thegroup's top leaders have given no indication that they intend totake steps to discipline Abu Abbas, and they have not condemned theattack directly, Baker said.   The United States has urged the PLO to take such steps, he said.   So far the PLO's ``public and private responses have fallenshort of the mark,'' Baker said.   He said U.S. allies, such as Britain, have interceded with thePLO, asking the Arab group to follow the United States' advice.   Over two dozen members of the Senate have urged the Bushadministration to suspend the dialogue with the PLO as a result ofthe attempted attack.</TEXT></DOC>
