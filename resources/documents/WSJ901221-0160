Major commercial banks cut their prime lending ratesone-half percentage point to 12.75%, the lowest level sinceFebruary 1989. The prime rate is a benchmark for variouslending rates.</LP><TEXT>   The Canadian Manufacturers' Association, an industrygroup, said Canada's manufacturing sector &quot;will likely remainin a recession until at least the third quarter of 1991.&quot;   Royal Bank of Canada economist Michael Gregory, warnedthat the current economic recession &quot;is going to get worse.&quot;Canada's gross domestic product declined 0.3% in the secondand third quarters.   Aron Gampel, senior economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, saida cut in U.S. short-term rates this week gave the Bank ofCanada room to lower Canadian rates without weakening thevalue of the Canadian dollar. The Canadian currency has beenbuoyed by wide spreads between comparable Canadian and U.S.short-term interest rates.   Despite yesterday's decline, Canadian short-term interestrates remain more than 4.5 percentage points above U.S.rates. &quot;That's still a very tough monetary policy,&quot; Mr.Gampel said.   The Canadian central bank has maintained a restrictiveeconomic policy because of inflation concerns.   Some provincial politicians who met with Canadian FinanceMinister Michael Wilson yesterday warned that failure to cutinterest rates further will prolong the current recession. &quot;Ithink interest rates have to come down even further,&quot; saidAlberta Treasurer Dick Johnston.   Mr. Wilson said there are still some lingering inflationpressures in the Canadian economy, particularly high wagegains. Interest rates are moving lower, Mr. Wilson said. &quot;Howquickly we can achieve that depends on the inflationarypressures.&quot;   The Canadian Chamber of Commerce urged the government tofreeze spending over the next two years. The group said aspending freeze was the &quot;only viable solution&quot; for achieving&quot;lasting reductions&quot; in interest rates.   Yesterday's prime rate cut followed a drop in the Bank ofCanada's influential bank rate, which fell to 11.78%yesterday from 12.01%. The bank rate is the levy charged bythe central bank on loans to financial institutions.   Royal Bank's Mr. Gregory said Canada's short-term interestrates will likely continue declining until February and thenlevel off to offset the inflationary impact of Canada's new7% value-added tax. The new tax, which received finalapproval this week, is expected to boost the consumer priceindex by a one-time increase of 1.25%. The tax will takeeffect Jan. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
