Their leaders are enraged by President F.W. de Klerk's plans toend apartheid and say they will never accept a black government.Both white and black leaders fear the right wing will provokeviolence that could endanger efforts to find a peaceful solution.   While the pro-apartheid Conservative Party tries to force anelection to unseat de Klerk and his National Party, more radicalgroups are arming for war.   Extremists have raided government armories for guns, neo-Nazisare organizing military units and ``White Wolf'' groups haveattacked blacks.   ``We are preparing ourselves to meet the revolution that Mr.Mandela's killers will start; it will be a holy war,'' extremeright-wing leader Eugene TerreBlanche said in an interview,referring to black leader Nelson Mandela.   On May 26, about 50,000 whites attended a Conservative Partyrally in Pretoria to demand de Klerk's ouster. The crowd cheeredwildly when party leader Andries Treurnicht said whites never wouldsurrender political control.   ``We shall not accept the threatened destruction of our nation'sfreedoms, but will fight to restore that which has already beenunjustly given away,'' Treurnicht declared.   De Klerk said the tactics could start a war between whites. ``TheConservative Party's threats of revolt and resistance areirresponsible, undemocratic and dangerous,'' he said two days afterthe rally.   Officials say a few hundred well-armed extremists with supportersin the security services could launch a devastating terroristcampaign, and attacks on blacks or government leaders could threatenfragile peace negotiations.   ``There is going to be violence,'' said a security official, whowould not let his name be used. ``The question is how much.''   Mandela and other black leaders share the government's concern.   ``Unless the state acts immediately to stop the recent wave ofright-wing attacks on black people, the whole peace process in thiscountry could be in jeopardy,'' said The New Nation newspaper, whichsupports Mandela's African National Congress, the main blackopposition group.   Many of South Africa's 5 million whites oppose plans to dismantleapartheid, the official policy of racial segregation that preservestheir privileges and denies rights to the country's 28 millionblacks.   A growing number of whites, stunned by reforms de Klerk hasintroduced since assuming office last year, are turning to theConservative Party or more extreme organizations. They fear blackswill seek retribution, and many possess weapons in a nationsometimes described as ``awash with guns.''   The Conservatives want whites to keep total control and blacks tobe given political rights in separate, tribal-based states. They sayde Klerk has betrayed whites, above all the dominant Afrikaners, whoare descended from Dutch settlers and account for 60 percent of thewhite population.   De Klerk legalized black opposition groups in February and haspromised to negotiate a new constitution that will lead to powersharing with blacks.   Treurnicht claims whites and blacks cannot live together asequals because of cultural and other differences.   ``Equal votes for blacks is disastrous in terms of racial andpolitical stability,'' he said in an interview.   Like other right-wing leaders, Treurnicht insists Mandela andother black nationalists are Communists. He claims Mandela and hisfollowers are waging war on whites.   Mandela has ``disregarded the existence of the white nation inSouth Africa,'' Treurnicht said. ``He does not intend to recognizeany white community. In a sense, that is a declaration of war on thewhites.''   He says his Conservatives, who won 31 percent of the vote inSeptember's white elections, could win a whites-only election heldnow. National Party officials admit privately the Conservativeswould stand a good chance.   The Conservatives cannot force an election, however, and de Klerkdoes not have to call one until 1994. The government hopes to carryout its reforms before then and show whites they have nothing tofear.   Treurnicht, who holds a doctorate in religious philosophy,disavows violence and says his party will achieve its goals throughthe ballot box, but makes veiled threats of what could happen if itdoes not succeed.   ``We have told Mr. de Klerk you cannot expect a people to liedown if you take away their rights,'' he said.   More extreme organizations, such as the neo-Nazi AfrikanerResistance Movement, are preparing for what their leaders say is aninevitable race war. The groups, which have thousands of members,are forming private armies.   ``I say to the government that, if you are going to sell out thewhites to the blacks in this unjust way, we are going to fight forwhat is rightfully ours,'' Jaap Marais, leader of the Pure NationalParty, said in an interview.   About 300 members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, dressedin khaki uniforms reminiscent of Nazi storm troopers, practicedshooting, riot tactics and marching at a recent training session ona farm outside Johannesburg.   Women in uniforms were taught by former army instructors to usepistols and shotguns. Children played while their parents trained,and there were family picnics under the trees.   Prof. Janis Grobbelaar, a political analyst, said the extremistsbelieve their survival is at stake, and ``these actions should notbe simply dismissed as those of lunatic fringes.''</TEXT></DOC>
