The railroad company said its unit, the Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation Co., has offered to enter into a compromise agreement with the United Transportation Union and accept the board's recommendation that crew size on the Chicago andamp; North Western freight trains be immediately reduced to three from four. The board, which was created in April by President Reagan to avert a strike, also suggested that on certain nonstop freight trains crew size be reduced to two from four.    CNW wants to cut the size of the crews on its freight trains to two from four, claiming that technological advances have made the jobs of two brakemen obsolete. By eliminating the jobs of 1,200 brakemen, the company said it can save about $53 million annually.    CNW said if the union isn't willing to compromise, it will go ahead and exercise its legal right and put its new work rules into effect on Thursday, eliminating all its unproductive brakeman positions. The union can strike in retaliation. Union officials couldn't be immediately reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
