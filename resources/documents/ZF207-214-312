Early (D-Mass.) strongly criticized the 14 percent reductionto roughly $60 million at a hearing of the House Appropriations Subcommitteeon Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies.andP;  &quot;I havea hard time on anything where we're moving away from automation,&quot; Early saidat the PTO appropriations hearing.andM;&quot;I can assure you we're not moving away from automation, Mr. Chairman,&quot; saidDonald J. Quigg, assitant secretary and commissioner of patents andtrademarks.andP;  &quot;It's simply a slowdown of the deployment.&quot;andM;Originally, agency officials planned to deploy the Automated Patent System(APS) much sooner, but &quot;renovations&quot; to the APS plan slowed the schedule,which in turn lowered APS costs for 1990, he said.andM;PTO officials still expect system development will cost $450 million, but thespending will be spread over additional time, Quigg said.andP;  &quot;It doesn't meanthe overall costs over the years is going to be any different,&quot; he said.andO;Total costs for APS are expected to top $800 million.andM;&quot;Usually as you drag something on and on the cost is going to be greater,&quot;Early said.andM;Quigg disagreed.andP;  &quot;We expect the cost of equipment to decrease over time sothat we can stay on budget,&quot; he said, addign he was just supplying thesubcommittee with the administration's budget proposals.andM;&quot;I accept your answers; I think they justify the budget but I don't thinkyour premise justifies the cuts,&quot; Early said.andM;PTO began work on APS, a dual-screen image and text system for use by patentexaminers, in 1983.andP;  The system development has been dogged by technicalflaws, cost increases and schedule delays.andP;  Last year, a panel of industryexperts reviewed APS, harsly criticized it and recommended revamping APSdevelopment and procurement plans.andM;Since the release of that report, PTO has reorganized the automation staff,stabilized a test bed version of APS with one examining unit using it andbegun work on a revised Automation Master Plan incorporating the panel'srecommendations.andM;This master plan is the work of intensive reviews by PTO, the CommerceDepartment and the Office of Management and Budget.andP;  OMB and Commerceofficials met several times to determine the appropriate budget for APS whilethe agency revamped the APS plan.andM;Quigg told Early the new plan would be sent to Congress later this spring.andO;Deployment of the APS system to a second examining group is planned for 1990,but the agency does not expect to make plans for deployment to the remaining12 units until 1991, Quigg said.andP;  &quot;I would personally be the first one to sayif we can get the automation in place faster all the better,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Weare doing everything we can possibly do to get the system working.&quot;andM;The agency may seek supplemental funding later, if as current signs suggest,the APS stabilizes quickly in the second examining group, Quigg said.andM;Even when the hearing turned to other items, Quigg could not escape questionson automation.andP;  On nearly every issue discussed, Early brought up themodernization effort.andM;Quigg told the subcommittee the turnaround time for processing patents is 20months.andP;  He said the agency's goal is to reduce that time to 18 months beforethe end of the year, but patent filings are increasing and could make thatdifficult.andM;Early said if the agency must process more documents, &quot;it tells me you've gota good argument for more automation.&quot;andM;When the subject turned to trademarks and Quigg requested funds foradditional staff, Early again spoke about automation.andP;  &quot;You keep coming infor more people, more people, more people, but I'm of the opinion thereshould be more computers,&quot; he said.andM;Quigg said there was no relationship between the APS and the personnelrequest for the trademarks branch, which has its own automated system.andP;  ButEarly said PTO officials should look at the total bottom line and notnecessarily separate the two sides of the agency.andM;Early ended the hearing by saying he wanted his disagreement with the cutsclearly on the record and he wanted a signed statement from Quiggacknowledging he supported the cuts.andP;  As the agency head, Quigg should notjust offer the administration's budget, but should advise Congress on thesoundness of its recommendations as well, Early said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
