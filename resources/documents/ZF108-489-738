Staiano, president andgeneral manager of Motorola's general systems sector, said in a preparedstatement.andP;  &quot;It is our intention to give customers whatever options theywant.&quot;andM;Motorola says the systems are designed to bring many of the capabilities oftechnical workstations, including high-resolution graphics, to the commercialmarket.andP;  The company also says its new computers undercut the price of asimilar line from IBM--the POWERstation 320, 520 and 530 systems--byapproximately 35%.andM;The new computers conform to the UNIX System V, release 3.2 operating system;Open Standards Interconnection standards; VMEbus architecture; Ethernet LANprotocol; and the Network File System.andM;The MultiPersonal Computer is available in three models.andP;  The MPC-100supports up to 10 workstations and includes a27-million-instruction-per-second processor; 16 megabytes of main memory,expandable to 32MB; and a 300MB hard disk.andP;  The MPC-200 supports up to 24workstations and includes a 33.8MIPS processor; 16MB of main memory,expandable to 64MB; and a 600MB hard disk.andP;  The dual-processor MPC-300supports up to 66 workstations and includes a 67.2MIPS processor; 32MB ofmain memory, expandable to 64MB; and a 1,200MB hard disk.andM;Each system comes bundled with SYSTEM V/88, Motorola's version of UNIX SystemV;

 The 1450SX will run the MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX operating systems.andM;The 1450SX also features a built-in battery recharger, which the company saysallows batteries to be completely recharged in two hours.andP;  Battery-savingfeatures, such as a standby mode that shuts the computer down when not in useand a sleep mode to slow microprocessor speed when maximum speed is notnecessary, are standard.andP;  The 1450SX is priced at $4,995 and is availablenow.andP;  GRID SYSTEMS CORP., Fremont, Calif.andM;Workstations ProduceandM;Animated GraphicsandM;Control Data Corp. has introduced a new line of workstations that producegraphics as realistic as photographic images, the company says.andM;The Cyber 910-700 series offers 3-D graphics capabilities up to 10 times morepowerful than Control Data's current high-end Cyber models, the company says.andO;The workstations use a new graphics processor to create realistic images anddisplay and animate them in real time.andP;  The company says the CYBER 910-700scan create effects such as fog and haze, motion blur, soft shadows, depth offield simulation and stereo.andM;Using the workstations, stylists can create and view a car's metallic surfaceor the wood textures on interior surfaces; engineers can view results ofsimulations such as car crashes, engine combustion and air flow; and weatherservices, government and university research scientists can view enhancedsatellite images and other data.andM;CYBER 910-700 one-, two- and four-processor models are priced from $94,900 to$154,900 and will be available in June.andP;  Customers using previous Cyber910-600 models may upgrade for $50,000.andP;  The UNIX-based systems use a25-megahertz, 20-million-instructions-per-second processor and come standardwith 8 megabytes of memory, expandable to 128MB and a 19-inch high-resolutioncolor monitor.andP;  CONTROL DATA CORP., Minneapolis.andM;IBM Offers ThreeandM;New AS/400 ModelsandM;IBM has upgraded its popular AS/400 line with three new models that offerhigher speed and performance than earlier systems, the company says.andP;
