Energy Factors, an energy services concern specializing in small power plants for industrial, commercial and institutional users, made the disclosure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Company officials couldn't be reached to elaborate.    The filing said that &quot;because of the drop in oil prices and unexpectedly high operating costs,&quot; Energy Factors now expects revenue from the project to be &quot;significantly less&quot; than previously anticipated. It also said that the plant is having start-up delays, and that &quot;unless the economics of this plant can be improved,&quot; the write-downs might be necessary.    Energy Factors had a first-half loss of $2.2 million on revenue of $14.8 million. </TEXT></DOC>
