But, he confided, lowering his voice so that nearby eavesdroppers might not hear: &quot;I'm going to have to go in the {computer} program to see if he's telling the truth.&quot;    A few weeks ago, Shadowfax Software Inc., a small California company, sent me a reviewer's copy of a computer bass-fishing game. The program begins by telling you the season, the weather and the clarity of water at the fictional Stikapig Reservoir. Using the keyboard's arrow keys, you then motor around the lake until you decide, with the help of a fish-finder, where you want to park your boat. Choose a lure, from plastic worms to spoons, and its color. Then fish.    Glenn and his colleagues are hooked on it; they play it on their lunch breaks. Boasts of big lunkers landed and tales of the one that got away emanate from their corner office. For me, however, computer fishing is reason enough to be a Luddite. It's everything fishing isn't: anxiety-ridden, indoors and clinical.    Earlier this fall, my brother, Dan, and I went fishing on Lake Knickerbocker, a favorite of ours in upstate New York. At six in the morning, we rowed out to the undulating lilly pads that ring the edges of the small lake like velvet lining. Dan cast for bass with ugly-looking homemade lures. I used worms. Over the next four hours we hooked a few bass, all under two pounds, none worth keeping, and reeled in an armful of palm-sized bluegills, their bright yellow and blue gills shining brilliantly in the morning sun.    But the catches almost seemed incidental to the company. Dan and I rarely get to spend much time together, so when we do, which is often in the confines of a small aluminum boat, we talk about our work, our loves, our parents and other matters close to the heart. I relished the company, the early morning sun and the late-blooming flowers as much as I did the 20-or-so fish we hauled in. And that is why computer fishing holds no appeal for me.    The game is undoubtedly entertaining. And my friends in the communication department will attest to that. Sometimes your computer partner will land one, the terminal chirping away in an apparent imitation of a drowning bass. If your casts turn up empty, as they frequently do, the computer will respond with such small talk as &quot;How could they resist that lure?&quot; or &quot;Better than the best day working.&quot; The guys in communications say it teaches you a lot about what kind of lure to use or in what part of a lake to fish. But five minutes of fishing in my climate-controlled office is about all I can take.    Where is the cradlelike rocking of an early morning lake or the chill of early fall? And the plaintive cries of loons or the magnificent sight of a bald eagle protecting its tree-top nest? And wither the adrenalin rush of hooking a good-sized bass, watching it leap from the water in its purposeful frenzy to free itself? But what worries me most of all is where's Dan? Since he lives in New York and I in Chicago, our time on the lake together is precious and fragile.    So, in light of all this, I called my brother to tell him about this game and, I hoped, to share my derision for desk fishing. He asked all sorts of questions. Does it tell you how big the fish are? (Yes.) Can you catch fish other than bass? (No?) I could hear some excitement in his voice. &quot;It sounds like fun,&quot; he said. I admittedly got testy and told him I was disappointed in him. We exchanged words. &quot;If you're asking me whether I'd rather go fishing or play your stupid little game, the answer's obvious,&quot; he said.    For just a moment, I guess, I worried I'd lose my brother to a computer game. It was a silly thought. Sitting in a desk chair instead of paddling a canoe, pounding cursors instead of casting a line, and staring into a computer screen instead of peering into the silvery water of a still lake will never, for either Dan or me, replace the natural rhythms of real fishing.    So, I have learned, at the very least, to tolerate computer fishing. I was in the communications department the other day with Glenn and his friends. They were still arguing over whether their colleague had actually landed a 23-pound bass. &quot;He's lying,&quot; insisted Al Murawski, his boss.    I figured I'd try to put an end to the dispute. It reminded me too much of what they were missing. Such arguments, it seems, are more good-spirited and much softer at six in the morning under cover of a soupy fog. I called Shadowfax Software, the game's maker. The company told me, yes, it was possible to catch a 23-pounder, but chances were one in 10,000. At least one thing is quite realistic. Like most fish tales, the truth will never be known.    ---   Mr. Kotlowitz is a reporter in the Journal's Chicago bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
