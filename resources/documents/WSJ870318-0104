The long-awaited study, which was requested by President Reagan, also highlights the need to harness nuclear power, coal and natural-gas reserves to protect against what it predicts may be a near-doubling in oil imports by the mid-1990s. And it suggests that despite White House opposition, accelerated filling of the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be an important move to safeguard U.S. energy security.    Calling the report a &quot;warning signal,&quot; Energy Secretary John Herrington told reporters that current production and consumption trends pose &quot;a clear risk&quot; to U.S. long-term national-security interests that can't be ignored. Based on the report's main findings, Mr. Herrington asserted, &quot;it is time to plan&quot; new initiatives and reassess some of the administration's longstanding energy policies.    The report is likely to help shape intensifying congressional and cabinet debate over the problems of domestic oil producers. The report doesn't contain any firm policy recommendations, however, and doesn't go nearly as far in proposing solutions as many oil-state lawmakers and domestic oil producers advocated.    Other critics asserted that the report understates the role of renewable energy resources, and that its findings will be used to reduce environmental protection for offshore drilling sites and in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    In a series of detailed cost-benefit analyses, the report indicates that imposition of a $10-a-barrel fee on imported oil would slash at least $32 billion in one year from the nation's gross national product. &quot;I don't see this as a viable option,&quot; Mr. Herrington said.    The oil industry itself is sharply divided over the issue, with independent producers overwhelmingly supporting such a fee while some major international oil companies oppose it as an invitation to other taxes and a potentially cumbersome measure to enforce.    A spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute said the &quot;thrust of the report seems to be in the right direction, although it may somewhat understate the problem.&quot; Reflecting the views of many independents in the oil patch, George Mitchell, chairman of Mitchell Energy andamp; Development Corp., said the report &quot;all but rules out&quot; an import fee, which he called &quot;the only option that can make an immediate difference&quot; for the industry.    The report and Mr. Herrington's comments suggest that the administration is searching for a politically palatable compromise that will demonstrate its commitment to help the industry without abandoning free-market principles. &quot;It's an effort to buy the White House some political peace,&quot; asserted Edwin Rothschild, a spokesman for Citizen/Labor Energy Coalition, &quot;rather than practical prescriptions for a sound and coherent national energy policy.&quot;    By the end of 1995, according to the report, Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65% of the free world's total oil consumption.    In discussing the most effective ways to spur domestic production, the report suggests higher depletion allowances, repeal of the 1980 windfall-profits tax, and repeal of the so-called transfer rule, which relates to tax treatment of certain properties purchased by independents from major oil companies. </TEXT></DOC>
