Nine determinations were made by the techniquesof stepwise heating and three by metting of the sample. The differentapparent ages of the minerals (515-1200 My), obtained by the techniqueof stepwise heating, seem to imply a a complex geologic history for theregion, and confirms the existence of older emplacement nuclei, pre-Brazilians,affected by two orogenic cycles, at least, the first pre-Brazilian andthe cycles, at least, the first pre-Brazilian and the second, Brazilian.On the other hand, the age determinations obtained by melting of plagioclasses({similar_to}730 My), agreed with the conventional K-ar apparent ages,a fact with no geological meaning. The preliminary results show thatthe stepwise heating technique may become a valuable tool in the studyof policyclic samples, because it permits to distinguish between disturbedand undisturbed rocks. The same cannot be said of the melting technique.In this latter case the results can be used only comparatively.</TEXT></DOC>
