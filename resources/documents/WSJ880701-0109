Lewis Ranieri, a one-time star at Salomon Inc., played a big role in the purchase by bringing two major investors -- the New York investment bank of Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co. and San Diego-based Imperial Corp. of America, a savings-and-loan holding company -- into a group of prominent South Carolina investors to buy the island.    Mr. Ranieri was fired by Salomon last year in the wake of policy and personality clashes with the investment-banking firm's chairman. The sale, the biggest real estate transaction in South Carolina history, is one of Mr. Ranieri's first big deals since leaving Salomon and setting up an investment banking boutique known as Ranieri, Wilson andamp; Co.    Kiawah, a 10,000-acre island 21 miles southwest of Charleston, is potentially one of the choicest golf resorts in the country. It has 11 miles of unspoiled beaches and three golf courses, designed by professional golfers Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus and golf-course designer Tom Fazio.    In recent years, however, it has lagged -- at least in part because of problems between its 2,500 property owners and Kuwait Investment Co., the island's former owner. Sales of homes and condominiums fell to about $25 million last year from $60 million in 1984. Occupancy at the island's inn has fallen to about 35% from 80% for the same period.    &quot;There was some friction between property owners and the Kuwait Investment Co. over. . .utility rates and club structures,&quot; said Frank Brumley, a South Carolina developer and chief executive officer of the new owner, known as Kiawah Resort Associates.    &quot;It hadn't gone well. The Kuwaitis terminated their architects and engineers and cut back on marketing. They basically had the island on hold,&quot; he added.    Mr. Brumley said the new owners plan a major new hotel, substantial development and &quot;aggressive national marketing&quot; to bring sales back to their prior level.    A unit of NCNB Corp., the Charlotte, N.C., bank holding company, financed the sale. Saleh al-Zouman, who ran the resort for Kuwait Investment, couldn't be reached for comment. Executives at Ranieri Wilson also couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
