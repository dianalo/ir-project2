But the proposal was promptly rejected by a debate panelset up by the two political parties.;   The presidents of CBS, NBC, ABC andCNN said they would produce the 90-minute, prime-time debates in New York,Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles on four specified dates in September andOctober 1992.

But it got thecold shoulder from former Republican chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. and formerDemocratic chairman Paul Kirk Jr., co-chairmen of the Commission onPresidential Debates, the bipartisan group that sponsored the 1988 debates.;  Fahrenkopf and Kirk warned against &quot;conflicts which arise when mediaorganizations whose function it is to report political news undertake toproduce or participate in the news-making events.&quot;;   Network officials saidthe panel, which raises private funds, was protecting its turf and that itsopposition did not amount to a veto. &quot;We're going forward with our plan,&quot; saidTimothy Russert, NBC's Washington bureau chief. &quot;It would be very destructiveif it became a competition to see who could lure the candidates, becauseobviously the candidates will shop for the best deal.&quot;;   Democratic NationalChairman Ron Brown &quot;generally supports the proposal&quot; but wants to consult withparty candidates, a spokeswoman said. An aide to GOP Chairman Clayton Yeuttercalled the plan &quot;premature,&quot; saying, &quot;These are decisions . . . that only thecandidates can make.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910926  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  275  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, September 26, 199100270040,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
