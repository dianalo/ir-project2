Theoccupiers had seen to that, at the same time that they weresquiring Western reporters around Baghdad to assure therewould be plenty of footage of bomb damage and similartestimony portraying Iraq as a victim of Allied aggression.Before lurching into the postwar era it's worth taking note,for the record, of the pictures, only now becoming available,detailing Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait. CBS correspondent EricEngberg reported what had happened to the animals at theKuwait City zoo. The animals had been tortured with polesjammed into their cages, or killed. The Iraqis had apparentlyamused themselves by using the zoo animals for targetpractice. A bear beaten by the soldiers lay slumped on theground.   There was nothing approaching this level of horror in thescenes -- on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot; -- of the ravagedKuwaiti campuses, but they were remarkable scenes of plunderand destruction nonetheless. Standing in the ruins of anoffice, a staff member of the Kuwaiti Institute forScientific Research told how the Iraqis had come in withlists of what they wanted to carry away. What they did notwant or could not take, the witness recalled, they destroyed-- computers, tapes, years of scholarly work. But the mostmemorable testimony by far emerged on &quot;The MacNeil/LehrerReport,&quot; which provided a dispatch from an IndependentTelevision News journalist reporting from the scene of a massgrave for nearly 3,000 murdered Kuwaitis.</LP><TEXT>   Torture had made some of the victims unrecognizable, ITN'sJohn Alcott noted. During the occupation the cemetery staffhad taken secret photos of the dead so as to have evidence ofatrocities. ITN's Charles Krause next provided a chillingtour of the Kuwait City sports complex, which the Iraqis hadturned into a detention center. Departing in a hurry, theperpetrators had left considerable evidence, not least theroom where, as the cameras showed, the electric wires usedfor the torture of prisoners were still connected.   In the days just before the ground war began, the Iraqisoldiers had raced through the streets, into homes, and hadsurrounded the mosques, where they seized the men and boysthey would take away as hostages. The description of thisevent (through an interpreter) by a grieving Kuwaiti womanhad the ring of ancient tragedy. Palestinians collaboratingwith the Iraqis had stopped her son's car and then turned himover to Iraqi soldiers, she told the reporter. She herselfhad then hurled herself on the car, pleading with thesoldier: &quot;I kissed his head. I kissed him, begging him to letmy son go. He pushed me away.&quot;   Two nights later, the same ITN correspondent introducedMacNeil/Lehrer viewers to an altogether different stratum ofKuwaitis -- the Westernized upper crust -- and in so doingproduced a riveting social portrait. (One much facilitated byMr. Krause's skill at asking questions and -- what is usuallymore important in interviews -- his skill at keeping quiet.)His subjects were two handsome, poised and Westernized women,cousins, who had clearly had the best English education moneycan buy, and who were now in the same straits as thechador-covered woman grieving for her son. They too, had lostthe man in the family, taken as hostage, had suffered underthe occupation and now seethed with rage against thePalestinians, who had, they felt, betrayed Kuwait. They wereabove all proud of the resistance and of the part they hadplayed in it. The experience of oppression, it is no news,can work wonders for one's outlook, as these Kuwaitiworldlings had discovered.   &quot;This is the first time that I felt, my country,&quot; one ofthe women asserted, and there was both ardor and wonder inthe pronouncement. But it had taken all this suffering, sheadded, to bring such feelings to life for the first time. Itwas something to remember, this impassioned scene in thedrawing room of upper-class Kuwait, where the spirit ofnationalism now lived. It was like the host of othermemorable television scenes this war has producedand thereare more to come.   While we were away at that war, there were of course otherthings to watch on the screen -- not that many peoplenoticed.   There were, for example, some above-averagemade-for-television movies that deserve mention, better latethan never. Yesterday's CBS movie, &quot;Aftermath,&quot; belongs inthis category. The story of a horrendous actual crime, whichmust have upset a great many people who watched it, this JudiGregg and Helena Hacker production dealt out the facts withgrit and -- mostly -- fidelity to the truth of events. Thisis not nothing in the world of television, where history isregularly rewritten and then presented as a &quot;fact-basedmovie.&quot;   Mainly, though, it is ABC that has cornered the market onthe season's worthwhile films: witness offerings like &quot;TheLast Best Year&quot; and tonight's &quot;Lucky Day&quot; (9-11 p.m.), whichis not to be missed for reasons that will soon be clear toanyone sitting down to watch it.   Now that the Gulf conflict is over there is less worrythat a movie will become a war casualty, as was the case with&quot;The Last to Go,&quot; an admirable ABC film that aired just asthe public was most transfixed by the war. To be sure ABC wasparticularly haunted by a streak of bad timing having to dowith subject matter, not just audience inattention. Take themovie &quot;Hostage&quot; starring Marlo Thomas playing Sis Levin, wifeof Iran hostage Jeremy Levin. This shrill indictment of U.S.officialdom and policies also throbbed with understanding forthe perpetrators of terrorism, and took a beating both in theratings and from critics. It was not, Allen Sabinson, ABCexecutive vice president for TV motion pictures, recentlymused, what the American public wanted to watch just then.Still better -- or worse -- ABC had Vanessa Redgrave -- whohad only recently called on all good people to defend Iraqagainst American and British imperialists -- starring in itsremake of &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane.&quot; As ever, itraineth on the just and the unjust alike.</TEXT></DOC>
