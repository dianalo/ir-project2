Single crystal x-ray diffraction datawere used to determine a pseudo-tetragonal structure based on an A-centeredorthorhombic subcell with a = 5.399 A, b = 5.414 A, and c = 30.904 A.The structure contains copper-oxygen sheets as in La{sub 2}CuO{sub 4}and YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7}, but the copper-oxygen chains presentin YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7} do not occur in Bi{sub 2}Sr/sub 3-x/Ca/subx/Cu{sub 2}O/sub 8+y/. The structure is made up of alternating doublecopper-oxygen sheets and double bismuth-oxygen sheets. There are Ca{sup2+} and Sr{sup 2+} cations between the adjacent Cu-O sheets; Sr{sup 2+}cations are also found between the Cu-O and Bi-O sheets. Electron microscopystudies show an incommensurate superstructure along the a axis that canbe approximated by an increase of a factor of 5 over the subcell dimension.This superstructure is also observed by x-ray diffraction on single crystals,but twinning can make it appear that the superstructure is along botha and b axes. Flux exclusion begins in our samples at about 116 K andis very strong by 95 K. Electrical measurements on a single crystal ofBi{sub 2}Sr/sub 3-x/Ca/sub x/Cu{sub 2}O/sub 8+y/ show a resistivity dropat about 116 K and apparent zero resistivity at 91 K. 7 references, 5figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
