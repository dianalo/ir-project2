As part of a campaign to get back to break-evenperformance this year, GM is mounting an aggressive effort toslash its bureaucracy by pensioning off salaried workers asyoung as 51 years old. In the past, many of GM's white-collarstaffers have rejected the company's early-retirement offersand assumed that another &quot;window&quot; would open.</LP><TEXT>   But this time, company executives are warning thatsweetened retirement deals won't be offered again soon.Moreover, GM executives aren't ruling out firing white-collarworkers later this year if the company falls short of itscost-cutting goals.   &quot;We won't have a retirement window next year,&quot; a GMspokesman said. &quot;It's a business decision. We want toaccomplish our goals as quickly as possible.&quot; In addition,the spokesman said, certain federal regulations couldpenalize GM if the auto maker continues to offer special,sweetened retirement terms to some employees but not others.   In December, GM said it would shut 21 more factories andcut a total of 74,000 salaried and hourly jobs by 1995 aspart of a sweeping retrenchment. The company said it wouldshed some 9,000 of its roughly 91,000 white-collar jobs inNorth America in this year alone. Now it appears that GM ispushing to accomplish that initial 10% cut in salaried staffby midyear.</TEXT></DOC>
