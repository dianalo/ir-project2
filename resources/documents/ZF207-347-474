robustdemand in Europe and the Far East more than offsets soft U.S.andP;  order rates.andO;On the supply side and in the long term, the hardware vendors face seriousproblems.andM;Key reasons for their difficulties are users' insistence that standards beincorporated in most products, and the availability of more powerfulmicroprocessors easily connectable to networks.andM;The hardware vendors know that wholesale adoption of standards for databaseprotocols, graphical user interfaces, operating systems, data communicationsand so on eventually will devalue their huge investments in proprietarymainframe and minicomputer architectures.andP;  Many new companies are only tooready to adhere to these standards to capture or hold market share.andP;  And manyusers, especially federal government buyers, know that standards-compliantproducts implemented on distributed micro-based systems often are morecost-effective than hierarchical large host-processor-based designs.andM;Thus the revenue growth prospects of mainframe and minicomputer suppliers whodepend on proprietary architectures are beclouded.andP;  Add the evidence thathardware demand is maturing, and we have grounds for concern about systemvendors' prospects.andM;For now, systems companies with clout -- IBM Corp., Digital Equipment Corp.,andO;Hewlett-Packard Co. and Unisys Corp. -- command customer loyalty.andP;  Thereforethey reduce the impact of standardization on their profitability.andM;The second-tier systems manufacturers -- Control Data Corp., Bull HNInformation Systems Inc., Data General Corp., Nixdorf Computer Corp., PrimeComputer Inc., Olivetti USA and Wang Laboratories Inc. -- are not so blessed,as their 1988 reports show.andM;Their customer bases are not big enough to support Randamp;D needed to keep theirproprietary product lines competitive and assure customers of their long-termviability.andP;  This tempts customers to develop new applications onarchitectures supported by the dominant vendors or on system designs usingthe major hardware, software and communications standards.andM;Difficult TransitionandM;The first-tier systems suppliers also face a difficult product-linetransition.andP;  Ferocious competition, especially from start-ups unencumbered bycustomer bases built on propprietary architectures, puts pressure on pricing.andO;Users, led by federal buyers, demand to enjoy the benefits of distributedsystems based on standards.andP;  As a result, all systems vendors, from mightyIBM to hard-pressed Data General and Wang, have had to offer micro-basedhardware platforms supporting UNIX, MS-DOS or OS/2.andM;To compete on performance they must choose between complex-instruction-setcomputing and reduced-instruction-set computing architectures, and betweentightly coupled multiprocessing or parallel processing designs.andM;To implement UNIX, vendors may have to take sides in the industry quarrelbetween the Open Software Foundation and UNIX International Inc.andP;  In adoptinga microprocessor design they may have to take sides on the issue of ExtendedIndustry Standard Architecture vs.andP;  IBM's Micro Channel Architecture.andM;The smaller players lack the critical mass and well-developed market focus ofthe major companies.andP;  To conserve money they rely on UNIX platforms fromindependents such as Arix Corp., Apollo Computer Inc., MIPS SoftwareDevelopment Inc. or Sun Microsystems Inc.andM;On the other hand, IBM and Hewlett-Packard are developing their own RISCarchitectures, while DEC and IBM have their own versions of UNIX -- Ultrixand AIX respectively.andP;  Systems vendors pay royalties to ATandamp;T for UNIX, toMicrosoft for MS-DOS and OS/2, and to IBM for Micro Channel design.andP;  Manywill face a profit squeeze as hardware prices come down.andM;Gross margins are the key to high profitability.andP;  The need to provide saidsales and service support adds to the vendors' costs.andM;Users also expect their hardware and software suppliers to offer systemsintegration capabilities, particularly for complex networked applications.andO;Thus the second-tier suppliers face a difficult choice: achieve criticalmass; become a systems integrator; participate in the still vibrant marketsegments via acquisition; or allow oneself to be acquired.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
