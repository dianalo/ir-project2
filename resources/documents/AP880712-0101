On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a sensitive barometer ofprice trends, the August-delivery price for West Texas Intermediatewas $14.49 a barrel by midday, down 29 cents from the 20-monthclosing low of $14.78 set Monday.   ``The market is awash in crude and the focus has returned tothat,'' said Chris McCormack, an energy futures trader with the NewYork investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``The market justlooks extremely bearish.''   The decline Monday erased gains made last week, which were basedon fears of supply disruptions caused by a major oil platformexplosion in the North Sea.   Refined products traded on the exchange also fell sharply,although not as steeply as crude. Wholesale heating oil for Augustdelivery fell 2.06 cents a gallon to 41.33 cents, while wholesaleunleaded gasoline fell 1.04 cents a gallon to 52.13 cents.   At one point during the day, crude prices rose briefly on a newsreport that the price-monitoring committee of the 13-memberOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might confer soon.   OPEC's official news agency said the meeting might be held afterthe cartel's general secretary, Indonesia's Subroto, met withofficials of the United Arab Emirates for talks ``concerning thecurrent oil market situation.'' Output cheating by members of thecartel has weakened the market seriously recently, making OPEC's$18-per-barrel target price more remote than ever. The United ArabEmirates has been mentioned as a significant violator.   Said Edward Ryan, a trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.'s energyfutures unit, ``Crude has gotten down to a supply-demand scenario.There's simply too much. I think the market needs to see somethingof substance. The rhetoric of OPEC is ridiculous. Every traderconsiders it ridiculous.''   By some analyst reckonings, the cartel now is pumping as much as18.8 million barrels a day, more than 3 million barrels a day overits official ceiling of 15.06 million barrels.</TEXT></DOC>
