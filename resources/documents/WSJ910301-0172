Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/01/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A2</SO><IN>BANKS (BNK)</IN><GV>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ChairmanWilliam Seidman unveiled his latest plan to bolster the BankInsurance Fund without direct taxpayer assistance and wonearly, if muted, support from Congress and the bankingindustry.   The two-part plan, produced after months of discussionsbetween the industry and the FDIC, involves new borrowing ofas much as $25 billion, if necessary. The money would berepaid by charging banks higher insurance premiums. Althoughimportant details remain to be worked out, the proposalincludes at least some elements that every constituencywants, and these sweeteners help explain the early supportfor the proposal.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, the five-member FDIC board moved forward withthe first phase of the plan. It proposed increasing thepremium banks pay into the fund to 23 cents on each $100 ofdomestic deposits from the current 19.5 cents, effective July1. The board gave the public 30 days to comment on theproposal, which Mr. Seidman had announced earlier.   The premium increase, which will cost banks $870 million ayear, will support borrowings of as much as $10 billion tomeet working-capital needs for the insurance fund. The FDIChasn't decided where to borrow the money. The candidates are:the Treasury, The Federal Reserve Board, the FederalFinancing Bank or the bank industry.   The second phase of the plan calls for increasing theFDIC's line of credit from the Treasury to $20 billion fromthe current $5 billion. The agency said it would boostpremiums by 0.35 cent for every $1 billion it borrowed abovethe current $5 billion limit.   &quot;We're not proposing to borrow all this money now, andhopefully we'll never have to borrow it,&quot; Mr. Seidmanexplained at a meeting with reporters. But he called theproposal &quot;a good banker's plan&quot; because it pinpoints revenueto repay possible borrowings. He said the proposal should beenough to get the shrinking insurance fund through &quot;thehigh-stress period we're in now&quot; because of the numerous bankfailures in recent years.   After explaining the plan at a news meeting, Mr. Seidmandiscussed the plan before the Financial InstitutionsSubcommittee of the House Banking Committee, where members,while making it clear that they need more details, seemedpleased by the proposal. Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.)called it &quot;a well-thought out plan,&quot; and Rep. Chalmers Wylie(R., Ohio) expressed pleasure when he heard that the FDICalready was moving forward with the first phase, whichdoesn't require congressional action.   In a year when the Bush administration wants to overhaulthe banking system and Congress is still smarting from thecost of the savings-and-loan disaster, the Seidman planoffers Congress exactly what it wants: a way to rebuild theBank Insurance Fund without having to appropriate any money.   The FDIC insurance-fund plan drew guarded support from thebanking industry, which has been complaining about the rapidrise in the premium that was just 12 cents per $100 ofdeposits at the end of last year. But industry officialsreiterated that Congress must find a way to stop the bankinsurance fund from protecting uninsured deposits in caseswhere the government decides a bank is &quot;too big to fail.&quot;   In an analysis of the economic impact of the 3.5-cent, or18%, premium increase, the FDIC staff said &quot;it's reasonableto expect that some portion of the assessment increase willbe passed along to bank customers.&quot; Although the higherpremium could push a few extremely weak banks closer tofailure, &quot;the overall impact is expected to be negligible,&quot;the agency said.   Bankers are fearful of future premium increases,particularly if the recession persists. To address thatconcern, the second part of the FDIC plan proposes to cap thepremium at 30 cents per $100 of domestic deposits; that wouldbe enough to cover an additional $15 billion of new borrowingfrom the Treasury that the second stage would allow. Theproposal also would give the FDIC wide latitude to change theway assessments are calculated.</TEXT></DOC>
