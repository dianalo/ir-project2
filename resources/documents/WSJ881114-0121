The West German chancellor is in New York for the 80th birthday of Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi-hunter. Thursday, the speaker of the West German Parliament, Philipp Jenninger, delivered what he expected to be a serious but routine commemoration of Kristallnacht, the night the Nazis first went public with organized terror against Jews a half-century ago. Before the speaker was through his text, 50 parliamentarians had walked out. Four U.S. church leaders soon broke off a visit to Germany in protest. Israel got angry. Mr. Jenninger resigned. A West German daily called his remarks &quot;perhaps the most unfortunate speech that was ever made in the Federal Republic.&quot;    Talking about the century's worst massacre isn't easy when your own people were the ones who perpetrated it. Ever since Konrad Adenauer's government began reparation payments to Jewish families three decades ago, West Germany has voiced national contrition over the Germans' annihilation of six million Jews. Most foreign governments credit these efforts with great respect. But something odd is happening in West Germany. As the number of years since the Nazi genocide grows, so does political sensitivity to the issue.    Thursday morning, Bundestag members sat down in a hall decked with white flowers and listened to a song in Yiddish about the destruction of the Krakow ghetto: &quot;It burns, brother, it burns.&quot; Then a famous actress recited &quot;Fugue of Death,&quot; an elegy on concentration camps by the poet Paul Celan. Finally came Mr. Jenninger, a bespectacled fellow in a dark suit. He began: &quot;Jews in Germany and in all the world today commemorate the events of 50 years ago. We Germans too recall that which was carried out in our land, and this is good. . . .&quot;    Then Mr. Jenninger reviewed what happened in Hitler's Germany 50 Novembers ago. &quot;Well over 200 synagogues were burned down or demolished, Jewish cemeteries were laid in ruins, thousands of businesses and homes were destroyed and plundered. Some 100 Jews met death, 30,000 were dragged off to concentration camps, many of them never found their way back.&quot; Next, he described the German people's reaction: &quot;All saw what happened, but most looked away, and were silent. The churches, too, were silent.&quot;    Then came the section that enraged the parliamentarians, where Mr. Jenninger detailed Adolf Hitler's racist philosophy, with which &quot;Germany had said goodbye to all humanitarian ideas.&quot; He described the murderous consequences of national support for Hitler's fevered plans. &quot;For the destiny of the Germans and European Jews, Hitler's successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and misdeeds.&quot; Mr. Jenninger said, &quot;The years from 1933 to 1938, even from a distant retrospective and in the knowledge of what followed, still are a fascinating thing today, since throughout history there is hardly a parallel to Hitler's triumphal procession during the first years.&quot; And Mr. Jenninger offered a rendition of German feelings about Jews under the Nazis. &quot;What concerned the Jews: Hadn't they played a role that didn't suit them in the past? . . . Didn't they perhaps even deserve {to be shown their place?} And above all: Didn't the propaganda -- excepting wild, unserious exaggerations -- correspond to some suppositions and convictions?&quot;    Then Mr. Jenninger warned against forgetting: &quot;Our past will not rest. . . . Young Germans must accept that they are Germans, and that they can't steal away from this fate.&quot; His remarks included quotations from a witness of SS death squads. &quot;I went around a hill and stood before a giant grave. The people were so closely piled on top of each other that only heads could be seen. Blood ran from almost all the heads, onto shoulders. A part of those who had been shot were still moving. Some raised their arms and turned their heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was already three-quarters full. . . .&quot;    This last report is one of the more moving in the long but bland history of German speechifying on the Nazis. It is more explicit -- more daring -- than any part of the address on a similar theme that won West Germany's president, Richard von Weizsaecker, international respect in 1985. But the account is one many of the parliamentarians didn't hear -- some 50 of them had already left the room. They included members of the nation's gadfly environmentalist group, the Green Party, members of the opposition Social Democratic Party and some members of the liberal Free Democrats, junior partners in the Kohl coalition.    What, then, caused the bitterness, that likely ended the career of Mr. Jenninger, a man too young to have a Nazi past -- he was born in 1932 -- and with 19 years' tenure in Parliament and a reputation as a friend of Israel? Criticism focused on Mr. Jenninger's decision to speak -- for eight paragraphs -- from the point of view of Germans in the 1930s, without distancing himself from their heinous opinions. This is a dramatic device. It's the kind of thing West Germany's Bundestag -- an erudite body packed with Ph.D.s -- is sophisticated enough to recognize. It's one they did recognize. Not even the Greens are calling Mr. Jenninger a Nazi. The opposition sought -- and got -- his resignation on grounds the speech was &quot;reprehensible&quot; because it was &quot;inept.&quot;    This rage is in part due to genuine sensitivity over the Nazi period. As Mr. Jenninger himself reportedly commented, &quot;In Germany, one can't call everything by its name.&quot; But protesters also have something to gain that has nothing to do with Jewish tragedy. The leftist Greens gain strength every time they can shake the authority of the liberal-conservative coalition. Outrage similarly serves the Social Democrats. The Free Democrats gain from chances to show their parliamentary muscle.    Mr. Kohl, by dropping Mr. Jenninger, made it possible for himself to welcome George Bush into the club of world leaders without facing the embarrassing -- and inaccurate -- question: &quot;Why does your government keep a Nazi?&quot; But international groups that attacked Mr. Jenninger's remarks may find themselves among the losers. When they cry wolf, they weaken their authority to speak against genuine transgression. One of the few supporting voices for Mr. Jenninger is Michael Fuerst, deputy chairman of West Germany's Central Jewish Council, who reportedly said, &quot;I welcome that the Parliament president described in full clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938.&quot;    The bigger losers are those who really care about remembering Germany's past. When Mr. Kohl speaks today in New York, he's likely to avoid the kind of frank exposition that shows what Germans are -- an important people with a terrible history. The Green Party politicians explained they were protesting the Kristallnacht speech in the hope that &quot;discussion about guilt and responsibility for this recent history will take place.&quot; That is exactly what they are preventing.    ---   Miss Shlaes is editorial-features editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
