Plastic surgeon Elizabeth Morgan of Washington, D.C., wasreunited over the weekend with her daughter 10 days after themother arrived in New Zealand to discuss the case with her lawyers.   She has accused the father, dental surgeon Eric Foretich, ofsexually molesting the child and in 1987 began serving 25 months injail for refusing to reveal Hilary's whereabouts.   Foretich denies the charges. He saw his daughter last week forthe first time in more than two years and has since returned to hisFalls Church, Va., home.   Hilary was spirited to New Zealand 18 months ago to live withher maternal grandparents, William and Antonia Morgan.   Morgan flew from Auckland to Christchurch to be with her childand her own parents. The group has been staying at a motel whileHilary attends a private school.   Morgan would not allow news media near her daughter followingthe weekend reunion and pledged Monday to dodge the media as shecontinues her fight for custody.   Hilary's hiding place became the focus of world attention whenher father found her here three weeks ago.   The New Zealand Family Court is to rule on the custody issue andhas barred reporters from covering the proceedings. No date hasbeen publicly announced for the hearing. Foretich and Morgan noware divorced.   Morgan refused to speak to the media Monday or let herself bephotographed with her daughter.   She would not say how long she expects to stay in Christchurchand had no comment to all other questions. She drove her daughterthe 200 yards from the Diplomat Motel to Selwyn House school Mondayafter being alerted that photographers were waiting outside.   She took a back route to the school Monday afternoon to whiskHilary home.   Reporters have been ordered not to enter the grounds of theDiplomat Hotel, Hilary's home since mid-1988.   Also Monday, Morgan met her husband, U.S. Court of Appeals JudgePaul Michel, at Christchurch Airport. Michel told The AssociatedPress he arrived in Auckland on Sunday and spent the day talking tohis wife's lawyer, Lyn Stevens, and her senior U.S. lawyer StephenSachs.   Michel said he will stay in Christchurch for one week beforereturning to Washington.   He said he saw a ``good deal of Hilary for nearly a year beforeshe went in hiding.''   But by late Monday he still had not seen the child at the centerof the bitter custody battle.</TEXT></DOC>
