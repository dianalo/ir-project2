School officials said the college had suspended the Alpha PhiAlpha chapter's charter.   Medical examiners have not determined the cause of death of JoelA. Harris, 18, of New York, but they said he appeared to sufferfrom a heart condition.   However, his mother, Adrienne C. Harris, said Thursday her sonhad been healthy, despite undergoing open-heart surgery when he was2 years old to correct a birth defect. She said he was born withholes between the chambers of his heart, which were closedsurgically.   ``Joel was very active all his life,'' Mrs. Harris said.   Alpha Phi Alpha state director Robert Willis said the deathoccurred Wednesday at a gathering in an apartment for 19 young meninterested in joining the 110,000-member fraternity.   He said the students told him they met with approximately sevenfraternity brothers and ``were pushed and shoved around'' when theyfailed to correctly answer questions about the fraternity.   ``Next thing they knew, they looked around and the fellow waslying on the floor,'' Willis said. ``At first they thought he wasfaking it, but then when they realized he wasn't faking, theycalled 911.''   Willis said that according to the potential pledges, thefraternity brothers knew of Harris' history of heart trouble.   ``Joel wasn't really picked on,'' Willis said. ``They (pledges)said they didn't see Joel get hit.''   The fraternity's president, Gregory Burrell, could notimmediately be reached for comment Thursday. The fraternity chapterdoes not have a house, there was no telephone listing for Burrell,and a message left for him at the Morehouse dean of students officewas not immediately returned.   The fraternity _ the country's oldest black Greek-letterorganization _ prohibits hazing, which also is outlawed in Georgia.   Morehouse spokesman Robert Bolton said in a statement that thechapter also had not received clearance from school officials to``commence their pledge period'' or engage in any form ofoff-campus pledge activities.   School officials said the college also was conducting aninternal investigation and would ``take appropriate disciplinaryaction, up to and including dismissal of all participants.''   ``Clearly, the fraternity is out of line,'' Bolton said.   Dr. Joseph Burton, Cobb County medical examiner, said an autopsyof Harris failed to reveal any bruises or visible injuries.   ``Right now, it looks like he had a cardiac disrhythmia,''Burton said. ``Exactly what precipitated this, we don't know.''   Hundreds of students, friends and Morehouse faculty attended amemorial service for Harris on Thursday. Many students sobbedopenly during the ceremonies and hugged each other afterward.   ``Everybody who knew him loved him,'' said John T. Saunders III,who said he was Harris' best friend in high school. ``I loved him.''   Mrs. Harris said she would campaign to see ``that no morechildren in this country will die because of hazing. ... JoelHarris' mother will work to get it outlawed in all the states. Thisis utterly ridiculous. ... This is not right.''   Morehouse President Leroy Keith called Harris ``a young man witha well of integrity.''   Wreaths lined the front of the stage during the service at acollege chapel, and the all-male Morehouse College Glee Club sanghymns.</TEXT></DOC>
