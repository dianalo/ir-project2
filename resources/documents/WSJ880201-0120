Pratt andamp; Whitney will build 88 F-100 engines for the F-15s and 71 for the F-16s. The Air Force allotted GE 130 engines for the F-16s. The Air Force hasn't actually awarded contracts for the engine work, which will amount to $850 million.    The Air Force began the competition in 1984. Rather than invite competing bids at the outset and award the entire business to the winner, it maintains the competition on a year-to-year basis, giving the larger share to the contractor that proposes the lowest costs.    Air Force Secretary Edward Aldridge praised the competition as providing &quot;better engines at less cost.&quot; He estimated that over five years, the engine competition will save the Air Force $3 billion through lower prices.    In contracts issued Friday, Ingalls Shipbuilding, a unit of Litton Industries Inc., won a $216 million Navy award for equipment for guided-missile cruisers.    Trak International Inc. received a $115.7 million Army contract for forklift trucks.    Units of McDonnell Douglas Corp. were given contracts totaling $72.5 million for C-17 aircraft production and ballistic missile re-entry vehicle equipment for the Air Force and helicopter production for the Army.    Units of United Technologies were given contracts totaling $56.4 million for UH-60 helicopter production for the Army and aircraft engines and engine parts for the Air Force.    The Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word Health Care System won Army contracts totaling $36.2 million for health-care services.    Lockheed Shipbuilding Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp., received a $31.8 million Navy contract for landing-craft air cushion materials.
