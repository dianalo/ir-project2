(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>ISDN: HEAVY DATACOMM USERS MAY GET BUSY SIGNALandM;As part of an industrywide effort to generate more interest in IntegratedServices Digital Network (ISDN), regional telephone companies andlong-distance carriers are beginning to pitch the technology to MIS directorsas a cost-effective medium for data communications.andM;The major hurdle facing ISDN, however, is that a number of existingtechnologies already offer more effective data communications media.andO;Industry observers and ISDN supporters alike acknowledge that, for the mostpart, what can be achieved with ISDN can also be achieved by existing means.andO;At the same time, more than half of the products required to make ISDN areality are still missing from the market.andM;The most tantalizing promise made by ISDN is the integration of voice anddata at the physical layer of the network.andP;  The immediate benefit of thisconsolidation of voice and data lines is to enable companies with separatetrunk lines for voice and data to use a single trunk line for both.andO;Depending on the number of lines and the amount of traffic, this change couldresult in extensive savings of as much as 30 percent in trunk expenditures.andM;But the throughput provided by ISDN is only sufficient to handle applicationssuch as linking electronic mail systems across PC local area networks.andP;  Forsites with high-volume traffic, ISDN can best be described as yesterday'stechnology attempting to become tomorrow's standard for telecommunications.andM;The main appeal of ISDN is its ability to allow the simultaneous transmissionof voice, data and video over a single communications link.andP;  The signalingdelta (D) channel on the line lets user systems do work &quot;out of band&quot; whiledata moves over the network.andP;  For example, the system can answer a telephoneand use the D channel to call for data from a computer.andM;However, combined voice and data in the network do not automatically resultin the integrated applications often described as key benefits of ISDN,because few applications have been written with voice and data integration inmind.andM;And many of those same applications can be developed by integrating voice anddata from separate lines, rather than gathering data from a single ISDN line.andO;DEC's Computer Integrated Telephony (CIT) software uses ISDN protocols tointegrate voice and data at the application level, but it does not requireusers to migrate to a full ISDN.andM;For example, customer service applications similar to those written for ISDNare available using standard telephone and data communications technology inconjunction with DEC's CIT software.andM;Combining voice and data is not a new idea, and ISDN is designed to embracetwo international CCITT standards that have been established for the betterpart of a decade.andM;One is the Basic Rate Interference (BRI) standard, which uses two bearer (B)channels transmitting at 64Kbits per second and one D signaling channeltransmitting at 16Kbits per second.andP;  These features give BRI its alias of2B+D.andM;The other standard is the Primary Rate Interface (PRI), which is known as23B+D because it has 23 B channels transmitting at 64Kbits per second eachand one D channel, also transmitting at 64Kbits per second.andP;  The aggregatebandwidth is 1.544Mbits per second.andM;Whereas PRI services are currently offered by long-distance carriers,Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) are offering BRI services.andP;  PRIservices are available via the users' Private Branch Exchanges (PBXes); BRIservices are available directly to end-users' desks.andP;  Although a standardinterface between PRI and BRI has yet to be established, ATandamp;T does offer suchservice and other long-distance carriers plan to do so in the future.andO;Standards governing the interoperability among ISDN hardware that linksend-user devices to BRI services are also missing.andM;Meanwhile, another factor to consider is that the cost of establishing ISDNprimary rate access will include external wiring construction costs that areequivalent to establishing a Tl line, according to information from the AngusTelemanagement Group, a telecommunications industry consulting and researchcompany based in Pickering, Ontario.andM;In addition, PRI access requires software upgrades and add-in interfaceboards for a company's PBX.andP;  Interface cards range in price from $1,500 to$40,000, according to the Angus Telemanagement Group, with the high end ofthe price range representing special adapter boards for older PBXes.andO;Finally, long-distance carriers will charge from $2,000 to $3,000 to installa PRI line, as well as monthly flat fee service costs ranging from $300 to$400.andM;COSTS ON THE PREMISESandM;Additional costs will have to be absorbed to access BRI as well.andP;  BRI accessat a user's desk top requires special adapters for each piece of equipment onthat desk.andP;  ISDN terminals, telephones and host computers are referred to asCustomer Premises Equipment (CPE) in telecommunications parlance.andM;The prices of ISDN adapters for CPEs, known as network terminal type 1adapters, vary over a wide range; however, a typical host or data terminaldevice costs $1,500.andP;  Installation charges for a BRI line vary from RBOC toRBOC.andP;  Several RBOCs have yet to receive tariff approval.andM;The most visible benefit of BRI is that it can use existing twisted-pairwiring, eliminating the need for more expensive coaxial cable, as well as thelabor costs that would be required if a company did not have coaxial cablealready in place.andP;  For most companies, this could reduce the costs of networkexpansion, because most offices already have phone lines to each user's desk.andM;Finally, ISDN's BRI will allow the same line to handle different services ona call-by-call basis, compared to dedicated lines that must be configured foreach service.andM;One of the major ISDN benefits touted by telecommunications vendors is aservice called Automatic Number Identification (ANI).andP;  ANI will automaticallyidentify the originating phone number of incoming calls.andM;Some organizations see ANI as a source of value-added service that adds totheir customer appeal.andP;  Using ANI, the terminal screen on a customer servicerepresentative's desk retrieves and displays the record of a customer callingin as soon as the phone rings.andP;  Before the representative picks up the phone,he or she has the customer's record handy on his or her screen.andM;Such a capability both improves service-desk productivity and also, from thestandpoint of many a marketing director, enhances the company's image in theeyes of its customers.andM;In one example of improved productivity, an eye-care company figures it saves10 seconds per call with ANI.andP;  This company gets between 6,000 and 7,500calls a day.andP;  Shortening each call by 10 seconds means the company can handlean additional 300 calls a day, more than 77,000 per year, with no additionalstaff.andM;On top of its more efficient use of staff, the eye-care company cut itstelephone bill by more than $26,000 a year by cutting the time charges by 10seconds a call.andM;ANI is a mixed blessing, however.andP;  Some companies have reported that havingtheir telephone representatives answer the phone by saying, &quot;Hello, Mr.andO;Smith&quot;--before Mr. Smith has had the chance to identify himself to theoperator--is disturbing to many of their customers.andM;Employees can, of course, be instructed not to address prospects by name, butthe ability to provide ANI is nonetheless currently embroiled in legal debateconcerning the right to privacy.andM;Another salient ISDN feature is its capability to carry video transmissions,making the technology appropriate for video conferencing.andP;  However, untilrecently developed video-compression algorithms are widely implemented, thethroughput provided by ISDN is inadequate for high-resolution video.andM;Pioneering this type of application, ATandamp;T, Andersen Consulting in Chicago andIllinois Bell combined for the first ISDN-based international videoconnection.andM;The link connects Andersen's Chicago and Tokyo offices.andP;  The videoconferencing is done over one of Andersen's 50 ISDN lines.andP;  The line cost$146.50 to install and $16.96 a month to lease from ATandamp;T.andP;  The video servicecomes with a minimum monthly fee of $95 and a usage charge of $3.95 for thefirst minute and $2.50 for each additional minute.andM;If Andersen uses video conferencing to Tokyo two hours per day, 10 hours perweek, 40 hours per month, the cost is about $700 each month.andP;  That's a lotless than the cost of bringing the participants together for face-to-facemeetings.andM;SORRY, WRONG NUMBERSandM;But even though ISDN has some appealing aspects, MIS directors who move tothis technology now should recognize that they will still be early adoptersof the technology, although CCITT announced the standard's framework some 10years ago.andM;Users who require high levels of throughput should rule out ISDN.andP;  There isno clear price/performance gain; therefore, converting a company's datacommunications network to ISDN is probably not worth the effort.andP;  (See&quot;Throughput levels of WAN technology,&quot; page 33.)andM;On the high end of the ISDN market is a 384Kbit-per-second wideband PRIswitched data service which ATandamp;T created by giving its ISDN customers accessto its own 1.455Mbit-per-second switched data service, called the AccunetSwitched Data Service.andP;  Last month, ATandamp;T also announced that it will alsogive its customers access to the full 1.544Mbit throughput of the AccunetService.andM;Meanwhile, the RBOCs are currently field testing a T1-speed alternativedigital data service called Switched Multi-Megabit Data Service (SMDS).andP;  A45Mbit-per-second version of SMDS is expected to arrive in a few years.andM;SMDS points the way to future high-speed optical-based data communications.andO;That future technology includes Broadband ISDN (BISDN), which, at speeds ofup to 100Mbits per second, should prove more than adequate for the vastmajority of data communications needs.andM;But the fundamental problem with BISDN is that it is more than simply afiber-optic version of today's ISDN.andP;  There are differences between the twothat leave current ISDN users with little advantage over non-ISDN users whochoose to migrate to BISDN.andM;For example, interface cards will have to be swapped out and softwareupgraded.andP;  The network itself is different--users have more control overnetwork traffic.andM;And while users wait for BISDN, they can expect ISDN and TI to remain atopposite ends of the networking spectrum.andM;ATandamp;T's Bell Labs, located in Holmdel, N.J., recently ran isolated tests oftwo types of bridges for Novell Token-Ring LANs, running at 4Mbits persecond.andP;  One bridge scheme ran over Tl multiplexers; the other was a64Kbit-per-second ISDN line connected to an ATandamp;T System 75 PBX.andM;ATandamp;T's tests showed that the T1 multiplexer generally delivers 60 percenthigher data throughput than ISDN.andM;To compare the two networks, ATandamp;T first tested data transfer over thenetwork.andP;  A PC on the LAN took 1.7 seconds to get a 10-page office memo fromthe server and 16.7 seconds to get a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet comprising 127KBof data.andM;To ship the office memo LAN-to-LAN over the T1 bridge took 2.7 seconds.andP;  Overthe ISDN bridge, it took 4.5 seconds.andP;  Sending the spreadsheet LAN-to-LANover the T1 bridge took 30.6 seconds.andP;  Over the ISDN bridge, it took 49.4seconds.andM;Although the T1 connection was faster than the ISDN link, the cost differencebetween the two might not be enough to cost justify T1, despite its 60percent higher throughput.andP;  ATandamp;T's report on the tests said that the circuitcost for the ISDN bridge is $493 a month, whereas the T1 bridge circuit ran$2,700 a month, or 550 percent more than the ISDN alternative.andM;The decision between ISDN and T1 for a wide area link is relatively easy.andO;Like any lower-speed link, ISDN simply cannot haddle some applications.andP;  Lowbandwidth requirements would dictate the use of ISDN rather than a high-speeddedicated line.andM;MIS managers should note, however, that when ISDN is compared with leasedlines offering equivalent performance, the price difference is much lessdramatic.andM;ISDN PRI access from ATandamp;T costs $3,000 per D channel to install plus a flatfee of $400 each month, according to Telechoice, a telecommunications marketresearch company in Montclair, N.J.andP;  In comparison, a 64Kbit-per-secondfractional T1 line costs about $2,000 to install with monthly charges rangingfrom $500 to more than $1,000 depending on the distance of the line.andM;The break point for determining if a dedicated line is justified is if itwould carry traffic a minimum of 30 hours a week, according to informationfrom Datacom Research, a consulting and research company in Wilmett, Ill.andM;But although fees for ISDN might be relatively inexpensive, the lack of ISDNhardware and off-the-shelf applications could easily negate this benefit.andM;International Data Corp. (IDC), a market research and consulting company inFramingham, Mass., tracks the availability of ISDN products and produces aregular report called the ISDN Critical Mass Index.andM;MISSING PRODUCTSandM;From a survey of 50 vendors conducted in the middle of this year, IDCdetermined that only 36 percent of the hardware and software required to makeISDN a viable alternative to current telecommunications is in place.andM;Furthermore, IDC concludes that the critical mass, when there will be enoughhardware and software products, won't be reached until around 1995.andM;At the same time, ISDN-compliant hardware at customer sites is both rare andexpensive.andP;  Users surveyed by the Yankee Group, a market research companywith headquarters in Boston, said ISDN telephones carry price tags as high as$1,000 each.andP;  At a minimum, ISDN telephones will likely cost a company $650apiece, compared with a $20 price tag per phone for analog telephones.andM;The high cost, lack of availability of necessary products, and the ability ofexisting technologies will, for many MIS managers, leave little to recommendISDN.andM;However, in some cases where data communications requirements are minimal,ISDN does offer a price/performance ratio equivalent to that of other low-enddigital data communications services.andM;For organizations whose telephone services are the overridingtelecommunications priority, ISDN could provide cost-effective, flexibledigital service.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
