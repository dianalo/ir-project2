As currently set forth, these two systems containregistration forms, related supplements and schedules, fingerprint cards,correspondence, and reports reflecting information developed from varioussources relating to the registration or fitness of applicants, registrantsand persons  affiliated with futures commission merchants (FCMs), introducingbrokers (IBs), commodity pool operators (CPOs), commodity trading advisors(CTAs), leverage transaction merchants (LTMs) and floor brokers.\1\<NOTE/> The National Futures Association (NFA), in performing certainregistration functions on behalf of the Commission, currently maintainsthe Commission's registration records with respect to FCMs, IBs, CPOs,CTAs and their respective associated persons (APs), as well as certainregistration records of floor brokers.\2\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\<T3>See</T3> 49 FR 45472 (November 16, 1984). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\<T3>Id. See also </T3>49 FR 39593 (October 9, 1984), 49 FR 45418 (November16, 1984), 50 FR 34885 (August 28, 1985) and 51 FR 25929 (July 17, 1986). NFA has now sought Commission authority to perform certain registrationfunctions with respect to LTMs and APs of LTMs.\3\<NOTE/> In particular, NFA has requested the authority to processand, where appropriate, grant the registration applications of LTMs andAPs of LTMs. The maintenance of Commission records associated with thoseactivities is an essential aspect of any such authority granted to NFAby the Commission. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\<T3>See </T3>letter dated January 10, 1989, from Andrea M. Corcoran, Director,Division of Trading and Markets, CFTC, to Robert K. Wilmouth, Presidentof NFA, and letter dated March 13, 1989 from Daniel J. Roth, General Counselof NFA, to Mrs. Corcoran.  In that regard, NFA will be given custody, at the Commission's earliestconvenience, of the hardcopy registration records in CFTC-20 with respectto LTMs and APs of LTMs with active registration status on or after April13, 1984, the original effective date of the Commission's comprehensiverules relating to leverage transactions, except for those files pertainingto APs of LTMs who became inactive prior to January 1, 1986, which arebeing retired to the Federal Records Center. This will facilitate a smoothand orderly transition of LTM and AP of an LTM registration activitiesfrom the Commission to NFA. The Commission concurrently issued an Orderauthorizing NFA to perform the requested registration functions and tobecome custodian of the relevant records, which is published elsewherein the ``Notices'' Section of this issue.  In light of that Order and in anticipation of the Commission delegatingto NFA in the future additional registration processing functions for LTMsand APs of LTMs with respect to adverse actions, the Commission has nowmodified its description of CFTC-12 and CFTC-20 to provide for both NFA'sexpanded role and the attendant change in location of the Commission'sLTM and AP of an LTM registration records. Because the Commission believesthat delegating to NFA physical custody of LTM and AP of an LTM registrationrecords will assist NFA in carrying out responsibilities under the CommodityExchange Act, the concomitant disclosure to NFA of personal informationon individuals that may be contained in those records is permissible underthe Commission's current routine use of such information under the PrivacyAct.\4\<NOTE/> This Notice is being published to inform the public_and,in particular, individuals about whom information is maintained in eithersystem_where these Commission records will be located. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\<T3>See</T3> Routine Use No. 3 at 47 FR 44832 (October 12, 1982). <ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Systems of Records </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">CFTC-12 </ITAG>SYSTEM NAME:  Fitness Investigations.
