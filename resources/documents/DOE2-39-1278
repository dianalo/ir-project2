<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-1278 </DOCNO><TEXT>An exploratory investigation was conducted using the advanced NMR techniqueCRAMPS (combined rotation and multiple-pulse spectrometry) to provideinformation on the types of organic functionality via hydrogen typespresent on the surface of tar sand residues. The solvents hexane, toluene,and methylene chloride were used to extract the bitumen from the nativetar sand. All three solvents removed essentially all of the bitumen fromthe mineral matrix. However, the solid-state {sup 1}H NMR and diffusereflectance infrared have shown the presence of a small amount of organicmaterial still in contact with the mineral matrix. Tar sand residuesafter extraction with methylene chloride contain less organic materialthan the tar sand residues obtained after solvent extraction with hexane.The hydrogen spectra of the residues show a greater amount of aromatichydrogens than aliphatic hydrogens. Of interest were the relatively largeamounts of hydrogen caused by (1) alkyl hydrogens adjacent to ketonecarbonyl functionality, (2) hydrogens of methylene groups bridged betweenaromatic rings, and/or (3) hydrogens of methyl and ethyl substituentson aromatic rings. The infrared data on the extracted tar sand residuealso show a relatively large amount of ketone functionality. The spectraof the residues obtained from the isothermal and nonisothermal pyrolysisof the native tar sand show that a relatively large amount of bitumenstill remains with the mineral matrix even at a temperature of 380{degree}C(716{degree}F). Above 400{degree}C (752{degree}F) the {sup 1}H spectrachanged dramatically but still do not have the {sup 1}H resolution thatwas apparent in the spectra of the tar sand residues from solvent extraction.The major change in the {sup 1}H spectra of the tar sand residues afterpyrolysis above 400{degree}C was the loss of paraffinic hydrogens. 75refs., 10 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
