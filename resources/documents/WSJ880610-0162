The ruling by Judge John Gomery of Quebec Superior Court follows his previous rulings in 1986 and 1987 canceling big blocks of Javelin stock owned by fugitive financier John C. Doyle. Mr. Doyle, Javelin's former chairman, faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in Newfoundland. He has lived in Panama since 1974.    In the latest case, Judge Gomery ruled that the 13,500 shares were &quot;worthless pieces of paper&quot; because Javelin, a natural-resource concern, issued them in violation of Canadian business law. The judge also ruled that the shares' current owner, Suzanne Hillier, wasn't able to prove the shares were rightfully transferred to her.    Mrs. Hillier, a lawyer from Mississauga, Ontario, told the court she was given the shares in 1972 by her father, Leslie R. Curtis. Mr. Curtis was Newfoundland's attorney general for most of the period from 1949 to 1971 and the subject of a 1972 Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation involving alleged links between members of the Newfoundland government and Javelin. He was never charged with any wrongdoing and died in 1980.    Javelin was active in several projects in Newfoundland during the 1960s and early 1970s and gets most its revenue from royalties on an iron-ore mine in the province.    The judgment says the shares were part of a block of 70,000 shares issued by Javelin in 1970 in exchange for shares of a Javelin subsidiary, which had been issued earlier to a Panamanian company. The Javelin shares were registered in the name of a Newfoundland securities dealer and endorsed in blank -- giving apparent title to any person holding the certificate -- almost immediately.    Judge Gomery ordered the shares canceled because they had a value almost 10 times the shares received in exchange and were therefore issued in contravention of Canadian business law.    Although the judge said there isn't any direct evidence of how Mr. Curtis obtained the shares, he pointed out that Mr. Curtis told an RCMP investigator in 1972 that he once received 30,000 Javelin shares from Mr. Doyle but returned them when he realized the impropriety involved.    The judge said Mrs. Hillier gave differing accounts of how and when she received the shares, and wasn't a reliable witness. He also said Mrs. Hillier removed the shares in 1973 from a safety deposit box and hid them in a suitcase at home.    Judge Gomery concluded that Mr. Curtis gave the shares to his daughter &quot;to avoid the embarassment, to say the least, that would have occurred had they been found by the RCMP in his possession.&quot;    Mrs. Hillier first asked to have the shares registered in her name in late 1985, which led to the court case.    Javelin changed its name to Nalcap Holdings Inc. last year and completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split. At current market prices, the canceled block would have been valued at about $54,000.    Simon Potter, Mrs. Hillier's lawyer, said a decision hasn't been made on whether to appeal. Mrs. Hillier said she was &quot;totally upset and confused&quot; by the judge's ruling and said she was &quot;definitely going to appeal it.&quot;    In 1986, Judge Gomery removed Javelin's board and ordered Mr. Doyle to repay 15.4 million Canadian dollars (US$12.6 million) in compensation for alleged frauds against the company. The ruling has been appealed but hasn't yet been heard. Javelin emerged from five years of court oversight last year. </TEXT></DOC>
