Adler, president and chief executive officer, said.    Mr. Adler also noted in an interview that store receipts are running about 20% higher than last year, when the company had sales of $2.5 million. He wouldn't give specific sales or earnings forecasts.    For all of 1987, Mr. Adler expects &quot;six-figure profits,&quot; compared with $20,760 last year. Analysts note that the company's profit tends to be stated conservatively as, for accounting purposes, Moto Photo must capitalize so-called goodwill.    David A. Mason, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said sales would increase &quot;at least 50% for the year&quot; from the $9.9 million in sales last year. Moto Photo franchises and operates one-hour photo processing stores in 26 states.    One major factor that could influence earnings this year is Moto Photo's expected bid for the retail business of Fox Photo Inc., a unit of Eastman Kodak Co. Kodak has said that Moto Photo is one of 10 groups interested in Fox's retail business, which had 1986 sales of $76 million.    Fox has 198 one-hour photo finishing stores, 78 walk-in stores, which don't have the one-hour processing, and 241 kiosks. Moto Photo has 211 stores, including 32 owned or managed by the company.    Mr. Adler said that even if the company doesn't buy Fox, it will continue to grow through acquisitions, franchise sales and conversions into franchises of currently independent stores. He said that, excluding Fox, the company should have a total of 275 stores by year's end.    The photo finishing market represents a $4 billion-a-year industry, with $1.3 billion, or one-third, generated from one-hour photo finishing. That's up significantly from 1981, when one-hour photo finishing represented less than 5% of the photo finishing market.    Although many mass merchandisers and supermarkets are beginning to offer one-hour photo finishing services, Mr. Alder said he doesn't think that will preclude the growth of Moto Photo stores. &quot;We're specialists offering higher skills and more services,&quot; he says.    For example, Moto Photo offers custom framing, one-hour portraits and the transfer of prints and slides onto video. He said he doesn't believe the one-hour market is saturated, but notes a shakeout is appearing. &quot;Still, the market is growing quickly,&quot; Mr. Adler said. </TEXT></DOC>
