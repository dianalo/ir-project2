Schiffman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> HCA HUM </CO><IN> TNM PHA BON FIN </IN><TEXT>   A special committee of Hospital Corp. of America's outside directors rebuffed a $51-a-share, or $3.61 billion, buy-out offer from the company's management saying &quot;other parties&quot; had served written notice that they might be willing to top the bid. The parties weren't identified.    The committee, which was formed to consider any management buy-out offers, also said in a brief statement that it would consider buy-out proposals from anyone until Nov. 18.    The actions open the way for a possible bidding war to take over the Nashville, Tenn., company, which is the largest hospital chain in the U.S. Although the special committee said in its announcement that it hadn't made any decision to sell the company, analysts weren't convinced. &quot;It sounds to me like they're willing to sell the company and they'd like to have as much interest as possible,&quot; Todd B. Richter, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said of the outside directors.    Analysts have been speculating that the likeliest bidder would be Humana Inc., a major rival of Hospital Corp. As previously reported, the Louisville, Ky., hospital chain has hired Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to consider the possibility of making an unsolicited offer for Hospital Corp., sources close to Humana said.    Humana, also a large hospital chain, may be particularly interested in Hospital Corp.'s acute-care hospitals that are in areas where Humana is absent, analysts say. The addition of Hospital Corp. would make Humana a giant health-care concern, with revenue in excess of $9 billion annually.    But one analyst said he believes Humana isn't interested in buying the entire company, but rather might be working out some side transaction with Hospital Corp.'s management buy-out group that would allow it to get only the acute-care hospitals. He and other analysts believe the other parties interested in acquiring Hospital Corp. may include one or more firms that specialize in leveraged buy-outs.    &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if it is one of the leading LBO firms, like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which has the clout and plays in these kind of deals,&quot; said John F. Hindelong, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    The outside directors' latest action is the second time they have spurned management. Earlier, the committee told the management buy-out group, led by Thomas F. Frist Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive officer, that it wouldn't accept a $47-a-share offer that the group had not yet made but said they were considering. In the latest action, the directors refused to act on the group's formal $51-a-share offer, which expires tomorrow. Under the offer, shareholders would receive $43 in cash and unspecified securities valued at $8 for each Hospital Corp. share they own. The management buy-out group isn't expected to change its proposal at least until an outside offer is made. Analysts say Mr. Frist's group might be able to sweeten its offer, but not by much.    The special committee's latest announcement surprised analysts. They had anticipated that the outside directors would accept management's offer and then see if anyone else responded with a higher bid. &quot;They must have a pretty sound offer from other parties to discard this thing,&quot; Mr. Hindelong said of management's offer.    By holding out for a higher price, Hospital Corp.'s outside directors are taking some risk. The company's stock closed Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $48.25 a share, up $3.75, far higher than the mid-$30 range that it had been trading before management announced that it intended to take the company private a month ago. If the buy-out efforts collapse, analysts say the stock would plummet to the mid-$30s or lower.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc., in the wake of the management-led offer to acquire the company, said it is reviewing the debt ratings of Hospital Corp. for possible downgrade. About $2.2 billion in long-term debt is affected, according to the rating agency. The ratings under review include: HCA's Baa-1 senior issues, including Swiss franc bonds and industrial revenue bonds, provisional Baa-1 shelf registration, Baa-2 subordinated issues and Prime-2 commercial paper, and HealthTrust Inc.'s Baa-1 guaranteed subordinated debentures, due 2002.    The possible buy-out &quot;is expected to significantly increase financial leverage,&quot; according to Moody's. </TEXT></DOC>
