Their net income totaled $17.8 billion last year, down 1.4% from the industry's record $18.1 billion in 1985. FDIC Chairman William Seidman attributed the decline to continuing problems in the agriculture and energy fields.    Data filed with the FDIC also show that nearly 20% of the nation's federally insured commercial banks reported losses last year, up from 17% in 1985. The figures, released yesterday by the FDIC, were taken from reports the institutions are required to give the FDIC.    More than 81% of the unprofitable banks were west of the Mississippi River. One in four of the institutions in that part of the nation had losses, largely because of exceptionally high loan losses. In contrast, only one in 12 institutions east of the Mississippi was unprofitable.    Loan losses were one of the major drags on banks' earnings nationwide. Provisions for losses totaled $21.7 billion last year, up more than $4 billion, or 22.7%, from 1985. Nonperforming assets were 1.96% of total assets in 1986, up from 1.87% the year before.    In spite of that, the banks increased their total primary capital 9.2% to a record $208 billion. &quot;The ones that were performing poorly are doing so poorly, they're dragging the overall aggregate down,&quot; John Quinn of the FDIC's research division said.    Mr. Seidman, the FDIC chairman, also said &quot;it's too soon to tell&quot; what long-term effect Brazil's suspension of its interest payments will have on the U.S. banking industry. &quot;We don't see now that it's going to have any important effect in the near term,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. </TEXT></DOC>
