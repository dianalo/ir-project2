Gleason, chairman and president.   The company will officially report its results later thismonth. Profit from continuing operations rose about 10% forthe quarter on a more than 5% rise in sales, Mr. Gleason saidin an interview, exceeding the estimates of most industryanalysts. Net income declined because of the cost of closingan office related to businesses Gleason is trying to sell andlegal and other expenses associated with the planneddivestitures.</LP><TEXT>   Gleason, a 125-year-old maker of gear cutting, or shaping,machinery, in the late 1970s and early 1980s diversified intoautomated assembly systems, automobile differentials andprecision plastic and metal parts. Gleason sold the automatedassembly operation in 1987, the differential business in 1989and currently is negotiating with prospective buyers for theparts-making businesses.   Meanwhile, demand is strong for the company's newcomputer-controlled Phoenix gear-cutting systems, Mr. Gleasonsaid. In addition to gear-shaping machines, Gleason sellssoftware, tooling and measuring equipment for a total system.   Gleason's fourth-quarter profit from continuing operationswas about 88 cents a share, he said, up from $4.6 million, or80 cents a share, a year earlier. He said sales were in thearea of $54 million, up from $51.2 million in the 1989 finalquarter.   Net income, including results from businesses beingdiscontinued, was about 64 cents a share, down from $5million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier, he said.   For all of 1990, profit from continuing operationsdeclined to about $6.5 million, or $1.14 a share, from $9.8million, or $1.71 a share, in 1989, Mr. Gleason said. The1990 results included a charge of $1.4 million for an earlyretirement program, and 1989 figures included a gain of $1.2million on sale of a building.   Net income last year was about $7.1 million, or $1.24 ashare, he said. In 1989 net was $15.4 million, or $2.69 ashare, including a profit of $7.7 million from sale of thedifferential business.   Gleason Corp.'s 1990 sales from continuing businesses wereabout $176 million, up from $162.2 million in 1989, Mr.Gleason said. The Middle East war and other uncertaintiesmake forecasting difficult, but Mr. Gleason said, &quot;We have apositive outlook for 1991. We expect it to be a good year.&quot;   The year-end backlog was $126 million, down from therecord $137 million of a year earlier. The decline mainlyreflects a growing ability to ship the new Phoenix machines,Mr. Gleason said.   Shipments of Phoenix systems began in late 1989, but theequipment wasn't produced in volume until last year, Mr.Gleason said. Results for 1990, therefore, reflected someunusual costs related to production of new systems, he said.   However, the Phoenix system has been very successful, hesaid. &quot;We hit the nail on the head&quot; in meeting user needs,Mr. Gleason said. The new equipment is more productive andhas proven to be easier to install and more reliable thanprevious generations of gear-cutting machines, he said.   Customers have ordered more than 100 machines, he said,almost twice the number Gleason originally estimated it wouldsell by this time. Furthermore, most of the Phoenix systemswere purchased to replace existing gear-cutting machineryrather than for new production lines, Mr. Gleason said.That's important because the replacement demand greatlyexpands the market, he said.   Gleason's primary emphasis in the next few years will beto reorganize production of gear-cutting systems, Mr. Gleasonsaid. The company has engineered a good product, but it mustbecome a more efficient producer, he said. That requiresspeeding production through the plant, which will reduceinventories and improve deliveries, as well as cuttingoperating costs, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
