The veto means the project can go forward with only the conditions agreed upon previously by the administration and the Japanese government. Opponents are unlikely to be able to muster the votes to override the veto. While the resolution passed 72-27 in the Senate, the House vote was 262-155, short of the two-thirds required for an override.    Mr. Bush's veto, the second of his administration, was expected, in part because he has long complained about what he considers excessive congressional involvement in foreign policy.    His veto message said the resolution violates the separation of powers by injecting Congress into an area that is exclusively the president's: that of negotiating on behalf of the U.S. with foreign governments.    Mr. Bush also opposed a provision requiring the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the Congress, to report every 12 months on Japan's compliance with terms of the agreement. He said the reports would constitute intelligence gathering, which he said is an inappropriate activity for the GAO.    Chiefly, however, Mr. Bush said the additional restrictions sought by the Congress are unnecessary and would tie his hands in other such negotiations. He cited a provision barring Japan from selling or transferring any U.S.-designed technology, such as cockpit systems or engine technology. He noted that the existing agreement with Japan bars such sales without U.S. consent. Mr. Bush's veto stirred some strong reactions on Capitol Hill, where relations with lawmakers are already strained over differences in the defense budget and the tax on capital gains. Some lawmakers, moreover, continue to complain that the production agreement could allow Japan to assist its domestic aerospace industry to the detriment of U.S. companies.    &quot;When the administration enters into an agreement with a major trading partnerin this instance Japan -- that will make Japan a major trading competitor at the expense of hundreds of thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars of American wealth, I think it is time for the Congress to step in,&quot; said Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.).    The strong language aside, Congress failed to pass a resolution specifically prohibiting the transaction. And anti-Japan sentiment has cooled since the restrictive resolution was passed, especially now that Japan has been cited on other trade matters. Moreover, the veto would come up for a vote as the Mideast situation is heating up and lawmakers may be more sensitive to Mr. Bush's insistence that the U.S. speak with one voice on foreign policy.    The vetoed measure would have written into law and in some cases toughened the wording of provisions in the negotiated agreement to protect American technology and ensure that American companies get 40% of the revenue from the project. The resolution would have required the president to give the commerce secretary, who usually seeks to promote U.S. companies, a clear role in deciding details of the eventual production agreement for the FSX.    Mr. Bush's advisers, especially the National Security Council staff, objected to the stipulation. In his veto message, Mr. Bush criticized Congress for such &quot;micromanagement&quot; of foreign affairs.    General Dynamics Corp. is the chief U.S. participant on the FSX project. The Japanese counterpart is Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. </TEXT></DOC>
