The adsorbates,N/sub 2/ at 77 K and CO/sub 2/ at 195 K are often used to characterizemicroporous carbons and were selected for this purpose prior to the investigationof the adsorption of benzene at 313 K, dichlorodifluoromethane (Freon12) at 298 K and 1,1,2 trichloro-1,2,2 trifluoroethene (Freon 113) at273 K.</TEXT></DOC>
