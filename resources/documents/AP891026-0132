Turner _ chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System, whichincludes WTBS, creator of Cable News Network and owner of twoAtlanta sports teams _ told members of the National NewspaperAssociation that the biblical Ten Commandments do not relate tocurrent global problems, such as overpopulation and the arms race.   ``We're living with outmoded rules,'' Turner said. ``The ruleswe're living under is the Ten Commandments, and I bet nobody hereeven pays much attention to 'em, because they are too old.   ``When Moses went up on the mountain, there were no nuclearweapons, there was no poverty. Today, the commandments wouldn't goover. Nobody around likes to be commanded. Commandments are out.''   So Turner listed 10 rules of his own.   He called them ``the Ten Voluntary Initiatives'' and said theywould have people vowing, among other things, to help thedowntrodden, ``love and respect Planet Earth'' and limit theirfamilies to two children.   ``We are in deep, deep trouble as a species on this planet,'' hesaid. ``The tremendous challenge is: are we going to survive? Orare we going to collapse?''   Turner also said he wants somebody to come up with a positiveway for the world to end and has been thinking about holding acontest someday that would pay $500,000 to whoever writes the bestending.   ``What we've been taught in church and in school is that theworld is going to end in disaster anyway,'' he said. ``The world'sgonna be destroyed by fire; not everybody in the world believesthat.''   Turner, who started TBS with a family-owned outdoor advertisingcompany and a local independent television station, told thenewspaper group that he ventured into broadcasting almost on a lark.   ``I did all this mainly as an adventure, just for the pure oldhell of it,'' Turner said. ``That's the main reason I did it. And Iwas amazed when it worked, if you want to know the truth.   ``I said I'm going to get this news thing down. Someday I'mgoing to be the news king. Then CNN came along and now I am thenews king.''</TEXT></DOC>
