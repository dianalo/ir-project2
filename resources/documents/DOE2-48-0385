Most salt structures in the Gulf fall into threeprovinces (stocks, ridges, and sheets) that may represent different stagesof structural maturity. It has been proposed that the deeper water sheetsare more immature forms of salt features that are themselves behavingdiapirically to form stocks, folds, and basins that can be compared topresent-day nearshore counterparts. A detailed understanding of the mechanicsand history of salt intrusion is an important preliminary step towardidentifying these more remote traps. To achieve this, physical centrifugalclay modeling studies have been used to confirm complex multiphase saltemplacement models originally developed partly from seismic observations.By integrating high-quality seismic data with data from other sources,petroleum explorationists can apply their knowledge of salt tectonicsto comprehensive studies focusing not only on potential traps but alsoon detailed basin analyses and migration-pathway studies. Only by highlightingareas suitable for good source bed and reservoir development, coupledwith the proper migration and entrapment histories, can explorationistsfind plays with sufficient potential to justify drilling in the deep-waterGulf of Mexico.</TEXT></DOC>
