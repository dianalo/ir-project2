The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of crude oil, lost 10 cents to close at $18.51 a barrel on theNew York Mercantile Exchange, adding to a 19-cent slide on Thursday.   Refined products traded on the exchange also closed lower.   The September contract for home heating oil fell 0.27 cent tosettle at 51.43 cents a gallon, adding to a 0.21-cent declineThursday. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for September delivery dropped0.85 to 53.30 cents a gallon, reversing a 0.22-cent rise theprevious session.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has scheduled aSept. 23 meeting of its price monitoring committee, and although thesession is a month away and the panel has no power to change prices,traders are already cautious, said Andrew Lebow, a senior broker andanalyst with E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc.   The committee, which will meet in Geneva, can makerecommendations on oil prices _ including possible suggestions toraise the OPEC benchmark price of $18 a barrel _ to the full13-nation cartel.   Lebow said some traders have been reluctant to take speculativepositions in the market because of the uncertainty raised by themeeting.   Gasoline futures declined Friday as demand slackened, and therewas little interest in the heating oil market, Lebow said.</TEXT></DOC>
