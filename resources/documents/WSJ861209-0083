The accord, to be signed by negotiators today, is one result of a broad administration effort to restrict machine-tool imports from major foreign suppliers. It comes after a similar accord with Japan two weeks ago.    West Germany and Switzerland, the two other countries with which the U.S. sought such pacts, refused to limit their shipments here. Neither country exports as many machine tools to the U.S. as do Taiwan or Japan, and they contend that their machine-tool exports already are on the wane because the decline in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive here.    Washington had sought limits on the two European nations mainly to assure that they don't try to increase their shipments to fill the gap resulting from the two Asian countries' restraints. The Reagan administration didn't protest their refusal to limit their machine-tool shipments, but it served notice that the U.S. will impose import quotas if they try to take advantage of the accords with Japan and Taiwan.    Separately, Taiwan agreed to carry out a previous accord to open its domestic markets to more U.S.-made beer, wine and cigarettes. The two countries had agreed to that in October 1985 but had been unable to resolve several procedural issues.    Last month, Washington threatened to impose trade restrictions unless Taipei removed the procedural roadblocks. U.S. officials estimate the resolution of the dispute will result in approximately $150 million in increased sales by U.S. companies next year.    The negotiations on machine-tool restrictions were proposed by President Reagan last May 20. Domestic U.S. machine-tool companies argued that their industry was becoming so battered by imports that it might not be able to perform if the country went to war. But the president was eager to avoid making a formal decision on whether to grant relief to domestic machine-tool makers on national security grounds.    Some U.S. trade-policy makers had argued that deciding a trade case on national security grounds would set a bad precedent. The law permits such a finding, but it rarely has been used.    The machine tools Taiwan sends here primarily are manual lathes and some milling machines. In 1981, it shipped 3,825 lathes, amounting to 16.3% of the U.S. market. By 1985, the number had fallen to 2,766 units, but the figure represented 29.7% of the shrinking market for manual lathes, as more and more machine-tool users turned to computer-controlled equipment.    In the pact involving beer, wine and cigarettes, Taiwan agreed to lift its ban on beer imports, allow the sale of U.S. beer, wine and cigarettes at the country's 70,000 retail outlets, end higher markups for U.S.(produced wine and beer compared with domestic products, and allow U.S. manufacturers to promote their products. In return, the U.S. dropped unfair trade practices proceedings that it launched in late 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
