Of nine deaths associated with Hurricane Hugo's pass over PuertoRico on Sept. 18, just two came by drowning in the storm's rainsand floods, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.   Seven people died in accidental electrocutions, however, mostduring cleanup efforts.   Five electric company workmen died in separate accidentsrepairing downed power lines. A sixth man was electrocuted takingdown a TV antenna before the storm, and another man waselectrocuted when he hit a downed electric line while choppingtrees after the storm hit.   ``In the past,'' the CDC said in its weekly report,``hurricane-related mortality has occurred primarily as a result ofdrownings ... associated with storm surges'' _ the huge wave ofwater hurricanes bring at landfall.   ``It looks like the pattern may be changing,'' said Dr. RossannePhilen, a researcher with the Atlanta-based CDC. ``Because of theincreased forecasting ability we have, we're able to evacuate morepeople ahead of time.''   In Puerto Rico, more than 18,000 people were evacuated fromflood-prone areas the night before the storm.   ``But we found, unfortunately, in Puerto Rico that the cleanupefforts led to quite a few deaths,'' she said. ``People need to beaware of the possible dangers. Just because the hurricane is gone,it doesn't mean you are no longer at risk of injury or death.''   ``Public health officials ... must realize that the ... risksassociated with hurricanes extend beyond the impact phase,'' theCDC said. ``Efforts to minimize injury and other health risks forboth disaster-relief workers and the general population arecrucial.''   At least 71 deaths ultimately were attributed to Hugo as itmoved across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Carolinas andrained itself out over the northeastern United States. At least adozen deaths ultimately were logged in Puerto Rico.   The CDC said the same pattern occurred four years earlier whenTropical Storm Isabelle hammered the island, killing 95 _ only 21of whom drowned.   Researchers from the CDC are studying the effects of Hugo in theVirgin Islands and along the South Carolina coast. They planfurther analysis on the storm and the injuries and deaths thatresulted.</TEXT></DOC>
