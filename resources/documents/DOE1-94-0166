<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-94-0166 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors use NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and x-ray diffractionto determine the electronic, molecular, and crystal structure of thefuran-based title lactone. Structural properties including lattice parameters,bond lengths and angles, and electron density distribution and spin-spincoupling constants are disclosed. Hyperfine splitting observed in theNMR spectra is analyzed and the stereochemistry of the fusion of thebycyclic lactone system is determined. NMR spectra were taken on carbon13 in deuterated chloroform.</TEXT></DOC>
